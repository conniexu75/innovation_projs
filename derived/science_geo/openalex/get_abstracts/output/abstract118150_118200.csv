We demonstrate that point mutations in the cytoplasmic domains of both the α and β subunits promote constitutive signaling by the integrin αⅡbβ3. By generating charge reversal mutations, we show these “activating” mutations may act by disrupting a potential salt bridge between the membrane-proximal portions of the α and β subunit cytoplasmic domains. Thus, the modulation of specific interactions between the α and β subunit cytoplasmic domains may regulate transmembrane signaling through integrins. In addition, these activating mutations induce dominant alterations in cellular behavior, such as the assembly of the extracellular matrix. Consequently, somatic mutations in integrin cytoplasmic domains could have profound effects in vivo on integrin-dependent functions such as matrix assembly, cell migration, and anchorage-dependent cell growth and survival.

The integrin family of cell adhesion receptors are heterodimers of α and β transmembrane subunits that play key roles in important biological processes such as inflammation, wound healing, and cell growth and survival. Integrins modulate their affinity for ligands via a process termed “activation” or “inside-out” signaling(1.Williams M.J. Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H.

Furthermore, ligand binding to integrins changes the activities of cytoplasmic kinases, GTPases, and phospholipases (“outside-in” signaling)(2.Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev.

Thus, integrins are bidirectional signaling receptors conducting information both into and out of the cell. Inside-out signaling may involve the propagation of a conformational change from the integrin cytoplasmic domains to the extracellular domains resulting in high affinity ligand binding(6.O'Toole T.E.

Integrin α and β subunit cytoplasmic domains share a similar membrane-proximal organization with apolar and polar sequences following sequentially after the membrane-cytoplasm interface (Fig. 1A). The conserved sequences for the α and β subunits are -GFFKR and LLv-iHDR (highly conserved residues are uppercase, less conserved residues are lowercase, and dashes represent nonconserved residues). Deletion of these sequences in either α or β subunit cytoplasmic domain “activates” integrins, locking them in the high affinity state(8.O' Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F.

Consequently, we termed this region the integrin “hinge.” Hence, the capacity of the conserved membrane-proximal motifs to regulate the affinity state of integrins may depend on an interaction between them that constrains integrins to a low affinity state. Furthermore, studies on integrin assembly suggest that there may an interaction between the membrane-proximal portions of the α and β subunit cytoplasmic domains(12.Briesewitz R. Kern A. Marcantonio E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 997-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe point mutations in this hinge region that activate αⅡbβ3. Moreover, by generating complementary charge reversal mutations, we show these activating mutations may act by disrupting a potential salt bridge between the membrane-proximal portions of the α and β subunit cytoplasmic domains. In addition, we demonstrate that these active mutations can induce the constitutive outside-in signaling as assayed by the phosphorylation of pp125FAK and the ligand independent recruitment of αⅡbβ3 to focal adhesions.

This construct was then cut with AflII and DraIII, and the 3-kb fragment ligated with the 3.5-kb AflII-DraIII fragment of pCDβ3. pCDM8 expression vectors encoding αⅡb mutants were constructed by tripartite ligation of a 0.6-kb XbaI-BamHI cut PCR fragment encompassing the mutations, the 4.1-kb BamHI-DraIII fragment of pCDαⅡb, and the 2.6-kb DraIII-XbaI fragment of pCDM8.

Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 10.Hughes P.E.

Briefly, FITC-PAC1 binding was analyzed only on a gated subset of cells positive for αⅡbβ3 expression detected with a biotinylated non-function blocking antibody to αⅡbβ3 (D57) and phycoerythrin/strepavidin. To define affinity state, histograms depicting PAC1 staining in the absence or presence of the competitive inhibitor Ro 43-5054 (32.Alig L. Edenhofer A. Hadvary P. Hurzeler M. Knopp D. Muller M. Steiner B. Trzeciak A. Weller T. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 4393-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) were compared. The activation index (AI) was defined as 100 × (Fo - Fr)/(Fo LIBS6 - Fr LIBS6), where Fo is the median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding and Fr is the median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding in the presence of competitive inhibitor (Ro 43-5054, 1 μM). Fo LIBS6 is the median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding in the presence of 2 μM anti-LIBS6, and Fr LIBS6 is the median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding in the presence of 2 μM anti-LIBS6 and competitive inhibitor. 100-mm tissue culture plates were coated with 5 mg/ml BSA or 100 μg/ml fibrinogen and blocked with 5 mg/ml BSA. The cells were harvested and resuspended in incubation buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM MgCl2, 5.6 mM glucose, 3.3 mM NaH2PO4, and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). 1 × 107 cells were added to each coated dish and incubated at 37°C for 90 min. Cells were then washed in PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 100 kallikrein inactivating units/ml aprotinin. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the protein content was determined with the BCA reagent. 300 μg of protein from each lysate were incubated overnight at 4°C with the anti-pp125FAK rabbit polyclonal antibody BC3 (a generous gift from J. Thomas Parsons, Charlottesville, VA). Immune complexes were precipitated at 4°C with protein A-Sepharose and washed extensively in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 1 mM Na3VO4. The immune complexes were extracted into Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, and electrotransferred. Western blots were prepared and analyzed for phosphotyrosine-containing proteins as described (17.Huang M.-M. Lipfert L. Cunningham M. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) using a mixture of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies PY20 and PY72 (a generous gift from Bart Sefton, La Jolla, CA). CHO cells were transiently transfected as described (16.Chen Y.P. O'Toole T.E. Shipley T. Forsyth J. LaFlamme S.E. Yamada K.M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

The cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (methanol-free) and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. The coverslips were blocked in 10% normal goat serum, incubated with the rabbit polyclonal antibody 2308 (anti-human αⅡb) 2M. H. Ginsberg, unpublished data. and the anti-hamster β1 mAb 7E2 (18.Brown P.J. Juliano R.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 171: 303Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in 10% normal goat serum for 60 min, washed with PBS, and then incubated with the secondary antibodies, FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit in 10% normal goat serum for an additional 30 min. The coverslips were washed in PBS and mounted using FITC-guard mounting medium. The slides were examined with a Leitz Orthoplan microscope with a 100× oil immersion objective. Photographs were taken on Kodak Tmax 400 film. Cells were suspended in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum depleted of fibronectin by gelatin affinity adsorption and supplemented with purified human plasma fibronectin. All reagents were dialyzed against three changes of 100 volumes of α-minimal essential medium and passed through a 0.2-μm filter prior to addition to the culture medium. Cells were plated in 12-well HTC slides at a final density of 2.3 × 105 cells/ml and cultured for 41 h. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-human plasma Fn antibody MC54 (32 μg/ml) and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (7.5 μg/ml). Stained cell monolayers were observed using a Nikon FXA epifluorescence microscope, and representative fields were photographed using Kodak T-Max 400 or Ektachrome 1600 direct positive slide film. To define those membrane-proximal residues of the α subunit important for affinity modulation, we substituted specific residues in αⅡb with Ala. These variants were then co-expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with a wild-type β3 and the binding of PAC1, an antibody specific for the active conformation of αⅡbβ3 was used to define affinity states (14.Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The Ala substitution of αⅡb(F992), αⅡb(F993), and αⅡb(R995) activated αⅡbβ3 as determined by high affinity PAC1 binding (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, the Ala substitution of αⅡb(G991) and αⅡb(K994) had minimal effect (Fig. 1B). Therefore, Ala substitution of specific residues in the conserved membrane-proximal GFFKR motif of the α subunit can activate an integrin. The Ala substitution of αⅡb(F992A), αⅡb(F993A), and αⅡb(R995A) may activate αⅡbβ3 by the disruption of an interaction between the αⅡb and β3 cytoplasmic domains. The β3 cytoplasmic domain contains a highly conserved Asp residue that is at a similar displacement from the proposed cytoplasm-membrane interface as the highly conserved Arg-995 of αⅡb. This raises the possibility that the membrane-proximal regions may interact via a salt bridge formed between αⅡb(R995) and β3(D723). To test this idea, we expressed αⅡbβ3(D723A); this integrin bound PAC1 with high affinity (Fig. 1C). To further test the proposed salt bridge we constructed the “charge-reversal” mutants, αⅡb(R995D) and β3(D723R). Both the single mutations, αⅡb(R995D)β3 and αⅡbβ3(D723R), were in the high affinity state and exhibited spontaneous PAC1 binding (Fig. 2). However, the double charge reversal mutant αⅡb(R995D)β3(D723R) complemented the activating effect of the individual mutations. We suggest that this double mutation may restore the potential salt bridge between the α and β subunits, reforming the structural constraint which prevents the activation of the integrin. As a control, we examined the affinity state of double mutants αⅡb(R995A)β3(D723A), αⅡb(R995A)β3(D723R), and αⅡb(R995D)β3(D723A). All of these variants bound PAC1 spontaneously (data not shown). Ligand binding to integrins induces changes in cytoskeletal organization, intracellular pH, and protein tyrosine phosphorylation (outside-in signaling)(2.Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref Scopus (1469) Google Scholar, 3.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9011) Google Scholar, 4.Damsky C.H. Werb Z. Curr.

Above we described cytoplasmic domain mutations that result in constitutive inside-out signaling. To determine if these mutations caused constitutive intracellular signaling, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK)(19.Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 20.Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines A.B. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Stable CHO cell lines expressing the mutants αⅡb(F992A)β3 and αⅡbβ3(D723A) exhibited the constitutive phosphorylation of pp125FAK when in suspension (Fig. 3a). In contrast, cells expressing wild-type αⅡbβ3 only phosphorylated pp125FAK when adherent to a fibrinogen matrix (Fig. 3a). The association of integrins with specialized cytoskeletal structures termed focal adhesions, is regulated by ligand binding to their extracellular domains(21.Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). As another assay for outside-in signaling, we analyzed the effect of the activating mutations on integrin targeting to focal adhesions. To ensure that the targeting of the αⅡbβ3 variants to focal adhesions was independent of ligand binding, each was expressed with a ligand binding-deficient β3 mutant, β3(D119Y) (22.Loftus J.C. O'Toole T.E. Plow E.F. Glass A. Frelinger A.L. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 914-917Crossref Scopus (327) Google Scholar). When expressed in CHO cells plated on fibronectin, both αⅡb(R995D)β3(D119Y) and αⅡbβ3(D723R)(D119Y) were spontaneously recruited to focal adhesions formed by endogenous hamster integrins (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the distribution of αⅡb(R995D)β3(D723R)(D119Y) was diffuse, similar to that of αⅡbβ3(D119Y), and it was not recruited to focal adhesions formed by the endogenous integrins (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we conclude that these activating point mutations allow a spontaneous association of the integrin with the cytoskeleton in the absence of ligand binding. Thus, activating membrane-proximal point mutations in both integrin α and β subunits can induce constitutive bidirectional transmembrane signaling. There presently exists no three-dimensional structure of the native cytoplasmic domains of αⅡbβ3. Furthermore, a high resolution structure of this transmembrane protein may be difficult to acquire. Consequently, a mutational analysis, similar to those conducted in bacterial chemoattractant receptors (24.Yaghmai R. Hazelbauer G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and G protein-coupled receptors(23.Hogger P. Shockley M.S. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7405-7410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26.Pei G. Samana P. Lohse M. Wang M. Codina J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), can provide a viable alternative to develop a structural hypothesis of transmembrane signaling. The approach described here has led us to propose a plausible and testable mechanism for integrin signaling. Indeed, the present studies may provide insight into a general mechansim of signaling mediated by a variety of transmembrane receptors. Point mutations can constitutively activate such structurally diverse receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors, growth factor receptors, and bacterial chemoattractant receptors(23.Hogger P. Shockley M.S. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7405-7410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24.Yaghmai R. Hazelbauer G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, only in the β2-adrenergic receptor has constitutive bidirectional signaling been reported(26.Pei G. Samana P. Lohse M. Wang M. Codina J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In common with integrins, the ability of specific mutations to activate these receptors has been ascribed to the release of a “constraint” that maintains the receptor in an off state. As the topography of integrins is comparatively simple, having two parallel membrane-spanning subunits, we have been able to identify such a constraint. Utilizing charge reversal mutations, we provide direct mutational evidence for a salt bridge constraining integrins into a nonsignaling state. As reported here, membrane-proximal point mutations in both integrin α and β subunits can cause constitutive bidirectional transmembrane signaling. Signals from integrins can influence cell growth and death, and the assembly of the extracellular matrix(27.Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (2774) Google Scholar, 28.Meredith J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar, 29.Mosher D.F. Sottile J. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This raises the intriguing possibility that activating integrin mutations may produce dominant phenotypes in vivo. The assembly of a fibronectin matrix, a process important in wound healing and cell migration during development, is regulated by integrin affinity state(29.Mosher D.F. Sottile J. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30.Wu C. Keivens V.M. O' Toole T.E. McDonald J.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Therefore, fibronectin matrix assembly could be perturbed by activating integrin mutations. To test this idea, we used CHO B2 cells that are unable to assemble a fibronectin matrix due to a lack of the appropriate integrins(31.Wu C. Bauer J. Juliano R.L. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21883-21888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of these cells with the constitutively active mutant αⅡbβ3(D723R) enabled them to assemble a fibronectin matrix (Fig. 4). In contrast, CHO B2 cells expressing wild-type αⅡbβ3 failed to make a fibronectin matrix (Fig. 4). Thus, activating point mutations in the integrin cytoplasmic domains can influence the assembly of the extracellular matrix. It will be interesting to determine if such mutations could account for some of the increased deposition of extracellular matrix that characterizes certain pathological states."

Based on these findings, we reassess the mechanisms by which many oxidative agents affect the MTP and resolve conflicting reports on the relative role of PN and glutathione oxidation in the permeability transition within the framework of MTP (dys)regulation at two separate sites.

The mechanism(s) by which oxidants induce opening of the MTP has been the subject of many studies, often carried out without realizing that the permeability transition was at least partially involved (see the thorough discussion by Zoratti and Szabo'(4)). Work by Lehninger and co-workers pointed to the role of the oxidation-reduction level of PN in the modulation of mitochondrial Ca2⁺ fluxes, showing that PN oxidation caused Ca2⁺ efflux, which could be reversed by PN reduction(19.Lehninger A.L. Vercesi A. Bababunmi E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1690-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Several subsequent studies, however, showed that Ca2⁺ efflux and the redox state of PN could be dissociated (20.Nicholls D.G. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21.Wolkowicz P.E. McMillin-Wood J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10348-10353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that PN oxidation could be the consequence rather than the cause of the permeability transition and therefore of Ca2⁺ efflux(22.Beatrice M.C. Palmer J.W. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8663-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations undermined the PN hypothesis of regulation of Ca2⁺ efflux, now ascribed to MTP opening(4.Zoratti M. Szabo' I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). Another potential target for oxidant species that received considerable attention in MTP (dys)regulation is mitochondrial glutathione ((4.Zoratti M. Szabo' I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar) and references therein). In an influential study, Pfeiffer and co-workers (23.Beatrice M.C. Stiers D.L. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were able to independently modulate the NAD/NADH, NADP/NADPH, and GSSG/GSH ratios and concluded that the latter was the relevant factor since permeabilization could be observed after glutathione oxidation under conditions where the PN pool was kept fully reduced. This correlation was subsequently challenged by the finding that the permeability transition induced by organic hydroperoxides could be inhibited by butylhydroxytoluene while glutathione remained oxidized (24.Carbonera D. Azzone G.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 943: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and by the observation that oxidation of glutathione with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (which prevents PN oxidation by inhibiting glutathione reductase) was not followed by Ca2⁺ efflux due to a permeability transition(25.Hoek J.B. Rydström J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The effect of several oxidative agents on mitochondrial membrane permeability has recently been rationalized within the framework of the MTP voltage dependence(1.Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent pore gating potential (i.e. the threshold voltage for pore opening) is shifted to more negative Δψ levels by dithiol oxidation, resulting in a higher probability of pore opening at physiological membrane potentials(1.Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, dithiol reduction or substitution with NEM is accompanied by a shift of the apparent gating potential to less negative Δψ levels, resulting in a lower probability of pore opening(1.Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dithiol responsible for these effects can be selectively blocked by derivatization with MBM, which can therefore be used as a probe for the pore agonists that act at this site(27.Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Several open questions remain. Is oxidation of the MBM- and NEM-sensitive dithiol linked to changes in the oxidation-reduction state of mitochondrial PN and/or glutathione? Is there a role for PN and glutathione oxidation in regulation of the apparent MTP voltage dependence, and what is their relative contribution? In this paper we describe the properties of two distinct sites that affect the probability of MTP opening through oxidation-reduction reactions. The first site is blocked by NEM but not by MBM and appears to be in redox equilibrium with the PN pool. The second site is blocked by MBM, coincides with the oxidation-reduction-sensitive dithiol we have recently identified(1.Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is presumably in equilibrium with the glutathione pool. The existence of at least two oxidation-reduction-sensitive regulatory sites on the MTP in equilibrium with both PN and glutathione readily resolves many conflicting reports in the literature and allows a better description of the MTP response to oxidative stress under a variety of in vitro conditions. Rat liver mitochondria were prepared as described(28.Costantini P. Petronilli V. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Toxicology. 1995; 99: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The fraction of mitochondria permeabilized to sucrose by MTP opening and the membrane potential were determined as described in detail elsewhere ((29.Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (30.Zoratti M. Favaron M. Pietrobon D. Azzone G.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), respectively). PN and glutathione levels were determined after preincubation of mitochondria under the conditions specified in the table legends. The sequence of the addition of Ca2⁺, EGTA, inducers, and inhibitors was as shown for Fig. 1, while rotenone, when present, was included from the beginning of the experiments. Incubation conditions were identical to those of the light-scattering experiments, except that the FCCP concentration was 200 nM. PN or glutathione determinations were carried out 1 min after the addition of FCCP. NADH and NADPH levels were determined on alkaline extracts and GSH level was determined on acid extracts based on coupled enzyme reactions exactly as described in (23.Beatrice M.C. Stiers D.L. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the glutathione measurements, the concentration of mitochondria was increased up to 2 mg of protein × ml⁻1 with a corresponding increase of all reagents (EGTA, Ca2⁺, FCCP, CsA, AsO, AcAc, etc.). Since the total thiol content determined with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at 412 nm in the same extracts gave exactly the same values of the direct glutathione measurements, the latter procedure was routinely used. All chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Incubation conditions and further experimental details are given in the figure legends. In the experiments of Fig. 1, rat liver mitochondria energized with succinate in the presence of rotenone were incubated in a sucrose-based medium containing 1 mM Pi. The light scattering of the mitochondrial suspension at 540 nm was monitored, and the fraction of mitochondria permeabilized to sucrose as a result of MTP opening was determined as described(29.Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the accumulation of a 20 μM Ca2⁺ pulse, EGTA was added to prevent Ca2⁺ redistribution at the moment of uncoupler addition, followed by 40 nM FCCP (causing a depolarization of about 40 mV from the initial value of about −200 mV, see e.g.Figure 3:, Figure 4:). This concentration of uncoupler was not able to open the MTP, indicating that under these conditions the threshold voltage for MTP opening was less negative than about −160 mV (Fig. 1, A and B, traces a). When 0.5 mM AcAc was added after Ca2⁺ accumulation, however, the addition of FCCP was followed by MTP opening in a large fraction of mitochondria (panel A, trace b). The effect of AcAc was completely prevented by NEM (panel A, trace d) but not by MBM (panel A, trace c). It is well known that the addition of AcAc in the presence of rotenone oxidizes mitochondrial PN and that this effect is counteracted by BOH (see Table 1 and (4.Zoratti M. Szabo' I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar) and (31.Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for its relation to MTP opening). Interestingly, the shift caused by AcAc on the threshold voltage for MTP opening was counteracted by BOH (panel A, trace e). It should be mentioned here that, at variance from BOH (see Table 1), NEM did not prevent PN oxidation by AcAc (not shown). In the experiments of Fig. 1B, the shift of MTP response to depolarization was induced with AsO, a selective dithiol cross-linker (32.Zahler W.L. Cleland W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 716-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and well characterized MTP agonist(1.Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The addition of 40 nM FCCP was again followed by MTP opening, which could be counteracted by both NEM (panel B, trace d; cf. (1.Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and MBM (panel B, trace c; cf. (27.Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). The novel finding of this experiment is that the effect of AsO (or of its analog PhAsO, not shown) could not be blocked by BOH (panel B, trace e), which instead blocked the effects of AcAc (compare panels A and B). Fig. 2 summarizes a series of experiments carried out as shown in Fig. 1, where the concentration dependence of the effects of MBM, BOH, and NEM was studied. The experiment documents that (i) MBM was not able to inhibit the effects of AcAc at concentrations that fully prevented the effects of AsO (Fig. 2A) (this was also the case with dithiothreitol, which did not inhibit the effects of AcAc at concentrations that fully reverted the effects of AsO (not shown, but see (1.Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar))); (ii) that conversely, the effects of AsO were totally insensitive to concentrations of BOH that fully prevented the effects of AcAc (panel B); and (iii) that both the effects of AcAc and AsO were completely blocked by identical concentrations of NEM (panel C). The effect of AcAc on the MTP response to uncoupler has not been reported previously, and it was investigated further. Fig. 3 shows that the AcAc-dependent shift was observed in a whole range of uncoupler concentrations (panel A) and that the effect could be referred to a shift in the threshold for MTP opening (panel B), since the Δψ response to uncoupler, as measured in CsA-treated mitochondria to prevent pore-dependent depolarization, was unaffected by AcAc per se (panel B, inset). To modulate the oxidation-reduction state of PN with an independent method, in the experiments of Fig. 4 succinate-energized mitochondria were incubated in the absence or presence of rotenone. It can be seen that omission of rotenone (open symbols) led to a dramatic increase of the population responding to FCCP relative to that observed in the presence of rotenone (closed symbols). Also in this case the Δψ response to uncoupler was identical in the absence or presence of rotenone (panel B, inset), indicating that rotenone omission caused a shift in the MTP gating profile (panel B). This rotenone-dependent shift could be largely inhibited by NEM but not by MBM or dithiothreitol (not shown). Superimposable results, not shown here, were obtained with rolliniastatin-2, a site I inhibitor that is not structurally related to rotenone(33.Degli Esposti M. Ghelli A. Ratta M. Cortes D. Estornell E. Biochem J. 1994; 301: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial PN are in oxidation-reduction equilibrium with matrix glutathione through PN transhydrogenase and glutathione reductase (see e.g.(23.Beatrice M.C. Stiers D.L. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (34.Reed D.J. Savage M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). Thus, depending on the experimental conditions glutathione oxidation may or may not cause PN oxidation and vice versa, which makes correlations between MTP open probability and oxidation of PN and/or glutathione difficult to establish a priori. To address the relative role of PN and glutathione oxidation in the shifts of MTP voltage dependence observed here we have carried out parallel determinations of NADH, NADPH, and reduced glutathione levels. The MTP response to graded additions of FCCP is somewhat variable in different mitochondrial preparations (see (1.Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (29.Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for a discussion). In these experiments we have therefore chosen FCCP concentrations giving maximal uncoupling. The following results give therefore an upper limit for PN or glutathione oxidation under the experimental conditions of Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:. Table 1 shows that the addition of FCCP in the presence of rotenone did not appreciably oxidize PN or glutathione. As expected, NADH and NADPH oxidation could be achieved by either the addition of AcAc, or the omission of rotenone, both conditions affecting the MTP response to depolarization (see Figure 3:, Figure 4:). On the other hand, under both conditions glutathione remained fully reduced, and the difference between reduction levels of PN and glutathione was particularly large in the case of rotenone omission. These data indicate that under our experimental conditions the PN oxidation-reduction state is related to the MTP gating profile independently of changes in the oxidation-reduction state of glutathione. Table 1 also shows that in the presence of rotenone and FCCP the addition of AsO, which under these conditions causes pore opening, was not accompanied by oxidation of either PN or glutathione. The experiment therefore indicates that the oxidation-reduction-sensitive dithiol (1.Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can affect the MTP gating profile independently of changes in the oxidation-reduction state of PN. It appears likely that the AsO-reactive dithiol is in equilibrium with glutathione and that the AsO-complexed species, which is equivalent to the disulfide for MTP regulation(1.Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cannot be reduced by glutathione and becomes thus unavailable for its natural oxidation-reduction partner (see also Table 3). In the experiments of Table 1 CsA was included to prevent any secondary effects of MTP opening on reduced PN and glutathione levels. In the experiments of Table 2, CsA was omitted and MTP opening was induced by AsO plus FCCP (i.e. by a condition that does not affect the level of reduced PN when the MTP is blocked by CsA; Table 1). Under these conditions PN oxidation could be reproducibly observed, confirming earlier reports that PN oxidation may well follow rather than precede the permeability transition(22.Beatrice M.C. Palmer J.W. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8663-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Beatrice M.C. Stiers D.L. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Reed D.J. Savage M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that CsA was preventing PN oxidation by mechanism(s) unrelated to its inhibitory effects on the pore, we have measured PN and glutathione levels in AsO- and FCCP-treated mitochondria in the absence of CsA, but under conditions where MTP opening was prevented by the addition of MBM, NEM, or EGTA. The results, also presented in Table 2, indicate that PN remained reduced irrespective of the method used to prevent pore opening. These data indicate that PN oxidation is more likely to be the consequence than the cause of MTP opening when dithiol cross-linkers like AsO or PhAsO are used as the agonists, at variance from a recent suggestion to the contrary(35.Schweizer M. Durrer P. Richter C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 967-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the experiments of Table 3 we tested the effects of the organic hydroperoxide, TBH and of the dithiol oxidant, DIA on the levels of reduced PN and glutathione. 2Note that the standard error is extremely large in the measurements with TBH, particularly in the presence of MBM. We have no explanation for this variability, which is anomalous relative to all the other conditions tested. These widely used pore agonists (e.g.(1.Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) were both able to promote oxidation of PN and glutathione, as reported by many authors (e.g.(23.Beatrice M.C. Stiers D.L. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), and their effect was more pronounced on the levels of NADH. The addition of NEM and MBM, which block the effects of TBH and DIA on the pore (1.Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) partially prevented oxidation of NADH induced by TBH and DIA, while NEM but not MBM prevented oxidation of NADPH. Since both NEM and MBM form adducts with reduced glutathione in the matrix (no reduced glutathione could be detected in their presence; Table 3), these data are in full agreement with earlier observations that oxidation of mitochondrial PN by TBH is only possible through the combined action of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and PN transhydrogenase, and it is therefore prevented when glutathione is not available(36.Lötscher H.R. Winterhalter K.H. Carafoli E. Richter C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4340-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these data suggest that DIA may be affecting the MTP through the same pathway as TBH. In this paper we have shown that the apparent MTP gating potential can be modulated by oxidation-reduction effectors at two sites that can be distinguished experimentally. One site (which we will now call the “P site”) appears to be modulated through the oxidation-reduction state of PN even when glutathione is fully reduced, and it accounts for the effects of MTP agonists like AcAc (19.Lehninger A.L. Vercesi A. Bababunmi E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1690-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) or duroquinone(37.Chernyak B.V. Dedov V.N. Chernyak V.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The P site can be blocked by NEM but not by MBM. The other site (which we will now call the “S site”) coincides with the oxidation-reduction-sensitive dithiol(1.Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it can be activated by reaction with AsO or PhAsO even when the PN pool is fully reduced. The S site can be blocked by both NEM and MBM. It appears that oxidants like TBH and DIA can oxidize both PN and glutathione and thus affect both the P and S sites. Irrespective of the precise mechanism by which glutathione and PN affect the MTP, oxidative stress causes an increased probability of pore opening when the concentrations of reduced glutathione and PN decrease. The relative role of PN and glutathione in controlling mitochondrial membrane permeabilization to solutes has been addressed in a large number of studies, but the results are contradictory, and an unequivocal answer is still missing (see (4.Zoratti M. Szabo' I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar) for a critical analysis and references therein for all the original contributions). In an early study, Pfeiffer and co-workers (23.Beatrice M.C. Stiers D.L. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) addressed this issue by correlating pore opening by TBH plus Ca2⁺ to the oxidation-reduction state of mitochondrial PN and glutathione. Ca2⁺-dependent permeabilization was observed (i) when NADH, NADPH, and glutathione were oxidized; (ii) when NADH and glutathione, but not NADPH, were oxidized; and (iii) when PN were fully reduced and only glutathione was oxidized. It was inferred that only the oxidation of glutathione was relevant to membrane permeabilization and that PN oxidation was more likely to follow than to precede pore opening(23.Beatrice M.C. Stiers D.L. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only missing condition in (23.Beatrice M.C. Stiers D.L. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was one where PN were fully oxidized while the glutathione pool was kept in the reduced state. Such a condition is described in the present paper and has revealed an independent role for PN in MTP regulation, as suggested in early work on the permeability transition (reviewed in (4.Zoratti M. Szabo' I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar)). Our findings demonstrate that MTP opening is correlated to both the oxidation-reduction state of PN through the P site and (presumably) of glutathione through the S site. We would like to stress that there is no direct evidence here or in the literature that glutathione as such is involved in pore regulation. Indeed, many glutathione oxidants could also directly oxidize the dithiol S site at the same time. Furthermore, since PN and glutathione are in oxidation-reduction equilibrium through PN transhydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and possibly mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase (38.Lenartowicz E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1088-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), reagents like TBH and DIA can lead to oxidation of both glutathione and PN, thus affecting both sites at the same time. While the NEM- and MBM-sensitive S site coincides with the dithiol we recently identified(1.Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the NEM-sensitive P site remains chemically undefined. Indeed, although the NEM reactivity may suggest that a cysteine thiol group is involved, no other compound we tested among a variety of thiol reagents (including mersalyl and methyl methanethiosulfonate, data not shown) was able to block the P site. In principle, NAD(P)H (we could not resolve which PN is responsible, even if the data of Table 3 would suggest a better correlation with NADH levels) might affect the MTP as a reductant, possibly through a voltage-sensing element that could also be reduced by glutathione. However, it should be mentioned that the P site is insensitive to reductants like dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol (data not shown). An alternative possibility is that PN may directly interact with the P site modulating the MTP response to voltage by an allosteric mechanism, which is consistent with the NADH-specific inhibitory effect on the MTP reported by Hunter and Haworth (5.Hunter D.R. Haworth R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 39.Haworth R.A. Hunter D.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 54: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) in deenergized mitochondria. An example of regulation of a channel by PN can be found for the voltage-dependent anion channel of the outer mitochondrial membrane, where NADH (but not NAD⁺, NADPH, or NADP⁺) decreases the permeability to ADP by a factor of 6(40.Lee A-C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concept that the MTP is modulated by oxidating agents at two sites resolves several standing problems. It is clear from the experiments presented here that the PN and glutathione oxidation-reduction state does not necessarily affect MTP opening in an all-or-nothing fashion. In other words, pore opening may or may not follow PN and/or glutathione oxidation, depending on additional factors like e.g. the magnitude of the membrane potential, the Ca2⁺ load, and the level of endogenous adenine nucleotides. Yet, under oxidative conditions the apparent gating potential is demonstrably shifted toward the resting level (Figure 3:, Figure 4:). This explains why MTP opening (and the ensuing Ca2⁺ efflux) can be dissociated from the oxidation-reduction state of PN and glutathione and why an unequivocal correlation between MTP opening and oxidation-reduction levels of either glutathione or PN alone could not be established, even if it is widely accepted in the field that pore operation is indeed affected by the mitochondrial redox state(4.Zoratti M. Szabo' I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). We have already pointed out the similarities between many aspects of MTP modulation and those of well characterized channels like the N-methyl-D-aspartate and the ryanodine receptors(3.Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 41.Bernardi, P., Petronilli, V. (1996) J. Bioenerg. Biomembr., in pressGoogle Scholar). Interesting analogies also exist with voltage-gated K⁺ channels (KV channels) The voltage inactivation properties of the α/β KV channels can be modulated by glutathione through a cysteinyl residue close to the N terminus. This residue can be located on either the pore-forming α subunit in rapidly inactivating (A-type) KV channels (42.Ruppersberg J.P. Stocker M. Pongs O. Heinemann S.H. Frank R. Koenen M. Nature. 1991; 352: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) or on the regulatory β1 subunit, which confers the rapidly inactivating mode to otherwise slowly inactivating KV channels(43.Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). In either case, rapid inactivation may involve formation of a disulfide with a second cysteinyl residue in an as yet unidentified channel region(42.Ruppersberg J.P. Stocker M. Pongs O. Heinemann S.H. Frank R. Koenen M. Nature. 1991; 352: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 43.Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Also relevant to the present discussion, it has been noted that KV channel β subunits bear a striking resemblance (both in terms of primary sequence and of secondary structural elements) to the superfamily of NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases, with conservation of the PN binding site, suggesting that PN binding could be involved in KV channel regulation(44.McCormack T. McCormack K. Cell. 1994; 79: 1133-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It must be stressed that oxidation-reduction-sensitive K⁺ channels exist in Escherichia coli(45.Meury J. Robin A. Arch. Microbiol. 1990; 154: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which bear sequence homology to the mammalian and Drosophila α/β KV channels (46.Milkman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3510-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The MTP might have conserved structural features of the archetypal K⁺ channel and thus accomplish modulation of its voltage-dependence by glutathione and PN by similar mechanisms. We conclude that (i) the MTP is modulated by the oxidation-reduction state of mitochondria through both PN and (presumably) glutathione at the P and S sites, respectively, and (ii) suggest that this modulation is accomplished through a change of the threshold potential for MTP opening. Mitochondrial (dys)function during oxidative stress is now increasingly considered as a key event in a variety of forms of cell death, ranging from ischemia (47.Pastorino J.G. Snyder J.W. Serroni A.

Because of its exquisite sensitivity to oxidative stress the MTP appears as a likely target on which many pathological agents or conditions may converge. Definition of the structural features that make the MTP sensitive to oxidation-reduction events at the P and S sites may well lead to novel tools for therapeutic intervention, and it is a major challenge for future research in our laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W1978195377,"Escherichia coli strain K12 was grown at 17, 27, and 37°C. The acyl chain composition of the membrane lipids varied with the growth temperature; the fraction of cis-vaccenoyl chains decreased, and the fraction of palmitoyl chains increased, when the growth temperature was increased. However, the polar head group composition did not change significantly. The equilibria between lamellar and reversed non-lamellar phases of lipids extracted from the inner membrane (IM), and from both the membranes (IOM), were studied with NMR and x-ray diffraction. At temperatures above the growth temperature the lipid extracts formed a reversed hexagonal phase, or a bicontinuous cubic phase, depending on the degree of hydration of the lipids. It was observed that: 1) at equal elevations above the growth temperature, IM lipid extracts, as well as IOM lipid extracts, have a nearly equal ability to form non-lamellar phases; 2) IM extracts have a stronger tendency than IOM extracts to form non-lamellar phases; 3) non-lamellar phases are formed under conditions that are relatively close to the physiological ones; the membrane lipid monolayers are thus “frustrated”; and 4) as a consequence of the change of the acyl chain structures, the temperature for the lamellar gel to liquid crystalline phase transition is changed simultaneously, and in the same direction, as the temperature for the lamellar to non-lamellar phase transition. With a too large fraction of saturated acyl chains the membrane lipids enter a gel state, and with a too large fraction of unsaturated acyl chains the lipids transform to non-lamellar phases. It is thus concluded that the regulation of the acyl chain composition in wild-type cells of E. coli is necessary for the organism to be able to grow in a “window” between a lamellar gel phase and reversed non-lamellar phases.

It is thus concluded that the regulation of the acyl chain composition in wild-type cells of E. coli is necessary for the organism to be able to grow in a “window” between a lamellar gel phase and reversed non-lamellar phases. Practically all membranes contain significant amounts of at least one lipid species that forms non-lamellar phases under physiological conditions (Ansell et al., 2.Ansell G. Hawthorne J.N. Dawson R.M.C. Form and Function of Phospholipids. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1973Google Scholar; Goldfine, 14.de Kruijff B. Verkleij A.J. Leunissen-Bijvelt J. van Echteld C.J.A. Hille J. Rijnbout H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 693: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many membrane lipids can transform from a lamellar to a non-lamellar phase by changes in biologically relevant conditions such as the pH value, the concentration of divalent cations, the temperature, and the hydration (for a review, see Lindblom and Rilfors (45.Lindblom G. Rilfors L. Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 1992; 41: 101-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). It is well documented that all kinds of organisms adapt their membrane lipid composition to the prevailing environmental and physiological conditions. Three strategies seem to be utilized: changes in the acyl chain structure, changes in the polar head group structure, and reshuffling of acyl chains to form new lipid molecular species without changing the average acyl chain composition (Hazel and Williams, 27.Hazel J.R. Williams E.E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 167-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar; Suutari and Laakso, 43.Lindblom G. Orädd G. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1994; 26: 483-516Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The regulation of the membrane lipid composition by the cell wall-less bacterium Acholeplasma laidlawii strain A-EF22 has been intensively studied in our laboratory. The organism can be grown under conditions where the regulatory changes occur predominantly in the polar head group structures. The conclusion has been drawn that the cells strive to maintain a certain balance between the lipids constituting a bilayer structure and those forming reversed non-lamellar structures (Lindblom et al., 41.Lindblom G. Brentel I. Sjölund M. Wikander G. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7502-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 42.Lindblom G. Hauksson J.B. Rilfors L. Bergenståhl B. Wieslander Å.

A. laidlawii strain A-EF22 synthesizes eight membrane lipids of which three are able to form non-lamellar phases: monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (MGlcDAG), 1The abbreviations used are: MGlcDAGmonoglucosyldiacylglycerolDGlcDAGdiglucosyldiacylglycerolPEphosphatidylethanolaminePGphosphatidylglycerolDPGdiphosphatidylglycerolPCphosphatidylcholineLᵦlamellar gel phaseLαlamellar liquid crystalline phaseHⅡreversed hexagonal phaseCSAchemical shift anisotropyIOMinner plus outer membraneIMinner membrane. and the monoacylated derivatives of MGlcDAG and diglucosyldiacylglycerol (DGlcDAG) 2A.-S. Andersson, L. Rilfors, M. H. J. Bergqvist, and G. Lindblom, submitted for publication. (Lindblom et al., 1993; Rilfors et al., 1993). Moreover, four of these lipids are uncommon, namely the lipids having an acyl group or a glycerophosphoryl group linked to the head groups of MGlcDAG and DGlcDAG (Hauksson et al., 24.Hauksson J.B. Lindblom G. Rilfors L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25.Hauksson J.B. Lindblom G. Rilfors L. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1995; 1258: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium butyricum has also been used to investigate the regulation of the membrane lipid composition and, in resemblance with A. laidlawii, these cells can be grown under conditions where the regulation of the composition is primarily confined to the structures of the polar head groups (Goldfine et al., 1987a, 19.Goldfine H. Rosenthal J.J.C. Johnston N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 904: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The purpose of the lipid regulation in C. butyricum was suggested to be the same as in A. laidlawii, although most of the membrane lipids differ between the two organisms. C. butyricum synthesizes at least eight membrane lipids. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and its plasmalogen form, plasmenylethanolamine, form non-lamellar phases under physiological conditions, and two of the lipids are uncommon (glycerol acetal and phosphatidylglycerol acetal derivatives of plasmenylethanolamine) (Goldfine et al., 1987b; Johnston and Goldfine, 35.Johnston N.C. Goldfine H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 961: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). monoglucosyldiacylglycerol diglucosyldiacylglycerol phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylglycerol diphosphatidylglycerol phosphatidylcholine lamellar gel phase lamellar liquid crystalline phase reversed hexagonal phase chemical shift anisotropy inner plus outer membrane inner membrane. In the present work we have studied the metabolic regulation and the phase equilibria of the membrane lipids from wild-type cells of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. The reasons for this are manifold: E. coli is recognized as one of the foremost prokaryotic model organisms; the bacterium has only three main membrane phospholipids which occur frequently in prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic organisms; and the regulation of the lipid composition in wild-type cells is brought about by changes in the acyl chain structure, above all in the degree of unsaturation of the acyl chains (Marr and Ingraham, 49.Marr A.G. Ingraham J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1962; 84: 1260-1267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is a very common response to changes in the environmental temperature among a variety of organisms (Hazel and Williams, 1990). A large number of biochemical and physico-chemical studies have been carried out on E. coli membranes and membrane lipids (Cronan et al., 7.Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 474-497Google Scholar; Cronan and Rock, 9.Cronan Jr., J.E.

C.1987: 31-55Google Scholar and references therein). A lipid biosynthetic mutant of E. coli was recently used to study the polymorphic regulation of the membrane lipid composition (Rietveld et al., 61.Rietveld A.G. Killian J.A. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12427-12433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 62.Rietveld A.G. Chupin V. Koorengevel M.C. Wienk H.L.J. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28670-28675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant lacks the ability to synthesize PE which constitutes about 75-80 mol % of the membrane lipids in wild-type E. coli cells and has the ability to form non-lamellar phases (Cullis and de Kruijff, 11.Cullis P.R. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 513: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar; Rilfors et al., 65.Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Wieslander Å. Christiansson A. Manson L.A. Kates M. Biomembranes. 12. Plenum Press, New York1984: 205-245Google Scholar). It was suggested that one of the remaining lipids, diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), together with divalent cations can replace the role of PE and that E. coli also exhibits a polymorphic regulation of its membrane lipid composition (Killian et al., 38.Killian J.A. Koorengevel M.C. Bouwstra J.A. Gooris G. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; Rietveld et al., 1993, 1994). No studies have so far been undertaken to elucidate if there exists a relationship between the regulation of the lipid composition, and the transition between lamellar and non-lamellar phases, in wild-type cells of E. coli grown at different temperatures. Moreover, the presence of an outer and an inner membrane in E. coli, having different chemical compositions and functions, raises the question whether this phase equilibrium differs between the membranes. Therefore, in this work we have studied the lamellar to non-lamellar phase transitions of lipids extracted from the inner membrane and from both the membranes of E. coli. The E. coli wild-type strain K12, kindly provided from the Department of Microbiology at the Umeå University, was used in all experiments. Cells were grown at aerobic conditions in Luria broth (LB medium consisting of 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 10 g of NaCl/liter distilled water, pH 7.5) at 17, 27, and 37°C. The growth medium was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of an overnight culture grown at the same temperature as the main culture, and the cells were grown under vigorous agitation in Erlenmeyer flasks (200 ml of medium in 2-liter flasks; 200 rpm) or in an Electrolux fermentor (6-8 liters of medium; 20 liters of air/min; 800 rpm). In the fermentor the pH value was kept constant at 7.5 by using aqueous solutions of 2 M HCl and 5 M NaOH, and a 15% (v/v) dispersion of silicon oil in water was used as an antifoam agent. Normally about 40 ml of HCl, 20 ml of NaOH, and 5-10 ml of antifoam agent were consumed for a 6-liter culture in the fermentor. The cells were grown until late log phase (A550 = 0.8 or 1.8 in Erlenmeyer flasks and fermentor, respectively), harvested by a centrifugation at 11,300 × gmax for 15 min at 4°C, washed once in buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl and 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.0), and finally suspended in the same buffer. Portions of the cell pellet were taken aside for preparation of the inner plus outer membrane (IOM) lipid extracts before disruption in a French press. All the subsequent steps were carried out on ice or at 4°C if not otherwise mentioned. The cells were lysed by disruption in a French press, and the outer and inner membranes were separated in Percoll gradients as described by Morein et al.(52.Morein S. Henricson D. Rilfors L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The purity of the inner membrane (IM) fractions was checked by the NADH oxidase activity (Osborn and Munson, 55.Osborn M.J. Munson R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; . 31: 642-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and the 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate content (Karkhanis et al., 36.Karkhanis Y.D. Zeltner J.Y. Jackson J.J. Carlo D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) as described in Morein et al.(1994). The membrane material was collected, and the remaining Percoll was removed by three centrifugation steps: one at 50,000 rpm in a Ti70 rotor in a Beckman LE-70 preparative ultracentrifuge and two at 70,000 rpm in a TLA100.3 rotor in a Beckman bench top TL-100 ultracentrifuge. During these centrifugation steps the membrane material sediments as a layer on top of a clear Percoll pellet. After the last centrifugation, no Percoll pellet could be seen. The cells or the inner membranes were extracted twice with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and once with methanol, in an ice water bath on a magnetic stirrer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and non-lipid contaminants were removed by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 Fine (Wells and Dittmer, 1963). The lipids were then applied to a silicic acid column (Bio-Sil HA minus 325 mesh, Bio-Rad). The column was first eluted with chloroform to remove the neutral lipids (mainly free fatty acids and small amounts of monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, and pigments), and next the phospholipids were eluted with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The phospholipids were then converted to their sodium salts by a modified version of the procedure by Smaal et al.(73.Smaal E.B. Romijn D. Geurts van Kessel W.S.M. de Kruijff B. de Gier J. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 634-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described by Rilfors et al.(1994). The polar head group compositions of the IOM and IM lipid extracts were determined by first separating the lipids by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on glass plates precoated with a 0.25-mm-thick layer of Silica gel 60 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany); the chromatograms were developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:10, v/v). The spots were visualized by iodine vapor, and the phospholipids were identified with known reference lipids. The phosphate content in each spot was determined according to Chen et al.(6.Chen Jr., P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5805) Google Scholar) with the following changes. The reagent mixture contained 1 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid, 1 ml of 10% ascorbic acid in water, and 1 ml of 2.5% ammonium molybdate in water, per 10 ml. After the ashing procedure, 4 ml of the reagent mixture was added to each test tube. The color was developed at 65°C for 6 min in a water bath. The acyl chain compositions were determined by gas chromatography using the methyl esters of the fatty acids (Rilfors, 63.Rilfors L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 813: 151-160Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The lipids, dissolved in chloroform, were first dried to a film with a stream of N2 in an 8-mm glass tube and then dried to constant weight in vacuum. After addition of 2H2O, the tubes were flame-sealed. The lipids were pelleted in the bottom of the tube by centrifugation with a Beckman J2-YY centrifuge in a JA20.1 rotor at 12,900 × gmax for 60 min. All samples were freeze-thawed repeatedly and equilibrated at room temperature in darkness over night before the NMR measurements. The samples contained approximately 15-20 mg of IM lipids or approximately 35-50 mg of IOM lipids. 31P NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker ACP-250 spectrometer at 101.27 MHz. A phase cycled Hahn echo sequence (Rance and Byrd, 58.Rance M. Byrd R.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 52: 221-240Google Scholar) with high power proton decoupling was used. The 90° pulse was 10 μs, and the spectral width was 100 kHz. A relaxation delay of 1 s was used. A variable temperature unit was used to control the air flow around the sample in the spectrometer, and the temperature in the probe was measured with a calibrated thermistor. During the temperature dependence measurements the samples were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at each temperature before recording the spectra. All experimental free induction decays (FIDs) were transformed from Bruker to Felix format by the routines in Felix 2.0, which was used to process all spectra. A line broadening of 50 Hz was applied before Fourier transformation. The lipid diffusion coefficient in a cubic phase formed by a total lipid extract prepared from E. coli was determined by the pulsed magnetic field gradient technique (Lindblom and Orädd, 1994), and the 1H NMR spectra were recorded as described in Lindblom et al.(1993). X-ray investigations of the cubic phase mentioned in the previous section were performed at Station 8.2 at the Daresbury Laboratory (Cheshire, United Kingdom) using a monochromatic beam of wavelength 1.5 Å. The experiments were performed at 76°C. The IOM lipid extracts all contained about 75-80 mol % PE, 15-20 mol % phosphatidylglycerol (PG), 2-6 mol % DPG (Table 1) and trace amounts (less than 1 mol %) of a lipid that probably is phosphatidic acid. The IM lipid extracts contained the same phospholipids, but with slightly less PE (70-75 mol %) and a larger fraction of PG and DPG (18-22 and 6-8 mol %, respectively) than in the IOM lipid extracts (Table 1). The phospholipid head group composition did only change marginally as a function of the growth temperature. The small differences noted are not larger than the variation between different extracts obtained from the same growth temperature.Tabled 1 The acyl chain compositions of the different lipid extracts are summarized in Table 2. Palmitoyl (16:0), palmitoleoyl (16:1c9), and cis-vaccenoyl (18:1c11) chains are the dominating acyl chains in all lipid extracts. The fraction of unsaturated acyl chains, above all 18:1c11, was decreased when the growth temperature was increased. In the IOM phospholipid extracts from E. coli grown at 17°C there was 60 mol % unsaturated acyl chains compared with 45 mol % in the corresponding extracts from E. coli grown at 37°C, while E. coli grown at 27°C had an intermediate fraction of unsaturated acyl chains. It is also evident that the average acyl chain length decreased when the growth temperature was raised (Table 2). Finally, it was found that the acyl chains of the IM lipids have a higher degree of unsaturation and are slightly longer. From a comparison of our gas chromatograms with those obtained by Cronan and Rock(8.Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3069-3071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we suggest that the unidentified acyl chains probably consist mainly of 9,10-methylene-hexadecanoyl chains and a small fraction of 11,12-methylene-octadecanoyl chains.Tabled 1 31P NMR was used to investigate the phase behavior of the lipid-water systems. The line shape of the 31P NMR signal depends on the symmetry of the phospholipid aggregates (Brentel et al., 1987; Cullis and de Kruijff, 10.Cullis P.R. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 436: 523-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar; Lindblom et al., 1986; McLaughlin et al., 51.McLaughlin A.C. Cullis P.R. Berden J.A. Richards R.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 20: 146-165Google Scholar). A lamellar liquid crystalline (Lα) phase gives rise to a spectrum with a high field peak and a low field shoulder. Lipids in a reversed hexagonal (HⅡ) phase cause a spectrum with a low field peak and a high field shoulder. The measured chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) for the HⅡ phase is smaller, and of reversed sign, as compared with that obtained for the Lα phase. Isotropic solution phases (e.g. micellar phases) and cubic liquid crystals usually cause a single, relative narrow 31P NMR signal. Multiphase systems cause a superposition of the line shapes characteristic of each phase present. The phase behaviors of IOM and IM phospholipid extracts hydrated with 20 and 50 weight % 2H2O were investigated in the temperature range from 25 to 65°C. The IOM phospholipid extract from E. coli grown at 37°C, and hydrated with 20 weight % 2H2O, formed an Lα phase up to above 55°C (Fig. 1A). At 65°C a low field peak can be seen at 5 ppm, most probably due to the formation of an HⅡ phase. The CSA of the spectra is approximately −45 ppm within the whole temperature range. A corresponding lipid extract from E. coli grown at 27°C formed an Lα phase up to 45°C; an HⅡ phase started to form at 55°C, and the fraction of this phase increased when the temperature was raised further (Fig. 1B). The CSA of a spectrum recorded at 45°C is approximately −50 ppm. Finally, the IOM lipid extract from E. coli grown at 17°C, and hydrated with 20 weight % 2H2O, showed an Lα phase up to 35°C (Fig. 1C). For this lipid extract the transition from an Lα to an HⅡ phase is apparent already at 45°C, and at 65°C the spectral component from the HⅡ phase dominates the spectrum. The CSA of a spectrum recorded at 45°C is approximately −50 ppm. 31P NMR spectra were also recorded for all samples after the temperature had been lowered to 35°C (Fig. 1, A-C), and the HⅡ phase had almost disappeared after 30 min equilibration at this temperature. Moreover, all samples were repeatedly stored at −20°C, freeze-thawed, and equilibrated as described under “Materials and Methods,” and a new series of 31P NMR spectra were recorded between 25 and 65°C; nearly identical spectra were obtained each time. From Fig. 1, A-C it is concluded that the fraction of lipids in the HⅡ phase was approximately the same in the three IOM lipid extracts when spectra were recorded at equal elevations above the growth temperature. When the water content in the IOM lipid extracts was increased from 20 to 50 weight %, a change in the phase behavior was observed. 31P NMR spectra recorded from the lipid extract isolated from E. coli grown at 17°C, and hydrated with 50 weight % 2H2O, are shown in Fig. 1D. An Lα phase was observed up to 45°C, and by raising the temperature further, there was a transition from an Lα to an isotropic phase as seen by the appearance of a narrow symmetrical signal in the spectra. An isotropic phase was formed also in the IOM lipid extracts isolated from E. coli grown at 27 and 37°C and hydrated with 50 weight % 2H2O; in these extracts the isotropic phase appeared at temperatures above approximately 60 and 70°C, respectively (data not shown). Fig. 2a summarizes the fraction of non-lamellar phases obtained at 65°C for the different IOM lipid extracts. For each phospholipid extract a decrease in the fraction of non-lamellar phases is observed when the water content is increased from 20 to 50 weight %. It is striking that the fraction of non-lamellar phases in the lipid extracts, hydrated with 20 weight % 2H2O, increases from 0-10% to 90-100% as a result of the modulation of the acyl chain composition when the growth temperature of the E. coli cells is decreased from 37 to 17°C. The isotropic phase obtained in the IOM lipid extracts isolated from E. coli grown at 17°C (Fig. 1D) was investigated by x-ray diffraction. Ten separate reflections were obtained which were shown to originate from a cubic liquid crystalline phase belonging to the space group Pn3m (Fig. 3). From the plot shown in Fig. 3 it can be calculated that the length of the unit cell is 148.1 Å. A 31P NMR spectrum recorded after the temperature had been lowered from 65 to 35°C for a sample forming the cubic phase, and after the sample had been equilibrated at this temperature for 30 min, shows that the fraction of the cubic phase had not decreased (Fig. 1D). This hysteretic behavior is a characteristic feature of bicontinuous cubic phases (Lindblom and Rilfors, 44.Lindblom G. Rilfors L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 221-256Crossref Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The presence of a bicontinuous cubic phase was established by measurements of the lipid diffusion coefficient with the pulsed magnetic field gradient technique (Lindblom and Orädd, 1994). A diffusion coefficient of 8.5•10⁻12 m2 s⁻1 was obtained at 60°C, which is close to the value obtained at 65°C in a bicontinuous cubic phase formed by PE isolated from Bacillus megaterium (Rilfors et al., 64.Rilfors L. Khan A. Brentel I. Wieslander Å. Lindblom G. FEBS Lett. 1982; 149: 293-298Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and is of the same order of magnitude as the lateral diffusion coefficient observed for lipids in bilayers (Lindblom and Orädd, 1994). 31P NMR spectra recorded from IM lipid extracts isolated from E. coli cells grown at 37, 27, and 17°C are shown in Fig. 4. The samples were hydrated with 20 weight % 2H2O and can therefore be compared with the corresponding spectra recorded from the IOM lipid extracts (Fig. 1, A-C). The IM lipid extracts all transformed from an Lα to an HⅡ phase when the temperature was raised; however, the HⅡ phase appeared at temperatures approximately 10°C below the temperatures found for the corresponding IOM lipid extracts (Fig. 4, A-C). It is concluded also for the three IM lipid extracts that the fraction of lipids in the HⅡ phase was approximately the same when 31P NMR spectra were recorded at equal elevations above the growth temperature. A comparison of the phase equilibria exhibited by IOM and IM lipid extracts, hydrated with 20 weight % 2H2O, is shown in Fig. 2b. At each growth temperature, there is a larger fraction of non-lamellar phases at 65°C in the IM extracts than in the IOM extracts isolated from the same batch of cells. This difference is clearly seen for the lipid extracts isolated from cells grown at 27 and 37°C. The difference in phase behavior for the lipid extracts isolated from cells grown at 17°C is masked at this high temperature. However, the different tendencies of these extracts to form non-lamellar phases are evident in 31P NMR spectra recorded at 45 and 55°C. Moreover, by comparing Fig. 2a with Fig. 2b it is seen that the IM lipid extract (17°C) has a greater ability to form non-lamellar phases than the IOM lipid extract (17°C) when they are hydrated also with 50 weight % 2H2O. When the water content was increased in the IM lipid extracts, a decrease in the fraction of non-lamellar phases was observed (Fig. 2b), in similarity with the IOM lipid extracts. Some investigations were also performed on IOM lipid extracts in which the neutral lipids were still present (see “Materials and Methods”). These lipid extracts were generally more prone to adopt non-lamellar phases. It is noteworthy that IOM lipid extracts (containing the neutral lipids) isolated from all the three growth temperatures, and hydrated with 70 weight % 2H2O, were able to form an isotropic phase; the lipids isolated from cells grown at 37°C started to form the isotropic phase between 50 and 60°C, while this phase appeared between 40 and 50°C in the lipids isolated from cells grown at 27 and 17°C. When the E. coli cells were grown in the fermentor, a 15% (v/v) dispersion of silicon oil in water was used as antifoam agent. To check whether the silicon oil could have any influence on the phase behavior of the isolated lipid extracts, cell cultures were grown in LB in Erlenmayer flasks with and without the antifoam agent, but otherwise under identical conditions. The IOM phospholipids were extracted as described under “Materials and Methods.” However, 31P NMR measurements on these lipid extracts did not show"

We have shown previously that a secretory group II phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) is the enzyme responsible for most of the AA released to the incubation medium. By using selective inhibitors for each of the PLA2s present in P388D1 macrophages, we demonstrate herein that the cytosolic group IV PLA2 (cPLA2) mediates accumulation of cell-associated AA during the early steps of P388D1 cell activation. The contribution of both cPLA2 and sPLA2 to AA release can be distinguished on the basis of the different spatial and temporal characteristics of activation and substrate preferences of the two phospholipase A2s (PLA2s). Furthermore, the results suggest the possibility that a functionally active cPLA2 may be necessary for sPLA2 to act. cPLA2 action precedes that of sPLA2, and overcoming cPLA2 inhibition by artificially increasing intracellular free AA levels restores extracellular AA release. Although this suggests cross-talk between cPLA2 and sPLA2, selective inhibition of one other PLA2 present in these cells, namely the Ca2⁺-independent PLA2, does not block, but instead enhances receptor-coupled AA release. These data indicate that Ca2⁺-independent PLA2 does not mediate AA mobilization in P388D1 macrophages.

https://openalex.org/W2076261991,"The interactions of H-Ras, R-Ras, and Rap1A with the Ras-binding domains (RBD) of the c-Raf kinase and of the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RGF) was studied biochemically in solution. From deletion cloning the RGF-RBD was defined as a 97-amino acid-long fragment from the C-terminal end of the human RGF, which is an independent folding domain with high stability. Interestingly, whereas H-Ras binds with high affinity (KD = 20 nM) to Raf-RBD and with low affinity (KD = 1 ÂμM) to RGF-RBD, Rap1A shows the opposite behavior. The binding of both RBDs to R-Ras is weak and shows no specificity. The interaction between Rap1A and RGF-RBD shows similar characteristics to the Ras-Raf interaction because it is blocked by mutations in the effector region (D38A) and it inhibits the dissociation of guanine nucleotide, which is the basis for the quantitative measurements in this work. Furthermore, the binding of RGF-RBD inhibits the interaction between Rap1A and Rap-GAP. As long as the cellular localizations of the different proteins and their biological functions are not clarified, these biochemical data seem to indicate that Ral-guanine nucleotide exchange factors is an effector molecule of Rap1A rather than of H-Ras."

Aggregation studies with synthetic Aβ1-40 peptide by the thioflavin T fluorescence assay and electron microscopy and cytotoxicity assays using rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells showed that an antibiotic, rifampicin, and its derivatives, which possess a naphthohydroquinone or naphthoquinone structure, inhibited Aβ1-40 aggregation and neurotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. Hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone, and 1,4dihydroxynaphthalene, which represent partial structures of the aromatic chromophore of rifampicin derivatives, also inhibited Aβ1-40 aggregation and neurotoxicity at comparable molar concentrations to rifampicin. Electron spin resonance spectrometric analysis revealed that the inhibitory activities of those agents correlated with their radical-scavenging ability on hydroxyl free radical, which was shown to be generated in cell-free incubation of Aβ1-40 peptide. These results suggest that at least one mechanism of rifampicin-mediated inhibition of Aβ aggregation and neurotoxicity involves scavenging of free radicals and that rifampicin and/or appropriate hydroxyl radical scavengers may have therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease.

https://openalex.org/W1545357297,"The developmentally arrested third stage infective larva of hookworms resumes development upon entry into the definitive host. This transition to parasitism can be modeled in vitro by stimulating infective larvae with a low molecular weight ultrafiltrate of host serum together with methylated glutathione analogues. When stimulated to resume development in vitro, activated larvae of the hookworm Ancylostoma caninum released a 42-kDa protein, termed Ancylostoma-secreted protein (ASP). ASP was the major protein released by activated hookworm larvae. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers, based on a partial internal amino acid sequence of the protein, were used together with flanking vector sequence primers to amplify a fragment from a third stage larval cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction. The fragment was used as a probe to isolate a longer clone from the larval cDNA library. The full-length ASP cDNA was found to encode a 424-amino acid protein with homology to the antigen 5/antigen 3 family of proteins from hymenopteran venoms and a family of cysteine-rich secretory proteins. ASP was expressed in bacterial cells, and a polyclonal antiserum against purified recombinant ASP was produced. The antiserum, which was demonstrated to be specific for ASP, was used as a probe to measure the kinetics of ASP release by hookworm larvae. ASP is released within 30 min of stimulation, with the majority released by 4 h. Low levels of ASP were released continuously following activation, but only if the stimuli were present in the incubation medium. The compound 4,7-phenanthroline, previously shown to inhibit larval activation, also inhibited release of ASP.

The initial events of the infectious process can now be modeled in vitro, using the resumption of feeding as a marker for the transition from the free-living L3 to the developing parasitic L3(1.Hawdon J.M.

When free-living L3 of the canine hookworm Ancylostoma caninum are stimulated to resume feeding in vitro, they release several molecules into the culture medium. Recently, a zinc metalloprotease activity has been reported from activated A. caninum L3 ES products(4.Hawdon J.M. Jones B.F. Perregaux M.A. Hotez P.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 80: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation, cloning, and expression of a 40-kDa protein from activated ES products, referred to as Ancylostoma-secreted protein (ASP), that is homologous to the major venom allergen of hymenopteran insects. ASP is the major protein released by activated hookworm L3. Its release during invasion of the host, together with its partial homology to previously described allergens from insect venoms, suggest that it may orchestrate key events in the patho- and immunobiology of hookworm infection. A. caninum was maintained as described previously(3.Hawdon J.M. Schad G.A. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 77: 489-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). L3 were collected from 1-4 wk-old coprocultures by the Baermann technique, and decontaminated with 1% HCl in BU buffer (50 mM Na2HPO4, 22 mM KH2PO4, 70 mM NaCl, pH 6.8) (5.Hawdon J.M. Schad G.A. J. Helminthol. Soc. Wash. 1991; 58: 140-142Google Scholar) for 30 min at 22°C. Approximately 3500-7500 L3 were incubated in individual wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate containing 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium, supplemented with 0.25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B. The L3 were activated to resume development and feeding by including 15% (v/v) of a <10-kDa ultrafiltrate of canine serum and 25 mMS-methylglutathione(4.Hawdon J.M. Jones B.F. Perregaux M.A. Hotez P.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 80: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Nonactivated L3 were incubated in RPMI alone (i.e. without the stimulus). The L3 were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. The percentage of feeding L3 was determined by incubating aliquots of L3 with 2.5 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bovine serum albumin for 2-3 h, followed by counting the number of L3 that had ingested the labeled bovine serum albumin by microscopic examination under epifluorescent illumination(6.Hawdon J.M. Schad G.A. J. Parasitol. 1990; 76: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Medium containing activated larvae was transferred to individual microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 rpm. The tubes were placed on ice for 10 min to slow the swimming motion of the larvae. The supernatant containing the ES products was carefully transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, and inspected visually using a dissection microscope to assure that no L3 had been transferred. Supernatants were pooled and stored at −20°C. Prior to electrophoresis, supernatants were concentrated 4-10 times by lyophilization or ultrafiltration using Centricon 10 cartridges (Amicon, Beverley, MA). ES products from approximately 50,000 activated A. caninum L3 were concentrated and electrophoresed in a 12.5% acrylamide gel (7.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) under nondenaturing conditions. The major band of Mr = 40,000 was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and excised. Approximately 98 pmol of isolated protein were digested with trypsin in situ as described elsewhere(8.Williams K.R. Stone K.L. Crabb J. Techniques in Protein Chemistry VI.

Enzymatic digests were fractionated by reverse phase HPLC on a Hewlett Packard 1090 HPLC system, and several peaks were quantified by laser desorption mass spectrometry prior to sequencing, as described previously(8.Williams K.R. Stone K.L. Crabb J. Techniques in Protein Chemistry VI. Academic Press, New York1995: 143-152Google Scholar). Degenerate oligonucleotide primers, corresponding to the EPDALG portion of protein sequence and synthesized in both orientations, were used to amplify an ASP gene-specific product from DNA isolated from an A. caninum L3 cDNA library constructed in γZAP II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The preparation of the cDNA library is described elsewhere(10.Hawdon J.M. Jones B.F. Hotez P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The degenerate primers were paired with flanking vector primers (T3 or T7 promoter) in a PCR. The PCR conditions were 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), and 75 ng of phage DNA, containing the L3 cDNA library, in a 20-μl reaction. Preliminary experiments indicated that amplification using the sense strand degenerate primer ASP-5 (Table 1) and the T7 primer produced a 550-bp product. Ten identical reactions containing only the DNA and primers in 10 μl were subjected to “hot start” PCR(11.Arnheim N. Erlich H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 131-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The reactions were heated at 94°C for 5 min, then lowered to 85°C for 5 min, during which time the remaining reaction components were added. This was followed by 30 cycles of 1 min of denaturation at 94°C, 1 min of annealing at 45°C, and 2 min of extension at 72°C. The PCR reactions were pooled, digested with PstI and KpnI, and separated by electrophoresis in a 3% low melting point NuSieve GTG agarose gel (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The 550-bp band was excised, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and melted at 65°C. The melted agarose was frozen in a dry ice-ethanol bath and immediately centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube, ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in 7 μl of distilled H2O, and cloned into pBluescript by standard methods. Double-stranded plasmid DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy method(12.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar, 13.Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar), using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemical-Amersham Corp, Cleveland, OH) and sequential synthetic oligonucleotide primers.Tabled 1 The A. caninum L3 cDNA library was propagated in XL1-BLUE cells, and plated according to standard methods(14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 8.3-8.82Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 105 plaques were screened with an RNA probe made by transcription of linearized pBluescript containing the 550 bp of PCR product with T3 RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of α-[32P]UTP. Hybridization conditions were as follows: 6 × SSPE (1 × SSPE = 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA), 10 × Denhardt's solution (1 × = 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% Ficoll 400), 1.0% SDS, 200 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 50% formamide, and the radiolabeled probe (≈1.2 × 106 cpm/ml) at 42°C for 18 h. Filters were washed with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C for 45 min, 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C for 30 min, and 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C for 60 min (1 × SSC = 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate), and exposed to XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensifying screen for 7 h at −70°C. Two rounds of plaque purification resulted in eight clones, which were rescued by in vivo excision of their plasmid DNAs(15.Short J.M. Sorge J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNAs (pBluescript) were isolated by standard procedures, and digested with EcoRI and XhoI to release the inserts. Two of the eight inserts were of different sizes, of approximately 1000 and 1200 bp. The 5′ and 3′ ends were sequenced using T3 and T7 primers, respectively. Both clones had 3′-poly(A) tails and identical 3′ sequences. The 5′ ends were different, but further sequencing indicated that the shorter clone was a truncated version of the longer clone, renamed pASP-1. Restriction mapping indicated internal EcoRI and NcoI restriction sites (Fig. 1), which were utilized for subcloning to facilitate sequencing. Both strands were sequenced completely. A modified 5′-RACE technique was used to isolate the 5′ end and start codon of the ASP cDNA(16.Templeton N.S. Urcelay E. Safer B. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 48-51PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar, 18.Jain R. Gomer R.H. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 58-59PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 400 mg of frozen A. caninum L3 were ground to a powder in a mortar chilled in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1 pmol of ASP gene-specific primer 1 (GSP-1) (Fig. 1 and Table 1) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was ethanol precipitated in the presence of 10 μg of yeast tRNA and resuspended in 200 μl of distilled H2O. A poly(dG) tail was added to the 3′ end of the cDNA using terminal deoxytransferase. A 50-μl reaction containing 33.5 μl of cDNA, 1 mM dGTP, and 15 units of terminal deoxytransferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Following tailing, the reaction was extracted once with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 150 μl of distilled H2O. Two μl were used as template for the first PCR reaction, containing 25 pmol of GSP 2 antisense primer, located internally to the primer used for RT (Fig. 1 and Table 1), together with 25 pmol of a 5′-poly(G) anchor primer (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The 50-μl reaction was subjected to 40 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 48°C, and 1 min at 72°C. Following amplification, 1 μl of the reaction was used in a second PCR reaction, which was identical to the first, except that a third nested antisense primer, GSP-3 (Fig. 1 and Table 1) with a 5′-EcoRI restriction site, was substituted for GSP-2, and the annealing temperature increased to 55°C. Four reactions were pooled, extracted with phenol and chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and digested with BamHI and EcoRI. The inserts were gel purified, cloned into pBluescript, and sequenced as above. Sequence editing, alignments, and comparisons were performed using the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) on a VAX 7610 computer. The potential signal sequence cleavage sites was determined using the PSIGNAL program (PC/GENE Release 5.18, Intelligenetics, Mountain View, CA) on a personal computer. A 1-kb EcoRI/XhoI fragment containing the 3′ end and poly(A) tail of ASP-1 (Fig. 1) was cloned in-frame into the pET28(c) expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and used to transform competent BL21 Escherichia coli cells (F⁻ompT hsdSB (r⁻Bm⁻B) gal dcm). Log-phase cells were induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and incubated for 3 h at 30°C. One-ml aliquots were removed at 0, 1, 2, and 3 h of induction and examined by SDS-PAGE (7.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and Western blotting (see below). For purification of rASP, a 2-liter culture of BL21 cells containing the recombinant plasmid pET28:ASP was induced as described above. The cells were centrifuged, the pellet resuspended in 60 ml of 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 6 mg of lysozyme, and incubated at 30°C for 30 min. The solution was sonicated using a Branson 450 Sonifier (30% duty cycle, output setting 3) until it was no longer viscous and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 60 ml of 1.0% SDS, 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and cooled to 22°C. The extract was dialyzed (Mr = 12,000-14,000) against 2 liters of 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 days at 22°C, with two changes of buffer. The cell extract was applied to a 10-ml HisBind resin column (Novagen), and chromatography was conducted according to the manufacturer's instruction, except that 0.1% SDS was added to all buffers. The expressed protein, containing a 6-residue histidine tag (His-Tag, Novagen) that bound it to the Ni⁺ resin, was eluted from the column with 0.1-1.0 M stepwise gradient of imidazole, dialyzed as above, and isolated by preparative SDS-PAGE on 11% acrylamide gels. rASP antiserum was produced by immunization of a New Zealand White rabbit with gel-purified rASP. The gel slices were macerated and injected subcutaneously with complete Freund's adjuvant. Additional boosts with purified rASP in incomplete Freimd's adjuvant were administered at 3, 6, and 9 weeks. Vesq Ag5 antiserum was produced by immunization of a New Zealand White rabbit with purified Vespula squamosa Ag5 (Vesq Ag5) in complete Freund's adjuvant in multiple intradermal sites(19.Hoffman D.R. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1985; 75: 599-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The antigen was estimated to be over 98% pure by SDS-PAGE and protein sequence analysis(20.Hoffman D.R. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1985; 75: 611-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Specificity of the antisera was confirmed by its adsorption with purified rASP. rASP was coupled to 3 M Emphaze beads (Pierce, Rockford, IL) by incubating 0.2 g of beads with 0.27 mg of rASP in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% SDS, 0.8 M sodium citrate, pH 8.0, overnight at 22°C. The beads were sedimented by gentle centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the coupling reaction was stopped by adding 10 ml of 1.0 M Tris, pH 8.0, followed by incubation at 22°C for 2.5 h. The beads were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and stored at 4°C. rASP antiserum (1:500) and Vesq Ag5 antiserum (1:2000) were diluted in 5% NFDM-P, and 10 ml were incubated with 0.2 ml of ASP-conjugated beads overnight at 4°C. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used in a Western blot (see below). Concentrated ES products or rASP were separated in 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P poly(vinylidene fluoride) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electroblotting at 20 V for 16-18 h at 4°C(21.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked with 5% NFDM-P for 6-8 h at 4°C. Following blocking, the membrane was incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of rabbit anti-Vesq Ag5 antiserum or a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-rASP antiserum in NFDM-P for 16-18 h at 4°C. After three washes in NFDM-P, the membrane was incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at 22°C. Bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). In vitro activation experiments were conducted to determine the kinetics of ASP release. In these experiments, the presence of ASP in ES products was determined by Western blotting using rASP antiserum as a specific probe. To determine when ASP is first released by activated L3, individual wells containing approximately 6000 activated L3 were harvested at 30 min and 1, 4, and 24 h of incubation, and the ES products were removed and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Nonactivated L3 incubated for 24 h in RPMI alone were used as a negative control. The percentage of feeding L3 in the population was determined at 24 h. To determine if ASP was released continuously during the activation process, the ES products of a single population of L3 were sampled over time. A well containing approximately 6500 L3 was incubated under standard activation conditions. At 1, 4, and 24 h of incubation, the L3 were removed and pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The L3 were washed three times with 15 ml of RPMI and returned to a new well. Fresh medium containing the stimuli was added, and the incubation was resumed, except at 24 h, which was the terminal time point. A negative control (no stimuli) and a positive control (entire 24-h activated L3 ES product output) were harvested at 24 h. The percentage of feeding L3 was determined at 24 h. To determine whether the presence of the stimulus was required for continuous ASP release, two wells containing 6000 L3 were incubated with the stimulus for 1 or 4 h. At these times, the ES products were harvested, and the L3 were washed three times with RPMI and reincubated in RPMI alone (i.e. without the activation stimuli). At 24 h, the ES products were harvested again, and the percentage of feeding L3 was determined. Activated and nonactivated larvae incubated for 24 h were used as controls, with their ES products collected at 24 h only. 4,7-Phenanthroline, a known feeding inhibitor(4.Hawdon J.M. Jones B.F. Perregaux M.A. Hotez P.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 80: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), was tested for its effect on ASP release. Approximately 6000 L3 were incubated with 0.5 mM 4,7-phenanthroline and activation stimuli for 24 h. Following incubation, the ES products were harvested and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The ES products from all experiments were examined by Western blotting using rASP antiserum as described above. Autoradiographs of Western blots were scanned using a HP Scanjet IIcx digital scanner (Hewlett-Packard, Corvallis, OR) using HP DeskScan version 2.0 software on a Power Mac 6100 (Apple Computers, Cupertino, CA). The image was saved as a TIF file, and analyzed using NIH Image software version 1.54 (Wayne Rasband, NIH). Areas of the bands were selected by drawing a rectangle around the band. An area of identical size, to be used as a measure of the background level, was selected from the negative control lane at the same position as the positive bands. Therefore, values are expressed relative to the negative control, which although not visible, might register in the scan. Total intensity of the area was calculated by NIH Image, the background value was subtracted, and the corrected pd was used for comparisons. When A. caninum L3 are stimulated to resume feeding in vitro, they release a major product of approximately Mr = 40,000, referred to as ASP. In contrast, no proteins are detected in the ES products of nonactivated L3 (not shown). Microsequencing of a trypsin digestion product of this protein revealed a peptide with the sequence GLEPDALGGNAPK. A degenerate primer derived from the EPDALG portion of this sequence, together with a primer complementary to flanking vector sequence, amplified a fragment of approximately 550 bp from phage γ DNA containing an A. caninum L3 cDNA library. This product was used as a probe to isolate a 1.2-kb cDNA clone encoding ASP from the A. caninum L3 cDNA library. The cDNA contained a 3′ poly(A) tail, but lacked a 5′ initiation codon. The 5′ end containing the ATG (Met) start codon was isolated from L3 cDNA by 5′-RACE(16.Templeton N.S. Urcelay E. Safer B. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 48-51PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar, 18.Jain R. Gomer R.H. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 58-59PubMed Google Scholar). Four 5′ end clones were sequenced, and found to encode identical sequences that were in frame with and overlapped the cDNA clone. Unlike another hookworm cDNA recently cloned in our laboratory(10.Hawdon J.M. Jones B.F. Hotez P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), none of the 5′ sequences contained the conserved nematode SL 1 or SL 2(22.Nilsen T.W. Annu. Rev.

Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1277-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), nor could the 5′ end be amplified from cDNA using SL 1 primer and an internal gene-specific primer. The full-length cDNA encodes an ORF of 424 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 45,735, a pI of 7.13, and a 34-bp 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). The entire sequence of the original peptide purified from ES products was present in the ORF (amino acids 255-267), confirming that this cDNA encodes the ASP molecule. The amino-terminal 18 amino acids are highly hydrophobic (11/18), and a potential eukaryotic signal sequence cleavage site is located between amino acids 18 (A) and 19 (S)(25.von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar), consistent with the secretory nature of the protein. There are no N-linked glycosylation sites present in the ORF. Data base comparison (SwissProt) revealed significant homology between the COOH-terminal 215 amino acids of the ASP-deduced amino acid sequence and the antigen 5/antigen 3 family of molecules from Hymenoptera venoms(26.Fang K.S.Y.

The amino-terminal 191 amino acids failed to show significant homology to any proteins in the data base. Because of the apparent homology to hymenopteran venom Ag 5, a polyclonal antiserum against Vesq Ag5 was tested for its ability to recognize secreted and recombinant ASP. As shown in Fig. 3b, Vesq Ag5 antiserum cross-reacted with both the recombinant and native ASP molecules, although recognition was not entirely specific. In addition to ASP, the heterologous serum also recognized a protein of Mr ≈ 28,000 in ES products from activated L3. The antiserum also cross-reacted with rASP, as well as a higher molecular weight protein. However, adsorption of the Vesq Ag5 antiserum with rASP removed all reactivity with the ES products, and decreased binding to rASP by 78%, in addition to abrogating the high Mr reactivity in the rASP lane. The Vesq Ag5 antiserum failed to"

Analogous binding specificity can be engineered into the homologous rat mannose-binding protein A by changing three amino acids and inserting a glycine-rich loop (Iobst, S. T., and Drickamer, K.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 15512-15519). Crystal structures of this mutant complexed with β-methyl galactoside and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) reveal that as with wild-type mannose-binding proteins, the 3- and 4-OH groups of the sugar directly coordinate Ca2⁺ and form hydrogen bonds with amino acids that also serve as Ca2⁺ ligands. The different stereochemistry of the 3- and 4-OH groups in mannose and galactose, combined with a fixed Ca2⁺ coordination geometry, leads to different pyranose ring locations in the two cases. The glycine-rich loop provides selectivity against mannose by holding a critical tryptophan in a position optimal for packing with the apolar face of galactose but incompatible with mannose binding. The 2-acetamido substituent of GalNAc is in the vicinity of amino acid positions identified by site-directed mutagenesis (Iobst, S. T., and Drickamer, K.(1996) J. Biol.

The majority of C-type lectins bind to D-mannose, D-glucose, and related sugars (Man-type ligands), or to D-galactose and its derivatives (Gal-type ligands). The mammalian hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptors, which play a part in serum glycoprotein homeostasis(1.Spiess M.

Cell. 1991; 67: 1029-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), are the best known of the Gal-binding C-type lectins. C-type lectins with high affinity for glycoconjugates bearing terminal galactose residues have also been identified on the surfaces of peritoneal macrophages and Kupffer cells (3.Ii M. Kurata H. Itoh N. Yamashina I. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11295-11298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Hoyle G.W. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

Previous crystallographic analyses of rat mannose-binding proteins (MBPs) A and C have shown that Man-binding C-type lectins recognize their sugar ligands by formation of direct coordination bonds between a Ca2⁺ (designated site 2) and a lone pair of electrons from each of two vicinal hydroxyl groups possessing the same stereochemical arrangement as the equatorial 3- and 4-OH groups of D-mannose(8.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 9.Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The Ca2⁺ is 8-coordinated in a pentagonal bipyramidal arrangement, with the two sugar hydroxyls bisecting one of the apical positions (8.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1a). In addition, the same OH groups form hydrogen bonds with amino acid side chains that are Ca2⁺ site 2 ligands, producing an intimately linked ternary complex of protein, Ca2⁺, and sugar (see Fig. 1a). Only one other contact, an apolar van der Waals contact between a ring carbon and the Cᵦ of residue 189 contributes significantly to binding(8.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 10.Iobst S.T. Wormald M.R. Weis W.I. Dwek R.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15505-15511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with derivatized sugars have shown that free 3- and 4-OH groups are essential for binding to mammalian asialoglycoprotein receptors as well as Man-binding C-type lectins, whereas substitutions at other ring positions have little or no effect on binding(11.Lee R.T. Ichikawa Y. Fay M. Drickamer K. Shao M.-C. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4810-4815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the 3- and 4-OH groups of galactose have an equatorial/axial arrangement, so the mechanism of Gal- and Man-type ligand recognition must be different. Sequence analysis reveals that of the Ca2⁺ 2 ligands, positions equivalent to Glu193, Asn205, and Asp206 of MBP-A are highly conserved among C-type lectins regardless of specificity. In contrast, positions 185 and 187 are found to be Glu and Asn in Man-binding family members, whereas Gal-binding C-type lectins have Gln and Asp at these positions. The Glu185 → Gln/Asn187 → Asp mutant of MBP-A, designated “QPD”, binds to galactose in preference to mannose by a factor of 3 but with relatively low affinity for either sugar(12.Drickamer K.

Position 189 of MBP-A (Fig. 1a) is not conserved among Man-binding C-type lectins but is always either Trp or Phe in Gal-binding family members. Replacement of His189 of MBP-A with Trp in the QPD mutant to make “QPDW” gives a protein with affinity for Gal comparable with natural Gal-binding C-type lectins but that still does not discriminate well between Gal and Man(13.Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, insertion of a glycine-rich loop found in the major form of the rat asialoglycoprotein receptor, rat hepatic lectin-1 (RHL-1), and other Gal-binding C-type lectins that display strong discrimination against mannose results in a mutant (“QPDWG”) with galactose affinity and selectivity comparable with RHL-1(13.Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity for galactose is comparable in QPDW and QPDWG, indicating that the determinants of affinity and selectivity are somewhat distinct. NMR measurements reveal similar modes of galactose binding by QPDWG and RHL-1(13.Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that galactose specificity in C-type lectins is determined by a few residues and can be studied in the well characterized MBP-A background. Here we describe the structure of a trimeric fragment of QPDWG containing the neck and COOH-terminal CRD (14.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), both alone and complexed with β-methyl galactoside (βMeGal) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). The structures reveal the molecular basis of selective galactose recognition by C-type lectins. The structure of the QPDWG-GalNAc complex is consistent with results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments that have identified amino acid positions that contribute to the preferential binding of GalNAc over Gal by certain C-type lectins. Unless otherwise specified, chemicals were obtained from J. T. Baker Inc. LB medium was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Guanidinium hydrochloride and isopropylthiogalactopyranoside were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Clostripain was obtained from Worthington Biochemical. Sepharose 6B, polyethylene glycol 8000, β-methyl galactoside, and N-acetylgalactosamine were from Sigma Divinylsulfone was obtained from Fluka Chemical Co. 2-Methyl-2,4-pentanediol was obtained from Aldrich. The QPDWG mutant of rat MBP-A was expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously(13.Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the amount of isopropylthiogalactopyranoside used to induce expression was 1 mM. The clostripain-treated fragment of QPDWG, cl-QPDWG, was purified as described for wild-type cl-MBP-A(14.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), except that galactose-Sepharose (prepared by the divinylsulfone method (15.Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar)) was used in all affinity chromatography steps. Crystals of cl-QPDWG were grown at 20°C by hanging drop vapor diffusion by mixing equal volumes of 25 mg/ml cl-QPDWG in 10 mM CaCl2/10 mM NaCl and reservior solutions containing 12-15% polyethylene glycol 8000/100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0/20 mM CaCl2/10 mM NaCl/0.02% NaN3 (solution A). Crystals appeared within 3-4 days and grew to full size (typically 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm3) in 7-10 days. Prior to data collection, the crystals were adapted in a stepwise fashion to solution A plus 0, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Complexes with monosaccharides were prepared by including 200 mM βMeGal or GalNAc in the soaking solutions. Crystals were flash-cooled at 100 K, and diffraction data were measured on an R-AXIS II imaging plate detector mounted on a rotating copper anode operating at 4.5 kW. A total of 180° of data were collected in 1.2° oscillation scans from a single orientation and processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK(16.Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Daresbury U.K. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing, 29-30 January 1993. Science and Engineering Research Council Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar). A data set used in the initial stages of the structure determination was obtained to 2.0 Å resolution (Rsym = 4.9%; 88.2% complete). A more complete data set was subsequently measured from another unliganded cl-QPDWG crystal and used in the final stages of refinement (see Table 1 and Table 2).Tabled 1Tabled 1 Crystals of cl-QPDWG are nearly isomorphous with those of wild-type cl-MBP-A and permitted structure solution by rigid body refinement of the wild-type cl-MBP-A model (14.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) against the first cl-QPDWG data set. The side chains of residues 185 and 187, the entire loop from 189 to 198, Ca2⁺, and water molecules were omitted from the model. Temperature factors from the wild-type model were retained. All calculations were performed using X-PLOR(17.Br ü nger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The protomers were refined as individual rigid bodies against data from 10-4 Å and then 10-2.8 Å (R = 0.369). In order to remove model bias, this model was subjected to simulated annealing refinement (18.Brünger A.T. Krukowski A. Erickson J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) starting at 3000 K with 10% of the reflections omitted for calculation of Rfree(19.Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar), followed by positional and isotropic temperature factor refinement against data from 5.0-2.5 Å. Resolution-dependent weights were applied as 1/(1 - 5.5 (1/(2d) - 1/6))2 where d is the Bragg spacing of the reflection. At this point, the glycine-rich loop and the omitted side chains were built using the program O(20.Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Water molecules were added, and positional and temperature factor refinement was carried out against data from 5-2.0 Å. Reflections from 10-2.0 Å were then included and refinement continued. This model was then subject to rigid body refinement against the second data set from 10-2.8 Å, followed by several rounds of positional and isotropic temperature-factor refinement alternating with model adjustment (initially using data from 5-2.0 Å and then extending from 10 Å to the high resolution limit). Sugar complexes were refined by a similar strategy, starting from the same model used for refinement of the unliganded structure against its second data set. The methyl aglycon of βMeGal was not modelled in the most poorly ordered copy. Only the β anomer of GalNAc could be modelled reliably (the ratio of α:β galactose is approximately 1:2 (21.Angyal S.J. Pickles V.A. Aust. J. Chem. 1972; 25: 1695-1710Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar) but has not been reported for GalNAc). An overall anisotropic temperature factor (22.Sheriff S. Hendrickson W.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 118-121Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was applied to each structure, although it significantly reduced the R and Rfree values only for the unliganded QPDWG model. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were not imposed at any point in the refinement. A trimeric fragment of QPDWG containing the neck and COOH-terminal CRD (14.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) was crystallized, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement, both alone and complexed with βMeGal and GalNAc (Table 1 and Table 2). The structures were refined to resolutions of 2.0 Å or better (Table 1 and Table 2). Apart from the His189 → Trp change and the glycine-rich insertion at the carbohydrate-binding site, the structures of wild-type MBP-A and the QPDWG mutant are identical to within the coordinate error. In particular, the Ca2⁺ site 2 ligands of the two structures superimpose, with the side chain amide nitrogen of Gln185 and the carbonyl oxygen of Asp187 of QPDWG in the same positions as the carbonyl oxygen of Glu185 and the amide nitrogen of Asn187 in the wild-type protein. Despite the different stereochemistry of the 3- and 4-OH groups, the mechanism of βMeGal and GalNAc binding to QPDWG is similar to that of Man-type ligands to wild-type MBPs, with the full noncovalent bonding potential of 3- and 4-OH groups used for Ca2⁺ coordination and hydrogen bond formation with Ca2⁺ ligands (8.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 9.Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, a and c). However, maintenance of the pentagonal bipyramidal Ca2⁺ coordination geometry forces the pyranose ring into a very different orientation from that observed in mannose binding to wild-type MBPs(8.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 9.Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The apolar patch formed by the 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbons of βMeGal and GalNAc packs against the side chain of Trp189, an interaction observed in all galactose-lectin interactions studied to date (23.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1c). The angle between the least squares plane through the pyranose ring of galactose and the plane of the Trp189 side indole ring falls within the range found in other galactose-binding lectins (Table 3). This interaction is especially noteworthy given that no aromatic residues interact with the sugar ligand in Man-binding C-type lectins, which in fact make few nonpolar contacts with the sugar ligand(8.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 9.Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Interaction of the Trp189 side chain with the Gly-rich loop is critical to the selectivity of QPDWG for galactose and discrimination against mannose. The loop is a rigid structure with a somewhat unusual conformation (Fig. 2, a and b). His192 tucks into the loop and stabilizes the structure by forming hydrogen bonds with a main chain amide and a carbonyl oxygen; Leu194 is on the outside of the loop and packs against Ala216, thereby holding the loop down against the lower part of the protein (Fig. 2, a and b). The Cα of Gly191 packs against Trp189 and holds it in a slightly unfavorable χ2 rotamer (+60°). Modelling indicates that neither of the most favored χ2 rotamers of Trp (±90°) can be accommodated on the mutant protein, nor can other χ1 rotamers. The Gly-rich loop thus serves as a “doorstop” that prevents Trp189 from adopting a more favorable conformation. Mutagenesis data show that changes in many of the loop residues are tolerated with only small effects on galactose selectivity (13.Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the notion that the loop serves as a rigid unit that restricts the conformation of Trp189 rather than providing specific interactions with the sugar or other residues of the protein. Superposition of mannose bound as observed in a Man6 oligosaccharide-MBP-A complex (8.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a) on QPDWG reveals that the exocyclic C6 clashes with Trp189 (Fig. 2c). Man-type ligands bind to the homologous MBP-C in an orientation reversed 180° from that shown in Fig. 1a, such that the positions 3- and 4-OH groups are exchanged(9.Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and preliminary data indicate that MBP-A can also bind to monosaccharides in this manner. 2S. Park-Snyder and W. I. Weis, unpublished results. In this orientation, the anomeric oxygen in the α configuration sterically clashes with Trp189. Thus, the position of Trp189 imposed by the Gly-rich loop excludes Man-type ligands from the site and explains the essential role of this loop in galactose selectivity. No significant differences in the protein are observed between unliganded and sugar complex structures. The sugar complexes were prepared using sugar concentrations in approximately 100-fold excess over the Kd(13.Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the average temperature factors of the sugar and its liganding residues are quite similar. Thus, the sugars appear to be fully occupied in the binding sites, although the correlation of temperature factor and occupancy at the resolutions used in this study precludes refinement of the sugar occupancy. In two of the three crystallographically independent copies (protomers 1 and 3; Table 2), the glycine-rich loops in both the unliganded and complexed structures have similar temperature factors. The glycine-rich loop of protomer 2 of each structure has consistently higher temperature factors and is most likely a consequence of participating in relatively few lattice contacts. The average temperature factors of the loop in protomer 2 differ by approximately 25 Å2 between the unliganded and complexed structures. It is possible that lattice contacts immobilize the loop so that any effect of sugar binding on loop mobility would be detectable only in the copy with no lattice contacts. However, the entire protomer 2 of the unliganded structure has significantly higher temperature factors than the equivalent protomer in the complexed structures (Table 2), so it cannot be concluded that sugar binding significantly affects the mobility of the binding site region. The QPDWG structures explain binding, mutagenesis, and spectroscopic data obtained from several galactose-binding mutants of MBP-A. Proton NMR spectra of βMeGal in the presence of QPDWG show upfield shifts of the H5, H6, and H6′ protons of Gal consistent with their interaction with the delocalized π electron system of the Trp ring observed in the crystal structure(13.Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The line widths of the aromatic protons of Trp189 are broadened upon Gal binding to QPDW, whereas they are broad in the absence or the presence of Gal in QPDWG, consistent with the notion that the Gly-rich loop immobilizes Trp189 in a position optimal for interaction with Gal(13.Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteoglycan core protein CRDs have Phe instead of Trp at position 189 and exhibit relatively poor selectivity against Man-type ligands. The corresponding MBP-A mutant QPDFG, which includes Phe189, binds to Gal-type ligands only 6-fold more strongly than Man-type ligands, as opposed to the 40-fold selectivity for Gal-type ligands shown by QPDWG (13.Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These properties are explained by exclusion of Man by the 6-membered portion of the Trp189 ring (Fig. 2c), which extends farther out than the side chain of Phe. Several Gal-binding C-type lectins, including RHL-1, display strong preference for GalNAc over Gal, whereas others do not discriminate between these two sugars. An example of the latter is the macrophage galactose receptor (MGR), and the QPDWG mutant of MBP-A mimics MGR in this respect. Site-directed mutagenesis of MGR based on sequence comparisons with the asialoglycoprotein receptors has identified residues in four regions of the sequence that provide selectivity for GalNAc over Gal(24.Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Of these regions, the residue equivalent to Ser154 of MBP-A provides 20-fold of the observed 60-fold selectivity for GalNAc over Gal by RHL-1(24.Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, a histidine equivalent to Thr202 of QPDWG is found in both RHL-1 and MGR and must be present in order to observe the enhancement provided by the residue at 154. The structure of QPDWG complexed with GalNAc shows that the 2-acetamido substituent is in the vicinity of Thr202, which in turn lies near Ser154 (Fig. 3), and is thus consistent with the formation of a GalNAc-specific binding site by residues in these positions in RHL-1. The present structures leave unclear how the Glu185 → Gln/Asn187 → Asp differences lead to specificity for Man- or Gal-type ligands. The residues in the binding sites of wild-type and mutant MBP-A superimpose closely, so it is not obvious why galactosides do not bind to wild-type MBPs in the orientation observed in the present structures. Indeed, free galactose binds to MBP-C through the 1- and 2-OH groups, emphasizing the selectivity of the wild-type site for equatorial OH groups having the same stereochemical arrangement as the 3- and 4-OH of mannose(9.Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These OH groups are related by a 2-fold rotation axis that bisects the pyranose ring and form hydrogen bonds with side chain carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen atoms that conform approximately to this symmetry in the wild-type site but not in the QPD site (Fig. 4). Although the mechanism is not obvious, this difference in symmetry may be related to the weaker affinity of QPD for either Gal- or Man-type ligands(12.Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The absolute affinity of wild-type MBP-A for Man is similar to that of QPDW or QPDWG for Gal, which implies that the binding energy of Man to the wild-type Ca2⁺ site is greater than that of Gal to the QPD mutant site. Thus the favorable interaction with the aromatic residue at position 189 can be viewed as compensating for the loss of symmetry in the mutant site to provide affinity for Gal comparable with that of wild-type MBP-A for Man. In the absence of the glycine-rich loop, mannose is not excluded from the site but interacts with lower affinity due to the asymmetric arrangement of its hydrogen-bonding partners. Another potential source of the different specificities of wild-type and QPD sites is the displacement of ordered water molecules upon sugar binding. High resolution structures of MBP-C show that the 3- and 4-OH of Man-type ligands replace two water molecules that form the same set of hydrogen and Ca2⁺ coordination bonds(9.Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the amount of visible, ordered water structure in the uncomplexed QPDWG site varies among the three crystallographically independent copies, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. In the best ordered site, two water molecules that form hydrogen bonds with the Ca2⁺ 2 ligands at 185, 187, 198, and 210 equivalent to those formed by Gal can be discerned. These water molecules are in approximately the same position as the 3- and 4-OH groups of Gal but only one of them appears to be close enough to Ca2⁺ 2 to form a coordination bond. Only one water molecule is observed in another copy, and no water molecules can be placed with confidence in the third site. Higher resolution structures of the uncomplexed QPDWG site will be required to assess whether or not there is a change in Ca2⁺ coordination number upon ligand binding. The different locations of the bound pyranose ring seen in the present structures and the structures of wild-type MBPs complexed with Man-type ligands are a consequence of Ca2⁺ coordination geometry. This observation and the fact that few other contacts are made with the protein demonstrate the dominant role that Ca2⁺ coordination plays in sugar recognition by C-type lectins. The different pyranose ring locations dictated by Ca2⁺ coordination geometry forms the basis of selective recognition of galactose by steric exclusion of Man-type ligands provided by Trp189 and the glycine-rich loop.

In addition, mutation of the putative LHβ-GSE (TGAAATTGT) eliminated specific DNA binding. To examine the ability of SF-1 to enhance LHβ promoter activity, CV-1 cells, which lack endogenous SF-1, were cotransfected with an SF-1-containing expression vector and an LHβ-luciferase reporter construct. When cotransfected with −209/+5 of the LHβ promoter, SF-1 increased luciferase activity by 56-fold. SF-1 responsiveness was markedly diminished with loss of the putative GSE region in deletion constructs and in the presence of a two base pair mutation, analogous to the mutation which eliminated DNA binding. Finally, the LHβ-GSE was able to confer SF-1 responsiveness on a heterologous minimal growth hormone promoter, GH50 (57-fold).

INTRODUCTIONThe pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, are critical modulators of gamete maturation and gonadal steroidogenesis. These hormones are composed of a common α-subunit linked noncovalently to unique β-subunits which specify physiologic actions(1.Gharib S.D. Wierman M.E. Shupnik M.A. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar).Several DNA regulatory elements have been defined for the α-subunit gene promoter.

Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1767-1773PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of a cAMP response element (CRE) appears to be important for expression in both pituitary and placental cell types, while placental-specific expression occurs through the activation of a trophoblast-specific element acting in concert with the CRE(3.Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Pituitary-specific expression of the α-subunit gene has been attributed to the presence of both a pituitary glycoprotein basal element and a gonadotrope-specific element (GSE)(4.Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Schoderbek W.E. Kim K.E. Ridgway E.C. Mellon P.L. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 893-903PubMed Google Scholar).The consensus GSE sequence (TGACCTTGT), defined in the common α-subunit by Mellon and colleagues, resembles a nuclear receptor binding half-site(4.Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Variations of this sequence, alternatively called the Ad4 response element, are also present in the promoter regions of multiple genes which play a role in steroidogenesis, sexual differentiation, and adult reproductive function(7.Ingraham H.A.

The GSE/Ad4 element has been shown to interact with the transcription factor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), in a number of genes, including the steroidogenic P450, the aromatase, and the Müllerian inhibiting substance genes(8.Rice D.A. Mouw A.R. Bogerd A.M. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 9.Lynch J.P. Lala D.S. Peluso J.J. Luo W. Parker K.L. White B.A. Mol.

Best known for its selective expression in adrenal and gonadal cells, it has more recently been identified in the pituitary gland with localization to the gonadotrope(6.Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 7.Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.-H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar).In studies of the human α-subunit gene promoter, SF-1 has been shown to bind to the GSE region by electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay. Furthermore, reporter constructs which contain the α-subunit GSE site are expressed at higher levels in cell lines which contain endogenous SF-1 than in those cells which lack SF-1, consistent with a role for SF-1 in tissue-specific transcriptional activation of the α-subunit gene(4.Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).In contrast with the α-subunit, the cis-acting elements responsible for expression of either the LHβ- or FSHβ-subunit mRNAs are poorly understood. Interestingly, transgenic mice null for the gene which encodes SF-1 not only express the α-subunit in low levels, but also fail to express the β-subunits, suggesting a functional role for SF-1 in LHβ gene expression(7.Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.-H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). As previous studies of the bovine LHβ gene promoter have shown that the proximal 776 base pairs are sufficient to direct pituitary-specific expression in transgenic mice (11.Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I. Kendall S.K. Wagner T. Yeung J. Gorski J. Nett T.M. Camper S.A. Nilson J.H. Endocrinology. 1994; 8: 1807-1816Google Scholar), we analyzed the corresponding region of the rat LHβ promoter for the presence of an SF-1-binding site, or GSE.The rat LHβ gene promoter contains a consensus GSE at position −127 to −119 relative to the transcriptional start site (Fig. 1). Interestingly, this sequence is highly conserved across species among the LHβ genes, suggesting physiologic significance(11.Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I. Kendall S.K. Wagner T. Yeung J. Gorski J. Nett T.M. Camper S.A. Nilson J.H. Endocrinology. 1994; 8: 1807-1816Google Scholar, 14.Brown P. McNeilly J.R. Wallace R.M. McNeilly A.S. Clark A.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 93: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as the consensus GSE sequence is present in the LHβ gene promoter, we wished to determine whether this putative GSE region has functional significance. We, therefore, investigated the ability of SF-1 to bind to and transactivate the rat LHβ gene promoter.MATERIALS AND METHODSOligonucleotides Used in Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)The nucleotide sequence of the rat LHβ gene promoter was based on Fig. 3 of Jameson et al.(12.Jameson J.L. Chin W.W. Hollenberg A.N. Chang A.S. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15474-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with position −1 assigned to the nucleotide immediately 5′ to the transcriptional start site. The LHSF oligonucleotide used in EMSA corresponds to bases −134 to −113 of the rat LHβ gene (sense strand: 5′-TCCTTTCTGACCTTGTCTGTCT-3′). The LHSFM oligonucleotide sequence is identical to LHSF except for the conversion of the CC nucleotide pair at positions −124 and −123 to an AA pair (sense strand: 5′-TCCTTTCTGAAATTGTCTGTCT-3′). The Pit-1 oligonucleotide used in competition studies corresponds to −137 to −65 of the rat growth hormone promoter and contains two Pit-1/growth hormone factor-1 binding sites (sense strand: 5′-GGGAGGAGCTTCTAAATTATCCATCAGCACAAGCTGTCAGTGGCTCCAGCCATGAATAAATGTATAGGGAAA-3′) (16.Suen C.-S. Chin W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1719-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Except for the Pit-1 oligonucleotide, all oligonucleotides used for EMSA contained 5′-BamHI and 3′-BglII restriction sites in addition to the sequences listed above.Figure 3:Mutation of the putative LHβ-GSE sequence defines nucleotides essential for binding by αT3-1 nuclear extract. Binding reactions included αT3-1 nuclear extracts and either the 32P-labeled wild-type LHβ gene oligonucleotide (LHSF, lanes 1-4) or the 32P-labeled mutated oligonucleotide (LHSFM, lanes 5-8). Competition with 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled LHSF, LHSFM, or Pit-1 oligonucleotide was performed as indicated. The specific and nonspecific binding complexes are indicated by an arrowhead and asterisk, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified over a NICK column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).Nuclear Extract and in Vitro Translated ProteinsThe method of Andrews and Faller (17.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar) was used to prepare crude nuclear extracts from a mouse gonadotrope-derived cell line (αT3-1), a monkey kidney fibroblast cell line (CV-1), and a rat somatolactotrope cell line (GH3). In vitro translated SF-1 protein was generated from a plasmid containing 2.1 kilobase pairs of the mouse SF-1 cDNA using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI)(18.Lala D.S. Rice D.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The resultant product was determined to be of appropriate size by comparison with [35S]methionine-labeled protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssaysNuclear extract (5 μg) or in vitro translated protein (1, 3, or 5 μl) was incubated with 50,000 cpm of oligonucleotide probe in DNA-binding buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) for 30 min on ice. For competition studies, excess unlabeled oligonucleotide was added 5 min prior to the addition of probe. Where indicated, antiserum (1 μl) was added 30 min following the addition of probe, and incubation was continued for 2 h. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer and subjected to autoradiography.Plasmids Used in Transfection StudiesThe largest LHβ reporter construct used for these studies contained 794 base pairs of the 5′-flanking sequence of the rat LHβ gene and the first 5 base pairs of the 5′-untranslated region fused to a luciferase reporter gene, pXP2(19.Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). Deletions in this construct were created by subcloning polymerase chain reaction products containing the LHβ promoter sequences into the pXP2 vector using BamHI/HindIII sites which were introduced by the primers. The −209LHβ-MUT plasmid was created by introducing a two base pair mutation into the −209LHβ construct using the transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, California). The selection primer was located in the pXP2 polylinker and the 3′-end of the LHβ flanking sequence and converted a unique HindIII restriction site to a unique MluI site (sense strand: 5′-GGTAGGGAAGGTATCACGCGTGTCGACCCGGGTACC-3′). The mutagenic primer spanned region −147 to −104 of the LHβ promoter and eliminated a TthIII1 restriction site in addition to introducing the desired mutation (sense strand: 5′-GCTGGTCCCTGGCTTTTCTGAAATTGTCTGTCTCGCCCCCAAAG-3′). To create GSE2-GH50, an oligonucleotide was designed which contained two copies of the putative GSE region as a tandem repeat flanked by BamHI/BglII restriction sites (sense strand: 5′-GATCCTTTTCTGACCTTGTCTGTCTCGCCTCTGACCTTGTCTGTA-3′). This oligonucleotide was inserted upstream of the minimal growth hormone promoter, GH50, in the pXP1 luciferase reporter plasmid(19.Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Suen C.-S. Yen P.M. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1314-1322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All reporter constructs were confirmed by dideoxysequencing.The SF-1 expression vector contained 2.1 kilobase pairs of the mouse SF-1 cDNA driven by cytomegalovirus promoter sequences(18.Lala D.S. Rice D.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The Pit-1 expression vector was created by placing 915 base pairs of the rat Pit-1/growth hormone factor-1 cDNA sequence from pBluescript SK(-) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) into the pcDNAI vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) using HindIII/NotI restriction enzyme sites(21.Bodner M. Castrillo J.-L. Theill L.E. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and AssaysMonkey kidney fibroblast (CV-1) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells growing in 3.5-cm tissue culture wells (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA) were transfected with expression (0.1 μg/well) and reporter (1.65 μg/well) plasmids using the calcium phosphate precipitation method(22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Control wells received the appropriate “empty” expression vector (0.1 μg/well). Cotransfection with an RSV-β-galactosidase plasmid (1 μg/well) allowed correction for differences in transfection efficiency between wells. The cells were harvested 48 h following transfection and the cell extracts analyzed for both luciferase (23.DeWet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase (24.Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) activities. Luciferase activity was first normalized to the level of β-galactosidase activity. Results were then calculated as fold change relative to expression in the presence of the control empty expression vector. Data are shown as the mean ± S.E. and represent a minimum of three independent experiments with each point run in triplicate in each experiment.Sources of SF-1 and Pit-1 Antibodies and PlasmidsThe rabbit SF-1 antiserum as well as the vectors containing the SF-1 cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. K. L. Parker (Duke University). The SF-1 antibody was generated against a glutathione S-transferase-SF-1 fusion protein(25.Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim E. Moisan M.-P. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Pit-1 antiserum, directed against amino acids 136-150 of rat Pit-1/growth hormone factor-1, was provided by C. Bancroft (Mt. Sinai School of Medicine) (26.Morris A.E. Jiang Y. McChesney R.E. Jackson A.E. Bancroft C. Chasin L.A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 94: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The Pit-1 cDNA in pBluescript SK(-) was provided by Dr. L. E. Theill (University of California, San Diego).RESULTSαT3-1 Nuclear Extract Binds to the Putative GSE Region of the LHβ Gene PromoterThe αT3-1 cell line has previously been shown to express both SF-1 mRNA and protein(6.Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 7.Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.-H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from this cell line, presumed to contain SF-1, have been shown to bind to the α-subunit promoter GSE(4.Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We therefore utilized EMSA to investigate whether these extracts were able to interact with the region of the rat LHβ gene promoter that contains the putative GSE sequence (oligonucleotide LHSF). As shown in Fig. 2, the interaction of αT3-1 nuclear extracts with 32P-labeled LHSF produced a specific protein-DNA complex as demonstrated by successful competition with unlabeled LHSF (lanes 1 and 2).Figure 2:αT3-1 nuclear extracts and in vitro translated SF-1 bind the putative LHβ-GSE region with similar specificity. Binding reactions included 32P-labeled LHSF as a probe and, as indicated, either αT3-1 nuclear extract (lanes 1-4) or 1, 3, or 5 μl of in vitro translated SF-1 (lanes 5-11). Competition with 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled LHSF is shown for both the nuclear extract and in vitro translated SF-1 (lanes 2 and 8). Incubation with antiserum specific to SF-1 (lanes 3 and 9) or Pit-1 (lanes 4 and 10) was also performed using both protein preparations. Note that 3 μl of in vitro translated SF-1 were used in the cold competition and antibody studies (lanes 8-10) and therefore band intensity should be compared against lane 6. Lane 11 contains a probe and the unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate used for in vitro translation. The arrowhead indicates the specific binding complex. A nonspecific band, indicated by the asterisk, is present in unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In order to confirm that the complex identified in Fig. 2 contained SF-1, we investigated the effect of a SF-1-specific antibody on the formation of the αT3-1 nuclear extract-LHSF complex. This antibody has previously been shown to block the ability of SF-1 to bind to the promoter element of a number of genes, including the glycoprotein hormone α-subunit, aromatase, and 21-hydroxylase genes(6.Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9.Lynch J.P. Lala D.S. Peluso J.J. Luo W. Parker K.L. White B.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 776-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 25.Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim E. Moisan M.-P. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with this SF-1-specific antiserum substantially decreased the intensity of the protein-DNA complex while the addition of an anti-Pit-1 antiserum, used as a negative control, had no effect (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). This result confirms that the GSE of the LHβ gene promoter is bound by SF-1, or an immunologically related protein, present in αT3-1 nuclear extracts.Parallel EMSA was performed using the oligonucleotide LHSF as a probe in the presence of nuclear extracts from cell lines that do not contain SF-1. No specific protein-DNA interactions were detected with the use of nuclear extracts from either monkey kidney fibroblast cells (CV-1) or rat somatolactotrope cells (GH3) (data not shown).In Vitro Translated SF-1 Binds to the LHβ Gene PromoterFurther confirmation that SF-1 binds to the LHβ-GSE promoter region was obtained by the use of in vitro translated SF-1 in EMSA. A binding reaction containing the labeled LHSF oligonucleotide and in vitro translated SF-1 resulted in a protein-DNA complex mobility similar to that obtained with the αT3-1 nuclear extracts (Fig. 2, lanes 5-10). Formation of this complex diminished in the presence of either excess unlabeled LHSF oligonucleotide or blocking antiserum directed against SF-1, but was unaffected by the Pit-1 antibody. Taken as a whole, these data clearly demonstrate that the putative GSE region of the LHβ gene is recognized by SF-1, as either an endogenous (αT3-1 nuclear extract) or an in vitro translated product.Mutation of the Putative LHβ-GSE Site Eliminates BindingIn order to localize further the SF-1 recognition site, a 2-base pair mutation was introduced in the wild-type LHβ oligonucleotide sequence (LHSF) to form LHSFM. The choice of this mutation was based on the loss of DNA binding which resulted from analogous mutations in the Müllerian inhibiting substance and glycoprotein α-subunit promoters(6.Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 10.Shen W.-H. Moore C.C.D. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed using αT3-1 nuclear extracts and either the wild-type LHSF (Fig. 3, lanes 1-4) or the mutant LHSFM (Fig. 3, lanes 5-8) as a probe. The intensity of the complex obtained with the LHSF probe was blunted by unlabeled wild-type LHSF, but not by the mutated sequence or by an unrelated oligonucleotide containing two binding sites for the pituitary transcription factor, Pit-1 (Fig. 3, lanes 2-4). As seen in lanes 5-8, the αT3-1 nuclear extract was not able to bind to LHSFM when used as a probe. These results establish that an intact LHβ-GSE sequence is required for binding by αT3-1 nuclear extract.SF-1 Specifically Increases LHβ Promoter ActivityWe next sought to determine the functional significance of the interaction between SF-1 and the LHβ gene promoter sequences. In initial investigations utilizing the gonadotrope-derived αT3-1 cell line, LHβ promoter-driven luciferase activity exceeded luciferase activity in the absence of cell extract (background activity) by less than 2-fold. At this level of expression, we were unable to evaluate reliably whether the presence or absence of the putative GSE sequence altered LHβ promoter activity in response to the endogenous SF-1 present in this cell line. Furthermore, attempts to increase LHβ gene expression through cotransfection with an SF-1 expression vector were unsuccessful.These studies were therefore performed in the monkey kidney fibroblast cell line, CV-1, a cell line which has previously been shown to support SF-1-induced transactivation of the bovine P-450 CYP11B promoter. By Northern blot analysis, this cell line lacks the mRNA which encodes the SF-1 homolog, Ad4BP(27.Honda S. Morohashi K. Nomura M. Takeya H. Kitajima M. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7494-7502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As stated previously, we have also demonstrated that CV-1 nuclear extract fails to bind the LHβ-GSE region by EMSA, consistent with the absence of endogenous SF-1 (data not shown). Utilizing the CV-1 cell line, basal LHβ gene promoter activity exceeded expression of the promoterless reporter plasmid (pXP2) by an average of 15-fold.In Fig. 4A, CV-1 cells were cotransfected with region −209 to +5 of the LHβ gene promoter and cytomegalovirus-driven expression vectors containing either the SF-1 or Pit-1 cDNA. The presence of SF-1 markedly increased LHβ promoter activity (56 ± 5-fold). In contrast, the pituitary transcription factor Pit-1 did not alter luciferase levels, indicating the specificity of the SF-1 response.Figure 4:An intact putative LHβ-GSE region confers SF-1 responsiveness to both the LHβ promoter and a heterologous minimal promoter. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter constructs which contained various regions of the rat LHβ gene promoter. Cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding either SF-1 or Pit-1 and with an RSV-β-galactosidase expression vector. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Promoter activity was then calculated as fold change over expression in the presence of the appropriate control expression vector. Results are shown as the mean ± S.E. of at least nine samples in three independent experiments. A, comparison of LHβ promoter activity in response to SF-1 versus Pit-1. B, SF-1 stimulation of LHβ promoter activity with loss of the intact GSE sequence by sequential 5′-deletion or mutagenesis. C, SF-1 responsiveness of the growth hormone minimal promoter (GH50) (20.Suen C.-S. Yen P.M. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1314-1322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or GH50 preceded by two copies of the putative LHβ-GSE region (GSE2-GH50).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Of importance, we have recently confirmed the ability of SF-1 to increase LHβ promoter activity in the rat pituitary-derived somatolactotrope cell line, GH3. Utilizing transiently transfected GH3 cells and conditions similar to those in CV-1 cells, SF-1 increased LHβ promoter activity in the −209/+5 construct by 15 ± 1.5-fold.SF-1 Stimulation of Rat LHβ Gene Promoter Activity Is Dependent on the Presence of an Intact GSEIn order to delineate the region in the LHβ gene promoter responsible for providing SF-1 responsiveness, reporter constructs were generated which incorporated various deletions in the rat LHβ gene promoter. Of note, no systematic changes in basal expression (i.e. in the absence of SF-1) were observed in these deletion constructs.The evaluation of sequential 5′-deletion constructs revealed persistent SF-1 stimulation of LHβ promoter activity with deletion to position −134, followed by an abrupt loss of the SF-1 response with deletion to position −82 (Fig. 4B). Based on these data, loss of LHβ promoter sequences across the putative GSE region (positions −127 to −119) correlates with the loss of SF-1-stimulated promoter activity.Further definition of the SF-1-responsive cis-acting element was obtained by the introduction of a two base pair mutation into the putative GSE site of the −209LHβ luciferase reporter construct to form −209LHβ-MUT. This small change, analogous to the mutation which eliminated DNA-binding by nuclear extract (Fig. 3), substantially decreased the ability of SF-1 to increase promoter activity (6 ± 1-fold versus 56 ± 5-fold) (Fig. 4B). Thus, transactivation of the LHβ promoter by SF-1 appears to be critically dependent on the presence of an intact GSE sequence.LHβ Promoter Sequences Confer SF-1 Responsiveness to a Heterologous PromoterHaving demonstrated that the putative GSE site is necessary for SF-1 responsiveness in the context of the LHβ gene promoter, we next asked whether this sequence was sufficient to confer SF-1 responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. Two copies of the LHβ-GSE sequence were inserted upstream of the growth hormone minimal promoter, GH50. As seen in Fig. 4C, these sequences conferred a marked SF-1 response to this normally nonresponsive promoter (57 ± 10-fold versus 1.3 ± 0.2-fold).Other investigators have shown previously that the human α-subunit promoter GSE (identical to the putative rat LHβ-GSE, see Fig. 1) increases thymidine kinase minimal promoter activity in SF-1 containing cell lines, but not in cell lines which lack SF-1(6.Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, interpretation of this study was limited by the possibility that additional cell-specific factors were contributing to the observed differences in transcriptional activity. As our results were obtained in a single cell line, stimulation of promoter activity in the presence of the GSE can be attributed solely to SF-1-induced effects.DISCUSSIONOur results clearly demonstrate that SF-1 bi"

All mutated proteins were retained on dATP-Sepharose, indicating that the mutant proteins had intact allosteric sites.

They catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotides to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides by radical chemistry. Three different reductases have been found in Escherichia coli, one functional during aerobic growth (for a recent review, see Sjöberg(19.Sjöberg B.-M. Structure. 1994; 2: 793-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) and one during anaerobic growth (Reichard, 17.Reichard P. J. Biol.

The organic radical is oxygen-sensitive, and exposure of the radical-containing enzyme to air leads to truncation at Gly-681 (King and Reichard, 12.King D.S. Reichard P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), accompanied by inactivation (Sun et al., 1993). There is a striking amino acid sequence similarity between a stretch of 5 residues comprising glycine 681 in the anaerobic reductase (Sun et al., 1993) or glycine 580 in the corresponding bacteriophage T4 anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (Young et al., 24.Young P.

Formation of an oxygen-sensitive radical at Gly-734 in PFL and oxygen-dependent truncation of PFL at this position are analogous reactions to the ones described above for the anaerobic reductase. Glycine 681 in the anaerobic reductase was therefore proposed to be the position of the free radical in this system (Sun et al., 1993). In agreement with this proposition, the EPR spectrum of the radical of the anaerobic reductase shares some common features with that of the glycyl radical of PFL, in particular the large dominant doublet hyperfine splitting (Mulliez et al., 1993). pyruvate formate-lyase polymerase chain reaction. In this study, the chemical nature of the free radical of the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase has been investigated by isotopic substitution experiments. The effects of isotopically labeling the glycines of the enzyme on the hyperfine structure of the characteristic EPR spectrum were consistent with the organic radical being on a glycine residue. Moreover we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify the location of the glycyl radical. In addition to the mutation G681A, the adjacent mutations C680S and Y682F were also constructed. Mutant proteins were characterized with regard to the presence of iron-sulfur cluster, glycyl radical, and enzyme activity. Taken together our results demonstrate that the free radical of anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase is located on glycine 681. In a similar study, the stable glycyl radical of the T4 anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase was localized to position 580 in this enzyme. 2P. Young, J. Andersson, M. Sahlin, and B.-M.

Plasmid pAE183 was described by Eliasson et al.(7.Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used for mutagenesis were (mismatches underlined): G681A, 5′-GC GTG TGC GCA TAT TTA GGT AGC C-3′; C680S1, 5′-C CGC GTG TCC GGA TAT TTA GG-3′; and its reverse primer C680S2, 5′-CC TAA ATA TCC GGA CAC GCG G-3′; Y682F1, 5′-GTG TGC GGA TTT TTA GGT AGC C-3′; and its reverse primer Y682F2, 5′-G GCT ACC TAA AAA TCC GCA CAC-3′. The G681A mutation was introduced into plasmid pAE183 using the Bio-Rad muta-gene phagemid mutagenesis kit. Mutations C680S and Y682F were separately introduced into plasmid pRSS by PCR overlap extension as described by Higuchi(10.Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar). All mutations were then recloned into the pDA plasmid. E. coli strain JM109(DE3) containing wild type or mutant plasmid pDA was grown anaerobically at 37°C in LB medium with 2 g/liter glucose and 200 μg/ml ampicillin. When the A640 of the culture was 0.3, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mM. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 2 h after induction and stored in liquid nitrogen. Isotopic labeling of the reductase was achieved by anaerobically growing E. coli strain JM109(DE3) cells containing plasmid pREH at 37°C in minimal medium supplemented with 6 g/liter glucose, 200 μg/ml ampicillin, 7% LB medium, 2 mM MgSO4, 4 μg/ml thiamin, and 6 mM labeled glycine. After 16 h of growth, cells were harvested and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min and stored in liquid nitrogen. A small amount of LB medium was required to accelerate the growth rate. This additive provided a negligible amount of unlabeled glycine. A very high level of protein expression was obtained, as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but the majority of the recombinant protein produced by cells grown in synthetic medium resided in the insoluble portion of the cell extract, presumably as inclusion bodies, from which soluble reductase was extracted. Protein-bound iron was determined colorimetrically with bathophenanthroline after acid denaturation of protein (Beinert, 2.Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Optical spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer (lambda 2) UV-visible spectrophotometer. The anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase was purified as described in Eliasson et al.(1992), with modifications according to Mulliez et al.(1995). Prior to enzyme activity measurements the reductase was preincubated anaerobically at room temperature for 60 min with the components required for the activation step. Typically, the 35-μl premixture contained 1-5 μg of anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase, 0.4 mM AdoMet, 1 mM NADPH, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 30 mM KCl, 30 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mM sodium formate, 2 μg of flavodoxin reductase (Bianchi et al., 1993a), and 1 μg of flavodoxin (Bianchi et al., 1993b). The actual reduction reaction was started by adding 15 μl of anaerobic substrate mixture (3.3 mM [3H]CTP, 3.3 mM ATP, and 33 mM MgCl2 (Harder et al., 9.Harder J. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Ballinger M.D. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25548-25552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and was stopped after 20 min by exposure of the reaction mixture to oxygen. The amount of dCTP formed was determined as described previously (Eliasson et al., 1992). One unit of activity corresponds to the reduction of 1 nmol of CTP/min at 25°C. Specific activity is defined as units per mg of protein. In order to measure the glycyl radical content, purified wild type, labeled, or mutant proteins were activated anaerobically. All the components were degassed with argon for 1 h prior to use. The activation was carried out by mixing degassed components in EPR tubes and incubating the mixtures at room temperature for 1 h. Normally, 200 μl of activation mixture contained 25-30 μM reductase, 1.5 mM AdoMet, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM sodium formate, 80 μg of flavodoxin reductase, 20 μg of flavodoxin, 20 μg of NrdG protein (Sun et al., 1995), 5 mM NADPH, 45 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 45 mM KCl. The contents of the EPR tubes were frozen anaerobically in liquid nitrogen after activation. The specific activities of isotopically labeled enzyme preparations were significantly lower than that of the wild type reductase (500 and 200 nmol/mg of protein/min, respectively, compared with 1000 nmol/mg of protein/min for the wild type enzyme), in all probability because of their origin from inclusion bodies. First derivative spectra were recorded at 77 or 100 K with a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer operating at X band and using the Bruker variable temperature device ER4411 VT or a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instrument helium flow cryostat. Samples of 0.2 ml were introduced into quartz tubes under argon and sealed with a rubber septum. In order to apply EPR spectroscopy to whole cells, E. coli cell cultures were centrifuged, and cell pellets were transferred to an anaerobic box and then resuspended in culture medium to be introduced into an EPR tube. After 20 min of centrifugation at 1000 rpm, the supernatant was eliminated, and packed cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Quantitation of the glycyl free radical was based on comparisons of the double integral of the EPR spectra with that of a standard 1 mM Cu2+ (in 1.2 M NaClO4, pH 1.8) solution. This was used for quantitation of a standard anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase glycyl radical-containing sample. The standard reductase sample was kept at 77 K and used as a secondary standard for quantitation of other samples with an identical EPR line shape. The E. coli anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase gene, nrdD, has previously been cloned in different plasmids for overproduction of the enzyme. The downstream nrdG gene encodes a 17.5-kDa protein, which is essential for activation of the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (Sun et al., 1995). Only the enzyme purified from constructs containing both nrdD and nrdG genes is active, and plasmid pREH (Sun et al., 1995), used for the isotopic labeling experiments, is one such plasmid. In this study, we also constructed plasmid pDA containing both nrdD and nrdG genes. Bacteria carrying plasmid pDA with a wild type or mutant nrdD gene gave good overexpression; extracts contained 6-12% anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (data not shown). From cells carrying pREH and grown anaerobically in minimal medium in the presence of isotopically labeled glycine we prepared [13C]- or [2H]glycine-substituted enzyme. Fig. 1 shows the EPR spectra of the native and the two isotopically labeled reductases. The main feature of the EPR spectrum of the unlabeled enzyme (spectrum A) is a large doublet splitting (14-15 G) centered at g = 2.0033. This splitting was originally assigned to hyperfine coupling of the unpaired electron spin to a hydrogen nucleus (Mulliez et al., 1993). The effects of labeling the glycine residues of the reductase on the EPR signal now directly prove that the radical is centered at C-2 of a glycine residue. The EPR features of the [2-13C]glycine-containing enzyme clearly reflect strong coupling of the unpaired electron to the 13C (I = 1/2) nucleus (spectrum B). Moreover, the presence of a singlet signal in the [2H]glycine-substituted enzyme unambiguously demonstrates that the 14 G doublet splitting in the wild type enzyme originates from the hyperfine coupling of the unpaired electron spin to the α-hydrogen of the glycyl radical center (spectrum C). Spectrum B proved to be difficult to simulate, and further studies are required to find out the correct g and A tensors describing the radical. However, from the outermost lines of the signal, it is possible to obtain a value for the hyperfine 13C coupling constant Az in the 46-50 G range. Moreover, the Ax and Ay components of this tensor seem to be in the 0-5 G range. Such small values are in good agreement with 13C Ax,y constants obtained for radicals of related model compounds (Sinclair and Codella, 18.Sinclair J. Codella P. J. Chem. Phys. 1973; 59: 1569-1576Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or for other π-type radicals. As a consequence, Aiso, the isotropic 13C coupling constant should be in the 15-21 G range. The glycyl radical of PFL has the same coupling characteristics with a large 1H hyperfine splitting (15 G) and an estimated Aiso hyperfine coupling constant also in the range of 16-21 G. A theoretical model study of a dipeptide analog of a glycine radical demonstrated that only planar or nearly planar conformations are energetically accessible due to π-electron delocalization. The hyperfine couplings computed for these conformations (Barone et al., 1.Barone V. Adamo C. Grand A. Brunel Y. Fontecave M. Subra R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 1083-1089Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) are in excellent agreement with the experimental values for both glycyl radicals. On the other hand, it is possible to distinguish between the glycyl radicals of the anaerobic reductase and PFL. First, over a 24-h incubation period (Mulliez et al., 1993) 3E. Mulliez, unpublished data. the reductase radical does not exchange its Hα atom, responsible for the doublet splitting, with the solvent, whereas the PFL radical exchanges rapidly under these conditions. Second, the EPR spectrum of the PFL radical is more complex, with partially resolved subdoublet splitting, arising from two nonexchangeable protons (Wagner et al., 1992). The EPR signal of the glycyl free radical also can be recorded directly in bacterial pellets from E. coli JM109(DE3)/pREH cells induced for overexpressing the reductase. The EPR spectra of cells grown in minimal medium in the presence of normal or labeled glycine gave EPR spectra identical to those of the corresponding pure enzyme. This shows that the reductase exists in the radical form within anaerobic cells and that its concentration is such that the endogenous PFL signal is not detectable. On the other hand, in plasmid-free cells only the background glycyl radical signal typical of PFL (Knappe and Sawers, 13.Knappe J. Sawers G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 75: 383-398Google Scholar) was observed. To map the site of the glycyl radical we mutated Gly-681 in the nrdD gene and used mutations in the adjacent residues, Cys-680 and Tyr-682, as controls. All three mutant proteins (C680S, G681A, and Y682F) behaved like wild type anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase during the purification. An important observation was that all three mutant proteins were retained by dATP-Sepharose chromatography, indicating the presence of intact allosteric binding sites. Moreover, the purified mutant proteins migrated like wild type protein during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see below), indicating that all preparations contained full-length polypeptides. The iron-sulfur center of the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase is essential for enzyme activity, which was found to correlate linearly with the iron content of the protein (Mulliez et al., 1993). The iron content of the protein preparations purified from the mutants varied between 1.1 and 1.3 atoms of iron/protein dimer (Table 1). These values are similar to the iron content of wild type protein preparations from JM109(DE3)/pDA cells, which is typically between 1.2 and 1.5 iron atoms. The presence of intact iron-sulfur centers in the preparations from the mutants was verified by UV-visible spectroscopy. Fig. 2 shows that mutant and wild type preparations display a spectrum between 300 and 600 nm, characteristic of iron-sulfur proteins. The small difference between the spectra in the region between 300 and 350 nm is not considered to be significant. The absorption coefficients at 420 nm for the mutant proteins are similar and compare well with those published for the active enzyme prepared from plasmid pEH10 (Mulliez et al., 1993).Tabled 1Figure 2:UV-visible absorption spectra of wild type and mutant anaerobic ribonucleotide reductases. A, native protein; B, G681A; C, C680S; D, Y682F. The enzymes were in 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM sodium formate, and 1 mM ATP. For clarity the different traces have been offset by 0.05 absorbance unit relative to each other.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) If the catalytically essential radical of anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase is located at glycine 681, we would expect the mutant G681A to be devoid of both radical and enzyme activity. Fig. 3 shows the EPR signals recorded from the activated proteins. With the exception of the G681A, which completely lacked a radical EPR signal, all the other proteins showed the typical glycyl radical signal. We also quantified the amount of radical (Table 1). In the wild type protein the radical content is between 0.43 and 0.49 radical/reductase enzyme. The mutant protein C680S has about 20% radical and Y682F has about 12% radical/reductase, compared with the wild type protein (Table 1). Since all purified enzymes contained substantial amounts of truncated polypeptides (see below), the actual radical content per full-length protein might be significantly higher. The EPR signal of the glycyl radical also can be recorded directly in bacterial pellets from induced JM109(DE3)/pDA cells, thereby avoiding extensive purification protocols, which may affect the recovery of the radical. Whereas cells carrying the wild type plasmid gave the glycyl radical signal typical of anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase, cells carrying the G681A plasmid only showed the glycyl radical signal from PFL (data not shown), as expected if the induced mutant anaerobic reductase lacks a glycyl radical. In this case, washing of the cell pellet with anaerobic D2O resulted in reduced line width of the EPR spectrum (data not shown), in agreement with the solvent exchangeability of the proton responsible for the dominating doublet hyperfine splitting of the PFL radical. Enzyme activities of the pure wild type and mutant reductases are shown in Table 1. The G681A mutant protein completely lacked enzyme activity, whereas the C680S protein had about 14% activity and the Y682F protein about 7% as compared with the wild type protein. Taken together, these results clearly show that the G681A mutant protein lacks both radical and enzyme activity, whereas the C680S and Y682F mutant proteins still retain some radical and some enzyme activity. The difference between radical content and corresponding enzyme activity of the mutants C680S and Y682F might be caused by experimental variation or by conformational changes introduced by the mutations that influence the enzyme activity and the generation of radical differently. What are the functions of Cys-680 and Tyr-682? Our results indicate that their presence influences the surroundings of the radical-harboring Gly-681 residue but that neither is essential for formation of the glycyl radical or for activity of the anaerobic reductase. The mutation C680S generates the sequence RVSGY between residues 678 and 682, which in fact is identical to the corresponding sequence surrounding the glycyl radical of PFL (Frey et al., 8.Frey M. Rothe M. Wagner A.F.V. Knappe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12432-12437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Sun et al., 1993). In reciprocal experiments in the PFL system, substitution of Ser by Cys in the active site oligopeptide RVSGYLG led to loss of substrate efficiency (Frey et al., 1994), whereas substitution of Ser by Ala in PFL proper gave an enzyme with 34% residual activity (Frey et al., 1994). 4S. Elbert and J. Knappe, unpublished results. In addition, substitution of Tyr by Phe in the PFL active site oligopeptide only led to partial loss of substrate efficiency. Thus, mutations of the residues adjacent to the essential glycine residue are tolerated to some extent both by the anaerobic reductase and by PFL. Our results clearly demonstrate that the presence of Gly-681 is essential for generation of a glycyl radical and concomitant enzyme activity in the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase, whereas mutations of the adjacent residues result in proteins that still can harbor a glycyl radical and retain some enzymatic activity. Together with the isotope substitution experiments these results demonstrate that the location of the glycyl radical-harboring residue in E. coli anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase is at position 681."

Transduction of cultured Hepa (mouse hepatoma) cells and LDLR-deficient CHO-ldlA7 cells in vitro by the virus led to high-level expression of immunoreactive VLDLR proteins with molecular sizes of 143 kDa and 161 kDa. Digestion of the cell extract with the enzymes neuraminidase, N-glycanase, and O-glycanase resulted in the stepwise lowering of the apparent size of the 161-kDa species toward the 143-kDa species. LDLR (-/-) mice fed a 0.2% cholesterol diet were treated with a single intravenous injection of 3 × 109 plaque-forming units of AdmVLDLR. Control LDLR (-/-) mice received either phosphate-buffered saline or AdLacZ, a similar adenovirus containing the LacZ cDNA instead of mVLDLR cDNA. Comparison of the plasma lipids in the 3 groups of mice indicates that in the AdmVLDL animals, total cholesterol is reduced by ~50% at days 4 and 9 and returned toward control values on day 21. In these animals, there was also a ~30% reduction in plasma apolipoprotein (apo) E accompanied by a 90% fall in apoB-100 on day 4 of treatment. By FPLC analysis, the major reduction in plasma cholesterol in the AdmVLDLR animals was accounted for by a marked reduction in the intermediate density lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein (IDL/LDL) fraction. Plasma VLDL, IDL/LDL, and HDL were isolated from the three groups of animals by ultracentrifugal flotation. In the AdmVLDLR animals, there was substantial loss (~65%) of protein and cholesterol mainly in the IDL/LDL fraction on days 4 and 9. Nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis indicates a preferential loss of the IDL peak although the LDL peak was also reduced. When 125I-IDL was administered intravenously into animals on day 4, the AdmVLDLR animals cleared the 125I-IDL at a rate 5-10 times higher than the AdLacZ animals.We conclude that adenovirus-mediated transfer of the VLDLR gene induces high-level hepatic expression of the VLDLR and results in a reversal of the hypercholesterolemia in 0.2% cholesterol diet-fed LDLR (-/-, mice.

https://openalex.org/W2156231661,"We used site-directed mutagenesis of rabbit muscle aldolase, falling ball viscometry, co-sedimentation binding assays, and negative stain electron microscopy, to identify specific residues involved in the aldolase-actin interaction. Three mutants, R42A (Arg → Ala), K107A (Lys → Ala), and R148A (Arg → Ala), had minimal actin binding activity relative to wild type (wt) aldolase, and one mutant, K229A (Lys → Ala), had intermediate actin binding activity. A mutant with ~4,000-fold reduced catalytic activity, D33S (Asp → Ser), had normal actin binding activity. The aldolase substrates and product, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, fructose 1-phosphate, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, reversed the gelling of wt aldolase and F-actin, consistent with at least partial overlap of catalytic and actin-binding sites on aldolase. Molecular modeling reveals that the actin-binding residues we have identified are clustered in or around the catalytic pocket of the molecule. These data confirm that the aldolase-actin interaction is due to specific binding, and they suggest that electrostatic interactions between specific residues, rather than net charge, mediate this interaction. Low concentration of wt and D33S aldolase caused formation of high viscosity actin gel networks, while high concentrations of wt and D33S aldolase resulted in solation of the gel by bundling actin filaments, consistent with a potential role for this enzyme in the regulation of cytoplasmic structure. We used site-directed mutagenesis of rabbit muscle aldolase, falling ball viscometry, co-sedimentation binding assays, and negative stain electron microscopy, to identify specific residues involved in the aldolase-actin interaction. Three mutants, R42A (Arg → Ala), K107A (Lys → Ala), and R148A (Arg → Ala), had minimal actin binding activity relative to wild type (wt) aldolase, and one mutant, K229A (Lys → Ala), had intermediate actin binding activity. A mutant with ~4,000-fold reduced catalytic activity, D33S (Asp → Ser), had normal actin binding activity. The aldolase substrates and product, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, fructose 1-phosphate, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, reversed the gelling of wt aldolase and F-actin, consistent with at least partial overlap of catalytic and actin-binding sites on aldolase. Molecular modeling reveals that the actin-binding residues we have identified are clustered in or around the catalytic pocket of the molecule. These data confirm that the aldolase-actin interaction is due to specific binding, and they suggest that electrostatic interactions between specific residues, rather than net charge, mediate this interaction. Low concentration of wt and D33S aldolase caused formation of high viscosity actin gel networks, while high concentrations of wt and D33S aldolase resulted in solation of the gel by bundling actin filaments, consistent with a potential role for this enzyme in the regulation of cytoplasmic structure. Most intermediary metabolism is catalyzed by enzymes that are not known to be associated with a discrete organelle or complex, such as the mitochondrion or fatty acid synthase complex. Because of this, metabolic pathways are generally treated as though they exist as a series of diffusion-limited reactions in the aqueous phase of cytoplasm (1.Stryer L. Biochemistry. 4th Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1995: 181-206Google Scholar). While this assumption simplifies conceptualization and modeling of metabolism, there is substantial evidence that it is oversimplified, and perhaps incorrect, in at least some cases. Hypotheses involving elegant alternative organizational schemes for cellular biochemistry have been proposed over the years(2.Wilson E.B. The Cell in Development and Heredity. 3rd Ed.

A Guided Tour of the Living Cell. Scientific American Books, Inc., New York1984: 17Google Scholar). These are important hypotheses to test, due to their far-reaching implications for cytoplasmic structure and for metabolic regulation. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that may be organized around the cytoskeleton, rather than in a membrane-bound compartment(14.Clarke F.M. Stephan P. Morton D.J. Wiedemann J. Beitner R. Regulation of Carbohydrate Metabolism. 2. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1986: 1-35Google Scholar). It has been known for many years that several glycolytic enzymes can interact with cytoskeletal proteins (15.Arnold H. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 6: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and it has been proposed that some glycolytic enzymes may play structural and/or regulatory roles in cytoplasm, in addition to their catalytic roles(16.Clarke F.M. Morton D.J. Stephan P. Wiedemann J. Cell Motility: Mechanism and Regulation. University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo1985: 235-250Google Scholar). Aldolase has one of the highest bound fractions to myofibrils, stress fibers, and F-actin among the glycolytic enzymes(15.Arnold H. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 6: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 16.Clarke F.M. Morton D.J. Stephan P. Wiedemann J. Cell Motility: Mechanism and Regulation.

In fact, aldolase was one of the first actin-binding proteins identified(20.Pette D. Brandau H. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1962; 9: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21.Bauer A.C. Pette D. Roisen F. Amberson W.R. Fed. Proc. 1964; 23: 310Google Scholar). There are multiple binding sites on one aldolase tetramer, demonstrated by its ability to cross-link F-actin into a gel(16.Clarke F.M. Morton D.J. Stephan P. Wiedemann J. Cell Motility: Mechanism and Regulation. University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo1985: 235-250Google Scholar, 22.Walsh T.P. Winzor D.J. Clarke F.M. Masters C.J. Morton D.J. Biochem.

Both disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D and inhibition of glycolytic flux with 2-deoxyglucose result in rapid, reversible release of bound aldolase in 3T3 cells, consistent with physiologically relevant cytoskeletal binding of aldolase in vivo(26.Pagliaro L.

Several methods have been used in studies aimed at localizing the F-actin binding and catalytic sites on aldolase. Proteolytic cleavage and chemical modification studies indicated spatial separation of substrate and actin-binding sites on aldolase(27.Humphreys L. Reid S. Masters C. Int. J. Biochem. 1986; 18: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28.Don M. Masters C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 81: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies have shown that actin filaments can modify the catalytic parameters of aldolase (24.Arnold H. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25.Walsh T.P. Clarke F.M. Masters C.J. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and that myofibrils can competitively inhibit FBP cleavage by aldolase(29.Harris S.J. Winzor D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). More recently, a region of the aldolase molecule bearing sequence similarity to the actin-binding site on actin and actin-binding proteins was identified between residues 33 and 45 of aldolase(30.Tellam R.L. Morton D.J. Clarke F.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 130-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and it was shown that a synthetic peptide corresponding to aldolase residues 32-52 binds to F-actin and specifically competes with native aldolase for F-actin binding(31.O'Reilly G. Clarke F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study we have used site-directed mutagenesis, falling ball viscometry (FBV), co-sedimentation binding assays, and negative stain electron microscopy (EM) to identify residues that are involved in the actin binding activity of aldolase. We present evidence that a specific molecular interaction involving several residues in and near the catalytic site of aldolase mediate its actin binding activity, and we show that modifications of single residues on this enzyme can result in significant alterations of its ability to form gel networks with F-actin. All biochemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Unless otherwise specified, protein concentrations were measured with Bio-Rad protein assay, using known concentrations of bovine serum albumin as standards. Site-directed mutagenesis (32.Taylor J.W. Ott J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8765-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) was performed to change Arg-42 (AGG), Lys-107 (AAG), and Arg-148 (CGT) codons to an Ala using the oligodeoxyribonucleotides (50 pmol): 5′-CATCGCGAAGGCGCTGCAATCG, 5′-GTGGGCATCGCGGTAGACAAG, and 5′-GCCAAGTGGGCTTGCGTGCTG, respectively. The Lys-229 → Ala mutation, and the Asp-33 → Ser mutations, as well as screening, subcloning, and DNA sequence confirmation of all mutations, and protein expression and purification were performed as described previously(33.Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1095-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular model of aldolase was generated with MOLSCRIPT (34.Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) using coordinates from the 3.0-Å resolution crystal structure of human muscle aldolase (35.Gamblin S.J. Cooper B. Millar J.R. Davies G.J. Littlechild J.A. Watson H.C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) on an Indigo workstation (Silicon Graphics, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Aldolase activity was determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance/minute at 340 nm in a coupled assay(36.Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 196: 347-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aldolase was diluted in 50 mM TEA•HCl, pH 7.4, and added to a cuvette containing 50 mM TEA•HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 0.16 mM NADH, 10 μg/ml glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/triosephosphate isomerase. Assays of 1 ml were performed in triplicate at 30°C following addition of substrate over a concentration range of 0.1-10-fold Km. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance using E280 (1%) = 0.91(37.Baranowski T. Niederland T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 180: 543-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic values were determined from double-reciprocal plots using the least squares method. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were determined using a protein concentration of 1.0 mg/ml, which was determined by absorbance at 280 nm, in 1 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 7.5, at 25°C with an AVIV 60DS spectrometer using a 0.1-cm path length cuvette. Spectra were taken from 180 to 260 nm with the readings averaged for 5 s at each 1-nm increment. FBV was performed as described previously(38.Wang J. Reitz F. Donaldson T. Pagliaro L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 28: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, actin was purified from rabbit back and leg muscle by the method of Pardee and Spudich (39.Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) with two polymerization-depolymerization cycles. Ammonium sulfate suspension of rabbit muscle aldolase was dialyzed against 40 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, 10 mM imidazole, pH 6.8 (IKMD buffer) overnight. IKMD was used as assay buffer for all experiments. Actin (0.5 or 1 mg/ml), mixed with aldolase or effectors as indicated, was drawn into a 100-μl glass pipette and incubated at 37°C for 30 min in a humidified chamber before viscometry measurements. 100-μl samples were prepared identically as samples for FBV, except that the final incubation was performed in 175-μl polyallomer centrifuge tubes (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) directly. After incubation, the samples were spun in an Airfuge (A-100/18 rotor, Beckman) at 30 p.s.i. (~120,000 × g) for 15 min at room temperature. Supernatants and pellets were separated, and pellets were resuspended in IKMD. Samples of supernatant fractions and pellets were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then stained with Coomassie Blue before they were scanned with an Arcus II Professional Desktop Scanner (Agfa-Gevaert N.V., Mortsel, Belgium). Quantification was performed with ImageQuant software, version 3.22 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). EM samples were prepared similarly to FBV samples, except that they were incubated as droplets in a Petri dish. After incubation, carbon-coated EM grids were overlaid on the droplets for 1.5 min, then washed with 37°C IKMD, stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 2 min, and dried. Sample grids were examined using a JEM 100-S electron microscope (JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody, MA). The five site-directed aldolase mutants we studied varied in both catalytic activity and actin binding activity; the Vmax and Km of wt and mutant aldolases are presented in Table 1. The K229A mutant knocked out catalytic activity, D33S decreased Vmax by about 4,000-fold, and the other mutants had smaller effects on Vmax (2-67-fold decreased). The R42A mutant retained catalytic activity closest to that of the wt molecule, with 50% of the wt Vmax, and about 3-fold higher Km. The K107A and R148A mutants had the largest increases in Km (9-13-fold).Tabled 1 Fig. 1 shows the locations of these residues on a MOLSCRIPT model of the 3.0-Å coordinates of human muscle aldolase. Human and rabbit muscle aldolase (aldolase A) share 99% sequence identity, with most of the differing residues in the amino-terminal end of the molecule, and none of them at or near the residues of interest in this report(35.Gamblin S.J. Cooper B. Millar J.R. Davies G.J. Littlechild J.A. Watson H.C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 40.Lai C.Y. Nakai N. Chang D.

Asp-33, Lys-107, Arg-148, and Lys-229 are located in the central catalytic site, and Arg-42 is just outside the catalytic site pocket. The CD spectra of the wild type and mutant proteins were similar (Fig. 2), indicating that these mutations did not cause major perturbations in the secondary structure. The substantial activity of all three mutant enzymes shown in Fig. 2 further indicated that these mutations did not cause major perturbations in the tertiary structure of the active site.Figure 2:Circular dichroism spectra of wild type and mutant aldolases at 25°C. One spectrum is shown for each enzyme; recombinant wild type rabbit muscle aldolase from pPB14 (○), R42A (◊), K107A (×), R148A (▵). CD spectra of D33S and K229A have been published previously(33.Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1095-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google ScholarView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Wild type and D33S gelled 0.5 mg/ml F-actin at ~0.7 and ~0.3 μM, respectively, indicated by a sharp rise in apparent viscosity to >1,500 centipoise (Fig. 3). At high enzyme concentration, however, solation occurred and the viscosity dropped below that of 0.5 mg/ml F-actin alone. Mutants R42A, K107A, and R148A caused minimal viscosity increase up to 3 μM enzyme concentration. K229A was intermediate, causing a slow viscosity increase between 0.5 and 2.5 μM enzyme concentration, after which viscosity started to drop. We also investigated the effects of FBP, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, fructose 1-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, D-ribose-5-phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate on the F-actin gelling activity of wt aldolase. Fig. 4 shows that FBP, DHAP and F1P all inhibited aldolase-F-actin gel formation (2 μM aldolase, 1 mg/ml actin) at less than 40 μM concentrations. Structurally similar compounds F6P, R5P, F-2,6-P, and the aldolase product G3P did not have any detectable effect on aldolase-F-actin gel in the same experimental concentration range, although they eventually did reverse the aldolase-F-actin gel at 500-1,000 μM concentrations (data not shown). We used a 15-min centrifugation at ~120,000 × g to separate free from actin-bound aldolase, and observed different co-sedimentation of wt and mutant aldolases with F-actin (Fig. 5). The co-sedimentation results correlated with FBV data. 3.0 μM wt and D33S aldolase co-pelleted with 1.0 mg/ml F-actin to about the same degree, while less than 10% of R42A, K107A, and R148A co-pelleted with actin; K229A pelleting activity was ~30% of wt. Enolase does not gel or bind to F-actin (18.Bronstein W.W. Knull H.R. Can. J. Biochem. 1981; 59: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 42.Pagliaro L. Kerr K. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 333-342PubMed Google Scholar) and was used as a negative control (data not shown). The mutant and the substrate inhibition viscometric data are consistent with partial overlap of the aldolase catalytic and actin-binding sites, consistent with previous reports(16.Clarke F.M. Morton D.J. Stephan P. Wiedemann J. Cell Motility: Mechanism and Regulation. University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo1985: 235-250Google Scholar, 23.Pagliaro L. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31.O'Reilly G. Clarke F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In view of this overlap, we predicted that addition of the substrate FBP to a sol of 10 μM aldolase and 0.5 mg/ml F-actin would increase viscosity, due to FBP's ability to compete with actin for aldolase binding and thus lower the effective aldolase concentration so as to permit gelation (Fig. 3). As the FBP concentration continued to increase, more aldolase would be competed off of actin, resulting again in a decrease of viscosity to the base line. The data in Fig. 6 are consistent with these predictions. At high aldolase concentrations the F-actin-aldolase gel is solated (Fig. 3), suggesting three possibilities. First, aldolase might sever F-actin (30.Tellam R.L. Morton D.J. Clarke F.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 130-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and bind to actin monomers or short oligomers, thereby reducing the mass of polymer, and solating the gel(17.Arnold H. Henning R. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 22: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Second, aldolase might bundle F-actin, thus reducing the highly cross-linked network of filaments, and induce solation. Third, at high concentration, aldolase might saturate all binding sites on the actin filaments, thereby allowing the gel to solate. The viscosity decrease below that of F-actin alone at high aldolase concentrations (Fig. 3) is inconsistent with the third possibility. We used negative stain EM to distinguish between the first two possibilities. At 1 μM wt aldolase concentration, 0.5 mg/ml F-actin was extensively bundled and cross-linked, as revealed by the formation of dense network of F-actin filaments (Fig. 7A). Actin filaments were also longer and straighter compared to F-actin alone (Fig. 7E). At 3 μM wt aldolase, F-actin was bundled to a higher degree, but these bundles were no longer cross-linked (Fig. 7C). Samples with 1 μM R42A and 0.5 mg/ml F-actin (Fig. 7B) were not distinguishable from those with F-actin alone; when R42A was increased to 3 μM, we observed limited F-actin bundle formation (Fig. 7D). We have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues in (Lys-107, Arg-148, and Lys-229) and near (Arg-42) the catalytic site as important sites for the actin binding activity of aldolase. None of these mutations induces significant secondary structural changes in aldolase, as detected with CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2 and (33.Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1095-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Lys-107, Arg-148, and Arg-42 each appear to be necessary, but not sufficient, for the normal actin binding activity of the wt molecule, since each mutation significantly reduces actin binding and gelling activity. Their location on aldolase confirms that the catalytic site overlaps with the actin-binding site topologically as well as functionally (Fig. 1). Previous studies used partial proteolysis to study the actin binding sites on aldolase(27.Humphreys L. Reid S. Masters C. Int. J. Biochem. 1986; 18: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31.O'Reilly G. Clarke F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This approach is very useful in identifying short primary sequences that are important for actin binding, but it cannot identify binding sites on the tertiary conformation of the molecule that result from discontinuous residues in the primary sequence. The acidic N-terminal region of actin is an attractive candidate for interaction with the positively charged residues we have identified on aldolase. However, there is evidence from a study with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies that aldolase does not bind to sequence regions 1-7, 18-28, or 40-113 on actin(43.Méjean C. Pons F. Benyamin Y. Roustan C. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Instead, the same study indicated that aldolase binds to the region around residue 299 on actin(43.Méjean C. Pons F. Benyamin Y. Roustan C. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In our experiments, aldolase gels F-actin at a stoichiometry of about 1 aldolase/25 actin monomers, so it must occupy a relatively small percentage of the potential aldolase binding sites on actin at this concentration. The ability to virtually knock out catalytic activity with D33S with minimal effect on actin binding activity establishes that these are specific, distinct activities. R42A has no F-actin gelling or binding activity, but high catalytic activity at about half of wt Vmax, while D33S has good F-actin gelling and binding activity but less than 0.04% of wt Vmax, confirming that one of the key sites for actin binding activity (Arg-42) is within resides 32-52 of aldolase, as proposed by O'Reilly and Clarke(31.O'Reilly G. Clarke F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Arg-42 has been implicated in binding the C6-phosphate of FBP from observations of the crystal structure(44.Gamblin S.J. Davies G.J. Grimes J.M. Jackson R.M. Littlechild J.A. Watson H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), however, the kinetic evidence of the R42A mutant enzyme does not support this proposal. Residues Arg-42, Lys-107, Arg-148 and Lys-229 are all likely to be positively charged at the experimental pH of 6.8, suggesting that electrostatic binding occurs between aldolase and F-actin. Some substrates and products of aldolase (FBP, F1P, and DHAP) can reverse the binding of wt aldolase to F-actin, consistent with at least partial overlap of catalytic and actin binding sites on aldolase, suggested by the location of Lys-107, Arg-148, and Lys-229 in the catalytic site. Chemical modification studies (40.Lai C.Y. Nakai N. Chang D. Science. 1974; 183: 1204-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis (K107H; (45.Takasaki Y. Kitajima Y. Takahashi I. Sakakibara M. Mukai T. Hori K. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1990; 344: 935-953PubMed Google Scholar)) have implicated Lys-107 in C6-phosphate binding. Arg-148 has been implicated in C1-phosphate binding due to its proximity to Lys-146(46.Hartman F.C. Brown J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3057-3062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of the mutants K107A and R148A are consistent with their roles in C6- and C1-phosphate binding, respectively. Both showed over 10-fold increases in Km for FBP and a 60 to 70-fold decrease in Vmax. The differences in activity of aldolase toward FBP and F1P have lead to the conclusion that the C1-phosphate binding is stronger than the C6-phosphate binding(47.Horecker B.L. Tsolas O. Lai C.Y. Enzymes. 1972; 7: 213-258Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This is supported by the aldolase-F-actin interactions measured here. F1P reversed aldolase-F-actin gels at more than an order of magnitude lower concentration than F6P; the same was true for the FBP/F-2,6-P pair and the DHAP/G3P pair. These data confirm that FBP, F1P, and DHAP reversal of aldolase-F-actin gelation is not due to nonspecific charge interactions. The effect of F-actin on the catalytic activity of aldolase has been studied previously. Two early studies showed that F-actin (or actin-containing filaments) caused an increase in aldolase Vmax and Km for FBP(24.Arnold H. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25.Walsh T.P. Clarke F.M. Masters C.J. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A more recent study, however, found that myofibrils acted as competitive inhibitors of aldolase and caused an increase in Km but not Vmax(29.Harris S.J. Winzor D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the active site residues Lys-107 and Arg-148 are necessary for normal aldolase-F-actin binding activity. However, Lys-107 and Arg-148 are also involved in FBP binding to aldolase(33.Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1095-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is reinforced by our findings with site-directed mutagenesis of these residues. Consequently, FBP must compete with actin for the substrate binding site, giving rise to an increase in Km. The simplest model consistent with our data is one in which actin and substrate compete for a single domain which includes both actin-binding and catalytic activities, with actin competitively inhibiting aldolase activity. An alternate model consistent with the reported increase in Vmax in the presence of actin (24.Arnold H. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25.Walsh T.P. Clarke F.M. Masters C.J. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) would require two actin-binding sites on each aldolase monomer, one of which is within the catalytic site, and the other of which is distinct from the catalytic site. This second site might involve Arg-42, or a residue in that vicinity. The increase in Vmax could be due to effects of binding at this site on the conformation or electrostatic configuration of the active site. Muscle aldolase exists as a tetramer(48.Beernink P.T. Tolan D.R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and kinetic evidence indicates that each subunit acts independently(49.Penhoet E.E. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 318-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus unlikely that, by binding to F-actin with one subunit, the catalytic activity of the other three subunits can be altered significantly to account for the observed increase in Vmax. Another possibility is that the active site mutants caused conformational changes in the Arg-42 vicinity which alter their apparent actin binding activity, while in fact the catalytic site is not directly involved in actin binding. This is also unlikely, however, since site-directed mutagenesis of many other residues in or near the active site does not cause major changes in aldolase structure(33.Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1095-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Takasaki Y. Kitajima Y. Takahashi I. Sakakibara M. Mukai T. Hori K. Prog. Clin. Biol.

Actin binding activity of enzymes has been implicated in many schemes for non-membrane-bound organization of glycolytic enzymes, but the specificity of these interactions has been open to question. Our results establish that there is a specific site on aldolase responsible for its interaction with actin. This is a significant step in confirming the existence of non-membrane-bound enzyme organization in cytoplasm. The ability of a single residue substitution to dramatically alter the binding characteristics of an enzyme is more consistent with highly organized metabolic machinery than with relatively nonspecific phase separation (51.Walter H. Brooks D.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) in cytoplasm. Our data also establish that solation of aldolase-F-actin gels by high concentrations of aldolase is due to bundling activity of aldolase, and that bundling is modulated by the substrate for aldolase, FBP. This behavior is entirely consistent with the concept of functional duality(16.Clarke F.M. Morton D.J. Stephan P. Wiedemann J. Cell Motility: Mechanism and Regulation. University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo1985: 235-250Google Scholar), and it provides evidence that a ubiquitous metabolic enzyme may play an integrative role in cytoplasmic organization.

Marked discrepancies exist with regard to the rate and specificity of this flip-flop process. To reinvestigate this problem, we have used both spin-labeled and radioactively labeled long chain phospholipids with a new fast translocation assay. Identical results were obtained with both types of probes. Transbilayer motion of glycerophospholipids was found to be much more rapid than previously reported (half-time less than 25 s) and to occur identically for phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. Such transport is nonvectorial and leads to a symmetric transbilayer distribution of phospholipids. In contrast, transverse diffusion of sphingomyelin was 1 order of magnitude slower. Phospholipid flip-flop appears to occur by a protein-mediated transport process displaying saturable and competitive behavior. Proteolysis, chemical modification, and competition experiments suggest that this transport process may be related to that previously described in the endoplasmic reticulum for short-chain phosphatidylcholine (Bishop, W. R., and Bell, R. M.(1985) Cell 42, 51-60). The relationship between phospholipid flip-flop and nonbilayer structures occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum was also investigated by 31P-NMR. Several conditions were found under which the 31P isotropic NMR signal previously attributed to nonbilayer structures is decreased or abolished, whereas transbilayer diffusion is unaffected, suggesting that the flip-flop process is independent of such structures. It is concluded that flip-flop in the endoplasmic reticulum is mediated by a bidirectional protein transporter with a high efficiency for glycerophospholipids and a low efficiency for sphingomyelin. In vivo, the activity of this transporter would be able to redistribute all changes in phospholipid composition due to biosynthetic processes between the two leaflets of the endoplasmic reticulum membranes within a time scale of seconds.

https://openalex.org/W2054484829,"Heme oxygenase is a central enzyme of heme degradation and associated carbon monoxide biosynthesis. We have prepared the α-hydroxyheme-heme oxygenase complex, which is the first intermediate in the catalytic reaction. The active site structure of the complex was examined by optical absorption, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopies. In the ferric form of the enzyme complex, the heme iron is five coordinate high spin and the α-hydroxyheme group in the complex assumes a structure of an oxophlorin where the α-meso hydroxy group is deprotonated. In the ferrous form, the α-hydroxy group is protonated and consequently the prosthetic group assumes a porphyrin structure. The α-hydroxyheme group undergoes a redox-linked conversion between a keto and an enol form. The ferric α-hydroxyheme reacts with molecular oxygen to form a radical species. Reaction of the radical species with a reducing equivalent yields the verdoheme-heme oxygenase complex. Reaction of the ferrous α-hydroxyheme-heme oxygenase complex with oxygen also yields the verdoheme-enzyme complex. We conclude that the catalytic conversion of ferric α-hydroxyheme to verdoheme by heme oxygenase requires molecular oxygen and one reducing equivalent."

In this work, the possibility that LAG-3 expression by human CD4+ T cells was preferentially related to one or another phenotype of cytokine secretion was investigated. Surface LAG-3 expression correlated with IFN-gamma, but not IL-4, production in antigen-stimulated T cells and it was up-regulated by IL-12. Most activated CD4+ T cell clones with established Th1 or Th0 profiles of cytokine secretion expressed LAG-3 on their surface, whereas the great majority of Th2 clones showed neither surface LAG-3 nor LAG-3 mRNA expression. After activation, the majority of CD4+ T cell clones also released soluble LAG-3-related peptides, and such a release correlated positively with the production of IFN-gamma and inversely with the production of IL-4. Thus, LAG-3 expression by activated CD4+ human T cells appear to be preferentially associated with the differentiation/activation pathway leading to the production of IFN-gamma."

The Gram-negative anaerobe, Oxalobacter formigenes, derives metabolic energy from the decarboxylation of oxalate (1.Allison M.J. Dawson K.A. Mayberry W.R. Foss J.G. Arch.

In O. formigenes, which provided the first case study of such a proton-motive cycle(3.Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 571-582Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), entry of divalent oxalate is coupled to the exit of its decarboxylation product, monovalent formate, leading to formation of an internally negative membrane potential. Because intracellular oxalate decarboxylation consumes a cytosolic proton, entry of negative charge is accompanied in stoichiometric fashion by appearance of internal hydroxyl ion. As a result, the combined activities of the vectorial antiport reaction and the scalar decarboxylation step comprise a thermodynamic proton pump(3.Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol.

Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reasoning was strengthened by finding that oxalate transport is catalyzed by a single protein, OxlT, whose SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisNMGN-methylglucamineMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propane-sulfonic acidkbkilobase(s)IPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. mobility (~38 kDa) resembles that of other bacterial carrier proteins(5.Ruan Z.-S.

However, it was not possible to complete the argument by examination of the OxlT amino acid sequence. For this reason, the work described here was directed to the cloning and sequencing of OxlT. An additional objective was to determine whether OxlT function is retained after expression in Escherichia coli. If so, future studies of this unusual antiporter could exploit the advantages of a genetically tractable host. The work described here indicates that the amino acid sequence of OxlT conforms to the general pattern found for most membrane carriers, including the presence of twelve likely transmembrane segments.

Cells were grown aerobically at 37°C in Luria Broth with drugs as required (100 μg/ml carbenicillin, 12 μg/ml tetracycline, and 50 μg/ml spectinomycin). Cells of O. formigenes from Dr. M. J.

The membrane with adsorbed OxlT was washed four times with distilled water and provided to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA), which reported NNPQTGQSTGLLGNRWFYLV (single-letter amino acid code) as the probable N-terminal sequence; there was indication of a ragged N terminus. A synthetic peptide of this same sequence was synthesized by the Peptide Core Facility (Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins Medical School). After conjugation of the peptide to bovine serum albumin(6.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the material by Hazelton Research Products (Denver, PA). Based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence noted above, we prepared two degenerate oligonucleotide probes. Oligo1 had the nucleotide sequence AA(C/T)AA(C/T)CCICA(A/G)ACIGGICA (where I indicates inosine), corresponding to amino acid residues 1-7 (NNPQTGQ); Oligo2 had the sequence AA(C/T)(A/C)GITGGTT(C/T)TA(C/T)(C/T)T and corresponded to residues 14-19 (NRWFYL). In preliminary work, Southern hybridization at 42°C with Oligo2 gave an unique hybridization band using O. formigenes genomic DNA digested completely by EcoRI, HindIII, or PstI. Oligo1 showed this same pattern but also hybridized to the λ-HindIII markers. Because the O. formigenes library was housed in lambda phage, we used Oligo2 for our initial screens. Lung et al.(7.Lung H.-Y. Cornelius J.G. Peck A.B. Am. J.

After three rounds of plaque purification, insert fragments of 10-16 kb were identified following SacI digestion. SacI fragments were further digested with PstI and subcloned to eventually yield a 3.2-kb PstI-SacI fragment that showed hybridization to both Oligo1 and Oligo2. This positive fragment was placed in pBluescript II KS-, giving pBKOxlTKS-, and a nested deletion series was prepared for sequencing. After identification of the gene encoding OxlT, the DNA sequence in this region was confirmed by second strand sequencing using plasmids selected from this same deletion series.

This 1.4-kb fragment was ligated into the XbaI-HindIII site of pBluescript II SK+ to generate pBKOxlTSK+, where expression of OxlT was regulated by the lac promoter. As a final step, pBKOxlTSK+ was placed in E. coli XL3 for functional tests. Double-stranded DNA was sequenced by the DNA Core Facility of the Johns Hopkins Medical School, using the dideoxy chain termination procedure of Sanger et al.(11.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R.

The nested deletion series was sequenced using universal primers for pBluescript II KS-; as primers for sequencing the oxlT opposite strand, we designed appropriate complementary synthetic oligonucleotides. An overnight preculture of E. coli XL3 carrying pBKOxlTSK+ was diluted 100-fold in fresh medium, and 1 mM IPTG was added 1 h later; IPTG-induced cells and uninduced control cells were harvested after an additional 4 h of growth. SDS-PAGE with 12% acrylamide was performed as outlined by Laemmli(12.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204702) Google Scholar).

After incubation at 4°C for 20 min, proteoliposomes were formed at 23°C by the addition of 5 ml of a dilution and loading buffer (pH 7). For estimates of oxalate self-exchange (Table 1), the loading buffer contained 100 mM potassium oxalate, 50 mM MOPS/K, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. To assess oxalate/formate exchange (see Fig. 5), the loading buffer was either 100 mM potassium formate or 100 mM NMG formate, along with 50 mM MOPS/K or 50 mM MOPS/NMG and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Formation of proteoliposomes was complete within 20 min, at which point we used one of two protocols to assess OxlT activity. In a rapid filtration assay (17.Ambudkar S.V. Anantharam V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12287-12292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to monitor oxalate self-exchange (Table 1), 0.2 ml of the proteoliposomal suspension was applied directly, under vacuum, to the center of a 0.22-μm GSTF Millipore filter. The external medium was removed by two 5-ml rinses with assay buffer (100 mM K2SO4 and 50 mM MOPS/K, pH 7), and on release of the vacuum the assay began as proteoliposomes were covered with 0.25 ml of assay buffer containing 100 μM [14C]oxalate. The reaction was terminated 3 min later by filtration and three quick rinses with assay buffer. Alternatively (see Fig. 5), formate-loaded proteoliposomes were isolated by centrifugation (16.Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and resuspended in a small volume of their K- or NMG-based loading buffers. Subsequently, they were diluted 120-fold into either NMG- or K-based assay buffers, as above, containing 100 μM [14C]oxalate, with or without 1 μM valinomycin. In this way, it was possible to generate a membrane potential whose polarity was either interior positive (potassium outside, NMG inside) or interior negative (NMG outside, potassium inside). As an additional basis for comparison, proteoliposomes were loaded with NMG-formate and tested using the NMG-based assay buffer.Tabled 1Figure 5:OxlT expressed in E. coli catalyzes the electrogenic exchange of formate and oxalate. The detergent extract of IPTG-induced cells carrying pBluescript II SK+ (Fig. 4 legend) was used to prepare proteoliposomes (or liposomes) loaded with potassium formate or NMG formate, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To begin the reaction, proteoliposomes (or liposomes) were diluted into NMG- or potassium-based assay medium (as shown) containing 100 μM [14C]oxalate with 1 μM valinomycin or the equivalent amount of carrier ethanol as shown. Samples were taken for filtration and washing at the indicated times. The presence of external potassium (Kout) or internal potassium (Kin) is indicated on the graph. Proteoliposomes (and liposomes) loaded and assayed using only NMG-based solutions were also tested, but these data have been omitted for clarity. Transport by these particles (with or without valinomycin) was essentially identical in rate and extent to the ionophore-untreated controls shown here.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Protein content was estimated using a modification of the procedure of Schaffner and Weissman(18.Schaffner W. Weissman C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). [14C]Oxalate (4.8 mCi/mmol) was from DuPont NEN; octyl-β-D-glucoside was from Boehringer Mannheim; phospholipid was purified from crude E. coli lipid (Avanti Polar Lipids) as described earlier(16.Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other reagents were of the highest purity available. In the absence of a positive selection procedure, we cloned OxlT by obtaining N-terminal sequence information from the purified protein and designing appropriate oligonucleotide probes with which to screen an O. formigenes library (see “Experimental Procedures”). Initial screening of a λ-GEM library gave positive inserts of 10-16 kb; subcloning eventually yielded a 3.2-kb fragment whose sequence included two overlapping open reading frames on opposite DNA strands of a 1.4-kb interval. One of these open reading frames specified a hydrophobic protein whose N-terminal sequence matched that determined for purified OxlT (Fig. 1), and we tentatively identified this gene as our desired target, oxlT; later functional tests (below) verified the assignment. The oxlT sequence has been submitted to GenBank (accession number U40075). The DNA sequence of the gene, oxlT, indicates that expression of its encoded protein (OxlT) follows patterns well established for bacterial systems. Thus, a likely promoter having −35 and −10 sequences of TTGAAA and TTCAAT, respectively, occupies a 29-base interval ending 70 nucleotides upstream of the initiating codon, AUG. Transcriptional termination is probably mediated by a 31-base stem-loop structure (AAAAAAGCCCGGCTTTCCGCCGGGCTTTTTT) that begins 72 nucleotides from the first of two in-frame stop (UAA) codons. Analysis of the deduced OxlT amino acid sequence (Fig. 2) reveals a novel hydrophobic protein of 418 amino acid residues having a predicted mass of 44,128 daltons. No proteins with significant homology to OxlT were found in a EMBL BLITZ search of the Swiss Protein Data Base using the Smith and Waterman (19.Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (6862) Google Scholar) algorithm; similarly, we found no proteins related to the hypothetical hydrophilic protein specified on the OxlT noncoding strand. Analysis of OxlT hydropathy according to the method of Kyte and Doolittle (20.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16728) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3) suggests the presence of 12 hydrophobic segments, each of sufficient length to constitute a transmembrane α-helix (TM1-12). A similar analysis according to Rost et al.(21.Rost B. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) predicts 11 transmembrane α-helices, including TM1 and TM3-12 (Fig. 3) but excluding TM2, whose peak hydropathy value is the lowest of the 12 putative transmembrane segments (Fig. 3). Although membrane carriers with 11 transmembrane segments have been described in bacteria(22.Sarero J.P. Pittard A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Maloney P.C. Wilson T.H. Neidhardt F. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1130-1148Google Scholar), it is more typical to find examples with 10 or 12 transmembrane regions(4.Maloney P.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 571-582Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23.Maloney P.C. Wilson T.H. Neidhardt F. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed.

For this reason, our initial model of OxlT topology (Fig. 3) assumes the 12 transmembrane segments suggested by analysis of hydropathy. This initial model also conforms to the common finding (4.Maloney P.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 571-582Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23.Maloney P.C. Wilson T.H. Neidhardt F.

Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 708-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) of a central cytoplasmic loop that separates the regions containing TM1-6 and TM7-12. To orient the proposed OxlT structure with respect to cytoplasmic and extracellular phases, we used the observation of von Heijne (25.von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar) that transmembrane segments often have an excess of positively charged residues at their cytoplasmic ends, especially in bacterial systems. It is evident that in our proposed structure (Fig. 3, top), charged residues are assigned to either the extracellular (net charge of −1) or cytoplasmic (net charge of +13) surfaces, with the exception of the single lysine residue (Lys355) that appears within TM11 (Fig. 3). To determine whether the gene tentatively identified as oxlT specifies the OxlT transport protein, we constructed a vector (pBKOxlTSK+) that brings protein expression under control of the lac promoter. Expression of the encoded protein and assays of its function were then carried out in XL3, a strain also carrying a middle copy compatible plasmid (pMS421) encoding the gene for LacIq. This gave strong repression in the absence of IPTG and allowed us to propagate pBKOxlTSK+ without selective pressures that might accompany constitutive or otherwise unregulated protein expression. The experiments described in Fig. 4 and 5 document that the gene identified as oxlT specifies the OxlT transport protein and that the main features of OxlT function are retained in E. coli. Thus, antibody directed against the OxlT N terminus reported expression of OxlT in IPTG-induced cells carrying pBKOxlTSK+ but not in uninduced cells or in cells carrying the parent pBluescript II SK+ (with or without IPTG) (Fig. 4). It is also evident that SDS-PAGE profile of OxlT when expressed in E. coli resembles that of authentic OxlT, from O. formigenes, including the presence of both monomeric (~35 kDa) and dimeric (~65 kDa) forms of the protein (Fig. 4)(5.Ruan Z.-S. Anantharam V. Crawford I.T. Ambudkar S.V. Rhee S.Y. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10537-10543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equally important, in this same experiment we showed that appearance of OxlT immunoreactivity coincides with acquisition by induced cells of a capacity to catalyze both the oxalate self-exchange reaction and the electrogenic exchange of oxalate and formate. For such functional tests, we prepared detergent extracts from both induced and uninduced cells (Fig. 4). To examine oxalate self-exchange, oxalate-loaded proteoliposomes were washed free of external substrate by filtration on Millipore filters (0.22-μm pore size), and then, while still affixed to the filters, they were covered for 3 min with an assay medium containing 100 μM [14C]oxalate, followed by a final filtration and wash. This test (Table 1) gave no indication of oxalate transport by cells bearing pBluescript II SK+ (± IPTG) (0.02 μmol/mg protein). By contrast, uninduced cells with pBKOxlTSK+ displayed a low but significantly positive signal (0.14 μmol/mg protein), whereas IPTG induction led to markedly increased accumulation of label (2.3 μmol/mg protein) (Table 1). The detergent extract from IPTG-induced cells was also used to prepare proteoliposomes loaded with the potassium or NMG salts of formate so as to monitor the exchange of oxalate with formate (Fig. 5). The particles were diluted into media containing NMG sulfate or potassium sulfate, respectively, so that addition of valinomycin established an electrical gradient, internally negative or positive in polarity. Such trials were unambiguous in their findings: imposition of an internally positive electrical potential strongly stimulated the oxalate transport observed in controls not treated with the ionophore, whereas imposition of an internally negative potential completely inhibited the reaction. Proteoliposomes prepared and assayed in the absence of potassium were unaffected by valinomycin and showed oxalate transport virtually identical to that found for the potassium- or NMG-loaded proteoliposomes not exposed to valinomycin (Fig. 5 legend). Similar findings had been reported earlier (3.Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Ruan Z.-S. Anantharam V. Crawford I.T. Ambudkar S.V. Rhee S.Y. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10537-10543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for OxlT reconstituted from O. formigenes. In both instances, the pattern of response indicates that the exchange of oxalate and formate is electrogenic, with negative charge moving in parallel with oxalate. Because the pKa's for oxalate are 1.23 and 3.83, the simplest model is that the OxlT transporter, whether expressed in O. formigenes or E. coli, mediates exchange of divalent oxalate and monovalent formate. The work summarized here had as its main goal the cloning and sequencing of OxlT, the oxalate/formate antiport protein of O. formigenes. Several criteria show this goal has been met. In particular, the cloned gene specifies the N-terminal sequence found in authentic OxlT (Fig. 1), and expression of this gene confers upon E. coli the capacity to mediate both the homologous self-exchange of oxalate and the heterologous, electrogenic exchange of oxalate with formate (Table 1 and Fig. 5). We therefore conclude that this antiport protein retains its most important functional properties when expressed in E. coli. It is likely the main physical characteristics of OxlT are also preserved in E. coli, because the OxlT SDS-PAGE profiles in E. coli and O. formigenes are equivalent (Fig. 4) and because the positive response to an N-terminal peptide-directed antibody suggests OxlT retains its natural N terminus (Fig. 4). Analysis of the OxlT amino acid sequence reveals a polytopic hydrophobic protein (Fig. 3) whose general structure resembles that of known membrane carriers in the several respects(4.Maloney P.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 571-582Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22.Sarero J.P. Pittard A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Henderson P.J.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 708-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) : (i) the presence of 12 (or 11) presumed transmembrane segments; (ii) N- and C-terminal regions facing the cytoplasm (presuming an even number of transmembrane segments); (iii) the finding of a cytoplasmic loop midway along the sequence (residues 190-219), separating the region containing TM1-6 from that containing TM7-12; and (iv) an excess of positively charged residues at the presumed cytoplasmic surface. Although there is no apparent sequence homology between OxlT and known membrane carriers (or other transporters), these general features, along with the earlier biochemical characterization, are sufficient to classify OxlT as a conventional secondary transport protein. The OxlT predicted structure has two additional features deserving of specific comment. First, we note the presence of a single charged residue (Lys355) within TM11 (Fig. 3, top). Because OxlT substrates are anionic (oxalate2⁻ and formate1⁻), the presence of this apparently uncompensated positive charge in the hydrophobic sector prompts the hypothesis that Lys355 forms part of an anionic binding center within the substrate translocation pathway. Preliminary tests are compatible with this idea, because several uncharged substitutions at position 355 give variants that fail to transport, whereas the K355R derivative retains activity. 2K. Abe and P. C. Maloney, unpublished results. A second finding of interest is that OxlT has only two cysteine residues (Cys28 and Cys271). Because neither of these cysteines is required for function,2 OxlT presents an attractive target for cysteine scanning mutagenesis, an approach that has proven valuable to the study of several membrane transport systems(26.Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 27.Jung K. Jung H. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28.Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Evaluation of oxalate transport (Table 1 and Fig. 5) supports the idea that the main features of OxlT selectivity are retained in E. coli. Moreover, calculations using these data suggest that the unusually high velocity of OxlT is also preserved in this expression system. Thus, detergent extracts from induced E. coli yielded a potential-stimulated oxalate/formate antiport rate of 24 μmol/min/mg protein (Fig. 5), whereas for the same conditions we found an exchange rate of 16 μmol/min/mg protein using O. formigenes(3.Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). And in further work (not given), we found the kinetic parameters of oxalate self-exchange to be the same in E. coli and O. formigenes(3.Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Michaelis constants of 0.2 ± 0.03 versus 0.24 mM, and maximal velocities of 102 ± 7 versus 99 μmol/min/mg protein, respectively). Because immunoblots gave about equal staining for nearly equivalent amounts of E. coli or O. formigenes membrane protein (see Fig. 4 legend), it appears that OxlT is expressed at comparable levels in the two cell types. Accordingly, the specific activity of OxlT is largely unaffected by expression in E. coli. We note that the transport rates observed in crude extracts from E. coli (~20-100 μmol/min/mg protein) are unusually high but that this is anticipated for OxlT, which has the highest known maximal velocity among carriers of organic substrates (5.Ruan Z.-S.

The two major protein components of HDL are apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and apoA-II. To study the role of apoA-II in lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis, we have developed three lines of C57BL/6 transgenic mice expressing human apoA-II (lines 25.3, 21.5, and 11.1). Northern blot experiments showed that human apoA-II mRNA was present only in the liver of transgenic mice. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis demonstrated a 17.4-kDa human apoA-II in the HDL fraction of the plasma of transgenic mice. After 3 months on a regular chow, the plasma concentrations of human apoA-II were 21 ± 4 mg/dl in the 25.3 line, 51 ± 6 mg/dl in the 21.5 line, and 74 ± 4 mg/dl in the 11.1 line. The concentration of cholesterol in plasma was significantly lower in transgenic mice than in control mice because of a decrease in HDL cholesterol that was greatest in the line that expressed the most apoA-II (23 mg/dl in the 11.1 line versus 63 mg/dl in control mice). There was also a reduction in the plasma concentration of mouse apoA-I (32 ± 2, 56 ± 9, 91 ± 7, and 111 ± 2 mg/dl for lines 11.1, 21.5, 25.3, and control mice, respectively) that was inversely correlated with the amount of human apoA-II expressed. Additional changes in plasma lipid/lipoprotein profile noted in line 11.1 that expressed the highest level of human apoA-II include elevated triglyceride, increased proportion of total plasma, and HDL free cholesterol and a marked (>10-fold) reduction in mouse apoA-II. Total endogenous plasma lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity was reduced to a level directly correlated with the degree of increased plasma human apoA-II in the transgenic lines. LCAT activity toward exogenous substrate was, however, only slightly decreased. The biochemical changes in the 11.1 line, which is markedly deficient in plasma apoA-I, an activator for LCAT, are reminiscent of those in patients with partial LCAT deficiency. Feeding the transgenic mice a high fat, high cholesterol diet maintained the mouse apoA-I concentration at a normal level (69 ± 14 mg/dl in line 11.1 compared with 71 ± 6 mg/dl in nontransgenic controls) and prevented the appearance of HDL deficiency. All this happened in the presence of a persistently high plasma human apoA-II (96 ± 14 mg/dl). Paradoxical HDL elevation by high fat diets has been observed in humans and is reproduced in human apoA-II overexpressing transgenic mice but not in control mice. Finally, HDL size and morphology varied substantially in the three transgenic lines, indicating the importance of apoA-II concentration in the modulation of HDL formation.

The amino acid sequence of Grx3 consists of 82 residues and contains a redox-active motif, Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys, typical of the glutaredoxin family. Sequence comparison reveals a homology (33% identity) to that of glutaredoxin-1 (Grx1) from E. coli as well as to other members of the thioredoxin superfamily. In addition to the active site cysteine residues, Grx3 contains one additional cysteine (Cys65) corresponding to one of the two non-active site (or structural) cysteine residues present in mammalian glutaredoxins. The sequence-specific 1H and 15N nuclear magnetic resonance assignments of reduced Grx3 have been obtained. From a combined analysis of chemical shifts, 3JHNα coupling constants, sequential and medium range NOEs, and amide proton exchange rates, the secondary structure of reduced Grx3 was determined and found to be very similar to that inferred from amino acid sequence comparison to homologous proteins. The consequences of the proposed structural similarity to Grx1 are that Grx3, while possessing a largely intact GSH binding cleft, would have a very different spatial distribution of charged residues, most notably surrounding the active site cysteine residues and occurring in the proposed hydrophobic protein-protein interaction area. These differences may contribute to the observed very low Kcat of Grx3 as a reductant of insulin disulfides or as a hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase.

Investigation of pla-centas from diabetic mothers indicate chronic dis-turbances in intervillous circulation, dilatation of capillaries, and a relatively immature villous struc-ture. Abnormal levels of nitric oxide (NO) may contribute to maternal disorders such as the patho-genesis of diabetic vascular complications. In the normal placenta NO is generated only by endothelial NOS, which apparently serves to regulate vascular tone in the fetoplacental circulation. In contrast, studies have reported the absence of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in human placentas under normal conditions. The aim of our study was to investigate whether iNOS is expressed in placentae from patients with gestational diabetes. Reverse transe ription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis demonstrated iNOS mRNA and protein expression in placental tissue only from patients with gestational diabetes. Immunohistochemistry localized iNOS staining to endothelial cells and trophoblasts. We conclude that iNOS can be expressed in human placenta. Its expression might play an important role in placental pathophysiology.—Schönfelder, G., John, M., Hopp, H., Fuhr, N., van der Giet, M., Paul, M.

https://openalex.org/W2078603373,"Human erythroid spectrin dimer assembly is initiated by the association of a specific region near the N-terminal of β-spectrin with a complementary region near the C-terminal of α-spectrin (Speicher, D. W., Weglarz, L., and DeSilva, T. M.(31.Speicher D.W. Weglarz L. DeSilva T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14775-14782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 14775-14782). Both spectrin subunits consist primarily of tandem, 106-residue long, homologous, triple-helical motifs. In this study, the minimal region of β-spectrin required for association with α-spectrin was determined using recombinant peptides. The start site (phasing) for construction of dimerization competent β-spectrin peptides was particularly critical. The beginning of the first homologous motif for both β-spectrin and the related dimerization site of α-actinin is approximately 8 residues earlier than most spectrin motifs. A four-motif β-spectrin peptide (β1-4⁺) with this earlier starting point bound to full-length α-spectrin with a Kd of about 10 nM, while deletion of these first 8 residues reduced binding nearly 10-fold. N- and C-terminal truncations of one or more motifs from β1-4⁺ showed that the first motif was essential for dimerization since its deletion abolished binding, but β1⁺ alone could not associate with α-monomers. The first two motifs (β1-2⁺) represented the minimum lateral dimer assembly site with a Kd of about 230 nM for interaction with full-length α-spectrin or an α-spectrin nucleation site recombinant peptide, α18-21. Each additional motif increased the dimerization affinity by approximately 5-fold. In addition to this strong inter-subunit dimer association, interactions between the helices of a single triple-helical motif are frequently strong enough to maintain a noncovalent complex after internal protease cleavage similar to the interactions thought to be involved in tetramer formation. Analysis of hydrodynamic radii of recombinant peptides containing differing numbers of motifs showed that a single motif had a Stokes radius of 2.35 nm, while each additional motif added only 0.85 nm to the Stokes radius. This is the first direct demonstration that spectrin's flexibility arises from regions between each triple helical motif rather than from within the segment itself and suggests that current models of inter-motif connections may need to be revised.

The membrane skeleton of the human erythrocyte consists of a network of proteins that associates with the inner surface of the cell membrane and imparts remarkable structural integrity and flexibility to circulating erythrocytes. Spectrin is the major structural component of this specialized submembranous protein network. The basic functional unit of spectrin is a heterodimer formed by side-to-side, antiparallel association of a 280-kDa α subunit with a 246-kDa β subunit. Spectrin dimers associate head-to-head to form tetramers, the predominant form of spectrin in the membrane skeleton. These tetramers cross-link short actin oligomers, an association modulated by band 4.1, to form a dynamic two-dimensional submembrane latticework. Other associated proteins include: ankyrin, adducin, calmodulin, tropomyosin, tropomodulin, and band 4.9 (for reviews, see Bennett and Gilligan (3.Bennett V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev.

Electron microscopy of spectrin dimers shows flexible 100-nm long rod-like molecules with strong lateral association of the subunits near the physical ends of the rods and weak associations in the central region (Shotton et al. 29.Shotton D.M.

This ability of the spectrin molecule to shorten and extend as well as its flexibility are attributed to the series of homologous 106-residue segments or motifs initially identified by partial peptide sequence (Speicher and 3esi, 1984) and confirmed by complete sequencing of cDNAs for the α subunit (Sahr et al., 25.Sahr K.E.

Analysis of spectrin motif conformational phasing (the boundaries for complete folding units) using recombinant proteins established the starting point of properly folded spectrin motifs at approximately positions 26-30 of the original sequence alignment (Winograd et al., 1991).

Previous studies of lateral association of α and β subunits (Morrow et al., 20.Morrow J.S. Speicher D.W. Knowles W.J. Hsu C.J. Marchesi V.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The latter study used a HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride: GST, glutathione S-transferaseTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization. gel filtration assay to analyze association of tryptic peptides with complementary spectrin subunits. These analyses showed that dimer assembly occurs very rapidly (within seconds) and that dimerization required a specific region at the tail end of the subunits represented by the tryptic αV and βIV domains (Speicher et al., 1992). These tryptic domains include most or all of the repetitive segments α19-21 and β1-4. Interaction of these regions is apparently the initial step of dimer assembly, which is followed by subsequent lateral association of additional α and β motifs. A mutation in α-spectrin in this region has been identified, αLELY, that affects dimer assembly (Alloisio et al., 1.Alloisio N. Morle L. Marechal J. Roux A.-F. Ducluzeau M.-T. Guetarni D. Pothier B.

When this mutation is present along with an elliptocytosis mutation on the same chain, symptoms of the elliptocytosis mutation are often silent or mitigated since the αLELY mutation will decrease incorporation of the mutated chain onto the membrane. In contrast, elliptocytosis mutations on the opposite allele from the αLELY mutation enhance incorporation of α subunit carrying the elliptocytosis mutation onto the membrane (Garbarz, 9.Garbarz W. Nature. 1994; 372: 620-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar; Wilmotte et al., 1993).

In the current study, we purified and extensively characterized a series of β nucleation region recombinant peptides for proper polypeptide chain folding, dimer binding affinity, and hydrodynamic properties. These analyses show that the minimum β peptide for dimer assembly contained the first two homologous motifs, but not the actin binding domain, and each additional motif further increased dimer binding affinity. Analysis of hydrodynamic radii of these recombinant peptides provided the first direct demonstration that spectrin's flexibility apparently resides in the connecting region between triple helical motifs rather than within the segment itself. Spectrin was extracted from fresh human red cells within 24 h of collection and α-monomers were purified as described previously (Speicher et al., 1992) using a modification of the ion exchange purification initially developed by Yoshino and 3esi(41.Yoshino H. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4496-4500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify specific regions of the β-spectrin nucleation site from the cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). Primers contained restriction enzyme sites for BamHI and EcoRI, at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, to allow directional cloning of the insert into the pGEX-2T expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Five β-spectrin nucleation site clones and one α-spectrin nucleation site clone were produced for this study. The specific oligonucleotide primers used are listed in Table 1. Initially, the start site (phasing) for a clone encompassing the first four homologous β motifs, β1-4, used the codon for amino acid residue 301, which corresponds to the phasing reported by Winograd et al. (1991). Further analysis of the potential start site of this β1-4 peptide led to the production of another clone, β1-4⁺, which contains eight additional codons at the N terminus of the expressed peptide. Subsequent truncations of full motifs on the C-terminal and N-terminal ends of the β1-4⁺ recombinant were prepared as described in Table 1.Tabled 1 The entire α-spectrin nucleation site, encompassing repetitive motifs α18-21, was designed essentially as described above with the exception that the nucleotide sequence contained a BamHI restriction enzyme site. Therefore, the oligonucleotides used for polymerase chain reaction were designed to contain a BglII site both at the 5′ and 3′ ends. This restriction enzyme creates the same overhang as BamHI thus allowing cloning into the BamHI site of pGEX-2T. A BglII site near the 3′ end of the region to be amplified was apparently not changed by altering the spectrin sequence in the 3′ primer. This resulted in utilization of the stop codon of the pGEX-2T vector. A single motif α recombinant, α1 (residues 50-158), was prepared as described previously (Kotula et al., 1993). All expression plasmids were transformed into the DH5α strain of Escherichia coli. Each construct was completely sequenced to verify the integrity of the recombinant vectors. The α- and β-spectrin cDNA clones were kindly provided by Dr. Bernard Forget (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Overnight cultures of the cells were diluted 1:20 in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were grown to an optical density of 0.5-0.7 at 550 nm before induction with 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mM. Cells were induced for 3 h before collection by centrifugation. Cell pellets were stored at −80°C and thawed on ice just before use. Fusion proteins were purified as described previously (Kennedy et al., 12.Kennedy S.P. Warren S.L. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, each 600-ml cell pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 0.15 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) and sonicated to lyse the cells. The supernatant of the lysed cells was collected by centrifugation. The β1-2⁺ fusion protein was released into the supernatant after lysis and this supernatant could be loaded directly onto a reduced glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia). The fusion proteins of α18-21, β1-3⁺, β1-4, β1-4⁺, and β2-4 were primarily in inclusion bodies and were extracted in 25 ml of urea buffer (5 M urea, 50 mM Tris, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 0.15 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 8.0) using a Dounce homogenizer and incubation on ice for 2 h. The supernatant was collected and dialyzed against 500 ml of renaturation buffer (126.6 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 0.15 mM PMSF, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin, 20% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.3) for 2-3 h followed by an overnight dialysis against 2 liters of PBST (126.6 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 5 mM EDTA, 0.15 mM PMSF, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.3). The renatured fusion proteins were then purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. Peptides were cleaved from the GST molecule in the elution buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM reduced glutathione, pH 8.0) using bovine thrombin (Sigma). NaCl (final concentration 150 mM) was added to the elution buffer prior to thrombin digestion for the β1-4⁺ and β1-3⁺ fusion products to decrease the formation of secondary cleavage products. The ratio of thrombin to fusion protein and the potential advantage of raising the ionic strength was determined empirically for each fusion protein. The optimal thrombin cleavage conditions were: β1-4, 20 units/mg; β1-4⁺, 10 units/mg; β1-3⁺, 2 units/mg; β1-2⁺, 4 units/mg; β2-4, 1 unit/mg; and α18-21, 1 unit/mg for 3 h at 37°C. Cleaved peptides were purified by rechromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose column followed by HPLC gel filtration on two preparative (21.5 × 600 mm) TSK-gel columns (G3000SW + G2000SW) in series (TosoHaas) in phosphate-buffered saline (126.6 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 mM PMSF, 0.05% sodium azide, pH 7.3). Spectrin α-monomers or the α18-21 peptides were mixed with purified recombinant nucleation site β-peptides and incubated at 0°C for different times ranging from 5 min to 15 h. Under most conditions equilibrium was reached within 5 to 15 min, hence a 25-min incubation time was used for most binding assays. To determine Stokes' radius, the proteins and peptides were separated on two analytical (7.8 × 300 mm) TSK-gel columns (G3000SWXL + G2000SWXL) at 4°C with a flow rate of either 0.4 or 0.8 ml/min. Binding experiments used only the G3000SWXL column at 1.0 ml/min at 4°C in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Eluted proteins were detected by absorbance at 280 nm and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (excitation 280 nm, emission filter 370 nm) and were quantified on a data acquisition system (PE Nelson Analytical) using peak area. Response factors for each protein were determined by replicate injections of known quantities (determined by quantitative amino acid analysis) for each component. Molecular weights used for calculating molarity were: α-monomer, 280,000; β1-4, 52,085; β1-4⁺, 52,964; β1-3⁺, 40,374; β1-2⁺, 27,998; β1⁺, 15,681; β2-4, 38,924; α18-21, 51,938. Association (Ka) and dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of β-spectrin nucleation region peptides with intact α-spectrin monomers were determined by calculating the amount of unbound peptide relative to control samples under the same conditions. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using 7 and 10% slab gels (1.5 × 100 mm) as described by Laemmli(15.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). For low molecular weight components, 5-15% gradient Tricine gels were used (Schagger and von Jagow, 26.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10498) Google Scholar). All gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. After separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, peptides were transferred onto high retention polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) as described previously (Mozdzanowski et al., 21.Mozdzanowski J. Hembach P. Speicher D.W. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After staining with Amido Black, the bands of interest were excised and sequenced on a Hewlett-Packard G1005A sequencer as described previously (Reim and Speicher, 24.Reim D.F. Speicher D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). CD spectra were performed on a Jasco J720 instrument at room temperature in a 0.2-mm path length cell. Proteins were in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.3, and protein concentrations were determined by duplicate quantitative amino acid analysis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry was performed on a PerSeptive Biosystems Vestec Mass Spectrometer using Voyager software. Proteins were dialyzed into 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, 1 μl of sample was mixed with 1 μl of matrix solution (saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid for samples <20 kDa and sinapinic acid for samples >20 kDa in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 33% acetonitrile), the sample/matrix mixture was transferred to the sample target, dried, and analyzed. Expected masses were calculated from known sequences using the GPMAW program (Lighthouse Data, Denmark). As noted above, previous results using spectrin peptides from mild protease cleavage of purified spectrin monomer mapped the spectrin dimer nucleation site to approximately the last three to four homologous motifs of the α subunit and the first four homologous motifs of the β subunit (Speicher et al., 1992). To determine the minimal nucleation site requirements of β-spectrin as well as physical properties of this region, a series of recombinant peptides were produced by truncating the previously defined β-spectrin nucleation region (β1-4) at either the N terminus or the C terminus. In addition, an α-spectrin nucleation site peptide was constructed that included the entire putative nucleation site region on the α subunit, α18-21. The sequence content of each peptide is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1A and their relationship to the overall motif structure of a spectrin dimer is shown in Fig. 1C. As illustrated, the phasing of each recombinant peptide correlates with the boundaries of homologous triple helical motifs as defined by the high resolution structure of a single motif determined by Yan et al.(1993) with the exception of the “+” series of β-peptides, which begin 8 residues before the predicted repetitive segment (see below). In addition to the recombinant constructs shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1A, the β1⁺ peptide was isolated as a proteolytic by-product of the β1-2⁺ construct. During purification of the β1-2⁺ peptide, a highly specific cleavage product was observed due to cleavage at residue 425 (see Fig. 1A) as defined using MALDI mass spectrometry which yielded an experimental mass after removing the GST moiety by thrombin cleavage of 15,688 Da (data not shown). This proteolytically produced peptide contained the entire β1⁺ motif with only a few additional residues on the C-terminal end (see Fig. 1A), was native as shown by circular dichroism and gel filtration, and was easily separated from the parent β1-2⁺ peptide by gel filtration. All recombinant peptides were expressed in bacterial cells as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST), which was cleaved and separated from the recombinant proteins prior to use for functional studies. The purity of all peptides was >95% (Fig. 1B). The N termini of the cleaved peptides were confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis and masses were confirmed by MALDI mass spectrometry (data not shown). The β1-4 construct was difficult to cleave from the GST moiety and a substantial amount of a secondary cleavage product was produced (lane 4, Fig. 1B). N-terminal sequence analysis of this smaller peptide showed that it resulted from a secondary cleavage after Arg374, which is located in the turn between helices B and C of motif β1. The full-length β1-4 peptide and its cleavage product could not be separated by either ion exchange or gel filtration chromatography due to their similar size, charge, and other physical properties. The unusual difficulty encountered with thrombin cleavage of the GST-β1-4 construct relative to other GST fusion proteins containing complete spectrin motifs (see below) led to further evaluation of the β1 start point. To examine the relationship between the longer α-actinin and spectrin nucleation region motifs relative to the more common 106-residue motif, the last four α-spectrin (α18-21), the first four β-spectrin (β1-4), and the four spectrin-type motifs of human cytoskeletal α-actinin were aligned against numerous 106-residue spectrin motif sequences using the computer program ALIGN to perform optimized pairwise alignments. Gaps and insertions of the longer motifs relative to the 106-residue motif and its associated crystallographic structure were placed (Fig. 2A) in the most frequently aligned position from the individual pairwise comparisons. Two observations emerged from this alignment. First, all insertions larger than a single residue mapped to two regions, an 8-residue segment near the beginning of the motif that probably extends the A helix as previously suggested (Viel and Branton, 35.Viel A. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10839-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and variable length insertions that map to the turn region between helices B and C. Second, a number of prolines are located in positions that were helical in the reported high resolution structure of the Drosophila α14 motif (Yan et al., 1993), which supports the hypothesis that the nucleation site motifs have a unique conformation responsible for initiating dimerization. Based on the alignment in Fig. 2, it was hypothesized that the first motif should have an 8-residue insertion in helix A relative to the more typical 106-residue motif, since the three C-terminal α-actinin motifs (A2, A3, and A4) and their most homologous spectrin counterparts (β2, α20, and α21, respectively) all contained an extra 8 residues in this region. This prediction of a start site for the first motif that is 8 residues earlier than the initial β1-4 recombinant compares favorably with the observed mild protease cleavage sites for both α-actinin and β-spectrin as shown in Fig. 2B. In addition, although various start sites have been reported for the α-actinin motif based on alignments of sequences, the revised start site presented here for the first motif of spectrin and α-actinin agrees with the recent phasing analysis of α-actinin using recombinant peptides reported by Gilmore et al.(10.Gilmore A.P. Parr T. Patel B. Gratzer W.B. Critchley D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the phasing of the first β motif, a β1-4⁺ recombinant peptide, which started at residue 293 compared with residue 301 for the β1-4 peptide, was produced and analyzed in parallel with the β1-4 peptide. Thrombin cleavage of the β1-4⁺ and β1-4 fusion proteins differed markedly at physiological ionic strength. The β1-4⁺ fusion protein was efficiently cleaved without production of secondary cleavage products. In contrast, under the same conditions, <50% of the β1-4 protein was cleaved and a prominent secondary cleavage product was formed (data not shown). All spectrin recombinant peptides were analyzed by circular dichroism to determine whether the peptides were properly folded. Representative spectra are shown in Fig. 3 and all peptides reported here had high α-helicity (about 80%) similar to spectrin dimers and monomers. The Stokes' radii of the β-spectrin nucleation site recombinant peptides and a single motif α subunit peptide, α1 (residues 50-158), were determined by HPLC gel filtration using standard proteins with known Stokes' radii to calibrate the column. The observed hydrodynamic radii were linearly related to the number of repetitive motifs as shown in Fig. 4. A single repetitive segment, either β1⁺ or α1, has a Stokes' radius of 2.35 nm and each additional motif increases the molecular size by only 0.85 nm. The Stokes' radius of the β1-4 peptide falls below the line created by the other nucleation site peptides and was not included in the linear regression calculation. This smaller Stokes' radius is indicative of a more compact molecular shape for this improperly phased β1-4 peptide, however, it did have normal helicity as determined by circular dichroism. In order to identify the minimal requirements for the β-spectrin nucleation site and the effects of additional motifs on binding affinity, the recombinant β peptides were evaluated in solution binding assays with either purified native α-spectrin monomers or recombinant α18-21. Time course experiments showed that binding equilibrium was usually reached within 5 min or less under most concentrations and molar ratios evaluated. Therefore, protein mixtures were routinely incubated for 25 min prior to measurement of complex formation using a rapid HPLC gel filtration separation as shown in Fig. 5. Free α-monomers could not be resolved from complexes due to the small change in size when the complex was formed. Therefore, carefully quantified amounts of α-monomers and recombinant peptides were combined and association constants were determined by measuring the loss of recombinant peptide from its normally eluting position relative to an identical control without α-monomer. Control experiments showed that only equimolar binding occurred and that any dissociation of complex that occurred during the analysis did not increase the area of the unbound recombinant peptide peak. As shown in Fig. 5, no detectable binding was observed for the β1⁺ or β2-4 peptides. In addition, no binding to α-monomers was detected for these two proteins when as much as a 3- or 5-fold molar excess of recombinant peptide was used. The β1⁺ peptide, although required for nucleation site binding, is apparently not sufficient. Binding affinities of the recombinant β peptides with α-monomers are summarized in Table 2. The importance of N-terminal phasing for the first β motif is illustrated by the observation that the β1-4 peptide has n"
https://openalex.org/W1505105817,"Abstract The pH dependence and solvent isotope sensitivity of three discrete steps in the reductive half-reaction of xanthine oxidase have been investigated. The pH dependence of both k/K from steady-state experiments and k/Kfrom rapid reaction experiments with xanthine as substrate indicate that enzyme reacts preferentially with the neutral form of substrate and that an ionizable group in the active site having a pK of 6.6 must be unprotonated for reaction to take place. The solvent kinetic isotope effect on k/K is 2.4, once a uniform shift on going to D2O of 1 unit for both pK values is taken into account. The pH dependence of the formation and decay of E-P formed in the course the reaction of xanthine oxidase with lumazine has also been examined. Formation of this complex exhibits bell-shaped pH dependence, with pK values of 6.5 and 7.8, consistent with the results obtained with xanthine. Decay of the E-P complex is base-catalyzed with a pK > 11 and exhibits a small solvent kinetic isotope effect of 1.7 at pH/D 8.5. By contrast, the catalytic intermediate giving rise to the “very rapid” EPR signal that is transiently observed in the course of the reaction of enzyme with the substrate 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine is found to undergo acid-catalyzed breakdown with an associated pK < 6. Formation and decay of this species exhibit solvent kinetic isotope effects of 2.0 and 3.5 at pH 10. The results are discussed in the context of a specific reaction mechanism for the reductive half-reaction of xanthine oxidase, in which discrete ionizations associated with the molybdenum center of the active site play critical roles in determining the magnitude of the rate constants by which the Mo(IV)-P and Mo(V)-P intermediates form and decay."

In this study, we have characterized the interaction of the Ras-binding domain of Raf with Ras using equilibrium binding methods (scintillation proximity assay and fluorescence anisotropy), rather than with more widely used nonequilibrium procedures (such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and affinity precipitation). Initial studies using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins with either residues 1-257 or 1-190 of Raf showed that although it was possible to detect Ras binding using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or affinity precipitation, it was substoichiometric; under equilibrium conditions with only a small excess of Raf almost no binding was detected. This difference was probably due to the presence of a high percentage of inactive Raf protein. Further studies used protein containing residues 51-131 of Raf, which expressed in Escherichia coli as a stable glutathione S-transferase fusion. With this protein, binding with Ras could readily be measured under equilibrium conditions. The catalytic domain of neurofibromin inhibited binding of Ras to Raf, and Raf inhibited the binding of Ras to neurofibromin showing that Raf and neurofibromin cannot be bound simultaneously to Ras. The affinities of interaction of neurofibromin and Raf with Harvey-RasLeu-61 were similar. The rate constant for dissociation of Raf from Ras was estimated to be >1 min⁻1, suggesting that Ras, Raf, and neurofibromin may be in rapid equilibrium in the cell. In contrast to previous reports, under equilibrium conditions there was no evidence for a difference in affinity between the minimal Ras binding domain of Raf (residues 51-131) and a region containing an additional 16 carboxyl-terminal amino acids, suggesting that residues 132-147 do not form a critical binding determinant.

Herein, we investigated the interactions between the Nef protein and the signaling pathways triggered by the PDGF receptor, which are among the best characterized(18.Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). HIV1-nefBRU full-length cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Montaigner, anti-Nef and anti-PDGF receptor antibodies by Dr. Samuel and by Dr. Heldin. Anti-p85, anti-PLC-γ, and anti-Ras-GAP were from UBI. PDGF-BB was from Amersham. Either full-length nef cDNA subcloned in the eukaryotic expression vector pZip-neo or an empty expression vector as control was introduced into NIH 3T3 by Lipofectin (Life Technologies Inc.). Cells were co-transfected with pSV2neo, selected in the presence of 0.7 mg/ml G418 (Sigma) and analyzed for the expression of nef. Five to ten individual clones expressing a comparable amount of protein were pooled. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously(19.Graziani A. Gramaglia D. Cantley L.C. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22087-22090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), incubating the extracts with protein A-Sepharose precoupled with anti-PDGF-R antibodies. Immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were solubilized in boiling Laemmli buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Hybond, Amersham). Specific binding was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECLTM, Amersham). PI 3-kinase activity was assayed on the immunoprecipitates in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and phosphoinositides (Sigma), as described previously(19.Graziani A. Gramaglia D. Cantley L.C. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22087-22090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these conditions, PI 3-kinase phosphorylates preferentially PI(4,5)P2, generating PI(3,4,5)P3(20.Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B. Auger K. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 265: 19704-19711Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells were cultured onto glass coverslips coated with poly(D-lysine). The cells were loaded with the calcium indicator fura-2/AM (21.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) for 45 min at 37°C. Cells were then washed twice in Tyrode's solution (154 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM NaHepes, 5.5 mM glucose, NaOH to pH 7.4) and stimulated by switching to the same solution containing different concentrations of PDGF. Intracellular calcium levels were determined on groups of 10-15 cells as described(22.Connor J.A. Cornwall M.C. Williams J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2919-2927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 24-well plates (105 cells/well) and incubated in DMEM/1% FCS alone or containing either increasing concentrations of PDGF or 10% fetal calf serum. After 4 days, cells were fixed with 11% glutaraldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, 20% methanol, and counted. Stimulation of chemotaxis was determined using TranswellsTM (6.5 mm, Costar), with two compartments separated by an 8-μm pore polycarbonate membrane. 105 cells in 200 μl of DMEM/1% FCS were placed in the upper compartment. One ml of DMEM/1% FCS, alone or containing the stimulating factor, was added to the lower compartment. Plates were incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for 6 h. Cells migrated to the lower side of the filter were fixed, stained as above, and solubilized in 10% acetic acid. Absorbance was measured at 590 nm. The nef gene was cloned into a eukaryotic cell expression vector, under the control of the murine mammary tumor virus constitutive promoter, and transfected in murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts expressing physiological levels of PDGF receptors. Stable transfectants were selected by G418 resistance, cloned and analyzed for nef expression by Western blot of whole cell lysates. Clones expressing the p27nef protein were combined in two pools according to the level of nef expression (line 3.0, low; line 3.9, high; Fig. 1A). Clones transfected with an empty vector (line 2.0) were pooled together and used as control cell line. In cells expressing either low or high levels of Nef, the amount of PDGF receptors was unchanged (Fig. 1B). Moreover, upon ligand stimulation, the receptor was tyrosine-phosphorylated to the same extent (Fig. 1C). Nef did not affect the kinetics of the receptor kinase in response to varying concentrations of ligand (data not shown). These data indicate that Nef does not interfere with the cell surface expression or the tyrosine kinase activity of the PDGF receptor. It is known that, upon ligand stimulation, the PDGF receptor binds PI 3-kinase via the p85 regulatory subunit(18.Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). In nef transfectants, the amount of PI 3-kinase activity associated with the immunoprecipitated receptor upon PDGF stimulation was about 10-fold lower, compared to mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). This was confirmed measuring the physical association between the PDGF receptor and p85 by immunoprecipitation and Western blot (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, nef expression also resulted in a significant reduction of the basal PI 3-kinase activity associated with the receptor in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2A). The inhibition on the formation of the PI 3-kinase•receptor complex correlated with the amount of nef expression (cf. Fig. 1A and 2, A and B). The viral protein did not affect the total cellular content of PI 3-kinase, measured by probing whole cell lysates with anti-p85 antibodies (data not shown). The possibility that Nef inhibits PI 3-kinase/receptor association by direct binding to p85 or to the receptor was ruled out by measuring PI 3-kinase activity in anti-Nef immunoprecipitates and by probing anti-p85 or anti-PDGF receptor immunoprecipitates with anti-Nef antibodies (data not shown). Moreover, no evidence of Nef tyrosine phosphorylation upon PDGF stimulation was obtained (data not shown). In order to establish whether the Nef inhibition on PI 3-kinase association is a selective event or a consequence of a general interference with the binding between the receptor and cytosolic transducers, PLC-γ and Ras-GAP were studied. After ligand stimulation, both transducers did bind to the PDGF receptor with the same efficiency in cells either mock-transfected or expressing low or high amounts of Nef (Fig. 2, C and D). We then investigated whether nef expression could interfere with other signaling pathways, downstream to the receptor. PDGF stimulation increases intracellular calcium concentration by a dual mechanism: (a) a rapid release from intracellular stores and (b) a slow influx from the extracellular environment(23.Berk B.C. Alexander R.W. Brock T.A. Gimbrone M.A. Webb R.C. Science. 1986; 232: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). nef expression did not affect the calcium response when high concentrations of PDGF were used (100 ng/ml; Fig. 3A). At low concentrations of PDGF (1 ng/ml), only the rapid release was slightly enhanced. PDGF also triggers an intracellular serine kinase cascade leading to activation of MAP kinase. This activation follows phosphorylation of MAP kinase at serine and tyrosine residues, which results in a mobility shift that can be observed in Western blots(24.Wood K. Sarnecki C. Roberts T. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Expression of nef did not interfere with MAP kinase activation in all cell lines tested (Fig. 3B). A modest enhancement of MAP kinase phosphorylation in resting cells was observed. In NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, PDGF-BB elicits a dual biological response, consisting of cell growth and chemotaxis(25.Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 243: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The growth response was severely impaired in nef transfectants, even in those expressing low levels of the viral protein. Inhibition was still evident even at high PDGF concentrations (up to 100 ng/ml, Fig. 4A). Cellular growth in the presence of serum was not affected, indicating that Nef acts as inhibitor of PDGF signaling rather than as inhibitor of cell proliferation per se. On the other hand, when cell migration toward a gradient of PDGF was evaluated, no difference in cell motility was detected between nef transfectants and controls (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that among the signal transduction pathways triggered by PDGF receptor, Nef inhibits selectively those leading to cell proliferation. This work shows that the HIV protein Nef interferes with signaling pathways in a model system generated by stable transfection of the nef gene in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Nef protein inhibits the complex formation between PI 3-kinase and the tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF receptor. The biochemical mechanisms underlying such inhibition are unclear. Nef may compete with p85 (the docking subunit of PI 3-kinase) for the binding with specific phosphorylated tyrosines of the receptor(18.Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). On the other hand, through its proline-rich motif Nef might bind the p85 SH3 domain. However, these hypotheses were not supported by co-precipitation experiments. Alternatively, as Nef is involved in a specific endocytic cellular pathway(1.Trono D. Cell. 1995; 82: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), it may sequester PI 3-kinase, making the enzyme unavailable for receptor binding. Finally, the viral protein may inhibit the interaction, by modifying either the PDGF receptor or the PI 3-kinase. PDGF receptor phosphorylation on tyrosine was unaffected. Nef, however, has been reported to form a complex with a cellular serine kinase(10.Sawai E.T. Baur A. Struble H. Peterlin B.M. Levy J.A. Cheng-Mayer C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and serine phosphorylation leads to negative modulation of PI 3-kinase (26.Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M. Gout I. Totty N. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S. Waterfield M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism, the effect of Nef on PI 3-kinase is selective, as the association between the PDGF receptor and PLC-γ or Ras-GAP was not perturbed. Similarly, no significant alterations were observed when downstream events of the signaling cascade, such as Ca2⁺ increase and MAP kinase activation, were analyzed. These results do not confirm a previous study reporting Nef-mediated inhibition of intracellular calcium mobilization in PDGF or bombesin-stimulated fibroblasts; intriguingly, no inhibition of PLC-mediated PIP2 hydrolysis was detected(16.De S.K. Marsh J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6656-6660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The authors suggest that Nef may act on IP3 receptor regulation or expression, rather than directly on signal transduction. The conflicting results reported here may depend on the different Nef alleles transfected. Indeed, either increased or decreased calcium responses were observed in murine T cells expressing different Nef alleles(8.Skowronski J. Parks D. Mariani R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 13.Luria S. Chambers I. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5326-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, PDGF-BB elicits a dual biological response, stimulating cell growth and chemotaxis(25.Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 243: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). It is known that the signaling pathways involved are distinct, although partially overlapping(27.Kundra V. Anand-Apte B. Feig L. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We show that Nef selectively inhibits PDGF-dependent proliferation, without affecting chemotactic migration. As activation of PI 3-kinase is essential for both responses, the apparent paradox can be explained by a different threshold of PI 3-kinase activation required for proliferation or chemotaxis(27.Kundra V. Anand-Apte B. Feig L. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28.Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In nef transfectants, the low signal transduced by the residual receptor•PI 3-kinase complex could be sufficient to elicit the chemotactic response. A “threshold effect” has also been invoked to explain how epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor elicit different biological responses in PC12 cells by activating the same signaling pathway to a different extent(29.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4209) Google Scholar). Recently, a rare SIV-nef allele has been reported to act as an oncogene in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts(30.Du Z. Lang S.M.

However, the growth-stimulating properties of the SIV-nef allele depend on two closely spaced tyrosine-containing specific sequences (31.Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar) which are not present in HIV1-nef. Recent evidence suggests that nef is a major determinant in AIDS pathogenesis, by enhancing viral replication in host cells stimulated by mitogens(1.Trono D. Cell. 1995; 82: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). It is not know whether the uncoupling of PI 3-kinase from growth factor receptors is at all involved. However, it is intriguing to speculate that nef may promote viral growth by redirectioning proliferative signals, arisen from growth factor receptors, to the viral replication machinery. Indeed, the binding of Nef to SH3 domains is required to achieve optimal viral replication in infected cells(11.Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Finally, besides affecting viral replication, nef may contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis by altering T cell responses to antigenic stimulation(8.Skowronski J. Parks D. Mariani R.

https://openalex.org/W2036017658,"LytA amidase is the best known bacterial autolysin. It breaks down the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine bonds in the peptidoglycan backbone of Streptococcus pneumoniae and requires the presence of choline residues in the cell-wall teichoic acids for activity. Genetic experiments have supported the hypothesis that its 36-kDa chain has evolved by the fusion of two independent modules: the NH2-terminal module, responsible for the catalytic activity, and the COOH-terminal module, involved in the attachment to the cell wall. The structural organization of LytA amidase and of its isolated COOH-terminal module (C-LytA) and the variations induced by choline binding have been examined by differential scanning calorimetry and analytical ultracentrifugation. Deconvolution of calorimetric curves have revealed a folding of the polypeptide chain in several independent or quasi-independent cooperative domains. Elementary transitions in C-LytA are close but not identical to those assigned to the COOH-terminal module in the complete amidase, particularly in the absence of choline. These results indicate that the NH2-terminal region of the protein is important for attaining the native tertiary fold of the COOH terminus. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies have shown that LytA exhibits a monomer ↔ dimer association equilibrium, through the COOH-terminal part of the molecule. Dimerization is regulated by choline interaction and involves the preferential binding of two molecules of choline per dimer. Sedimentation velocity experiments give frictional ratios of 1.1 for C-LytA monomer and 1.4 for C-LytA and LytA dimers; values that deviated from that of globular rigid particles. When considered together, present results give evidence that LytA amidase might be described as an elongated molecule consisting of at least four domains per subunit (two per module) designated here in as N1, N2, C1, and C2. Intersubunit cooperative interactions through the C2 domain in LytA dimer occur under all experimental conditions, while C-LytA requires the saturation of low affinity choline binding sites.

The relevance of the structural features deduced here for LytA amidase is examined in connection with its biological function. Autolysins are enzymes that specifically degrade some bonds in the peptidoglycan backbone of the bacterial cell walls and eventually cause cell lysis(1.Rogers H.J. Perkins H.R. Ward J.B. Microbial Cell Wall and Membranes. Chapman and Hall, London1980: 437-460Google Scholar). These enzymes have been involved in many important physiological functions(2.Tomasz A. Nombela C. Microbial Cell Wall Synthesis and Autolysins. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1984: 3-12Google Scholar). The best known bacterial autolysin is the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase of Streptococcus pneumoniae of 36.5 kDa, referred to here as LytA 1The abbreviations used are: LytAmajor autolysin from S. pneumoniaeC-LytACOOH-terminal module of LytAΔHcalorimetric enthalpy changeΔH∗vHvan't Hoff enthalpy change derived from deconvolution analysisΔHcvHvan't Hoff enthalpy change calculated as 4RTm2ΔCpm/ΔH (where ΔCpm is the maximum of the excess heat capacity function, Tm is the temperature of the maximum, and R is the gas constant)ssedimentation coefficientf/f0frictional ratioRSStoke's radii of hydration. amidase(3.López R. García J.L. García E. Ronda C. García P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 100: 439-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S. pneumoniae is one of the microorganisms that causes high mortality and morbidity in the world and it has been proposed that the autolytic process might be one of the factors responsible of its pathogenicity(4.Shan F. The Lancet. 1990; 335: 38-43Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that LytA amidase induces a protective response in mice and can be a potential antigen to prepare a pneumococcal vaccine (5.Berry A.M. Lock R.A. Hansman D. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2324-2330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pneumococcal lytA gene was the first autolytic gene that was cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in an heterologous host (6.García P. García J.L. García E. López R. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 43: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This fact provided the tools for a more detailed biochemical and genetical characterization of the enzyme(7.García P. García J.L. García E. Sánchez-Puelles J.M. López R. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 86: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). LytA amidase requires the presence of choline residues in the cell wall teichoic acids for activity. In this sense, S. pneumoniae is one of the rare microorganisms that contain choline in the cell envelope, and it does not autolyze when choline is replaced by ethanolamine in the culture medium(8.Tomasz A. Zanati E. Ziegler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1848-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments have provided solid evidence that the enzyme has evolved by the fusion of two independent modules: the NH2-terminal module, responsible for the catalytic activity, and the COOH-terminal module, involved in the attachment to the cell wall(9.Díaz E. López R. García J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8125-8129Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that the binding of the autolysin to its insoluble substrate (the cell wall) is an essential prerequisite for the hydrolysis of the covalent bonds. The COOH-terminal module of LytA, that is built by six repeated units of 20 amino acids, appears to play a double function, fixing the enzyme to the choline residues of cell wall and inducing its activation by a process called conversion(10.Briese T. Hakenbeck R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 146: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the COOH-terminal module of LytA (C-LytA) can be expressed and folded independently(11.Sánchez-Puelles J.M. Sanz J.M. García J.L. García E. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), a finding that has allowed the construction of fusion proteins that can be purified by affinity chromatography in a single-step process in matrices derived with DEAE, an analogue of choline(12.Sanz J.M.

Although genetic approaches have provided substantial evidence on the modular design of the LytA amidase, few data concerning to its structure have been obtained by biochemical and physicochemical techniques. Hence, we have studied the structural organization in cooperative domains of the LytA amidase and its COOH-terminal module using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The oligomerization state and the molecular shape of both proteins have been characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation. In addition, we have determined the influence of choline as an analogue of the protein substrate on the thermal unfolding of LytA and C-LytA, as well as on their self-association equilibria. By combining results from thermal unfolding and ultracentrifugation a model for molecular organization of LytA is suggested. Finally, the structural characteristics of the amidase are examined in connection with its biological function. LytA amidase and C-LytA protein were purified from Escherichia coli DH1(pGL100) (13.García J.L. García E. López R. Arch. Biochem. 1987; 149: 52-56Google Scholar, 14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and E. coli DH1(pCE17) (11.Sánchez-Puelles J.M. Sanz J.M. García J.L. García E. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) cells, respectively, using an affinity chromatographic procedure(12.Sanz J.M. López R. García J.L. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fractions showing the maximum LytA amidase activity or the maximum C-LytA concentration were pooled and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(15.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204800) Google Scholar). Samples for calorimetric and ultracentrifugation analyses were extensively dialyzed against the appropriate buffer at 4°C and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a MSE microcentrifuge for 5 min. LytA and C-LytA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the molar absorption coefficients at 280 nm of 113,750 and 62,540 M-1 cm-1, respectively(6.García P. García J.L. García E. López R. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 43: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11.Sánchez-Puelles J.M. Sanz J.M. García J.L. García E. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Choline concentration was measured by differential refractometry in a Ll3 interferometer (Zeiss Jena), using a double sector cell of 1 cm optical path and a specific differential refraction index of 0.021 M-1 in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.9. Enzymatic assays were carried out using [methyl-3H]choline-labeled pneumococcal cell walls as described previously(16.Díaz E. López R. García J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5464-5471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required for the solubilization of 1 μg of cell walls in 10 min. DSC measurements were performed using a Microcal MC-2 instrument (Microcal, Inc. Northampton, MA) at a heating rate of 0.33 K min-1, unless otherwise stated, and under an extra constant pressure of 2 atm. The standard DA-2, Cpcalc, and Microcal Origin softwares were used for data acquisition and analysis. Reversibility of thermal transitions was checked by reheating the samples after a first scan. The influence of scanning rate on the calorimetric irreversible profiles was checked running samples at 0.2, 0.75, and 1 K min-1. The excess heat capacity functions were obtained after subtraction of buffer base line. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments of C-LytA and LytA were performed by centrifugation of 80-μl samples at 25°C and 15,000 and 20,000 rpm, respectively, in an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments), employing 12-mm double sector epon-charcoal centerpieces. Radial scans were taken at 4-h intervals at 280 nm until the equilibrium condition was reached. Base-line offsets were determined taking a radial scan at equilibrium speed, after running the samples 5 h at 42,000 rpm. Conservation of mass in the cell was checked in all the experiments. Apparent weight-averaged molecular weights were obtained by fitting individual data sets to a sedimentation equilibrium model for single species, using the signal conservation algorithm (17.Minton A.P. Schuster T.H. Lave T.H. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkh ä user, Boston1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar) from EQASSOC and XLAEQ programs. The equilibrium dimerization constants, K2, were calculated by fitting experimental data to a monomer ↔ dimer sedimentation equilibrium model using the ORIGIN version of the NONLIN algorithm(18.Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using the signal conservation algorithm(17.Minton A.P. Schuster T.H. Lave T.H. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkh ä user, Boston1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar). The monomer molecular masses (in daltons) were constrained to the following: 36,530 for LytA and 16,500 for C-LytA. The partial specific volumes for C-LytA and LytA calculated from aminoacid composition were 0.725 and 0.722 ml g-1(19.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Horton H.C. Rowe A.J. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry & Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1992: 90-125Google Scholar). The specific volume of choline measured with a DM2 Paar precision density meter was 0.885 ml g-1. The variations in the calculated specific volumes of both proteins assuming 2 mol of bound ligand/monomer (see below) were less than 0.3%. The experiments were performed at 25°C and 60,000 rpm, using protein concentrations of about 0.5 mg ml-1. Radial scans at 280 nm were taken every 10 min. The sedimentation coefficients were calculated from the movement of the sedimentation boundary using the XLAVEL program (Beckman). The experimental values were converted to standard conditions (s20w) and the frictional ratio, Stokes' radii of hydration, and axial ratios were derived as described by Waxman et al.(20.Waxman E. Laws W.R. Lave T.M. Nemerson Y. Ross J.B.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), using the molecular weight determined by sedimentation equilibrium under the same experimental conditions. The specific hydration grade of both proteins was assumed to be 0.28 g of H2O/g of protein(21.Pessen H. Kumosinski T.F. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 219-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fig. 1(bottom trace) shows the typical DSC scan of thermal denaturation of LytA in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.9. The thermogram is characterized by a broad peak centered at about 45°C, followed by a sharper one with a maximum at 58°C. The reversibility of the overall endotherm is temperature-dependent and indicates the existence of different processes. Nevertheless, DSC curves recorded at different scanning rates did not show significant variations either in the form or in the enthalpy of the endotherm (data not shown), excluding kinetic control in any of the processes(22.Freire E. van Osdol W.W. Mayorga U.L. Sánchez-Ruiz J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 159-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Considering the complexity of the endotherm associated to LytA thermal denaturation, the interaction with choline, a specific ligand of the COOH-terminal region, was studied (Fig. 1). Choline binding has a clear influence on the peak at highest temperature, as reflected by the strong shift induced in the Tm value. This result suggests that at least that peak should correspond to the melting of the COOH-terminal module of LytA. On the other hand, above 80 mM choline, thermal denaturation of LytA proceeds in two well resolved peaks. The reversibility of the thermal-induced transitions was unaffected by choline interaction. Increasing NaCl concentration up to 0.28 M did not modify the thermal denaturation profile of LytA, discarding ionic strength effects. The detailed analysis of the calorimetric curves (see Fig. 1) shows that denaturation of LytA can be resolved into three independent two-state transitions and a final asymmetric peak characterized by a ΔHcvH/ΔH ratio of 1.4 (Fig. 1 and Table 1), suggesting the existence of intermolecular interactions(23.Freire E. Comments Mol. Cell Biophys. 1989; 6: 123-140Google Scholar). The asymmetry of the peak and the value of ΔHcvH/ΔH would be consistent with a dimer which dissociates upon denaturation. The transitions centered near 41°C and 51°C are rather choline-independent up to about 80 mM ligand concentration, supporting the notion that they should correspond to the unfolding of the NH2-terminal region of LytA. However, above such concentration, the low temperature calorimetric peak cannot be deconvoluted into two elementary transitions, revealing a higher interdependence. The final steps, 3 and 4, are stabilized by increasing concentrations of ligand, suggesting that both transitions correspond to the melting of the COOH-terminal region of the protein. The denaturation profile of the COOH-terminal module of LytA in phosphate buffer at pH 6.9 is shown in Fig. 2(trace A). Its thermal unfolding is characterized by a major peak with a maximum at 61°C and a small broad shoulder centered at about 40°C. Heating C-LytA up to 50°C results in the irreversible disappearance of the shoulder (Fig. 2, curve B). The peak centered at 61°C is about 50% reversible (Fig. 2, trace C) and scan rate-independent (data not shown). The value of the ΔHcvH/ΔH ratio for this peak is 0.67, revealing that it is not a two-state process. Fig. 3 shows the melting curves of C-LytA at increasing concentrations of choline. The influence of ligand binding on the thermal stability of C-LytA is complex and exhibits a biphasic character. At the lowest ligand concentration assayed, C-LytA shows a broad heat absorption curve and the total enthalpy change increases from 162 kcal mol-1, in the absence of ligand, up to 220 kcal mol-1, at 5 mM choline. Within this ligand concentration range, the intensity of the small shoulder observed in the free protein increases and its transition temperature is shifted to higher values. The major peak is also shifted up to 63.6°C, and its cooperativity becomes strongly protein-concentration dependent (data not shown). Above 10 mM choline, a single asymmetric peak is observed (see Fig. 3) and the calorimetric profile is slightly dependent on protein concentration (data not shown). Under these conditions, the ratio ΔHcvH/ΔH is 0.60, indicating the existence of intermediates. Reversibility of C-LytA thermal denaturation is dependent on choline concentration. Above 40 mM choline, 80% reversibility is achieved, while at lower concentrations, renaturation never exceeds 50%. The analysis of the calorimetric profiles at low ligand and protein concentrations shows that C-LytA denaturation can be described by three independent transitions (see Fig. 3 and Table 2). The calorimetric enthalpy changes of the two first endotherms increase with choline concentration up to 52 and 75 kcal mol-1, respectively, without changes in their van't Hoff enthalpies. On the contrary, the highest temperature transition is characterized by a constant enthalpy change of 115 kcal mol-1 and a ΔH∗vH/ΔH ratio of 0.95 (see Table 2). Above 10 mM choline, thermal denaturation of C-LytA can be resolved into two transitions, stabilized by increasing concentrations of ligand (Table 2). The former is a two-state process with a calorimetric enthalpy change of 75 kcal mol-1, while ΔHcvH for the latter endotherm is about 1.4 times that of ΔH (150 kcal mol-1), indicating, as in LytA amidase, intermolecular interactions(23.Freire E. Comments Mol. Cell Biophys. 1989; 6: 123-140Google Scholar). The choline-induced variations observed in the thermal denaturation process of C-LytA suggest the existence of at least two types of binding sites with different affinity. At low choline concentration, ligand binding favors the refolding of the COOH-terminal module into a native-like tertiary structure, reducing the fraction of C-LytA molecules containing a region that does not undergo a cooperative unfolding transition in the free protein. Since calorimetric data are normalized to the total protein concentration, this effect would result in a reduced calorimetric enthalpy for the observed transition. At high choline concentrations, ligand binding seems to trigger intermolecular cooperativity. On the other hand, the similarity of behavior of C-LytA transitions 2 and 3 with with that of transitions 3 and 4 of LytA agrees with their previous assignments to the unfolding of the COOH-terminal module. Differences in Tm values and cooperativity, particularly at low choline concentration, reveals the influence of the NH2-terminal module on the final organization and stability of the complete polypeptide chain. The self-association behavior of C-LytA and LytA was investigated by sedimentation equilibrium measurements in the absence and in the presence of increasing concentrations of choline. C-LytA sedimented as a monomer in 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 8.0, but dimers are present at equilibrium at pH 6.9 (Fig. 4, panels A and B). LytA forms dimers at both pH values, and the equilibrium constant is about 10 times that of C-LytA at pH 6.9 (Table 3; Fig. 4, panel C). Choline binding strongly enhances the dimerization of both proteins. Other oligomeric forms were not observed, even at the highest concentrations of protein and choline assayed. Table 3 summarizes the dimerization equilibrium constants under different experimental conditions. The slopes of Wyman plots (24.Wyman J. Gill S. Binding and Linkage. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1990: 46-49Google Scholar) of choline-induced dimerization are 1.93 and 1.96 for LytA and C-LytA, respectively, and essentially indicate the preferential interaction or binding of 2 choline molecules/formed dimer. Characterization of the hydrodynamic behavior of both proteins was performed by sedimentation velocity. The sedimentation coefficients, s20w, of monomeric and dimeric C-LytA are 2.1 S (20 mM phosphate, pH 8.0) and 2.5 S (20 mM phosphate, 140 mM choline, pH 6.9), respectively. No correction for protein concentration dependence of s was performed since the LytA and C-LytA concentrations employed were low enough to assume no significant effect. Taking into account the molecular masses of both C-LytA species, these s20w correspond to f/f0 of 1.1 (monomer) and 1.4 (dimer). These values are consistent with prolate ellipsoids of 15 × 31 Å for the monomer and 10 × 130 Å for the dimer; indicating that the global hydrodynamic behavior of both species deviates from that of a globular rigid particle(25.Tanford Ch. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley & Sons, New York1961: 254-264Google Scholar), being more pronounced in the case of the dimer. The sedimentation coefficient of LytA dimer is 4.2 S (10 mM choline), which corresponds to a f/f0 of 1.4. This value is consistent with a prolate ellipsoid of 13 × 190 Å. The impossibility of having 100% of LytA monomer hampered its hydrodynamic characterization. The effect of temperature on the aggregation state of C-LytA was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation. Protein samples were heated for 30 min at different temperatures before running the ultracentrifugation experiments at 25°C. Heating C-LytA at 50°C in the presence of 3 mM choline does not modify its dimerization constant at 25°C. At this ligand concentration, high order aggregates are observed by increasing protein concentration when the heating is performed at 85°C. In contrast, at 140 mM choline only C-LytA dimers are present after heating at the same temperature. This set of experiments allows the following conclusions. (i) The irreversible low temperature shoulder cannot be assigned to dimer dissociation since the quaternary structure is preserved at low temperature after heating; (ii) the enhanced cooperativity of the last transition observed by increasing protein concentration at intermediate choline saturation is due to the aggregation of the thermally denatured state, since the native protein under similar conditions exists always as a dimer; (iii) the irreversibility of C-LytA thermal denaturation at low choline concentration is due to the collapse of the polypeptide chain into high order aggregates. Calorimetric results show the presence of two populations of C-LytA molecules with a different degree of cooperativity in their tertiary structure in the absence of choline. In spite of the differences in aggregation found between pH 8.0 and 7.0, no significant variation could be observed in the corresponding DSC profiles (data not shown). Upon saturation of choline binding sites, the equilibrium between the different forms of C-LytA is shifted toward the state in which the tertiary structure contacts are intact. The effect induced by choline on DSC thermograms displays a biphasic character. Above 10 mM choline, at the protein concentration used on DSC experiments, C-LytA is a dimer. Its thermal denaturation is more than 80% reversible and can be theoretically described assuming the existence of three cooperative domains (Fig. 5): two identical independent domains, C1, at the edges of the dimer; and a cooperative dimeric block, (C2)2, which dissociates upon denaturation (C2)2 ↔ 2(U2). The low temperature transition in DSC thermograms (ΔH2 = 75 kcal mol-1) corresponds to the melting of C1 domains, while the asymmetric high temperature transition (ΔH3 = 2 × 144 kcal (mol of dimer)-1) corresponds to the (C2)2 domain (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Below 10 mM choline, the first transition observed (Tm1) could be compatible with the existence either of a third domain per monomer or of an unfolding intermediate of C2. Given the low molecular weight of C-LytA, the latter seems the more plausible explanation. The destabilization of the possible intermediate of C2 at high choline concentration would explain the disappearance of the first transition and the concomitant increase of ΔH3 in 30 kcal mol-1. Furthermore, this event is simultaneous to the disappearance of high order aggregates of the denatured form. The biphasic character of choline effects brings about the existence of two different classes of binding sites. The Wyman plot shows that a single molecule per monomer is involved in the ligand-induced dimerization at low choline concentration. However, the slope of the van't Hoff plot (26.Fukada H. Sturtevant J.M. Quiocho F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13193-13198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Hu C.Q. Sturtevant J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) for the Tm3 values as a function of ligand concentration (data not shown) results in a stoichiometry of 4.4 molecules of choline bound/dimer (2.2/monomer). This second molecule of choline could be responsible for the intermediate destabilization, the induction of intersubunit cooperativity, and the reversibility increase. Opposite to C-LytA, more than 80% of LytA forms dimers at 1 mg ml-1 in the absence of ligand. DSC profiles are consistent with the existence of two cooperative domains involving the NH2-terminal module of the protein, N1 and N2 (four per dimer), and domains C1 and (C2)2 previously described in C-LytA (Fig. 5). As in C-LytA, the coupling between the two-state unfolding of (C2)2 and LytA dimer subunit dissociation accounts for the asymmetry of the highest temperature transition (Fig. 1). The thermodynamic parameters derived for the different transitions are reported in Table 1. Transitions 1 and 2 correspond to the melting of the NH2-terminal domains, while 3 and 4 can be assigned to the unfolding of the COOH-terminal domains. The comparison of the thermodynamic parameters of transitions 3 and 4 of LytA with those of transitions 2 and 3 in C-LytA establishes a dependence between the NH2- and the COOH-terminal modules. In this sense, suppression of the NH2-terminal region results in a loosening of the structure of the isolated COOH-terminal module. In addition, cooperativity between monomers through the C2 domain is always observed in LytA, while in C-LytA saturation of the lower affinity binding sites is required. Communication between LytA modules is also derived from the observed interdependence between N1 and N2 domains at high choline concentration, despite the ligand specificity for the COOH-terminal module. On the other hand, the lower reversibility of LytA thermal denaturation suggests that the unfolded NH2-terminal region blocks the renaturation of the whole polypeptide. In spite of the homology in the sequences of the COOH-terminal modules of LytA amidase and CPL1 lysozyme(28.García E. García J.L. García P. Arrarás A. Sánchez-Puelles J.M. López R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 914-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), there are great differences between their structural organization in cooperative domains(29.Sanz J.M. García J.L. Laynez J. Usobiaga P. Menéndez M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 6125-6130Google Scholar). Although both choline-binding modules are designed to improve the attachment of the enzyme to the cell wall, it is obvious that a host-encoded lytic enzyme should exhibit a more efficient regulatory mechanism. In this sense, CPL1 lysozyme is encoded by the bacteriophage Cp1 and its biological regulation should be restricted to the phage cycle. In contrast, LytA amidase is a host-encoded protein involved in cell division of the S. pneumoniae whose activity should be under time and spatial regulation. The choline-modulated dimerization of LytA can be physiologically significant, considering the local concentration of the amidase along the septum(30.Diaz E. García E. Ascaso C. Méndez E. López R. García J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1236-1244Google Scholar), and may play a role on the enzymatic efficiency by increasing the affinity toward the substrate. A lower limit for the free energy of linkage 2The free energy of linkage was calculated as ΔGlink= -RTln (K2L/K2) = −2nRTln (KBD/KBmax), where K2 and K2L are the dimerization constants of free and choline-bound amidase; KBmax and KBD are the average equilibrium constants for binding a choline to the monomer and dimer of LytA, and n is the number of choline binding sites per subunit (see Fig. SI). between dimerization and choline binding of −2.7 kcal mol-1 can be roughly estimated using the dimerization constants of free and choline-bound amidase reported in Table 3(see Fig. SI). Furthermore, upon binding to its natural polymeric substrate, subsequent saturation of free sites after binding the first choline molecule would be an intramolecular process. Therefore, dimerization would further improve the affinity toward the bacterial cell wall, by reducing the loss of entropy associated to ligand binding. Thus, the overall equilibrium constant for dimer binding should be significantly higher than the product of equilibrium constants for binding of two monomers to the same sites. In the in vitro experiments, where choline molecules are discrete entities, this effect cannot operate. However, the local concentration of choline on the cell wall surface, about 16 residues/pneumococcal teichoic acid(31.Fisher N. Berh T. Hartman R. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 32.Formanek H. Hakenbeck R. H ö ltje J.-V. Levichinski H. The Target of Penicillin. W. de Gruyter, Berlin1983: 55-60Crossref Google Scholar), is high enough to allow simultaneous multiple interactions. LytA dimer can be modeled as a prolate ellipsoid of about 13 × 190 Å, which can be visualized as a stalk, made of the COOH-terminal modules, bearing at each end a catalytic site (Fig. 5). This shape would facilitate the diffusion of the molecule through the highly cross-linked framework of the cell wall and increase the number of accessible hydrolyzable bonds per attachment site. On the other hand, dimerization can also facilitate the concomitant interaction with two teichoic acids and the motion of the amidase along the septum by means of a step binding-release mechanism, using the COOH-terminal modules of both subunits, without completely detaching from the cell wall. The finding of two classes of binding sites, with different affinity, per monomer of LytA or C-LytA is in agreement with previous COOH-terminal deletion studies(33.García J.L. Díaz E. Romero A. García P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4066-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 34.Sánchez-Puelles J.M. García J.L. López R. García E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 61: 13-19Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Deletion of the terminal tail of 11 amino acids, responsible for the conversion process, dramatically reduces the catalytic activity. The loss of choline recognition occurs upon additional suppression of P6, P5, and P4 motives, while intermediate deletions have no significant effect. Recently, Markiewicz and Tomasz (35.Markiewicz Z. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2241-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported the presence of a single mole of choline bound per mole of LytA activated by affinity chromatography purification, which dissociates very slowly. This observation is not incompatible with the existence of other types of binding sites, since any molecule of choline bound in fast equilibrium would dissociate after choline depletion of the sample buffer(35.Markiewicz Z. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2241-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The retained choline molecule might be that involved in LytA dimerization, explaining the higher degree of dimerization found in LytA when compared with C-LytA. Nevertheless, there is no experimental evidence supporting a slow monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium. Moreover, the enzyme purified by the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures” is retained again in DEAE-cellulose, after exhaustive dialysis. The previous finding that the activated enzyme was no longer retained by choline-Sepharose columns(35.Markiewicz Z. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2241-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), even after extensive dialysis, may be ascribed to a different local concentration of binding residues in both matrices. The results here reported provide new insights on the molecular structure of pneumococcal autolysins. They establish the absence of a straight forward correspondence between module and structural cooperative domain, as demonstrated by the complex organization of LytA amidase. The NH2- and COOH-terminal modules are organized into independent domains but the influence of choline on LytA stability argues in favor of the existence of communication between modules. The stepwise acquisition of repeating units of the COOH-terminal module may represent an evolution-dictated enzyme advantage related to the existence of several choline-binding sites, which in turn would improve the affinity toward the substrate, as also does the protein dimerization. Finally, the molecular shape of the tail-to-tail dimer would also confer on the system notable properties, by means of a facilitated diffusion and a catalytic site distance constraint. We thank M. V. López Moyano for the excellent technical assistance and Dr. L. Doherty for the careful linguistic revision."

https://openalex.org/W1858356009,"Cytokines, such as interleukin-lβ (IL- lβ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), are thought to be responsible for the compromised blood pressure regulation after systemic infection or other antigenic challenge. Because Ca homeostasis is criti-cal for the maintenance of vascular tone, we hypothesized that cytokines may contribute to alterations in blood pressure by a mechanism involving the voltage-sensitive Ca channel in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells. Using nystatin-permeabilized patch techniques we examined the effects of IL-lβ, TNF-α, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the Ca channel of VSM cells isolated from rat tail artery. Both IL-lβ (0.05-1 nM) and TNF-α (0.1–1 nM) increased, dose-dependently, the Ba2+ current carried in VSM Ca channels, whereas heat-denatured IL-1 β was without significant effect on the channel. LPS (0.01–1.0 ng/ml) also increased the Ba2+ current with onset kinetics similar to the two cytokines. Prostaglandins were ruled out as an intermediary in VSM Ca channel modulation, as prostaglandin E2 had no effect and indomethacin (1 μM) failed to block TNF-α-induced Ca channel enhancement. The role of cyclic nucleotides in mediating TNF-α-induced changes in Ca channel activity was also assessed. Increasing intracellular cAMP via forskolin (1 μM) did not affect the response to TNF-a, but pretreatment with the membrane-permeant analog of cGMP, dibutyryl cGMP (100 μM), inhibited the response to TNF-α. These data demonstrate that IL-lβ, TNF-α, and LPS have immediate effects on VSM cells via an interaction with the voltage-sensitive Ca channel, and these ef-fects may be regulated by intracellular cGMP. Immunomodulation of Ca channels may represent an early signaling step in VSM cells mediating kinetically slower events, such as changes in gene transcription.—Wilkinson, M. F., Earle, M. L., Triggie, C. R., Barnes, S. Interleukin-lβ, tumor necrosis factor-a, and LPS enhance calcium channel current in isolated vascular smooth muscle cells of rat tail artery.

https://openalex.org/W1506739991,"Abstract We report the isolation and structural characterization of an oligo/polysialic acid-containing glycopeptide fraction (designated ESP-Sia) prepared from the egg cell surface complex of the sea urchin, Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus, by exhaustive pronase treatment. The carbohydrate chains isolated from ESP-Sia were shown to consist of O-linked oligo/polysialic acid-containing glycan units and N-linked carbohydrate chains. The present studies have revealed that the O-linked oligo/polysialic acid-containing glycan chains derived from the ESP-Sia were similar to those present in egg jelly coat polysialylated glycoprotein in being composed of tandem repeats of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) glycosidically linked in a novel fashion through the glycolyl group, (5-ONeu5Gcα2). However, they differ from the egg jelly coat in two key respects. First, the average degree of polymerization of the oligo/polysialic acid chains of ESP-Sia is only 3; a value far lower than that found in the jelly coat glycoprotein (average degree of polymerization was about 20). Second, ESP-Sia is uniquely characterized by the presence of 9-O-sulfated N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc9HSO3) residues at the nonreducing termini of the (5-ONeu5Gcα 2) chains. The terminal sialyl residues in the Neu5Gc9HSO3α2(5-ONeu5Gcα2)chains were totally resistant to exosialidases. The discovery of Neu5Gc9HSO3 as the nonreducing terminal residue of oligo/poly(5-ONeu5Gcα 2) group is especially noteworthy in that Neu5Gc9HSO3 appears to be of limited distribution among glycoconjugates. Following the earlier discovery of oligo/polysialic acid chains capped with KDN, i.e. KDNα2(8Neu5Gcα2), found in rainbow trout egg polysialoglycoproteins, it now appears that the sulfated Neu5Gc can serve a similar capping function."

Since the mechanisms of water transport across hepatocytes remain obscure, we performed physiological, molecular, and biochemical studies on hepatocytes to determine if they also contain water channels. Water permeability was studied by exposing isolated rat hepatocytes to buffers of different osmolarity and measuring cell volume by quantitative phase contrast, fluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy. Using this method, hepatocytes exposed to hypotonic buffers at 23°C increased their cell volume in a time and osmolarity-dependent manner with an osmotic water permeability coefficient of 66.4 × 10⁻4 cm/s. In studies done at 10°C, the osmotic water permeability coefficient decreased by 55% (p < 0.001, at 23°C; t test). The derived activation energy from these studies was 12.8 kcal/mol. After incubation of hepatocytes with amphotericin B at 10°C, the osmotic water permeability coefficient increased by 198% (p < 0.001) and the activation energy value decreased to 3.6 kcal/mol, consistent with the insertion of artificial water channels into the hepatocyte plasma membrane. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction with hepatocyte RNA as template did not produce cDNAs for three of the known water channels.

In many cell types, surface receptor activation results in a complex, biphasic Ca2⁺ response composed of an initial mobilization of internally stored Ca2⁺, followed by entry of extracellular Ca2⁺. An early event following activation of the muscarinic receptor is the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate generating the putative second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ((1,4,5)IP3) 1The inositol phosphates are abbreviated according to the “Chilton Convention”(24.Agranoff B.W.

Leslie B.A. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: G99-G105PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the excised glands from five mice (male CD-1; 30-40 g) were finely minced and treated for 1 min with 0.25 mg/10 ml trypsin (Sigma). The trypsin was then removed by centrifugation, followed by a 5-min incubation of the tissue fragments with 2 mg/10 ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), in the presence of 2.5 mM EGTA. Finally, the acinar cells were isolated after treating the tissue with 4 mg/10 ml collagenase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 10 min. Viability of the isolated cells was >95% based on trypan blue exclusion. Throughout, all enzyme solutions were prepared in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Following isolation, the acinar cells were washed and resuspended in sterile Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mM glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 units/ml streptomycin. The cells were then allowed to attach to glass coverslips coated with Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). Acinar cells were incubated on the glass coverslips for at least 3 h before use. The attached cells were mounted in a Teflon chamber (Bionique) and incubated with 0.5 μM fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed and bathed in a HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (HPSS; 120.0 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 11.0 mM glucose, 20.0 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) at room temperature for at least 30 min before Ca2⁺ measurements were made. The fluorescence of the fura-2-loaded cells was monitored with a photomultiplier-based system, mounted on a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a Nikon 40 × (1.3 N.A.) Neofluor objective. The fluorescence light source was provided by a Deltascan D101 (Photon Technology International Ltd.), equipped with a light path chopper and dual excitation monochromators. The light path chopper enabled rapid interchange between two excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm), and a photomultiplier tube monitored the emission fluorescence at 510 nm, selected by a barrier filter (Omega). All experiments were carried out at 24°C. Calibration and calculation of [Ca2⁺]i were carried out as described previously(11.Bird G.S.J. Rossier M.F. Hughes A.R. Shears S.B. Armstrong D.L. Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mouse lacrimal cells were microinjected essentially as described before(11.Bird G.S.J. Rossier M.F. Hughes A.R. Shears S.B. Armstrong D.L. Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A solution consisting of 27 mM K2HPO4, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 26 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.2, and 2 mM fura-2 (acid) was pressure-injected into cells via a glass micropipette attached to a WPI PV830 Picopump (World Precision Instruments, New Haven, CT). Prior to microinjection, lacrimal cells were loaded with fura-2 by incubation with fura-2/AM so that [Ca2⁺]i levels could be monitored prior to and during the microinjection procedure. Isolated cells were suspended in a medium resembling the intracellular milieu, which had the following composition (in mM): 20.0 NaCl, 100.0 KCl, 2.0 MgSO4, 20.0 HEPES (pH 7.2), 1.0 EGTA. Total Ca2⁺ was added so that the free Ca2⁺, calculated as described by Fabiato(14.Fabiato A. Methods. Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar), was 150 nM. The medium also contained an ATP-regenerating system (10 mM phosphocreatine, 10 units/ml creatine kinase) and the mitochondrial inhibitors oligomycin (10 μg/ml) and antimycin (10 μM) when required. Cell permeabilization was achieved by incubation with 50 μg/ml saponin and was complete (>95%) by 10 min as determined by trypan blue exclusion. The permeabilized cells were centrifuged once and resuspended in the intracellular solution lacking saponin for 45Ca2⁺ uptake. The uptake and release of 45Ca2⁺ by permeabilized lacrimal cells were measured as described previously for guinea pig hepatocytes (15.Burgess G.M. McKinney J.S. Fabiato A. Leslie B.A. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15336-15345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Permeabilized cells were incubated with 1 μCi/ml of 45Ca2⁺ at a density of 0.75-1.0 mg/ml of protein, and uptake of 45Ca2⁺ was initiated by the addition of 3 mM-MgATP. Cell content of 45Ca2⁺ was determined by rapidly diluting 200-μl samples of the cell suspension in 5 ml of ice-cold iso-osmotic sucrose (310 mM) containing EGTA (4 mM), and 0.1 μCi of [3H]mannose/ml for determination of trapped volume. The samples were subsequently filtered rapidly through GF/C (Whatman) glass fiber filters and washed with 5 ml of ice-cold iso-osmotic sucrose.

We now show that adhesion affects the sensitivity of RBL cells to the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In suspended cells, PMA inhibited antigen-induced calcium influx (as measured by manganese influx) and changes in intracellular free calcium and had complex effects on antigen-stimulated secretion. However, in adherent cells PMA had little effect on these responses. Suspended cells only secreted in response to thapsigargin if they were co-treated with PMA, while adherent cells secreted in response to thapsigargin alone. The thapsigargin-induced secretion in adherent cells was inhibited by protein kinase C down-regulation and by the protein kinase C inhibitor GF 109203X, but not by calphostin C. We suggest that protein kinase C is constitutively activated in adherent cells, possibly due to modification of the regulatory domain of the enzyme."

We report here that Zn2+ can influence laminin binding activity, in vitro. Laminin contains 42 cysteine-rich repeats of which 12 contained nested zinc finger consensus sequences. Recently, the entactin binding site was mapped to one of these zinc finger-containing repeats on the laminin γ chain (5er, U., Nischt, R., Poschl, E., Mann, K., Fukuda, K., Gerl, M., Yamada, Y., and Timpl, R.(1993) EMBO J. 12, 1879-1885). Based on these observations, the effect of a series of essential ions (Ca2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+) on laminin binding activity was evaluated. Zn2+ was found to be the most effective at enhancing laminin-entactin and laminin-collagen type IV binding. Laminin-bound Zn2+ was detected by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy at a maximum of 8 mol/mol of laminin. Furthermore, Ca2+-dependent laminin polymerization was unaffected by Zn2+, an observation consistent with the lack of zinc finger-containing repeats in the terminal globular domains required for polymerization. We conclude that Zn2+-laminin complexes may generate high affinity binding sites which contribute to BM cross-linking important for its assembly and homeostasis.

Since tyrosine kinase Syk was activated by TPA stimulation, we examined the possibility that cortactin is a potential substrate of Syk in K562 cells. TPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin was decreased profoundly by overexpression of dominant-negative Syk. Furthermore, cortactin was associated with Syk even before TPA stimulation. Since cortactin was previously referred as an 80/85-kilodalton pp60src substrate, we examined the association between Src and cortactin, whereas its association could not be detected.

INTRODUCTIONThe generation of functional cells of the hematopoietic system is a complex process requiring both the constant production of large numbers of differentiated cells and the maintenance of primitive precursor cells. As model systems to investigate the mechanisms of hematopoietic differentiation, several hematopoietic cell lines that can be induced to various cell lineages have been used. In these cell lines, K562 cells, established from a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis(1.Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have a potential to differentiate into a variety of hematopoietic cell lineages(2.Rutherford T.R. Clegg J.B. Weartherall D.J.

Several lines of evidence indicate that this cell line can be differentiated into megakaryocytic lineage by stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) 1The abbreviations used are: TPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisAbantibodymAbmonoclonal antibodyRbretinoblastoma proteinSyk(K⁻)kinase-negative SykSH2Src homology 2.

The expression of platelet glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa) and thromboxane A2 receptor, which have been used as a marker of megakaryocytic differentiation, is strongly enhanced on the surface of K562 cells upon treatment with TPA (11.Tetteroo P.A.

Narumiya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, during TPA induction, nuclear DNA ploidy of these cells is increased to 4-16n simultaneously with an increase in cell volume(13.Leary J.F. Farley B.A. Guiliano R.

Leukemia Res. 1990; 14: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). K562 cells can also be induced to undergo erythroid differentiation by various compounds, including hemin(2.Rutherford T.R. Clegg J.B. Weartherall D.J. Nature. 1979; 280: 164-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). When K562 cells are treated by hemin, the transcription of ζ-, ∈-, γ-, and α-globin mRNA is increased (15.Charnay P. Maniatis T. Science. 1983; 220: 1281-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16.Dean A. Ley T.J. Humphries R.K. Fordis M. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1981; 78: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Evidence has been accumulating that protein tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation play important roles in a variety of processes, leading to cell growth and differentiation in hematopoietic cells. Indeed, K562 cells transfected with c-fes, one of the non-receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinases, undergo myeloid differentiation(18.Yu G. Smithgall T.E. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10276-10281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, erythroid differentiation of these cells can be induced by herbimycin A, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase (19.Honma Y. Okabe-Kado J. Hozumi M. Uehara Y. Mizuno S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 331-334PubMed Google Scholar). A non-receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinase Syk is expressed in almost all the hematopoietic cells. Although the functions of Syk in mast cell, B cell, and platelet activation have been elucidated extensively(20.Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. Cell Signalling. 1995; 7: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), its roles in hematopoietic cell differentiation remain to be addressed. We found here that an 80-kilodalton (kDa) protein, cortactin, is tyrosine-phosphorylated in K562 cells upon TPA treatment, and cortactin associates physically and functionally with Syk. These findings suggest that Syk mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin at an early stage of megakaryocytic differentiation in K562 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureK562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Passages were performed every 3 days when the cells were in exponential phase of growth. The cells were induced to differentiation by adding 10 nM TPA and harvested at the indicated times. The differentiation of stimulated cells was confirmed by Giemsa staining.AntibodiesAntibody (Ab) against porcine Syk was generated by immunizing rabbit with synthesized peptides as described(21.Taniguchi T. Kitagawa H. Yasue S. Yanagi S. Sakai K. Asahi M. Ohta S. Takeuchi F. Nakamura S. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2277-2279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of synthesized peptides to generate anti-porcine Syk Ab is not conserved in human Syk, so this Ab reacts specifically with porcine Syk. Monoclonal Ab (mAb) against human Syk (101) was obtained from Wako Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan. Anti-human retinoblastoma protein (Rb) mAb (G99-2005) was purchased from Pharmingen. Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10), anti-cortactin mAb (anti-p80/85 pp60src substrate, 4F11), and anti-Src mAb (GD11) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.Generation of Dominant-negative MutantA point mutation (Lys395 → Arg) in the ATP binding site of porcine syk cDNA was created by polymerase chain reaction as described(22.Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), and this mutated cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI site of pApuro vector, harboring the chicken actin promoter and puromycin-resistant gene. This plasmid was linearized and transfected into human hematopoietic cell line K562 cells by electroporation using Electroporator II (Invitrogen) at 300 V, 1000 microfarads, and selected in the presence of 1.0 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were cloned by limiting dilution, and the expression of transfected cDNA was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using anti-porcine Syk Ab.Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase AssayCells were sedimented by centrifugation and the pellets were solubilized in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaF, 1 mM vanadate) supplemented with 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysates were incubated with Ab-conjugated protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0. Each sample was incubated in 60 μl of reaction mixture (45 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 10 μM vanadate, 1 μM ATP) containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with 0.2 mg/ml H2B histone or 0.04 mg/ml of acid-treated enolase. After 10 min at 30°C, the reaction was terminated by adding Laemmli SDS sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed using a Fujix imaging analyzer (BAS 2000).To examine the association of Syk with cortactin, digitonin lysis buffer (1% digitonin, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 100 μM vanadate) supplemented with 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml leupeptin was used instead of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. After washing, immunoprecipitates were boiled with Laemmli SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis.Immunoblot AnalysisWhole cell lysates were prepared from nonstimulated or stimulated cells by boiling with Laemmli SDS sample buffer for 3 min. Whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were blocked with 5% milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with primary Ab for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, filters were developed with goat anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit secondary Ab conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.RESULTSTyrosine phosphorylation in K562 cells following TPA stimulation was assessed by immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. Following TPA stimulation, cells were harvested at the indicated times, and whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. As shown in Fig. 1, a protein with molecular mass of 80 kDa was tyrosine-phosphorylated, reaching a maximum within 10 min. Two other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, approximately 160 and 110 kDa, were dephosphorylated with different time courses after TPA stimulation.To identify this 80-kDa protein, we performed immunoblot analysis with several Abs to known phosphoproteins of similar size. Among various Abs tested, we found that this 80-kDa protein migrates to the same mobility as cortactin. Fig. 2A shows immunoblotting of whole cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb or anti-cortactin mAb. By long time development, the lower extra band was visualized. To confirm that this 80-kDa protein is cortactin, immunoblotting of anti-cortactin immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb was carried out. As shown in Fig. 2B, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin was induced by TPA stimulation. The amount of precipitated cortactin did not differ in both samples judging from the immunoblot analysis with anti-cortactin mAb. We next performed depletion experiments with anti-cortactin mAb. TPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 80-kDa protein was not detected following depletion with anti-cortactin Ab, whereas it was not affected by the depletion with same isotype-irrelevant mAb, anti-Rb mAb (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that this 80-kDa protein is identical with cortactin.Figure 2:Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in K562 cells. A, whole cell lysates were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted on membrane. Blotted membrane was cut into two pieces, and one membrane was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb and the other membrane was probed with anti-cortactin mAb. The positions of molecular markers are shown to the left in kDa. The arrowhead indicates the position of the 80-kDa protein.

Reynolds A.B. Papkoff J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2407-2415PubMed Google Scholar), together with the observation that this stimulant activates Syk(21.Taniguchi T. Kitagawa H. Yasue S. Yanagi S. Sakai K. Asahi M. Ohta S. Takeuchi F. Nakamura S. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2277-2279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prompted us to examine the involvement of Syk in TPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in K562 cells. We first examined whether TPA activates Syk in this cell line or not. After TPA stimulation, cells were solubilized with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer at the indicated times, and Syk was immunoprecipitated by anti-human Syk mAb. Then, an in vitro kinase assay was performed with an exogenous substrate H2B histone. Syk kinase activity was increased within 1 min and reached to a maximum at 5 min after TPA stimulation (Fig. 3A). The amount of precipitated Syk did not change throughout the time course judging from the immunoblot analysis with anti-human Syk mAb (Fig. 3B).Figure 3:Activation of Syk kinase in response to addition of TPA. A, K562 cells were stimulated by 10 nM TPA and solubilized at the indicated times. Syk was immunoprecipitated with anti-human Syk mAb and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using H2B histone as an exogenous substrate. B, each immunoprecipitated sample was subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-human Syk mAb. The positions of Syk and H2B histone are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To address the relation between Syk activation and phosphorylation of cortactin in TPA-treated K562 cells, cell lines expressing a dominant-negative mutant form of Syk were established. A point mutation was created in the ATP binding site of porcine syk cDNA, leading to loss of its kinase activity, Syk(K⁻)(22.Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). This mutated cDNA was transfected into K562 cells, and stable transformants were isolated in the presence of puromycin. Expression of mutated porcine Syk was examined by immunoblot analysis with anti-Syk Ab which recognizes only porcine species, and 4 stable transformants were cloned. Fig. 4A shows the expression of mutated porcine Syk in 2 clones of Syk(K⁻) expressing cells. To examine whether overexpression of Syk(K⁻) affects tyrosine phosphorylation in K562 cells, whole cell lysates of stimulated and unstimulated cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. In parental K562 cells, an 80-kDa protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated by TPA stimulation, whereas in 4 transformants expressing Syk(K⁻), this induction was abolished. Fig. 4B shows tyrosine phosphorylation of the 80-kDa protein in parental K562 cells and 2 clones of Syk(K⁻) expressing cells. To confirm that this 80-kDa protein is cortactin, cell lysates from parental K562 cells and transformant expressing Syk(K⁻) were immunoprecipitated by anti-cortactin Ab and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (Fig. 4C). Consistent with a whole cell lysate data, TPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin was not observed in transformant expressing Syk(K⁻). These data demonstrate a strong correlation between Syk activity and TPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin.Figure 4:Expression of kinase-negative Syk in K562 cells. K562 cells were transfected with kinase-negative porcine syk cDNA in which a point mutation was created in the ATP binding site. Transfected cells were selected in the presence of puromycin and cloned by limiting dilution. A, expression of transfected cDNA. Whole cell lysates of wild type K562 (Wt) and 2 clones of Syk(K⁻) transfected cells were analyzed by immunoblot analysis with anti-porcine Syk Ab. B, tyrosine phosphorylation of wild type K562 (Wt) and 2 clones of Syk(K⁻) transfected cells following TPA stimulation. Whole cell lysates of nonstimulated cells and TPA-stimulated cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. Stimulation was performed by adding 10 nM TPA for 20 min. The positions of the molecular markers are shown to the left in kDa. The arrowhead indicates the position of 80 kDa. C, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in wild type and Syk(K⁻) expressing cells. a, cortactin before and after stimulation in these cells was immunoprecipitated, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. b, each immunoprecipitated sample was subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-cortactin mAb. The positions of cortactin and immunoglobulin heavy chain are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To get insights of whether Syk directly or indirectly phosphorylates cortactin upon TPA treatment, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. K562 cells were stimulated and Syk was immunoprecipitated as described in Fig. 3 with a modification that digitonin lysis buffer was used to solubilize cells instead of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-cortactin mAb. As shown in Fig. 5, cortactin was co-immunoprecipitated with Syk both before and after stimulation. The amount of cortactin was not different throughout the time course. Although the isotype of anti-human Syk mAb has not been determined, we conveniently used anti-human Rb mAb for negative control immunoprecipitation to exclude the possibility that cortactin binds nonspecifically to protein A. Co-precipitation of cortactin with Syk was also found when Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer was used to solubilize cell lysates (data not shown), demonstrating that this association is stable. The amount of precipitated Syk did not differ throughout the time course (data not shown). Syk could not be detected in the precipitates with anti-cortactin mAb. One possibility is that as anti-human Syk mAb is not so suitable for immunoblot analysis, we could not detect a small amount of co-precipitated Syk. Another possibility is that the amount of cortactin might be greater than that of Syk in this cell, and cortactin that does not associate with Syk might be present. So, a detectable amount of Syk could not be precipitated with cortactin.Figure 5:Association of cortactin with Syk. K562 cells were stimulated and Syk was immunoprecipitated as described in Fig. 3 with a modification that digitonin lysis buffer was used instead of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-cortactin mAb. For irrelevant Ab negative control, anti-Rb mAb was used. The positions of cortactin and immunoglobulin heavy chain are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since cortactin has been reported to be a potential substrate of Src, we assessed the kinase activity of Src following TPA stimulation in wild type cells and Syk(K⁻) expressing cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, both in K562 cells and transformant expressing Syk(K⁻), autophosphorylation of Src and phosphorylation of enolase were increased after addition of TPA, suggesting that Syk activity does not affect TPA-induced activation of Src. The amount of precipitated Src did not differ in each sample (Fig. 6B). In the same condition for detecting the association of cortactin with Syk, its association with Src could not be detected (data not shown).Figure 6:Activation of Src kinase in response to addition of TPA. A, K562 and Syk(K⁻) expressing cells were stimulated by 10 nM TPA for the indicated times. Src was immunoprecipitated by anti-Src mAb, and in vitro kinase assay was performed with enolase as an exogenous substrate. B, each immunoprecipitated sample was subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Src mAb.

TPA is well known to be an activator of protein kinase C, suggesting that the protein kinase C activates tyrosine kinase(s), leading to the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin.

It was reported that the biological effects by TPA cannot be explained completely by protein kinase C activation in K562 cells(33.Hoffman R. Newlands E.S. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1991; 28: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34.Meichle A. Schutze S. Hensel G. Brunsing D. Kronke M. J. Biol.

It is also possible that TPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is independent of protein kinase C activation.Cortactin was initially described as an 80/85-kilodalton pp60src substrate. It became phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in v-Src-transformed chicken embryo (CE) cells(37.Wu H. Reynold A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In normal cells, cortactin is known to be tyrosine-phosphorylated by various stimulants including growth factors and thrombin(23.Wong S. Reynolds A.B. Papkoff J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2407-2415PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Maa M.C. Wilson L.K. Moyers J.S. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2429-2438PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Durieu-Trautmann O.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since Src is recruited to growth factor receptors possessing tyrosine kinase in those cytoplasmic domains by SH2 domain/phosphotyrosine interactions and consequently activated, it was proposed that cortactin is phosphorylated by this activated Src(40.Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has been noted previously that cortactin could not be detected in Src immunoprecipitates, and involvement of other tyrosine kinase(s) in tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin has been suggested(37.Wu H. Reynold A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 41.Wu H. Parsons J.T. J.

Verhoeven E. Litvinov S. Michalides R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2891-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In platelets, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and activation of Syk were induced by thrombin treatment, although a direct correlation between these events was not clarified. We show here a possibility that cortactin is a substrate of Syk upon TPA stimulation by the following evidence. 1) Syk is activated by TPA stimulation, and, following the activation of Syk, cortactin is tyrosine-phosphorylated. 2) Expression of dominant-negative Syk abolishes the TPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. 3) Cortactin is associated with Syk even before TPA stimulation. Since Src is also activated by TPA stimulation, it is possible that cortactin is a direct substrate of Src in TPA-treated K562 cells. However, in contrast to the association of cortactin with Syk, we could not detect the association of cortactin with Src, suggesting that it is unlikely that Src phosphorylates cortactin directly.An interaction between Syk and Src family protein-tyrosine kinases has been proposed(44.Kurosaki T. Takata M. Yamanashi Y. Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto T. Yamamura H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Coexpression of Src family protein-tyrosine kinases and Syk leads to a remarkable increase in net tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas Src family protein-tyrosine kinases or Syk alone induce only marginal phosphorylation in COS cells. Our finding that TPA-induced Src activation is not affected by overexpression of dominant-negative Syk may exclude the possibility that Syk activates Src kinase activity, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. It would be less possible that Syk and Src are activated independently, considering the close relationship between Syk and Src or Src and cortactin. Src might be upstream to Syk.As mentioned, TPA treatment of K562 cells induces the increase of nuclear DNA ploidy and cell volume. Cortactin is concentrated in a cytoskeleton-associated structure that is rich in focal adhesion proteins(37.Wu H. Reynold A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Since cortactin is able to associate with F-actin through its tandem helix-turn-helix domain(41.Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), it may be conceivable that cortactin is involved in this TPA-mediated morphological change.Cortactin is related to a putative transcriptional factor HS1(45.Yamanashi Y. Okada M. Semba T. Yamori T. Umemori H. Tsunasawa S. Toyoshima K. Kitamura D. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3631-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This protein is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and functions as a major substrate of protein-tyrosine kinase(s) involved in B-cell antigen receptor-mediated signaling. Tyrosine-phosphorylated HS1 is demonstrated to be localized mainly in nucleus, proposing the idea that HS1 is translocated from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus through its phosphorylation(46.Benhamou L.E. Watanabe T. Kitamura D. Cazenave P.A. Sarthou P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1993-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 47.Taniuchi I. Kitamura D. Maekawa Y. Fukuda T. Kishi H. Watanabe T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3664-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similarly, cortactin may be transported to the nucleus through its tyrosine phosphorylation where it may be involved in nuclear events such as transcriptional regulation, leading to differentiation into megakaryocytic lineage. Although these notions await further investigation, the present study demonstrates that cortactin may be the substrate of Syk rather than Src. INTRODUCTIONThe generation of functional cells of the hematopoietic system is a complex process requiring both the constant production of large numbers of differentiated cells and the maintenance of primitive precursor cells. As model systems to investigate the mechanisms of hematopoietic differentiation, several hematopoietic cell lines that can be induced to various cell lineages have been used. In these cell lines, K562 cells, established from a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis(1.Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have a potential to differentiate into a variety of hematopoietic cell lineages(2.Rutherford T.R. Clegg J.B. Weartherall D.J.

Several lines of evidence indicate that this cell line can be differentiated into megakaryocytic lineage by stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) 1The abbreviations used are: TPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisAbantibodymAbmonoclonal antibodyRbretinoblastoma proteinSyk(K⁻)kinase-negative SykSH2Src homology 2.

The expression of platelet glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa) and thromboxane A2 receptor, which have been used as a marker of megakaryocytic differentiation, is strongly enhanced on the surface of K562 cells upon treatment with TPA (11.Tetteroo P.A.

Narumiya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, during TPA induction, nuclear DNA ploidy of these cells is increased to 4-16n simultaneously with an increase in cell volume(13.Leary J.F. Farley B.A. Guiliano R. Kosciolek B.A. La Bella S. Rowley P.T. J. Biol. Regul. Homeostatic Agents. 1987; 1: 73-80PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Alitalo R. Leukemia Res. 1990; 14: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). K562 cells can also be induced to undergo erythroid differentiation by various compounds, including hemin(2.Rutherford T.R. Clegg J.B. Weartherall D.J. Nature. 1979; 280: 164-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). When K562 cells are treated by hemin, the transcription of ζ-, ∈-, γ-, and α-globin mRNA is increased (15.Charnay P. Maniatis T. Science. 1983; 220: 1281-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16.Dean A. Ley T.J. Humphries R.K. Fordis M. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1981; 78: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Evidence has been accumulating that protein tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation play important roles in a variety of processes, leading to cell growth and differentiation in hematopoietic cells. Indeed, K562 cells transfected with c-fes, one of the non-receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinases, undergo myeloid differentiation(18.Yu G. Smithgall T.E. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10276-10281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, erythroid differentiation of these cells can be induced by herbimycin A, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase (19.Honma Y. Okabe-Kado J. Hozumi M. Uehara Y. Mizuno S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 331-334PubMed Google Scholar). A non-receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinase Syk is expressed in almost all the hematopoietic cells. Although the functions of Syk in mast cell, B cell, and platelet activation have been elucidated extensively(20.Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. Cell Signalling. 1995; 7: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), its roles in hematopoietic cell differentiation remain to be addressed. We found here that an 80-kilodalton (kDa) protein, cortactin, is tyrosine-phosphorylated in K562 cells upon TPA treatment, and cortactin associates physically and functionally with Syk. These findings suggest that Syk mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin at an early stage of megakaryocytic differentiation in K562 cells."

IGFBP-5, the most conserved of six IGFBPs characterized to date, uniquely potentiates the anabolic actions of IGF-I for skeletal cells. In osteoblasts, IGFBP-5 production is stimulated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a local factor that mediates certain effects induced by parathyroid hormone, cytokines such as interleukin-1 and transforming growth factor-β, and mechanical strain. In this study, we show that transcriptional and post-transcriptional events initiated by PGE2 collaborate to enhance IGFBP-5 gene expression in primary fetal rat osteoblast cultures. PGE2 treatment stimulated up to a 7-fold rise in steady-state levels of IGFBP-5 mRNA throughout 32 h of incubation. Analysis of nascent IGFBP-5 mRNA suggested that PGE2 had only a modest stimulatory effect on IGFBP-5 gene transcription, and transient transfection studies with IGFBP-5 promoter-reporter genes confirmed that PGE2 enhanced promoter activity by ~2-fold. Similar stimulatory effects were seen with forskolin.

Chem. 1989; 264: 18726-18732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A specific deficiency in the laminin Am chain has been associated with the dystrophic dy mutation in mice(9.Sunada Y.

Furthermore, other laminin-related proteins have been reported(11.Frenette G. Carey T. Varani J. Schwartz D. Fligiel S. Ruddon R. Peters B.

Various heterotrimers can be assembled from the different laminin subunits(16.Engvall E. Earwicker D. Haaparanta T. Ruoslahti E. Sanes J.R.

Another nomenclature for the protein chains has also been proposed recently; in this nomenclature, the laminin B1 protein is called β1 and the gene is LAMB1(18.Burgeson R.E. Chiquet M. Deutzmann R.

During early mouse embryogenesis, mRNAs for the B1 and B2 chains of laminin were detected from the 4-cell stage, while the A chain appeared at the 16-cell stage(27.Cooper A.R. MacQueen H.A. Dev. Biol. 1983; 96: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 28.Dziadek M. Timpl R. Dev. Biol. 1985; 111: 372-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). During the period of mouse development in which major organs are forming, laminin was detected in the basement membranes of epithelial cells(29.Klein G. Ekblom M. Fecker L. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Development. 1990; 110: 823-837PubMed Google Scholar), during intestinal development(30.Simo P. Simon-Assmann P. Bouziges F. Leberquier C. Kedinger C. Ekblom P. Sorokin L.

Walker R.A. Varley J.M. Development. 1988; 104: 431-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conversion of mesenchyme to epithelium in kidney is accompanied first by an increase in laminin B1 and B2 transcripts (31.Senior P.V. Critchley D.R. Beck F. Walker R.A. Varley J.M.

The α1/β1 and α6/β1 integrin heterodimers have been shown to mediate cell attachment to distinct sites on laminin (33.Hall D.E. Reichardt I.F. Crowley E. Holley B. Moezzi H. Sonnenberg A. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2175-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The α6/β1 laminin receptor is also regulated during development both by its level of expression and via phosphorylation (34.de Curtis I. Reichardt L.F.

In cultured neuroepithelial cells, basic fibroblast growth factor enhances the amount of laminin expressed at the protein level(37.Drago J. Nurcombe V. Pearse M.J. Murphy M. Bartlett P.F. Exp. Cell. Res. 1991; 196: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). During myogenic differentiation, the expression of several different laminin chains is increased(38.Kroll T.G. Peters B.P.

Retinoic acid, a member of the vitamin A family of signaling molecules called retinoids, induces laminin expression in cultured murine embryonic teratocarcinoma stem cells such as the F9 cell line which is induced to differentiate into parietal endoderm cells(39.Strickland S.

Further studies by this laboratory demonstrated that the RA-mediated regulation of the expression of the LAMB1 gene occurred primarily at the transcriptional level(46.Gudas L.J. Grippo J.F. Kim K.W.

Cyclic AMP analogs were shown to augment the transcriptional response of the cells to retinoic acid, but cyclic AMP analogs alone did not enhance the rate of transcription of this gene(44.Wang S.-Y.

An RARE (retinoic acid response element) was identified at position −477 to −432 in the promoter region of the murine LAMB1 gene, and this response element is recognized by retinoic acid receptors (RARs)(48.Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 49.Vasios G.W. Mader S. Gold J.D. Leid M. Lutz Y. Gaub M.-P. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1149-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the targeted disruption of both copies of the RARγ gene in F9 cells led to a defect in the RA-associated activation of the LAMB1 gene(1.Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9601-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This suggested that the LAMB1 gene was a target gene regulated by the RARγ. However, the late induction of the LAMB1 gene and the observation that the RA-mediated induction was prevented by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (50.Wang S.-Y. Gudas L.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 136: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) indicated that other RA-inducible transcription factors were involved in the regulation of the expression of the LAMB1 gene. In this manuscript, we present a more detailed analysis of the regulation of the LAMB1 gene in response to retinoic acid. F9 cells were cultured as previously reported (48.Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). F9 cells were induced to differentiate in the presence of RA or RACT as described previously(51.Hu L. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 391-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The F9 RARα-/- and RARγ-/- cell lines were cultured as described by Boylan et al.(1.Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A λEMBL library (obtained from Dr. Anton Berns) containing murine 129SV genomic DNA was used for the isolation of LAMB1 genomic clones. The screening protocol was that of Sambrook et al.(53.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A total of 8 × 105 phage clones were screened by hybridization with a 2.3-kb HindIII/BamHI probe covering from −3961 to −1614 bp of the murine LAMB1 gene; this phage clone was identified previously in this laboratory(48.Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Four positive phage clones were further screened and purified as described by Sambrook et al.(53.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Clones containing genomic LAMB1 inserts were mapped by a series of restriction enzyme digestions. The construction of pL −3136/-2736TKCAT was accomplished by cloning a 400-bp DraI/HincII murine genomic fragment (DraI converted to HindIII) into pBLCAT2(54.Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The plasmids 0.13LAMCAT, p0.49LAMCAT, and p3.9LAMCAT were described previously(48.Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The plasmids p2.8LAMCAT, p3.4LAMCAT, and p3.6LAMCAT were constructed by J. D. Gold in this laboratory. The murine RARγ expression plasmid, and pβ-actin-lacZ were previously described(48.Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Footprinting probes were prepared by 5′ end labeling of DNA restriction fragments with a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and isolated after secondary restriction enzyme digestion(56.Cereghini S. Raymondjean M. Carranca A.G. Herbomel P. Yaniv M. Cell. 1987; 50: 627-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Markers were prepared by chemical sequencing reactions(57.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting assays were performed as described by Lichtsteiner et al.(58.Lichtsteiner S. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Cell. 1987; 51: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The DNase I enzyme (molecular biology grade, from bovine pancreas) was purchased from Worthington Corp. EMSA analysis was performed according to Ausubel et al.(59.Ausubel F.M. Roger B. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). The wild type and mutant laminin B1 probes are described in Fig. 6D. A nonspecific oligonucleotide was also used (sequence is written 5′ to 3′): GGTGGAGATCCAACAGCATCCTTAATTAAGTTCC. Transient transfections, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays, and mapping of DNase I-hypersensitive sites were performed as described previously(48.Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 60.Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Prior research had identified an RARE at position −477 to −432 in the murine LAMB1 promoter(48.Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 49.Vasios G.W. Mader S. Gold J.D. Leid M. Lutz Y. Gaub M.-P. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1149-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), but LAMB1 promoter constructs containing this RARE did not fully recapitulate the pattern of expression of the LAMB1 gene during the RA-induced differentiation process. The LAMB1 promoter constructs containing the RARE were RA-responsive in transient transfection assays within 12-24 h after RA addition, whereas the endogenous LAMB1 gene was transcriptionally activated only 24-48 h after RA addition. Moreover, there was no augmentation of the RA response by cyclic AMP analogs using these LAMB1/CAT constructs in transient transfection assays (48.Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). 3C. Li and L. J. Gudas, unpublished data. To locate additional cis control regions that could regulate the transcription of the LAMB1 gene in F9 cells during the differentiation process, the murine LAMB1 gene was assayed for DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSS). Nuclei were prepared from untreated F9 stem cells or from cells cultured in the presence of RA for 24 or 72 h. The 72-h time point was chosen because, at 72 h, the LAMB1 gene is maximally activated by RA. To map any DHSS 5′ of the gene, DNA purified from DNase I-treated nuclei was digested with ApaI, and the resulting Southern blot was hybridized to a 466-bp SacII/ApaI probe covering −353 to +113 bp of the mouse LAMB1 gene (Fig. 1A). This experiment showed that several DHSS were present in the 15-kb genomic LAMB1 ApaI fragment. A band of 8 kb (DHSS3) that is located approximately −8 kb from the transcription initiation site was observed in DNA from nuclei treated with RA for both 24 and 72 h, reflecting an RA-inducible hypersensitive site (Fig. 1, A and B). DNA from the 72-h RA-treated F9 cells, but not from the 24-h RA-treated F9 cells, was cleaved at an additional site that is located approximately −2.9 kb from the transcription initiation site, resulting in an additional band of approximately 3 kb (DHSS2) (Fig. 1, A and B). Similar DHSS were observed in nuclei from F9 cells cultured in the presence of RACT (1 × 10⁻6M RA plus 250 μM dibutyryl cyclic AMP and 500 μM theophylline (data not shown)). To identify any DHSS closer to the initiation of transcription of the LAMB1 gene, DNA from DNase I-treated nuclei was digested with HindIII, analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and the resulting Southern blot was hybridized to a 538-bp HindIII/SpeI fragment containing −3961 to −3423 bp of mouse LAMB1 gene (Fig. 1A). Digestion of DNA in nuclei from untreated F9 stem cells resulted in a band of 3.7 kb (DHSS1) that maps to about −260 bp from the transcription initiation site. While this site, DHSS1, is located relatively close to the LAMB1 RARE(48.Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), this site was observed only in nuclei from stem cells and was not observed in DNA from nuclei of 24-h and 72-h RA-treated F9 cells (data not shown). Overall, we have examined a total of 18 kb of genomic DNA at the 5′ end of the murine LAMB1 gene. Three RA-sensitive DHSS were observed. DHSS1 is detected in F9 stem cells but is not observed after 24 h or 72 h of RA treatment. DHSS2 is observed only after 72 h of culture in the presence of RA, while DHSS3 is observed after both 24 h and 72 h of RA treatment. Because the DHSS2 was observed only at later times after RA addition (72 h), we concentrated on the further delineation of this site since its properties reflected the pattern of expression of the endogenous LAMB1 gene. Four phage clones that contained mouse LAMB1 genomic DNA were isolated by screening a mouse genomic library with a 2.3-kb HindIII/BamHI probe covering from −3961 to −1614 bp of the LAMB1 gene. From a total of 8 × 105 phage clones that were screened, 4 phage clones resulted in positive hybridization signals. In order to define the regulatory elements in the DHSS 2 region of the murine LAMB1 gene in greater detail, the series of LAMB1 promoter/CAT constructs indicated in Fig. 2A were transfected into F9 cells, and this transfection was followed by treatment of the cells with RA for 24 h. For the 72-h time point, the cells were cultured in the presence of RA for 48 h, and then the cells were transiently transfected. This transfection was followed by further culture in the presence of RA for an additional 24 h. The results of these transient transfection assays indicated that all of the LAMB1 promoter/CAT constructs except the p0.13LAMCAT construct exhibited an increase in activity after 24 h of RA treatment (Fig. 2B). These results confirmed previous work by Vasios et al.(48.Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 49.Vasios G.W. Mader S. Gold J.D. Leid M. Lutz Y. Gaub M.-P. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1149-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) which demonstrated that the p0.49LAMCAT construct which contains the RARE was RA-responsive by 24 h after RA addition. Further increases in CAT activity were observed after 72 h of RA treatment for most of the LAMB1/CAT constructs (Fig. 2B). Deletion of a 569-bp fragment containing the DHSS2 from the 5′ end of p3.4LAMCAT resulted in much less additional CAT activity at 72 h versus 24 h (Fig. 2B). Taken together, the DNase I hypersensitivity data indicating the location of DHSS2 at about −2.9 kb, and the results of these transient transfection assays are consistent with the hypothesis that the region of the LAMB1 promoter between −2.8 kb and −3.4 kb contains a DNA regulatory site which is more active at later times (72 h) after RA treatment than at 24 h. To determine whether the DHSS2 region could be recognized specifically by nuclear proteins, in vitro footprinting studies were performed with various subfragments of the 687-bp fragment covering the DHSS2 region. Three protected regions (FP2892, FP2860, and FP2821) were observed with the extract of 72-h RA-treated F9 cells (Fig. 3A). The footprint locations and sequences are shown in the diagram in Fig. 3B. Thus, specific regions of the LAMB1 promoter could be footprinted, but the footprinting data did not indicate any differences between RA 24-h extracts (data not shown) and RA 72-h extracts. Since EMSA is more sensitive and quantitative, we next examined this region of the LAMB1 gene using EMSA. To characterize further individual protein-binding sites within the footprinted regions, EMSA was performed with double-stranded, labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to P2892, P2860, and P2821. With extracts from untreated F9 stem cells, two retarded bands, complexes C1 and C3, were observed when probe P2860 was tested (Fig. 4A). In extracts from F9 cells treated for 24 h with RA, both retarded complexes C1 and C3 were again observed. Moreover, a small amount of a new complex C2 was detected at 24 h. In extracts from cells treated with RA for 72 h, a large amount of the complex C2 was observed, whereas the C1 complex was absent (Fig. 4A). Strikingly, when extracts from cells treated with RACT were examined, the C2 retarded complex was very abundant in extracts from both the earlier time point, 24 h, and the 72-h time point (Fig. 4A). Similar enhancement was observed when another cyclic AMP analog, 8-bromocyclic AMP, was used in combination with RA treatment to generate extracts for EMSA (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the C2 complex represents a protein•DNA complex which is very abundant at 72 h in the presence of RA alone, but which is present at high levels at both 24 and 72 h when extracts are made from cells treated with RACT. The C2 complex may be functionally significant, therefore, since we also see earlier and more intense transcriptional activation of the LAMB1 gene in the presence of RACT than in the presence of RA alone(47.Hosler B.A. LaRosa G.J. Grippo J.F. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5623-5629Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Analysis using the probe P2821 identified a single major retarded complex, C3 (Fig. 4B). The C3 complex is slightly more abundant in extracts from cells treated with RA for 24 h and in extracts treated with RACT for 24 h (Fig. 4B). Thus, while this C3 complex is present in nuclei from RA-treated cells, it is also present at significant levels in extracts from untreated F9 stem cells. From mutation studies described later in the manuscript (Fig. 6), the C3 complex observed with probe P2821 appears to be identical with the C3 complex ob"

A recent study of DNA sequences recognized by Lrp established the consensus as a 15-bp sequence, YAGHAWATTWTDCTR (Y = C/T, H = “not G,” W = A/T, D =“not C,” R = A/G) (Cui, Y., Wang, Q., Stormo, G.

A double-stranded 15 mer having a sequence that closely matches the consensus does not show measurable binding to Lrp. One or two base pairs of DNA flanking each end are not sufficient for binding, but constructs having 3-5 additional base pairs (21 mer) show relatively strong binding. Single-stranded flanking DNA also contributes to strong binding. The extent of the contribution to binding is dependent upon whether the single strand is on the left or right of the double-stranded region and whether the polarity of the single-stranded DNA is 5′ to 3′ or 3′ to 5′.

D'Ari R. Lin R.T. Cell. 1992; 68: 617-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and (2.Calvo J.M. Matthews R.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 466-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). It acts negatively to reduce expression of some operons and positively to increase expression of others. In general, Lrp appears to stimulate expression of operons that function in biosynthetic pathways and to repress expression of those that function in catabolic pathways. In addition, the expression of many Lrp-related operons is affected by L-leucine. In some cases, leucine overcomes the effect of Lrp, in other cases it is required for the effect, and in yet other cases it does not seem to influence the effect of Lrp(1.Newman E.B. D'Ari R.

Lrp has a monomer molecular mass of 18.8 kDa, and at a concentration of 10 μM it exists as a dimer in solution(3.Willins D.A. Ryan C.W. Platko J.V. Calvo J.M. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1993; 7: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) has been studied by DNase I footprinting. In each case, Lrp perturbs the structure of DNA over a region of 100 bp or more. For the case of ilvIH, Lrp binds to six distinct sites, and the binding is highly cooperative to two groups of those sites(10.Wang Q. Calvo J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Lrp induces a bend of about 50° in binding to a single site(5.Wang Q. Calvo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A preliminary consensus sequence was derived from a comparison of 12 sites to which Lrp was shown to bind in MPE footprinting experiments (11.Wang Q. Sacco M. Ricca E. Lago C.T. DeFelice M. Calvo J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). That consensus sequence was confirmed and extended by analyzing 63 sequences obtained using the “Selex” procedure of Tuerk and Gold (12.Cui Y. Wang Q. Stormo G.D. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4872-4880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8004) Google Scholar). The consensus, YAGHAWATTWTDCTR (Y = C/T, H =“not G,” W = A/T, D =“not C,” R = A/G), is 15 bp in length and is palindromic in part. The central 5 bp are predominantly ATs, with the As distributed mostly on one strand and the Ts on the other. Here we investigate further the requirements for Lrp interaction with a single binding site. We demonstrate that a double-stranded 15 mer having a sequence that closely matches the consensus does not bind Lrp and that flanking DNA sequences are required for strong binding. Surprisingly, single-stranded DNA in some cases provides the extra energy required for strong binding. In addition, we performed stoichiometry experiments that demonstrate that a single Lrp binding site binds one Lrp dimer. The DNA fragment used was one of the six binding sites for Lrp that is located upstream of the ilvIH operon of E. coli (site 2). Two complementary single strands were chemically synthesized: 5′-TCGAACATGAATGTCTGGTTTATTCTGCATT-3′ and 3′-TGTACTTACAGTCCAAATAAGACGTAAGATC-5′. Three μg of each strand were annealed by heating to 97°C in a 100-μl solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM sodium EDTA, and 100 mM NaCl followed by cooling slowly. End-labeled fragments were prepared with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp., 3000 Ci/mmol) using reverse transcriptase. Unincorporated label was removed by twice diluting the sample to 2 ml followed by concentration to 35 μl with an Amicon Centricon 10 filter. The specific activity of the DNA fragment was determined as follows. The amount of DNA in a sample was measured with a DNA fluorometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, TKO 100) following the procedure described by the manufacturer. The amount of radioactivity in samples of DNA was determined by adding each sample to 0.35 cm3 of 8% polyacrylamide gel (previously electrophoresed at 14 V/cm for 2.5 h), incubating at 65°C overnight with 0.5 ml of 21% H2O2 and 17% HClO4 in a capped scintillation vial(14.Yang C. Nash H.A. Cell. 1989; 57: 869-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and counting with 15 ml of biodegradable counting scintillant (Amersham) using a Beckman 7500 liquid scintillation counter. Radioactive Lrp was prepared by in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [3H]leucine. Plasmid pCV225, containing the lrp gene downstream of a phage T7 promoter, was constructed as follows. The lrp gene from plasmid pCV180 (15.Platko J.V. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cut out with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned between the same sites of plasmid pYFC-0 (a derivative of pBS II SK⁺, in which the lac operator was deleted)(16.Chen Y. Helmann J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5123-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCV225 was isolated from strain CV1211 (JM101/pCV225) and purified by CsCl centrifugation(17.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. I. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.42-1.43Google Scholar). Lrp was synthesized in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 1 μg of plasmid pCV225 DNA, 134 pmol of L-[4,5-3H]leucine (Amersham, 149 Ci/mmol), 1 μl of a solution containing a mixture of all of the amino acids except leucine (each at 1 mM), 1 μl of a solution containing T7 RNA polymerase, and 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte extract. All of the components except leucine and DNA were from the TNT T7 coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system of Promega. After 90 min at 30°C, unincorporated leucine was removed by passing the sample through a spin column containing 250 μl of Sephadex G-50 swollen in TG20ED (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM DTT). This column was centrifuged at 850 × g for 1 min, and the flow-through volume containing Lrp was collected. The specific activity of Lrp was calculated as the product: specific activity [3H]Leu (dpm/pmol) × 23 pmol of Leu/pmol of Lrp. The specific activity of the leucine had to be corrected because of the unradiolabled leucine in the rabbit reticulocyte extract. To do this, a 25-μl sample of the reticulocyte lysate was added to 25 μl of 30% CH3OH, and after dilution to 1 ml with 20% CH3OH, the sample was passed through an equilibrated C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge. The eluate was dried under vacuum, dissolved in 100 μl of 0.1 M of HCl, and assayed for amino acids with a Beckman amino acid analyzer. The efficiency of the scintillation counter for counting tritium was determined by measuring cpm for samples of [3H]leucine (149 Ci/mmol) that had been added to samples of polyacrylamide gel and treated with peroxide and perchlorate as described above. In a typical experiment to determine stoichiometry, a 100-μl solution containing 40% glycerol, 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 μg of bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.4 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, and about 1.5 pmol of end-labeled site 2 was mixed with 100 μl of the sample containing tritiated Lrp. After 20 min at 20°C, the sample was distributed into five wells and fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1.5-mm 8% polyacrylamide gel for 2.5 h at 14 V/cm. The Lrp•DNA complex in each lane identified by autoradiography was excised in a volume of 0.35 cm3 and counted as described above using Beckman program 6. Channel 1 was used to measure tritium counts/min after corrections were made for spillover of 32P (approximately 4% of channel 2 counts). Channel 2 was used to measure 32P with no correction for tritium spillover necessary. Stoichiometry was determined from the following equation: [cpm 3H × specific activity of DNA (cpm/pmol)]/[cpm 32P × 3H efficiency (cpm/dpm) × specific activity of Lrp (dpm/pmol)]. Molecular weights were determined by electrophoresis through native polyacrylamide gels using procedures described by Orchard and 5(18.Orchard K. May G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3335-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The DNA used was Lrp binding site 2 that is at position −232 to −211 upstream of the E. coli ilvIH promoter(10.Wang Q. Calvo J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Binding reactions prepared as for band shift assays and containing 12 ng of Lrp and 32P-labeled DNA were analyzed on a series of pre-run polyacrylamide gels (5-10%; 40:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide; 15 cm × 18 cm; cast and run in 22 mM Tris borate buffer containing 0.6 mM EDTA). Electrophoresis was performed in a cold room at 12 V/cm until the bromphenol blue dye reached the bottom of the gel. Protein standards (about 1 μg of each protein, Sigma) were run in parallel. The centers of the bromphenol blue bands were marked with radioactive ink and by punching, respectively, for the Lrp•DNA complex and the protein standard lanes. Lanes containing label were dried onto paper and subjected to autoradiography, whereas lanes containing protein standards were stained with Coomassie Blue. The distance migrated by Lrp•DNA complexes and by each standard were measured and divided by the distance that the bromphenol blue in the same lane migrated, giving relative mobilities, Rf. The logarithm of Rf was plotted against the percent gel concentration for each species, and then the slope of each protein standard was plotted against its molecular weight on a log-log scale. An Lrp derivative having 12 extra amino acids at the NH2 terminus, including 6 His residues (6XHis-Lrp) was made by using the QIAexpress system (Qiagen, Inc.). The coding region of lrp was amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction, cloned into vector pQE30, and the resulting hybrid plasmid was transformed into strain JM101. 6XHis-Lrp was overexpressed after induction with isopropylthiogalactoside and purified using a Ni-NTA affinity column. 2Y. Cui and J. M. Calvo, unpublished results. 6XHis-Lrp shows similar DNA binding activity as wild type (data not shown). Following the procedure of Hager and Burgess(19.Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), heterodimers were prepared by mixing 1 μl of 6XHis-Lrp (6 μg/μl), 3 μl of Lrp (1 μg/μl), and 20 μl of 8 M guanidine hydrochloride, all in TG10ED, 0.1 M NaCl, and incubating at room temperature for 1 h. The sample was diluted with 1 ml of TG10ED, 0.1 M NaCl, and after incubation for an additional 5 h, 1 μl was used in binding reactions. Electrophoresis was performed through 38-cm long 8% polyacrylamide gels at 10 V/cm for 15 h at room temperature. 5′−GATCGAAGCTTGTCCCATAGCATAATATTCTCCTTACGCTCTAGACGCAT−3′(F)TAGCATAATATTCTCATAGCATAATATTCTCCCATAGCATAATATTCTCCTCCATAGCATAATATTCTCCTTCCCATAGCATAATATTCTCCTTATCCCATAGCATAATATTCTCCTTAC3′−CTAGCTTCGAACAGGGTATCGTATTATAAGAGGAATGCGAGATCTGCGTA−5′(R)ATCGTATTATAAGAGTATCGTATTATAAGAGGGTATCGTATTATAAGAGGAGGTATCGTATTATAAGAGGAAGGGTATCGTATTATAAGAGGAATAGGGTATCGTATTATAAGAGGAATGScheme 1 The oligonucleotides synthesized are shown in Fig. S1. Complementary sequences F and R comprise a double-stranded 50 mer that bound Lrp most strongly from a collection of 63 sequences that were selected in vitro for binding to Lrp (Leu-19 in (12.Cui Y. Wang Q. Stormo G.D. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4872-4880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The underlined region corresponds to the 15-bp consensus sequence that was defined by a comparison of the 63 sequences(12.Cui Y. Wang Q. Stormo G.D. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4872-4880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To form duplex DNA, equimolar amounts of complementary strands were added to 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, heated to 95°C for 5 min, and cooled slowly to room temperature. For the primer extension experiments, the strategy and procedures of Liu-Johnson et al.(20.Liu-Johnson H.N. Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) were used with some modifications. The Sequenase sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was used for primer extension reactions. Primers were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (17.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. I. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.42-1.43Google Scholar) and purified by ethanol precipitation after phenol/chloroform extraction. They were hybridized to their templates in a 1:2 molar ratio in 1 × Sequenase buffer by heating at 70°C for 10 min and cooling to room temperature slowly. About 50 pmol of product were mixed with 1 μl of DTT, 1 μl of Mn buffer, and 0.5 μl of Sequenase 2.0 in a total volume of 15.5 μl. Then 3.5-μl samples were transferred to four tubes containing 2.5 μl of dideoxynucleotide (ddNTP) termination mixes and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The extension products from all four reactions were pooled, extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH8.0), 1 mM EDTA. To avoid denaturation from ethanol precipitation(21.Svaren J. Inagami S. Lovegren E. Chalkley R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 21: 8739-8754Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the products were boiled for 2 min, chilled immediately on ice for 2 min, heated to 70°C for 10 min, and cooled slowly to room temperature. Binding reactions in a total volume of 40 μl were performed as described by Wang and Calvo (10.Wang Q. Calvo J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (no competitor DNA) using Lrp at final dimer concentrations of 8.3 or 16.6 nM and a final DNA concentration of 100 nM (based upon the concentration of primer). The sample was incubated at room temperature for 20 min, fractionated through an 8% polyacrylamide gel in the cold, and subjected to autoradiography. Regions of the gel containing DNA-Lrp complex and free DNA were excised, and DNA was eluted and ethanol precipitated. These preparations were fractionated on a 12% sequencing gel. The primer extension products from the four reactions were run alongside to identify the sequences. The radioactivity of each band was quantified with a Betascope blot analyzer (Betagen). In other experiments, DNA samples were labeled and incubated with Lrp as described above except that samples were separated through 8% polyacrylamide gels in the cold to avoid denaturing short duplexes. In some cases, the amount of free DNA and Lrp•DNA complex were measured over a range of Lrp concentrations and binding constants were calculated as the concentration of Lrp at which half of the DNA existed as complex. In other cases, binding constants were determined relative to that for the double-stranded 50 mer using the equation K = (C/D) × 1/(Pt - C), where K is the binding constant, C and D are the band intensities of the complex and free DNA, respectively, and Pt is the total protein concentration. For these experiments, the DNA concentration was 5 nM, and the Lrp concentration was either 16.6 nM (Figure 6:, Figure 7:) or 8.3 nM (Fig. 8). Where relative binding strengths are reported, the binding constant for a particular construct was divided by that for the double-stranded 50 mer construct, determined in the same experiment.Figure 6:Lrp binding as a function of the number of base pairs flanking the consensus.

Calvo J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The sequence of site 2 closely matches the consensus sequence for Lrp binding, and Lrp binds to a 31 mer containing this sequence with a Kd in the nanomolar range(12.Cui Y. Wang Q. Stormo G.D. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4872-4880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We employed 32P-labeled site 2 DNA and 3H-labeled Lrp, both of known specific activity, and measured the amounts of each label in an Lrp•DNA complex that was isolated after electrophoresis. The results of three determinations (monomers per DNA) were 2.2, 2.06, and 2.3 (average 2.18). These results establish the empirical formula of the complex to be DnP2n where D is DNA, P is protein monomer, and n is an integer. Establishing the value of n requires an estimate of the molecular weight of the complex. This was provided by measuring the electrophoretic mobility of Lrp•DNA complexes through native acrylamide gels of different porosities (Ferguson plots)(18.Orchard K. May G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3335-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the mobility versus percent acrylamide concentration for each of the standards used (globular proteins of molecular mass 14.2-132 kDa), and in Fig. 1B the slopes of each curve are plotted against the respective molecular mass. Lrp•DNA complexes, analyzed together with standards in the same gels, behaved like proteins having a molecular mass of 65 kDa. This result establishes the stoichiometry as D1P2 (molecular mass = 58 kDa) rather than D2P4 (molecular mass = 116 kDa). The fact that the experimentally determined molecular mass of the complex was higher than the calculated value (65 versus 58 kDa) may be due to differences in shape between the standards employed (globular proteins) and the sample (DNA-protein complex). The conclusion that two Lrp monomers bind to a single site was confirmed by employing the strategy of Hope and Struhl(22.Hope I.A. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2781-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). An Lrp derivative having 12 extra amino acids at the NH2 terminus, including 6 His residues (6XHis-Lrp), shows DNA binding characteristics that are almost identical to the wild type (data not shown). By performing electrophoresis for 15 h, Lrp•DNA and 6XHis-Lrp•DNA complexes were clearly separated (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). A mixture of homo- and heterodimers was created by mixing the wild type and 6XHis proteins, denaturing in 6 M guanidine, and renaturing by dilution. A band shift experiment performed with this mixture and DNA having a single Lrp binding site showed bands corresponding to complexes of DNA with wild type homodimer, 6XHis-Lrp homodimer, and wild type/6XHis-Lrp heterodimer (Fig. 2, lane 3). This is the expected pattern for binding of two Lrp monomers to a single binding site(22.Hope I.A. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2781-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). An analysis of both natural and synthetic DNAs established the following as the consensus sequence for Lrp binding: YAGHAWATTWTDCTR, where Y = C/T, H =“not G,” W = A/T, D= “not C,” R = A/G(12.Cui Y.

We synthesized a double-stranded 15 mer having a sequence that closely matched the consensus and observed no measurable binding of this DNA to Lrp (data not shown). The fact that this same sequence bound Lrp tightly when embedded within a 50-mer sequence (12.Cui Y. Wang Q. Stormo G.D. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4872-4880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that strong binding required, in addition to a 15-mer recognition sequence, DNA that flanked that recognition sequence. We used the procedure of Liu-Johnson et al.(20.Liu-Johnson H.N. Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) to investigate the extent of flanking sequences that were required for tight binding. Single-stranded 50 mers having an embedded sequence that was closely related to the consensus were subjected to primer extension in the presence of dideoxynucleotides, yielding a nested set of primer-extended products differing in length by one base. The identities of the constructs used in primer extension are shown in Fig. 3, D and E. Here and elsewhere in this report, F refers to the strand in Fig. 3E that is written 5′ to 3′ left to right and R refers to the complementary strand shown in Fig. 3D, written 3′ to 5′. The products of primer extension were mixed with Lrp, and DNA complexed with Lrp was separated from free DNA by electrophoresis. After removing protein, samples of both were fractionated by electrophoresis through acrylamide gels under conditions of denaturation. Each of the two strands of the 50 mer were analyzed by primer extension, giving the results shown in Fig. 3, A and B. This method yields the binding constants of each of the primer-extended fragments (Kn) according to the equation: KnK50=Cn/DnC50/D50(Eq. 1) where K50 is the binding constant for the full length 50 mer, Cn and Dn are the band intensities of the complex and free DNA for each fragment, and C50 and D50 are the band intensities of the complex and free DNA for the 50 mer(20.Liu-Johnson H.N. Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The radioactivity in each band in Fig. 3, A and B, was quantified with a Betascope blot analyzer and used to calculate values of Kn/K50 (Fig. 3, C and F). The results for the R and F strands used as template were similar in the sense that good binding in both cases required extension at least through the 15-bp consensus sequence. Furthermore, good binding in the experiment in which the R strand was template seemed to require 3-5 additional base pairs beyond the consensus sequence (Fig. 3C). A potential conclusion from these experiments is that given 15 bp or so of flanking double-stranded DNA on one side of the consensus, only a relatively few base pairs (from 0 to 3) are required on the other side of the consensus to get tight binding. However, another possibility has to be considered, namely that the single-stranded DNA portions of these primer-extended molecules affect binding to Lrp. As shown below, that turns out to be true. It makes a difference whether the single-stranded DNA is on the left or right of the double-stranded regions, and whether the polarity of the single-stranded DNA is 5′ to 3′ or 3′ to 5′. These conclusions are derived from a comparison of the results described above with the results of additional primer extension experiments summarized in Fig. 4. In parts A and C, the 50-mer R strand served as template, and the primer was the complementary 15-mer consensus sequence. In parts B and D, the configuration was the same as for A and C, but the single-stranded tail of the template strand to the left of the consensus was not present. To facilitate a comparison of all of these results, we summarize them in Fig. 5 using a simplified notation. Binding of the double-stranded 50 mer to Lrp is set at 100% (Fig. 5, line 1), and other results are relative to this. Note that, for each of the comparisons in Fig. 5, the 15-bp consensus region is double-stranded. It is clear that single-stranded DNA flanking the consensus can significantly contribute to binding (Fig. 5, compare lines 2 and 4 with line 5). Furthermore, the polarity of the single-stranded DNA to the left of the consensus affects the degree of binding (Fig. 5, compare lines 2 and 4). Finally, the positioning of double-stranded and single-stranded DNA relative to the consensus affects binding (Fig. 5, compare lines 2 and 3). Thus, the construct having double-stranded DNA to the right of the consensus and single-stranded DNA to the left shows stronger binding than the construct with the opposite configuration.Figure 5:Summary of Lrp binding to DNAs having flanking double and single-stranded regions. Each DNA construct has a 15-bp double-stranded sequence that closely matches the consensus (shaded region), and flanking DNA that is either double-stranded or single-stranded. In each schematic, the top strand has polarity 5′ to 3′. Binding is relative to the double-stranded 50 mer that was included in each experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A set of double-stranded DNA molecules were prepared having lengths 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25 bp with the consensus occupying the center of molecules (Fig. 6A). Fig. 6, B and C, shows the relative binding of these constructs as measured by a gel retardation experiment. The 15, 17, and 19 mers showed almost no binding, whereas the 21, 23, and 25 mers showed substantial binding relative to the double-stranded 50 mer. Thus, 3 bp flanking each side of the consensus is sufficient for binding, and 5 bp flanking each side is nearly as good as a stretch as long as 25 bp. In another set of experiments, we investigated the binding of Lrp to constructs having different lengths of single-stranded DNA flanking a constant double-stranded consensus region (Fig. 7, A and B). We chose 17 bp as the length of the double-stranded consensus region because such a minimal sequence did not bind Lrp (Fig. 6), and therefore we could expect to see an effect of single-stranded flanking DNA. In addition, a preliminary experiment showed that a 17:50 mer complex (and 19:50, 21:50, 23:50, and 25:50 complexes) bound Lrp with avidity equal to or greater than the double-stranded 50 mer (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 7C, if the flanking single-stranded DNA was of polarity F, then as little as two additional bases flanking each side of the double-stranded region contributed to increased binding and additional bases added to the strength of binding. The majority of added binding strength, however, was contributed by single-stranded DNA that was longer than 4 bases. The contribution of flanking single-stranded R strand to binding also was substantial only with a relatively long length of DNA, and was always less than that for an equivalent length of F DNA. These results are consistent with those mentioned above indicating that single-stranded DNA can contribute to Lrp binding and that the contribution of F and R single-stranded DNA is different. The results in Figure 6:, Figure 7: demonstrating that both double- and single-stranded flanking DNA can contribute to Lrp binding were obtained in experiments employing only a single Lrp concentration. In a separate experiment employing just two of the constructs, we measured complex formation over a range of Lrp concentrations including Lrp in great excess. The apparent binding constants for Lrp binding to the double-stranded 50 mer and the 17R:50F construct were very similar (1.5 versus 1.7 nM, respectively), confirming the data for those constructs in Fig. 7. We measured the relative stability of Lrp•DNA complexes as a function of NaCl concentration. We chose the 50 mer F strand hybridized to a complementary 17 mer (Fig. 8A), a construct that binds Lrp with relatively high affinity (Fig. 7C). In parallel, we investigated the effect of salt on binding of Lrp to the double-stranded 50 mer. As shown in Fig. 8B, the effect of salt was larger on the construct with flanking single-stranded DNA than on the double-stranded construct. In addition, we measured the effects of competitor DNA on binding of Lrp to the two constructs shown in Fig. 8A. The competitor DNAs were single and double-stranded forms of a 44 mer having a sequence unrelated to the Lrp binding consensus. Neither single nor double-stranded DNA competed very effectively against either of the constructs bound to Lrp: the binding constant was reduced less than two fold by competitors in 50-100-fold molar excess (data not shown). For each of six operons thought to be directly controlled by Lrp, DNase I footprinting studies suggest that Lrp interacts with or affects the structure of DNA over a region of 100 bp or more(4.Gally D.L.

Lrp clearly interacts with multiple sites within these regions, and in the cases of fim A(4.Gally D.L. Rucker T.J. Blomfield I.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5665-5672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ilvIH(5.Wang Q. Calvo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), lysU(6.Gazeau M. Delort F.

Low, manuscript submitted for publication. those interactions are cooperative. Here we define the stoichiometry of interaction as two Lrp monomers binding to a single site. Lrp in micromolar concentrations exists as a dimer in solution(3.Willins D.A. Ryan C.W. Platko J.V. Calvo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10768-10774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and some preliminary experiments indicate that the dimer structure of Lrp is maintained even at concentrations well below the nanomolar range.2 Therefore, the unit of binding can be considered an Lrp dimer. A consensus for Lrp binding was formulated by a computer analysis of sequences associated with the Lrp regulon (23.Rex J.H. Aronson B.D. Somerville R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5944-5953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by a comparison of naturally occurring Lrp binding sites(11.Wang Q. Sacco M. Ricca E. Lago C.T. DeFelice M. Calvo J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A more extensive analysis of 63 binding sites derived by using the Selex approach of Tuerk and Gold (13.Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8004) Google Scholar) yielded a consensus sequence 15 bp in length that was palindromic in part and that was very similar to the consensus sequences derived previously(12.Cui Y. Wang Q. Stormo G.D. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4872-4880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The work presented here indicates 15 bp may be sufficient for specificity, but an additional 3-5 flanking base pairs are required for tight binding. These additional flanking base pairs may contribute additional binding energy, as was proposed for the Crp/DNA interaction(20.Liu-Johnson H.N. Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Alternatively, DNA ends may be disruptive to binding, and strong binding may require that these ends be displaced from the site of protein-DNA contact by several base pairs. We cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. Lrp binds tightly to double-stranded DNA having a sequence related to the consensus, but not to that same DNA after it has been denatured (5.Wang Q. Calvo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, Lrp does not bind tightly per se to single-stranded DNA. However, as demonstrated here, single-stranded DNA can stimulate Lrp binding when it flanks a double-stranded consensus sequence. There are at least three ways in which single-stranded flanking DNA could affect binding of Lrp. Single-stranded flanking DNA might bind to the same site on Lrp that normally binds double-stranded flanking DNA. The effects of NaCl on binding suggest that this possibility is not correct. Part of the binding of Lrp to DNA is likely driven by an increase in entropy due to the release of Na ions from the DNA(24.Lohman T. Mascotti D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 400-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Binding of Lrp to double-stranded DNA is expected to release more sodium ions than binding to an equivalent length of single-stranded DNA and thus higher sodium ion concentrations should reduce binding to double-stranded DNA more than binding to single-stranded DNA. In fact, the opposite is the case (Fig. 8B). Another possibility is that single-stranded DNA interacts with Lrp at a second site and that this binding increases the strength with which the consensus sequence interacts with its binding site on Lrp. This possibility seems ruled out by the data showing that single-stranded competitor DNA reduces rather than increases binding to Lrp. A third possibility is that Lrp interacts only weakly with single-stranded DNA at some site other than the major binding site, but that this weak interaction provides the few kilocalories of energy required for binding of Lrp in the nanomolar range to the 17R:50F construct. The results of the competition experiment are consistent with this interpretation. The fact that single-stranded competitor DNA did not compete effectively can be explained by the fact that its concentration, although high relative to the labeled DNA, is much lower than the effective concentration of tethered single-stranded DNA. Data summarized in Fig. 5 indicate that the binding strength conferred by single-stranded DNA depends upon whether that DNA is on the left or the right of the core binding sequence, and upon which of the two strands is single stranded. The difference in binding strength may reflect differences in the sequences of the single-stranded regions and/or differences in the halves of the 15-bp core binding sequence. The consensus sequence is partially palindromic (12.Cui Y. Wang Q. Stormo G.D. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4872-4880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for the particular sequence used here, one of the two half sites is calculated to be a better match to the consensus than the other(12.Cui Y. Wang Q. Stormo G.D. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4872-4880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that one of the two subunits of Lrp is bound more tightly than the other, and this might contribute to the asymmetry observed in the binding of flanking single-stranded DNA. It is not clear that the binding of single-stranded DNA to Lrp has any biological significance. However, one can imagine possible roles for such an activity (for example, binding to single-stranded DNA produced during transcription initiation), and therefore it will be of interest to determine whether mutant Lrps having altered regulatory properties are also altered in their ability to bind single-stranded DNA.

These results strongly suggest the existence of a histone-like surface on TFIID. The transcription factor TFIID plays a central role in the assembly of the basic transcriptional machinery into a preinitiation complex (for review, see (1.Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar)). TFIID binds to the core promoter and thus provides a foundation for association of the other initiation factors and RNA polymerase II. Biochemical studies of eukaryotic transcriptional activation demonstrate both physical and functional interactions of activators with TFIID that in turn facilitate preinitiation complex assembly and function (for review, see (1.Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar)). TFIID is a multimeric protein complex, comprising the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used are: TBPTATA box-binding proteinTAFTBP-associated factorbpbase pair(s)GSTglutathione S-transferaseNTAnitriloacetateaaamino acids. and numerous tightly associated factors called TAFs (for review, see (2.Tjian R.

To date, nine TAF subunits of Drosophila TFIID (dTAFⅡ230, −150, −110, −85, −62, −42, −28α, −28β, and −22) have been cloned (reviewed in (3.Burley, S. K., Roeder, R. G. (1996) Annu. Rev.

In addition, several homologs have been isolated from both human (hTAF) and yeast (yTAF), suggesting that TAF-mediated activation pathways are conserved from yeast to man (reviewed in (3.Burley, S.

A central question in eukaryotic transcriptional regulation is how TFIID gains access to a chromatin template and how stable association is maintained within the chromosome. A potentially relevant finding is that the N-terminal regions of the dTAFⅡ62 and dTAFⅡ42 proteins have sequence similarities with the C-terminal core domain of histones H4 and H3, respectively(4.Kokubo T.

The nucleosome core consists of 146 bp of DNA wrapped around an octameric complex of two copies of each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Despite a low sequence similarity, all histones contain a long helix flanked on either side by a loop segment and short helix, termed the “histone fold” (reviewed in (10.Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 11.Ramakrishnan V. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The histone fold is involved in formation of the stable H2A-H2B and H3-H4 heterodimers. H3-H4 dimers further associate to form the (H3-H4)2 tetramer. The (H3-H4)2 tetramer alone is responsible for organizing the core 120 bp of DNA into the arrangement found in the octameric complex(13.Hayes J.J. Clark D.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6829-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Recently, numerous proteins potentially containing the histone fold have been identified by data base search(14.Baxevanis A.D. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This group includes TAFⅡ62 and TAFⅡ42, plus many DNA-binding proteins and multimeric proteins. The data base search also identified transcription initiation factor TFIIB as a protein that has the histone fold. However, both NMR (15.Bagby S. Kim S. Maldonado E. Tong K.I. Reinberg D. Ikura M. Cell. 1995; 82: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (16.Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) show that TFIIB does not have the histone fold. Thus, it is crucial to confirm the prediction using biochemical and physical techniques. To investigate the significance of the sequence similarities between dTAFⅡ62-dTAFⅡ42 and histones H4-H3, we have tested the ability of the histone-like regions in dTAFⅡ62 and dTAFⅡ42 to form a stable heteromeric complex. Here, we demonstrate that the histone-homologous regions of dTAFⅡ62 and dTAFⅡ42 form a heteromeric complex both in vitro and in a yeast two-hybrid system. We further demonstrate that this heteromeric complex, like the H3-H4 complex, is predominantly α-helical. The results described here strongly suggest that TFIID has a histone-like surface. To make a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged dTAFⅡ62 expression plasmid, DNA encoding dTAFⅡ62 residues 1-91 (4.Kokubo T. Gong D.W. Wootton J.C. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y.

For yeast two-hybrid plasmids, both dTAFⅡ62 (amino acids 1-91) and dTAFⅡ42 (amino acids 1-100) were amplified as NcoI-BamHI fragments and subcloned into both pAS1-CYH2 and pACTII. 3S. J.

GST-tagged dTAFⅡ62 and His-tagged dTAFⅡ42 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and BL21 cells, respectively, according to a standard protocol(17.Yamashita S. Wada K. Horikoshi M. Gong D.W.

After harvesting the bacteria, all procedures were carried out at 4°C. Bacterial pellets were resuspended into [1,25] culture volume of buffer B (20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.5 M KCl and 6 M guanidine HCl and rotated for 60 min. After centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to estimate the concentrations of the recombinant proteins. Extracts were mixed in an equimolar ratio and dialyzed against buffer B containing 0.5 M KCl and 1 M guanidine HCl for 12 h. Dialysis was continued for another 12 h in buffer B containing 0.1 M KCl and 0.1 M guanidine HCl. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was used for interaction experiments. The supernatant was incubated with [1,20] bed volume of either Ni2⁺-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) or glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) for 30 min with rotation and washed with the same buffer 5 times. Protein was eluted from Ni2⁺-NTA and glutathione matrices with the same buffer containing 100 mM imidazole or 20 mM glutathione (pH 7.5), respectively. For CD measurements, both His- and GST-tags were removed from the dTAFⅡ62-dTAFⅡ42 complex in the following manner. The complex was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose as described above and was equilibrated with digestion buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.15 M KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and 10% glycerol. Cleavage was carried out in 1 bed volume of the same buffer containing thrombin (10 units/ml). The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer B containing 0.5 M KCl. For further purification, 50 μl of the sample was applied to Superose 12 (25-ml bed volume) and chromatographed with the same buffer. The peak fractions (>98% purity) were used for CD measurements. CD measurements were performed at 25°C using a Jasco J700 spectropolarimeter. The spectra are presented as the average of eight scans in units of mean residue ellipticity (θ). The concentration of the protein was 15.7 μM in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). Protein concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and using a calculated extinction coefficient. The protein was denatured by the addition of guanidine hydrochloride to a concentration of 6 M. Protein secondary structure was estimated using the software supplied with the Jasco J700 spectropolarimeter. Plasmids for the yeast two-hybrid system were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 in various combinations as shown in Table 1. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described(18.Gill G. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 121-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Based on the similarities between dTAFⅡ62 and dTAFⅡ42, and histones H4 and H3, intermolecular interactions between the histone-like regions in dTAFⅡ62 and dTAFⅡ42 were examined. dTAFⅡ62 (aa 1-91) and dTAFⅡ42 (aa 1-100) were expressed independently in E. coli as His- and GST-tagged proteins, respectively (Fig. 1A). Since both recombinant polypeptides are highly insoluble (data not shown), they were solubilized by disrupting E. coli in buffer containing 6 M guanidine. The two extracts were mixed at an equimolar ratio of recombinant polypeptides and co-renatured by dialyzing against buffer containing 0.1 M guanidine (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Complexes were purified by Ni2⁺-NTA agarose chromatography followed by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography (lanes 2 and 3). GST-dTAFⅡ62 (aa 1-91) and His-dTAFⅡ42 (aa 1-100) proteins co-purified through these chromatographic steps. Similar results were obtained by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography followed by Ni2⁺-NTA-agarose chromatography (lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, no specific protein was observed after the second chromatography step in controls including single extract (lanes 6-11). The far-UV (250-200 nm) CD spectrum of the dTAFⅡ62 (aa 1-91)-dTAFⅡ42 (aa 1-100) heterocomplex is shown in Fig. 2. The overall shape of the spectrum, with minima in the mean residue ellipticity at 208 and 222 nm, is characteristic of polypeptides dominated by α-helical secondary structure. In support of this, we used manufacturer-supplied software to obtain the following estimates for the secondary structure: 41.4% α-helix, 8.4% β-strand, 15.8% turn, and 34.4% random. The interaction between the histone-like regions was further analyzed in a yeast two-hybrid system. dTAFⅡ62 (aa 1-91) and dTAFⅡ42 (aa 1-100) were fused to either the GAL4 DNA-binding domain or activation domain. Yeast bearing an integrated GAL1-lacZ fusion were transformed with different combinations of plasmids (Table 1). The lacZ reporter gene is expressed in a manner dependent on the interaction of dTAFⅡ62 and dTAFⅡ42. Neither dTAFⅡ62 nor dTAFⅡ42 displayed significant activity when tested for self-interaction. We therefore conclude that dTAFⅡ62 and dTAFⅡ42 form only heteromeric complexes. It is noteworthy that dTAFⅡ62 and dTAFⅡ42 inhibited yeast growth (doubling time, >10 h) only when they were transformed together. Overexpression of acidic activators also inhibits yeast growth(19.Berger S.L. Pina B. Silverman N. Marcus G.A. Agapite J. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Guarente L. Cell. 1992; 70: 251-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The growth inhibition may thus be caused by exceptionally strong interactions between dTAFⅡ62 and dTAFⅡ42, resulting in overproduction of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain-activation domain complex. Alternatively, the heteromeric dTAFⅡ62-dTAFⅡ42 complex may titrate yeast factors important for growth. In summary, we have demonstrated that the N-terminal regions of dTAFⅡ62 and dTAFⅡ42, similar in sequence to nucleosome core histones H4 and H3, form a heteromeric complex both in vitro and in a yeast two-hybrid system. Like histones H3 and H4, neither dTAFⅡ62 nor dTAFⅡ42 forms a homomeric complex, and CD measurements suggest that the heteromeric dTAFⅡ62-dTAFⅡ42 complex is dominated by α-helical secondary structure. In some promoters, including the adenovirus major late and human gfa promoters(20.Horikoshi M. Wang C.K. Fujii H. Cromlish J.A. Weil P.A. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These results indicate that one or more TAFs contribute to the downstream interaction. Recent studies with recombinant TAFs demonstrated that dTAFⅡ150 alone can bind to the initiator element(23.Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Chen J.L. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 264: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Moreover, the dTAFⅡ150-TBP complex gives a footprint from the TATA box through to 35 bp downstream from the initiation site(23.Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Chen J.L. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 264: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 24.Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), like native TFIID. However, the dTAFⅡ150-TBP complex does not produce DNase I-hypersensitive sites as observed for native TFIID(24.Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that other TAFs are also involved in the downstream interaction. We predict that the histone-like region in dTAFⅡ62-dTAFⅡ42 is bound to the downstream sequence because, similar to histone core, TFIID produces DNase I-hypersensitive sites about every 10 bp. The important question is whether the dTAFⅡ62-dTAFⅡ42 complex is a heterodimer or heterotetramer in the TFIID complex; the N-terminal histone-like regions of dTAFⅡ62-dTAFⅡ42 do form heterotetramers under physiological conditions, 4X. Xie and S. K. Burley, personal communication. suggesting that these TAFs could be present as a tetramer in the TFIID complex. The downstream interaction plays an important role in both basal and activated transcription. TFIID binds to the downstream region in a DNA sequence-dependent fashion, at least in the human gfa promoter, contributing to both stable TFIID binding and effective transcription in vitro(22.Nakatani Y. Horikoshi M. Brenner M. Yamamoto T. Besnard F. Roeder R.G. Freese E. Nature. 1990; 348: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25.Nakatani Y. Brenner M. Freese E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4289-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the adenovirus E4 promoter, TFIID does not bind to the downstream region and produces very low basal transcription activity. Importantly, activators induce the downstream interaction and facilitate preinitiation complex formation(26.Horikoshi M. Carey M.F. Kakidani H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 665-669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 27.Horikoshi M. Hai T. Lin Y.S. Green M.R. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the histone-like domains may have a more critical role in a natural chromatin environment, e.g. stimulation of the displacement of nucleosomal histones near the transcription start site and/or maintenance of histone exclusion from the transcription start site.

https://openalex.org/W1891562957,"The actin fold is a structural motif involved in binding of ATP to an otherwise diverse family of proteins that includes hexokinase, actin, and the 70 kDa heat shock protein. Previous analyses have focused attention on a hydrophobic pocket within the large lobe of hexokinase (and analogous regions in other proteins possessing the actin fold motif) as the-site for binding of the adenine moiety. However, there is reason to believe that binding of the adenine moiety also involves a beta-sheet region located in the small lobe of hexokinase. It is postulated that functional interaction with ATP, required for catalysis, involves interactions with both regions. The expected structural consequences provide a basis for explaining the kinetic mechanism suggested for this enzyme, i.e., although both substrates can bind independently, the preferred kinetic pathway is not random but ordered, with glucose binding first. The structural features postulated to be involved in binding of ATP to hexokinase are also found in other proteins possessing the actin fold motif. Interaction of the nucleotide with the beta-sheet region, analogous to that found in the ""small lobe"" of hexokinase, may induce functionally important conformational changes in other proteins employing the actin fold as a nucleotide binding motif."
https://openalex.org/W1958327091,"RANTES is a member of the low molecular cytokines and appears to be strictly a chemotactic and activating factor for eosinophils. We studied the effect of RANTES on the channel activity of the eosinophilic cell line (EoL-1 cells) using patch clamp techniques. Under cell-attached patch conditions, RANTES (20 ng/ml) activated channels in EoL-1 cells when applied to the recording pipette or to the bath. This channel was permeable to K+ with a unit conductance of 14 pS, and the reversal potential was close to the equilibrium potential for K+. The current-voltage relationship for this K+ channel was almost linear, showing little or no rectification. The open time and closed time histograms could he fitted to a single exponential function with time constants of 6.4 and 2.7 ms, respectively. Extracellular application of the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 microM) under cell-attached patch conditions or an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration under inside-out patch conditions increased K+ channel activity in a manner similar to that caused by RANTES, indicating that the RANTES-activated channel was the Ca2+ -activated K+ channel. Intracellular application of GTP gamma S (10 microM) opened the Ca2+V-activated K+ channels under inside-out patch conditions. Furthermore, RANTES failed to activate the K+ channels after the cells had been treated with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) for 2 h at 37 degrees C. These results suggest that RANTES opens the Ca2+ -activated K+ channels of EoL-1 cells through activation of G-proteins."

Therefore, it is possible that elevated O2 may indirectly affect lung fibroblast growth via modulation of extracellular matrix. In the present study, we investigated the effect of elevated O2 on the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans (PGs) by fetal lung fibroblasts. A 48-h exposure to ≥50% O2 reduced the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine and 32SO4 into GAGs by fetal lung fibroblasts. The relative proportion of the individual GAG molecules was not altered by elevated O2. Fibroblasts exposed to 50% O2 secreted less [32S]proteoglycans into the medium than controls. Specifically, the synthesis of the small soluble PG, biglycan, was decreased by exposure to 50% O2. Fetal lung fibroblasts did not synthesize the small chondroitin/dermatan sulfate PG, decorin. Elevated O2 concentrations also reduced the synthesis of membrane- and matrix-associated PGs. Furthermore, exposure of fetal lung fibroblasts to ≥50% O2 resulted in a decreased mRNA expression for biglycan and versican core protein sequences. In contrast, elevated O2 increased the message for type I collagen and fibronectin without affecting that of β-actin. The inhibitory effect of elevated O2 on biglycan mRNA and protein expression was overcome by incubating the cells in 3% O2 after the 48-h exposure to 50% O2. The latter treatment also reversed the increased mRNA expression of type I collagen associated with elevated O2 but not that of fibronectin. These results demonstrate that fetal lung fibroblasts, in response to elevated oxygen concentrations, selectively down-regulate their GAG and PG synthesis and that this O2 effect is reversible.

GAGs are long polyanionic carbohydrate chains composed of repeating disaccharide units (uronic acid and hexosamine) carrying a negative charge, which results in their binding to other matrix components and cell adhesion molecules(4.Ruoslahti E.

Most GAGs are covalently linked to a core protein as proteoglycans (PGs). PGs show a marked variation in the size of the core protein and the number and size of GAG side chains attached. Some proteoglycans are cell-associated, and others are present in interstitial matrices(4.Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev.

Recent studies have demonstrated that GAGs also directly affect cell proliferation. Heparan sulfate molecules are potent inhibitors of smooth muscle cell growth(12.Benitz W.E. Kelley R.T.

Additionally, hyaluronic acid inhibits fetal skin fibroblast proliferation but stimulates collagen and noncollagen protein synthesis(13.Mast B.A. Diegelmann R.F. Krummel T.M. Cohen I.K. Matrix. 1993; 13: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These properties suggest that GAGs and PGs may mediate, at least in part, cell adhesion, structural organization, and cell proliferation during fetal lung development. Thus, alterations in GAG and PG content in the interstitial matrix following elevated oxygen may disrupt normal fibroblast adhesion and affect fibroblast proliferation. It has been shown that the distribution and density of PGs in alveolar basement membranes is decreased in lung injury resulting from short term oxygen exposure(14.Ferrarra T.B. Fox R.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1992; 6: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In contrast, exposure of newborn rats to 85% oxygen for up to 6 weeks has been reported to result in an increase in biglycan mRNA expression and immunoreactivity, specifically in alveolar cells in areas of increased cellularity(15.Veness-Meehan K.A. Rhodes D.R. Stiles A.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The effect of oxygen on PG metabolism may be due to increased intracellular generation of partially reduced oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species have been demonstrated to affect GAG and PG synthesis in cultured chondrocytes (16.Panasyuk A. Frati E. Ribeault D. Mitriovic D. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1994; 16: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Physiological concentrations of reactive oxygen species stimulate PG formation, while higher concentrations decrease PG synthesis(16.Panasyuk A. Frati E. Ribeault D. Mitriovic D.

Whether elevated oxygen concentrations directly affect GAG and PG synthesis or destroy existing PGs has yet not been determined.

Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and grown to confluence in MEM with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in 3% O2 and were then maintained in serum-free medium in a gas phase containing 3, 50, or 95% O2 with 5% CO2 for 24 h prior to a 24-h incubation in the same O2 concentration in serum-free MEM containing either 5 μCi/ml [6-3H]glucosamine or 10 μCi/ml Na232SO4. Radioactive glucosamine is a precursor for both sulfated (heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate) and nonsulfated (hyaluronan) GAGs, whereas 32S-labeled sulfate is only incorporated into sulfated GAG molecules. Total GAGs were isolated and characterized as described by Castor et al.(18.Castor C.W. Fremuth T.D. Furlong A.M. Jourdian G.W. In Vitro. 1983; 19: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After incubation with [3H]glucosamine, both medium (extracellular compartment) and cell layer fractions (cellular compartment), were adjusted to 0.2 M NaOH and left overnight to hydrolyze the core protein-glycosaminoglycan linkage. The solutions were then neutralized (pH 6-8) with 2 M HCl. An aliquot of each solution was taken for estimation of radiolabeled total GAG synthesis using a modification of the cetylpyridinium chloride method(18.Castor C.W. Fremuth T.D. Furlong A.M. Jourdian G.W. In Vitro. 1983; 19: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19.Caniggia I. Tanswell K.A. Post M. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The remainder of the cell layer and medium fractions was subjected to anion exchange HPLC to separate individual GAG molecules, as described previously(20.Lee Y.J. Radhakrishnamurthy B. Dalferes E.R. Berenson G.S. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 419: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate C (5 μg each) were added as carrier material to the remaining cell-matrix and medium fractions. Fractions were then boiled, and GAG molecules were collected by ethanol precipitation at −20°C. The samples were dissolved in 150 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 10 mM CaCl2, and 100 mM glucosamine and treated with Pronase to digest all residual protein. GAGs were then precipitated by ethanol containing 1.3% (w/v) sodium acetate. The precipitated GAGs were collected by centrifugation, and the GAG pellet was dissolved in H2O. Hyaluronan, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate were separated on a DEAE-5-PW column (75 × 7.5 mm) with a sodium chloride gradient (0-1 M in 10% methanol) and a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Identification of GAG molecules was performed by their destruction using Streptomyces hyaluronidase (8 units/ml), heparitinase (0.06 units/ml), and chondroitinase ABC (0.25 units/ml) as described by Copp and Bernfield(21.Copp A.J. Bernfield M. Dev. Biol. 1988; 130: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of O2 on cell number, parallel culture wells were incubated with serum-free MEM. After the 48-h incubation period, the cells were trypsinized and counted electronically using a Coulter particle counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). In order to investigate the effect of O2 on sulfated PG synthesis, fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in MEM with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in 3% O2 and were then maintained in serum-free medium in a gas phase containing 3 or 50% O2 for 24 h prior to a 24-h incubation in the same O2 concentration in serum-free MEM containing 50 μCi/ml Na232SO4. After the incubation with radioactive sulfate, media were collected and dialyzed extensively against distilled water (Mr < 3,500) in the presence of 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell layer was washed several times with large volumes of PBS, and the cell membrane fraction was extracted on ice for 10 min with 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The remaining extracellular matrix fraction was rinsed with PBS and treated with either chondroitinase ABC or heparitinase or left untreated prior to extraction by scraping with a rubber policeman in SDS sample buffer (10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.0025% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.06 M Tris, pH 8.0). Aliquots (100 μl) of dialyzed media samples, cell membrane fraction, and extracellular matrix fraction were then incubated in PBS with or without chondroitinase ABC (100 milliunits/ml) or heparitinase (20 milliunits/ml) at 37°C. After a 24-h incubation, samples were boiled in SDS-sample buffer and fractionated on 5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were fixed in 10% (v/v) acetic acid, prepared for fluorography by soaking in En3 Hance (DuPont NEN), dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film using Dupont Cronex intensifying screens. The films were quantified using an Ultroscan XL laser densitometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Total cellular RNA was isolated from the fibroblast cultures by lysing the cells in 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate followed by centrifugation on a 5.7 M cesium chloride cushion to pellet RNA. This total RNA (15 μg) was size-fractionated on a 1% (v/v) agarose gel containing 3% (v/v) formaldehyde, transferred to Hybond N membranes, and immobilized by UV cross-linking. The cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random primers. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed in 50% (v/v) formamide, 5 × SSPE, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42°C. Following hybridization, the blots were washed with 0.5 × SSC containing 0.2% (w/v) SDS at 65°C and autoradiographed with Kodak XAR-5 film overnight at −70°C. Blots were then stripped and, for normalization, rehybridized with radiolabeled rat β-actin cDNA. The autoradiographs were quantified using an Ultroscan XL laser densitometer (Pharmacia). Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined by analysis of variance followed by assessment of differences using Dunnet's two-sided test (22.Snedecor G.W. Cochran W.G. Statistical Methods. Iowa State University Press, Ames1980Google Scholar) or Duncan's multiple range test(23.Steel R.G.D. Torrie J.H. Principles and Procedures of Statistics. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1970Google Scholar). Exposure of fetal lung fibroblasts to 50% O2 for 48 h reduced the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into total GAGs by ~40% without changing the number of cells adhered to the plastic (Fig. 1). A 95% O2 exposure reduced both cell number and GAG synthesis. However, GAG synthesis of cells exposed to 95% O2 was not further reduced from that of fibroblasts exposed to 50% O2. The relative distribution of GAGs between medium and cell-matrix layer was not affected by elevated oxygen concentrations (3% O2, 46.7 ± 2.1% of total GAGs in medium; 50% O2, 51.2 ± 4.8% of total GAGs in medium; 95% O2, 49.4 ± 1.9% of total GAGs in medium (mean ± S.E., n = 3)). A similar inhibitory effect of elevated O2 was noted when 32SO4 was used as radioactive precursor. This suggests that the O2 effects on GAG synthesis are not due to changes in precursor pools. Fetal lung fibroblast, grown in 3% O2, synthesized and deposited hyaluronan, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate in the cell-matrix compartment. Heparan sulfate was the main GAG component secreted into the medium. The effect of elevated O2 on the individual GAG molecules produced by the fibroblasts is shown in Fig. 2. Although total GAG synthesis decreased, the composition of GAG molecules in the medium and in the cell-matrix layer was not significantly changed by exposing the cells to either 50 or 95% O2. As exposure to 95% O2 affected cell number (Fig. 1) and cell viability (41.Bjermer L. Engstrom-Laurent A. Lundgren R. Rosenhall L. Hallgren D.R. Br. Med. J. 1987; 295: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we carried out all further experiments at 50% O2. Confluent fibroblast cultures were incubated with 32SO4 to label the PGs, and the conditioned medium was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to identify the soluble PGs. The results demonstrate that fetal lung fibroblasts synthesized [32S]sulfate-labeled macromolecules with high Mr values that did not enter into the gel and remained on top of the separating gel (Fig. 3). In addition, the fibroblasts synthesized [32S]sulfate-labeled macromolecules with relatively small molecular weights (Fig. 3). The approximate Mr ranges from 190,000 to 250,000, which is in the same range as that of biglycan(24.Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Tang L-H. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Webber C. Reiner A. Poole A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6304-6313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Choi H.U. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. Neame P.J. J. Biol.

The [32S]sulfate-labeled macromolecules in this band were sensitive to chondroitinase ABC lyase digestion, suggesting that the PGs in this band belong to the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate type. The [32S]sulfate-labeled macromolecules that remain on top of the gel were partially degraded by chondroitinase ABC lyase. Heparitinase treatment reduced the intensity of the large Mr band but not that of the biglycan band. Thus, it is likely that this band represents the large PGs, versican and heparan sulfate PGs. No sulfated band with a molecular mass of approximately 100-150 kDa, representing the small chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan decorin(24.Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Tang L-H. Johnson T.L. Pal S.

Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was synthesized by the fibroblasts. Exposure of fetal lung fibroblasts to 50% O2 decreased the incorporation of 32SO4 into both biglycan and larger PGs by 3.4 ± 0.6- and 3.3 ± 0.7-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 3 separate experiments), respectively (Fig. 3). To evaluate reversibility, fetal lung fibroblasts were first exposed for 48 h to 50% O2 and then for 48 h to 3% O2. As can been seen in Fig. 4, the incorporation of [32SO4] into biglycan in these cells was similar to that of cells exposed to 3% O2, suggesting that the effect of elevated O2 on PG synthesis is reversible.Figure 4:Reversibility of the effect of elevated O2 concentrations on PG synthesis by fetal lung fibroblasts. The cells were exposed for 24 h to 3 or 50% O2 prior to a 24-h incubation with 32SO4 in the same O2 concentration. To determine reversibility, another set of cells was exposed for 48 h to 50% followed by a 48-h incubation in a gas phase of 3% O2. The cells were labeled with 32SO4 during the last 24-h incubation in 3% O2. The media samples were dialyzed against distilled water, lyophilized, reconstituted in PBS, and incubated with either chondroitinase ABC (ABC) or heparitinase (H) or left untreated (C). A representative autoradiogram is shown. The position of undigested biglycan is shown on the left. Molecular mass marker positions are displayed on the right. Similar results were obtained in a second experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the effect of O2 on PGs associated with the cell membrane or extracellular matrix, fibroblasts were incubated in 3 or 50% O2 and labeled with 32SO4. The membrane fraction of fetal lung fibroblasts was extracted by 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and the remaining fraction was the extracellular matrix fraction. The cell-associated (membrane) fraction also contained [32S]biglycan and [32S]sulfate-labeled large PGs (Fig. 5). A major portion of the large macromolecules was resistant to chondroitinase ABC but not to heparitinase digestion, suggesting that cell- associated (membrane) PGs are mainly heparan sulfate PGs. Exposure of fibroblasts to 50% O2 decreased the synthesis of cell-associated (membrane) PGs. Besides [32S]biglycan, the cell-matrix fraction was also found to contain PGs with high Mr values (Fig. 5). The large PGs were partly degraded by chondroitinase ABC but completely by heparitinase, suggesting that extracellular matrix PGs consist of large chondroitin sulfate as well as heparan sulfate PGs. Again, fibroblasts exposed to 50% O2 incorporated less 32SO4 into PGs associated with the matrix fraction. The O2 effect on membrane and extracellular matrix PGs was also reversed by incubating the cells in 3% O2 after the 50% O2 exposure (not shown). To determine whether the alterations noted in [32S]PG synthesis by elevated O2 concentrations might be accompanied by similar changes in mRNA expression for PGs, total mRNA was extracted from fetal lung fibroblasts and hybridized with cDNAs coding for three different PG core proteins (Fig. 6). The biglycan cDNA detected a single mRNA transcript of 2.5 kb, consistent with biglycan mRNA transcript sizes reported for other cell types (26.Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Järveläinen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23274-23281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of biglycan did not change with time in culture. Exposure of fibroblasts to 50% O2 for 24 h resulted in a 4-fold decrease in biglycan mRNA levels (Fig. 7). Longer exposures to 50% O2 (48-72 h) or exposures to higher concentrations of O2 (90%) did not result in a further decrease in biglycan mRNA expression. In contrast to biglycan probe, a cDNA for decorin did not hybridize to mRNA of fetal lung fibroblasts (Fig. 6). The decorin cDNA detected, however, a transcript of 1.9 kb in fetal skin fibroblasts. 2J. Xu and M. Post, unpublished observation. This finding and the observation that fetal lung fibroblasts did not incorporate detectable amounts of 32SO4 into chondroitinase ABC-sensitive macromolecules with Mr of 120,000-160,000 suggest that fetal lung fibroblasts do not synthesize decorin. The effect of O2 on the expression of the large fibroblast proteoglycan, versican, core protein gene was also examined in the same mRNA preparations by Northern hybridizations. The versican cDNA hybridized to a 10-kb mRNA transcript (Fig. 6), a size identical to that of versican mRNA from several other cell types previously described(28.Kähäri V-M. Larjava H. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10608-10615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The versican mRNA expression in fetal lung fibroblasts did not change with time in culture. However, a 2-fold decrease in versican mRNA levels was noted in fibroblasts cultured for 24 h in a gas phase of 50% O2 (Fig. 7). Rehybridization of the filters with β-actin cDNA did not reveal any significant differences in β-actin mRNA levels (Fig. 6 and 7). To examine whether the decrease of PG mRNA by elevated O2 was a general metabolic effect, total RNA from fibroblasts exposed for 48 h to 3 or 50% O2 was also hybridized with cDNAs coding for procollagen type I and fibronectin. Again, exposure to 50% O2 reduced biglycan mRNA expression (Fig. 8). In contrast, procollagen type I and fibronectin mRNA expression were up-regulated by elevated O2 (Fig. 8). As mentioned previously, reversibility was tested by exposing fetal lung fibroblasts first to 50% O2 and then to 3% O2. In these cells, message levels for biglycan and type I collagen returned to that of control. However, fibronectin gene expression increased even further (Fig. 8). β-Actin gene expression was not affected by these treatments (Fig. 8). These findings suggest that elevated O2 selectively down-regulates PG mRNA expression in fetal lung fibroblasts and that the O2 effect on PG synthesis is reversible.Figure 7:The effect of elevated O2 concentrations on biglycan, versican, and β-actin mRNA levels in fetal rat lung fibroblasts. The cells were exposed to various concentrations of O2 for 0-72 h. Total cellular RNA (10 μg) was analyzed by successive Northern hybridizations of the same filter (ethidium bromide-stained gel) using cDNA probes indicated.

Similar results were obtained in a second experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Increasing evidence suggests that cell-matrix interactions play an important role in lung morphogenesis. Several studies suggest that matrix molecules can alter the growth of cells, with some components increasing and others decreasing proliferation(29.Martin G.R. Sank A.C Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. II. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1989: 463-477Google Scholar). Thus, changes in matrix molecules following an insult may modulate cell interaction with these matrix molecules, thereby disrupting normal proliferation. This is of particular importance in the preterm human infant, exposed to elevated oxygen concentrations for weeks or months, since a major portion of lung growth and development occurs over these first weeks or months of life. Chronic exposure to elevated concentrations of O2 is known to reduce lung growth and to cause pulmonary fibrosis in these infants(30.Thurlbeck W.M. Hum. Pathol. 1978; 9: 492-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 31.Margraf L.R. Tomashefski J.F. Bruce M.C. Dahms B.B. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 143: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that elevated O2 concentrations decrease the synthesis of GAGs and PGs by fetal lung fibroblasts. Using metabolic labeling with Na232SO4, we showed that biglycan was the most abundant proteoglycan secreted into the medium by fetal lung fibroblasts. In contrast to several different types of cells, including human skin and gingival lung fibroblasts(32.Krusius T. Gehlsen K.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13120-13125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fetal rat lung fibroblasts did not synthesize the small soluble proteoglycan, decorin. Cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells(27.Järveläinen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23274-23281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human umbical vein endothelial cells(27.Järveläinen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23274-23281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and rat pleural mesothelial cells (33.Milligan S.A. Owens M.W. Henderson Jr., R.J. Grimes Jr., S.R. Exp. Lung Res. 1995; 21: 559-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have also been found to express biglycan but not decorin. The lack of decorin synthesis may be due to the use of primary cell cultures, because the human embryonic lung fibroblast cell line, HFL-1, has been shown to synthesize decorin(34.Romaris M. Heredia A. Molist A. Bassols A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1093: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although cell culture findings should be interpreted with caution, it is likely that the absence of decorin synthesis has a functional role in late fetal lung development. It should be noted that under similar experimental conditions as used for fetal rat lung fibroblasts, fetal rat skin fibroblasts expressed decorin. Thus, it is unlikely that the decorin gene is silenced by methylation of the control regions in isolated fetal lung fibroblasts. The exact role of soluble PGs is unknown, but they have been implicated in cell adhesion. Soluble PGs may inhibit cell adhesion to fibronectin and collagen by binding to the GAG binding site of these matrix molecules, thus making it inaccessible to the cell surface PGs(4.Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 229-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 5.Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble as well as membrane- and matrix-bound small PGs may also play a role in the control of cell proliferation. Increasing evidence suggests that small PGs control TGF-β bioactivity by sequestering TGF-β in the extracellular matrix(9.Yamaguchi Y. Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 11.Hildebrand A. Romaris M. Rasmussen L.M. Heinegard D. Twardzik D.R. Border W.A. Ruoslahti E. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). The larger membrane- and matrix-associated PGs have also been implicated in binding and regulating the bioactivity of several growth factors(7.Klagsburn M. Baird A. Cell. 1991; 67: 229-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 35.Fager G. Camejo G. Bondjers G. In Vitro Cell & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 168-175Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 36.Roberts R. Gallagher J. Spooncer E. Allen T.D. Bloomfield F. Dexter T.M. Nature. 1988; 332: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the binding of growth factors to extracellular matrices is of general significance and may explain the growth-promoting or inhibiting activities of extracellular matrices (5.Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported growth inhibition of cultured fetal lung fibroblasts in response to elevated oxygen exposure(37.Tanswell A.K. Olson D.M. Freeman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is possible that altered PG production may contribute to this growth inhibition. We found that elevated O2 mainly decreased biglycan synthesis of fetal lung fibroblasts. However, cell-matrix-associated PGs were also affected by elevated O2 concentrations. The results obtained at the protein level were confirmed by mRNA observations. Whether similar changes in proteoglycan production by fetal lung fibroblasts in response to elevated concentrations of O2 occur in vivo remains to be elucidated. Short term exposure of newborn rats to 95% O2 has been reported to decrease the density of PGs in alveolar basement membranes(14.Ferrarra T.B. Fox R.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1992; 6: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In contrast, an increase in biglycan synthesis has been reported in a newborn rat model of chronic hyperoxia-induced lung injury(15.Veness-Meehan K.A. Rhodes D.R. Stiles A.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Increases in hyaluronan and PGs have also been described in animal models of pulmonary fibrosis using N-nitroso-N-methylurethane (38.Cantor J.O. Bray B.A. Ryan S.F. Mandl I. Turino G.M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1980; 164: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or bleomycin (39.Cantor J.O. Osman M. Cerrata J.M. Mandl I. Turino G.M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Invest. 1993; 92: 623-637Google Scholar) and in humans with fibroproliferative lung diseases(41.Bjermer L. Engstrom-Laurent A. Lundgren R. Rosenhall L. Hallgren D.R. Br. Med. J. 1987; 295: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 42.Basset F. Ferrans V.J. Soler P. Takemura T. Fukuda Y. Crystal R.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 122: 443-461PubMed Google Scholar). These animal models of pulmonary fibrosis showed that changes in hyaluronan and PGs occurred prior to collagen accumulation, suggesting that hyaluronan and PG may modulate the later fibrotic response(43.Juul S.E. Wight T.N. Hascall V.C. Crystal R.G. West J.B. The Lung. Raven Press, New York1991: 413-420Google Scholar). Exposure of animals to elevated O2 concentrations has also been shown to increase the amount of lung collagen as well as elastin and fibronectin(44.Durr R.A. Dubaybo B.A. Thet L.A. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1987; 47: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 45.Riley D.J. Kerr J.S. Yu S.Y. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1984; 75: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 46.Moore A. Buch S. Han R.N.N. Freeman B.A. Post M. Tanswell A.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L78-L84PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no studies have reported a temporal relationship of PG and collagen in an O2 toxicity model of pulmonary fibrosis. In the present study, we found that fetal lung fibroblasts increased type I collagen and fibronectin mRNA expression in response to elevated concentrations of O2, suggesting that fetal lung fibroblasts selectively up-regulate and down-regulate gene expression of individual extracellular matrix molecules. The observation that the effect of elevated O2 concentrations on PG and type I collagen gene expression was reversible but that on fibronectin mRNA expression was not strongly supports such selective regulation of extracellular matrix expression by fetal lung fibroblasts in response to O2. The exact mechanism by which oxygen may modulate GAG and PG synthesis of fetal lung fibroblasts is not known. The inhibition of GAG and PG synthesis by 50% O2 is not due to the loss of cell viability, and the cell number remained constant. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that fetal lung fibroblasts developed tolerance to 50% O2, as measured by LDH release(37.Tanswell A.K. Olson D.M. Freeman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly, an alteration of 32SO4 incorporation induced by elevated oxygen is not due to the changes in sulfotransferase activities because [3H]glucosamine incorporation into GAGs was also altered. The toxic effects of oxygen are believed to be initiated through increased intracellular generation of partially reduced oxygen species. Superoxide, generated by the action of xanthine oxidase on hypoxanthine, has been reported to decrease the synthesis of PGs in cultured bovine chondrocytes(16.Panasyuk A. Frati E. Ribeault D.

Superoxide also damaged PG molecules at the level of the core protein, while GAG side chains were resistant to free radical attack(16.Panasyuk A. Frati E. Ribeault D. Mitriovic D. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1994; 16: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the present study, we did not investigate whether elevated concentrations of O2 damaged intact PGs synthesized by fetal lung fibroblasts. However, the parallel decreases in PG mRNA and 32SO4 incorporation into PGs make it unlikely that the observed decrease in PGs is due to such an action by reactive oxygen species. Consistent with our findings, superoxide has been shown to increase collagen synthesis in the human fetal fibroblast cell line, IMR-90(49.Chandrakasan G. Bhatnagar R.S. Cell. Mol. Biol.
