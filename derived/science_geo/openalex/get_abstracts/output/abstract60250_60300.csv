https://openalex.org/W1600978980,"Abstract An improved, simplified, and greatly shortened isolation procedure for metallothionein from tissue extracts using gel filtration (Sephadex G-50) and DEAE-cellulose chromatography is presented. When isolated by this procedure, the molecular weight of both the liver and kidney metalloproteins is found to be about 6600, as determined by equilibrium centrifugation and gel filtration. The amino acid composition of both proteins is also closely similar. Their distinctive features include the extremely high content of cysteine which comprises about 33% of all amino acid residues, and the absence of phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and histidine. In addition, both proteins show substantial microheterogeneity even when isolated from the organ(s) of a single animal. Based on a molecular weight of 6000, the nearest integral composition for a total of 61 amino acids is Lys6 Arg1 Asp3 Thr2 Ser7 Glu3 Pro3 Gly6 Ala6 Cys20 Val2 Met1 for both renal and hepatic proteins. All 20 cysteinyl residues are titratable with silver ions and hence the protein contains no disulfide bonds. The total metal content consisting of cadmium, zinc, and copper is close to 6 g atoms per mole for both liver and kidney metallothioneins; the liver protein contains predominantly zinc whereas that from kidney contains more cadmium. Thus, for each metal atom bound on the average 3 cysteinyl residues are available for binding."

This adaptation is associated with characteristic tail behavior and rapid tail regeneration. There is no facultative metabolic increase associated with tail regeneration, and energy normally allocated to body growth and maintenance is diverted to tail regeneration. This supports the contention that tail behavior, autotomy, and rapid regeneration evolved as mechanisms promoting survival in terms of predator escape."
https://openalex.org/W1536009441,"Abstract A new enzyme splitting the ribose-ribose bonds of poly-(adenosine diphosphate ribose) was purified 200-fold from calf thymus. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 48,000 by gel filtration and 53,000 by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Its optimum pH was around 7.5. For full activity 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol was required. Activity was inhibited considerably by 10 µm p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate or HgCl2. The Km value for poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) was 0.58 µm. Adenosine cyclic 3' : 5'-monophosphate and adenosine diphosphate ribose inhibited the reaction, causing 50% inhibition at concentrations of 0.3 mm and 1.1 mm, respectively. Calf thymus histone f2a, f2b, and f3, protamine, and poly-l-lysine inhibited the activity. The inhibition by histone f2a was reversed by DNA. The enzyme hydrolyzed poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) in a fashion of an exoglycosidase. The end product of hydrolysis is adenosine diphosphate ribose. This enzyme may function in regulation of the chain length of poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose), which was previously claimed to play a role in DNA synthesis or in the structure of chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W1483636461,"Abstract Uptake of 2-deoxy-d-glucose in cultured chick embryo fibroblasts consists of two reactions, transport and phosphorylation (Kletzien, R. F., and Perdue, J. F. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 711–719). Further studies were initiated to examine in greater detail the mechanism of sugar uptake and to determine which of the two reactions was responsible for the differing rates of 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake between rapidly and slowly growing cells. The uptake of 2-deoxy-d-glucose was studied as a function of time and substrate concentration to establish the conditions under which the phosphorylation of the sugar parallels uptake. The initial rates of phosphorylation of 2-deoxy-d-glucose in intact cells were dependent on the rate of cell growth. However, the initial rates of phosphorylation in cellular homogenates prepared from rapidly and slowly growing cells were identical and were 4 to 6 times greater than the rates observed in intact cells. Experiments with cytochalasin B, a sugar transport inhibitor, demonstrated that an inhibition of transport was always paralleled by an equal inhibition of sugar phosphorylation. These data indicate that a reaction prior to phosphorylation is responsible for the altered rates of sugar uptake in rapidly and slowly growing cells and that this same reaction limits the rate at which 2-deoxyglucose is phosphorylated in intact cells at early time points. The kinetic constants for the uptake and phosphorylation of 2-deoxy-d-glucose and the inhibition of this uptake and phosphorylation by competing sugars were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. The Km for sugar uptake was constant at 2 mm; the Vmax was 16.7 or 33.2 nmoles per mg of protein per min, depending on the rate of cell growth. The Km for sugar phosphorylation in cellular homogenates was 0.8 mm; the Vmax was 75 nmoles per mg of protein per min and was not dependent on the rate of cell growth. The Ki values for the competitive inhibition of 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake in intact cells and phosphorylation in cellular homogenates by d-glucose were 2 and 0.18 mm, respectively. 3-O-Methyl-d-glucose competitively inhibited 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake with a Ki of 17 to 20 mm. The kinetic constants for 3-O-methyl-d-glucose uptake and inhibition of uptake by d-glucose were also calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. The Km for 3-O-methyl-glucose uptake was 3.5 to 5.0 mm, and the Vmax was 19 or 37.5 nmoles per mg of protein per min, depending on the rate of cell growth. The Ki for d-glucose inhibition of uptake was 1.8 mm. These results demonstrate that 2-deoxy-d-glucose, 3-O-methyl-d-glucose, and d-glucose are all transported by the same site, that sugar transport is the rate-limiting step in sugar uptake, and that sugar transport is a reaction distinct from phosphorylation. The latter conclusion was further substantiated by the finding that hexokinase was not associated with isolated plasma membrane. The difference in the rate of uptake of 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 3-O-methyl-d-glucose between rapidly growing and slowly growing cells was strictly attributed to differences in the Vmax for sugar transport; the Km for transport did not change with the rate of cell growth. Activation energies for the sugar transport reaction were calculated from Arrhenius plots and were found to be identical for rapidly and slowly growing cells, a result which is consistent with the interpretation that the increase in Vmax in rapidly growing cells is the result of a greater number of sugar transport sites."

https://openalex.org/W2023811614,"Cooling populations of newly formed mouse human heterokaryons has effects on the intermixing of mouse and human surface antigens which indicate the occurrence of phase separations in membrane lipids. Antigen mixing, previously shown to be due to diffusion in the plane of the membrane, is retarded when cells are cooled from 37° to 21°C, but is then speeded by further cooling to 15°C. This result is in accord with observations on phase separations of lipids in artificial and bacterial membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1997555701,Oral administration of 1 gram of melatonin caused rapid and significant elevations of serum human growth hormone in eight out of nine normal male subjects. The mean (+/- standard error of the mean) of the peak response by growth hormone was 22.9 +/- 4.6 microunits per milliliter. The increased secretion of growth hormone may be due to interaction of melatonin with hypothalamic serotoninergic receptors.
https://openalex.org/W1562500526,"Abstract During the period of morphogenesis of the rat pancreas, the specific exocrine enzymes accumulation pattern from Day 13 through Day 14 to as late as Day 15 is a low and constant basal level of each specific protein (the protodifferentiated level). Subsequently, the levels of the exocrine enzymes increase dramatically. The specific activities of chymotrypsin(ogen), trypsin(ogen), (pro)carboxypeptidase A and B, and amylase increase approximately 1000-fold (differentiated stage). The inflection point of the typically sigmoid accumulation (plotted logarithmically) of the different enzymes occurs between 16½ and 18½ days. The initiation of these increases is not temporally coincident for all the proteins nor do the changes in specific activity of the enzymes appear to be coordinate. The levels of the enzymes in the adult pancreas average from several fold less to several fold more than those present in that of the newborn animal. Addition of agents implicated in altering the quantity of chymotrypsin and amylase in the adult animal have no effect on the in vitro embryonic accretion of these enzymes. Thus the levels appear to be independently modulated by unknown factors. Determinations in embryonic and adult tissues other than pancreas indicate that (pro)carboxypeptidase A activity is present in significant quantity only in the pancreas. In all cases, specific activities are considerably less than that of the pancreatic protodifferentiated level. This substantiates the existence of a protodifferentiated stage in pancreatic development. Enzyme assay of explants following organ culture of 13-day pancreatic rudiments yields a profile of specific protein accumulation coincident with that observed in vivo. Measurements of rates of biosynthesis of exocrine enzymes in vitro demonstrate a 30- to 60-fold increase during the developmental period studied (13 to 19 days). Inclusion of actinomycin D or 5-bromodeoxyuridine in vitro during the protodifferentiated period results in 90% inhibition of subsequent appearance of enzyme activity or biosynthesis (or both). Treatment at later times with these antimetabolites produces a progressively smaller effect. These results suggest that a DNA-linked process and, subsequently, RNA synthesis are required for expression of differentiated character. A multiphasic model of regulation in pancreatic organogenesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1552067421,"Abstract The addition of fetal calf serum to the culture medium of chick embryo fibroblasts resulted in a biphasic increase in the rate of 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake. The first increase in the rate of sugar uptake occurred within 10 min of serum addition and was not blocked by cycloheximide. A second increase in the rate of transport was noted by 1 hour following serum addition, and the increase continued for about 5 hours. The second increase was blocked by cycloheximide, but neither increase was blocked by actinomycin D. Transport rather than phosphorylation was responsible for the serum-stimulated increase in 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake. No difference could be detected in the level of hexokinase activity between fibroblasts in serum-deficient medium and those in serum-containing medium. Studies with the transport inhibitor, cytochalasin B, indicated that transport was the rate-limiting step in 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake at early time points. Analysis of the initial rates of 2-deoxy-d-glucose or 3-O-methyl-d-glucose transport by Lineweaver-Burk plots showed that increases in sugar uptake following the addition of fetal calf serum to the culture medium were due to increases in the Vmax for transport, with the Km remaining constant."

https://openalex.org/W1481404721,Abstract An N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase which is present in the plasma only of individuals of blood groups A and AB was found to adsorb to agarose gel beads. The binding could be reversed by addition of uridine nucleotides. These properties appear to be unique characteristics of this enzyme among glycosyltransferases and other proteins in human plasma. The enzyme probably binds to an inhibitor of the glycosyltransferase reaction which is present in the agarose. The specific binding exhibited by this transferase allowed an essentially one-step purification of the enzyme to be achieved by a simple adsorption to agarose and elution with UDP.

Approximately 0.35 mg of enzyme was isolated from 63 mg of cores. Preparations of [3H]leucine-labeled deoxyribonuclease appeared nearly homogeneous as judged by gel filtration and had a molecular weight of 50,000 as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The molecular weight of the native enzyme determined by sucrose gradient sedimentation and filtration through Sephadex G-200 was 105,000, suggesting that it may exist as a dimer. The enzyme hydrolyzed single-stranded DNA most actively at pH 4.4 and did not require divalent cations."

https://openalex.org/W1591957236,"Abstract Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity is stimulated maximally in mouse mammary epithelial cells in culture in the presence of insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin. Insulin, by itself, is a potent stimulus, whereas both hydrocortisone and prolactin require insulin for manifestation of their effects. Time course studies of the change in enzyme activity show that insulin produces approximately a 100% increase in the enzyme activity during the first 48 hours and that thereafter the activity decreases rapidly to the basal level. Addition of prolactin to the insulin-containing medium effects a larger increase up to about 200%, but after 2 days in culture the activity again declines markedly. Hydrocortisone, together with insulin, increases the activity by about 250% and maintains this high level for 4 days in culture. Such an effect of hydrocortisone is also manifested in the presence of insulin and prolactin, and results in a maximal increase in the enzyme activity. The ability of hydrocortisone to facilitate a high level of enzyme activity is mimicked by spermidine, but not by spermine, putrescine, or magnesium ion. Spermidine is effective at a concentration as low as 4 x 10-4 m, which is within the physiological range. This effect of spermidine is specific for hydrocortisone since spermidine does not simulate the effect of either insulin or prolactin."
https://openalex.org/W2165122055,"Abstract The sugar transport system in the human red cell is highly asymmetric: the Km and Vmax for efflux are more than 20 times greater than those for influx. Sugar influx is accelerated up to 40-fold by increasing amounts of intracellular sugar, while efflux is increased on 2-fold by extracellular sugar. These distinct trans effects suggest that the sugar carrier has at least two sites for sugar which sit on opposite sides of the membrane but which are sensitive to the state of saturation at the trans face. These results are sufficient to explain the aspects of transport kinetics previously considered as anomalies. The pH dependence of efflux, influx, and exchange transport are also presented. They too provide evidence for more than one type of binding site for sugar."

Uptake by the normal cell lines was mediated by both sodium-dependent and sodium-independent mechanisms. This uptake remained constant as the cells were passed in culture. Uptake by the patient's cells was found to decrease with passage in culture until a stable culture was obtained. The stable culture was found to lack sodiumdependent uptake of isoleucine and to be ouabain-insensitive. Studies in this cell line represent the first report of altered amino acid uptake in a fibroblast culture associated with altered amino acid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1507593876,"Abstract The distance between enzyme-bound Mn(II) at the active site of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase and the protons of bound substrate or inhibitor was determined in ternary and quaternary enzyme complexes. In particular, the NMR relaxation rates of pyruvate protons effected by bound Mn(II) were measured for (a) the ternary pyruvate kinase-Mn(II)-pyruvate complex; (b) the abortive quaternary complex containing ADP as the fourth component; and (c) the quaternary complex containing ATP as the fourth component, i.e. the equilibrium mixture. The relaxation rates of the three proton resonances of the inhibitor, α-(dihydroxyphosphinylmethyl)acrylate, the methylene analog of P-enolpyruvate, were measured for the ternary enzyme-Mn(II)-inhibitor complex. Longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) NMR relaxation times were measured as a function of temperature and of Mn(II) concentration. Relaxation times were measured at two frequencies, 220 and 60 MHz, so that the correlation time and subsequently the distance of the substrate or inhibitor protons from the paramagnetic Mn(II) could be determined. The correlation time for all the pyruvate ternary and quaternary complexes was found to be 3.5 ± 1.2 x 10-9 s when determined from the T1:T2 ratio for the pyruvate resonance, and to be 2.7 x 10-9 s when determined from the frequency dependence of T1. The Mn(II) to pyruvate-proton distance of 8.2 ± 0.5 A is too large to accommodate a structure with direct Mn(II) coordination to pyruvate. The calculated distance is consistent with a structure in which the pyruvate is in the second coordination sphere of the Mn(II) bound to the enzyme. The correlation time for the ternary complex with the inhibitor, α-(dihydroxyphosphinylmethyl)acrylate, was found to be 1.0 x 10-9 s from the frequency dependence of T1. The distance from Mn(II), determined to be 5.3 A to the methylene protons, 6.5 A to one vinyl proton, and 6.2 A to the other vinyl proton, provides evidence that the ternary P-enolpyruvate analog complex involves coordination of the phosphinyl group to Mn(II) bound to the enzyme. Although binding experiments indicate that P-enolpyruvate and α-(dihydroxyphosphinylmethyl)acrylate compete for the same site on pyruvate kinase in the ternary complex, water proton relaxation rate data and EPR spectra show that the methylene analog of P-enolpyruvate forms a very different ternary complex than P-enolpyruvate. Consequently an extrapolation from the structure of the inhibitor complex to that of the substrate P-enolpyruvate is questionable."

https://openalex.org/W128681742,"Abstract Inactivation of the glucose transport carrier activities of isolated human erythrocyte membranes by 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (FDNB) was studied in the presence and the absence of d-glucose and correlated with accompanying dinitrophenylation of the membrane components. The inactivation was greatly enhanced by the presence of the sugar. Furthermore, the kinetics of inactivation in the presence of of the sugar differed from that seen in the absence of the sugar. In the absence of glucose, the inactivation was first order with respect to FDNB and had an activation energy of 32 Cal per mole. In the presence of the sugar, the inactivation was nearly second order with respect to FDNB and had an activation energy of 17 Cal per mole. The pH dependence of the inactivation was also significantly modified by the presence of the sugar. Neither the total amount of dinitrophenylation nor the kinetics of this process was significantly altered by the presence of the sugar. The kinetics of dinitrophenylation was similar to the kinetics of the inactivation in the absence of the sugar, but significantly different from that in the presence of the sugar. The inactivation of the glucose carrier by FDNB involves at least two mutually distinct reactivities of the carrier, namely glucose-independent and glucose-dependent dinitrophenylations. These reactivities may represent two different conformational states of the carrier in its operation."

https://openalex.org/W1485827550,"Abstract The primary route of CO2 incorporation in C-4 plants (corn) has been formulated to be β-carboxylation catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, while in C-3 plants (spinach) CO2 enters the carboxyl carbon of glycerate 3-phosphate after reacting with ribulose 1,5-diphosphate. Detached leaf tissues of spinach and corn were compared with respect to their fixation of CO2 in the dark or in the light subsequent to illumination in the absence of CO2 in order to accumulate the primary compound for carboxylation. Prior illumination of corn and spinach leaves in an atmosphere of N2 containing 1.5% O2, enhanced dark 14CO2 fixation 15- to 25-fold over that of unilluminated leaves. In corn the primary products (80%) of enhanced dark fixation were malate and aspartate. Less than 5% of the incorporated 14CO2 appeared in glycerate 3-phosphate and other intermediates of the reductive pentose phosphate cycle. In spinach, roughly one-half of the isotope was found in glycerate 3-phosphate and sugar phosphates with about 25% in alanine. The levels of ribulose 1,5-diphosphate, glycerate 3-phosphate, and phosphoenolpyruvate were determined during preillumination under an atmosphere containing N2 and 1.5% O2, after pulses of CO2 either in a light or in a dark period. In both tissues ribulose 1,5-diphosphate increased linearly during preillumination and decreased rapidly following the introduction of CO2. Glycerate 3-phosphate was little affected during preillumination but increased rapidly upon addition of CO2. In both species the level of phosphoenolpyruvate was essentially unchanged during preillumination but increased sharply in corn leaves with introduction of CO2. CO2 pulses had no effect on the level of phosphoenolpyruvate in spinach leaves. It was concluded that ribulose 1,5-diphosphate can serve as a primary acceptor of CO2 in detached leaves of C-4 (corn) and C-3 plants (spinach)."
https://openalex.org/W1997036154,"One may conclude that it is impractical to confine oneself to any one analytical method since ever more sensitive instrumentation continues to be produced. However, in certain methods such as anodic stripping voltammetry and flameless atomic absorption it may be background contamination from reagent impurities and surroundings rather than instrument sensitivity which controls the limits of element detection. The problem of contamination from dust or glassware is greatly magnified when the sample size becomes ever smaller. Air entering laboratories near highways may contain trace quantities of lead, cadmium, barium, antimony, and other elements from engine exhaust. Even plastic materials contacting the sample may be suspect as a source of contamination since specific metals may be used as catalysts in the synthesis of the plastic and traces may be retained in it. Certain elements may even be deliberately added to plastics during manufacture for identification purposes. Nondestructive methods such as neutron activation and x-ray techniques thus offer great advantages not only in time but in the elimination of impurities introduced during sample ashing. Future improvements in attainable limits of detection may arise largely from progress in the ultrapurification of reagents and ""clean-room"" techniques. Finally, the competence of the analyst is also vitally important in the skillful operation of modern complex analytical instrumentation and in the experienced evaluation of data."

This was accomplished by incubation of FSH in 8 m urea at 37° for 20 hours followed by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-50. This resulted in complete separation of the subunits. The individual subunits were purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 columns. The results of the physicochemical characterization studies indicated that these subunits were nonidentical. Both α and β had a high threonine and glutamic acid content, but differed in the content of other amino acids. The sum of the amino acid contents of the two subunits agreed well with the amino acid composition of the intact FSH. The molecular weights of the subunits were similar, each being approximately 16,000. There was dissimilarity in the electrophoretic mobilities, although both subunits exhibited microheterogeneity. Examination of the carbohydrate content showed that the β subunit contained approximately 5% more total carbohydrate than did the α subunit. Biological activity was absent in each of the subunits, but after recombination 56% of the original FSH activity was recovered. The α subunits of equine FSH, human FSH, and human chorionic gonadotropin showed great similarity, suggesting homology.

https://openalex.org/W1587940298,"Abstract This laboratory has previously reported the use of 4,4'-bis-dimethylaminodiphenylcarbinol as a highly sensitive reagent for the quantitative determination of sulfhydryl residues in proteins. The reagent dissociates in buffers below pH 6.5 to form a resonance-stabilized carbonium-immonium ion which exhibits an absorption maximum centered around 606 nm. Sulfhydryl residues react with this cation form of the reagent to form stable S-(4,4'-bis-dimethylaminodiphenylmethyl-) derivatives with a concomitant quantitative loss in absorbance. Incubation of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (l-malate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.37) from porcine heart with a 20-fold molar excess of the reagent over enzyme leads to a time-dependent loss of enzymatic activity which is complete within approximately 30 min. Inactivation is coincident with the incorporation of approximately 1 mole of reagent per enzymatic active center of the enzyme. The presence of the coenzyme, NAD+, fully protects the enzyme from inactivation and the modification of cysteine residues, suggesting interaction at or near the coenzyme binding site. The modified mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase was digested with trypsin and a peptide containing the active center cysteine was isolated. Due to a unique aggregation phenomenon exhibited by the peptide modified with this reagent, isolation was achieved in a single step of chromatography on Sephadex G-100. These studies are suggestive that this reagent may be widely applicable for the selective chemical modification of active center cysteines in proteins and that peptides containing this reagent can be isolated in an extremely simple manner."

An estimated 90000 new cases and 33000 deaths will occur as a result of this disease in 1974. The death rate has remained constant for 35 years; it is estimated that 1 women in 15 will develop the disease in her lifetime. The Breast Cancer Task Force (BCTF) conducts most of the research. Risk indicators so far identified include: incidence is 5-6 times higher in North America and Northern Europe than in most of Asia and Africa; incidence increases with age; daughters and sisters of patients are 2-3 times more likely to develop the disease; risks were 6-9 times greater if occurring before menopause and involving both breasts; heredity and environment may be involved. Pregnancy before age 30 may decrease risk; having a first child after 30 increases the risk. Female sex hormones may be involved. Both early onset of menstruation and late cessation are associated with increased risk. None of the studies show association between contraceptive pills and breast cancer; however these pills have been in widespread use for less than 10 years while estimated time for development of most cancers is 15-20 years. Prolactin a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland may be essential for development of breast cancer in mice and rats. Viruses are a known cause of breast cancer in mice. Many investigators think a similar virus may be involved in human mammary cancer but proof remains elusive. Biochemical evidence indicates the presence of oncogenic RNA viruses (oncornaviruses) in human milk but in addition to substances that destroy virus particles human milk contains the enzyme ribonuclease which interfers with biochemical tests for oncornaviruses. In cultured cells derived from patients with carcinoma of the breast a virus similar to oncornavirus has been found. That human mammary cancer is transmitted as it is in certain strains of mice by an agent in the milk has not been shown. Although breast feeding has declined in the United States in the past 50-60 years incidence of breast cancer has not decreased. Most investigators think that viruses are not only factor in carcinogenesis. Although a vaccine made from killed mouse virus prevents mouse mammary tumors such an approach is not feasible for human use. In 80% of cases diagnosed before metastases occur patients live 5 years or longer whereas only 45% of those diagnosed later do so. Mass screening by clinical examination and mammography is recommended. Using this procedure 70% of detected cancers have not metastasized. Also thermography may indicate changes in circulation confirming diagnosis or revealing other tumors. Primary treatment is surgery sometimes accompanied by radiation. Chemotherapy removal of ovaries adrenals or pituitary glands may follow if recurrences are found. Extent of the orignial surgery and radiation is controversial. About 30% of breast cancer cases are alive and free of the disease 10 years after diagnosis a figure which has remained constant for 35 years. Only systemic treatment can reach tumor cells in other parts of the body. Hormonal therapy removing the source of hormone or preventing its action is effective in less than half the cases. Chemotherapy at the time of original surgery is also now used.
