Here, we show that Sox2 increases and estrogen reduces the expression of the transcription factor Sox9. Gain and loss of function assays indicate that Sox9 is implicated in the maintenance of human breast luminal progenitor cells. CRISPR/Cas knockout of Sox9 reduces growth of tamoxifen-resistant breast tumours in vivo. Mechanistically, Sox9 acts downstream of Sox2 to control luminal progenitor cell content and is required for expression of the cancer stem cell marker ALDH1A3 and Wnt signalling activity. Sox9 is elevated in breast cancer patients after endocrine therapy failure. This new regulatory axis highlights the relevance of SOX family transcription factors as potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer."

Although macrophages were reported to be an important mediator of BRONJ, the detailed potential mechanism of BRONJ remains unclear. Here, we reported an elevated TLR-4 expression in macrophages under action of zoledronic acid (ZA), resulting in enhanced M1 macrophage polarization and decreased M2 macrophage polarization both in vitro and in vivo. After inhibiting the TLR-4 signaling pathway, the activation of the TLR-4/NF-κB signaling pathway and the induction of NF-κB nuclear translocation and production of proinflammatory cytokines by ZA were suppressed in macrophages, thereby inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization. By utilizing the TLR-4−/− mice, development of BRONJ was markedly ameliorated, and M1 macrophages were significantly attenuated in the extraction socket tissues in the TLR-4−/− mice. Importantly, the systemic administration of the TLR-4 inhibitor TAK-242 improved the wound healing of the extraction socket and decreased the incidence rate of BRONJ. Taken together, our findings suggest that TLR-4-mediated macrophage polarization participates in the pathogenesis of BRONJ in mice, and TLR-4 may be a potential target for the prevention and therapeutic treatment of BRONJ.—Zhu, W., Xu, R., Du, J., Fu, Y., Li, S., Zhang, P., Liu, L., Jiang, H.

https://openalex.org/W2951788718,"Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, vaccine effectiveness has been low to moderate in recent years and vaccine coverage remains low, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Supplementary methods of prevention should be explored to reduce the high burden of influenza. A potential target is the respiratory tract microbiome, complex microbial communities which envelop the respiratory epithelium and play an important role in shaping host immunity. Using a household transmission study, we examined whether the nose/throat microbiota was associated with influenza susceptibility among participants exposed to influenza virus in the household. Further, we characterized changes in the nose/throat microbiota to explore whether community stability was influenced by influenza virus infection. Using a generalized linear mixed effects model, we found a nasal/oropharyngeal community state type (CST) associated with decreased susceptibility to influenza. The CST was rare and transitory among young children but a prevalent and stable CST among adults. Using boosting and linear mixed effects models, we found associations between the nose/throat microbiota and influenza also existed at the taxa level, specifically with the relative abundance of Alloprevotella, Prevotella, and Bacteroides oligotypes. We found high rates of change between bacterial community states among both secondary cases and household contacts who were not infected during follow up. Further work is needed to separate the effect of influenza virus infection from the considerable short-term changes that occur even in the absence of virus. Lastly, age was strongly associated with susceptibility to influenza and the nose/throat bacterial community structure. Although additional studies are needed to determine causality, our results suggest the nose/throat microbiome may be a potential target for reducing the burden of influenza."

In response to pathogen invasion, the human host limits iron availability. Although canonical examples of nutritional immunity are host strategies that limit pathogen access to Fe(III), little is known about how the host restricts access to another biologically relevant oxidation state of this metal, Fe(II). This redox species is prevalent at certain infection sites and is utilized by bacteria during chronic infection, suggesting that Fe(II) withholding by the host may be an effective but unrecognized form of nutritional immunity. Here, we report that human calprotectin (CP; S100A8/S100A9 or MRP8/MRP14 heterooligomer) inhibits iron uptake and induces an iron starvation response in Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells by sequestering Fe(II) at its unusual His6 site. Moreover, under aerobic conditions in which the Fe(III) oxidation state is favored, Fe(II) withholding by CP was enabled by (i) its ability to stabilize this redox state in solution and (ii) the production and secretion of redox-active, P. aeruginosa–produced phenazines, which reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II). Analyses of the interplay between P. aeruginosa secondary metabolites and CP indicated that Fe(II) withholding alters P. aeruginosa physiology and expression of virulence traits. Lastly, examination of the effect of CP on cell-associated metal levels in diverse human pathogens revealed that CP inhibits iron uptake by several bacterial species under aerobic conditions. This work implicates CP-mediated Fe(II) sequestration as a component of nutritional immunity in both aerobic and anaerobic milieus during P. aeruginosa infection.

Iron is an essential nutrient for the vast majority of microbial pathogens that cause human disease (1Cassat J.E. Skaar E.P.

This metal ion can exist in several oxidation states, and microbes can acquire both the ferrous (+2) and ferric (+3) forms. During infection, the mammalian innate immune system limits the availability of iron and other essential metals to starve microbes and thus limit their growth in a process termed “nutritional immunity” (2Weinberg E.D.

In contrast, the possibility of Fe(II) withholding by the innate immune system has been largely overlooked. Although Fe(II) can be abundant at chronic infection sites (7Hunter R.C. Asfour F.

We discovered that human calprotectin (CP; 4The abbreviations used are: CPcalprotectinCFcystic fibrosisFurferric uptake regulatorsRNAsmall RNAβMEβ-mercaptoethanolICPinductively coupled plasmaPCAphenazine-1-carboxylatePYOpyocyaninqPCRquantitative PCRCDMchemically defined mediumTSBtryptic soy brothAQ2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinoloneLBLuria-Bertani medium. S100A8/S100A9 or MRP8/MRP14 oligomer), a metal-sequestering protein well-known for withholding Mn(II) and Zn(II), coordinates Fe(II) with high affinity and has the capacity to inhibit microbial iron acquisition under reducing conditions (9Nakashige T.G.

This initial work allowed us to propose a new hypothesis that CP is an unrecognized player in the iron-withholding innate immune response in reducing or anaerobic environments where Fe(II) is available. Nevertheless, this initial study did not directly link the observed inhibition of iron acquisition to host-defense function because the 55Fe-uptake assay designed and used was performed under conditions where CP did not exert bacteriostatic activity (9Nakashige T.G. Zhang B. Krebs C. Nolan E.M. Human calprotectin is an iron-sequestering host-defense protein.Nat. Chem.

The antimicrobial activity of CP has historically only been attributed to its ability to sequester two essential metals, manganese and zinc; however, in addition to our study of Fe(II), recent work has revealed that CP is also capable of withholding additional nutrient metals, including nickel and copper (10Zygiel E.M. Nolan E.M. Transition metal sequestration by the host-defense protein calprotectin.Annu. Rev.

Taken together, these studies indicate that CP is functionally versatile, that the metal ions sequestered by CP must be considered on a case-by-case basis, and that CP function will depend on metal availability at an infection site. From a structural standpoint, CP is a heterooligomer of the Ca(II)-binding polypeptides S100A8 and S100A9. Each CP heterodimer has two transition metal–binding sites that form at the S100A8/S100A9 interface: a His3Asp motif (site 1) and a His6 motif (site 2) (11Korndörfer I.P. Brueckner F. Skerra A.

Prior to our observations that CP chelates Fe(II) and can inhibit microbial iron uptake, several published reports indicated that CP cannot bind iron and thus concluded that the protein cannot be involved in iron homeostasis (12Damo S.M.

As a result, our initial report of Fe(II) withholding by CP and a new hypothesis sparked some debate in the literature, and several publications posited that Fe(II) binding by CP is irrelevant to its antimicrobial activity (19Garcia Y.M.

The uncertainty surrounding the role of CP in iron homeostasis has arisen from these factors as well as the fact that Fe(II) is highly susceptible to oxidation to form Fe(III) under aerobic or oxidative conditions (22Pantopoulos K. Porwal S.K. Tartakoff A. Devireddy L. Mechanisms of mammalian iron homeostasis.Biochemistry. 2012; 51 (22703180): 5705-572410.1021/bi300752rCrossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Our initial study found that CP has negligible affinity for Fe(III) (9Nakashige T.G. Zhang B. Krebs C. Nolan E.M. Human calprotectin is an iron-sequestering host-defense protein.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11 (26302479): 765-77110.1038/nchembio.1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), indicating that it cannot sequester Fe(III) from microbes. Thus, our early analyses suggested that CP-mediated limitation of iron would only occur in anaerobic or reducing environments where we expect Fe(II) to be the dominant oxidation state. Nonetheless, more recent work has shown that CP stabilizes the Fe(II) oxidation state and shifts the redox speciation of iron from Fe(III) to Fe(II) under aerobic conditions and in the absence of an exogenous reductant (23Nakashige T.G. Nolan E.M. Human calprotectin affects the redox speciation of iron.Metallomics. 2017; 9 (28561859): 1086-109510.1039/C7MT00044HCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also obtained preliminary evidence that microbial metabolites that affect iron speciation in solution, in particular Fe(III)-sequestering siderophores and redox-cycling phenazines, can enhance or inhibit Fe(II) sequestration by CP under aerobic conditions (23Nakashige T.G. Nolan E.M. Human calprotectin affects the redox speciation of iron.Metallomics. 2017; 9 (28561859): 1086-109510.1039/C7MT00044HCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of these findings, we revised our initial hypothesis and reasoned that Fe(II) sequestration by CP may also occur in aerobic environments. To address the hypothesis that CP can withhold Fe(II) and affect microbial iron homeostasis pathways under aerobic conditions, we examined the consequences of Fe(II) withholding by CP on the physiology and virulence potential of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that has a high metabolic iron requirement. CP levels are markedly increased in advanced cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, a hereditary disease characterized by reduced lung function and chronic P. aeruginosa infection (24Wilkinson M.M.

Iron depletion also induces expression of the PrrF small regulatory RNAs, which reduce the metabolic requirement of P. aeruginosa for iron when this nutrient is limiting (29Wilderman P.J. Sowa N.A.

Moore J.L. Noto M.J. Zhang Y. Singleton M.D. Prentice B.M. Gilston B.A. Doster R.S. Gaddy J.A. Chazin W.J. Caprioli R.M. Skaar E.P.

Commun. 2016; 7 (27301800)1195110.1038/ncomms11951Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), P. aeruginosa provides an excellent model for evaluating the effect of CP on iron-dependent processes that include growth, metabolite production, and virulence potential. In this work, we report that CP affects multiple iron-dependent processes in P. aeruginosa. CP prevents iron uptake and induces an iron starvation response by this pathogen. Moreover, we describe a role for phenazines in CP-mediated iron starvation, and we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa responds to CP by altering the production of iron-regulated virulence traits. Lastly, we look beyond P. aeruginosa and demonstrate that CP can inhibit iron uptake by a range of bacterial pathogens. Together, this work shows that Fe(II) sequestration by CP impacts iron homeostasis in multiple pathogens and supports a role for Fe(II) withholding in nutritional immunity. To evaluate how CP affects metal levels in P. aeruginosa, we quantified cell-associated manganese, iron, nickel, copper, and zinc in two commonly used strains, PAO1 and PA14 (Table S1), grown in the absence or presence of CP (10 μm; ~260 μg/ml). We performed these studies with WT CP and a variant with two Cys → Ser point mutations (S100A8(C42S)/S100A9(C3S)) termed CP-Ser (Table S3) (14Brophy M.B. Hayden J.A. Nolan E.M. Calcium ion gradients modulate the zinc affinity and antibacterial activity of human calprotectin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012; 134 (23082970): 18089-1810010.1021/ja307974eCrossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The mutated Cys residues are distant from the His3Asp and His6 sites, and WT CP and CP-Ser display comparable antimicrobial activities (14Brophy M.B. Hayden J.A. Nolan E.M. Calcium ion gradients modulate the zinc affinity and antibacterial activity of human calprotectin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012; 134 (23082970): 18089-1810010.1021/ja307974eCrossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We decided to use CP-Ser throughout this work because it was used for the majority of reported metal-binding and antimicrobial activity studies of CP. We also performed key experiments with WT CP and in all cases found that both proteins elicited similar results. We cultured PAO1 and PA14 in Tris/tryptic soy broth (TSB), a buffered medium commonly used in antimicrobial activity studies of CP. Throughout this work, Tris/TSB contains a 2 mm Ca(II) supplement and no exogenous reducing agent (e.g. β-mercaptoethanol (βME)). Inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-MS showed that this medium contained ~4 μm iron (Table S4). Following aerobic growth (8 h at 37 °C), we collected the P. aeruginosa cells and quantified the cell-associated metal levels by ICP-MS (Fig. S1). We observed that CP-Ser and WT CP caused an ~1.5-fold reduction in cell-associated iron for PAO1 and PA14 compared with the untreated control, in agreement with previously reported inhibition of P. aeruginosa iron uptake by CP-Ser (Fig. 1A and Fig. S2) (9Nakashige T.G. Zhang B. Krebs C. Nolan E.M. Human calprotectin is an iron-sequestering host-defense protein.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11 (26302479): 765-77110.1038/nchembio.1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The current data show, for the first time, CP-mediated inhibition of iron uptake under aerobic conditions in the absence of an exogenous reductant. A reduction in cell-associated manganese, but not nickel, copper, or zinc, was also observed for both strains (Fig. S3). Next, we evaluated the cell-associated iron levels in PA14 grown in iron-depleted, manganese-depleted, or zinc-depleted Tris/TSB (Table S5 and Fig. 1B). PA14 cultured in iron-depleted medium showed an ~3-fold decrease in cell-associated iron, whereas a negligible change was observed for bacteria cultured in the manganese-depleted or zinc-depleted medium (Fig. 1B). Thus, the similar decrease in cell-associated iron when PA14 is cultured with CP-Ser and in iron-depleted medium indicates that CP is preventing iron uptake by P. aeruginosa via iron sequestration. The His6 site is the high-affinity Fe(II) site (9Nakashige T.G. Zhang B. Krebs C. Nolan E.M. Human calprotectin is an iron-sequestering host-defense protein.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11 (26302479): 765-77110.1038/nchembio.1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and we hypothesized that CP requires this site to withhold iron from P. aeruginosa. We analyzed the cell-associated iron levels of PA14 after growth in the presence of CP-Ser variants that lack one (ΔHis3Asp or ΔHis4) or both (ΔΔ) metal-binding sites (Table S3). Like CP-Ser and WT CP, ΔHis3Asp treatment reduced cell-associated iron levels, whereas ΔHis4 or ΔΔ had negligible effect (Fig. 1C). Thus, the His6 site is required for CP to inhibit iron uptake by P. aeruginosa. In prior work, we observed attenuated PAO1 growth in the presence of CP-Ser and in iron-depleted Tris/TSB (9Nakashige T.G. Zhang B. Krebs C. Nolan E.M. Human calprotectin is an iron-sequestering host-defense protein.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11 (26302479): 765-77110.1038/nchembio.1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed at 30 °C in Tris/TSB supplemented with βME as this reducing agent is commonly added to growth media used in studies of CP (9Nakashige T.G. Zhang B. Krebs C. Nolan E.M. Human calprotectin is an iron-sequestering host-defense protein.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11 (26302479): 765-77110.1038/nchembio.1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Brophy M.B. Hayden J.A. Nolan E.M. Calcium ion gradients modulate the zinc affinity and antibacterial activity of human calprotectin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012; 134 (23082970): 18089-1810010.1021/ja307974eCrossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Guided by the metal-uptake studies described above, we reanalyzed the growth-inhibitory activity of CP-Ser and the metal dependence of P. aeruginosa growth at 37 °C and in the absence of an exogenous reductant. Under these conditions, CP-Ser inhibited growth of PAO1 and PA14 (Fig. 1D and Fig. S4). Attenuated P. aeruginosa growth also occurred in iron-depleted Tris/TSB but not in manganese- or zinc-depleted medium (Fig. 1D and Fig. S4). Thus, although CP-Ser inhibited manganese uptake by PAO1 and PA14 during growth in Tris/TSB (Fig. S3), Mn(II) withholding alone cannot account for the growth-inhibitory activity of CP against P. aeruginosa under these conditions. Phenazines are redox-cycling secondary metabolites that P. aeruginosa secretes into the extracellular space. By reducing extracellular Fe(III) to Fe(II), phenazines make Fe(II) available as an iron source for P. aeruginosa in environments where Fe(III) normally predominates (35Wang Y. Newman D.K. Redox reactions of phenazine antibiotics with ferric (hydr)oxides and molecular oxygen.Environ. Sci. Technol. 2008; 42 (18504969): 2380-238610.1021/es702290aCrossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether phenazines produced by P. aeruginosa promote Fe(II) withholding by CP in culture, we examined cell-associated iron levels in a Δphz mutant of PA14 lacking the operons phzA1-G1 and phzA2-G2 (Table S1) (36Dietrich L.E. Price-Whelan A. Petersen A. Whiteley M. Newman D.K. The phenazine pyocyanin is a terminal signalling factor in the quorum sensing network of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Mol.

The enzymes encoded by phzA1-G1 and phzA2-G2 catalyze the conversion of chorismate to phenazine-1-carboxylate (PCA), which is a biosynthetic precursor to other phenazines including pyocyanin (PYO). Thus, the Δphz mutant cannot produce phenazines"

The proposed model achieved better performance, measured by Harrell’s concordance index, than the Estimated Post Transplant Survival model used in the kidney allocation system in the U.S., and other models published recently in the literature. The model has a five-year concordance index of 0.724 (in comparison, the concordance index is 0.697 for the Estimated Post Transplant Survival model, the state of the art currently in use). It combines predictions from random survival forests with a Cox proportional hazards model. The rankings of importance for the model’s variables differ by transplant recipient age. Better survival predictions could eventually lead to more efficient allocation of kidneys and improve patient outcomes."

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are elements which are key to improving crop productivity and soil quality. It is pertinent to understand how agricultural management in the tropics affects the AMF spatio-temporal community composition, especially in crops of global importance, such as coffee (Coffea arabica L.). Soil and root samples were collected from three localities under three management systems (agroecological, conventional and forest fragment), during the phenological stages of coffee (flowering, grain filling, harvesting). Spores were extracted for morphological identification and molecular community analysis by PCR–DGGE. Dendrograms were prepared and the bands were sequenced and analyzed by bioinformatics. No differences were observed in the richness of morphospecies between management systems, localities and period, but little is known about tropical species. Molecular analysis showed that the agroecological management system was similar to natural forest and with a higher diversity indices than conventional management. Locality and period of sample affect AMF community composition. It is necessary to associate classical taxonomic evaluations with molecular biological techniques because different approaches can lead to different outcomes. This study contributes to the understanding of the impact of agriculture management systems on AMF and provides evidence that agroecology is a management system applicable to sustainable coffee production."

However, the molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogen–induced EC barrier disruption are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the role of microtubules (MT) in the mechanisms of EC barrier compromise caused by heat-killed S. aureus (HKSA). Using a customized monolayer permeability assay in human pulmonary EC and MT fractionation, we observed that HKSA-induced barrier disruption is accompanied by MT destabilization and increased histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) activity resulting from elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Molecular or pharmacological HDAC6 inhibition rescued barrier function in HKSA-challenged vascular endothelium. The HKSA-induced EC permeability was associated with impaired MT-mediated delivery of cytoplasmic linker–associated protein 2 (CLASP2) to the cell periphery, limiting its interaction with adherens junction proteins. HKSA-induced EC barrier dysfunction was also associated with increased Rho GTPase activity via activation of MT-bound Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor-H1 (GEF-H1) and was abolished by HDAC6 down-regulation. HKSA activated the NF-κB proinflammatory pathway and increased the expression of intercellular and vascular cell adhesion molecules in EC, an effect that was also HDAC6-dependent and mediated, at least in part, by a GEF-H1/Rho-dependent mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2910520458,"Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium that can cause both superficial and deep-seated infections. Histones released by neutrophils kill bacteria by binding to the bacterial cell surface and causing membrane damage. We postulated that cell wall–anchored proteins protect S. aureus from the bactericidal effects of histones by binding to and sequestering histones away from the cell envelope. Here, we focused on S. aureus strain LAC and by using an array of biochemical assays, including surface plasmon resonance and ELISA, discovered that fibronectin-binding protein B (FnBPB) is the main histone receptor. FnBPB bound all types of histones, but histone H3 displayed the highest affinity and bactericidal activity and was therefore investigated further. H3 bound specifically to the A domain of recombinant FnBPB with a KD of 86 nm, ~20-fold lower than that for fibrinogen. Binding apparently occurred by the same mechanism by which FnBPB binds to fibrinogen, because FnBPB variants defective in fibrinogen binding also did not bind H3. An FnBPB-deletion mutant of S. aureus LAC bound less H3 and was more susceptible to its bactericidal activity and to neutrophil extracellular traps, whereas an FnBPB-overexpressing mutant bound more H3 and was more resistant than the WT. FnBPB bound simultaneously to H3 and plasminogen, which after activation by tissue plasminogen activator cleaved the bound histone. We conclude that FnBPB provides a dual immune-evasion function that captures histones and prevents them from reaching the bacterial membrane and simultaneously binds plasminogen, thereby promoting its conversion to plasmin to destroy the bound histone.

In eukaryotes, DNA is wrapped around a core complex of the histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 to form the nucleosome. Histones are the most abundant proteins in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are released by neutrophils as part of the innate defenses against infecting bacteria (26Sollberger G. Tilley D.O. Zychlinsky A. Neutrophil extracellular traps: the biology of chromatin externalization.Dev.

In addition to histones, NETs contain nuclear DNA and proteases (e.g. elastase). Histones are also released into the bloodstream during severe sepsis (27Xu J. Zhang X. Pelayo R. Monestier M.

The potent antimicrobial activity of histones is due to characteristics akin to cationic antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidins. Besides NETs, other myeloid cell lineages such as basophils (28Schorn C. Janko C. Latzko M. Chaurio R. Schett G. Herrmann M.

Histones are classified as lysine-rich (H1, H2A, and H2B) and arginine-rich (H3 and H4) (32DeLange R.J. Smith E.L. Histones: structure and function.Annu. Rev.

In the Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri, the polysaccharide O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane can contribute to resistance to histones (36Chaput C.

In this study, we have investigated the molecular basis of resistance to histones in S. aureus and found that FnBPB is the major surface component responsible. We studied the mechanism of histone binding by FnBPB and identified the most potent anti-staphylococcal histone as H3. S. aureus is known to bind to histones, but the bacterial components responsible have not been characterized. To determine whether CWA proteins contribute to histone binding, the USA 300 strain LAC (8Diep B.A. Gill S.R. Chang R.F. Phan T.H. Chen J.H. Davidson M.G. Lin F. Lin J. Carleton H.A. Mongodin E.F.

Liu G. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Staphylococcus aureus sortase, an enzyme that anchors surface proteins to the cell wall.Science. 1999; 285 (10427003): 760-76310.1126/science.285.5428.760Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) lacking CWA proteins were tested for their ability to adhere to a surface-coated with pooled calf thymus histones (CTH). WT LAC adhered about three times more strongly than the srtA mutant, which suggests that one or more CWA proteins are dominant histone binders (Fig. 1). The residual binding by the srtA mutant could be due to other surface components such as lipoteichoic acid (33Morita S. Tagai C. Shiraishi T. Miyaji K. Iwamuro S. Differential mode of antimicrobial actions of arginine-rich and lysine-rich histones against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus.Peptides. 2013; 48 (23932939): 75-8210.1016/j.peptides.2013.07.025Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 37Rose-Martel M.

Purified recombinant ligand-binding domains of several CWA proteins were tested for binding to immobilized CTH in an ELISA-type assay. In particular, subdomains N2–N3 of isoform I of FnBPB, comprising residues 163–480 (FnBPB(163–480)), bound strongly to the histone mixture, whereas the N-terminal ligand-binding domains of isoform I of FnBPA, clumping factors A and B, the collagen-binding protein CNA, and also Bbp and Pls, did not bind detectably (Fig. 2A). Control experiments showed that the anti-His tag antibody used in these ELISA experiments recognize all recombinant proteins similarly. The specificity of FnBPB binding to histones was confirmed by performing dose-response binding assays with immobilized CTH. FnBPB(163–480) bound dose-dependently and saturably, whereas no binding of FnBPA(194–511) was observed (Fig. 2B). The ability of recombinant FnBPB(163–480) to bind to individual histones was next measured by ELISA and far-Western blotting. FnBPB(163–480) bound H1 and H3 the strongest (Fig. 3, A and B). It was decided to focus on binding to H3 rather than H1 because the former exhibited stronger anti-bacterial activity (see below). The A domain of FnBPB binds to FBG by the dock, lock, and latch (DLL) mechanism (16Burke F.M. Di Poto A. Speziale P. Foster T.J. The A domain of fibronectin-binding protein B of Staphylococcus aureus contains a novel fibronectin binding site.FEBS J. 2011; 278 (21569203): 2359-237110.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08159.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To investigate whether DLL is involved in histone binding, variants of the recombinant A domain lacking the ability to bind FBG were tested for histone binding. A truncate lacking the 17 residues involved in the locking and latching steps of DLL(464–480) and a mutant with substitutions of Asn-312 and Phe-314 located in the peptide binding trench, neither of which bound FBG, were also defective in binding to histone H3. Furthermore, neither single recombinant subdomains N2(163–308) nor N3(309–480) bound FBG or histone H3 (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that histones could bind FnBPB by the DLL mechanism. To determine whether FnBPB(163–480) forms a complex with H3 in solution, equimolar amounts of the two proteins were mixed and subjected to gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. 4). The two proteins alone eluted with distribution constants (Kav) corresponding to their molecular masses, i.e. ~15 kDa for H3 and 35 kDa for FnBPB(163–480) (Fig. 4, inset), whereas co-incubation of the two proteins yielded a fast running peak of ~50 kDa, in agreement with the predicted molecular mass of FnBPB(163–480)/H3 complex. In contrast, the nonhistone-binding trench mutant failed to form the 50-kDa complex. This shows that FnBPB(163–480) can form a stable complex with H3 in solution and that residues in the FBG-binding trench are crucially important. The affinity of FnBPB for human H3 was measured by surface plasmon resonance. Recombinant FnBPB(163–480) was passed over human H3 immobilized on the surface of a dextran chip in concentrations ranging from 3.9 to 500 nm. The equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, for the interaction was estimated as 86.0 ± 12.5 nm, an affinity that is ~20-fold higher than that reported for the interaction between FnBPB and FBG (Fig. 5A) (20Burke F.M. McCormack N. Rindi S. Speziale P. Foster T.J. Fibronectin-binding protein B variation in Staphylococcus aureus.BMC Microbiol. 2010; 10 (20515471): 16010.1186/1471-2180-10-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). No signal was detected when the FnBPB(163–480) trench mutant was analyzed (Fig. 5B). These data show that FnBPB(163–480) has a high affinity for H3 in solution and that the interaction most likely occurs by the DLL mechanism. The FnBPB(163–480) protein has a hypothetical pI of 5.62 indicating that the protein is anionic at physiological pH, whereas H3 is highly positive (pI 12.5). To further investigate the nature of interaction of H3 with FnBPB(163–480), surface-coated H3 was incubated with FnBPB(163–480) in the presence of increasing amounts of NaCl. At a NaCl concentration of 500 mm, binding of FnBPB(163–480) was reduced by more than 80%. No FnBPB(163–480) binding was observed at higher NaCl concentrations, suggesting that hydrophobic forces are not involved in the interaction and that FnBPB(163–480) binding to H3 is an ionic strength-dependent process (Fig. 5C). There are seven isoforms of FnBPB with amino acid sequence identities ranging from 61 to 85% (20Burke F.M. McCormack N. Rindi S. Speziale P. Foster T.J. Fibronectin-binding protein B variation in Staphylococcus aureus.BMC Microbiol. 2010; 10 (20515471): 16010.1186/1471-2180-10-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Each of the isoforms bind FBG, fibronectin, elastin, and PLG. To determine whether all isoforms bind H3, increasing concentrations of the recombinant N2–N3 subdomains were tested for their ability to bind surface-coated H3 in an ELISA-type assay (Fig. 6). Isoforms II, III, and VI bound similarly to isoform I with dissociation constants in the range of 50–185 nm, whereas the isoforms IV, V, and VII showed a lower binding affinity, with apparent KD values ranging from 270 to 830 nm (Fig. 6A, inset).

Some data suggest strong connections between depression and obesity and more particularly associated prevalence of both disorders. However, little is known about the geographical distribution of these two diseases. This study aimed to determine if there is spatial overlap between obesity and depression using data from the entire French territory. Methods Data for 5,627 geographic codes for metropolitan France were collected from the two national hospital databases (PMSI-MCO and RIM-P) for the year 2016. We identified people who were depressed, obese or both registered in the two public medico-administrative databases, and we assessed their location. In addition, a multivariable analysis was performed in order to determine geographic interactions between obesity and depression after controlling for age, sex, environmental and socio-economic factors (social/material deprivation, urbanicity/rurality). Results 1,045,682 people aged 18 years and older were identified. The mapping analysis showed several cold and hot regional clusters of coinciding obesity and depression. The multivariable analysis demonstrated significant geographic interactions, with an increasing probability of finding a high prevalence of obesity in regions with major depression (OR 1.29 95% CI 1.13–1.49, p = 0.0002) and an increased probability of finding a high prevalence of depression in regions with a high ration of obesity (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.15–1.52, p<0.0001). Conclusion Our study confirms the significant bidirectional relationships between obesity and depression at a group level. French geographic patterns reveal a partial overlap between obesity and depression, suggesting these two diseases can be included in a common approach. Further studies should be done to increase the understanding of this complex comorbidity."

We present evidence that the flexible hinge Gly86 connecting the semiglobules formed by the two pairs of EF-hands reduces GCAP1 affinity for RetGC1 but also adjusts the Ca2+ sensitivity of the activator-to-inhibitor transition to the proper physiological range of RetGC1 regulation by Ca2+.

The patient evaluated at 62 years of age had no history of visual problems (other than myopia) until his 5th decade of life. He was then diagnosed as having a macular dystrophy. Best corrected visual acuities at age 56 were 20/60 and 20/200. Reading and distance vision decreased progressively over many years; and color discrimination became difficult. There was no photosensitivity and no peripheral field or night vision complaints. The patient did not report any general health issues and he was not taking medication with known retinotoxic effects. Visual acuities of the proband were 20/200 (with no significant refractive error) in both eyes. The clinical examination was within normal limits except for the retina. Maculae were granular and thinned in appearance. Peripheral retina, optic nerve, and vessel caliber were normal. Macular functional abnormalities were supported by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) disease apparent on en face imaging (Results and Fig. S1) and retinal structural changes on cross-sectional imaging. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Fig. 1A) showed loss of central retinal lamination suggesting complete degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors. By 10° from the fovea, however, outer nuclear layer (ONL, where rod and cone photoreceptor nuclei are located, highlighted blue) thickness returned to normal. Beyond the perifoveal region, there was a mild thinning of both cone and rod outer segments extending across the width of the scan (Fig. 1, right panels). Illustrating these photoreceptor abnormalities are magnified images (lower panels). Shortened outer segments where phototransduction occurs is likely one of the contributors to the loss of visual function. Electrophysiological (Fig. 1B) and perceptual (45Jacobson S.G. Voigt W.J.

The family history of the proband (Fig. 1C, III, 2) indicated 6 other members with visual symptoms, suggesting an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, although there was no male-to-male transmission. DNA samples from the proband and two other affected family members (III, 3; and IV, 1) were studied. In the proband, a panel of genes associated with inherited retinal degenerations was screened using next-generation sequencing followed by confirmatory Sanger sequencing. A novel heterozygous missense variant, c.256G → C, in the GUCA1A gene was identified in the proband and in other affected family members by direct testing in the GUCA1A gene. In the disease-causing variant, Gly86, residue that connects the exiting helix of EF-hand 2 and the entering helix of EF-hand 3, thus creating a hinge between the semiglobules of GCAP1 formed by two pairs of EF-hand domains (Fig. 2), was substituted by Arg. G86R GCAP1 effectively activated human RetGC1 expressed in HEK293 cells at low free Ca2+ concentrations, similarly to the WT GCAP1 (Fig. 3, A and B), but failed to effectively decelerate the cyclase when free Ca2+ concentrations rise. The [Ca]1/2 values became shifted to 5-fold higher free Ca2+ in both bovine and human orthologs of GCAP1. In the case of human GCAP1, the [Ca]1/2 (mean ± S.D.) for G86R increased to 0.94 ± 0.09 μm (n = 4) from 0.14 ± 0.06 μm (n = 3) in WT (p = 0.0004, unpaired/unequal variance Student's t test). As a result, the RetGC1 remained stimulated by the G86R GCAP1 at free Ca2+ concentrations that by far exceeded those found in dark-adapted mammalian photoreceptors (17Woodruff M.L. Olshevskaya E.V.

However, to be considered for use in human medicine, it is necessary to control and know the chemical composition of the compound, which is not always the case for polymeric chitosans. Here, we analyze the antifungal activity of a soluble and well-defined chito-oligosaccharide (CHOS) with an average polymerization degree (DPn) of 32 and fraction of acetylation (FA) of 0.15 (C32) on 52 medically relevant yeast strains. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) varied widely among yeast species, strains and isolates (from > 5000 to < 9.77 μg mL-1) and inhibition patterns showed a time- and dose-dependencies. The antifungal activity was predominantly fungicidal and was inversely proportional to the pH, being maximal at pH 4.5, the lowest tested pH. Furthermore, antifungal effects of CHOS fractions with varying average molecular weight indicated that those fractions with an intermediate degree of polymerization, i.e. DP 31 and 54, had the strongest inhibitory effects. Confocal imaging showed that C32 adsorbs to the cell surface, with subsequent cell disruption and accumulation of C32 in the cytoplasm. Thus, C32 has potential to be used as a therapy for fungal infections."
https://openalex.org/W2910891617,"One role of Marine Protected Areas is to protect biodiversity; however, illegal fishing activity can reduce the effectiveness of protection. Quantifying illegal fishing effort within no-take MPAs is difficult and the impacts of illegal fishing on biodiversity are poorly understood. To provide an assessment of illegal fishing activity, a surveillance camera was deployed at the Seal Rocks no-take area within the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park from April 2017-March 2018. To assess impacts of illegal fishing activity in the no-take area, Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVs) were used to quantify abundance and size of snapper Chrysophrys auratus from 2011-2017. BRUVs were also deployed at two nearby fished locations and two other no-take areas to allow comparison. Over 12 months of camera surveillance, a total of 108 recreational vessels were observed illegally fishing within the no-take area (avg 9.0 ± 0.9 per month). The greatest number of vessels detected in a single month was 14 and the longest a vessel was observed fishing was ~ 6 hours. From 2011-2017, the abundance of C. auratus within the Seal Rocks no-take area significantly declined by 55%, whilst the abundance within the other fished areas and no-take areas did not significantly decline over the same period. Lengths of C. auratus in the Seal Rocks no-take area were significantly smaller in 2017 compared to 2013 which was driven by a decline in the number of legal sized fish over 30 cm. Based on mean number of illegal fishers per vessel recorded in the no-take area, and an allowable bag limit of 10 C. auratus per person, it is possible that more than 2,000 C. auratus are removed annually from this no-take area. There is a strong likelihood that illegal recreational fishing is causing a reduction on a fishery targeted species within a no-take MPA and measures need to be implemented to reduce the ongoing illegal fishing pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2910336578,"The level of microRNA (miR)-431 was found to be markedly up-regulated in intestinal tissue of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). The objective of this study was to identify the target gene of miR-431 and to investigate the role of the miR-431-FOXA1 axis in the pathophysiology of NEC. The target gene of miR-431 was identified by in silico target prediction bioinformatics, luciferase assay, and Western blotting. Effects of miR-431 on downstream expression signals, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were investigated by overexpression in Caco-2 cells upon stimulation by LPS or lipoteichoic acid (LTA). FOXA1 was identified as the target gene of miR-431. Overexpression of miR-431 in Caco-2 cells significantly inhibited FOXA1, ESRRG, and HNF4A and activated IL-6, LGR5, NFKB2, PLA2G2A, PRKCZ, and TNF. IL-8 and -10 were enhanced when costimulated with LPS or LTA. These potential downstream genes were also significantly dysregulated in primary NEC tissues compared with surgical-control tissues. Overexpression of miR-431 significantly decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of Caco-2 cells. A proposed network of miR-431-FOXA1 interaction with LPS and LTA receptors demonstrates dysregulation of transcription factors, inflammatory mediators, epithelium tight junction regulators, and cell proliferation and apoptosis signals. The miR-431-FOXA1 axis could in part be responsible for the intensification of the inflammatory response in NEC tissues and contribute to the proinflammatory pathophysiology.—Wu, Y. Z., Chan, K. Y.

https://openalex.org/W2910281883,"Distal radius fractures are very common yet controversy exists regarding which require treatment and is reflected by significant variation in surgical intervention rate. Evidence regarding which fractures would benefit from intervention is varied and largely poor quality. This study had three aims; identify which radiographic parameters are clinically important; quantify the threshold of displacement at which intervention should occur and investigate which patient factors influence the decision to intervene. A modified three round Delphi study was carried out and responses were qualitatively analysed. The Delphi panel was composed of three groups of national and international expert surgeons: hand and wrist surgeons, trauma surgeons, and international researchers. 46 participants initially agreed to take part. 43 completed the first round and all then completed three rounds. Participants were asked questions based around case vignettes in patients of three ages (38, 58, 75 years). For all age groups ulnar variance was ranked as the most important extra-articular parameter, step was ranked as the most important intra-articular parameter. Agreed thresholds were the same for all parameters for patients aged 38 and 58. Surgeons would intervene with +2 mm ulnar variance, 10 degrees dorsal tilt, 2mm step and 3mm gap. In patients aged 75 the agreed thresholds were 20 degrees dorsal tilt, 3mm step and 4mm gap, consensus was not achieved for ulnar variance. Mental capacity, pre-injury functional level and medical co-morbidities were ranked as the most important factors influencing the decision to intervene. Qualitative analysis suggested that pre-injury function was the main theme within these factors. Our findings provide useful advice about which parameters should be measured and radiographic thresholds for intervention. These thresholds may then be modified depending on important patient factors. This information can help guide clinicians with management decisions and reduce variation."
https://openalex.org/W2891730570,"Rapid, accurate prediction of protein structure from amino acid sequence would accelerate fields as diverse as drug discovery, synthetic biology and disease diagnosis. Massively improved prediction of protein structures has been driven by improving the prediction of the amino acid residues that contact in their 3D structure. For an average globular protein, around 92% of all residue pairs are non-contacting, therefore accurate prediction of only a small percentage of inter-amino acid distances could increase the number of constraints to guide structure determination. We have trained deep neural networks to predict inter-residue contacts and distances. Distances are predicted with an accuracy better than most contact prediction techniques. Addition of distance constraints improved de novo structure predictions for test sets of 158 protein structures, as compared to using the best contact prediction methods alone. Importantly, usage of distance predictions allows the selection of better models from the structure pool without a need for an external model assessment tool. The results also indicate how the accuracy of distance prediction methods might be improved further."

In contrast to these light-activated proteins that are able to increase cAMP and cGMP concentrations, an efficient native light-dependent enzyme capable of lowering the concentration of cyclic nucleotides was unknown until recently. In 2017, we reported a novel type of microbial rhodopsin with a C-terminal PDE domain (15Yoshida K. Tsunoda S.P. Brown L.S. Kandori H. A unique choanoflagellate enzyme rhodopsin exhibits light-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity.J. Biol.

This protein, Rh-PDE, was found in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta, a unicellular and colonial single flagellate eukaryote that is considered to be one of the closest living relatives of metazoans. We successfully expressed and purified the full-length Rh-PDE from mammalian cells, and its enzymatic functions were studied in cells, membranes, and detergent, both biochemically and spectroscopically. Rh-PDE exhibits light-dependent hydrolysis activity toward both cGMP and cAMP, which is an unusual promiscuity, as normally the binding sites are very specific for one or the other cyclic nucleotide. A putative molecular mechanism to explain Rh-PDE activation was proposed based on a series of studies that examined the full-length protein. Two recent papers revealed that Rh-PDE possesses eight transmembrane helices, not seven, such that both the N and C terminus face the cytoplasmic side (16Lamarche L.B. Kumar R.P. Trieu M.M.

The light-induced mechanism of activation of Rh-PDE enzymatic activity is particularly intriguing, and to assess it, in vivo and in vitro studies have been extensively initiated. On the other hand, detailed structural and mechanistic studies require large amounts of purified sample, which is not easy for full-length proteins, in this case Rh-PDE(full). In this study, to gain structural and mechanistic information about the Rh domain, we expressed and purified the transmembrane domain of Rh-PDE and Rh-PDE(TMD) and applied various spectroscopic methods such as transient absorption, UV-visible, and FTIR spectroscopy. We observed the K and M intermediates during the Rh-PDE(TMD) photocycle, and light-induced difference FTIR spectroscopy provided information on the structural dynamics of Rh-PDE(TMD). Phylogenetic analysis showed that Rh-PDE is homologous to other enzyme rhodopsins and channelrhodopsins such as cation channelrhodopsin 2 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrCCR2) (Fig. S1; sequential comparison with other microbial rhodopsins is shown in Fig. S2). In fact, the observed structural dynamics of Rh-PDE(TMD) resemble those of CrCCR2 and a chimera of CrCCR1 and CrCCR2, CrCCR(C1C2). On the other hand, CCR opens the channel, whereas Rh-PDE activates the enzymatic PDE domain. The mechanism of Rh-PDE activation will be discussed based on the present spectroscopic observations. Fig. S3 shows the absorption spectrum of a purified sample of Rh-PDE(TMD) at pH 8.0. The λmax is located at 497 nm, which is 5-nm red-shifted from that reported previously for Rh-PDE(full) at pH 6.5 (15Yoshida K. Tsunoda S.P. Brown L.S. Kandori H.

We first examined the photoreaction dynamics of Rh-PDE(TMD) by using flash photolysis with nanosecond laser excitation. In the first paper (15Yoshida K. Tsunoda S.P. Brown L.S. Kandori H. A unique choanoflagellate enzyme rhodopsin exhibits light-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity.J. Biol.

Tsunoda S.P. Brown L.S. Kandori H. A unique choanoflagellate enzyme rhodopsin exhibits light-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity.J. Biol.

From the linear temperature dependence of the logarithm of the rate constant (ln k) between 4 and 24 °C, the time constant of the M decay (τ1/e) was estimated to be 6.8 s at 27 °C, which was the temperature of the GloSensor assay. With a higher time resolution, we expected to obtain the time constant of the rise in M as well as the origin of its precursor. Fig. 1A shows the appearance of transient absorption at 600 nm within 5 μs (time resolution), which corresponds to the red-shifted K-like intermediate. The K-like intermediate decayed with a time constant of 4.0 ms. Fig. 1B monitors the transient absorption at 400 nm for the blue-shifted M intermediate, which formed with a time constant of 2.2 ms (24%) and 4.6 ms (76%), and decayed with a time constant of 2.2 s (48%) and 5.4 s (52%). Fig. 1C monitors the transient absorption at 500 nm, corresponding to the bleaching signal of Rh-PDE(TMD), and the kinetics represent a mirror image of the kinetics at 400 nm. In fact, transient absorption at 500 nm decreased with a time constant of 0.6 ms (17%) and 4.0 ms (83%) and increased with a time constant of 3.7 s, which coincided well with the M formation and decay, respectively. Thus, the present transient absorption study revealed that the K-like intermediate converted into the M intermediate with a time constant of 4 ms and that the M intermediate returned to its original state with a time constant of 4 s. Fig. 1A clearly shows the lack of an O intermediate at a late stage of the photocycle. Recovery of the Rh-PDE(TMD) photocycle (4 s) is close to that of Rh-PDE(full) (7 s) (15Yoshida K. Tsunoda S.P.

Chem. 2017; 292 (28302718): 7531-754110.1074/jbc.M117.775569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicating little influence of the PDE domain on the photocycle of the Rh domain. As the enzymatic activity remained in a minute time scale, any delay of structural changes to the PDE domain takes place independently in Rh-PDE(full). To gain structural insight into the K and M intermediates, we applied light-induced difference FTIR spectroscopy. Prior to the analysis, we first examined the experimental conditions by light-induced difference UV-visible spectroscopy. Transient absorption was measured for the Rh-PDE(TMD) sample solubilized in 0.03% DDM, whereas FTIR spectroscopy was applied to the hydrated film sample reconstituted into membranes. In this study, the purified Rh-PDE(TMD) sample was reconstituted into POPE/POPG (3:1) liposomes, and the dry film was hydrated by placing a drop of water next to the film. The black curve in Fig. 2A shows the difference spectra of Rh-PDE(TMD) after-minus-before illumination at 480 nm and at 77 K. The negative and positive peaks at 460/490 and 550 nm correspond to Rh-PDE(TMD) and the red-shifted K intermediate, respectively. Illumination at >570 nm yielded a mirror-image difference spectrum (red curve in Fig. 2A), indicating that the K intermediate had reverted into the original state. The black curve in Fig. 2B, which shows the difference spectrum of Rh-PDE(TMD) after-minus-before illumination at >500 nm and at 295 K, exhibits positive and negative peaks at 406 and 505 nm, respectively. Therefore, the photoproduct is the M intermediate under the present conditions. It should be noted that the difference spectra in Fig. 2B are considerably red-shifted from those reported previously. In the previous study (15Yoshida K. Tsunoda S.P. Brown L.S. Kandori H. A unique choanoflagellate enzyme rhodopsin exhibits light-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28302718): 7531-754110.1074/jbc.M117.775569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), Rh-PDE(full) was solubilized in detergent (0.02% DDM), and these differences in sample conditions presumably affect absorption. Fig. 3 (A and B) shows the light-induced difference FTIR spectra of Rh-PDE(TMD) in the 1800–900 cm−1 region, which were measured at 77 and 295 K, after hydration with H2O (black lines) and D2O (red lines), respectively. These spectra correspond to the K and M intermediates based on UV-visible absorption. In Fig. 3A, the strongest negative and positive peaks appear at 1553 and 1538 cm−1, respectively, in H2O. The strongest peaks were observed at 1553 and 1536 cm−1 in D2O, which are assignable to the C=C stretching vibrations of the retinal chromophore. The lower frequency shift corresponds to the spectral red shift. Near the positive 1538 cm−1 peak, an additional positive peak was observed at 1527 cm−1, which was shifted to a lower frequency in D2O. There was no positive peak at this frequency region in Fig. 3B, consistent with the formation of the M intermediate in which the Schiff base was deprotonated. In the 1250–1150 cm−1 region, which is the frequency region of the C–C stretch, five negative bands were observed at 1241, 1235, 1210, 1199, and 1183 cm−1, whereas only a sharp positive band was observed at 1191 cm−1. In general, the C–C stretch of the retinal chromophore is insensitive to H/D exchange, and thus only such peaks correspond to the bands at 1241 (−), 1199 (−), and 1191 (+) cm−1. Therefore, these bands are likely to originate from the C–C stretching vibrations of the retinal chromophore. It is important to note that the positive 1191 cm−1 band represents a characteristic frequency of 13-cis-retinal, owing to the C14–C15 stretching vibration (18Mizuide N. Shibata M. Friedman N. Sheves M. Belenky M. Herzfeld J. Kandori H. Structural changes in bacteriorhodopsin following retinal photoisomerization from the 13-cis form.Biochemistry. 2006; 45 (16939219): 10674-1068110.1021/bi060958sCrossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This indicates that the K intermediate contains 13-cis chromophore and that the primary photoreaction is the all-trans to 13-cis isomerization of retinal, as well as other microbial rhodopsins (1Ernst O.P. Lodowski D.T. Elstner M. Hegemann P. Brown L.S. Kandori H. Microbial and animal rhodopsins: structures, functions, and molecular mechanisms.Chem. Rev. 2014; 114 (24364740): 126-16310.1021/cr4003769Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). No positive peak at this frequency region in Fig. 3B is consistent with formation of the M intermediate. Hydrogen-out-of-plane (HOOP) vibrations generally appear at 1000–900 cm−1, and the presence of strong HOOP modes represents a distortion of the retinal molecule at the corresponding position. Strong HOOP vibrations are characteristic of the primary K intermediate, and the HOOP modes near the Schiff base are sensitive to H/D exchange. In the case of Rh-PDE(TMD), there were two peaks at 1002 and 957 cm−1, which were insensitive to H/D exchange. The band at 1002 cm−1 is very high, as much as the HOOP vibration, and the frequency is characteristic of C9 and C13 methyl-rock vibrations, as was seen for a light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (BR) (negative 1009 cm−1 band) and a photochromic sensor Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (ASR) (negative 1006 cm−1 band) (Fig. S4) (19Furutani Y. Kawanabe A. Jung K.-H. Kandori H. FTIR spectroscopy of the all-trans form of Anabaena sensory rhodopsin at 77 K: hydrogen bond of a water between the Schiff base and Asp75.Biochemistry. 2005; 44 (16156642): 12287-1229610.1021/bi050841oCrossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 1002 cm−1 band originates from a methyl-rock vibration or a HOOP vibration at the middle of the polyene chain of retinal chromophore. A positive peak was observed at 968 cm−1 in D2O, but the corresponding peak in H2O was unclear. A positive band at 1027 cm−1 in H2O shifted to 1019 cm−1 in D2O, but it was too high to assign HOOP vibrations. Fig. S4 clearly shows H/D-exchangeable HOOP vibrations at 1000–900 cm−1 for CrCCR(C1C2), BR, and ASR, which reflect a chromophore distortion near the Schiff base. However, Rh-PDE(TMD) did not exhibit HOOP bands, such as N–H or C15–H, in the K intermediate. Thus, Rh-PDE(TMD) lacks chromophore distortion near the Schiff base. Instead, the distortion is located at the middle of the chromophore. No positive peak at this frequency region in Fig. 3B is consistent with formation of the M intermediate, where the Schiff base is deprotonated. The negative band at 1666 cm−1 in H2O appears to have shifted to 1638 cm−1 in D2O (Fig. 3A) and thus originates from the C=N stretching vibrations of the protonated Schiff base. The upshift in frequency of the C=N stretching vibration in H2O is caused by its coupling to the N-H bending vibration of the Schiff base, and the difference in frequency between H2O and D2O is regarded as a measure of the hydrogen-bonding strength of the Schiff base. Such a difference for Rh-PDE(TMD) (28 cm−1) is much larger than that of BR (13 cm−1), suggesting that the hydrogen bond of the Schiff base in Rh-PDE is stronger than in BR. It should be noted, however, that the negative peak at 1666 cm−1 is not necessarily accurate because there is a sharp positive peak at about 1660 cm−1 in D2O (Fig. 3A) that influences the negative peak at 1666 cm−1. In fact, Fig. 3B shows that a strong negative peak at 1658 cm−1 reduces the half-intensity in D2O. Therefore, the C=NH stretch of Rh-PDE(TMD) is probably located at 1658 cm−1. In Fig. 3B, the C=ND stretch at 1638 cm−1 in D2O is canceled by the positive peak at 1633 cm−1 in D2O. In contrast to the negative band, the C=N stretch of the positive band (K intermediate) is complicated, as shown in Fig. 3A. There are two peaks at 1628 and 1618 cm−1 in H2O and three peaks at ~1625, 1605, and 1589 cm−1 in D2O, and it is not easy to identify the C=N stretch. The C=N stretch is H/D-insensitive for the M intermediate, whereas the corresponding positive peak is unclear in Fig. 3B. Fig. 4, which monitors X–D stretching vibrations, shows the difference spectra at 2800–1800 cm−1 in D2O. We compared the difference spectra of Rh-PDE(TMD) (A) with those of CrCCR(C1C2) (B) (20Ito S.

Structural changes of water in the Schiff base region of bacteriorhodopsin: proposal of a hydration switch model.Biochemistry. 2003; 42 (12600197): 2300-230610.1021/bi026990dCrossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and ASR (D) (19Furutani Y. Kawanabe A. Jung K.-H. Kandori H. FTIR spectroscopy of the all-trans form of Anabaena sensory rhodopsin at 77 K: hydrogen bond of a water between the Schiff base and Asp75.Biochemistry. 2005; 44 (16156642): 12287-1229610.1021/bi050841oCrossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A spectral comparison of the samples hydrated with D2O and D218O identified O–D stretching vibrations of water molecules that changed their frequencies upon retinal photoisomerization, which were tagged by green numbers. Fig. 4A shows that almost all bands at >2400 cm−1 shifted to lower frequencies in 18O water. In contrast, no bands shifted at <2400 cm−1, indicating that these bands originate from N–D or nonwater O–D stretching vibrations. The N–D stretching vibration of the protonated Schiff base appears in this frequency region, and a previous [ζ-15N]lysine labeling study identified the 2171/2123 and 2466 cm−1 bands as the N–D stretches of BR and BRK (Fig. 4C) (22Kandori H. Belenky M. Herzfeld J. Vibrational frequency and dipolar orientation of the protonated Schiff base in bacteriorhodopsin before and after photoisomerization.Biochemistry. 2002; 41 (11993997): 6026-603110.1021/bi025585jCrossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and the 2163/2125 and 2470 cm−1 bands as the N–D stretches of ASR and ASRK (Fig. 4D) (23Kawanabe A. Furutani Y. Jung K.H. Kandori H. FTIR study of the photoisomerization processes in the 13-cis and all-trans forms of Anabaena sensory rhodopsin at 77 K.Biochemistry. 2006; 45 (16584171): 4362-437010.1021/bi052324bCrossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), respectively. We inferred the 2022 cm−1 band as the N–D stretch of CrCCR(C1C2) (Fig. 4B) (20Ito S. Kato H.E. Taniguchi R. Iwata T. Nureki O. Kandori H. Water-containing hydrogen-bonding network in the active center of channelrhodopsin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136 (24512107): 3475-348210.1021/ja410836gCrossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), although this was not identified by any isotope. In the case of Rh-PDE(TMD), a broad negative spectral feature at 2250–2100 cm−1 is a candidate of the N–D stretch of the Schiff base, and its frequency is consistent with the results of the analysis of the C=N stretch. The Schiff base forms a strong hydrogen bond in Rh-PDE(TMD), which is also the case in CrCCR(C1C2), BR, ASR, and many other rhodopsins. On the other hand, a unique spectral feature in Rh-PDE(TMD) was observed for the K intermediate after retinal photoisomerization. Fig. 4A shows a broad positive band at 2050–1900 cm−1, centered at 1960 cm−1, which does not originate from water vibrations. From a similar broad spectral feature of the bands at 2250–2100 cm−1 (−) and at 2050–1900 cm−1 (+), it is likely that these bands correspond to each other, presumably the N–D stretch of the Schiff base. In this case, a lower frequency shift indicates that the hydrogen bond of the Schiff base becomes stronger in the K intermediate. This is unique because photoisomerization weakens the hydrogen bond of the Schiff base, as can be seen in Fig. 4, C and D. We assigned green-tagged bands in Fig. 4A to the O–D stretching vibrations of water in Rh-PDE(TMD); seven negative bands as the water O–D stretching vibrations of Rh-PDE(TMD) at 2717, 2682, 2672, 2648, 2559, 2494, and 2486 cm−1; and six positive bands as the water O–D stretching vibrations of the K intermediate at 2691, 2636, 2539, 2516, 2503, and 2456 cm−1. The unbalanced number of positive and negative bands suggests that positive peaks contain vibrations of multiple water molecule"

Understanding nitrogen (N) availability in crop residues under various N fertilization regimes is important in optimizing N management. Pot experiments were conducted to investigate the contribution, fate and residual effects of urea and maize residue-N using a 15N isotope technique. Four N regimes were tested: three basal–topdressing ratios of N applied as urea (100–0, 75–25, 50–50) and one basal application of 75% N as urea and 25% N as manure (75U+25M). An average of 31.4% wheat N uptake was derived from urea, 9.2% from maize residue, and 59.5% from the soil in the first season. During the growing stages of wheat, maize residue contributed 0.3–4.8% and 3.1–13.2% to soil mineral and microbial biomass N, respectively, and those originated from urea was 1.0–4.2% and 4.6–16.8%, respectively. Regarding the fate of urea and residue-N after the first season, 35.9% and 16.9% of urea-15N and residue-15N were recovered by wheat, 28.1% and 46.9% remained in the soil, and 36.0% and 36.2% were lost. The contribution of urea to crop N uptake and N recovery efficiency increased, while that of residue-N decreased with increasing proportion of topdressing N. Substituting 25% mineral N with manure decreased the urea-15N loss without negative effects on crop dry matter and N uptake. Residual urea-15N and maize residue-15N from the previous season contributed 3.9% and 3.0% to summer maize N uptake. Additionally, 29.3% of residue-15N remained in the soil after the second season, while only 18.6% of urea-15N remained. Our study suggests that fertilizer and crop residue are actively involved in soil N transformation and plant N nutrition, emphasizing the capacities of organic residues to sustainably supply nutrients. Considering the utilization of both N fertilizer and maize residue, we may suggest a 75–25 split in N fertilizer application, but more appropriate options need to be further assessed under different cropping systems."

Methods We conducted a nationwide population-based study using a National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort of the Korean population, consisting of 1 million individuals who submitted medical care claims between 2002 and 2013. RA was identified using as the International Classification of Diseases code M05 (seropositive RA), with prescription of any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD). Our analysis was based on the data of 1655 patients with incident seropositive RA and 8275 non-RA controls. The controls were matched to the RA cohort by sex, age at the time of diagnosis, duration of follow-up, geographic region, type of social security, and household income. Results The most commonly used conventional synthetic DMARDs were hydroxychloroquine (71.30%) and methotrexate (69.5%), with adalimumab being the most commonly used biologic DMARD (2.54%). The mortality rate was significantly higher in the RA than the control group (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–1.64) in the first 10 years after diagnosis. Specifically, mortality due to infectious diseases (IRR 4.41, 95% CI 1.60–12.17) and pneumonia (IRR 3.92, 95% CI 1.46–10.53) was significantly higher in the RA than control group. The disability rate was higher in the RA than control group over the first 10 years of the disease (IRR 2.27, 95% CI 1.77–2.92), which was attributed to a higher incidence of physical disability (IRR 3.81, 95% CI 2.81–5.15). Annual health expenditure was greater for the RA than the control group. Conclusions Therefore, the rate of mortality and disability, as well as healthcare expenditure, are higher for patients with RA over the first 10 years of the disease onset, than the general population of Korea. The use of claim data has limited the quality of information and there is a limit to the observation period, and we expect the prospective national-wide multicenter cohort for longer period to overcome these limitations."
https://openalex.org/W2909449416,"HER2/ErbB2 activation turns on transcriptional processes that induce local invasion and lead to systemic metastasis. The early transcriptional changes needed for ErbB2-induced invasion are poorly understood. Here, we link ErbB2 activation to invasion via ErbB2-induced, SUMO-directed phosphorylation of a single serine residue, S27, of the transcription factor myeloid zinc finger-1 (MZF1). Utilizing an antibody against MZF1-pS27, we show that the phosphorylation of S27 correlates significantly (p < 0.0001) with high-level expression of ErbB2 in primary invasive breast tumors. Phosphorylation of MZF1-S27 is an early response to ErbB2 activation and results in increased transcriptional activity of MZF1. It is needed for the ErbB2-induced expression of MZF1 target genes CTSB and PRKCA, and invasion of single-cells from ErbB2-expressing breast cancer spheroids. The phosphorylation of MZF1-S27 is preceded by poly-SUMOylation of K23, which can make S27 accessible to efficient phosphorylation by PAK4. Based on our results, we suggest for an activation mechanism where phosphorylation of MZF1-S27 triggers MZF1 dissociation from its transcriptional repressors such as the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Our findings increase understanding of the regulation of invasive signaling in breast cancer by uncovering a detailed biological mechanism of how ErbB2 activation can rapidly lead to its invasion-promoting target gene expression and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2910242420,"We have previously shown that diabetes causes dysfunctional cerebral neovascularization that increases the risk for cerebrovascular disorders such as stroke and cognitive impairment. Pericytes (PCs) play a pivotal role in the angiogenic process through their interaction with the endothelial cells (EC). Yet, the role of PCs in dysfunctional cerebral neovascularization in diabetes is unclear. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the increased proangiogenic Ephrin-B2 signaling in PCs contributes to the dysfunctional cerebral neovascularization in diabetes. Type-II diabetes was induced by a combination of high fat diet and low dose streptozotocin injection in male Wistar rats. Selective in vivo Ephrin-B2 silencing in brain PCs was achieved using the stereotactic injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) with NG2-promoter that expresses Ephrin-B2 shRNA. Neovascularization was assessed using vascular fluorescent dye stain. Novel object recognition (NOR) test was used to determine cognitive functions. Human brain microvascular pericytes HBMVPCs were grown in high glucose 25 mM and palmitate 200 uM (HG/Pal) to mimic diabetic conditions. Scratch migration and tube formation assays were conducted to evaluate PC/EC interaction and angiogenic functions in PC/EC co-culture. Diabetes increased the expression of Ephrin-B2 in the cerebrovasculature and pericytes. Concomitant increases in cerebral neovascularization parameters including vascular density, tortuosity and branching density in diabetic rats were accompanied by deterioration of cognitive function. Inhibition of Ephrin-B2 expression in PCs significantly restored cerebral vascularization and improved cognitive functions. HG/Pal increased PC/EC angiogenic properties in co-culture. Silencing Ephrin-B2 in PCs significantly reduced PC migration and PC/EC co-culture angiogenic properties. This study emphasizes the significant contribution of PCs to the pathological neovascularization in diabetes. Our findings introduce Ephrin-B2 signaling as a promising therapeutic target to improve cerebrovascular integrity in diabetes."

NUAK1/2 belong to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family, whose members control central and protein metabolism, polarity, and overall cellular homeostasis. We found that TGFβ-mediated transcriptional induction of NUAK1 and NUAK2 requires SMAD family members 2, 3, and 4 (SMAD2/3/4) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities, which provided immediate and early signals for the transient expression of these two kinases. Genomic mapping identified an enhancer element within the first intron of the NUAK2 gene that can recruit SMAD proteins, which, when cloned, could confer induction by TGFβ. Furthermore, NUAK2 formed protein complexes with SMAD3 and the TGFβ type I receptor. Functionally, NUAK1 suppressed and NUAK2 induced TGFβ signaling. This was evident during TGFβ-induced epithelial cytostasis, mesenchymal differentiation, and myofibroblast contractility, in which NUAK1 or NUAK2 silencing enhanced or inhibited these responses, respectively.

The novel (nua) kinase (NUAK) subfamily consists of two members, NUAK1 or AMPK-related kinase 5 (ARK5) and NUAK2 or sucrose nonfermenting AMPK-related kinase (SNARK). NUAK2 can be transcriptionally induced by UV light (14Rosen C.F. Poon R. Drucker D.J.

NUAK1 physically interacts with MYPT1 and phosphorylates and inhibits its phosphatase activity, enhancing phosphorylation of MLC2 (23Zagórska A. Deak M. Campbell D.G. Banerjee S. Hirano M. Aizawa S.

Signal. 2010; 3 (20354225): ra25Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). NUAK1 contains a predicted AKT phosphorylation motif, which, when phosphorylated, results in elevated phosphorylation of the ataxia-telangiectasia protein and of p53, promoting survival (24Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Lu J. Ogura T. Lavin M.F. Esumi H. Identification of a novel protein kinase mediating Akt survival signaling to the ATM protein.J. Biol.

Accordingly, NUAK1 suppresses apoptosis induced by nutrient starvation and death receptors in hepatoma cells (24Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Lu J. Ogura T. Lavin M.F. Esumi H.

NUAK1 can also modulate AMPK activity and therefore ATP levels in Myc-driven tumors, by limiting mTOR signaling. NUAK1 depletion released pro-apoptotic signals both in vitro and in vivo in hepatocellular carcinoma (25Liu L. Ulbrich J. Müller J. Wüstefeld T. Aeberhard L. Kress T.R. Muthalagu N. Rycak L.

Furthermore, NUAK1 can activate the polo kinase-1 indirectly, via inhibition of protein phosphatase 1β, thus stimulating cell cycle progression through the S phase (26Banerjee S. Zagórska A. Deak M. Campbell D.G. Prescott A.R. Alessi D.R. Interplay between Polo kinase, LKB1-activated NUAK1 kinase, PP1βMYPT1 phosphatase complex and the SCFβTrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase.Biochem.

Moreover, elevated NUAK1 levels can drive invasion of pancreatic cancer or exert tumor-promoting effects in breast cancer (27Chang X.Z. Yu J. Liu H.Y. Dong R.H. Cao X.C. ARK5 is associated with the invasive and metastatic potential of human breast cancer cells.J. Cancer Res. Clin.

On the other hand, NUAK1 can be anti-tumorigenic, by binding and phosphorylating p53 in a LKB1 activation–dependent manner, by inducing expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and G1/S phase arrest (29Hou X. Liu J.E. Liu W. Liu C.Y. Liu Z.Y. Sun Z.Y. A new role of NUAK1: directly phosphorylating p53 and regulating cell proliferation.Oncogene. 2011; 30 (21317932): 2933-294210.1038/onc.2011.19Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In normal diploid fibroblasts, NUAK1 is induced upon aging, mediating senescence (30Humbert N. Navaratnam N. Augert A. Da Costa M. Martien S. Wang J. Martinez D. Abbadie C. Carling D. de Launoit Y. Gil J. Bernard D. Regulation of ploidy and senescence by the AMPK-related kinase NUAK1.EMBO J. 2010; 29 (19927127): 376-38610.1038/emboj.2009.342Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), further supporting a tumor-suppressing function. The present study ascribes novel functions to NUAK1 and NUAK2. Transcriptional induction of NUAK1 and NUAK2 by TGFβ generates signaling loops in a way that NUAK1 inhibits, whereas NUAK2 promotes, biological responses mediated by TGFβ signaling. By screening for expression of 15 AMPK members and related kinases in human foreskin AG1523 fibroblasts and in mouse mammary epithelial NMuMG cells that respond well to TGFβ, we found that many AMPKs were expressed in both cell types, whereas some kinases were essentially undetectable (Fig. 1 (A and B); data not shown). We asked whether TGFβ could induce expression of these kinases and found that NUAK1, NUAK2, and SIK1 were reproducibly induced by 2-fold or more in the fibroblasts (Fig. 1A); Nuak2 mRNA was induced by about 2-fold in mammary cells (Fig. 1B). TGFβ-dependent inducibility was reproduced in diverse cell types, including mouse C2C12 myoblasts and LKB1 knockout MEFs (data not shown), immortalized human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells and their Ras-transformed derivatives (MCF10A-Ras MII), immortalized human keratinocytes HaCaT, and human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells (Fig. S1). The degree of inducibility of NUAK1 mRNA, however, varied between cell types (Fig. S1A). Protein analysis confirmed that NUAK1 and NUAK2 were induced in a time-dependent manner in human fibroblasts (Fig. 1C), mammary cells (data shown for NUAK2 only; Fig. 1D), and HaCaT and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells (Fig. S1B). Protein specificity was confirmed by predicted electrophoretic mobility, inducibility by TGFβ stimulation, and loss of protein upon transfection of cells with siRNAs (Fig. 1D, Nuak2). After blocking ribosomal function with cycloheximide, TGFβ induced NUAK1 mRNA by about 7-fold in AG1523 cells (Fig. 2A) and Nuak2 mRNA by about 4-fold in the NMuMG cells (Fig. 2B); these were comparable -fold inductions relative to control without cycloheximide (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that TGFβ regulates NUAK1 and Nuak2 expression at the transcriptional level. Translational inhibition resulted in accumulation of NUAK1 and Nuak2 mRNA in the absence of TGFβ (Fig. 2, A and B); NUAK1 or Nuak2 protein levels were markedly increased in the presence of TGFβ but disappeared after cycloheximide treatment, as expected (Fig. 2, A and B). SMAD2 phosphorylation, which verified active TGFβ signaling, was not influenced by cycloheximide, because TβRI phosphorylates a pre-existing pool of SMAD2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Actinomycin D, which inhibits transcription, blocked TGFβ-induced Nuak2 mRNA expression (Fig. 2C), supporting a transcriptional mechanism. Depletion of SMAD4 in AG1523 fibroblasts using transient siRNA transfection, blocked induction of NUAK1 protein by TGFβ (Fig. 2D), suggesting that TGFβ can enhance NUAK1 expression via a SMAD4-dependent pathway. Depleting Smad4 mRNA in NMuMG cells blocked the induction of both Nuak2 and Gadd45γ mRNAs by TGFβ (Fig. 2E); Gadd45γ is a known TGFβ-inducible gene (31Landesman Y. Bringold F. Milne D.D. Meek D.W. Modifications of p53 protein and accumulation of p21 and gadd45 mRNA in TGF-β 1 growth inhibited cells.Cell. Signal. 1997; 9 (9218130): 291-29810.1016/S0898-6568(97)89890-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) used as positive control. In SMAD4-null human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-468 cells, NUAK2 protein expression and weak inducibility by TGFβ were rescued upon reconstitution of SMAD4 in the cells (Fig. 2F). Inhibiting TβRI kinase activity with two independent chemical inhibitors (LY2157299 and SB505124) completely suppressed TGFβ-induced NUAK1 and NUAK2 levels in AG1523 cells (Fig. 2G). On the other hand, inhibiting MAPK ERK1/2 and p38 pathways with the inhibitors Cl-1040 (PD184352, MEK inhibitor) and SB203580, respectively, significantly but not completely blocked the inducibility of Nuak2 by TGFβ in NMuMG cells (Fig. 2H). Thus, TGFβ enhances NUAK1 and NUAK2 expression in a TβRI- and SMAD4-dependent manner, with additional contributions by the MAPKs in the case of NUAK2. Earlier genome-wide ChIP-Seq analysis (32Koinuma D. Tsutsumi S. Kamimura N. Taniguchi H. Miyazawa K. Sunamura M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Aburatani H. Chromatin immunoprecipitation on microarray analysis of Smad2/3 binding sites reveals roles of ETS1 and TFAP2A in transforming growth factor β signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29 (18955504): 172-18610.1128/MCB.01038-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) identified a SMAD2/3-binding region in the first NUAK2 intron in HaCaT keratinocytes, and we could identify the homologous binding region in the mouse Nuak2 gene as well (Fig. 3A). ChIP-qPCR analysis showed that TGFβ stimulation for 1 h potently induced SMAD2/3 binding to the Nuak2 intronic enhancer region (Fig. 4B). SMAD2/3 binding to the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (Pai1) promoter and the hemoglobin B (Hbb) control promoter were included as positive and negative controls of the ChIP assay, respectively (Fig. 3B). We consider the weak TGFβ-induced binding of SMAD2/3 to the Hbb region as background nonspecific binding (Fig. 3B). Inspecting the promoter sequence up to 2 kbp upstream from the transcriptional start site (TSS), we could not identify any specific SMAD2/3 binding using ChIP (data not shown). We therefore cloned the mouse Nuak2 intronic enhancer region into a luciferase construct containing a minimal promoter (Fig. 3C). Sustained TGFβ signaling due to transfection of a constitutively active TβRI (ALK5TD) resulted in an increase of luciferase activity compared with control (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the Nuak2 intronic region has the potential to function as a TGFβ-inducible enhancer. Transfection of the same enhancer construct into NMuMG cells showed that TGFβ signaling enhanced its already high basal activity (Fig. 3E). Cloning of 1- or 2-kbp promoter regions of mouse Nuak2 into luciferase constructs (Fig. 3C) did not yield any positive regulation by TGFβ (Fig. 3E), in agreement with the scan of the promoter region for the SMAD2/3-binding region via ChIP analysis. Thus, TGFβ signaling promotes NUAK2 transcription minimally via a SMAD protein complex that associates with an enhancer in the first NUAK2 intron. Whether a similar enhancer mediates inducibility of NUAK1 to TGFβ remains to be examined.Figure 4NUAK2 physically interacts with SMAD3. A, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged SMAD2 (S2), SMAD3 (S3), or SMAD4 (S4) or the respective empty vector and GST-tagged NUAK2 or GST alone (0.5 μg of DNA/plasmid). After treatment with TGFβ (2.5 ng/ml) for 2.5 h, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) using FLAG-embedded agarose beads for 1 h, and proteins were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The corresponding whole-cell lysates (WCL; 2.5% of input used for immunoprecipitation) were analyzed in parallel. Proteins were detected by using NUAK2, FLAG, and GST antibodies. The immunoglobulin light chain (LC) is also marked. IB, immunoblotting. B, GST-tagged NUAK2 or GST alone was transiently transfected (1 μg of DNA/plasmid) in HEK 293T cells. Following either stimulation of cells with TGFβ (2 ng/ml) for 30 min or TβRI inhibitor GW6604 (3 μm) for 1 h to quench autocrine signaling, cell lysates were incubated overnight with SMAD3 antibody (0.5 μg) or its respective rabbit isotype (0.5 μg) as a negative control, followed by pulldown by protein A Dynabeads for 1 h. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting for SMAD3, NUAK2, and GST. The anti-SMAD3 antibody never pulled down transfected GST alone but did immunoprecipitate GST-NUAK2 protein. Note that the protein band detected in the SMAD3 immunoprecipitation corresponds to the light chain of the anti-SMAD3 immunoglobulin (marked on the left of the immunoblot), which migrates slightly faster than the GST protein band shown in the first lane of the WCL. C, Myc-tagged domains of SMAD3 (MH1, MH2, linker (L), full-length (FL), MH1-L, and L-MH2) or Myc-tagged empty vector were co-transfected with GST-NUAK2 or GST alone (0.5 μg/DNA plasmid). After 1 day, cells were starved overnight with 2% FBS/DMEM, and the second day post-transfection, they were treated with TGFβ (2 ng/ml) for 2.5 h. Thereafter, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Myc-embedded agarose beads for 1 h. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE in parallel with their respective WCL, and proteins were identified by utilizing NUAK2, Myc, and GST antibodies. The immunoglobulin light chain is also marked. Note that the middle and bottom immunoblots are one and the same; the bottom is an exact duplication of part of the middle immunoblots that are exposed slightly longer to emphasize the lack of GST protein on the immunoprecipitation (left part) and its presence on the WCL (right part). D, NMuMG cells were treated with TGFβ (5 ng/ml) for 2 h, and then following immunoprecipitation with Smad3 or control antiserum, eluents together with WCL were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Nuak2, Smad3, and pSmad3 immunoblotting. E, as in D, HaCaT cells were stimulated with TGFβ (5 ng/ml) for 2 h, and the cell lysates were incubated with SMAD3 antibody or control IgG overnight. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and NUAK2, SMAD3, and pSMAD3 were detected via immunoblotting.

The R2T2 is a combination of the Monte Carlo radiative-transfer, coherent-backscattering, and superposition T-matrix methods. The applicability of the radiative transfer is extended to dense random media by incorporating incoherent volume elements containing multiple particles. We analyze the R2T2 by comparing the results with the asymptotically exact superposition T-matrix method, and show that the R2T2 removes the caveats of radiative-transfer methods by comparing it to the RT-CB. We study various implementation choices that result in an accurate and efficient numerical algorithm.

https://openalex.org/W2909420896,"Context Recent randomised controlled trials in Bangladesh and Kenya concluded that household water treatment, alone or in combination with upgraded sanitation and handwashing, did not reduce linear growth faltering or improve other child growth outcomes. Whether these results are applicable in areas with distinct constellations of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) risks is unknown. Analysis of observational data offers an efficient means to assess the external validity of trial findings. We studied whether a water quality intervention could improve child growth in a rural Indian setting with higher levels of circulating pathogens than the original trial sites. Methods We analysed a cross-sectional dataset including a microbiological measure of household water quality. All households accessed water from an improved source. We applied propensity score methods to emulate a randomised trial investigating the hypothesis that receipt of drinking water meeting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.1 quality standards for absence of faecal contamination leads to improved growth. Growth outcomes (stunting, underweight, wasting, and their corresponding Z-scores) were assessed in children 12–23 months of age. For each outcome, we estimated the mean and 95% confidence interval of the absolute risk difference between treatment groups. Findings Of 1088 households, 442 (40.62%) received drinking water meeting SDG 6.1 standards. The adjusted risk of child underweight was 7.4% (1.3% to 13.4%) lower among those drinking water satisfying SDG 6.1 norms than among controls. Evidence concerning the relationship of drinking water meeting SDG 6.1 norms to length-for-age and weight-for-age was inconclusive, and there was no apparent relationship with stunting or wasting. Conclusions In contexts characterised by high pathogen transmission, water quality improvements have the potential to reduce the proportion of underweight children, but are unlikely to impact stunting or wasting. Further research is required to assess how these modelled benefits can best be achieved in real world settings."

During biosynthesis of lactose in the Golgi complex, H+ is produced as a by-product, and there is no known mechanism for maintaining luminal pH within the physiological range. Here, using conditional, tissue-specific knockout mice, immunostaining, and biochemical assays, we test whether the putative H+/Ca2+/Mn2+ exchanger known as TMEM165 (transmembrane protein 165) participates in normal milk production. We find TMEM165 is crucial in the lactating mammary gland for normal biosynthesis of lactose and for normal growth rates of nursing pups. The milk of TMEM165-deficient mice contained elevated concentrations of fat, protein, iron, and zinc, which are likely caused by decreased osmosis-mediated dilution of the milk caused by the decreased biosynthesis of lactose. When normalized to total protein levels, only calcium and manganese levels were significantly lower in the milk from TMEM165-deficient dams than control dams. These findings suggest that TMEM165 supplies Ca2+ and Mn2+ to the Golgi complex in exchange for H+ to sustain the functions of lactose synthase and potentially other glycosyl-transferases. Our findings highlight the importance of cation and pH homeostasis in the Golgi complex of professional secretory cells and the critical role of TMEM165 in this process.

https://openalex.org/W2909633309,"Pre-harvest contamination of produce has been a major food safety focus. Insight into the behavior of enteric pathogens on produce in pre-harvest conditions will aid in developing pre-harvest and post-harvest risk management strategies. In this study, the attachment strength (SR) and die-off rate of E. coli on the surface of watermelon fruits and the efficacy of aqueous chlorine treatment against strongly attached E. coli population were investigated. Watermelon seedlings were transplanted into eighteen plots. Prior to harvesting, a cocktail of generic E. coli (ATCC 23716, 25922 and 11775) was inoculated on the surface of the watermelon fruits (n = 162) and the attachment strength (SR) values and the daily die-off rates were examined up to 6 days by attachment assay. After 120 h, watermelon samples were treated with aqueous chlorine (150 ppm free chlorine for 3 min). The SR value of the E. coli cells on watermelon surfaces significantly increased (P<0.05) from 0.04 to 0.99 in the first 24 h, which was primarily due to the decrease in loosely attached population, given that the population of strongly attached cells was constant. Thereafter, there was no significant change in SR values, up to 120 h. The daily die-off rate of E. coli ranged from -0.12 to 1.3 log CFU/cm2. The chlorine treatment reduced the E. coli level by 4.2 log CFU/cm2 (initial level 5.6 log CFU/cm2) and 0.62 log CFU/cm2 (initial level 1.8 log CFU/cm2), on the watermelons that had an attachment time of 30 min and 120 h respectively. Overall, our findings revealed that the population of E. coli on watermelon surfaces declined over time in an agricultural environment. Microbial contamination during pre-harvest stages may promote the formation of strongly attached cells on the produce surfaces, which could influence the efficacy of post-harvest washing and sanitation techniques."

One-day data were obtained from 5,364 schoolchildren (7–12 years) from public schools of Florianopolis (South of Brazil), using the validated questionnaire Web-CAAFE (Food Intake and Physical Activity of Schoolchildren). DPs were derived from the frequency of daily consumption of 32 foods/beverages by latent profile analysis. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association of the DPs with sociodemographic variables, physical activity, screen activity and weight status. ‘Traditional’, ‘Monotonous’, and ‘Mixed’ DPs were identified. The percentages of children and adolescents within these profiles were 41.3, 36.3, and 22.4%, respectively. Children and adolescents in the highest tertiles of both PAS and daily frequency of SA had a higher probability to present a ‘Mixed’ DP compared to peers with less PAS and SA. Children and adolescents who reported having a school meal were significantly more likely to present the ‘Traditional’DP, while boys who did not report having a school meal had a higher probability to present the ‘Monotonous’ DP. The DPs were not associated with the year of survey, age, family income, or weight status."

The main Siemens Artiste 6MV and FFF 7MV beams were simulated using the Geant4 toolkit. The simulations were compared with the measurements with an ionization chamber in a water phantom to verify the validation of simulation and tuning the primary electron parameters. Hereafter, other parameters such as surface dose, spectrum, electron contamination, symmetry, flatness/unflatness, slope, and characteristic off-axis changes were discussed for both Flat and FFF mode. The mean electron energy for the FFF beam was 8.8 MeV and 7.5 MeV for Flat 6 MV, the spread energy and spot size of the selected Gaussian distribution source were 0.4 MeV and 1mm, respectively. The dose rate of the FFF beam was 2.8 (2.96) times higher than for the flattened beam for a field size of 10×10 (20×20) cm2. The electron contamination has significant contribution to the surface dose especially for the flattened beam. The penumbra, surface dose and the mean energy of photons decrease by removing the flattening filter. Finally, the results show that off-axis changes have no strong effect on the mean energy of FFF beams, while this effect was more considerable for the flattened beam."

Apex predators are often, but not always, the largest animals of their kind. The living killer whale Orcinus orca is an apex predator in modern world oceans. Here we focus on an earlier apex predator, the late Eocene archaeocete Basilosaurus isis from Wadi Al Hitan in Egypt, and show from stomach contents that it fed on smaller whales (juvenile Dorudon atrox) and large fishes (Pycnodus mokattamensis). Our observations, the first direct evidence of diet in Basilosaurus isis, confirm a predator-prey relationship of the two most frequently found fossil whales in Wadi Al-Hitan, B. isis and D. atrox. This extends our understanding of their paleoecology. Late Eocene Basilosaurus isis, late Miocene Livyatan melvillei, and modern Orcinus orca are three marine apex predators known from relatively short intervals of time. Little is known about whales as apex predators through much of the Cenozoic era, and whales as apex predators deserve more attention than they have received."

Sixty-three rats were divided into three groups (n = 21) according to the pain-relieving therapy used: I-control; II-topical application of Otosporin for 10 min after the bleaching treatment; III-oral administration of paracetamol 30 min before whitening and then every 12h. In all the study groups, placebo gel was applied to the left upper jaw (control) and a 35% H2O2-based whitening gel was applied to the right upper jaw for 45 min. Seven animals from each group were euthanized at different time points: 0h after treatment, 24h, and 48h. After euthanasia, the first molar on each side was analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry to assess the degree of inflammation and verify the presence of the neuropeptides, substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The data were analyzed using the statistical nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's test for individual comparisons. Extensive areas of necrosis were observed in the groups that received bleaching treatment only, whereas reduced damage were obtained in the group treated with Otosporin. The immunohistochemical analysis showed positive immunolabeling in all groups, including the control, but this was stronger in the groups that received bleaching treatment. The best results were obtained in the group that received treatment with Otosporin. The use of Otosporin after dental bleaching minimized the side effects of this treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2908895710,"CORM-3 is a water-soluble carbon monoxide (CO)-releasing molecule developed for possible therapeutic use of CO. CORM-3 belongs to a group of metal carbonyl compounds that contain transition metals and carbonyls as the central scaffold and coordinated ligands, respectively. CORM-3 has been reported to be reactive with many proteins in eukaryotes including mammals. Among them, several extracellular proteins, such as lysozyme, as well as plasma albumin and fibronectin, have been shown to interact directly with CORM-3. p62 is an intracellular adaptor protein required for targeting ubiquitinated (Ub) proteins to lysosomal degradation through autophagy. p62 has been shown to undergo self-oligomerization via covalent crosslinking in response to treatment with verteporfin, a benzoporphyrin derivative used for photodynamic therapy. Here we show that CORM-3 also interacts directly with p62. When applied to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) at a high concentration (1 mM), CORM-3 causes the formation of reduction- and detergent-resistant high molecular weight (HMW)-p62. HMW-p62 accumulates more in atg5-/- MEFs than in wild type (WT) MEFs, showing the elimination of HMW-p62 through autophagy. HMW-p62 is also generated in H9c2 rat cardiomyoblastoma as well as A549 human alveolar epithelial cells, suggesting that HMW-p62 formation is not specific to MEFs, but, rather, is a general event in mammalian cells. HMW-p62 formation by CORM-3 can be reproduced using purified p62 in vitro, demonstrating the direct interaction between CORM-3 and p62. These results show that p62 is a CORM-3-interactive intracellular protein."
https://openalex.org/W2908938349,"Objectives To evaluate the prevalence of off-label and unlicensed prescribing in inpatients at a major paediatric teaching hospital in Western Australia and to identify which drugs are commonly prescribed off-label or unlicensed, including factors influencing such prescribing. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in June, 2013. Patient and prescribing data were collected from 190 inpatient medication chart records which had been randomly selected from all admissions during the second week of February 2013. Drugs were categorised as licensed, off-label or unlicensed, according to their approved Australian registration product information (PI). All drugs were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code. Results There were 120 male and 70 female inpatients. The average age was 6.0 years (± 4.7). The study included 1160 prescribed drugs suitable for analysis. The number of drugs prescribed per patient ranged from 1 to 25 with an average of 6.1 (± 4.3). More than half (54%) were prescribed off-label. Oxycodone, clonidine, parecoxib and midazolam were always prescribed off-label. The most common off-label drugs were ondansetron (18.5%), fentanyl (12.9%), oxycodone (8.8%) and paracetamol (6.1%). Many ATC classifications included high off-label proportions especially the genitourinary system and sex hormones, respiratory system drugs, systemic hormonal preparations and alimentary tract and metabolism drugs. Conclusions This study highlights that prescribing of paediatric drugs needs to be better supported by existing and new evidence. Incentives should be established to foster the conduct of evidence-based studies in the paediatric population. The current level of off-label prescribing raises issues of unexpected toxicity and adverse drug effects in children that are in some cases severely ill."
https://openalex.org/W2908811994,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the response of estrogen target cells to a series of isoflavone glucosides and aglycones from Genista halacsyi Heldr. The methanolic extract of aerial parts of this plant was processed using fast centrifugal partition chromatography, resulting in isolation of four archetypal isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, isoprunetin, 8-C-β-D-glucopyranosyl-genistein) and ten derivatives thereof. 7-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-genistein and 7,4΄-di-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-genistein were among the most abundant constituents of the isolate. All fourteen, except genistein, displayed low binding affinity for estrogen receptors (ER). Models of binding to ERα could account for the low binding affinity of monoglucosides. Genistein and its glucosides displayed full efficacy in inducing alkaline phosphatase (AlkP) in Ishikawa cells, proliferation of MCF-7 cells and ER-dependent gene expression in reporter cells at low concentrations (around 0.3 μM). ICI182,780 fully antagonized these effects. The AlkP-inducing efficacy of the fourteen isoflavonoids was more strongly correlated with their transcriptional efficacy through ERα. O-monoglucosides displayed higher area under the dose-response curve (AUC) of AlkP response relative to the AUC of ERα-transcriptional response compared to the respective aglycones. In addition, 7-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-genistein and 7,4΄-di-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-genistein displayed estradiol-like efficacy in promoting differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells to osteoblasts, while genistein was not convincingly effective in this respect. Moreover, 7,4΄-di-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-genistein suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor mRNA expression in RAW 264.7 cells, while 7-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-genistein was not convincingly effective and genistein was ineffective. However, genistein and its O-glucosides were ineffective in inhibiting differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells to osteoclasts and in protecting glutamate-challenged HT22 hippocampal neurons from oxidative stress-induced cell death. These findings suggest that 7-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-genistein and 7,4΄-di-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-genistein display higher estrogen-like and/or anti-inflammatory activity compared to the aglycone. The possibility of using preparations rich in O-β-D-glucopyranosides of genistein to substitute for low-dose estrogen in formulations for menopausal symptoms is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2909494551,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main cause of chronic airway infection in cystic fibrosis (CF). However, for unclear reasons some patients are never colonized by P. aeruginosa. The objectives of this study were to better define the clinical, genetic, and microbiological characteristics of such a subpopulation and to identify predictive factors of non-colonization with P. aeruginosa. The French CF patient registry 2013–2014 was used to identify CF patients aged ≥ 20 years. The clinical outcomes, CF Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) genotypes, and microbiological data of patients reported positive at least once for P. aeruginosa (“Pyo” group, n = 1,827) were compared to those of patients with no history of P. aeruginosa isolation (“Never” group, n = 303). Predictive factors of non-colonization by P. aeruginosa were identified by multivariate logistic regression model with backward selection. Absence of aspergillosis (odds ratio (OR) [95% CI] = 1.64 [1.01–2.66]), absence of diabetes (2.25 [1.21–4.18]), pancreatic sufficiency (1.81 [1.30–2.52]), forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1) ≥ 80% (3.03 [2.28–4.03]), older age at CF diagnosis (1.03 [1.02–1.04]), and absence of F508del/F508del genotype (2.17 [1.48–3.19]) were predictive clinical factors associated with absence of infection (“Never” group). Microbiologically, this same group was associated with more frequent detection of Haemophilus influenzae and lower rates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Aspergillus spp. (all p<0.01) in sputum. This study strongly suggests that the absence of pulmonary colonization by P. aeruginosa in a minority of CF adults (14.2%) is associated with a milder form of the disease. Recent progress in the development of drugs to correct CFTR deficiency thus may be decisive in the control of P. aeruginosa lung infection."

https://openalex.org/W2910590818,"G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central players in recognizing a variety of stimuli to mediate diverse cellular responses. This myriad of functions is accomplished by their modular interactions with downstream intracellular transducers, such as heterotrimeric G proteins and arrestins. Assembling a specific GPCR–G protein pair as a purified complex for their structural and functional investigations remains a challenging task, however, because of the low affinity of the interaction. Here, we optimized fusion constructs of the Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein and engineered versions of rat Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1), coexpressed and assembled in vivo with Gβ and Gγ. This was achieved by using the baculovirus-based MultiBac system. We thus generated a functional receptor–G protein fusion complex, which can be efficiently purified using ligand-based affinity chromatography on large scales. Additionally, we utilized a purification method based on a designed ankyrin repeat protein tightly binding to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP-DARPin) that may be used as a generic approach for a large-scale purification of GPCR–G protein fusion complexes for which no ligands column can be generated. The purification methods described herein will support future studies that aim to understand the structural and functional framework of GPCR activation and signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2908547679,"One of the greatest obstacles to clinical translation of bone tissue engineering is the inability to effectively and efficiently vascularize scaffolds. The goal of this work was to explore systematically whether architecture, at a scale of hundreds of microns, can be used to direct the growth of microcapillary-like structures into the core of scaffolds. Biphasic bioceramic patterned architectures were produced using silicone molds of 3D printed parts. Grooves and ridges were designed to have widths of 330 μm and 660 μm, with periodicities respectively of 1240 μm and 630 μm. Groove depth was varied between 150 μm and 585 μm. Co-cultures of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) and human osteoblasts (hOBs) were used to grow microcapillary-like structures on substrates. Bioceramic architecture was found to significantly affect microcapillary-like structure location and orientation. Microcapillary-like structures were found to form predominantly in grooves or between convexities. For all patterned samples, the CD31 (endothelial cell marker) signal was at least 2.5 times higher along grooves versus perpendicular to grooves. In addition, the average signal was at least two times higher within grooves than outside grooves for all samples. Grooves with a width of 330 μm and a depth of 300 μm resulted in the formation of individual, highly aligned microcapillary-like structures with lengths around 5 mm. Extensive literature has focused on the role of nano- and micro-topography (on the scale below tens of microns) on cellular response. However, the idea that architecture at a scale much larger than a cell could be used to modulate angiogenesis has not been systematically investigated. This work shows the crucial influence of architecture on microcapillary-like structure self-assembly at the scale of hundreds of microns. Elucidating the precise correspondence between architecture and microcapillary-like structure organization will ultimately allow the engineering of microvasculature by tuning local scaffold design to achieve desirable microvessel properties."
https://openalex.org/W2909061367,"Chromosomal aberrations, such as micronuclei (MN), have served as biomarkers of genotoxic exposure and cancer risk. Guidelines for the process of scoring MN have been presented by the HUman MicroNucleus (HUMN) project. However, these guidelines were developed for assay performance but do not address how to statistically analyze the data generated by the assay. This has led to the application of various statistical methods that may render different interpretations and conclusions. By combining MN with data from other high-throughput genomic technologies such as gene expression microarray data, we may elucidate molecular features involved in micronucleation. Traditional methods that can model discrete (synonymously, count) data, such as MN frequency, require that the number of explanatory variables (P) is less than the number of samples (N). Due to this limitation, penalized models have been developed to enable model fitting for such over-parameterized datasets. Because penalized models in the discrete response setting are lacking, particularly when the count outcome is over-dispersed, herein we present our penalized negative binomial regression model that can be fit when P > N. Using simulation studies we demonstrate the performance of our method in comparison to commonly used penalized Poisson models when the outcome is over-dispersed and applied it to MN frequency and gene expression data collected as part of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Our countgmifs R package is available for download from the Comprehensive R Archive Network and can be applied to datasets having a discrete outcome that is either Poisson or negative binomial distributed and a high-dimensional covariate space."
https://openalex.org/W2909281191,"Cilia are conserved microtubule-based organelles that function as mechanical and chemical sensors in various cell types. By bioinformatic, genomic, and proteomic studies, more than 2000 proteins have been identified as cilium-associated proteins or putative ciliary proteins; these proteins are referred to as the ciliary proteome or the ciliome. However, little is known about the function of these numerous putative ciliary proteins in cilia. To identify the possible new functional proteins or pathways in cilia, we carried out a small-scale genetic screen targeting 54 putative ciliary genes by using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system. We successfully constructed 54 zebrafish mutants, and 8 of them displayed microphthalmias. Three of these 8 genes encode proteins for protein transport, suggesting the important roles of protein transport in retinal development. In situ hybridization revealed that all these genes are expressed in zebrafish eyes. Furthermore, polo-like kinase 1 was required for ciliogenesis in neural tube. We uncovered the potential function of the ciliary genes for the retinal development of zebrafish.-Hu, R., Huang, W., Liu, J., Jin, M., Wu, Y., Li, J., Wang, J., Yu, Z., Wang, H., Cao, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2909428458,"We investigated the effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) on angiotensin II (Ang II)-triggered hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Activation of PPARδ by GW501516, a specific ligand of PPARδ, significantly inhibited Ang II-stimulated protein synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner, as determined by [3H]-leucine incorporation. GW501516-activated PPARδ also suppressed Ang II-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in VSMCs. Transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against PPARδ significantly reversed the effects of GW501516 on [3H]-leucine incorporation and ROS generation, indicating that PPARδ is involved in these effects. By contrast, these GW501516-mediated actions were potentiated in VSMCs transfected with siRNA against NADPH oxidase (NOX) 1 or 4, suggesting that ligand-activated PPARδ elicits these effects by modulating NOX-mediated ROS generation. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 also inhibited Ang II-stimulated [3H]-leucine incorporation and ROS generation by preventing membrane translocation of Rac1. These observations suggest that PPARδ is an endogenous modulator of Ang II-triggered hypertrophy of VSMCs, and is thus a potential target to treat vascular diseases associated with hypertrophic changes of VSMCs."

However, the role of bone marrow-derived cells (BMCs) in induction of thermogenic adipocytes is unresolved. The purpose of this study is to examine whether BMCs are involved in the emergence of thermogenic adipocytes through adrenergic activation. Irradiation of mice with 8 Gy of X-ray-depleted BMCs and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs), which in turn impaired induction of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) through administration of β3 adrenergic receptor agonist, CL 316,243 (CL), in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT). In contrast, CL-induced UCP1 induction in brown adipose tissue was unaffected by BMC depletion. Transplantation of normal BMCs into mice depleted of BMCs recovered PBMC levels and rescued the ability of iWAT browning by CL. Furthermore, analyses of mice transplanted with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled BMCs revealed that the number of GFP-positive BMCs and PBMCs were significantly decreased by CL and that GFP-positive stromal cells and GFP-positive UCP1-expressing multilocular adipocytes appeared in iWAT after CL administration, demonstrating differentiation of BMC-derived preadipocytes into UCP1-expressing thermogenic adipocytes. These results unveiled a crucial role of the BMC as a nonresident origin for a subset of thermogenic adipocytes, contributing to browning of white adipose tissue.-Yoneshiro, T., Shin, W., Machida, K., Fukano, K., Tsubota, A., Chen, Y., Yasui, H., Inanami, O., Okamatsu-Ogura, Y., Kimura, K.

Responses to changing intracellular Ca2+ involves Ca2+-sensing proteins that contain high-affinity Ca2+-binding sites. As members of the neuronal Ca2+ sensor gene family, KChIPs contain Ca2+-binding EF hands, two each in N- and C-terminal lobules (13An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W.

Only the two C-terminal EF hands (EF-3 and EF-4) are thought to bind Ca2+ under normal conditions, whereas the N-terminal EF-hands are degenerated such that EF-1 does not bind Ca2+ and EF-2 binds Mg2+ preferentially over Ca2+ (18Chen C.P.

The EF-hands of KChIP family members are highly conserved suggesting that Ca2+ binding is important for KChIP function.

Understanding the contribution of Ca2+ to KChIP regulation of Kv4 complexes is of great interest because it suggests the potential for feedback regulation in neurons. Many studies have made mutations to the EF-hands of KChIP family members to tease apart relative functions for EF-2, EF-3, and EF-4 in Kv4 regulation (13An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P.

Although this approach is informative, Ca2+ binding and intrinsic structural roles for the EF-hands cannot be dissociated. However, published studies examining the role of intracellular Ca2+ in regulation of KChIP–Kv4.2 complexes have been performed in several different cell types, using various KChIP/Kv4 family members and differing methods for elevating or reducing intracellular Ca2+. Thus, there are inconsistencies in the literature regarding Ca2+-KChIP regulation of Kv4 function. Differing reports have shown Ca2+ may either retain or disrupt KChIP-Kv binding, increase or decrease channel currents, or alter channel gating in various ways (13An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J.

Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 are the most abundant Kv4 subunits expressed in excitable tissues, including the heart and brain. In area CA1 of the hippocampus Kv4.2 predominates and is responsible for the A-type current in pyramidal neuron dendrites. Significant functional diversity in A-type currents may arise through the multiple 5′ start sites and alternative N-terminal exons in the four Kcnip genes that generates 17 different proteins with diverse tissue-specific expression patterns (14Pruunsild P. Timmusk T. Structure, alternative splicing, and expression of the human and mouse KCNIP gene family.Genomics. 2005; 86 (16112838): 581-59310.1016/j.ygeno.2005.07.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Jerng H.H.

In situ hybridization localization of KChIPs 1–4 suggest that KChIP2 and KChIP4 are the most abundant KChIPs in area CA1 of the hippocampus (14Pruunsild P. Timmusk T.

In the future, more sensitive measurements of KChIP splice isoform expression are needed to determine how spatial differences may lead to region and cell-type specificity of Kv4 regulation. Although much research has focused on the role of the EF-hands in binding Ca2+, the influence of the variable N-terminal regions on Ca2+ regulation remains unclear. In this study, we show that elevated intracellular Ca2+ regulates Kv4 function by increasing current density. Ca2+ regulation is conserved across the Kv4 family but is specific to short isoforms of KChIP2 and to KChIP3a. A shared basic and hydrophobic N-terminal domain in KChIP2a1 and KChIP2a confers resistance to Kv4 regulation by intracellular Ca2+. KChIPs 1–4 are all assumed to bind Ca2+ under normal circumstances; however, KChIP2c has previously been reported to bind to Kv4.2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner (25Bähring R. Dannenberg J. Peters H.C. Leicher T. Pongs O. Isbrandt D. Conserved Kv4 N-terminal domain critical for effects of Kv channel-interacting protein 2.2 on channel expression and gating.J. Biol.

We first determined whether KChIP2c maintained regulation of Kv4.2 channels in nominal Ca2+ (0 Ca2+, 10 mm EGTA). To assess KChIP2c regulation of Kv4.2 currents, we expressed Kv4.2 alone (Fig. 1a) or in the presence of KChIP2c (Fig. 1b) in HEK293T cells and performed whole-cell patch–clamp electrophysiology (Fig. 1c). KChIP2c regulation of Kv4.2 peak currents were measured using a voltage-clamp protocol. Because Kv4 channels inactivate at relatively hyperpolarized holding potentials (−70.24 ± 0.91 mV; Table 1), a pre-pulse to −120 mV is used to alleviate latent inactivation. A step to +60 mV elicits an outward K+ current carried by Kv4.2 channels (Fig. 1d). As predicted from the established literature (25Bähring R. Dannenberg J. Peters H.C. Leicher T. Pongs O. Isbrandt D. Conserved Kv4 N-terminal domain critical for effects of Kv channel-interacting protein 2.2 on channel expression and gating.J. Biol.

When fit to a double exponential (Fig. S1), KChip2c coexpression slowed the fast rate of inactivation ~3-fold (Fig. 1g) but had no effect on the second, slower component of decay (Fig. 1h). After stepping through a series of increasing voltages, we found that KChIP2c coexpression had no effect on the voltage dependence of activation (VDA) for Kv4.2; however, KChIP2c shifted the VDI to more depolarized potentials as described previously for most KChIP family members (Fig. 1i; Table 1) (15Jerng H.H. Pfaffinger P.J. Modulatory mechanisms and multiple functions of somatodendritic A-type K+ channel auxiliary subunits.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2014; 8 (24723849): 82Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). KChIP2c coexpression also dramatically accelerated the RFI as shown by others (Fig. 1j; Table 1) (25Bähring R. Dannenberg J. Peters H.C. Leicher T. Pongs O. Isbrandt D. Conserved Kv4 N-terminal domain critical for effects of Kv channel-interacting protein 2.2 on channel expression and gating.J. Biol.

Based on these results, we can confirm that at low-intracellular free Ca2+ (0 Ca2+/10 mm EGTA), KChIP2c regulation of Kv4 current is intact.Table 1Biophysical properties of Kv4 family members in nominal 0 μm free Ca2+ (gray boxes) or ~10 μm free Ca2+ (red boxes)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)* and # represent statistical significance (0.05 > p > 0.0001) by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-test (Kv4, 0 μm Ca2+ versus Kv4, KChIP, 0 μm Ca2+, or Kv4, KChIP, 10 μm Ca2+ (*); Kv4, KChIP, 0 μm Ca2+ versus Kv4; KChIP, 10 μm Ca2+ (#).

To assess the Ca2+ dependence of Kv4.2 function, whole-cell patch–clamp recordings were performed in either nominal Ca2+ (0 Ca2+ and 10 mm EGTA) or ~10 μm Ca2+ (5 mm Ca2+/10 mm hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine-N,N′,N′-triacetic acid (HEDTA)) (Fig. 2, a and b). Although the high affinity Ca2+ chelator EGTA is ideal for maintaining low levels of intracellular Ca2+, even small pipetting errors can lead to large differences in free Ca2+ above 1 μm. Intracellular free Ca2+ is better clamped within the 10 μm range using the low-affinity Ca2+ buffer HEDTA (29Ben-Johny M. Yang P.S. Niu J. Yang W. Joshi-Mukherjee R. Yue D.T. Conservation of Ca2+/calmodulin regulation across Na and Ca2+ channels.Cell. 2014; 157 (24949975): 1657-167010.1016/j.cell.2014.04.035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In cells expressing Kv4.2 alone, 10 μm Ca2+ affected neither K+ current density, VDA, VDI, or RFI (Fig. 2c; Table 2). To assess whether Ca2+ regulates Kv4.2 channels through KChIP auxiliary proteins we coexpressed KChIP2c. Coexpression of KChIP2c enhanced K+ current density under nominal Ca2+ as described above (Fig. 1e, and Fig. 2d; Table 1); however, in the presence of KChIP2c and ~10 μm Ca2+, K+ current density was increased, whereas VDA, VDI, and RFI were not affected (Fig. 2d; Table 1). To determine whether the Ca2+ regulated increase in current density was evident in the presence of another obligatory Kv4 subunit DPP6, we measured the same electrophysiological parameters in cells coexpressing Kv4.2, KChIP2c, and DPP6 (Fig. 2e). Although the trend for a Ca2+-regulated increase in peak current density remained, it did not achieve statistical significance (Fig. 2e; Table 2). The effect of Ca2+ was most pronounced on Kv4.2–KChIP2c K+ currents elicited at the peak of the G-V curve. To more closely examine the effects of Ca2+ on peak currents, we analyzed both the magnitude and kinetics of Kv4.2 currents evoked with a single voltage step to +60 mV in HEK293T cells expressing Kv4.2 and KChIP2c (Fig. 3a). As observed previously, peak K+ currents were larger in magnitude in the presence of 10 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 3, a and b). Additionally, Ca2+ accelerated the 10–90% rise time and the fast τ1 of current decay while leaving the second, slower τ2 component unchanged (Fig. 3, c–e). However, Ca2+ regulation of 10–90% rise time also occurred in the absence of KChIP2c suggesting this is a KChIP-independent effect (Table 2). Taken together, elevated intracellular Ca2+ regulates Kv4.2 current density and requires the presence of KChIP2c.Table 2Comparison of biophysical properties between Kv4.2-KChIP2 isoform complexes in nominal 0 μm free Ca2+ (gray) or 10 μm free Ca2+ (red)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)* represents statistical significance (0.05 > p > 0.0001) by unpaired t test.

It is impossible to get resources back that already have been invested. Hence, economic theory implies that decision makers’ decisions should only be guided by future gains and losses. According to the literature, the sunk-cost fallacy is driven by negative affect. Previous studies focused on negative incidental affect. We investigated, in contrast, whether the sunk-cost fallacy is caused by integral affect elicited by the specific decision context. Study 1 demonstrated a positive relationship between affective reaction and the sunk-cost fallacy. Study 2 replicated the finding in Study 1 in a within-subjects design, and demonstrated a full mediation of type of scenario (invest vs. non-invest) on the sunk-cost effect, mediated by integral affective reaction. A mediation using a within-subjects design additionally demonstrated that the effect is mediated by integral emotional responses experienced in relation to each scenario, and not by incidental emotional states that are unrelated to the scenarios. Study 3 replicated findings in the previous studies, and demonstrated that the relation between the sunk-cost fallacy and affect is moderated by justification. Participants who justified their decision were more resistant to the sunk-cost fallacy, and showed less negative affect elicited by the scenarios, than participants who did not justify their decision. Study 4 provided supporting evidence for our hypothesis by hindering conscious deliberation, and promoting reliance on affect, via cognitive load. The results showed that the relation between affect and the sunk-cost fallacy was stronger for participants under high cognitive load, than under low-load. The paper discussed how this research leads to new ways to protect against the sunk-cost fallacy in the discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2911040325,"Introduction In Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), community-based health insurance (CBHI) is the only voluntary insurance scheme; it typically targets self-employed people, most of whom reside in rural areas and are dependent on agricultural activities for subsistence. However, until very recently, the enrollment rate has fallen short and failed to reach a large percentage of the target group. To promote the CBHI scheme and increase demand, some supporting components should be considered for inclusion together with the health infrastructure component. Objectives This paper provides empirical evidence that the benefit package components of hypothetical CBHI schemes have causal effects on enrollment probabilities. Furthermore, we examine the distribution of willingness to pay (WTP) in response to policy changes based on a sample of 5,800 observations. Methods A randomized conjoint experiment is conducted in rural villages in Savannakhet Province, Lao PDR, to elicit stated preference data. Each respondent ranks three options—two hypothetical alternatives and the CBHI status quo scheme. The levels of seven attributes—insurance coverage for medical consultations, hospitalizations, traffic accidents, pharmaceuticals and transportation; premiums; and prepaid discounts—are randomly and simultaneously assigned to the two alternatives. Results The findings suggest that the average WTP is at least as large as 10.9% of the per capita income of those who live in rural areas, which is higher than the WTP for health insurance averaged across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the literature. The component of round-trip transportation insurance coverage has a significant effect on WTP distribution, particularly increasing the share of the highest bin. Conclusion Therefore, the low CBHI scheme enrollment rate in Lao PDR does not necessarily imply low demand among the targeted population, as the finding from the WTP analysis illustrates potential demand for the CBHI scheme. Specifically, if transportation is addressed, enrollment is likely to significantly increase."

Methodology Nine randomized phase 3 clinical trials employing biological agents at the National Cancer Institute of Napoli, Italy, were analyzed to indentify “per patient” costs of each trial, according to the ABC methodology. The average consumption of resources for a patient completing the entire planned treatment was estimated for each trial. Through interviews of the personnel (doctors, nurses and technicians) and by analyses of the clinical trials protocols, the main activities of the 9 clinical trials were identified and, for each trial, the complete health care pathway of the patients and the treatment programmes were minutely reconstructed. Drug costs were not included because provided by Sponsors. Principal findings The average costs of the pre-study, treatment, monitoring, follow-up, audit, and administrative activities accounted for 2.357, 4.783, 700, 372, 1.263, and 9 Euro, respectively. The average total cost estimated for all “per patient” activities, including overhead costs, was 11.379 Euro. Staff costs accounted for € 5.988, while costs of diagnostic test accounted for 3.494 Euro. Clinical trials with immunotherapeutic drugs accounted for higher costs (+601 Euro as oncological staff costs, +1.318 Euro as intermediate services cost and +384 Euro as overheads). Conclusions The average total cost estimated for all “per patient” activities of a clinical trial with new anticancer biological agents was 11.379 Euro using the ABC methodology."
https://openalex.org/W2953040473,"Peptide drugs have been used in the treatment of multiple pathologies. During peptide discovery, it is crucially important to be able to map the potential sites of cleavages of the proteases. This knowledge is used to later chemically modify the peptide drug to adapt it for the therapeutic use, making peptide stable against individual proteases or in complex medias. In some other cases it needed to make it specifically unstable for some proteases, as peptides could be used as a system to target delivery drugs on specific tissues or cells. The information about proteases, their sites of cleavages and substrates are widely spread across publications and collected in databases such as MEROPS. Therefore, it is possible to develop models to improve the understanding of the potential peptide drug proteolysis. We propose a new workflow to derive protease specificity rules and predict the potential scissile bonds in peptides for individual proteases. WebMetabase stores the information from experimental or external sources in a chemically aware database where each peptide and site of cleavage is represented as a sequence of structural blocks connected by amide bonds and characterized by its physicochemical properties described by Volsurf descriptors. Thus, this methodology could be applied in the case of non-standard amino acid. A frequency analysis can be performed in WebMetabase to discover the most frequent cleavage sites. These results were used to train several models using logistic regression, support vector machine and ensemble tree classifiers to map cleavage sites for several human proteases from four different families (serine, cysteine, aspartic and matrix metalloproteases). Finally, we compared the predictive performance of the developed models with other available public tools PROSPERous and SitePrediction."
https://openalex.org/W2908836264,"Little is known about the precise date of the emergence of decapitation in a ritual context and the presence of systematic postmortem modification patterns in the ancient Central Andes. The ceremonial complex at Pacopampa in the northern Peruvian highlands provides early osteological evidence of decapitation in six individuals dating to the latter half of the Late-Final Formative Periods (500-50 BC) and to the Early Cajamarca Period (AD 200-450). Based on osteological evidence, and when taken together with archaeological settings and settlement patterns, researchers can be certain that those whose heads were disembodied were not likely to have been involved in organized battles. In addition, the similarities in the cut-mark distribution, direction, and cross-sectional morphology of each individual's remains, as well as the characteristics of selected individuals, imply that the decapitated individuals were carefully prepared using a standardized method and that those who modified the heads may have been professional decapitators. This study offers indisputable bioarchaeological evidence of ritualistic offerings of human skulls and systematic postmortem modification patterns, which is consistent with a contemporaneous iconographic motif of decapitation and extends the chronology of this practice back to the Formative Period in the northern Peruvian highlands."
https://openalex.org/W2910010775,"Background In most western countries a shortage of general practitioners (GP) exists. Newly qualified GPs often prefer to work in teams rather than in single-handed practices. Therefore, new practices offering these kinds of working conditions will be attractive in the future. From a health care point of view, the location planning of new practices will be a crucial aspect. In this work we studied solutions for locating GP practices in a defined administrative district under different objectives. Methods Using operations research (OR), a research discipline that originated from logistics, different possible locations of GP practices were identified for the considered district. Models were developed under two main basic requirements: that one practice can be reached by as many inhabitants as possible and to cut down the driving time for every district’s inhabitant to the next practice location to less than 15 minutes. Input data included the demand (population), driving times and the current GP locations. Results Three different models were analysed ranging from one single practice solution to five different practices. The whole administrative district can reach the central community “A” in at most 23 minutes by car. Considering a maximum driving time of 15 minutes, locations in four different cities in the district would be sufficient. Conclusion Operations research methods can be used to determine locations for (new) GP practices. Depending on the concrete problem different models and approaches lead to varying solutions. These results must be discussed with GPs, mayors and patients to find robust locations regarding future developments."
