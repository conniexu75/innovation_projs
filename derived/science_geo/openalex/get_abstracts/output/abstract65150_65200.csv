https://openalex.org/W1489298252,"Abstract Transport of methotrexate (4-amino-10-methylpteroyl-glutamic acid), a structural analogue of folic acid, was studied in L1210 mouse leukemia cells grown in tissue culture. Intracellular methotrexate was present in two states. (a) There was an essentially nonexchangeable intracellular fraction probably bound to the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. (b) The remaining intracellular methotrexate was rapidly exchangeable and likely present in the cell water in an osmotically active state. In addition, there was a small rapidly exchanging component of methotrexate associated with the cells which had the characteristics of a loose adsorption on or near to the cell membrane. Methotrexate was shown to be negligibly metabolized by this cell system. Because of the presence of tight intracellular binding sites for methotrexate, prior to saturation of these sites, free intracellular methotrexate does not appear and consequently efflux is negligible. This permits the accurate measurement of unidirectional uptake velocities. The major portion of the unidirectional influx process demonstrated Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a high degree of structural specificity, competitive inhibition by folic and folinic acids, and marked temperature dependence. Addition of these competing substances in excess to cells at the steady state with extracellular methotrexate leads to countertransport of intracellular methotrexate. Electrochemical potential gradients for free intracellular methotrexate were demonstrated at low levels of extracellular methotrexate and intracellular methotrexate concentrations at equilibrium exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Efflux of intracellular methotrexate was not first order and appeared to be partially saturated. The Michaelis constant and maximum velocity for the unidirectional efflux process were estimated, and when related to these parameters for the unidirectional influx, were compatible with an accumulating system. These studies indicate that methotrexate transport in the L1210 cell is carrier-mediated and uphill. Methotrexate exhibits several qualities which make it a valuable model substrate for the study of the transport characteristics of folic acid and its naturally occurring derivatives. The implication of these findings with respect to the development of more effective folic acid antagonists is considered."
https://openalex.org/W1519699837,"Abstract A rapid, convenient and sensitive assay method for measuring tryptophan 5-monooxygenase in mammalian brain is developed with l-tryptophan-carboxyl-14C as substrate. The method is based on the differing affinity of aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase toward l-tryptophan and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan (Km values for l-tryptophan and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan are approximately 1.4 x 10-2 m and 5.4 x 10-6 m, respectively). The reaction is carried out in the presence of an excess amount of the decarboxylase, and the radioactive CO2 preferentially liberated from 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan, which is formed from l-tryptophan-14C by the action of tryptophan 5-monooxygenase, is measured. Tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activity is detected in both the soluble and particulate fractions from the guinea pig brain stem. When relatively low concentrations (below 10-5 m) of l-tryptophan-(side chain-1,2,3-14C) are used as substrate and incubated with the supernatant or the crude mitochondrial fractions in the presence of monoamine oxidase inhibitor, the radioactive CO2 evolved is almost entirely accounted for by the formation of serotonin-14C. Only small amounts of tryptamine-14C are produced and very little 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan-14C accumulates in the reaction mixture. Properties of tryptophan 5-monooxygenase in both the supernatant and crude mitochondrial fractions are examined and the appropriate conditions for the assay are described."
https://openalex.org/W2005333955,p-Chlorophenylalanine depletes brain serotonin and induces longlasting sexual excitation in male rats. The effect of p-chlorophenylalanine is potentiated by pargyline. Administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan to rats treated with p-chlorophenylalanine plus pargyline blocks the sexual excitation. p-Chlorophenylalanine also elicits sexual excitation in pinealectomized rats; this effect is not mediated by the lack of indole hormones in the pineal but may be the consequence of depletion of 5-hydroxytryptophan in the brain and the resulting imbalance between 5-hydroxytryptophan and catecholamine activity in the central nervous system.

The incidences of both cystic kidney and cleft palate were increased in the C57BL/6 mice as well as the incidence of cleft palate in the AKR mice. The incidence of cystic kidney was also increased in the rats. In addition, an increase in the ratio of liver weight to body weight in the mouse fetus and the occurrence of hemorrhagic gastrointestinal tract in the rat fetus suggest that this compound also has fetotoxic properties."

Mutations to high-level resistance to this antibiotic map close to the streptomycin locus, and the site of action of spectinomycin, like that of streptomycin, is the 30S ribosomal subunit, as shown by experiments with reconstituted 70S ribosomes containing subunits from sensitive and from resistant ribosomes. In contrast to streptomycin, however, spectinomycin is not bactericidal and causes no detectable misreading of polyribonucleotides."

A hemagglutination-inhibition test with rabbit antibody to highly purified (10,000-fold) factor VIII from humans was used. Serums and plasmas from eight patients with von Willebrand's disease showed little or no factor VIII activity in this test, an indication that the test may serve as a specific assay for differentiation between von Willebrand's disease and hemophilia A."
https://openalex.org/W2080639611,"Observations made with a scanning electron microscope confirm the binding of the stereocilia to a matchhead-like bulbous terminal at the apex of the kinocilium in frog saccular receptor cells. Since the kinocilium is shown to rest on a portion of the receptor cell that lacks the rigid cuticular base of the stereocilia, movenment of the ciliary ensemble results in a ""plunging-like"" effect of the kinocilium which produces a distension of the membranc at its base. This membrane distension is envisaged as bringing about the ionic conductance changes necessary for the production of a generator potential and, thus, for the transduction of movement into vestibular nerve activity."
https://openalex.org/W1572454647,"Abstract The T4 DNA polymerase catalyzes extensive exonucleolytic degradation of linear duplex DNA starting at the 3' ends. However, the enzyme will release only a few nucleotides from each DNA molecule if the degradation is run in the presence of a single deoxynucleoside triphosphate. Several experiments suggested that the polymerase degrades a chain only until a nucleotide is released which can be replaced by transfer from the triphosphate. Subsequent reaction consists only of alternating removal and replacement of that nucleotide, without net degradation of the DNA. Because only a few nucleotides are released in the presence of a single triphosphate, it seemed possible that the polymerase could be used for analysis of nucleotide sequences at 3' termini of duplex DNA. This possibility was verified by the analysis of the 3'-terminal sequence of fragments of bacteriophage T7 DNA produced by endonuclease R, the Hemophilus influenzae restriction endonuclease. This terminal sequence had been previously identified by Kelly and Smith (J. Mol. Biol., 51, 393 (1970)). The method used in this analysis, which should also be applicable to other DNAs, was to degrade 32P-labeled DNA by the T4 polymerase in the presence of each of the four triphosphates. The nucleotides released in each case were identified and quantitatively determined by thin layer chromatography, and were consistent with the previously determined terminal sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1570631785,"Abstract A procedure is described for isolation in a soluble form of a ribonucleic acid polymerase from rat testes. Evidence is presented that this enzyme catalyzes three distinct reactions: (a) deoxyribonucleic acid-directed synthesis of RNA in the presence of all four major ribonucleoside triphosphates; (b) DNA-primed formation of polyadenylic acid and other ribohomopolymers in the presence of single ribonucleoside triphosphate substrates; (c) synthesis of complementary polyribonucleotides in the presence of various ribohomopolymer primers. The properties of these reactions are discussed with respect to metal ion requirements, affinities for ribonucleoside triphosphates and primer polynucleotides, heat denaturation of DNA primers, and the effects of ionic strength, β-mercaptoethanol, polyamines, temperature, and inhibitors on the rates and extent of the reactions. The testicular ribonucleic acid polymerase is a very unstable enzyme that can be stabilized by high concentrations of glycerol."

The enzyme having a specific activity of 130 units per mg shows one major band and two minor bands upon disc electrophoresis. Some properties, including molecular weight, stability, and the inhibition of enzyme activity by hemin are reported. The comparative behavior of crude and purified enzyme toward oxidizing and reducing agents is discussed. Although δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase functions in a regulatory capacity, it apparently lacks some characteristics generally observed with allosteric enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2088577015,"SINCE the reports of the anti-inflammatory activity of indomethacin (1-p-chlorobenzoyl-5-methoxy-2-methyl-indol-3-ylacetic acid)1 and ibufenac (p-isobutylphenylacetic acid)2, there has been much interest in the pharmacological properties of aryl and heteroarylalkanoic acids. This paper describes the anti-inflammatory activity found in two series of new alkanoic acids, namely the 2,4-di-phenylthiazol-5-ylacetic acids (I) and the β-(4,5-diphenyl-oxazol-2-yl) propionic acids (II). The thiazoles (I) were prepared by the Hantzsch method from thioamides and β-bromo-β-ketoacids, and the oxazoles (II) were prepared by the procedure of Davidson3."
https://openalex.org/W1568876490,"Long chain fatty acids at concentrations inhibiting mitochondrial respiration were, in the presence of serum albumin, found to produce almost as high a rate of oxygen uptake as alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, or acetate. This oxidation was characterized in terms of its coupling to phosphorylation, need for cofactors, and production of different metabolites during the reactions. Fatty acids were oxidized to carbon dioxide, acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and other water-soluble metabolites, tentatively identified as intermediates of the citric acid cycle. An agent to spark the citric acid cycle and adenosine tri- or monophosphate were necessary for optimal oxidation rate, as described for other fatty acid oxidation systems. Balance experiments with different amounts of malate were performed with incubations lasting as long as oxygen uptake took place. In the presence of 1 mumole of malate, practically all added palmitic acid was used up and found to be converted primarily to carbon dioxide, acetoacetate, and other water-soluble metabolites of which the major part was tentatively identified as succinate. A significant portion was found in mitochondrial phospholipids. With 10 mumoles of malate some palmitic acid remained in the system, while a comparatively small amount was converted to carbon dioxide, and a major part was found as succinate. Here also incorporation into phospholipids occurred. With no malate added, fatty acid oxidation was much smaller than with malate, although significant conversion to carbon dioxide took place. Only a little succinate and phospholipid were found. Oxygen uptake was greater than a theoretical value calculated from radioactive balance experiments. It was concluded that albumin contains oxidizable material even after extraction and dialysis. Albumin at high concentrations inhibited both fatty acid and alpha-ketoglutarate oxidation. The oxidation of long chain fatty acids in high concentrations in the form of albumin-fatty acid complex was coupled to phosphorylation. Thus P:O ratios above 2 were found as well as evidence for respiratory control. It was concluded that oxidation of long chain fatty acids by isolated mitochondria occurs from their albumin complex. This process can also be studied at high concentrations of fatty acids, where high rates of oxygen uptake are obtained from oxidation which is coupled to phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1979455009,"The survival of Escherichia coli B/r WP2 (tryptophan-requiring) from ultraviolet irradiation when suspended in 0.067M phosphate buffer (pH 7) has been studied over the temperature range 22 degrees to -269 degrees C. In unfrozen suspensions there was no appreciable change in sensitivity between 22 degrees and -10 degrees C. The sensitivity in the presence of ice progressively increased by a factor of 7 when the temperature was lowered to -79 degrees C. Between -79 degrees and -196 degrees C the sensitivity decreased to less than four times the sensitivity at 22 degrees C and was not appreciably different at -269 degrees C. Evidence from experiments with bacteriophage T1 and E. coli WP2 HCR(-) (a strain unable to excise thymine dimers) indicates that a new, qualitatively different lesion, less amenable to repair, may replace the thymine dimer in E. coli irradiated at -79 degrees C."

https://openalex.org/W1499096332,"Abstract Polynucleotide phosphorylase of Micrococcus luteus catalyzes the addition of a single dAMP moiety from dADP onto an oligoribonucleotide. Further addition of either dAMP or AMP residues to the resulting (Ap)ndA is very difficult. The chain elongation reaction proceeds faster in the presence of Mn2+ than in the presence of Mg2+. The enzyme also catalyzes an exchange between the β-phosphate of dADP and 32Pi, but only in the presence of either an oligoribonucleotide bearing an unesterified C-3'-hydroxyl group or of ADP. Similar results are obtained with Form I (primer-independent) and Form T (primer-dependent) enzyme. It appears that 32Pi-dADP exchange occurs by the addition of a dAMP residue to the end of a polyribonucleotide (or oligoribonucleotide) chain and the subsequent phosphorolysis of the internucleotide bond. Furthermore, no evidence for the formation of a dAMP-enzyme complex could be obtained. Incubation of the enzyme with dADP as the sole substrate results, rather, in the formation of a limited amount of (dA)n. This reaction also proceeds more readily in the presence of Mn2+ than in Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1513531045,"Abstract When acetaldehyde and ammonium ion are incubated with ethanolamine ammonia-lyase and coenzyme B12, two processes occur: (a) transfer of hydrogen from the C-5' of the coenzyme to acetaldehyde and (b) dissociation of the coenzyme at the carbon-cobalt bond with the formation of 5'-deoxyadenosine and enzyme-bound hydroxocobalamin. When NH4+ is omitted, no tritium transfer to acetaldehyde occurs, but the dissociation of the carbon-cobalt bond is accelerated. From the results it was concluded that 1-aminoethanol is an intermediate in the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1485686731,"Abstract Proton magnetic resonance and ultraviolet spectroscopic data have shown that the coordination of thiamine and thiamine pyrophosphate with indolyl compounds centers upon the positively charged quaternary nitrogen atom of the thiamine moiety and the benzene ring of the indole moiety. In ultraviolet studies a marked increase in absorbance over the sum of the absorbances of the individual solutions was found when a solution of a thiazolium derivative was mixed with that of an indolyl compound, whereas no interaction was indicated between the indolyl compounds and uncharged thiazole compounds. The proton magnetic resonance signals which show the greatest effect of the interaction are those of the protons which surround the quaternary nitrogen atom of thiamine and those of the protons attached to the benzene ring of the indolyl compounds. The signal of the bridge methylene protons of thiamine in the pure 1:1 complex with indoleacetate appears approximately 2.5 ppm upfield from the signal of the bridge methylene protons of free thiamine. From the magnitude of this change in chemical shift, the distance between the apex of the complexed thiamine molecule and the plane of the indole ring can be estimated as 0.37 nm. This small separation and the relative magnitude of the changes in chemical shift of the various thiamine signals suggest that the average conformation of thiamine in the complex has a large (g90°) inter-ring dihedral angle. Such a conformation places the pyrimidine amino group close to the thiazolium proton."

An analogy is made to appearance of high factor VIII activity after plasma transfusions in von Willebrand's disease.
https://openalex.org/W1493672335,"Abstract Methylitaconate (MeIT) is identified as the intermediate in the conversion of α-methyleneglutarate (αMG) to dimethylamaleate (DMM). α-Methyleneglutarate mutase catalyzes the B12 coenzyme-dependent conversion of α-methyleneglutarate to methylitaconate. Analogous to other B12-dependent reactions the coenzyme serves in this process as a carrier of the hydrogen that is abstracted from αMG and replaced by the acrylyl moiety of αMG through an intramolecular rearrangement. That carbon 5' of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl moiety covalently bonded to the cobalt is the specific site on the B12 coenzyme involved in the hydrogen carrying function was shown by (a) incorporation of tritium from [5'-3H]dimethylbenzimidazolycobamide coenzyme (DMBC) into both the substrate and the product of αMG mutase and (b) transfer of tritium from 2-amino[1-3H]-ethanol to MeIT and αMG in a coupled system containing αMG mutase, unlabeled B12 coenzyme, and ethanolamine deaminase, an enzyme known to transfer tritium to the 5'-methylene group of the coenzyme from 2-amino[1-3H]ethanol. Interaction of labeled B12 coenzyme with the two purified enzymes in the coupled reaction and proportionality of tritium recovery in products to amount of [5'-3H]DMBC added indicates a dissociable enzyme-coenzyme complex or a transfer of tritium between enzyme-bound and free coenzyme. The tritium transferred from [3H]DMBC to αMG is incorporated into one (or both) of the methylene carbons of the 5-carbon chain of the molecule and none is present in the α-methylene group. The solvent, water, does not appear to participate in the hydrogen transfer reaction catalyzed by αMG mutase. The second isomerization involving the migration of the double bond of methylitaconate to form dimethylmaleate is catalyzed by a sulfhydryl enzyme, methylitaconate isomerase. Using 3H2O and 2H2O, proton exchange with the solvent during this reaction was demonstrated. A hydrogen on position 3 of MeIT and in the reverse direction on a methyl group of DMM exchanges with the solvent."
https://openalex.org/W1523693024,"Abstract Complex formation between thiamine or thiamine pyrophosphate and various indolyl compounds has been studied by observing changes in the nuclear magnetic resonance and ultraviolet spectra of solutions of the complex-forming pairs. The 1:1 stoichiometry of each of the complexes was shown by the linearity of double reciprocal plots relating change in chemical shift or in ultraviolet absorbance and concentration of either of the components. The values of apparent association constant for all of the complexes obtained from such double reciprocal plots, and the values of ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS calculated for the indoleacetate-thiamine complex are typical for weak complexes in solution. The predominant mode of association of the indolyl-thiamine complexes seems to be the π-electron donor-acceptor interaction. This conclusion was based on the following observations: (a) the magnitude of the association constants is decreased by increased ionic strength, (b) there is little difference among the association constants for a series of complexes in which only the net charge of each indolyl compound was different (+, 0, -), (c) the association constants for the complexes involving 5-methoxyindoleacetate and 5-hydroxytryptophan, in which the donor capacity of the indole ring is enhanced by the electronsupplying substituents, are significantly greater than those for all of the other complexes."

The enzyme has been purified 400-fold, and was stabilized by dithiothreitol and glycerol. Evidence that a single enzyme cleaves both ribonucleosides and deoxynucleosides was obtained from gel electrophoresis, heat inactivation studies, and kinetic experiments. The relative Vmax values (at pH 7.4) for the nucleosides tested were: uridine, 1.0; 5-bromodeoxyuridine, 0.75; 5-bromouridine, 0.40; 5-methyluridine, 0.27; thymidine, 0.21; and deoxyuridine, 0.12.

https://openalex.org/W1663318878,"Abstract dADP inhibits de novo polymerization of ADP by polynucleotide phosphorylase (primer-independent, Form I, and primer-dependent, Form T, enzyme). Inhibition occurs at concentrations of dADP 2 orders of magnitude lower than the ADP concentration. Adenosine methylene diphosphonate, another analogue of ADP, does not inhibit polymerization of ADP at comparable concentrations. Although de novo polymerization is very sensitive to low concentrations of dADP, the addition of nucleoside monophosphate units to oligonucleotide primers is only inhibited at high concentrations of dADP. Thus oligonucleotides appear to relieve the inhibition. When Mg2+ is replaced by Mn2+, the sensitivity of the enzyme to dADP is markedly reduced. These results are interpreted to indicate that dADP specifically inhibits chain by interaction with enzyme at an initiation site. Values of the association constants for formation of complexes between Mg2+ and Mn2+ with dADP and adenosine methylene diphosphonate are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1668590966,"Abstract Copolymers containing AMP and dAMP residues have been synthesized with polynucleotide phosphorylase from Micrococcus luteus. The rate of copolymerization depends upon the input ratio of ADP to dADP. It also depends, in a nonlinear way, upon enzyme concentration. Copolymerization proceeds most readily when Mn2+ replaces Mg2+ and preparation of polymers in Mn2+ therefore permits incorporation of a higher proportion of dAMP residues into copolymer. In the presence of either cation, the ratio of AMP to dAMP residues in copolymer is always higher than the ratio of ADP to dADP in the substrate mixture. The size of the copolymer poly (rAn,dAm) is quite large and identical to that of the homopolymer, polyA. Polymers synthesized in Mn2+ are more heterogenous in size than polymers synthesized in Mg2+. The Discussion includes a general discussion of the effect of Mn2+ on reactions catalyzed by M. luteus polynucleotide phosphorylase."

No change in the Km for glucose-6-P is obtained. To further understand the mode by which insulin regulates hepatic glycogen synthesis, we have examined the effect of cellular anions on the enzymes from control and insulin-treated animals. Using citrate as a model compound for these cellular anions, we have shown in this paper that the major effects of citrate on glycogen synthetase are (a) higher affinity for glucose-6-P for the insulin-activated enzyme, (b) higher affinity for fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which acts as a glucose-6-P analogue, (c) the Km for UDP-glucose becomes independent of glucose-6-P, (d) changes in activation energy, and (e) changes in sedimentation behavior. These changes in the properties of the insulin-activated enzyme make it possible for the enzyme to function optimally under normal physiological concentrations of glucose-6-P."
