https://openalex.org/W2071921882,"When human skin was exposed to simulated solar ultraviolet radiation, epidermal 7-dehydrocholesterol was converted to previtamin D3. During prolonged exposure to simulated solar ultraviolet radiation, the synthesis of previtamin D3 reached a plateau at about 10 to 15 percent of the original 7-dehydrocholesterol content, and previtamin D3 was photoisomerized to two biologically inert isomers, lumisterol3 and tachysterol3. Increases either in skin melanin concentration or in latitude necessitated increases in the exposure time to simulated solar ultraviolet radiation required to maximize the formation, but not the total content, of previtamin D3. In order of importance, the significant determinants limiting the cutaneous production of previtamin D3 are (i) photochemical regulation, (ii) pigmentation, and (iii) latitude."

The resulting clones of the A-MuLV genome show homology to the ends of Moloney MuLV and to a 3.5 kb central region containing sequences unique to Abelson virus. A 2.3 kb restriction fragment containing only A-MuLV-specific sequences was subcloned in the plasmid vector pBR322 and used as a probe for the cellular gene that had been acquired by the virus. DNA from all inbred mouse lines examined contains an identical region of homology spread out over 11 to 20 kb. The cellular gene contains intervening sequences which are lacking in the viral genome. Rat, Chinese hamster, rabbit, chicken and human DNA also show homology to the viral probe."

https://openalex.org/W2019420909,"Rat hepatoma cells which secrete several serum proteins have been infected with a temperature sensitive mutant of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, which is defective in RNA replication and transcription. These infected cells, grown at 39.5°C, continue normal secretion of albumin and transferrin, so that synthesis and maturation of secretory and membrane proteins, including the VSV G protein, can be studied in the same cells. Serum proteins are not secreted from the cells at the same rate; half of the newly synthesized albumin appears in the medium after 23 minutes, while half of the glycoprotein transferrin is secreted only after about 40 minutes. By contrast, two membrane proteins—the VSV G glycoprotein and a high molecular weight hepatoma surface protein—are detected at the cell surface approximately 23 minutes after their synthesis. The differences in the rate of externalization among the secretory and membrane glycoproteins are due to differences in the rate of transport from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into or through the Golgi region, as judged by the time required for maturation of the asn-linked oligosaccharides. Unglycosylated VSV G does not reach the cell surface, while unglycosylated transferrin is secreted at the same rate as the glycosylated species. Thus neither the synthesis nor the presence of the asn-linked oligosaccharide chain are determinants in the rate of transferrin secretion. The monovalent ionophore monensin inhibits both secretion of serum proteins and migration of membrane proteins to the cell surface. However, the intracellular transport of transferrin is blocked in a stage where the molecule is still sensitive to endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, while VSV G reaches a stage in which it is resistant to the enzyme. These results indicate that at least part of the intracellular pathway may be different for membrane and secretory proteins and glycoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W2027722451,"Fujinami sarcoma virus (FSV), a newly characterized avian sarcoma virus, produces a protein of 140,000 daltons (p140) in infected cells. p140 is the product of a fused gene consisting of a part of the gag gene of avian retrovirus and FSV-unique sequences which are not related to the src sequences of Rous sarcoma virus. In vivo, p140 was found to be phosphorylated at both serine and tyrosine residues. Immunoprecipitates of p140 with antiserum against gag gene-coded proteins had a cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase activity which phosphorylated p140 itself, rabbit IgG of the immune complex and alpha-casein, an externally added soluble protein substrate. The phosphorylation was specific to tyrosine of the substrate proteins. p140 was phosphorylated in vitro at the same two tyrosine residues that were phosphorylated in vivo. The phosphate transferred to tyrosine residues of p140 forms a stable bond: it does not turn over during the kinase reaction, and the 32P-phosphate of p140 labeled in vitro or in vivo is not transferred to alpha-casein. FSV-p140 differs from p60src, the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus, in its marked preference of Mn2+ to Mg2+ ions, and in its inability to use GTP instead of ATP as the donor of gamma-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1679417272,"Protein I, a specific neuronal phosphoprotein, has previously been shown, using rat brain synaptosome preparations, to contain multiple sites of phosphorylation which were differentially regulated by cAMP and calcium. In the present study, Protein I was purified to homogeneity from rat brain and its phosphorylation was investigated using homogeneous cAMP-dependent protein kinase and a partially purified calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase from rat brain. Employing various peptide mapping techniques, a minimum of three phosphorylation sites could be distinguished in Protein I; the phosphorylated amino acid of each site was serine. One phosphorylation site was located in the collagenase-resistant portion of Protein I and was the principal target for phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This site was also phosphorylated by calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. The other two phosphorylation sites were located in the collagenase-sensitive portion of Protein I. These latter sites were markedly phosphorylated by calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, but not by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in concentrations sufficient to phosphorylate maximally the site in the collagenase-resistant portion. Thus, the phosphorylation of purified Protein I by purified cAMP-dependent and calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases provides an enzymological explanation for the regulation of phosphorylation of endogenous Protein I in synaptosome preparations by cAMP and by calcium observed previously. The studies suggest that certain of the synaptic actions of two distinct second messengers, cAMP and calcium, are expressed through the distinct specificities of cAMP- and calcium-dependent protein kinases for the multiple phosphorylation sites in one neuron-specific protein, Protein I."

https://openalex.org/W1531883069,"A low molecular weight peptide (speract) associated with sea urchin eggs has been purified to apparent homogeneity by charcoal adsorption, DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, Bio-Gel P-2 filtration, and Dowex AG 50W-X4 chromatography. Gametes from 5000 female sea urchins were required for the isolation of approximately 9 mg of the peptide. The isolated peptide is homogenous based on [3H]acetic anhydride labeling, gel filtration, and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Speract is composed entirely of neutral and acidic amino acids with glycine as the major component, and it appears to have a blocked NH2 terminus based on its insensitivity to leucine aminopeptidase, its failure to react with dansyl chloride, and its chromatographic behavior on strong cation exchange resins. Speract is a potent stimulator of sea urchin sperm oxygen consumption, causing significant increases of sperm respiration rates at concentrations as low as 10(-12) M and producing 20-fold increases of oxygen consumption at maximal concentrations of 10(-8) M. Sperm cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP concentrations are also increased by speract, but concentrations of at least 10(-10) M and 10(-9) M are required for half-maximal elevations, respectively. The peptide, purified from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus eggs, also cross-reacts with spermatozoa from Lytechnis pictus sea urchins, suggesting that speract does not show species specificity. These results represent the first report of the purification of a peptide associated with eggs that may affect spermatozoa under natural conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1975611863,"Cells infected by one strain of Fujinami sarcoma virus (FSV) are transformed at 38°C but are phenotypically normal at 41.5°C. FSV encodes a 140,000 molecular weight protein (P140) with gag gene-related and FSV-specific peptide sequences. At 41.5°C, P140 is weakly phosphorylated at serine residues, and is inactive in the immune complex protein kinase assay. At 38°C, P140 is highly phosphorylated, contains phosphotyrosine in addition to phosphoserine, and in the immune complex kinase assay becomes phosphorylated at three tyrosine residues. Phosphorylation of cellular polypeptides at tyrosine residues in FSV-infected cells is also temperature-sensitive. These observations indicate that P140 is the transforming protein of FSV and that protein phosphorylation at tyrosine residues is involved in transformation by this virus."
https://openalex.org/W2029447197,"Specific initiation of transcription of Rous sarcoma virus by RNA polymerase II was obtained in a cell-free system using cloned RSV DNA as template. The site of initiation is located in the common ""C"" region of the long terminal repeat (LTR), 23 bp downstream from the promoter-like sequence TATTTAAG. This finding indicates that the basic information necessary for RSV transcription lies within the viral genome."

https://openalex.org/W1578930361,"The turnover of plasma membrane proteins in primary rat hepatocyte cultures was examined by following the loss of polypeptides labeled in situ by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination using 125I and 131I. Most plasma membrane proteins had similar rates of degradation, having a half-life of approximately 85 h. By in situ labeling via lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, as well as metabolically labeling cells with L-[35S]methionine, the asialoglycoprotein receptor, a plasma membrane constituent, was identified and shown to exist in three forms which were structurally related. The turnover of receptor on the cell surface was examined by following the loss of iodinated cell surface receptor, while the turnover of total cellular receptor, including both surface and internally localized receptor was assayed by following the loss of receptor labeled metabolically with [35S]methionine. The turnover rate in both cases was approximately 20 h. Receptor-mediated endocytosis of asialoglycoproteins had no effect on the turnover of the plasma membrane proteins or receptor. Based on estimates of the rate of metabolism of the asialoglycoprotein ligand relative to the turnover rate of the receptor, we conclude each molecule of receptor can deliver about 1,000 molecules of ligand to the lysosome to be degraded."
https://openalex.org/W2064321483,"Metkephamid is an analog of methionine enkephalin that retains high affinity for the delta receptor and is a systemically active analgesic. Since it is at least 100 times more potent than morphine as an analgesic when placed directly into the lateral ventricles, and is 30 to 100 times more potent on the delta receptor and yet is roughly equipotent on the mu receptor in vitro, it is concluded that it probably produces analgesia by action on delta receptors as well as, or rather than, on mu receptors. It has less tendency to produce respiratory depression, tolerance, and physical dependence than standard analgesics, and it is presently undergoing clinical trial."

https://openalex.org/W1567503933,"Abstract L-3,5,3'-Triiodothyronine (T3) has been shown to influence the synthesis of myelin-associated lipids in cultures of cells dissociated from brains of embryonic mice (Bhat, N. R., Sarlieve, L., Subba Rao, G., and Pieringer, R. A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 9342-9344). This culture system was used in the present study to gain additional information on the regulation of the synthesis of myelin lipids by thyroid hormone. The rate of synthesis of the myelin associated sulfolipids remained drastically diminished throughout a 70-day developmental period when cells were grown in the presence of hypothyroid calf serum (T3 < 25 ng/100 ml; thyroxine (T4), 1.2 microgram/ml). However, the activity could be restored to normal levels after 72 h of exposure to deficient medium supplemented with exogenous T3. Half-maximal effects were obtained with 2 X 10(-9) M T3 and 6.25 X 10(-7) M T4. T3 does not alter the synthesis of sulfated mucopolysaccharides, which share adenosine 3'-phosphate, 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), as a common precursor, with sulfolipids. This observation argues against the hormone altering the entry of sulfate or the synthesis of PAPS. Rather, T3 acts by changing the activity of the glycolipid:PAPS sulfotransferase(s) in direct proportion to the concentration of T3 in the growth medium. The activity of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase, another myelin marker was also found to be T3 dependent. The response of sulfolipid synthesis to varying amounts of T3 was also observed in a serum-free medium, which suggests that T3 can function independently of other hormones and serum factors in exerting a relatively specific effect on the regulation of myelination."

https://openalex.org/W1577321081,"A new technique capable of determining the static and dynamic structures of heme protein crystals is reported. It is shown that microcrystals of a variety of paramagnetic heme proteins, suspended in approximately 90% saturated (NH4)2SO4, may be perfectly aligned by an intense static external magnetic field, H0, due to the large anisotropy in the magnetic susceptibility of the protein caused by the paramagnetic center. Myoglobin from sperm whale (Physeter catodon) was isotopically enriched at the C epsilon methyl groups of methionine residues 55 and 131 with either 13C or 2H and studied in the crystalline solid state by 2H-quadrupole echo and 13C-Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It was found that suspensions of both high (S = 5/2) and low (S = 1/2) spin ferric forms of the labeled protein were ordered, the axis of ordering being approximately perpendicular to the low temperature minimum g tensor valve, even though upper Kramers levels are populated at room temperature. The paramagnetic CoII derivative coboglobin showed similar ordering behavior, but the diamagnetic carboxymyoglobin was unaffected. The magnetic ordering method permits the recording of NMR spectra from microcrystalline arrays of proteins which cannot be prepared in large enough form (approximately 1 cm3) for single crystal NMR spectroscopy and thereby allows the resolution and assignment of numerous single atom sites in the crystalline solid state. The information from a NMR spectrum combined with that obtained on the crystal powder allows for the direct determination of (i) the spatial orientation of the particular labeled residue within the protein crystal and (ii) the rates and types of side chain motion. Resonances were assigned by spin label broadening experiments and by use of existing x-ray data to predict 2H-NMR spectra. This new technique opens up the possibility of determining directly the dynamic structure of protein crystals and of comparing the structures of proteins in the crystalline solid state with that in solution and is applicable to other heme proteins, e.g. catalase."
https://openalex.org/W2068049261,"In chickens the erythroid differentiation proceeds from stem cells to erythrocytes through several intermediate steps which have been identified in vivo and in vitro. To determine whether Avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) is able to transform in vitro either one or several types of these precursors, bone marrow cells were separated by physical and immunological methods. It was found that the target cells which could be transformed in vitro by AEV were cells of light density (1.060-1.065 g/cm3), having a modal sedimentation velocity at unit gravity between 4.0 and 6.0 mm/hr, expressing an immature antigen at a low level and a brain-related antigen at a high level. These results indicated that the target cells of neoplastic transformation by AEV were early erythroid precursors, since these precursors shared the same physical and immunological properties with AEV target cells."

https://openalex.org/W1575806031,"A cell surface-localized glycoprotein that exhibits alkaline phosphatase activity was induced by treatment of mouse L-cell cultures with dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Treatment of cells with 1.5 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP for a period of 7 days resulted in a approximately 2000-fold increase in the specific activity of the enzyme. Enzyme induction was dependent upon de novo RNA and protein biosynthesis since this induction was completely suppressed when actinomycin D (0.5 microgram/ml) or cycloheximide (5 microgram/ml) was administered with dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Further, the overall rates of incorporation of either [3H]glucosamine or [3H]leucine into macromolecules were identical in the presence or absence of dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Alkaline phosphatase was immunotitrated in 0.5% Triton X-100-solubilized cell extracts with antisera prepared against purified native enzyme and the results indicated that dibutyryl cyclic AMP stimulated that de novo synthesis of the enzyme. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of specifically immunoprecipitated protein from cells incubated with either [35S]methionine or [6-3H]glucosamine demonstrated that dibutyryl cyclic AMP induced a 76,000-dalton glycoprotein that was characterized as alkaline phosphatase by its identity with native alkaline phosphatase that had been labeled with 32P in its active site. Electrophoretic analysis of specifically immunoprecipitated translation products from an in vitro protein-synthesizing system supplemented with L-cell RNA isolated from uninduced and cAMP-induced cells indicated that dibutyryl cyclic AMP induced the production of alkaline phosphatase-specific mRNA. These results suggest that dibutyryl cyclic AMP directly or indirectly influences the regulation of transcription of the alkaline phosphatase gene in L-cells."

https://openalex.org/W2013524453,"Inosine, 2-deoxyinosine, and 2-deoxyguanosine completely reversed the increase in exploratory activity elicited in mice by diazepam. The inhibition of exploratory behavior by purines occurred at doses that when given alone have no effect on exploratory behavior. 7-Methylinosine, which does not bind to the brain benzodiazepine binding site in vitro, had no effect on the diazepam-induced increase in exploratory behavior. Behavioral effects produced by various combinations of inosine and diazepam indicate that the interaction between purine and benzodiazepine is antagonistic and support the hypothesis that the naturally occurring purines function in anxiety-related behaviors that respond to benzodiazepine treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1504245933,"The ability of several chemically modified forms of glucagon to activate adenylate cyclase have been compared with their ability to displace 125I-glucagon from specific membrane binding sites. The results demonstrate that both NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal portions of the peptide, as well as the central region of the glucagon molecule, are all involved in receptor binding and subsequent activation of adenylate cyclase. Receptor binding was very sensitive to chemical modification of the polar residues of glucagon. For example, conversion of the sole lysine residue of glucagon to homoarginine resulted in over a 2-fold loss in receptor-binding affinity. Loss in ability to activate adenylate cyclase was at least as great as loss in receptor binding for all of the derivatives. In the case of derivatives modified at the COOH terminus, the loss in ability to activate adenylate cyclase correlated well with loss in receptor binding. In general, however, the loss of the ability to activate adenylate cyclase was greater than the loss in binding affinity. This difference was greatest for the derivative N alpha-trinitrophenyl glucagon where the loss in adenylate cyclase activation was about 100-fold greater than the loss in receptor binding. This derivative behaved as an antagonist to glucagon in the activation of adenylate cyclase."

https://openalex.org/W2049726650,"The state and organization of viral DNA sequences present in independently isolated rat cell lines transformed with SV40 were investigated using restriction-enzyme cleavage of the cellular DNA and blot hybridization with a viral probe. The transformed lines were established under conditions as identical as possible, except for a limited number of variables (multiplicity of infection, physiological state of the cells after infection and procedures used for selecting the transformed derivatives). They were characterized after a limited number of generations in culture. Two distinct types of organization were found: covalently integrated viral genomes were present either as single inserts or as head-to-tail oligomeric structures. The latter was observed among transformants derived from cells maintained after infection under growth-inhibiting conditions (suspension in agarose medium, confluency on a solid substrate). Single inserts were observed only among cell lines isolated after an initial period of active growth. Recurrent patterns of hybridizaton were observed in independently isolated lines, indicating that the sites of the integrative recombinations were close enough, both in the viral and the cellular sequences, not to be distinguished at the level of sensitivity of the technique (more than +/- 100 bp). Among cell lines with multiple integration sites, only part of the inserts were found in several instances to be identical to inserts observed in other transformed lines."
https://openalex.org/W1483530708,"The ovalbumin gene in chick oviduct nuclei or nucleosomes is digested preferentially by either DNase I or staphylococcal nuclease. Staphylococcal nuclease preferentially cuts between and within core particles of the oviduct ovalbumin gene; thus, the ovalbumin gene is more quickly degraded to mononucleosomes and the DNA within these monomers is digested to a nonhybridizable size significantly faster than the chicken globin gene. Mono- and oligonucleosomes generated by partial staphylococcal nuclease digestion at 0 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C, retain equal sensitivity to DNase I. Most of this sensitivity persists when histone H1 and most of the non-histone chromosomal proteins are removed with 0.6 M NaCl. On the basis of these observations, we propose that nuclease sensitivity of the oviduct ovalbumin gene is due to covalent modifications of the core histones and that this sensitivity is amplified by interaction of other chromosomal proteins with these modified histones."
https://openalex.org/W1591824505,"Bovine lung cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase was covalently labeled with the ATP analog, 5-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine. The inactivation reaction was pseudo-first order. The rate of kinase sulfonation exhibited saturation kinetics indicative of a rapid reversible binding of the reagent prior to enzyme modification. The enzyme could be protected by MgATP, MgADP, and Mg-adenylylimidodiphosphate but not by a synthetic peptide substrate. Cyclic GMP when bound to the kinase did not influence the rate of labeling. The reagent demonstrated competitive inhibition with respect to MgATP; the Ki was found to be 0.82 mM. Magnesium and cobalt ions when included in the reaction mixture accelerated the inactivation rate up to severalfold. Addition of basic polypeptides such as mixed histone, protamine sulfate, or poly-L-lysine HBr also markedly accelerated the sulfonation rate. Inactivation of the kinase with 5-'fluorosulfonyl[3H]benzoyladenosine resulted in a linear relationship between the residual phosphotransferase activity and the incorporation of up to 0.9 mol of reagent/mol of monomer."

https://openalex.org/W2023881218,"We report here a study of the mechanisms leading to loss of growth control in chicken embryo fibroblasts transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). We have been particularly concerned with the role of the src gene in this process, and have used RSV mutants temperature sensitive (ts) for transformation to investigate the nature of the growth regulatory lesion. The two principal findings were (1) the stationary phase of the cell cycle (G1) in chick embryo fibroblasts seems to have two distinct regulatory compartments (using the terminology of Brooks et al. we refer to these as 'Q' and 'A' states). When rendered stationary at 41.5 degrees C by serum deprivation, normal cells enter a Q state, but cells infected with the ts-mutant occupy an A state. (2) Whereas normal cells can occupy either state depending on culture conditions, the ts-infected cells, at 41.5 degrees C, do not seem to enter Q even though a known src gene product, a kinase, is reported to be inactive at this temperature. We discuss the possibility that viral factors other than the active src protein kinase influence growth control in infected cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1580852787,"We have measured the increase in 18O content of water produced from single turnover oxidations of anerobically reduced cytochrome c oxidase with 18O2 in order to test the hypothesis that a reduced atom of oxygen, originating from dioxygen, remains bound to oxidized cytochrome c oxidase in the form of a mu-oxo-bridge between two metal components when a single turnover occurs. When water samples produced by oxidizing the reduced enzyme with 18O2 were compared to natural abundance control samples obtained by oxidizing with 16O2, all of the 18O2 reduced in a single turnover could be accounted for in the form of additional H218O produced. We conclude that neither atom of the dioxygen reduced is incorporated into the enzyme as a bridge which is stable in the absence of oxidoreductive reactions on the time scale of several minutes."
