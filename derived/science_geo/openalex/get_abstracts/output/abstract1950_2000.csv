https://openalex.org/W1507410890,"Low levels of calcium (100 nmol/mg) added to beef heart mitochondria induced a configurational transition from the aggregated to the orthodox state and a simultaneous uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The primary effect of calcium was to cause a nonspecific increase in the permeability of the inner membrane, resulting in entry of sucrose into the matrix space and the observed configurational transition. The uncoupling and permeability change induced by calcium could readily be reversed by lowering the calcium:magnesium ratio in the presence of either substrate or ATP. The configurational state, however, remained orthodox. This, along with studies of hypotonically induced orthodox mitochondria in which the membrane remained coupled and impermeable until after the addition of calcium, led to the conclusion that coupling was related to the permeability state of the inner membrane rather than the configurational state. Phosphate, arsenate, or oleic acid was found to cause a transition similar to that induced by calcium. Studies with the specific calcium transport inhibitors, EGTA, ruthenium red, and lanthanum revealed that endogenous calcium is required for the anion-induced transitions. A single mechanism was further indicated by a common sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide. Strontium was ineffective as an inducer of the transition, even though it is transported by the same mechanism as calcium. This indicates that there are additional calcium-binding sites responsible for triggering the transition. Magnesium and calcium appeared to compete for these additional sites, since magnesium competitively inhibited the calcium-induced transition, but had no effect on calcium uptake. Calcium was found to potently inhibit the respiration of all NAD+-requiring substrates prior to the transition. Strontium also produced this inhibition without a subsequent transition. ATPase activity was induced at the exact time of transition with calcium and was not induced by strontium. This suggests that calcium-induced ATPase uniquely required the transition for activity, in contrast to the ATPase induced by uncoupler or valinomycin. The results of this work indicate that mitochondria have a built-in mechanism which responds to low levels of calcium, phosphate, and fatty acids, resulting in simultaneous changes, including increased permeability, inducation of ATPase, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and loss of respiratory control."
https://openalex.org/W1530906216,"A procedure is presented for purifying a novel proteinase inhibitor in human plasma whose apparent unique biological property is to inhibit efficiently the lysis of fibrin clots induced by plasminogen activator. The final product is homogeneous as judged by disc gel electrophoresis, and immunoelectrophoresis. Its molecular weight estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis or sedimentation equilibrium is 67,000 and 63,000, respectively. The inhibitor is a glycoprotein consisting polypeptide chain containing 11.7% carbohyrate. It migrates in the alpha2-globulin region in immunoelectrophoresis. The inhibitor is chemically and immunologically different from all the other known inhibitors in plasma. Inhibition of plasmin by the inhibitor is almost instantaneous even at 0 degrees, in contrast to the slow inhibition of urokinase (plasminogen activator in urine). Plasminogen activation by urokinase-induced clot lysis is inhibited by the inhibitor mainly through a mechanism of instantaneous inhibition of plasmin formed and not through the inhibition of urokinase. The inhibitor also inhibits trypsin. Consequently, it is suggested that this newly identified inhibitor is named alpha2-plasmin inhibitor or alpha2-proteinase inhibitor. A specific antibody directed against the inhibitor neutralizes virtually all inhibitory activity of plasma to activator-induced clot lysis. Immunochemical quantitation of the inhibitor was specific antiserum to the inhibitor and the purified inhibitor as a standard indicates that the concentration of the inhibitory in the serum of a healthy man is in or near the range of 5 to 7 mg/100 ml, which is the lowest concentration among the concentration of the proteinase inhibitors in plasma. The inhibitor and plasmin, trypsin, or urokinase form a complex which cannot be dissociated with denaturing and reducing agents. The formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex occurs on a 1:1 molar basis and is associated with the cleavage of a unique peptide bone, which is most clearly demonstrated in the interaction of the inhibitor and beta-trypsin. In the complex formation between the inhibitor and plasmin, the inhibitor is cross-linked with the light chain which contains the active site of plasmin. It is suggested that, in a fashion analogous to complex formation between alpha1-antitrypsin and trypsin, the cross-links are formed between the active site serine of the enzyme and the newly formed COOH-terminal residue of the inhibitor, with cleavage of a peptide bond."

The regulatory proteins tropomyosin and troponin bind to filamentous actin and slow down but do not prevent the depolymerization. In the absense of ATP, heavy meromyosin binds tightly to actin filaments and blocks completely the DNAase I: actin filament interaction. Addition of ATP releases heavy meromyosin; DNAase I is then rapidly inhibited and the actin filaments are depolymerized."
https://openalex.org/W2093220261,"Loss of brain serotonin was associated with overeating and increased body weight. Rats injected with p-chlorophenylalanine intraventricularly began overeating after 3 days and continued to display marked hyperphagia, primarily in the daytime, accompanied by increased body weight for 1 to 2 weeks. The effect was related to drug dose and to the degree and duration of serotonin depletion. Norepinephrine and dopamine levels were not significantly affected. It is concluded that p-chlorophenylalanine disinhibits feeding, as it does a number of other behaviors, by depleting serotonin. This suggests that hypothalamic lesions or dietary deficiencies which selectively and sufficiently deplete serotonin would lead to overeating."
https://openalex.org/W1580360169,"Endo-beta-galactosidase was purified 4400-fold from a culture filtrate of Escherichia freundii with 45% recovery. The enzyme preparation was practically free of exoglycosidases, sulfatase, and proteases. This enzyme hydrolyzed several keratan sulfates, endoglycosidically releasing oligosaccharides of various molecular sizes. Among the digestion products of the corneal keratan sulfate, the structure of a disaccharride and a tetrasaccharride were shown to be 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-6-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucosyl-(1 leads to 3)-D-galactose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-6-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucosyl-(1 leads to 3)-6-O-sulfo-beta-D-galactosyl-(1 leads to 4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-6-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucosyl-(1 leads to 3)-D-galactose, respectively. These oligosaccharide structures indicate that this enzyme specifically hydrolyzes the galactosidic bonds in which nonsulfated galactose residues participate. The enzyme could also hydrolyze a small oligosaccharide such as lacto-N-neotetraitol as follows: Gal(beta 1 leads to 4)GlcNAc(beta 1 leads to 3)Gal(beta 1 leads to 4) sorbitol leads to Gal(beta 1 leads to 4)GlcNAc(beta 1 leads to 3)Gal + sorbitol AB active blood group substance could be hydrolyzed by this enzyme only after Smith degradation. After enzymatic digestion small oligosaccharides and resistant macromolecules were produced. These findings indicate that the enzyme should be useful in studying the precise structures of keratan sulfates, related glycoproteins, and oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1573417299,"Cytoplasmic actin has been isolated from Acanthamoeba castellanii by a new method, employing chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, that improves the yield by more than 20-fold over the previously reported method. This procedure should be particularly useful for isolating actin from cells in which it is present in relatively low concentration because the method does not depend initially on the polymerization of actin or its interaction with myosin. Systematic comparison of the properties of purified Acanthamoeba actin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin shows them to be similar in many ways: viscosity of F-actin, stoichiometry of bound nucleotide, stoichiometry of binding of muscle heavy meromyosin and myosin subfragment 1 in the absence of ATP, and ability to inhibit the KATPase activity of heavy meromyosin. The amino acid compositions of Acanthamoeba and muscle actin are also quite similar, but significant differences, especially the presence of epsilon-N-methyllysines in Acanthamoeba actin, have been confirmed. In addition to this structural difference, we find that Acanthamoeba actin is only one-third as effective as muscle actin as an activator of the MgATPase of muscle heavy meromyosin and subfragment 1. For Acanthamoeba actin, as for muscle actin, this activation exhibits hyperbolic dependence on actin concentration; i.e. the double reciprocal plot of ATPase activation versus actin concentration is linear. From these plots we find that the two actins give the same extrapolated ATPase activity at infinite actin concentration (Vmax) but differ by a factor of three in the concentration of actin needed to produce half-maximal activation (Kapp)."
https://openalex.org/W2136306316,"When human plasminogen (Glu-Pga) is activated by urokinase in the presence of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, the plasmin produced (Glu-Pma) exclusively contains a heavy chain (Glu-Ha) derived intact from the original NH2 terminus of Glu-Pga. Similar activations, utilizing a low molecular weight synthetic plasmin acylating agent, p-nitrophenyl-p-(pyridiniummethyl) benzoate, still result in a plasmin molecule with approximately 50% of the plasmin heavy chain containing the intact NH2 terminus of the original Glu-Pga. Activations performed at high levels of urokinase in the absence of any inhibitors initially produce Glu-Pma. However, the final stable plasmin, Lys-Pmb, which is obtained contains a heavy chain (Lys-Hb) which arises by plasminolysis of a small peptide from the NH2 terminus of Glu-Ha. Alternatively, Lys-Pmb can be formed in a separate series of reactions initially involving plasminolysis of Glu-Pga to yield Lys-Pgb. The peptide removed in this step is identical to the peptide removed in the Glu-Ha to Lys-Hb reaction. Next, urokinase catalyzes the conversion of Lys-Pgb to Lys-Pmb without further loss of peptide material. This latter pathway involving Lys-Pgb is probably the major pathway for human Lys-Pmb generation. These studies support a mechanism of activation of human plasminogen which involves at least two bond cleavages in Glu-Pga. However, these same studies strongly indicate that the Nh2-terminal peptide need not be released from Glu-Pga prior to plasmin formation. Further, we feel that plasmin and not urokinase catalyzes cleavage of the NH2-terminal peptide bond from Glu-Pga and the Glu-Ha heavy chain of Glu-Pma."
https://openalex.org/W1566211504,"Chick limb bud mesenchyme cells from stage 23-24 embryos were isolated and grown in culture under conditions facilitating chondrogenic development. Dissociative extraction methods were used to isolate proteoglycans from Day 8 cultures, at which time the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into these macromolecules occurred at maximal rates. The monomer (D1) fraction contained 85 to 90% of the proteoglycans originally present in the matrix of the cultures. The composition of this fraction was approximately 7 to 8% protein, 7% keratan sulfate, and 85% chondroitin sulfate. The proportions of nonsulfated, 4-sulfated, and 6-sulfated disaccharides in chondroitinase digests were about 11%, 31%, and 58%, respectively. The D1 fraction exhibited a single, polydisperse component on Sepharose 2B chromatography and in the ultracentrifuge (so = 19 S). In associative density gradients about 35% of the proteoglycans were recovered in a gel at the top of the gradient. The remainder were recovered at the bottom of the gradient in the aggregate (A1) fraction. The A1 fraction exhibited two components, aggregate (about 70% of the total) and monomer, upon Sepharose 2B chromatography and in the ultracentrifuge (so = 120 S for aggregate; 18 S for monomer). The aggregate preparation contained only one of the two link proteins (molecular weight of about 45,000) which occur in proteoglycan preparations from many hyaline cartilages."
https://openalex.org/W1574714516,Exchange of sarcoplasmic reticulum phospholipids with dipalmitoyllecithin inhibits the (Mg2+ + Ca2+)-activated ATPase activity below 40 degrees by inhibition of the decomposition of phosphoprotein intermediate. The rate of phosphoprotein formation and the steady state concentration of phosphoprotein measured by rapid kinetic techniques are affected to a lesser extent. The inhibitory effect of dipalmitoyllecithin on ATPase activity is probably related to the viscosity of the hydrocarbon region of the membrane which inhibits the conformational change leading to calcium translocation and the eventual cleavage of phosphoprotein.
https://openalex.org/W2059618194,"Two unwanted contaminants, 3,4,3',4'-tetrachloroazoxybenzene (TCAOB) and 3,4,3',4'-tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB), formed in the commercial synthesis of 3,4-dichloroaniline or of herbicides made from 3,4-dichloroaniline, were responsible for three outbreaks of acne among chemical workers. TCAOB and TCAB are approximately isosteric to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran, two well-known contaminants that cause acne. All four of these agents are potent inducers of hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity and compete for stereospecific binding sites in the hepatic cytosol, which are thought to be the receptor sites for the induction of this enzyme. Among the chlorinated azoxy and azobenzenes, the potency of a congener to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity correlates with its binding affinity for the hepatic cytosol specific binding sites and its capacity to induce acne; this relation between structure and activity parallels that observed for the chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans."
https://openalex.org/W1618664245,"A rapid mixing technique was used to investigate the effects of Ca2+ ion on the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis by sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Basic ATPase measured in the absence of Ca2+ showed an initial burst of inorganic phosphate production. Similarities in the transient state kinetic properties of basic and or Ca2+-dependent ATPase suggest that the two activities represent a single enzyme species. At low concentrations of Ca2+ (less than 10(-6) M) the time course of the partial reactions of extra ATPase appeared to fit a simple scheme in which the acid-stable, phosphorylated enzyme (E approximately P) breaks down directly to inorganic phosphate and free enzyme. A similar mechanism seemed to apply to moderate levels of ATP and high external concentrations of Ca2+ known to inhibit transport activity. In the intermediate range of Ca2+ concentrations inorganic phosphate production was resolved into two phases consisting of a fast initial rate (burst) and slow steady state. Acid-stable phosphorylated protein showed a transient decay which coincided with the appearance of the burst. This behavior is consistent with a scheme in which E approximately P breaks down to an acid-labile or noncovalent intermediate state (E-P). A slow secondary increase in phosphorylation followed the transient decay in E approximately P. This late phase of protein labeling was eliminated following pretreatment with Triton X-100, sodium oxalate, or diethyl ether which decrease or prevent the formation of a transport gradient. An analysis of the dependence of the steady state level of phosphorylation and rate of inorganic phosphate production on Ca2+ concentration indicated that the phosphorylation mechanism involves interaction of two Ca2+ ions with the enzymatic carrier. The pathway by which E approximately P breaks down, i.e. whether it goes to E + Pi or E-P, may depend on the extent to which these sites are occupied by Ca2+. The transport of Ca2+ is discussed in terms of a flip-flop mechanism in which E approximately P and E-P represent high and low affinity Ca2+ binding states occurring in separate halves of an enzyme dimer."

https://openalex.org/W1540067804,"The rate of glucose and fructose 6-phosphate phosphorylation in islet homogenates is reduced by prior fasting of the donor rats. In fed rats, the velocity of glucose phosphorylation at increasing glucose concentrations (0.1 to 100 mM) is compatible with the presence of two enzyme activities. A preferential effect of fasting upon the high Km enzyme activity can be documented either at low ATP concentration which enhances the fractional contribution of the high Km enzyme activity, or in the presence of glucose 6-phosphate, which suppresses the low Km enzyme activity. Islet phosphofructokinase activity was characterized by inhibition by citrate or high ATP concentrations, and relief from ATP inhibition by AMP. Fasting reduces the activity of phosphofructokinase without altering its sensitivity to ATP and AMP. Cyclic AMP fails to overcome the effect of fasting upon phosphofructokinase. The activity of phosphoglucoisomerase is unaffected by fasting. The fasting-induced adaptation of key glycolytic enzymes could account, in part at least, for reduced metabolism of glucose in islets from fasted rats."

If in vitro conditions are such that tropomyosin binds only slightly to F-actin, then the addition of myosin heads can induce stoichiometric binding between them. This suggests that formation of rigor bonds between actin and myosin heads may cause some change in the actin, stabilizing the appropriate binding site for tropomyosin."
https://openalex.org/W1502420309,"Sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (NaK-ATPase) was purified from nasal salt glands of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos). Enzyme of specific activity 2,000 to 2,300 mumol of Pi/mg/hour was routinely obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment of a microsomal fraction of gland homogenate in the presence of 3 mM ATP followed by pelleting of the enzyme through a sucrose density gradient. Purified NaK-ATPase was stable for over 3 months at -20 degree. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography purified NaK-ATPase was shown to contain two polypeptide chains of molecular weight 94,000 and 60,000, the smaller of which was a glycoprotein. Purified enzyme of activity 2,300 mumol of Pi/mg/hour bound 3,600 pmol of ouabain/mg of enzyme protein. Reaction with [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+ gave 7,025 pmol of acyl phosphate/mg of enzyme protein. The turnover number calculated from phosphorylation data was 5,460 min-1. Amino acid analysis of the polypeptide components of duck salt gland enzyme after separation by gel filtration chromatography in sodium dodecyl sulfate demonstrated strong compositional homology with highly purified NaK-ATPase preparations from other organs and species. The NH2-terminal amino acid of the 94,000-dalton component was glycine and of the 60,000-dalton component, alanine. With a combination of manual sequencing and automated Edman degradation, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the 94,00-dalton catalytic subunit was found to be Gly-Arg-Asn-Lys-Tyr-Glu-Thr-Thr-Ala-()-Ser-Glu."
https://openalex.org/W1575667268,"The relationship between the RNA-dependent beta-gamma ATPase in purified rho preparations and rho-mediated termination of transcription has been investigated. In a purified in vitro system, transcription from lambdagal DNA has been carried out using either ribonucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) or four ribonucleoside 5'-(beta-gamma-imino)triphosphates (NMP-P(NH)Ps) as RNA precursors. In the presence of NTPs, rho termination activity results in (a) the synthesis of rho-dependent transcripts which are of discrete size by polyacrylamide gel analysis and (b) a marked reduction by hybridization assay in RNA transcribed distal to the rho-sensitive termination site tR. In the presence of four NMP-P(NH)Ps, which are not substrates for the beta-gamma ATPase, termination by rho is completely abolished, whereas rho-independent termination occurs normally. Addition of ATP to transcription reactions containing four NMP-P(NH)Ps restores termination, ruling out the possibility that the termination activity of rho is nonspecifically inhibited by the analog preparations. We interpret our data as strongly suggesting that the RNA-dependent beta-gamma ATPase activity of rho is required for rho-mediated termination of transcription."

No fibrinolytic activity was observed in cells cultured either in the absence of DHT or presence of pharmacological concentrations of estrogen. Furthermore, an autonomous tumor derived from the Shionogi SC-115 cells produced fibrinolytic activity independent of added DHT or estrogen. These observations suggest a close correlation between fibrinolytic activity of a tumor and its ability to grow in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1594286063,"Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase from sarcoplasmic reticulum has been delipidated by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-200 column equilibrated with buffer containing cholate. The delipidated Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase had negligible adenosine triphosphatase activity, but up to 50% of the ATPase activity was restored when the delipidated enzyme was recombined with phosphilipids. It was shown with the delipidated preparation that the phosphorylation of the enzyme by either ATP or Pi was entirely dependent on phospholipids. Among the purified phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine reactivated the adenosine triphosphatase activity better than phosphatidylethanolamine. Vesicles capable of translocating Ca2+ were reconstituted from delipidated Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase and phosphatidylethanolamine, but not with phosphatidylcholine alone. We conclude that the firmly bound phospholipids which are purified together with the adenosine triphosphatase protein are not essential for the pump since they can be substituted by phosphatidylethanolamine isolated from soybeans."

https://openalex.org/W1675645737,"Late log cultures of chick embryo vertebral chondrocytes in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium with 10% fetal calf serum consume D-glucose from the culture medium at a rate of approximately 0.40 mumol per h per 10(6) cells. When the D-glucose concentration in the medium drops below 1 mumol per ml the glycogen stores are rapidly exhausted, and cell growth ceases. 35SO4(2)- is incorporated into chondroitin-6-SO4 and chondroitin-4-SO4 at linear rates of 1.2 and 0.4 nmol per h per 10(6) cells, respectively, until the D-glucose level in the medium drops below 1 mumol per ml, but there is always a slight lag in the initial appearance of chondroitin-4-SO4. Throughout the period of 35SO4 2- labeling, the amount of chondroitin-6-SO4 that is recovered in the cells exceeds the amount that is recovered in the medium, but the opposite is true for chondroitin-4-SO4. However, when cells prelabeled with 35SO4(2-) are then transferred to a label-free medium, the secretion of chondroitin sulfates proceeds at much slower rates, and the kinetics of chondroitin-6-SO4 and chondroitin-4-SO4 secretion are very similar. In this chase experiment the chondroitin sulfates are recovered quantitatively after a 24-h incubation period, indicating that these embryonic chondrocytes do not degrade the chondroitin sulfates under these culture conditions. The rate of incorporation of counts from D-[14C]glucosamine into mucopolysaccharides and glycoproteins increase with time. This nonlinear rate results from a progressive increase in the specific activity of the UDP-N-acetyl-D-[14C]hexosamine pool as the D-glucose in the culture medium is depleted. A linear relationship is demonstrated between the logarithm of the 14C counts per min per nmol of UDP-N-acetylhexosamine and the logarithm of the concentration of D-glucose in the culture medium over a range of 1 to 20 mumol of D-glucose per ml. The relative rates of appearance of counts from 35SO4(2-) and D-[14]glucosamine in chondroitin 4-SO4 and chondroitin-6-SO4 are used to calculate the specific activity of the UDP-N-acetyl-D-[14C]hexosamine pool at each stage in the labeling period. The resulting values are then used to calculate the rates of synthesis of the nonsulfated polymers, namely, chondroitin, hyaluronic acid, and glycoprotein."

The 55,000- and 20,000-dalton fragments have ionophore activity inhibited by ruthenium red and by mercuric chloride but not by methylmercuric chloride, an inhibitor of the hydrolytic site of the enzyme. Under standard conditions the 45,000-dalton fragment was not active as an ionophore, while the 30,000-dalton fragment acted as a nonselective ionophore. The 55,000- and 30,000-dalton fragments have been shown to contain the site of phosphorylation and of N-ethyl [2-3H]-maleimide binding indicative of the hydrolytic site in the enzyme, and this site is absent from the 20,000-dalton fragment. Therefore, the ionophoric and hydrolytic sites are localized in separate regions of the ATPase molecule and they have now been physically separated. The 20,000-dalton fragment was degraded with cyanogen bromide and fragments were separated by molecular sieving. Ionophore activity was found in fragments of molecular mass less than 2,000 daltons."

This light (B) chain derivative was found to be relatively homogeneous by electrophoretic analysis in both an acrylamide gel/dodecyl sulfate system and on cellulose acetate. It possessed approximately 3% of the proteolytic activity (casein substrate) of the original enzyme, and it incorporated 0.09 mol of [3H]diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate per mol of protein. It contained 3.1 +/- 0.3 carboxymethylated cysteines per mol of protein and can be designated as a CmCys5-light (B) chain (CmCys)3. When this isolated light (B) chain derivative was mixed in equal molar amounts with streptokinase, the mixture developed both human and bovine plasminogen activator activities; the bovine activator activity was approximately 66% of the bovine activator activity of the equimolar human plasmin-streptokinase complex. Although this complex now incorporated 0.50 mol of [3H]diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate per mol of protein, its proteolytic activity, on a molar basis, was the same as the proteolytic activity of the isolated light (B) chain derivative. It was shown by electrophoretic analysis in both an acrylamide gel/epsilon-aminocaproic acid system and on cellulose acetate that the light (B) chain derivative and streptokinase forms an equimolar light (B) chain-streptokinase complex, indicating that the binding site for streptokinase is located on the light (B) chain of the enzyme. A functionally active equimolar light (B) chain-streptokinase complex was also isolated from a partially reduced and alkylated equimolar human plasmin-streptokinase complex by the affinity chromatography method. The plasminogen activator activities (human and bovine) of this light (B) chain-streptokinase complex were similar to those of the plasmin-streptokinase complex from which it was derived. Although this complex incorporated 0.70 mol of [3H]diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate per mol of protein, its proteolytic activity, on a molar basis, was only 14% of proteolytic activity of the plasmin-streptokinase complex."

Although each of the two zymogen forms contains two affinity chromatography forms, the relative concentrattions of these forms in each of the zymogen preparations depended upon the plasma sample or enriched plasma fraction used for the preparation of the zymogen. Specific analytical acrylamide gel electrophoretic systems were used for the characterization of the zymogen and enzyme forms, and their component affinity chromatography forms, 1 and 2. The four zymogen affinity chromatography forms, Glu-1-plasminogen, Glu-2-plasminogen, Lys-1-plasminogen, and Lys-2-plasmingoen, show distinct stepwise differences in their molecular size and charge.

Although the sialic acid contents of the Glu- and Lys- forms appear to be similar, the isolated affinity chromatography forms show distinct differences. The sialic acid contents of the Glu-1- and Lys-1- forms are identical, and are substantially higher than the sialic acid contents of the Glu-2- and Lys-2- forms which are also identical to each other. It is possible that the charge difference between the zymogen-1- and -2- forms may be related to the differences in their sialic acid content. Each of the four zymogen affinity chromatography forms, when activated by urokinase in the presence of the plasmin inhibitor, Trasylol, was converted to an apparently unique and different enzyme form. The four enzyme forms show distinct stepwise differences in molecular size; Glu-1-plasmin is the largest in size whereas Lys-2-plasmin is the smallest in size. Each plasmin-derived carboxymethyl heavy(A) chain was found to be different in molecular size, but the two carboxymethyl light(B) chains found in each of the four enzyme forms appeared to be identical and of the same molecular sizes.

The first 3 residues in the amino acid sequence of Neurospora H3 histone are identical to the first 3 residues in calf and pea H3; Neurospora H1, H2A, and H4 histones have blocked NH2 termini, like their mammalian counterparts. The finding of recognizable H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones in Neurospora extends the range of eukaryotes now shown to contain a full complement of these strongly conserved chromosomal proteins, and supports the view that histones became involved in chromosome structure at a very early point in the evolution of eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W1490978562,"A new ATPase electrophoretically and immunologically distinct from the dynein ATPase studied previously has been solublized and purified from sea urchin sperm flagella. This ATPase has properties similar to those of dynein ATPase. Therefore, we propose that the two ATPases be considered as dynein isoenzymes, with previously studied dynein being known as dynein 1, and the newly discovered ATPase as dynein 2. Some physicochemical and enzymatic properties of dynein 2 have been determined. The molecular weight calculated from the sedimentation coefficient (12.3 /- 1 S) and Stokes radius (12.8 /- 0.4 nm) is 690,000 +/- 70,000. The molecular weight of the high molecular weight subunit of dynein 2 has been determined to be 325,000 +/- 40,000 by Na dodecyl-SO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzymatic properties of dynein 1 and dynein 2 are similar in substrate specificity, pH optimum, and Mg2+ requirement for ATPase activity, but they differ in their Michaelis constant and in their dependence of ATPase activity upon salt concentration. Digestion of dynein 2 with trypsin yields an ATPase-containing protein fragment, similar to Fragment A obtained from dynein 1. An antiserum prepared against Fragment A from dynein 1 did not precipitate dynein 2 or inhibit its ATPase activity."

https://openalex.org/W114735091,"Temporal patterns of biosynthesis of the Ca2+ + Mg2+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase of sarcomplasmic reticulum were obtained from studies with primary cultures of rat skeletal muscle cells. Rates of synthesis at various stages of differentiation were estimated from the incorporation of tritium-labeled leucine into the ATPase. Cells were solubilized with detergent, and newly synthesized ATPase was isolated from cells by antibody precipitation in the presence of carrier ATPase. Radioactivity incorporated into the ATPase was determined after gel electrophoresis of the precipitates and counting of gel slices containing the ATPase band. In Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum and 0.5% chick embryo extract, mononucleated myoblast cells began to form multinucleated myotubes after about 50 hours in culture. Prior to fusion little ATPase synthesis was detectable; during fusion the ATPase was synthesized at an accelerating rate for a period of about 30 hours. The rate of synthesis levelled off after about 90 hours coincident with termination of fusion. In Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum and 8% embryo extract, the onset of fusion was delayed for 30 to 40 hours. In this medium biosynthesis of the ATPase was also delayed so that biosynthesis of the ATPase appeared to be correlated with fusion of muscle cells. Cells cultured in Culbecco's modified Eagle's medium containgin 10% horse serum, but only 60 muM Ca2+, proliferated but did not fuse. Under these conditions, synthesis of the ATPase was measurable at 50 to 60 hours, and the rate of synthesis accelerated until 120 hours when it declined. Under all conditions degradation of the ATPase occurred with a half-life of 20 hours whereas the half-life of total protein degradation was 40 hours. Synthesis of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase, like that of a number of other muscle-specific proteins, is greatly accelerated as myoblasts fuse and differentiate into myotubes. Fusion is not essential for this phenomenon, however, although it is normally concomitant with it."
https://openalex.org/W1632392540,"The effects of various substrates and alternative substrates on the hydrolytic activity of beef heart mitochondrial ATPase was examined. It was found that ATP or ADP, ITP hydrolysis showed positive cooperativity. IDP inhibited ITP hydrolysis and caused positive cooperativity. When ITP was present during an ATP hydrolysis assay, the rate of ATP hydrolysis was stimulated. IDP had no effect on ATP hydrolysis rates. A nonhydrolyzable ITP analog, inosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate (IMP-P(NH)P), was synthesized and purified. It was found to be a potent competitive inhibitor of ITP and GTP hydrolytic activity. However, this beta-gamma-imido-bridged ITP analog was found to change the ITP and GTP hydrolysis kinetics from linear to positively cooperative. This compound inhibited ATP hydrolysis at substrate concentrations of 100 muM and lower, and stimulated ATP hydrolysis at substrate concentrations between 100 muM and 2 mM. IMP-P(NH)P had no effect on ATP hydrolysis when the substrate concentration was above 2 mM. In the presence of the activating anion, bicarbonate, IMP-P(NH)P inhibited ATP hydrolysis competitively, and induced positive cooperativity. IMP-P(NH)P had no effect on the ATP equilibrium Pi exchange, the ITP equilibrium Pi exchange, or ATP synthesis catalyzed by beef heart submitochondrial particles."
https://openalex.org/W1479760800,"In Neurospora cells grown on minimal medium, most of the large ornithine pool is found in osmotically sensitive organelles, the In this paper kinetic studies on the compartmental behavior of ornithine and its derivatives are reported. Analysis of the metabolism of a 10(-7) M pulse of uniformly labeled L-[14C] ornithine supports the following conclusions: (a) Over 98% of the cellular ornithine is in the vesicles. (b) The amount of ornithine normally in the cytosol is about 0.3% of the cellular ornithine, as shown by the kinetics of incorporation of 14C into putrescine via the cytosolic enzyme, ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17). (c) Mitochondria, the site of ornithine synthesis, contain about 1% of the cellular ornithine, as demonstrated by the kinetics of incorporation of 14C into citrulline via the mitochondrial enzyme, ornithine transcarbamylase (EC 2.1.3.3). (d) Considerable ornithine exchange, and a net efflux of ornithine, takes place across the mitochondrial membrane. (e) Ornithine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.13), a catabolic enzyme, may have a special relation to the cell membrane in cells grown in minimal medium. This enzyme uses ornithine efficiently while it enters from the medium, but very poorly after all the [14C] ornithine is within the cell. (f) Citrulline and proline are not compartmented with respect to the enzymes using them. (g) In contrast, arginine is distributed such that over 99% is in vesicles. We suggest that the vesicles; with their ability to sequester ornithine and arginine, are potentially significant in regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1564743723,"A substance has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rat liver which, as previously reported (Dunaway, G. A., Jr., and Segal, H. L. (1974) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 56, 689-696), specifically stabilizes the major liver isozyme of phosphofructokinase (PFK-L2) against thermal inactivation and whose level in vivo changes in parallel with and in precedence to that of the enzyme. Molecular weight determinations gave values around 3,500. Evidence for the peptide nature of the factor includes its correspondence with ninhydrin-positive material on gel filtration and paper electrophoresis and its susceptibility to pronase. Electrophoretic behavior indicated at least one free amino group and several carboxyl groups. Amino acid analysis of the peptide yielded only glutamate, glycine, and half-cystine, in equimolar amounts. However, neither GSH nor GSSG have PFK-L2-stabilizing activity. No free sulfhydryl groups were present. Chemical analysis for tryptophan was also negative. The ultraviolet spectrum confirmed the absence of aromatic amino acids. The spectrum exhibited a characteristic peptide peak at 190 nm with no absorbance beyond 240 nm. The factor is unstable to storage in the cold except in the presence of glucose or dithiothreitol. Sucrose, fructose, and GSH were ineffective in this regard. It was slowly denatured by heat or reduced pH even in the presence of glucose. The factor was induced in fasted animals specifically by glucose, of the nutrients tested, and in diabetic animals by insulin. Induction by both glucose and insulin was blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin. The time course of the glucose induction was the more rapid of the two with a marked overshoot to 3 times normal levels at 12 hours. Increased levels of the factor preceded the increased levels of PFK-L2 brought about by glucose or insulin administration. Native PFK-L2 was inactivated by lysosomal extracts, and this inactivation was strongly inhibited by the peptide factor. These results are in accord with the proposal that the peptide plays a role in regulating PFK-L2 turnover in vivo. The factor also activated the phosphofructokinase-catalyzed reaction by promoting fructose-6-P binding. This effect is analogous to that of AMP on the kinetics of the reaction; however, the factor effect was additive to that of AMP, and the factor did not reverse inhibition by excess ATP as does AMP. We postulate that the stabilizing factor affects an equilibrium between PFK-L2 conformers in favor of one more resistant to lysosomal and thermal inactivation and with greater affinity for fructose-6-P."

The higher affinity site (Kd = 0.2 mM) binds 6 to 7 nmol of sodium per mg of protein. Pretreatment of (Na+, K+)-ATPase with ouabain blocks the binding of sodium to this higher affinity site. Neither heat-denatured enzyme nor phospholipids extracted from the (Na+, K+)-ATPase contain a ouabain-inhibitable, higher affinity sodium binding site. The ouabain enzyme complex therefore appears to contain altered binding sites for cations."
https://openalex.org/W1563042731,"When human plasminogen and the bacterial protein streptokinase are mixed, a tight equimolar complex is formed in which an active center of well defined hydrolytic activity developes; this event precedes the cleavage of the plasminogen chain, i.e. the conversion to plasmin. Immediately after the formation of the complex, a series of proteolytic transformations occurs which, within a few minutes, results in at least two cleavages in the plasminogen, and at least five cleavages in the streptokinase peptide chains. None of the fragments so created seem to dissociate from the main body of the complex, but the activator activity, when measured by a rapid bovine clot-lysis system, undergoes a characteristic pattern of fluctuation coincident with the fragmentation of the two components. When the latter process is followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, the state of fragmentation of the activator can be correlated with the measured activator activities. By manipulating the temperature, and by the introduction of inhibitors, it was possible to slow down, or temporarily arrest, the fragmentation at certain stages, allowing the identification in a number of cases of the predominant activator species, and the determination of a characteristic relative activator activity for it. By the use of such relative activities, it was possible to carry out a calculation, based on electrophoretic analysis alone, which predicted reasonably successfully the kinetics of activator fluctuation."

https://openalex.org/W1543100825,"Incorporation of sulfate into alcian blue-precipitable glycosaminoglycan of 12-day-old chick embryo sterna is stimulated by addition, separately or together, of normal human serum and physiological concentrations of thyroid hormones (Audhya, T.K., and Gibson, K.D. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U. S. A. 72, 604--608). We present evidence that this stimulation is due to increased synthesis of at least one proteoglycan, with minor alterations in the size and chemical composition of the glycosaminoglycans. Pulse-chase experiments showed no detectable loss of label during the chase, in control sterna or sterna incubated with serum and L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine; thus, all incorporation was the result of synthesis of glycosaminoglycans. In double-label experiments, with 35SO4(2-) and [3H]acetate, the molar ratio of 3H and 35S incorporated into glycosaminoglycans was changed little, if at all, by addition of serum or triiodothyronine or both, at concentrations which increased incorporation up to 2-fold. Glycosaminoglycans isolated from these and other incubations gave similar elution patterns from agarose columns, and identical electrophoretic patterns on cellulose acetate. Digestion with chondroitinase ABC (chondroitin ABC lyase; EC 4.2.2.4.) showed that incorporation was into chondroitin sulfate and possibly hyaluronic acid, and that the proportions of non-sulfated, 4-sulfated, and 6-sulfated disaccharide units differed little between stimulated and unstimulated sterna. Incorporation of [3H]serine into glycosaminoglycans from papain digest of sterna paralleled incorporation of 35SO4(2-), and indicated a number average molecular weight between 21,000 and 25,000 for the newly synthesized chondroitin sulfate. This value was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography, which also showed that the average molecular weight of the newly synthesized chondroitin sulfate decreased up to 15% under conditions of 2-fold stimulation. Proteoglycans were extracted from sterna incubated with [3H]serine and 35SO4(2-) and analyzed by isopycinic centrifugation in CsCl and by zone sedimentation in a sucrose gradient. A major proteoglycan fraction could be separated by either method. Incorporation of both isotopes into this proteoglycan fraction, and into glycosaminoglycans isolated after papain digestion, was stimulated in a coordinate manner. Almost identical results were obtained with both separation techniques. The results indicate that the synthesis of the major proteoglycan, and probably also of a minor one, is stimulated by serum and triiodothyronine."

https://openalex.org/W1550580103,"The nature of the components and their location in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane were studied using sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from rat skeletal muscle and purified by a density gradient centrifugation system. On the basis of analysis by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, the components appear to be similar if not identical with those reported by others for rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the relative amount of each component is also similar to that found with rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum. Evidence is presented that radioiodine-labeled diazotized diiodosulfanilic acid is a nonpermeant labeling agent of the components of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles; this agent minimally disturbs the functional activities of these membranes. By means of this labeling agent and perturbing agents, it is concluded that the components with molecular weights greater than 120,000 and the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-adenosine triphosphatase partially or totally reside on or at the external surface of the sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. In the case of the adenosine triphosphatase, highly controlled trypsin treatment cleaves the molecule into two products, a 65,000 molecular weight fragment and a 56,000 molecular weight fragment. The evidence indicates that the 65,000 molecular weight component of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-adenosine triphosphatase is located in a more exposed fashion on the external surface of the vesicles than the 56,000 molecular weight compoenet and that some adenosine triphosphatase molecules have a more exposed position on the external surface of the vesicle than others. The components designated by MacLennan (MacLennan, D. H. (1975) Can. J. Biochem. 53, 251-261) as calsequestrin and high affinity Ca2+ binding protein are shown not to be on the external surface of the rat sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicle but rather to reside either within the core of the membrane or on the inside surface of the vesicle. The results of this study are in agreement with the model for the organization of the components of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrene recently proposed by MacLennan (MacLennan, D. H. (1975) Can. J.

https://openalex.org/W1490057636,"1. Ethanol metabolism in slices or homogenates of transplantable hepatocellular carcinoma HC-252 (HC-252) was 50 to 60% of the rate found in host liver slices or homogenates when they were expressed per gram of tissue wet weight and 70 to 80% of the liver when the rates were expressed per milligram of tissue protein. At 10 mM ethanol, the activities of alcohol dehydrogenase in tumor and liver supernatants were comparable. 2. Tumor microsomes did not oxidize ethanol in the presence of a NADPH-generating system, indicating the absence of the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system and catalase-mediated peroxidation of ethanol. The HC-252 microsomes were contaminated with catalase, and acetaldehyde production occurred in the presence of a H2O2-generating system (xanthine oxidase). The virtual absence of ethanol oxidation and drug metabolism (aminopyrine demethylase and aniline hydroxylase) in HC-252 microsomes may be due to the low activities of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, NADPH oxidase, and NADPH-dependent oxygen uptake. 3. Microsomal oxidation of ethanol was present in Morris hepatoma 5123C, a well-differentiated tumor of intermediate growth rate, while activity was negligible in microsomes from Morris hepatoma 7288CTC, a less differentiated tumor. Microsomal NADPH oxidase was present in the well differentiated tumor 5123C but was lacking in the less differentiated tumor 7288CTC. Several microsomal, mitochondrial, and cytosolic properties of HC-252 are similar to those of Morris hepatoma 7288CTC but differ from those of the more differentiated 5123C tumor and normal liver. 4. The content of mitochondrial protein in HC-252 was only 25% that of liver, and oxygen consumption per gram of tumor was only 28% that of the liver. When corrected for the mitochondrial protein content, oxygen uptake in tumor HC-252 and liver homogenates was comparable. Isolated tumor and liver mitochondria displayed comparable State 4 and 3 rates of oxygen consumption with succinate and glutamate as substrates. The activities of the reconstituted malate-aspartate and alpha-glycerophosphate shuttles were only slightly lower in isolated HC-252 mitochondria compared to liver mitochondria, when shuttles were reconstituted with purified enzymes. 5. Antimycin inhibited alcohol metabolism,and pyruvate stimulated alcohol metabolism, much less in tumor slices than in liver slices, suggesting the presence of an augmented mitochondria-independent, cytosolic mechanism for oxidizing reducing equivalents in the tumor. These factors suggest that oxidation of NADH is the limiting factor in ethanol metabolism. Whereas, in the liver mitochondrial reoxidation is predominant, in HC-252, cytosolic reoxidation of NADH also plays a major role."

These (and their epimeric carbons) included: D-psicose-6-P (C-3), D-tagatose-6-P (C-4), and L-sorbose-6-P (C-5). The Michaelis constants (and relative maximal velocities) were: 3.0 mM (45%), 0.054 mM (104%), and 11 mM (15%), respectively. Under the same conditions, D-fructose-6-P had a Km of 0.043 mM and an arbitrary Vmax of 100%. The low affinity of the enzyme for D-psicose-6-P indicates that the L configuration at C-3 is required for effective binding, a specificity similar to several other fructose-metabolizing enzymes. The D configuration at C-5 is also important for tight binding and the proper orientation of the phosphate group of the substrate. The kinetic constants of D-tagatose-6-P were identical with those of D-fructose-6-P, within experimental error. Thus, the configuration at C-4 is not essential for activity; an indication that D-tagatose may be utilized in mammalian tissues. A novel method for the synthesis of D-psicose-6-P and an improved procedure for the synthesis of D-tagatose-6-P are described.

https://openalex.org/W1485115096,"Ethoxyformylation of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles is performed to study a possible role of histidine residues in the calcium translocation process. The influence of the chemical modification is evaluated on the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity, and on the Ca2+ uptake parameters: VCa (initial rate of calcium uptake) and CCa (amount of cation accumulated at the steady state). The substitution of the amino acids is monitored by three different techniques: (a) by amino acid analysis of the ethoxyformylated material further submitted to modification by diazonium-1-H-tetrazole, or by sulfhydryl titration using 5-5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid); (b) by 14C labeling followed by the removing of labels after NH2OH or imidazole treatment at pH 7; (c) by spectrophotometric measurements at 230 nm. The ethoxyformylation reaction is not specific for histidine at pH 6.1 and 10 degrees. About 1 lysyl group/mol of ATPase is first modified. Then 1 (with a pseudo-first order rate constant of 240 (+/- 20) 10(-3) min-1) or 2 histidines are modified. No substitution of tyrosine or sulfhydryl groups can be detected under our experimental conditions. A decrease of the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity correlated with the inhibition of both VCa and Cca corresponds to the chemical substitution of the histidine. No direct correlation between the decrease of the activities and the modification of the lysine can be found. After removing the ethoxyformyl group from the histidine, only the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity is restored to its initial value. No protection is found when the reaction is performed in the presence of ATP or p-nitrophenylphosphate. These results can be explained if one assumes that the ethoxyformylation of the histidine residue(s) induces a conformational change modifying the affinity of the membrane for nucleotides."
