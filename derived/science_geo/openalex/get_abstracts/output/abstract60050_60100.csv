https://openalex.org/W1529541887,"Abstract Human red blood cell membranes treated with galactose oxidase were specifically labeled in galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine residues by reduction with tritiated borohydride. Ceramide tri- and tetrahexosides were the most intensely reactive lipid species. Several labeled polypeptide peaks were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. While some of the radioactivity appeared to correspond to known, principal glycoproteins, a major part of the label was distributed in regions of the gel bearing only weakly stained protein and glycoprotein components. The pattern of labeling was essentially the same for intact erythrocytes and unsealed ghosts. Preparations of sealed, inside-out vesicles showed very little labeling, all of which could be attributed to small amounts of contamination from accessible outer surface. On this basis, all of the glycoprotein and glycolipid sugars reactive with galactose oxidase plus tritiated borohydride can be assigned to the external surface of the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1558696651,"Abstract In most procedures for the isolation of membrane-bound or soluble succinate dehydrogenase, the enzyme is obtained largely in the deactivated form. As judged by the quantity of oxalacetate enzymatically determined in perchlorate extracts, the deactivated form contains tightly bound oxalacetate in 1:1 proportion to the enzyme (equated with histidyl flavin content) in particles. A somewhat lower ratio has been obtained for soluble preparations of the enzyme. The oxalacetate is bound very tightly: it is not displaced by succinate or malonate in the cold, nor released by precipitation or gel exclusion of the enzyme, and it does not react with malate dehydrogenase. It is released, however, on denaturation of the enzyme with perchloric acid or under conditions which favor conversion of the enzyme to the activated form. If the enzyme is freed from oxalacetate by activation with bromide and gel exclusion, treatment of the oxalacetate-free fully active enzyme with very low concentrations of l- or d-malate or oxalacetate leads to deactivation and concomitant formation of tightly bound oxalacetate in the same molar ratio found in the enzyme as isolated from heart mitochondria. Dissociation of the complex formed in this manner requires the same experimental conditions as those needed for dissociation of the complex as found in the isolated enzyme. The activation energies for activation and for release of oxalacetate are the same but vary with the type of activator used. The first order rate constant for activation by a variety of agents is about twice that measured for the dissociation of tightly bound oxalacetate. Moreover, with some activators oxalacetate release shows a considerable lag behind recovery of catalytic activity. It is suggested that the presence of oxalacetate in the deactivated enzyme is not the cause of its lack of catalytic activity but a consequence of the deactivated conformation. Further observations are described which suggest that a deactivation-activation cycle may also occur in the absence of oxalacetate."

https://openalex.org/W1585589022,"Abstract Human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor has been isolated in 55% yield from human pancreatic juice and in 45% yield from human post mortem pancreata by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 in the presence of 10-4 m diisopropyl phosphofluoridate and by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and SP-Sephadex. The polypeptide inhibitor has a molecular weight of 6242 and contains 56 amino acid residues per molecule: Asp3, Asn5, Thr4, Ser3, Glu4, Gln2, Pro3, Gly5, Ala1, Cys6, Val2, Ile3, Leu4, Tyr3, Phe1, Lys4, and Arg3 and does not contain glucosamine or galactosamine. The inhibitor was isolated as five chromatographic forms with identical amino acid content, specific activity for trypsin inhibition and molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. All forms of the inhibitor are homogeneous by acrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid analysis, and on the basis of the stoichiometry of their interaction with trypsin. All of the three forms subjected to Edman degradation had Asx-Ser as their NH2-terminal residues. The multiple chromatographic forms could be distinguished on the basis of chromatographic behavior on ion exchange resins, by acrylamide gel electrophoresis and, for the three major forms, on the basis of amide content and susceptibility to enzymatic digestion. It is concluded that the multiple chromatographic forms differ in amide content. The inhibitor is secreted in the pancreatic juice in the free form (not combined with trypsin) in an amount equivalent to 0.1 to 0.8% of the total protein in pancreatic juice. The inhibitor is of the Kazal type and similar to the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitors isolated from pancreatic juice of other species. The human inhibitor is the only pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor studied which effectively inhibits human cationic trypsin."

https://openalex.org/W1546479429,"Abstract β-d-N-Acetylhexosaminidase A and B purified to homogeneity from human placenta have pH optima of 4.4 using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-N-acetylgalactosaminide as substrate. The Km of both hexosaminidase A and hexosaminidase B for this synthetic substrate was found to be 0.5 mm and heat of activation for both the enzymes was 10,500 cal. No effect of any divalent ions studied was observed except for a 25% decrease in the enzyme activity of both hexosaminidase A and B in the presence of 5 mm cupric ion. p-Hydroxymercuribenzoate, 1 mm, almost completely inhibited both hexosaminidase A and hexosaminidase B activity. N-Ethylmaleimide, arsenate, and iodoacetate had no effect on the hexosaminidases. No inhibition of hexosaminidase A or hexosaminidase B was observed in the presence of 30 mm concentration of various anions except for acetate which brought about 75% inhibition of both hexosaminidase A and hexosaminidase B activity. Using Sephadex G-200 filtration, the molecular weight of hexosaminidase A and B was estimated at 140,000. However, using the sedimentation equilibrium technique the molecular weight was found to be 100,000 ± 3,000 and 101,400 ± 4,700 for hexosaminidase A and B, respectively. After S-carboxymethylation, the subunit molecular weight of hexosaminidase A and B was determined using various concentrations of polyacrylamide in disc electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Hexosaminidase B dissociated into one major subunit corresponding to a molecular weight of 17,000 to 18,000, whereas hexosaminidase A dissociated into one major subunit corresponding to a molecular weight of 17,000 to 18,000 and two more protein bands corresponding to about 35,000 and to 55,000. Similar results were obtained when hexosaminidase A and B were dissociated into subunits by treatment with guanidine hydrochloride or by treatment with maleic anhydride in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and the subunits separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In urea-starch gel electrophoresis hexosaminidase A dissociated into three major bands and hexosaminidase B into two bands. In urea-starch gel the electrophoretic mobility of one of the bands of dissociated hexosaminidase A and hexosaminidase B seemed to be very similar or identical. Both hexosaminidase A and hexosaminidase B have blocked NH2-terminal groups. The COOH-terminal amino acids in hexosaminidase A was found to be serine and in hexosaminidase B was found to be aspartic acid or asparagine. The amino acid composition of hexosaminidase A and hexosaminidase B was determined and found to differ."
https://openalex.org/W1564157098,"Acidic extraction procedures were shown to yield two discrete globulin fractions, G1 and G2, from french bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) seeds. The G1 fraction was found to be capable of reversible dissociation between tetrameric, protomeric, an peptide configurations, having s020, w values of 18.2 S, 7.1 S, and 3.0 S, respectively. The G2 fraction, s020, w = 6.6 S, was found not to undergo pH-dependent association but did irreversibly dissociate into unstable peptide components, s020, w = 1.6 S, at pH 13.0. A single boundary in sedimentation velocity studies has frequently been accepted as evidence for the presence of a homogeneous protein. However, it was possible to show that a mixture of G1 and G2 globulins gave two discrete boundaries at acid pH, while at neutral and alkaline pH values a mixture of the protomeric G1 globulin and the G2 fraction cosedimented in a single boundary."
https://openalex.org/W1488834178,"Abstract The response of Phycomyces sporangiophores to various stimuli show up as changes in the elongation rate of the cell wall, a structure largely composed of chitin fibrils. The enzyme chitin synthetase was chosen as the subject of this study for the possible role that regulation of its activity might play in the behavioral outputs. A simple assay for the chitin synthetase has been developed. Membrane preparations from the mycelia of Phycomyces were found to catalyze the synthesis of chitin from UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. Both Mg2+ and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine stimulate the enzyme activity. The pH optimum for the enzyme activity is about 6.5, and the temperature optimum is about 28°. The Km for UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine is 0.6 mm. The antibiotic polyoxin D competitively inhibits the activity at levels which are comparable to those required for the inhibition of mycelial growth. In the presence of polyoxin D (0.1 mm), germinating spores of Phycomyces develop into protoplast-like structures. At concentrations up to 0.5 mm, ATP stimulates the enzyme activity and at 2 mm, cyclic 3' : 5'-AMP is slightly inhibitory. The enzyme activity was found in the Phycomyces mycelia of different ages as well as in the sporangiophores of each of the five developmental stages. Phycomyces mycelial homogenate was fractionated through a series of differential and isopynic centrifugations. Each fraction was studied for its (a) specific and total chitin synthetase activities; (b) morphology under the electron microscope; and (c) specific and total activities of the marker enzymes 5'-nucleotidase (plasma membrane), glucose 6-phosphatase (endoplasmic reticulum), succinic-2-(p-indophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl tetrazolium-reductase (mitochondria), catalase (peroxisomes) and acid phosphatase (lysosomes). The fraction which exhibited the highest specific activity contained essentially only membraneous structures. The distribution of the specific chitin synthetase activity coincided with that of 5'-nucleotidase activity and did not coincide with that of any of the other marker enzymes. These results suggest that the chitin synthetase is a plasma membrane-bound enzyme. Autoradiography studies showed that along the sporangiophore the growing zone (where cell elongation takes place) has higher chitin synthetase activity than the nongrowing zone."
https://openalex.org/W1553844574,"Abstract Adenylate cyclase from Brevibacterium liquefaciens was purified to apparent homogeneity and crystallized. The purification was achieved by conventional procedures starting from crude extracts obtained by the digestion of bacteria with lysozyme. The over-all purification was 4500-fold with a yield of 10%. The purified enzyme was activated by pyruvate, and catalyzed the conversion of 30 µmoles of ATP to adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate and PPi per min per mg of protein under the standard assay conditions. The purified enzyme was apparently homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses and immunological criteria. Polyhedral crystals were obtained from an ammonium sulfate solution of the enzyme. A minimum weight average molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be 92,400 by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation using a partial specific volume of 0.728 ml per g. Gel filtration experiments on columns of Sephadex G-200 indicated a Stokes radius of about 49 A. Ultracentrifugation in sucrose density gradients revealed that the purified enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of about 4.5 S which was not affected by the presence of pyruvate and Mg2+. On the basis of these physical parameters, a frictional ratio of about 1.6 was calculated. The enzyme was dissociated into subunits by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that in gels containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, the two subunits had the same molecular weight of 46,000 and in gels containing 8 m urea, the denatured enzyme migrated as a single species. These results indicated that the native enzyme consists of two polypeptide chains, identical or very similar in size and charge. Certain other properties of the enzyme are also described."

https://openalex.org/W2078734345,"JENSEN has argued that the undoubted differences in mean IQ scores between racial groups in the United States reflect differences in genetic endowment. But a major problem in the interpretation of these differences is the difficulty of studying environmental and genetic effects separately. Each race tends to have, for historical reasons, characteristic child-rearing practices which are to some extent independent of social class. Hence the argument that because black children tend to have lower IQs than white children of the same social class they are genetically inferior is unconvincing; the inferior test scores could result from differences in the microenvironment of the family, such as linguistic practices and attitudes to achievement."

https://openalex.org/W1481047404,"Abstract Hepatic β-galactosidases were studied in tissues of five patients with Gm1-gangliosidosis. Activities of 4-methylumbelliferyl, lactosylceramide, Gm1-ganglioside and asialo Gm1-ganglioside β-galactosidases were deficient in livers of patients. In contrast, activities of galactosylceramide β-galactosidase were generally higher than in control tissues. The peak of residual activities of 4-methylumbelliferyl β-galactosidase had an abnormal isoelectric point of 4.6 to 4.7 by electrofocusing. In a late onset type II patient, the activity peaks of galactosylceramide and lactosylceramide β-galactosidases had isoelectric points similar to those in normal control liver tissues, while two patients with type I disease showed highly abnormal electrofocusing patterns of these enzymes. The peaks were shifted substantially toward lower pH. These findings indicate that, in addition to the frank deficiency of some sphingolipid β-galactosidases, there are more subtle and extensive abnormalities of β-galactosidases in Gm1-gangliosidosis. The difference in the electrofocusing patterns of galactosylceramide and lactosylceramide β-galactosidases suggests another enzymatic criterion which might possibly differentiate the phenotypically defined two types of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1979339594,"SEVERAL mechanisms have been proposed to account for the reactive hyperaemia which follows arterial occlusion in the kidney, including the intrarenal production of a vasodilator substance1,2. Recent work shows that the local generation of a prostaglandin can cause vasodilatation in the kidney3,4 and can contribute to autoregulation of renal blood flow5,6. We have therefore used a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, indomethacin7, to test whether the reactive hyperaemia which follows release of renal artery occlusion is mediated by a prostaglandin mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1544902631,"Abstract Specific glycosphingolipid β-galactosidases were assayed in liver tissues from two controls and two patients with globoid cell leukodystrophy. Specifically labeled natural substrates, galactosylceramide, lactosylceramide, Gm1-ganglioside, and asialo Gm1-ganglioside, were used for the assays. Among the natural substrates tested, only galactosylceramide β-galactosidase was profoundly deficient in globoid cell leukodystrophy while other sphingolipid β-galactosidases were normal. When fractionated by electrofocusing, the distribution of lactosylceramide and asialo Gm1-ganglioside β-galactosidases was relatively normal, but the distribution of the reference enzyme, 4-methylumbelliferyl β-galactosidase, was abnormal in that, instead of the normal three peaks of activity, there was a major peak with the isoelectric point in the range of pH 4.6 to 4.8. The residual activities of galactosylceramide β-galactosidase were observed as a broad peak after electrofocusing around the isoelectric point of 4.6 in one case and of 4.8 in another. These isoelectric points corresponded to those of the abnormal 4-methylumbelliferyl β-galactosidase peaks in the respective cases. These findings suggest that the genetic mutation in human globoid cell leukodystrophy may cause more complex and extensive abnormalities among β-galactosidases than simple deficiency of one specific glycosphingolipid β-galactosidase."

https://openalex.org/W1562014642,"Abstract The major exocellular glycopeptide (peptidophosphogalactomannan) produced by Penicillium charlesii was shown to contain 30 to 32 amino acid residues, and serine and threonine accounted for approximately 15 residues. In addition, the glycopeptide was found to contain approximately 1 ethanolamine residue per molecule. Treatment of the glycopeptide with alkali resulted in an increase in absorbance at 241 nm with the concomitant release of peptide from monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and phosphogalactomannan. The number of seryl and threonyl residues decreased markedly following alkaline borohydride-PdCl2 treatment of the glycopeptide. This treatment also resulted in an increase in alanine and the appearance of α-aminobutyric acid after hydrolyzing the reaction mixture in 6 n HCl. In addition, treatment of the glycopeptide with alkaline NaB3H4 followed by hydrolyzing the phosphogalactomannan in 2 n HCl resulted in the formation of [3H]mannitol. We conclude that the phosphogalactomannan is attached to the peptide through O-glycosidic linkage of the terminal mannosyl residue to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine."
https://openalex.org/W1593220894,"Abstract Insolubilized α-chymotrypsin bound to porous glass gel has been prepared. The kinetic behavior of this fixed enzyme proved to be the same as that of the free enzyme. The effects of aprotic dipolar organic solvents on the kinetics of α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis were successfully studied using this insolubilized enzyme at concentrations up to 95 % v/v dioxane, taking advantage of the inability of the enzyme to aggregate. This is a considerably higher organic solvent concentration than has been achieved in homogeneous solution. The kinetic parameters of the insolubilized α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of N-acetyl-l-tryptophan p-nitrophenyl ester and N-benzoyl-l-tyrosine p-nitroanilide in aqueous organic solvent medium were determined. The specific rate constant of the acylation step, κ2, does not depend on organic solvent concentration. However, the apparent Michaelis constant, Km, and deacylation rate constant, κ3, depend strongly on the organic solvent concentration. The data are discussed in terms of microscopic reversibility proposed previously for the mechanism of α-chymotrypsin action."

https://openalex.org/W1564592119,"Abstract The substrate requirements for estrogen sulfotransferase have been examined. Structural changes in all four rings of the estratriene nucleus affected sulfation. The Vmax of the reaction was increased from 1.4 to 3.2 times over that of estrone by nitro groups at positions 2 or 4, or the 6-keto function, while in the presence of a 2-amino group sulfation decreased to ⅓ and saturation of the A ring reduced sulfation to zero. The enzyme did not sulfate an OH in position 2 or 4 of estrogens but sulfated, with decreased efficiency, the phenolic-OH on 6-benzoyl-naphthol, anthraquinone, fluorenes, diphenyl, and tetraline. Examination of 60 structural variations has shown the optimal sulfation of the phenolic-OH to require (a) the presence of a lipophilic side chain (7 A long, para to the OH), and (b) in the estratriene nucleus, an oxygen atom for hydrogen bonding to an area of the enzyme within 3.72 A above ring D."

The proportion of deaths is usually highest in the calves and in gravid females. High death rates in diminishing animal species such as tsessebe (Damaliscus lunatus) have occurred in spite of all precautions, such as the use of a helicopter to reduce the time between alerting the subject animal and the placement of a syringe containing suitable immobilising compounds."

https://openalex.org/W1673217901,"Abstract The use of a reaction involving [14C]cyanide and ammonia to stabilize and identify aldehydic cross-links in elastin and collagen is described. The products resulting from acid hydrolysis are in the form of 14C-labeled amino acids. The reaction was first studied with periodate-treated collagens, used as a model of collagen with aldehyde side chains. In these collagens the α-aminoglutaryl γ-semialdehyde residues react with [14C]cyanide and ammonia almost quantitatively and the expected product, after acid hydrolysis, is predominantly [14C]α, δ-diaminoadipic acid. This product indeed was isolated and identified. In elastin three amino acids derived from cross-links were isolated and their structures established. They are α,e-diaminopimelic acid, 1,9-diamino-1,9-dicarboxy-4-glycino-non-4-ene (carboxy amino aldol), and 2-amino-6-lysinopimelic acid (carboxylysinonorleucine). These compounds arise, respectively, from modification of residues of α-amino adipic acid δ-semialdehyde,aldol condensate of α-aminoadlpic acid δ-semialdehyde, and dehydrolysinonorleucine, and are in full agreement with structures of such compounds previously deduced using established sodium borohydride reduction procedures. Aldimines are modified with cyanide directly, not requiring the presence of ammonia. Cross-links already in the reduced form in the native protein, and the pyridinium forms of the desmosines do not incorporate the label and can be directly observed and quantitated by established procedures. The contents of modified cross-links can be estimated when the specific activity of Na14CN is known."

https://openalex.org/W1544034471,"Abstract An analysis of the subunit structure of l-threonine dehydratase (l-threonine hydro-lyase (deaminating)) from Clostridium tetanomorphum has revealed that the native enzyme, with a molecular weight of 184,000, is composed of four apparently identical subunits. This conclusion was based on the results obtained from peptide maps, cyanogen bromide cleavage patterns, sedimentation coefficients of maleylated enzyme, and molecular weight estimated in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride plus 1 mm mercaptoethanol. Furthermore, threonine dehydratase was found to contain 4 moles of pyridoxal phosphate per mole of native enzyme. Evidence was also gathered that the protomer of molecular weight 46,000 was composed of two nonidentical peptide chains of approximately 29,000 and 17,000 molecular weight. This was supported by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, carboxyl-terminal analysis, chromatography on guanidine-agarose columns, and sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation of carboxamidomethylated enzyme in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. The fact that strongly dissociating and reducing conditions were necessary to produce species less than 46,000 suggest that the subprotomeric polypeptide chains are disulfide bridged."
https://openalex.org/W2014196945,"α-BUNGAROTOXIN, a specific and irreversible binding agent of acetylcholine receptors of the motor endplate1,2 and of other nicotinic cholinergic receptors3, has no inhibitory effect upon acetylcholinesterase preparation from electroplax of electric eel3. Štale and Župančič4 have, however, reported that, when a minced preparation of mouse diaphragm was used, α-bungarotoxin as well as d-tubocurarine markedly inhibited the membrane acetylcholinesterase when acetylcholine concentrations lower than 12 µM were used. They took this result as evidence to support their hypothesis that the anionic centre of the enzyme in the motor endplate is the acetylcholine receptor5. We attempted, therefore, to re-examine the effect of α-bungarotoxin by using intact acetylcholinesterase in the motor endplate in order to test the hypothesis and to establish the specificity of binding of the toxin."

https://openalex.org/W1532048489,"Abstract Rabbit reticulocytes were pulse-labeled with [3H]leucine in a medium supporting protein synthesis in the absence or presence of 10-3 m hydroxylamine. When hydroxylamine was present, incorporation into soluble globin (primarily α chains) and α-hemoglobin intermediates was decreased and that into completed α2β2-hemoglobin was increased compared to the control without hydroxylamine. These results are similar to those found previously (Kruh, J., and Blum, N. (1968) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 161, 215–222). Hydroxylamine also stimulated the conversion of previously synthesized globin and α-hemoglobin into α2β2-hemoglobin in an isolated cell supernatant in the absence of de novo protein synthesis; the incorporated polypeptides were not loosely bound to pre-existing hemoglobin and appeared to be part of α2β2-hemoglobin structure. Methemoglobin was formed during the incubations with hydroxylamine. Moreover, ferricyanide ion also stimulated the conversion of soluble α chain intermediates into completed hemoglobin in a manner similar to that of hydroxylamine. These results and those of other investigations are consistent with the hypothesis that hydroxylamine stimulates the conversion of a small soluble pool of α-hemoglobin chains into α2β2-hemoglobin by an exchange mechanism. This mechanism probably occurs by the following steps: (a) hydroxylamine promotes the oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin; (b) some of the ferriheme groups readily dissociate from the methemoglobin β chains, forming a small pool of α2hβ2o-semihemoglobin; (c) the semihemoglobin further partially dissociates into α-hemoglobin and β-globin chains; and (d) α-hemoglobin chains are incorporated into completed hemoglobin by reassociation in the reverse direction."
