https://openalex.org/W2949410666,"Neural organoids have the potential to improve our understanding of human brain development and neurological disorders. However, it remains to be seen whether these tissues can model circuit formation with functional neuronal output. Here we have adapted air-liquid interface culture to cerebral organoids, leading to improved neuronal survival and axon outgrowth. The resulting thick axon tracts display various morphologies, including long-range projection within and away from the organoid, growth-cone turning, and decussation. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals various cortical neuronal identities, and retrograde tracing demonstrates tract morphologies that match proper molecular identities. These cultures exhibit active neuronal networks, and subcortical projecting tracts can innervate mouse spinal cord explants and evoke contractions of adjacent muscle in a manner dependent on intact organoid-derived innervating tracts. Overall, these results reveal a remarkable self-organization of corticofugal and callosal tracts with a functional output, providing new opportunities to examine relevant aspects of human CNS development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2921773684,"The establishment of cell types during development requires precise interactions between genes and distal regulatory sequences. We have a limited understanding of how these interactions look in three dimensions, vary across cell types in complex tissue, and relate to transcription. Here we describe optical reconstruction of chromatin architecture (ORCA), a method that can trace the DNA path in single cells with nanoscale accuracy and genomic resolution reaching two kilobases. We used ORCA to study a Hox gene cluster in cryosectioned Drosophila embryos and labelled around 30 RNA species in parallel. We identified cell-type-specific physical borders between active and Polycomb-repressed DNA, and unexpected Polycomb-independent borders. Deletion of Polycomb-independent borders led to ectopic enhancer–promoter contacts, aberrant gene expression, and developmental defects. Together, these results illustrate an approach for high-resolution, single-cell DNA domain analysis in vivo, identify domain structures that change with cell identity, and show that border elements contribute to the formation of physical domains in Drosophila. Optical reconstruction of chromatin architecture and multiplex RNA labelling traces the DNA path in single cells and its relationship to transcription."

Characterization of these genes could be greatly accelerated by new genetic resources for unicellular organisms. Here we generated a genome-wide, indexed library of mapped insertion mutants for the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The 62,389 mutants in the library, covering 83% of nuclear protein-coding genes, are available to the community. Each mutant contains unique DNA barcodes, allowing the collection to be screened as a pool. We performed a genome-wide survey of genes required for photosynthesis, which identified 303 candidate genes. Characterization of one of these genes, the conserved predicted phosphatase-encoding gene CPL3, showed that it is important for accumulation of multiple photosynthetic protein complexes. Notably, 21 of the 43 higher-confidence genes are novel, opening new opportunities for advances in understanding of this biogeochemically fundamental process. This library will accelerate the characterization of thousands of genes in algae, plants, and animals."
https://openalex.org/W2963730065,"The tunnelling of a particle through a potential barrier is a key feature of quantum mechanics that goes to the core of wave–particle duality. The phenomenon has no counterpart in classical physics, and there are no well constructed dynamical observables that could be used to determine ‘tunnelling times’. The resulting debate1–5 about whether a tunnelling quantum particle spends a finite and measurable time under a potential barrier was reignited in recent years by the advent of ultrafast lasers and attosecond metrology6. Particularly important is the attosecond angular streaking (‘attoclock’) technique7, which can time the release of electrons in strong-field ionization with a precision of a few attoseconds. Initial measurements7–10 confirmed the prevailing view that tunnelling is instantaneous, but later studies11,12 involving multi-electron atoms—which cannot be accurately modelled, complicating interpretation of the ionization dynamics—claimed evidence for finite tunnelling times. By contrast, the simplicity of the hydrogen atom enables precise experimental measurements and calculations13–15 and makes it a convenient benchmark. Here we report attoclock and momentum-space imaging16 experiments on atomic hydrogen and compare these results with accurate simulations based on the three-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation and our experimental laser pulse parameters. We find excellent agreement between measured and simulated data, confirming the conclusions of an earlier theoretical study17 of the attoclock technique in atomic hydrogen that presented a compelling argument for instantaneous tunnelling. In addition, we identify the Coulomb potential as the sole cause of the measured angle between the directions of electron emission and peak electric field: this angle had been attributed11,12 to finite tunnelling times. We put an upper limit of 1.8 attoseconds on any tunnelling delay, in agreement with recent theoretical findings18 and ruling out the interpretation of all commonly used ‘tunnelling times’19 as ‘time spent by an electron under the potential barrier’20. Simulation and measurement of the photoionization of atomic hydrogen at attosecond resolution confirm that the tunnelling of the ejected electron is instantaneous."

https://openalex.org/W2920966707,"Recent studies have revealed a role for macrophages and neutrophils in limiting chemotherapy efficacy; however, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic benefit of myeloid-targeting agents in combination with chemotherapy are incompletely understood. Here, we show that targeting tumour-associated macrophages by colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) blockade in the K14cre;Cdh1F/F;Trp53F/F transgenic mouse model for breast cancer stimulates intratumoural type I interferon (IFN) signalling, which enhances the anticancer efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapeutics. Notably, anti-CSF-1R treatment also increased intratumoural expression of type I IFN-stimulated genes in patients with cancer, confirming that CSF-1R blockade is a powerful strategy to trigger an intratumoural type I IFN response. By inducing an inflamed, type I IFN-enriched tumour microenvironment and by further targeting immunosuppressive neutrophils during cisplatin therapy, antitumour immunity was activated in this poorly immunogenic breast cancer mouse model. These data illustrate the importance of breaching multiple layers of immunosuppression during cytotoxic therapy to successfully engage antitumour immunity in breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2921997068,"All circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in human newborns are of maternal origin1 and transferred across the placenta to provide passive immunity until newborn IgG production takes over 15 weeks after birth2. However, maternal IgG can also negatively interfere with newborn vaccine responses3. The concentration of IgG increases sharply during the third trimester of gestation and children delivered extremely preterm are believed to largely lack this passive immunity1,2,4. Antibodies to individual viruses have been reported5–12, but the global repertoire of maternal IgG, its variation in children, and the epitopes targeted are poorly understood. Here, we assess antibodies against 93,904 epitopes from 206 viruses in 32 preterm and 46 term mother–child dyads. We find that extremely preterm children receive comparable repertoires of IgG as term children, albeit at lower absolute concentrations and consequent shorter half-life. Neutralization of the clinically important respiratory syncytial virus (RS-virus) was also comparable until three months of age. These findings have implications for understanding infectious disease susceptibility, vaccine development, and vaccine scheduling in newborn children. A longitudinal survey of maternal antiviral antibodies in newborns provides a blueprint for understanding infectious disease susceptibility and vaccine development, and inform vaccine scheduling in newborn children."

https://openalex.org/W2922311875,"Electron microscopy (EM) is a powerful tool for circuit mapping, but identifying specific cell types in EM datasets remains a major challenge. Here we describe a technique enabling simultaneous visualization of multiple genetically identified neuronal populations so that synaptic interactions between them can be unequivocally defined. We present 15 adeno-associated virus constructs and 6 mouse reporter lines for multiplexed EM labeling in the mammalian nervous system. These reporters feature dAPEX2, which exhibits dramatically improved signal compared with previously described ascorbate peroxidases. By targeting this enhanced peroxidase to different subcellular compartments, multiple orthogonal reporters can be simultaneously visualized and distinguished under EM using a protocol compatible with existing EM pipelines. Proof-of-principle double and triple EM labeling experiments demonstrated synaptic connections between primary afferents, descending cortical inputs, and inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Our multiplexed peroxidase-based EM labeling system should therefore greatly facilitate analysis of connectivity in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2921664367,"The use of competitive inhibitors to disrupt protein–protein interactions (PPIs) holds great promise for the treatment of disease. However, the discovery of high-affinity inhibitors can be a challenge. Here we report a platform for improving the affinity of peptide-based PPI inhibitors using non-canonical amino acids. The platform utilizes size exclusion-based enrichment from pools of synthetic peptides (1.5–4 kDa) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based peptide sequencing to identify high-affinity binders to protein targets, without the need for ‘reporter’ or ‘encoding’ tags. Using this approach—which is inherently selective for high-affinity binders—we realized gains in affinity of up to ~100- or ~30-fold for binders to the oncogenic ubiquitin ligase MDM2 or HIV capsid protein C-terminal domain, which inhibit MDM2–p53 interaction or HIV capsid protein C-terminal domain dimerization, respectively. Subsequent macrocyclization of select MDM2 inhibitors rendered them cell permeable and cytotoxic toward cancer cells, demonstrating the utility of the identified compounds as functional PPI inhibitors. Affinity-based selection in solution enables the identification of high-affinity ligands for disrupting the MDM2–p53 interaction and binding to the HIV capsid protein from libraries of both linear and cyclic peptides containing non-canonical amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2921189699,"Epigenetic regulation by the type II protein arginine methyltransferase, PRMT5, plays an essential role in the control of cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In this report, we investigate the relationship between PRMT5 and WNT/β-CATENIN as well as AKT/GSK3β proliferative signaling in three different types of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cell lines, clinical samples, and mouse primary lymphoma cells. We show that PRMT5 stimulates WNT/β-CATENIN signaling through direct epigenetic silencing of pathway antagonists, AXIN2 and WIF1, and indirect activation of AKT/GSK3β signaling. PRMT5 inhibition with either shRNA-mediated knockdown or a specific small molecule PRMT5 inhibitor, CMP-5, not only leads to derepression of WNT antagonists and decreased levels of active phospho-AKT (Thr-450 and Ser-473) and inactive phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9) but also results in decreased transcription of WNT/β-CATENIN target genes, CYCLIN D1, c-MYC, and SURVIVIN, and enhanced lymphoma cell death. Furthermore, PRMT5 inhibition leads to reduced recruitment of co-activators CBP, p300, and MLL1, as well as enhanced recruitment of co-repressors HDAC2 and LSD1 to the WNT/β-CATENIN target gene promoters. These results indicate that PRMT5 governs expression of prosurvival genes by promoting WNT/β-CATENIN and AKT/GSK3β proliferative signaling and that its inhibition induces lymphoma cell death, which warrants further clinical evaluation.

WNTs are secreted glycoproteins rich in cysteine that activate receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Four different pathways are activated by WNT signaling: the canonical WNT/β-CATENIN cascade; the noncanonical planar cell polarity; WNT/Ca2+; and protein kinase A pathways (25Mosimann C. Hausmann G. Basler K. β-Catenin hits chromatin: regulation of Wnt target gene activation.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Binding of WNT molecules to a cognate receptor composed of a seven-pass transmembrane Frizzled receptor and associated single-pass, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related (LRP5/6) proteins located on the cell surface can, in the canonical (WNT/β-CATENIN) pathway, activate intracellular Disheveled protein and recruit AXIN proteins to the cellular membrane. Consequently, the AXIN–APC–GSK3β–CK1α destruction complex becomes inactive, and cytosolic levels of β-CATENIN increase, which in turn leads to translocation of β-CATENIN into the nucleus. Upon entering the nucleus, β-CATENIN interacts with members of the T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) transcription factor family as well as B-cell CLL/lymphoma 9 (BCL9) and Pygopus, displaces GROUCHO/transducin-like enhancer of split/HDAC1 repressor proteins, and stimulates target gene expression through recruitment of chromatin remodelers such as CBP/p300, MLL1/MLL2, and BRG1 (20Logan C.Y.

Dysregulation of the WNT/β-CATENIN–signaling pathway is a hallmark of several types of tumors, including lymphoma, leukemia, colorectal, and hepatocellular carcinoma (28Valenta T. Hausmann G. Basler K. The many faces and functions of β-catenin.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22617422): 2714-273610.1038/emboj.2012.150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Although it is known that DNA methylation in the promoter region of WNT/β-CATENIN antagonists results in their transcriptional silencing, and is associated with activation of β-CATENIN/TCF/LEF target genes and tumor development, little is known about the role played by PRMT5 in this process. Using patient-derived NHL cell lines, we show that PRMT5 promotes WNT/β-CATENIN signaling through direct transcriptional repression of two major antagonists, AXIN2 and WIF1, and indirect activation of AKT/GSK3β signaling. PRMT5 inhibition with either short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown or a PRMT5-specific inhibitor, compound 5 (CMP-5), leads to AXIN2 and WIF1 re-expression as well as inactivation of phospho-AKT (Thr-450 and Ser-473) and reactivation of GSK3β. The net outcome of these molecular changes is decreased expression of the WNT/β-CATENIN target genes CYCLIN D1, c-MYC, and SURVIVIN and induced lymphoma cell death. Recruitment studies show that PRMT5 inhibition results in loss of H3(Me2)R8 and H4(Me2)R3 methylation marks in the promoter region of AXIN2 and WIF1. In addition, remarkable changes occur at the CYCLIN D1, c-MYC, and SURVIVIN promoters, which consist of a decrease in recruitment of co-activators CBP, p300, and MLL1, and loss of their induced epigenetic marks H3K9Ac, H3K14Ac, and H3(Me3)K4, which is accompanied by enhanced binding of co-repressors HDAC2 and LSD1. These results have also been confirmed in NHL patient samples and mouse primary lymphoma cells. Therefore, our work identifies PRMT5 as a novel regulator of the AKT/GSK3β and WNT/β-CATENIN–signaling pathways in cells derived from multiple lymphoma histologic subtypes, and it further validates the importance of targeting PRMT5 in aggressive lymphomas. We have previously shown that PRMT5 protein levels are low in normal B cells and that its levels are enhanced as a result of decreased expression of specific miRNAs (10Pal S. Baiocchi R.A. Byrd J.C.

We have also reported previously that PRMT5 promotes lymphoma cell growth and survival through inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor proteins, RB1 and RBL2, and up-regulation of the PRC2 (12Chung J. Karkhanis V. Tae S. Yan F. Smith P. Ayers L.W. Agostinelli C. Pileri S. Denis G.V. Baiocchi R.A. Sif S.

Our previous work also showed that although RB1 inhibition is due to hyperphosphorylation by CYCLIN D1–CDK4/CDK6, RBL2 inactivation is a direct result of PRMT5-mediated epigenetic silencing. In addition, evaluation of protein levels revealed a strong correlation between increased PRMT5 expression and elevated levels of CYCLIN D1, a known WNT/β-CATENIN target gene (12Chung J. Karkhanis V. Tae S. Yan F. Smith P. Ayers L.W. Agostinelli C. Pileri S. Denis G.V. Baiocchi R.A. Sif S.

In light of these results and findings, which show that PRMT5 is essential for c-MYC–driven oncogenesis (29Li Y. Chitnis N. Nakagawa H. Kita Y. Natsugoe S. Yang Y. Li Z. Wasik M. Klein-Szanto A.J. Rustgi A.K. Diehl J.A. PRMT5 is required for lymphomagenesis triggered by multiple oncogenic drivers.Cancer Discov. 2015; 5 (25582697): 288-30310.1158/2159-8290.CD-14-0625Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that PRMT5 might affect lymphoma cell growth and proliferation by promoting WNT/β-CATENIN signaling. To verify whether PRMT5 is involved in regulating WNT/β-CATENIN signaling, we measured the mRNA and protein levels of WNT/β-CATENIN downstream target genes, CYCLIN D1, c-MYC, and SURVIVIN (Fig. 1). Two distinct patient-derived cell lines were used to assess the relationship between PRMT5 and WNT/β-CATENIN target genes in each of the three different lymphoma cell types selected, including MCL (Mino and JeKo), GCB-DLBCL (Pfeiffer and Toledo), and ABC-DLBCL (SUDHL-2 and OCI-Ly3). We found that although there was no significant change in β-CATENIN mRNA and protein expression in both normal and transformed B cells, there was an increase in CYCLIN D1 (1.7–2.5-fold, p < 10−3), c-MYC (2–3.3-fold, p < 10−3), and SURVIVIN (3–4-fold, p < 10−3) mRNA levels as well as protein expression in transformed B cells compared with control normal resting or activated CD19+ B cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Consistent with our previous findings, PRMT5 protein levels were also elevated in all three lymphoma cell types. Interestingly, the positive correlation between PRMT5 protein expression and enhanced levels of WNT/Β-CATENIN target genes was paralleled by an increase in the amount of nuclear and transcriptionally active phospho-β-CATENIN (Ser-675) (Fig. 1C), suggesting that PRMT5 promotes lymphoma cell growth and survival via activation of the WNT/β-CATENIN–signaling pathway. To investigate the extent to which PRMT5 influences WNT/β-CATENIN target gene expression, we inhibited its expression by shRNA-mediated knockdown in JeKo, Pfeiffer, and SUDHL-2 cells and monitored mRNA and protein expression of CYCLIN D1, c-MYC, and SURVIVIN. We had previously shown that PRMT5 knockdown using two distinct shRNAs (shPRMT5-1 and shPRMT5-2) achieves similar reduction in PRMT5 mRNA and protein levels (12Chung J. Karkhanis V. Tae S. Yan F. Smith P. Ayers L.W. Agostinelli C. Pileri S. Denis G.V. Baiocchi R.A. Sif S. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) inhibition induces lymphoma cell death through reactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor pathway and polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) silencing.J.

Both mRNA and protein analyses showed that reduced PRMT5 expression results in repression of CYCLIN D1 (3–5-fold, p < 10−3), c-MYC (2.3–3-fold, p < 10−3), and SURVIVIN (26–50-fold, p < 10−4) mRNA levels as well as protein expression in all three lymphoma cell types compared with control uninfected lymphoma cells or lymphoma cells infected with lentivirus that expresses control shGFP (Fig. 1, D and E). To further confirm these results, we used the PRMT5-specific inhibitor, compound 5 (CMP-5), which has recently been characterized (13Alinari L. Mahasenan K.V. Yan F. Karkhanis V. Chung J.H. Smith E.M. Quinion C. Smith P.L. Kim L. Patton J.T. Lapalombella R. Yu B. Wu Y. Roy S. De Leo A. et al.Selective inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 blocks initiation and maintenance of B-cell transformation.Blood. 2015; 125 (25742700): 2530-254310.1182/blood-2014-12-619783Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), to treat JeKo, Pfeiffer, and SUDHL-2 cell lines (Fig. S1, A and B). In agreement with the PRMT5 knockdown experiments, there was a clear decrease in CYCLIN D1, c-MYC, and SURVIVIN mRNA and protein expression in all three lymphoma cell types, but not in control lymphoma cells treated with either DMSO or control CMP-6. Furthermore, when we analyzed proliferation and survival of JeKo, Pfeiffer, and SUDHL-2 cells treated with CMP-5, there was a clear inhibition of cell growth by day 2, which became maximal by day 6, and culminated in enhanced cell death in all three lymphoma cell types as evidenced by the increase in the number of annexin V-positive cells (Fig. S1, C and D). Collectively, these results show that PRMT5 controls expression of prosurvival factors, CYCLIN D1, c-MYC, and SURVIVIN, and that its inhibition results in their suppression and induced lymphoma cell death. Given the importance of WNT/β-CATENIN signaling in the regulation of cellular growth and proliferation, we wanted to determine whether PRMT5 was directly involved in controlling expression of pathway antagonists. To evaluate the genome-wide distribution of PRMT5, ChIP-Seq assay was carried out using immune anti-H3(Me2)R8 antibody to immunoprecipitate cross-linked chromatin from Pfeiffer cells. Among the common target genes identified (Table S1), we found increased H3R8 methylation in the promoter region (−2 to +1 kb) of AXIN1, AXIN2, and WIF1 compared with control input DNA (Fig. 2A). To confirm the ChIP-Seq results, ChIP assays followed by real-time PCR analyses were conducted on cross-linked chromatin immunoprecipitated from the three lymphoma cell lines using either pre-immune or immune anti-PRMT5, anti-H3(Me2)R8, and anti-H4(Me2)R3 (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2, A and B). Consistent with the ChIP-Seq results, there was 2–3-fold (p < 10−4) increased PRMT5 recruitment and enrichment of its epigenetic marks in the promoter region of AXIN1, AXIN2, and WIF1. Moreover, inspection of the amplified region in the promoter region of all three WNT/β-CATENIN antagonists revealed that there are conserved DNA-binding sites for p53, PAX5, TFII-I, and estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) transcription factor (Table S2). In light of these results, we proceeded to evaluate mRNA and protein expression of WNT/β-CATENIN antagonists in both control resting or activated B cells and transformed B-cell lines (Fig. 2, C and D). Both AXIN2 and WIF1 mRNAs and proteins exhibited 2–20-fold (p < 10−3) reduced expression profiles in lymphoma cells compared with control B cells, whereas AXIN1 mRNA and protein levels were unaffected in normal and transformed B ce"
https://openalex.org/W2921628574,"The tumour suppressor p53 (encoded by TP53) protects the genome against cellular stress and is frequently mutated in cancer. Mutant p53 acquires gain-of-function oncogenic activities that are dependent on its enhanced stability. However, the mechanisms by which nuclear p53 is stabilized are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the stability of stress-induced wild-type and mutant p53 is regulated by the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKI-α (also known as PIP5K1A)) and its product phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2). Nuclear PIPKI-α binds to p53 upon stress, resulting in the production and association of PtdIns(4,5)P2 with p53. PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding promotes the interaction between p53 and the small heat shock proteins HSP27 (also known as HSPB1) and αB-crystallin (also known as HSPB5), which stabilize nuclear p53. Moreover, inhibition of PIPKI-α or PtdIns(4,5)P2 association results in p53 destabilization. Our results point to a previously unrecognized role of nuclear phosphoinositide signalling in regulating p53 stability and implicate this pathway as a promising therapeutic target in cancer."

Up to 26,005 participants completed at least one of two follow-up assessments of PM, Pairs, FI and RT. Multivariable regression models examined the association between age (<45[reference], 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65+) and cognition scores at baseline. Mixed models estimated the impact of age on cognitive decline over follow-up (~5.1 years).FI was higher between ages 50 and 64 and lower at 65+ compared to <45 at baseline. Performance on all other baseline tests was lower with older age: with increasing age category, difference in test scores ranged from 2.5 to 7.8%(P<0.0001). Compared to <45 at baseline, RT and Pairs performance declined faster across all older age cohorts (3.0 and 1.2% change, respectively, with increasing age category, P<0.0001). Cross-sectional results yielded 8 to 12-fold higher differences in RT and Pairs with age compared to longitudinal results.Our findings suggest that declines in cognitive abilities <65 are small. The cross-sectional differences in cognition scores for middle to older adult years may be due in part to age cohort effects."
https://openalex.org/W2921676924,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with impaired major domains of psychology and behavior. Individuals with PTSD also have increased co-morbidity with several serious medical conditions, including autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, raising the possibility that systemic pathology associated with PTSD might be identified by metabolomic analysis of blood. We sought to identify metabolites that are altered in male combat veterans with PTSD. In this case-control study, we compared metabolomic profiles from age-matched male combat trauma-exposed veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts with PTSD (n = 52) and without PTSD (n = 51) (‘Discovery group’). An additional group of 31 PTSD-positive and 31 PTSD-negative male combat-exposed veterans was used for validation of these findings (‘Test group’). Plasma metabolite profiles were measured in all subjects using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. We identified key differences between PTSD subjects and controls in pathways related to glycolysis and fatty acid uptake and metabolism in the initial ‘Discovery group’, consistent with mitochondrial alterations or dysfunction, which were also confirmed in the ‘Test group’. Other pathways related to urea cycle and amino acid metabolism were different between PTSD subjects and controls in the ‘Discovery’ but not in the smaller ‘Test’ group. These metabolic differences were not explained by comorbid major depression, body mass index, blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, smoking, or use of analgesics, antidepressants, statins, or anti-inflammatories. These data show replicable, wide-ranging changes in the metabolic profile of combat-exposed males with PTSD, with a suggestion of mitochondrial alterations or dysfunction, that may contribute to the behavioral and somatic phenotypes associated with this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2923173041,"It is generally accepted that alterations in metabolism are critical for the metastatic process; however, the mechanisms by which these metabolic changes are controlled by the major drivers of the metastatic process remain elusive. Here, we found that S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4), a major metastasis-promoting protein, confers metabolic plasticity to drive tumor invasion and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer cells. Investigating how S100A4 regulates metabolism, we found that S100A4 depletion decreases oxygen consumption rates, mitochondrial activity, and ATP production and also shifts cell metabolism to higher glycolytic activity. We further identified that the 49-kDa mitochondrial complex I subunit NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 2 (NDUFS2) is regulated in an S100A4-dependent manner and that S100A4 and NDUFS2 exhibit co-occurrence at significant levels in various cancer types as determined by database-driven analysis of genomes in clinical samples using cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. Importantly, we noted that S100A4 or NDUFS2 silencing inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, reduces cellular ATP level, decreases invasive capacity in three-dimensional growth, and dramatically decreases metastasis rates as well as tumor growth in vivo Finally, we provide evidence that cells depleted in S100A4 or NDUFS2 shift their metabolism toward glycolysis by up-regulating hexokinase expression and that suppressing S100A4 signaling sensitizes lung cancer cells to glycolysis inhibition. Our findings uncover a novel S100A4 function and highlight its importance in controlling NDUFS2 expression to regulate the plasticity of mitochondrial metabolism and thereby promote the invasive and metastatic capacity in lung cancer."

The goal of the study was to examine the possibility of plasma cytokines for the screening of colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods We carried out a multicenter, hospital-based case-control study in 66 adult Japanese patients with CRC and 87 healthy adult Japanese. A multiplex bead array immunoassay was used to examine 27 different plasma cytokines. Their association with the presence of CRC was evaluated by logistic regression analysis after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Results Thirteen plasma cytokines were notably associated with the presence of CRC (p< 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the combinatorial assessment of some of these plasma cytokines showed “good” capability for discriminating between CRC patients and control subjects (area under the curve (AUC): 0.819 for the combination of IL-9, Eotaxin, G-CSF, and TNF-α; 0.832 for the combination of IL-4, IL-8, Eotaxin, IP-10, and TNF-α). Individual cytokine assessments presented lower AUCs (0.657–0.755) than the combinatorial cytokine assessments. Conclusions The levels of several plasma cytokines varied significantly between CRC patients and control subjects, suggesting the possibility of differentially expressed plasma cytokines as potential biomarkers for detecting the presence of CRC. Our results should be validated in other populations."

Our previous study showed that LPLUNC1 upregulates Prohibitin 1 (PHB1), a pleiotropic protein that functions as a tumour suppressor gene in various cancers. Low expression of PHB1 was also found to be associated with the poor prognosis of NPC patients. However, the mechanisms by which LPLUNC1 upregulates PHB1 and the potential role of PHB1 in NPC are unclear. Here, we found that LPLUNC1 stabilised PHB1 by inhibiting PHB1 ubiquitination, which is mediated by E3 ligase TRIM21. LPLUNC1 competitively impaired the binding of PHB1 to TRIM21 due to its stronger binding affinity to PHB1, suppressing the ubiquitination of PHB1. Therefore, our study indicates that PHB1 acted as a tumour suppressor gene by inhibiting NF-κB activity. Depletion of PHB1 significantly attenuated the anti-tumour effects of LPLUNC1 in NPC cells, and the inhibitory effect of LPLUNC1 on NF-κB activity was thus reversed. Together, our findings revealed a novel mechanism underlying the anticancer effect of LPLUNC1 and clarified that PHB1 may represent a novel, promising candidate tumour suppressor gene in NPC, with potential therapeutic target value."

Purpose This study determined if carbohydrate intake during prolonged and intensive cycling countered post-exercise increases in n-6 and n-3 PUFA-derived oxylipins. Methods The research design utilized a randomized, crossover, counterbalanced approach with cyclists (N = 20, overnight fasted state, 7:00 am start) who engaged in four 75-km time trials while ingesting two types of bananas (Cavendish, Mini-yellow), a 6% sugar beverage, and water only. Carbohydrate intake was set at 0.2 g/kg every 15 minutes, and blood samples were collected pre-exercise and 0 h-, 0.75 h-,1.5 h-, 3 h-, 4.5 h-, 21 h-, 45 h-post-exercise. Oxylipins were measured with a targeted liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometric method. Results Significant time effects and substantial fold-increases (immediately post-exercise/pre-exercise) were measured for plasma levels of arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and 43 of 45 oxylipins. Significant interaction effects (4 trials x 8 time points) were found for plasma ARA (P<0.001) and DHA (P<0.001), but not EPA (P = 0.255), with higher post-exercise values found in the water trial compared to the carbohydrate trials. Significant interaction effects were also measured for 12 of 45 oxylipins. The data supported a strong exercise-induced increase in plasma levels of these oxylipins during the water trial, with carbohydrate ingestion (both bananas types and the sugar beverage) attenuating oxylipin increases, especially those (9 of 12) generated from the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzyme system. These trials differences were especially apparent within the first three hours of recovery from the 75-km cycling bout. Conclusions Prolonged and intensive exercise evoked a transient but robust increase in plasma levels of oxylipins, with a significant attenuation effect linked to acute carbohydrate ingestion for 28% of these, especially those generated through the CYP enzyme system.

Finally, yes-associated protein (YAP) activation, a major driver of fibrosis, increased after UUO injury and was diminished by EDP-305 treatment. Consistently, EDP-305 decreased TGF-β1-induced YAP nuclear localization in human kidney 2 cells by increasing inhibitory YAP phosphorylation. YAP inhibition may be a novel antifibrotic mechanism of FXR agonism, and EDP-305 could be used to treat renal fibrosis.-Li, S., Ghoshal, S., Sojoodi, M., Arora, G., Masia, R., Erstad, D.

https://openalex.org/W2921075350,"Fetal cardiomyocytes shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation around the time of birth. Myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 (MEIS1) is a transcription factor that promotes glycolysis in hematopoietic stem cells. We reasoned that MEIS1 could have a similar role in the developing heart. We hypothesized that suppression of MEIS1 expression in fetal sheep cardiomyocytes leads to a metabolic switch as found at birth. Expression of MEIS1 was assayed in left ventricular cardiac tissue and primary cultures of cardiomyocytes from fetal (100- and 135-d gestation, term = 145 d), neonatal, and adult sheep. Cultured cells were treated with short interfering RNA (siRNA) to suppress MEIS1. Oxygen consumption rate was assessed with the Seahorse metabolic flux analyzer, and mitochondrial activity was assessed by staining cells with MitoTracker Orange. Cardiomyocyte respiratory capacity increased with advancing age concurrently with decreased expression of MEIS1. MEIS1 suppression with siRNA increased maximal oxygen consumption in fetal cells but not in postnatal cells. Mitochondrial activity was increased and expression of glycolytic genes decreased when MEIS1 expression was suppressed. Thus, we conclude that MEIS1 is a key regulator of cardiomyocyte metabolism and that the normal down-regulation of MEIS1 with age underlies a gradual switch to oxidative metabolism.-Lindgren, I. M., Drake, R. R., Chattergoon, N. N., Thornburg, K. L. Down-regulation of MEIS1 promotes the maturation of oxidative phosphorylation in perinatal cardiomyocytes."

This study aimed to evaluate the association of breathlessness with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) events, cardiac events and all-cause mortality from middle-age throughout life. Methods Breathlessness was measured in 699, 55-year old men residing in Malmö, Sweden using modified Medical Research Council (mMRC). COPD events (hospitalisation, death or diagnosis) cardiac events and all-cause mortality was assessed using The Swedish Causes of Death Register and Hospital Discharge Register. Data was analyzed using Cox- and competing risks (Fine-Gray) regression analysis. Results 695 (99%) of 699 participants died and four emigrated during follow up. Eighty-seven (12%) had mMRC = 1 and 19 (3%) had mMRC≥2. Breathlessness was associated with COPD events; adjusted Sub-Hazard Ratio 2.1 (95% CI, 1.2–3.6) for mMRC = 1 and 7.5 (2.6–21.7) for mMRC ≥ 2 but not associated with cardiac events when adjusting for competing events and confounding. Breathlessness was associated increased all- cause mortality (Hazard Ratios of 1.4 (1.1–1.7) (mMRC = 1) and 3.4 (2.1–5.6) (mMRC ≥ 2)). Conclusion Breathlessness is associated with increased risk of COPD events and increase in all-cause mortality from age 55 until death."
https://openalex.org/W2922915463,"A critical function of the PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)-Parkin pathway is to mediate the clearing of unhealthy or damaged mitochondria via mitophagy. Loss of either PINK1 or Parkin protein expression is associated with Parkinson's disease. Here, using a high-throughput screening approach along with recombinant protein expression and kinase, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence live-cell imaging assays, we report that celastrol, a pentacyclic triterpenoid isolated from extracts of the medicinal plant Tripterygium wilfordii, blocks recruitment pof Parkin to mitochondria, preventing mitophagy in response to mitochondrial depolarization induced by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone or to gamitrinib-induced inhibition of mitochondrial heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Celastrol's effect on mitophagy was independent of its known role in microtubule disruption. Instead, we show that celastrol suppresses Parkin recruitment by inactivating PINK1 and preventing it from phosphorylating Parkin and also ubiquitin. We also observed that PINK1 directly and strongly associates with TOM20, a component of the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) machinery and relatively weak binding to another TOM subunit, TOM70. Moreover, celastrol disrupted binding between PINK1 and TOM20 both in vitro and in vivo but did not affect binding between TOM20 and TOM70. Using native gel analysis, we also show that celastrol disrupts PINK1 complex formation upon mitochondrial depolarization and sequesters PINK1 to high-molecular-weight protein aggregates. These results reveal that celastrol regulates the mitochondrial quality control pathway by interfering with PINK1-TOM20 binding."
https://openalex.org/W2922367753,"Primary cilia of renal epithelial cells express several members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) class of cation-conducting channel, including TRPC1, TRPM3, TRPM4, TRPP2, and TRPV4. Some cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) are caused by defects in TRPP2 (also called polycystin-2, PC2, or PKD2). A large-conductance, TRPP2-dependent channel in renal cilia has been well described, but it is not known whether this channel includes any other protein subunits. To study this question, we investigated the pharmacology of the TRPP2-dependent channel through electrical recordings from the cilia of mIMCD-3 cells, a murine cell line of renal epithelial origin. The pharmacology was found to match that of TRPM3 channels. The ciliary TRPP2-dependent channel is known to be activated by depolarization and by increasing cytoplasmic Ca2+. This activation was greatly enhanced by external pregnenolone sulfate, an agonist of TRPM3 channels. Pregnenolone sulfate did not change the single-channel current-voltage relation. The channels were effectively blocked by isosakuranetin, a specific inhibitor of TRPM3 channels. Both pregnenolone sulfate and isosakuranetin were effective at concentrations as low as 1 μM. Knocking out TRPM3 by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing eliminated the ciliary channel. Thus the channel is both TRPM3-dependent and TRPP2-dependent, suggesting that it may include both types of subunit. Knocking out TRPM3 did not change the level of TRPP2 protein in the cilia, so it is unlikely that the absence of functional ciliary channels results from a failure of trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2921525444,"Background Worldwide, overweight and obesity rates have more than tripled over the past three decades. Overweight and obesity rates are particularly high among Latinos. In order to determine some of the potential reasons, it is imperative to investigate how first-generation Latina mothers living in non-metropolitan and small metro areas decide how and what to feed their children. Using the Socio-Ecological Model, this study aimed to understand how Latina immigrant mothers make feeding decisions for their children. Methods A total of 29 semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of immigrant mothers from Latin American countries whose preschoolers were enrolled in a Women, Infant, and Children supplemental nutrition program located in non-metropolitan and small metro areas. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim in Spanish, and analyzed by a bilingual team. Results Multi-stage qualitative analysis was employed to analyze the data. Nineteen participants originated from Mexico, four from Central America, and six from South America. Five themes emerged that helped illuminate mother’s decision-making around feeding choices: 1) culture as all-encompassing, 2) location and access to fresh and traditional foods, 3) disjunction between health provider advice and cultural knowledge 4) responsiveness to family needs and wants as determinants of food choices, 5) intrapersonal conflict stemming from childhood poverty and food insufficiency. Conclusion Findings suggest that Latina immigrant mothers engage in a difficult and even conflicting process when deciding how to feed their children. Future interventions should focus on implementing hands-on activities that can help consolidate, promote, and encourage healthy feeding choices."
https://openalex.org/W2920953220,"Background Large proportions of the populations in many European countries, including Germany, are migrants. Migrant children and adolescents tend to be less physically active than their non-migrant peers. However, current research is limited as it does not sufficiently consider different domains of physical activity. Using a representative dataset, the present study examines the patterns of sports participation and other domains of physical activity among migrant and non-migrant children and adolescents residing in Germany. Methods Nationwide data from the Motorik-Modul (MoMo) Study is used. Five different domains of physical activity participation (sports clubs, outside of sports clubs, extra-curricular physical activity, physical activity, outdoor play and active commuting to school) were compared between children and adolescents with no, one-sided and two-sided migration background using logistic regression adjusted for demographic factors. Interaction terms were included in order to examine whether difference between the three groups differ by age and gender. Results Information on n = 3,323 children and adolescents was available. As compared to non-migrants, children and adolescents with a two-sided migration background had a 40% (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.60, 95%-CI: 0.44–0.81), those with a one-sided migration background a 26% (aOR = 0.74, 95%-CI: 0.55-<1.00) lower chance of participating in sport club activities. In contrast, children and adolescents with a two-sided migration background were at 65% higher chance of participating in extra-curricular physical activity than non-migrants (OR = 1.65, 95%-CI: 1.15–2.36). Conclusion The study shows that differences in levels of physical activity between migrant and non-migrant children and adolescents are less pronounced than previous research has suggested. In particular, it reveals that migrants are only disadvantaged regarding participation in sports clubs whereas they fare better with respect to extra-curricular physical activity. Interventions should therefore address barriers migrant children and adolescents encounter in the access to sport clubs while maintaining their high level of extra-curricular physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2922897002,"Osteoblasts are versatile cells involved in multiple whole-body processes, including bone formation and immune response. Secretory amounts and patterns of osteoblast-derived proteins such as osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN) modulate osteoblast function. However, the regulatory mechanism of OPN and OCN expression remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that p54/p46 c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibition suppresses matrix mineralization and OCN expression but increases OPN expression in MC3T3-E1 cells and primary osteoblasts treated with differentiation inducers, including ascorbic acid, bone morphogenic protein-2, or fibroblast growth factor 2. Preinhibition of JNK before the onset of differentiation increased the number of osteoblasts that highly express OPN but not OCN (OPN-OBs), indicating that JNK affects OPN secretory phenotype at the early stage of osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, we identified JNK2 isoform as being critically involved in OPN-OB differentiation. Microarray analysis revealed that OPN-OBs express characteristic transcription factors, cell surface markers, and cytokines, including glycoprotein hormone α2 and endothelial cell–specific molecule 1. Moreover, we found that inhibitor of DNA binding 4 is an important regulator of OPN-OB differentiation and that dual-specificity phosphatase 16, a JNK-specific phosphatase, functions as an endogenous regulator of OPN-OB induction. OPN-OB phenotype was also observed following LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis stimulation during osteogenic differentiation. Collectively, these results suggest that the JNK-Id4 signaling axis is crucial in the control of OPN and OCN expression during osteoblastic differentiation.—Kusuyama, J., Amir, M. S., Albertson, B.

https://openalex.org/W2921841124,"Uncontrolled proliferation of endothelial cells is essential to the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Both proliferation and cytoskeleton reorganization are associated with upregulation of the intermediate filament protein Nestin. Recently, accumulation of Nestin-expressing cells was found in pulmonary vascular lesions of PAH patients. The goal of this study is to determine if Nestin expression contributes to endothelial proliferation in pulmonary arterial hypertension, using both lung tissues and endothelial cells. Here we found that endothelial cells from complex and plexiform lesions of PAH patients expressed Nestin. These Nestin+ cells further stained positive for the angiogenic factors CXC chemokine ligand 12 and Wnt1. Likewise, in the chronic hypoxia/SU5416 animal model of pulmonary hypertension, Nestin+ endothelial cells were found in occlusive pulmonary vascular lesions. In vitro, both growing rat and human lung endothelial cells expressed Nestin protein. When Nestin was overexpressed in endothelial cells (both rat and human), Nestin overexpression promoted proliferation and expression of CXC chemokine ligand 12. Nestin overexpression further increased angiogenic tube formation in vitro. Conclusions: We found increased Nestin expression from endothelial cells of occlusive lung vascular lesions in severe pulmonary hypertension. Elevated Nestin expression likely contributes to unchecked pulmonary vascular proliferation and angiogenesis, possibly via induction of CXC chemokine ligand 12. Additional studies are required to determine whether targeting Nestin would be beneficial to treat PAH."
https://openalex.org/W2920803727,"Background Although the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score was recently introduced to identify patients with suspected infection/sepsis, it has limitations as a predictive tool for adverse outcomes. We hypothesized that combining qSOFA score with heart rate variability (HRV) variables improves predictive ability for mortality in septic patients at the emergency department (ED). Methods This was a retrospective study using the electronic medical record of a tertiary care hospital in Singapore between September 2014 and February 2017. All patients aged 21 years or older who were suspected with infection/sepsis in the ED and received electrocardiography monitoring with ZOLL X Series Monitor (ZOLL Medical Corporation, Chelmsford, MA) were included. We fitted a logistic regression model to predict the 30-day mortality using one of the HRV variables selected from one of each three domains those previously reported as strong association with mortality (i.e. standard deviation of NN [SDNN], ratio of low frequency to high frequency power [LF/HF], detrended fluctuation analysis α-2 [DFA α-2]) in addition to the qSOFA score. The predictive accuracy was assessed with other scoring systems (i.e. qSOFA alone, National Early Warning Score, and Modified Early Warning Score) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results A total of 343 septic patients were included. Non-survivors were significantly older (survivors vs. non-survivors, 65.7 vs. 72.9, p <0.01) and had higher qSOFA (0.8 vs. 1.4, p <0.01) as compared to survivors. There were significant differences in HRV variables between survivors and non-survivors including SDNN (23.7s vs. 31.8s, p = 0.02), LF/HF (2.8 vs. 1.5, p = 0.02), DFA α-2 (1.0 vs. 0.7, P < 0.01). Our prediction model using DFA-α-2 had the highest c-statistic of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.82), followed by qSOFA of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.75), National Early Warning Score at 0.67 (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.74), and Modified Early Warning Score at 0.59 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.67). Conclusions Adding DFA-α-2 to the qSOFA score may improve the accuracy of predicting in-hospital mortality in septic patients who present to the ED. Further multicenter prospective studies are required to confirm our results."
https://openalex.org/W2922130949,"Development of physiologic cardiac hypertrophy has primarily been ascribed to the IGF-1 and its receptor, IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and subsequent activation of the protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. However, regulation of endosome-mediated recycling and degradation of IGF-1R during physiologic hypertrophy has not been investigated. In a physiologic hypertrophy model of treadmill-exercised mice, we observed that levels of tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101), a key member of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport, were dramatically elevated in the heart compared with sedentary controls. To determine the role of Tsg101 on physiologic hypertrophy, we generated a transgenic (TG) mouse model with cardiac-specific overexpression of Tsg101. These TG mice exhibited a physiologic-like cardiac hypertrophy phenotype at 8 wk evidenced by: 1) the absence of cardiac fibrosis, 2) significant improvement of cardiac function, and 3) increased total and plasma membrane levels of IGF-1R and increased phosphorylation of Akt. Mechanistically, we identified that Tsg101 interacted with family-interacting protein 3 (FIP3) and IGF-1R, thereby stabilizing FIP3 and enhancing recycling of IGF-1R. In vitro, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Tsg101 in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes resulted in cell hypertrophy, which was blocked by addition of monensin, an inhibitor of endosome-mediated recycling, and by small interfering RNA—mediated knockdown (KD) of FIP3. Furthermore, cardiac-specific KD of Tsg101 showed a significant reduction in levels of endosomal recycling compartment members (Rabila and FIP3), IGF-1R, and Akt phosphorylation. Most interestingly, Tsg101-KD mice failed to develop cardiac hypertrophy after intense treadmill training. Taken together, our data identify Tsg101 as a novel positive regulator of physiologic cardiac hypertrophy through facilitating the FIP3-mediated endosomal recycling of IGF-1R.—Essandoh, K., Deng, S., Wang, X., Jiang, M., Mu, X., Peng, J., Li, Y., Peng, T., Wagner, K.-U., Rubinstein, J., Fan, G.-C.

Because E3 ubiquitin ligases are the primary determinants of substrate specificity within the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of proteins, we first sought to identify the E3 ligase associated with Tat degradation. Based on the intrinsic disordered nature of Tat protein, we focused our attention on host cell E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (C terminus of HSP70-binding protein). Co-transfection of Tat with a CHIP-expressing plasmid decreased the levels of Tat protein in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting the corresponding mRNA levels. Additionally, the rate of Tat protein degradation as measured by cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay was increased in the presence of CHIP. A CHIP mutant lacking the U-box domain, which is responsible for protein ubiquitination (CHIPΔU-box), was unable to degrade Tat protein. Furthermore, CHIP promoted ubiquitination of Tat by both WT as well as Lys-48–ubiquitin, which has only a single lysine residue at position 48. CHIP transfection in HIV-1 reporter TZM-bl cells resulted in decreased Tat-dependent HIV-1 long-terminal repeat (LTR) promoter transactivation as well as HIV-1 virion production.

https://openalex.org/W2925263694,"Cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNG) channels produce the initial electrical signal in mammalian vision and olfaction. They open in response to direct binding of cyclic nucleotide (cAMP or cGMP) to a cytoplasmic region of the channel. However, the conformational rearrangements occurring upon binding to produce pore opening (i.e. gating) are not well understood. SthK is a bacterial CNG channel that has the potential to serve as an ideal model for structure–function studies of gating but is currently limited by its toxicity, native cysteines, and low open probability (Po). Here, we expressed SthK in giant Escherichia coli spheroplasts and performed patch-clamp recordings to characterize SthK gating in a bacterial membrane. We demonstrated that the Po in cAMP is higher than has been previously published and that cGMP acts as a weak partial SthK agonist. Additionally, we determined that SthK expression is toxic to E. coli because of gating by cytoplasmic cAMP. We overcame this toxicity by developing an adenylate cyclase–knockout E. coli cell line. Finally, we generated a cysteine-free SthK construct and introduced mutations that further increase the Po in cAMP. We propose that this SthK model will help elucidate the gating mechanism of CNG channels."

Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis was performed to identify the genotypes of the rs2241766 (exon 2) and rs1501299 (intron 2) ADIPOQ polymorphisms. Corporal composition and biochemical markers included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.Patients with DIBC had higher serum glucose, WC and WHR than controls. Intergroup differences in allele and genotype frequencies were found for both polymorphisms (P < 0.05). Patients carrying the rs2241766 TT and TG genotypes had higher values of WC, HC and WHR, but only TG carriers had higher levels of glucose. For the SNP rs1501299, carriers of the GG genotype in the DIBC group had higher values of glucose, WC, HC and WHR than the respective control group.These results suggest that WC, HC and WHR are better predictors of DIBC than BMI. The ADIPOQ SNP rs2241766 emerges as a protective factor, whereas rs1501299 is a risk factor for DIBC development in a Mexican population."

We recorded via electromagnetic articulometry speech movements in sequences of the form /CV…/ from nine speakers (five German, four English) speaking at eight distinct rates. First, we demonstrate that the paradigm of metronome-driven manipulations results in speech movement data consistent with earlier reports on the kinematics of speech production. Second, analysis of our data in their full three-dimensions and using advanced numerical differentiation methods offers stronger evidence for the law than that reported in previous studies devoted to its assessment. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of a clear rate dependency of the power law's parameters. The robustness of the speed-curvature relation in our datasets lends further support to the hypothesis that the power law is a general feature of human movement. We place our results in the context of other work in movement control and consider implications for models of speech production."

This study aimed to investigate whether biomarkers are associated with aortic dimensions in patients enrolled in the Genetically-Triggered Thoracic Aortic Conditions (GenTAC) registry. Methods Plasma samples of 159 patients enrolled in the GenTAC registry were assessed for circulating biomarkers [interleukin-6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1)]. Association of circulating biomarker levels with aortic dimensions was investigated. Results IL-6 showed significant positive correlations with aortic dimensions at each segment of the aorta, with the correlation increasing in more distal aortic regions (ascending aorta, R = 0.26, p = 0.004; proximal arch, R = 0.35, p<0.0001; transverse arch, R = 0.30, p = 0.0005; mid-descending thoracic aorta, R = 0.40, p<0.0001; thoracoabdominal aorta, R = 0.38, p<0.0001; suprarenal abdominal aorta, R = 0.42, p<0.0001; and infrarenal aorta, R = 0.43, p<0.0001).

One method of methylation removal is through ten–eleven translocation–catalyzed oxidation and the base excision repair pathway. The iterative oxidation of 5-methylcytosine catalyzed by ten–eleven translocation enzymes produces three oxidized forms of cytosine: 5-hydroxmethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxycytosine. The effect these modifications have on the efficiency and fidelity of the base excision repair pathway during the repair of opposing base damage, and in particular DNA polymerization, remains to be elucidated. Using kinetic assays, we show that the catalytic efficiency for the incorporation of dGTP catalyzed by human DNA polymerase β is not affected when 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxmethylcytosine, and 5-formylcytosine are in the DNA template. In contrast, the catalytic efficiency of dGTP insertion decreases ∼20-fold when 5-carboxycytosine is in the templating position, as compared with unmodified cytosine. However, DNA polymerase fidelity is unaltered when these modifications are in the templating position. Structural analysis reveals that the methyl, hydroxymethyl, and formyl modifications are easily accommodated within the polymerase active site. However, to accommodate the carboxyl modification, the phosphate backbone on the templating nucleotide shifts ∼2.5 Å to avoid a potential steric/repulsive clash. This altered conformation is stabilized by lysine 280, which makes a direct interaction with the carboxyl modification and the phosphate backbone of the templating strand.

Cytosine methylation can be erased to allow for differential gene expression. This necessitates demethylation pathways that can either remove the methyl group from the cytosine base or remove the base and replace it with normal cytosine (active demethylation pathway). At this point, an enzyme capable of catalyzing the direct removal of a C5 methyl group from cytosine has not been identified. However, in vivo isotopic labeling studies have suggested the existence of such an enzyme (5Iwan K. Rahimoff R. Kirchner A. Spada F. Schröder A.S. Kosmatchev O. Ferizaj S. Steinbacher J. Parsa E. Müller M. Carell T. 5-Formylcytosine to cytosine conversion by C–C bond cleavage in vivo.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14 (29176672): 72-7810.1038/nchembio.2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the most well-described demethylation pathway involves the removal and replacement of 5mC by action of ten–eleven translocation (TET) enzymes and base excision repair (BER) (6Zhu J.K.

These enzymes oxidize the methyl group on 5C iteratively, forming three intermediates: 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5hmC), 5-formyl cytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxyl cytosine (5caC) (9Ito S. Shen L. Dai Q.

Furthermore, the potential for these modified cytosine bases to alter the activity and fidelity of DNA polymerases during repair and replication has not been quantitatively assessed, and conflicting reports have been published. In general, these modifications in the template base position can have two effects on DNA polymerization. They may reduce the catalytic efficiency of dGTP insertion, and these modifications may alter dNTP selectivity, leading to a decrease in fidelity. It has been hypothesized that the formyl and carboxyl modifications promote the imino tautomeric form of cytosine (23Karino N. Ueno Y. Matsuda A. Synthesis and properties of oligonucleotides containing 5-formyl-2′-deoxycytidine: in vitro DNA polymerase reactions on DNA templates containing 5-formyl-2′-deoxycytidine.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29 (11410651): 2456-246310.1093/nar/29.12.2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The imino form of cytosine is potentially mutagenic because it can form a Watson–Crick base pair with adenine (24Münzel M. Lischke U. Stathis D. Pfaffeneder T. Gnerlich F.A. Deiml C.A. Koch S.C.

However, analytical experiments have revealed that these modifications do not promote the tautomeric form of cytosine and call into question the potential of these bases to encode for adenine insertion into DNA (25Szulik M.W.

Previous replication studies in Escherichia coli using a shuttle vector assay suggested that 5mC and its oxidized forms could induce C-to-T transition mutations at a low frequency (∼0.2–1.1%) (27Xing X.W. Liu Y.L. Vargas M. Wang Y. Feng Y.Q. Zhou X. Yuan B.F.

Another in vivo study, using cos-7 cells, found 5fC to induce C-to-T mutations at a frequency of 0.03–0.28% (28Kamiya H. Tsuchiya H. Karino N. Ueno Y. Matsuda A. Harashima H. Mutagenicity of 5-formylcytosine, an oxidation product of 5-methylcytosine, in DNA in mammalian cells.J Biochem. 2002; 132 (12359069): 551-55510.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a003256Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Qualitative in vitro kinetic studies using DNA polymerases η, κ, and Klenow exo and the DNA template base 5fC revealed a frequency of 1% for the insertion of dATP versus dGTP (24Münzel M. Lischke U. Stathis D. Pfaffeneder T. Gnerlich F.A. Deiml C.A. Koch S.C. Karaghiosoff K. Carell T.

Another qualitative kinetic study revealed that 5mC and its oxidized forms had no effect on insertion of dGTP or dATP with Klenow exo and human pol η, as compared with unmodified templating cytosine (29Shibutani T. Ito S. Toda M. Kanao R. Collins L.B. Shibata M. Urabe M. Koseki H. Masuda Y. Swenberg J.A. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Iwai S. Kuraoka I. Guanine-5-carboxylcytosine base pairs mimic mismatches during DNA replication.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (24910358): 5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To provide clarity to the disparate results observed with DNA polymerases regarding the templating properties of oxidized cytosine, we measured single-turnover and steady-state kinetics of nucleotide insertion by human DNA pol β. The results indicate that the oxidized forms of 5mC do not significantly alter the fidelity of pol β. A series of crystal structures reveal the molecular basis for the accommodation of these epigenetic modifications in the active site of pol β. We first measured the single-turnover rate constants of pol β-catalyzed nucleotide insertion with 1-nt gap DNA substrates containing C, 5mC, 5hmC, 5fC, or 5caC in the templating base position (Fig. 1). In these reactions, pol β and dGTP are at saturating concentrations allowing for the determination of the observed rate constant, kpol. The kpol values are comparable among these varying templating base DNA substrates (Fig. 2 and Table 1), suggesting that the modifications do not alter the rate-limiting step of insertion. Although the kpol values are similar, the reaction amplitudes vary between the substrates (Fig. 2). Longer reaction time points revealed that a fraction of the 5fC (∼25%) and 5caC (∼40%) substrates were not extendable, suggesting that a population of these templates were altered.Figure 2.Single-turnover analysis of pol β–catalyzed nucleotide insertion with modified cytosine templates. The reactions were performed with saturating concentrations of pol β (1 μm), indicated DNA substrate (50 nm), and dGTP (100 μm). The data are fit to a single-exponential equation yielding observed rate constants of 2.8 ± 0.2, 2.9 ± 0.1, 2.7 ± 0.1, 2.6 ± 0.1, and 2.2 ± 0.3 for templating C, 5mC, 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC, respectively. The reported error is from the fit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table 1Single-turnover kinetic summary for the insertion of dGTP opposite indicated templating baseTemplatekpols−1C2.8 ± 0.25mC2.9 ± 0.15hmC2.7 ± 0.15fC2.6 ± 0.15caC2.2 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the cytosine modifications alter the fidelity of pol β, catalytic efficiencies were measured for correct (dGTP) and incorrect (dATP, dTTP, and dCTP) nucleotide insertions. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for nucleotide insertion is a measure of the productive associations between the binary complex (pol β–DNA) and dNTP. Templating bases 5mC, 5hmC, or 5fC did not significantly alter the catalytic efficiencies for insertion of dGTP (Fig. 3 and Table 2). In contrast, templating 5caC decreased the catalytic efficiency of dGTP insertion by ∼20-fold as compared with a 1-nt gap templating C substrate (Fig. 3 and Table 2). DNA polymerase fidelity can be determined by comparing the catalytic efficiencies of the correct insertion to those of incorrect insertion (correct/incorrect). The catalytic efficiencies for misinsertion were measured for each template (Table 2), and the results are shown on a discrimination plot (Fig. 3). The fidelity among the various templates can be visually appreciated by comparing the distance between the correct and incorrect nucleotide insertion on the plot (30Cavanaugh N.A. Beard W.A.

The crystallographic and refinement data statistics are shown in Table S1. First, a binary complex structure of pol β with 5caC in the template position was solved. The structure revealed clear density for the carboxyl group and positioning of the 5caC base in the canonical anti-conformation (Fig. S1). To form a ternary complex, the binary complex crystals were soaked with a nonhydrolyzable dGTP analog, dGP(CH2)PP. Binding of dGP(CH2)PP resulted in pol β undergoing the well-recognized open-to-closed conformational change; Watson–Crick base pairing between the incoming dGP(CH2)PP base and templating 5caC base is observed (Fig. 4). Overlay of ternary complex structures of templating C and 5caC reveals that the 5′ phosphate backbone of the 5caC templating base is repositioned (Fig. 4). This repositioning of the phosphate backbone is a consequence of the repulsion between the 5-carboxylic group and nonbridging oxygen of the templating phosphate. Lysine 280 is positioned to make electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions with the 5-carboxyl group and the nonbridging oxygen of the templating phosphate backbone (Fig. 4, inset). Based on these results, we suspected the formyl and hydroxymethyl modifications containing only one oxygen could be positioned in either of two conformations or somewhere in between. To provide insight into the positioning of the oxygen atom on 5hmC and 5fC in the active site of pol β, we solved a ternary complex structure of 5hmC with the nonhydrolyzable dGTP. Like the structure of 5caC, Watson–Crick base pairing was observed between the base of the incoming dGTP analog and 5hmC, and clear density for the 5hmC modification was present. The 5hmC modification is positioned to form a stabilizing hydrogen bond with N4 of cytosine and avoid a steric clash with the templating phosphate backbone (Fig. 5). The epigenetic modification of cytosine is found throughout vertebrates and is used to regulate transcription. An estimated 70–80% of CpG sites are methylated in human somatic cells, making it likely that DNA repair pathways would encounter such modifications. Here we show that 5mC and its three oxidized forms in the templating base position do not alter the single-turnover rate constant, kpol, or the fidelity of DNA synthesis. However, the efficiency of insertion was decreased ∼20-fold with templating 5caC compared with the other base modifications. Structural analysis revealed backbone repositioning of the DNA template caused by a steric clash between the carboxyl group and the nonbridging phosphate oxygen of the template, and this correlates with the reduced catalytic efficiency observed with the 5caC template base. Lysine 280 stabilizes the altered backbone conformation by directly interacting with the carboxyl modification and the backbone phosphate nonbridging oxygens. Contrary to previous reports of 5fC and 5caC being pro-mutagenic, we observe no evidence for their mutagenicity. Using catalytic efficiencies, we can measure mutation frequencies of ∼0.0001% (for every million insertions one mistake). A 1% mutation frequency would correspond to a catalytic efficiency of ∼0.01 μm−1 s−1. Interestingly, we do observe a ∼1% mutation frequency (kcat/Km = ∼0.01 μm−1 s−1) for the insertion of dATP, but this is observed for all C templates, indicating that the modifications do not enhance dATP insertion. This is consistent with previous studies that revealed that the formyl and carboxyl modifications do not promote the tautomeric form of cytosine (25Szulik M.W. Pallan P.S. Nocek B. Voehler M. Banerjee S. Brooks S. Joachimiak A. Egli M. Eichman B.F. Stone M.P.

Biol. 2016; 11 (26641274): 470-47710.1021/acschembio.5b00762Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is tempting to extrapolate these findings to other eukaryotic polymerases; however, because the fidelity of dATP insertion opposite templating cytosine is low with pol β, it may not be the best exemplar. Polymerases that have high fidelity for the insertion of dATP opposite templating C may show differential effects with these modified templating cytosines. Accordingly, further studies with other eukaryotic polymerases would need to be performed before such broad conclusions are made. The methyl, hydroxymethyl, and formyl modifications of cytosine are accommodated within the active site of pol β without the need for side chain or DNA repositioning, consistent with the results of single-turnover kinetics displaying no effect with these modifications. However, the accommodation of the carboxyl modification in the active site requires template repositioning to avoid a steric/repulsive clash. This required repositioning likely leads to a reduction of productive ternary complexes resulting in a decrease in catalytic efficiency for dGTP insertion. Because the methyl, hydroxymethyl, and formyl modifications are positioned toward the N4 exocyclic amine of cytosine, a steric/repulsive clash with the backbone is avoided. However, the carboxyl modification has two oxygens, so if an intramolecular hydrogen bond is maintained with N4 and one oxygen, a steric/repulsive clash will occur with the other carbonyl oxygen and the phosphate backbone. This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 4. It is worthwhile to consider the alternative conformations that the carboxyl modification or cytosine base may occupy. For instance, the carboxyl modification could rotate relative to the cytosine base (not planar with the cytosine base), breaking the intramolecular H-bond with N4 but avoiding a steric clash with the phosphate backbone. However, it must be energetically more favorable to maintain the intramolecular hydrogen bound and shift the template backbone. Another potential position that could occur to avoid the steric clash is rotation of the N-glycosidic bond, positioning the cytosine base from the canonical anti-conformation and into the syn-conformation. Presumably, this would happen in the binary state before binding nucleotide, because this is what is observed in the templating 8-oxoguanine binary structure (31Batra V.K. Shock D.D. Beard W.A. McKenna C.E. Wilson S.H. Binary complex crystal structure of DNA polymerase β reveals multiple conformations of the templating 8-oxoguanine lesion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, in the 5caC binary structure, the carboxyl modification is positioned far enough away from the backbone phosphate to avoid the clash. Only upon base pairing with the incoming dGTP does the templating 5caC shift into the steric clash position. In previous structures, Lys-280 can be observed in different positions depending on the templating base. However, the methylene portion of the side chain is generally positioned to make van der Waals interactions with the templating base, and the ϵ amino group typically interacts with a nonbridging oxygen of the templating phosphate backbone (31Batra V.K.

The 5caC structure reported here is the first observation of Lys-280 making a specific interaction with a templating base. This highlights the versatility of the polymerase active site. The repositioned conformation observed in the ternary 5caC structure reveals the dynamic nature of the steric block that is created by a kink in the templating DNA strand when bound to the polymerase. This steric block lies on the major groove side of the templating base and discriminates against modifications by shaping the allowable space (Fig. 6). Previous studies revealed that this steric block can be repositioned (“opened”) when 8-oxoguanine is in the templating position, allowing the base to sample both anti- and syn-conformations in the binary complex. As observed here in the 5caC ternary complex structure, opening of the steric block mitigates a potential steric clash with the phosphate backbone of the templating strand. However, in contrast to t"
https://openalex.org/W2921505876,"The number of different fluorescent colors that can be distinguished in a PCR screening assay restricts the number of different targets that can be detected. If only six colors can be distinguished, and the probe for each target is labeled with a unique color, then only six different targets can be identified. Yet, it is often desirable to identify more targets. For instance, the rapid identification of which bacterial species (if any) is present in a patient’s normally sterile blood sample, out of a long list of species, would enable appropriate actions to be taken to prevent sepsis. We realized that the number of different targets that can be identified in a screening assay can be increased significantly by utilizing a unique combination of two colors for the identification of each target species. We prepared a demonstration assay in which 15 different molecular beacon probe pairs were present, each pair specific for the same identifying sequence in the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of a different bacterial species, and each pair labeled with a unique combination of two fluorophores out of the six differently colored fluorophores that our PCR instrument could distinguish. In a set of PCR assays, each containing all 30 color-coded molecular beacons, and each containing DNA from a different bacterial species, the only two colors that arose in each real-time assay identified the species-specific target sequence that was present. Due to the intrinsic low background of molecular beacon probes, these reactions were specific and extremely sensitive, and the threshold cycle reflected the abundance of the target sequence present in each sample."
https://openalex.org/W2895488762,"Chronic PKA phosphorylation of ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) has been shown to increase diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leakage and lead to cardiac dysfunction. We hypothesize that intracellular gene delivery of an RyR2-targeting phosphorylation site—specific nanobody could preserve the contractility of the failing myocardium. In the present study, we acquired RyR2-specific nanobodies from a phage display library that were variable domains of Camelidae heavy chain—only antibodies. One of the nanobodies, AR185, inhibited RyR2 phosphorylation in vitro and was chosen for further investigation. We investigated the potential of adeno-associated virus (AAV)9—mediated cardiac expression of AR185 to combat postischemic heart failure (HF). AAV gene delivery elevated the intracellular expression of the AR185 protein in a rat model of ischemic HF, and this treatment normalized the systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the failing myocardium in vivo by reversing myocardial Ca2+ handling. Furthermore, AR185 gene transfer to failing cardiomyocytes reduced the frequency of SR calcium leaks, thereby restoring the attenuated intracellular calcium transients and SR calcium load. Moreover, AR185 gene transfer inhibited the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of RyR2 in failing cardiomyocytes. Our results provide preclinical experimental evidence that the cardiac expression of RyR2 nanobodies with AAV9 vectors is a promising therapeutic strategy for HF.—Li, T., Shen, Y., Lin, F., Fu, W., Liu, S., Wang, C, Liang, J., Fan, X., Ye, X., Tang, Y., Ding, M., Yang, Y., Lei, C., Hu, S.

https://openalex.org/W2921645214,"Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) subfamily. In this study, we aimed to assess the expression profile of GDF11, its prognostic value in terms of OS, as well as the potential mechanisms leading to its dysregulation in uveal melanoma. A retrospective study was conducted using our primary data and genetic, clinicopathological and overall survival (OS) data from the Cancer Genome Atlas-Uveal Melanoma (TCGA-UVM). Results showed that GDF11 expression was significantly higher in tumor tissues compared with that in adjacent normal tissues. High GDF11 expression was associated with uveal melanoma in advanced stages (IV), epithelioid cell dominant subtype, as well as extrascleral extension. Univariate analysis showed that older age, epithelioid cell dominant, with extrascleral extension and increased GDF11 expression were associated with unfavorable OS. Multivariate analysis confirmed that GDF11 expression was an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS (HR: 1.704, 95%CI: 1.143–2.540, p = 0.009), after adjustment of age, histological subtypes and extrascleral extension. Among the 80 cases of uveal melanoma, only 3 cases had low-level copy gain (+1) and 2 cases had heterozygous loss (-1). No somatic mutations, including SNPs and small INDELs were observed in GDF11 DNA. The methylation of these four CpG sites had weakly (cg22950598 and cg23689080), moderately (cg09890930), or strongly (cg05511733) negative correlation with GDF11 expression. In addition, the patients with high methylation of these four sites had significantly better OS compared to the group with low methylation. Based on these findings, we infer that methylation modulated GDF11 expression might be a valuable prognostic biomarker regarding OS in uveal melanoma."

https://openalex.org/W2920868413,"dsDNA breaks (DSBs) are resected in a 5′→3′ direction, generating single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This promotes DNA repair by homologous recombination and also assembly of signaling complexes that activate the DNA damage checkpoint effector kinase Chk1. In fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), genetic screens have previously uncovered a family of three xeroderma pigmentosum G (XPG)–related nucleases (XRNs), known as Ast1, Exo1, and Rad2. Collectively, these XRNs are recruited to a euchromatic DSB and are required for ssDNA production and end resection across the genome. Here, we studied why there are three related but distinct XRN enzymes that are all conserved across a range of species, including humans, whereas all other DSB response proteins are present as single species. Using S. pombe as a model, ChIP and DSB resection analysis assays, and highly efficient I–PpoI-induced DSBs in the 28S rDNA gene, we observed a hierarchy of recruitment for each XRN, with a progressive compensatory recruitment of the other XRNs as the responding enzymes are deleted. Importantly, we found that this hierarchy reflects the requirement for different XRNs to effect efficient DSB resection in the rDNA, demonstrating that the presence of three XRN enzymes is not a simple division of labor. Furthermore, we uncovered a specificity of XRN function with regard to the direction of transcription. We conclude that the DSB-resection machinery is complex, is nonuniform across the genome, and has built-in fail-safe mechanisms, features that are in keeping with the highly pathological nature of DSB lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2922337469,"Oat (Avena nuda L.) is a nutritious grain crop, rich in dietary fibers and phytochemicals. Application of efficient nitrogen (N) sources and dose is very important to obtain higher crop productivity and to achieve environmental sustainability. The exploitation of natural beneficial microbes and organic nitrogen in combination with chemical nitrogen would be effective to boost soil N for plant uptake. Hence, a field experiment was conducted during 2016 and 2017 with the aim to ameliorate the use of chemical N (CN) with organic nitrogen (ON) and microbial fertilizer (MBF) without compromising the productivity of oat. T1 = control, T2 = 100% CN, T3 = 100% CN+MBF, T4 = 75% CN+ 25% ON+MBF, T5 = 50% CN+ 50% ON+MBF, T6 = 100% ON+MBF, T7 = 100% ON were the treatments. 50% CN + 50% ON + MBF treatment proved to be an efficient combination regarding enhanced biomass and grain yield, nitrogen uptake and NUE as compared to rest of the treatments in both years. During the critical stages of the crop, when most of the applied CN was leached from the top 20 cm soil depth, a substantial N came from the PM mineralization through enhanced microbial activity by the addition of MBF. Lastly, the application of ON supplemented with MBF improved the rhizosphere soil properties, i.e. mineral N concentration, total N (TN), soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), soil respiration rate and enzymatic activity. A balanced and source conscious application of CN, ON and MBF reduced N losses and added a substantial amount of N into the soil N pool. We concluded that organic N combined with chemical N and MBF proved to be effective in improving soil properties ensuring less N loss and increasing oat production in the semi-arid region."
https://openalex.org/W2921575404,"Introduction In outcome research, incomplete follow-up is a major, yet potentially correctable source of bias. Cross-sectional surveys may theoretically increase completeness of follow-up, but low response rates are reported typically. We investigated whether a pre-notification letter improved patient availability for follow-up phone interviews and thereby improved cross-sectional survey yield. Methods A consecutive series of vascular patients was randomly divided into a trial and a validation population. The trial population was then randomized 1:1 to one of two cross-sectional contact strategies: Strategy 1 consisted of direct contact attempts by up to 12 systematically timed phone calls, whereas Strategy 2 used a personalized pre-notification letter to arrange for scheduled phone call interviews. Response rates, average time and efforts needed per patient and overall survey duration were compared. Subsequently, trial findings were externally validated in the validation population. Results Of 728 consecutive patients, 370 were allocated to the trial population. Trial patients contacted by strategy 1 (n = 183) had a similar profile when compared to trial patients contacted by strategy 2 (n = 187). Follow-up periods following surgery (54.3 versus 53.6 months) and all-cause mortality rates (21.3% versus 18.7%) were comparable between the trial groups. Cross-sectional information on survival outcomes was almost complete after both contact strategies (99.5% versus 98.9%, P = 1.0). In 144/187 strategy 2 patients (77%) interviews were scheduled successfully necessitating significantly less contact attempts (median of 1.3 versus 2.3 per patient, P<0.0001). However, invested time per patient was similar between the groups (median of 10.1 versus 9.6 minutes), and survey strategy 1 completed earlier (median time to contact 4 versus 11 days, P<0.0001). Therefore, strategy 1 was validated in the validation population (n = 358): a low lost to follow-up rate below 1% (P = 1.0) was reconfirmed necessitating an average of 2.3 contact attempts per patient. Conclusions Both contact strategies were equally successful in contacting almost all patients cross-sectionally. If systematically timed, direct phone calls were less complicated to organize and faster completed. Given the low time and effort per patient, outcome studies should invest in systematic follow-up surveys to minimize attrition bias."
https://openalex.org/W2922487294,"We investigate how the rewards of individual tasks dictate a priori how easy it is to interleave two discrete tasks efficiently, and whether people then interleave efficiently. Previous research found that people vary in their ability to interleave efficiently. Less attention has been given to whether it was realistic to expect efficient interleaving, given the reward rate of each of the involved tasks. Using a simulation model, we demonstrate how the rewards of individual tasks lead to different dual-task interleaving scenarios. We identify three unique dual-task scenarios. In easy scenarios, many strategies for time division between tasks can achieve optimal performance. This gives great opportunity to optimize performance, but also leads to variation in the applied strategies due to a lack of pressure to settle on a small set of optimal strategies. In difficult scenarios, the optimal strategy is hard to identify, therefore giving little opportunity to optimize. Finally, constrained scenarios have a well-defined prediction of the optimal strategy. It gives a narrow prediction, which limits the options to achieve optimal scores, yet given the structure people are able to optimize their strategies. These scenarios are therefore best to test people's general capability of optimizing interleaving. We report three empirical studies that test these hypotheses. In each study, participants interleave between two identical discrete tasks, that differ only in the underlying reward functions and the combined result (easy, difficult, or constrained scenario). Empirical results match the theoretical pattern as predicted by simulation models. Implications for theory and practice are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2921079835,"There are limited data on protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) amongst children in resource-limited settings, for informing on optimal paediatric regimens.To evaluate therapeutic response to PI-based ART amongst HIV-infected Cameroonian children.A retrospective study was conducted amongst children aged 2-18 years receiving a PI-based ART at the Essos Hospital Centre (EHC), Yaounde, Cameroon. Primary end points were therapeutic success on PI-based ART, defined as clinical success (WHO I/II clinical stage), immunological success (CD4 ≥ 500/mm3) and viral suppression (viral load [VL]<1000 copies/ml). Factors associated with therapeutic success were assessed in uni- and multivariate analysis using SPSS software v.2.0; with p<0.05 considered statistically significant.A total of 71 eligible children on PI-based ART were enrolled (42 on initial and 29 on substituted regimens), with a median age of 8 [IQR: 5-12] years and mean duration on ART of 7 years. Following therapeutic responses, all (100%) experienced clinical success, 95.2% experienced immunological success (91.7% on initial and 97.2% on substituted PI/r-based regimens) and 74.7% viral suppression. In univariate analysis, viral suppression was associated with: younger age (p<0.0001), living with parents as opposed to guardians (p = 0.049), and the educational level (p<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, only the age ranges of 10-14 years (OR: 0.22 [0.07-0.73]) and 15-18 years (OR: 0.08 [0.02-0.57]), were determinants of poor viral suppression.Among these Cameroonian children, PI-based ART confers favourable clinical and immunological outcomes. The poor rate of viral suppression was mainly attributed to adolescence (10-18 years)."
