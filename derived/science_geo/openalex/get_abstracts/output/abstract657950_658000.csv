https://openalex.org/W3049142173,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virions are surrounded by a lipid bilayer from which spike (S) protein trimers protrude1. Heavily glycosylated S trimers bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and mediate entry of virions into target cells2–6. S exhibits extensive conformational flexibility: it modulates exposure of its receptor-binding site and subsequently undergoes complete structural rearrangement to drive fusion of viral and cellular membranes2,7,8. The structures and conformations of soluble, overexpressed, purified S proteins have been studied in detail using cryo-electron microscopy2,7,9–12, but the structure and distribution of S on the virion surface remain unknown. Here we applied cryo-electron microscopy and tomography to image intact SARS-CoV-2 virions and determine the high-resolution structure, conformational flexibility and distribution of S trimers in situ on the virion surface. These results reveal the conformations of S on the virion, and provide a basis from which to understand interactions between S and neutralizing antibodies during infection or vaccination. Cryo-electron microscopy and tomography studies reveal the structures, conformations and distributions of spike protein trimers on intact severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virions and provide a basis for understanding the interactions of the spike protein with neutralizing antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W3049325061,"Improved understanding and management of COVID-19, a potentially life-threatening disease, could greatly reduce the threat posed by its etiologic agent, SARS-CoV-2. Toward this end, we have identified a core peripheral blood immune signature across 63 hospital-treated patients with COVID-19 who were otherwise highly heterogeneous. The signature includes discrete changes in B and myelomonocytic cell composition, profoundly altered T cell phenotypes, selective cytokine/chemokine upregulation and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Some signature traits identify links with other settings of immunoprotection and immunopathology; others, including basophil and plasmacytoid dendritic cell depletion, correlate strongly with disease severity; while a third set of traits, including a triad of IP-10, interleukin-10 and interleukin-6, anticipate subsequent clinical progression. Hence, contingent upon independent validation in other COVID-19 cohorts, individual traits within this signature may collectively and individually guide treatment options; offer insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis; and aid early, risk-based patient stratification that is particularly beneficial in phasic diseases such as COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3049406491,"Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) amplification promotes intratumoral genetic heterogeneity and accelerated tumor evolution1-3; however, its frequency and clinical impact are unclear. Using computational analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from 3,212 cancer patients, we show that ecDNA amplification frequently occurs in most cancer types but not in blood or normal tissue. Oncogenes were highly enriched on amplified ecDNA, and the most common recurrent oncogene amplifications arose on ecDNA. EcDNA amplifications resulted in higher levels of oncogene transcription compared to copy number-matched linear DNA, coupled with enhanced chromatin accessibility, and more frequently resulted in transcript fusions. Patients whose cancers carried ecDNA had significantly shorter survival, even when controlled for tissue type, than patients whose cancers were not driven by ecDNA-based oncogene amplification. The results presented here demonstrate that ecDNA-based oncogene amplification is common in cancer, is different from chromosomal amplification and drives poor outcome for patients across many cancer types."
https://openalex.org/W3049124952,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease resulting in irreversible, progressive destruction of articular cartilage1. The etiology of OA is complex and involves a variety of factors, including genetic predisposition, acute injury and chronic inflammation2–4. Here we investigate the ability of resident skeletal stem-cell (SSC) populations to regenerate cartilage in relation to age, a possible contributor to the development of osteoarthritis5–7. We demonstrate that aging is associated with progressive loss of SSCs and diminished chondrogenesis in the joints of both mice and humans. However, a local expansion of SSCs could still be triggered in the chondral surface of adult limb joints in mice by stimulating a regenerative response using microfracture (MF) surgery. Although MF-activated SSCs tended to form fibrous tissues, localized co-delivery of BMP2 and soluble VEGFR1 (sVEGFR1), a VEGF receptor antagonist, in a hydrogel skewed differentiation of MF-activated SSCs toward articular cartilage. These data indicate that following MF, a resident stem-cell population can be induced to generate cartilage for treatment of localized chondral disease in OA. Endogenous skeletal stem cells are recruited to form cartilage in mice when stimulated by microfracture surgery together with localized delivery of growth factors, pointing to a new approach for treating cartilage defects."
https://openalex.org/W3048973619,"Currently approved immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies targeting the PD-1 and CTLA-4 receptor pathways are powerful treatment options for certain cancers; however, most patients across cancer types still fail to respond. Consequently, there is interest in discovering and blocking alternative pathways that mediate immune suppression. One such mechanism is an upregulation of sialoglycans in malignancy, which has been recently shown to inhibit immune cell activation through multiple mechanisms and therefore represents a targetable glycoimmune checkpoint. Since these glycans are not canonically druggable, we designed an αHER2 antibody-sialidase conjugate that potently and selectively strips diverse sialoglycans from breast cancer cells. In syngeneic breast cancer models, desialylation enhanced immune cell infiltration and activation and prolonged the survival of mice, an effect that was dependent on expression of the Siglec-E checkpoint receptor found on tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. Thus, antibody-sialidase conjugates represent a promising modality for glycoimmune checkpoint therapy."

We investigated how device-based physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and different intensity profiles were associated with all-cause mortality. We used a network harmonization approach to map dominant-wrist acceleration to PAEE in 96,476 UK Biobank participants (mean age 62 years, 56% female). We also calculated the fraction of PAEE accumulated from moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA). Over the median 3.1-year follow-up period (302,526 person-years), 732 deaths were recorded. Higher PAEE was associated with a lower hazard of all-cause mortality for a constant fraction of MVPA (for example, 21% (95% confidence interval 4-35%) lower hazard for 20 versus 15 kJ kg-1 d-1 PAEE with 10% from MVPA). Similarly, a higher MVPA fraction was associated with a lower hazard when PAEE remained constant (for example, 30% (8-47%) lower hazard when 20% versus 10% of a fixed 15 kJ kg-1 d-1 PAEE volume was from MVPA). Our results show that higher volumes of PAEE are associated with reduced mortality rates, and achieving the same volume through higher-intensity activity is associated with greater reductions than through lower-intensity activity. The linkage of device-measured activity to energy expenditure creates a framework for using wearables for personalized prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3048977247,"Recent success in identifying gene-regulatory elements in the context of recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors has enabled cell-type-restricted gene expression. However, within the cerebral cortex these tools are largely limited to broad classes of neurons. To overcome this limitation, we developed a strategy that led to the identification of multiple new enhancers to target functionally distinct neuronal subtypes. By investigating the regulatory landscape of the disease gene Scn1a, we discovered enhancers selective for parvalbumin (PV) and vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing interneurons. Demonstrating the functional utility of these elements, we show that the PV-specific enhancer allowed for the selective targeting and manipulation of these neurons across vertebrate species, including humans. Finally, we demonstrate that our selection method is generalizable and characterizes additional PV-specific enhancers with exquisite specificity within distinct brain regions. Altogether, these viral tools can be used for cell-type-specific circuit manipulation and hold considerable promise for use in therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3049305262,"Multifunctional living materials are attractive due to their powerful ability to self-repair and replicate. However, most natural materials lack electronic functionality. Here we show that an electric field, applied to electricity-producing Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms, stimulates production of cytochrome OmcZ nanowires with 1,000-fold higher conductivity (30 S cm−1) and threefold higher stiffness (1.5 GPa) than the cytochrome OmcS nanowires that are important in natural environments. Using chemical imaging-based multimodal nanospectroscopy, we correlate protein structure with function and observe pH-induced conformational switching to β-sheets in individual nanowires, which increases their stiffness and conductivity by 100-fold due to enhanced π-stacking of heme groups; this was further confirmed by computational modeling and bulk spectroscopic studies. These nanowires can transduce mechanical and chemical stimuli into electrical signals to perform sensing, synthesis and energy production. These findings of biologically produced, highly conductive protein nanowires may help to guide the development of seamless, bidirectional interfaces between biological and electronic systems. Application of an electrical field to Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms stimulates production of OmcZ nanowires, which undergo a pH-induced conformational switch that causes increased stiffness and conductivity due to enhanced heme group π-stacking."
https://openalex.org/W3049263567,"Axon degeneration is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders. The current assumption is that the decision of injured axons to degenerate is cell-autonomously regulated. Here we show that Schwann cells (SCs), the glia of the peripheral nervous system, protect injured axons by virtue of a dramatic glycolytic upregulation that arises in SCs as an inherent adaptation to axon injury. This glycolytic response, paired with enhanced axon-glia metabolic coupling, supports the survival of axons. The glycolytic shift in SCs is largely driven by the metabolic signaling hub, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, and the downstream transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha and c-Myc, which together promote glycolytic gene expression. The manipulation of glial glycolytic activity through this pathway enabled us to accelerate or delay the degeneration of perturbed axons in acute and subacute rodent axon degeneration models. Thus, we demonstrate a non-cell-autonomous metabolic mechanism that controls the fate of injured axons."

https://openalex.org/W3049090688,"The identification of prostate stem/progenitor cells and characterization of the prostate epithelial cell lineage hierarchy are critical for understanding prostate cancer initiation. Here, we characterized 35,129 cells from mouse prostates, and identified a unique luminal cell type (termed type C luminal cell (Luminal-C)) marked by Tacstd2, Ck4 and Psca expression. Luminal-C cells located at the distal prostate invagination tips (termed Dist-Luminal-C) exhibited greater capacity for organoid formation in vitro and prostate epithelial duct regeneration in vivo. Lineage tracing of Luminal-C cells indicated that Dist-Luminal-C cells reconstituted distal prostate luminal lineages through self-renewal and differentiation. Deletion of Pten in Dist-Luminal-C cells resulted in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. We further characterized 11,374 human prostate cells and confirmed the existence of h-Luminal-C cells. Our study provides insights into the prostate lineage hierarchy, identifies Dist-Luminal-C cells as the luminal progenitor cell population in invagination tips and suggests one of the potential cellular origins of prostate cancer."

https://openalex.org/W3049292195,"Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis may involve the epigenetic control of enhancers that modify neuronal functions. Here, we comprehensively examine DNA methylation at enhancers, genome-wide, in neurons of patients with PD and of control individuals. We find a widespread increase in cytosine modifications at enhancers in PD neurons, which is partly explained by elevated hydroxymethylation levels. In particular, patients with PD exhibit an epigenetic and transcriptional upregulation of TET2, a master-regulator of cytosine modification status. TET2 depletion in a neuronal cell model results in cytosine modification changes that are reciprocal to those observed in PD neurons. Moreover, Tet2 inactivation in mice fully prevents nigral dopaminergic neuronal loss induced by previous inflammation. Tet2 loss also attenuates transcriptional immune responses to an inflammatory trigger. Thus, widespread epigenetic dysregulation of enhancers in PD neurons may, in part, be mediated by increased TET2 expression. Decreased Tet2 activity is neuroprotective, in vivo, and may be a new therapeutic target for PD."
https://openalex.org/W3049184299,"T-cell recognition of peptides incorporating nonsynonymous mutations, or neoepitopes, is a cornerstone of tumor immunity and forms the basis of new immunotherapy approaches including personalized cancer vaccines. Yet as they are derived from self-peptides, the means through which immunogenic neoepitopes overcome immune self-tolerance are often unclear. Here we show that a point mutation in a non-major histocompatibility complex anchor position induces structural and dynamic changes in an immunologically active ovarian cancer neoepitope. The changes pre-organize the peptide into a conformation optimal for recognition by a neoepitope-specific T-cell receptor, allowing the receptor to bind the neoepitope with high affinity and deliver potent T-cell signals. Our results emphasize the importance of structural and physical changes relative to self in neoepitope immunogenicity. Considered broadly, these findings can help explain some of the difficulties in identifying immunogenic neoepitopes from sequence alone and provide guidance for developing novel, neoepitope-based personalized therapies. Structural and biophysical approaches suggest that structural preorganization is important for triggering endogenous CD8+ T cells and escape from immune tolerance, as demonstrated by a single nonsynonymous mutation in an ovarian cancer neoepitope"
https://openalex.org/W3068601707,"Movement behaviours (e.g., sleep, sedentary behaviour, and physical activity) in isolation have demonstrated benefits to preschool-aged children's development. However, little is known on the integrated nature of movement behaviours and their relationship to healthy development in this age range. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the relationships between accelerometer-derived movement behaviours and indicators of physical, cognitive, and social-emotional development using compositional analyses in a sample of preschool-aged children.Children (n = 95) were recruited in Edmonton, Canada. Movement behaviours were measured with ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers worn 24 hours/day. Physical (i.e., body mass index [BMI] z-scores, percent of adult height, and motor skills), cognitive (i.e., working memory, response inhibition, and vocabulary), and social-emotional (i.e., sociability, externalizing, internalizing, prosocial behaviour, and cognitive, emotional, and behavioural self-regulation) development were assessed. Objective height and weight were measured for BMI z-scores and percent of adult height, while the Test of Gross Motor Development-2 was used to assess motor skills. The Early Years Toolbox was used to assess all cognitive and social-emotional development indicators. Compositional linear regression models and compositional substitution models were conducted in R.Children accumulated 11.1 hours of sleep, 6.1 hours of stationary time, 5.1 hours of light-intensity physical activity (LPA), and 1.8 hours of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) per day. Movement behaviour compositions were significantly associated with physical (i.e., locomotor skills, object motor skills, and total motor skills) and cognitive (i.e., working memory and vocabulary) development (R2 range: 0.11-0.18). In relation to other movement behaviours in the composition, MVPA was positively associated with most physical development outcomes; while stationary time had mixed findings for cognitive development outcomes (i.e., mainly positive associations in linear regressions but non-significant in substitution models). Most associations for LPA and sleep were non-significant.The overall composition of movement behaviors appeared important for development. Findings confirmed the importance of MVPA for physical development. Mixed findings between stationary time and cognitive development could indicate this sample engaged in both beneficial (e.g., reading) and detrimental (e.g., screen time) stationary time. However, further research is needed to determine the mechanisms for these relationships."

https://openalex.org/W3067418322,"Cerebral ischemia causes damage to the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and alleviating BBB destruction will be of great significance for the treatment and prognosis of ischemic stroke. Recently, microRNAs have been shown to play a critical role in BBB integrity. However, the potential mechanism by which microRNA-182 (miR-182) affects the BBB in ischemic stroke remains unclear. We demonstrated for the first time that cerebral ischemia leads to a significant progressive increase in miR-182 after pMCAO, and bEnd.3 cells are the primary target cells of miR-182. In miR-182 KD transgenic mice, infarct volume, and BBB permeability were attenuated, and tight junction (TJ) proteins increased. Inhibition of miR-182 with an antagomir reduced OGD-induced apoptosis of bEnd.3 cells and the loss of ZO-1 and Occludin. To further explore the mechanism by which miR-182 regulates BBB integrity, we detected the apoptotic proteins Bcl-2/Bax and demonstrated that mTOR and FOXO1 were the targets of miR-182. Inhibition of mTOR/FOXO1 by rapamycin/AS1842856 decreased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and exacerbated TJ protein loss. Taken together, inhibition of miR-182 protects BBB integrity by reducing endothelial cell apoptosis through the mTOR/FOXO1 pathway. Thus, miR-182 may be a potential target for the treatment of BBB disruption during cerebral ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W3052308028,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common comorbidity in males with diabetes mellitus (DM), whose pathogenesis might be induced by dysregulation of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells (CCSMCs). Gene Expression Omnibus repository-based analysis identified the differentially expressed PDCD4 in DM rats. PDCD4 has also been determined as a putative gene under the regulatory control of microRNA-21-5p (miR-21-5p). This study aimed to further determine the functional role of miR-21-5p in CCSMCs in a rat model of diabetes mellitus-induced erectile dysfunction (DMED). CCSMCs were isolated from penile cavernous tissue and cultured in high glucose (HG) medium. The expression of miR-21-5p and/or PDCD4 was altered in CCSMCs, as directly or indirectly measured by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and TUNEL assays. Furthermore, exosomes were isolated from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transfected with miR-21-5p mimic or miR-21-5p inhibitor and co-cultured with CCSMCs. DMED rats were injected with lentivirus carrying PDCD4/siRNA-PDCD4 plasmids, or exosomes from MSCs containing miR-21-5p-agomir to explore their roles in vivo. The experimental data validated that PDCD4 was upregulated in cavernous tissue of DMED rats. miR-21-5p targeted and inhibited PDCD4. miR-21-5p was enriched in MSC-exosomes. Moreover, PDCD4 downregulation, miR-21-5p elevation or MSC-derived exosomal miR-21-5p reduced apoptosis and enhanced proliferation of CCSMCs cultured in HG medium. PDCD4 silencing or miR-21-5p-containing MSC-exosomes improved erectile function and smooth muscle density in DMED rats. Collectively, our findings suggested that MSC-derived exosomal miR-21-5p suppressed PDCD4 expression and ED in rats with DM."

Thus, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors related to the completion of four antenatal care visits among mothers who gave birth 6 months preceding the study.We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The quantitative component included administering a pre-tested structured questionnaire to 466 mothers who gave birth 6 months preceding the study using a simple random sampling technique from respective Tabias. The quantitative result was analyzed using SPSS version 22. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was done to determine the association between independent and dependent variables. Variables were declared as statistically significant at P ≤ 0.05 in multivariable logistic regression model. The qualitative interview data were collected from eight mothers and four key informants recruited through purposive sampling method.The overall prevalence of completion of four ANC visits based on the recommended time schedule was 9.9% (95% CI, 7.1-12.4). However, 63.9% of the participants attended four visits or more regardless of the recommended time schedule. Being member of community health insurance (AOR 2.140, 95% CI, 1.032-4.436), walking on foot less than or equal one hour to reach the health facility (AOR 3.921, 95% CI, 1.915-8.031), having workload at home (AOR 0.369, 95% CI, 0.182-0.751), and husband supported during antenatal care (AOR 2.561, 95% CI, 1.252-5.240) were independently associated with the completion of four ANC visits based on the recommended time schedule in multivariable analysis.The completion of four ANC contacts based on the recommended time schedule remains low in rural areas of Northern Ethiopia. Being a member of community health insurance, distance to the health facility, workload, and male involvement were associated with the completion of four ANC visits based on the recommended time schedule. The existing health system should consider improving the recommended ANC visits by integrating Community based interventions."

https://openalex.org/W3060080821,"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite that causes lethal diseases in immunocompromised patients. Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) regulates many cellular processes by degrading ubiquitinylated proteins. The UBL-UBA shuttle protein family, which escorts the ubiquitinylated proteins to the proteasome for degradation, are crucial components of UPS. Here, we identified three UBL-UBA shuttle proteins (TGGT1_304680, DNA damage inducible protein 1, DDI1; TGGT1_295340, UV excision repair protein rad23 protein, RAD23; and TGGT1_223680, ubiquitin family protein, DSK2) localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of T gondii. Deletion of shuttle proteins inhibited parasites growth and resulted in accumulation of ubiquitinylated proteins. Cell division of triple-gene knockout strain was asynchronous. In addition, we found that the retroviral aspartic protease activity of the nonclassical shuttle protein DDI1 was important for the virulence of Toxoplasma in mice. These results showed the critical roles of UBL-UBA shuttle proteins in regulating the degradation of ubiquitinylated proteins and cell division of T gondii."

https://openalex.org/W3049289415,"Activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and ensuing desmoplasia play an important role in the growth and progression of solid tumors. Here we demonstrate that, within colon and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumors, efficient stromagenesis relies on downregulation of the IFNAR1 chain of the type I interferon (IFN1) receptor. Expression of the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and accumulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) was notably impaired in tumors grown in the Ifnar1S526A (SA) knock-in mice, which are deficient in IFNAR1 downregulation. Primary fibroblasts from these mice exhibited elevated levels of Smad7, a negative regulator of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) pathway. Knockdown of Smad7 alleviated deficient ECM production in SA fibroblasts in response to TGFβ. Analysis of human colorectal cancers revealed an inverse correlation between IFNAR1 and FAP levels. Whereas growth of tumors in SA mice was stimulated by co-injection of wild type but not SA fibroblasts, genetic ablation of IFNAR1 in fibroblasts also accelerated tumor growth. We discuss how inactivation of IFNAR1 in CAFs acts to stimulate stromagenesis and tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W3068668650,"In recent years, several studies suggested that the ability of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) to promote healing in patients with diabetic ulcers and chronic wounds is due to the reduction of inflammatory cytokines and to a significant decrease in neutrophils recruitment to the damaged area. α4 and β2 integrins are receptors mediating the neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium and the comprehension of the effects of hyperbaric oxygenation on their expression and functions in neutrophils could be of great importance for the design of novel therapeutic protocols focused on anti-inflammatory agents. In this study, the α4 and β2 integrins’ expression and functions have been evaluated in human primary neutrophils obtained from patients with chronic non-healing wounds and undergoing a prolonged HBOT (150 kPa per 90 minutes). The effect of a peptidomimetic α4β1 integrin antagonist has been also analyzed under these conditions. A statistically significant decrease (68%) in β2 integrin expression on neutrophils was observed during the treatment with HBO and maintained one month after the last treatment, while α4 integrin levels remained unchanged. However, cell adhesion function of both neutrophilic integrins α4β1 and β2 was significantly reduced 70 and 67%, respectively), but α4β1 integrin was still sensitive to antagonist inhibition in the presence of fibronectin, suggesting that a combined therapy between HBOT and integrin antagonists could have greater antinflammatory efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3009083016,"Abrupt dietary changes, as can be common when managing horses, may lead to compositional changes in gut microbiota, which may result in digestive or metabolic disturbances. The aim of this study was to describe and compare the faecal microbiota of ponies abruptly changed from pasture grazing ad libitum to a restricted hay-only diet and vice versa. The experiment consisted of two, 14-day periods. Faecal samples were collected on day 0 and days 1–3,7,14 after abrupt dietary change from grass to hay and from hay to grass. Microbial populations were characterised by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using the Illumina MiSeq platform, 4,777,315 sequences were obtained from 6 ponies. Further analyses were performed to characterise the microbiome as well as the relative abundance of microbiota present. The results of this study suggest that the faecal microbiota of mature ponies is highly diverse, and the relative abundances of individual taxa change in response to abrupt changes in diet. The faecal microbiota of ponies maintained on a restricted amount of hay-only was similar to that of the ponies fed solely grass ad libitum in terms of richness and phylogenetic diversity; however, it differed significantly in terms of the relative abundances at distinct taxonomic levels. Class Bacilli, order Lactobacillales, family Lactobacillaceae, and genus Lactobacillus were presented in increased relative abundance on day 2 after an abrupt dietary change from hay to grass compared to all other experimental days (P <0.05). Abrupt changes from grass to hay and vice versa affect the faecal microbial community structure; moreover, the order of dietary change appears to have a profound effect in the first few days following the transition. An abrupt dietary change from hay to grass may represent a higher risk for gut disturbances compared to abrupt change from grass to hay."
https://openalex.org/W3056839841,"Microfinance is a widely promoted developmental initiative to provide poor women with affordable financial services for poverty alleviation. One popular adaption in South Asia is the Self-Help Group (SHG) model that India adopted in 2011 as part of a federal poverty alleviation program and as a secondary approach of integrating health literacy services for rural women. However, the evidence is limited on who joins and continues in SHG programs. This paper examines the determinants of membership and staying members (outcomes) in an integrated microfinance and health literacy program from one of India's poorest and most populated states, Uttar Pradesh across a range of explanatory variables related to economic, socio-demographic and area-level characteristics.Using secondary survey data from the Uttar Pradesh Community Mobilization project comprising of 15,300 women from SHGs and Non-SHG households in rural India, we performed multivariate logistic and hurdle negative binomial regression analyses to model SHG membership and duration.While in general poor women are more likely to be SHG members based on an income threshold limit (government-sponsored BPL cards), women from poorest households are more likely to become members, but less likely to stay members, when further classified using asset-based wealth quintiles. Additionally, poorer households compared to the marginally poor are less likely to become SHG members when borrowing for any reason, including health reasons. Only women from moderately poor households are more likely to continue as members if borrowing for health and non-income-generating reasons. The study found that an increasing number of previous pregnancies is associated with a higher membership likelihood in contrast to another study from India reporting a negative association.The study supports the view that microfinance programs need to examine their inclusion and retention strategies in favour of poorest household using multidimensional indicators that can capture poverty in its myriad forms."
https://openalex.org/W3075910286,"Endemic and restricted-range species are considered to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental change, which makes assessing likely climate change effects on geographic distributions of such species important to the development of integrated conservation strategies. Here, we determined distributional patterns for an endemic species of Dianthus (Dianthus polylepis) in the Irano-Turanian region using a maximum-entropy algorithm. In total, 70 occurrence points and 19 climatic variables were used to estimate the potential distributional area under current conditions and two future representative concentration pathway (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) scenarios under seven general circulation models for 2050. Mean diurnal range, iso-thermality, minimum temperature of coldest quarter, and annual precipitation were major factors that appeared to structure the distribution of the species. Most current potential suitable areas were located in montane regions. Model transfers to future-climate scenarios displayed upward shifts in elevation and northward shifts geographically for the species. Our results can be used to define high-priority areas in the Irano-Turanian region for conservation management plans for this species and can offer a template for analyses of other endangered and threatened species in the region."

This retrospective database study analyzed the Medical Data Vision database for DLBCL patients who received treatment during the identification period from October 1 2008 to December 31 2017. Among 6,965 eligible DLBCL patients, 5,541 patients (79.6%) received first-line (1L) rituximab (R)-based therapy, and then were gradually switched to chemotherapy without R in subsequent lines of therapy. In each treatment regimen, 1L treatment cost was the highest among all lines of therapy. The major cost drivers i.e. total direct medical costs until death or censoring across all regimens and lines of therapy were from the 1L regimen and inpatient costs. During the follow-up period, DLBCL patients who received a 1L R-CHOP regimen achieved the highest survival rate and longest time-to-next-treatment, with a relatively low mean treatment cost due to lower inpatient healthcare resource utilization and fewer lines of therapy compared to other 1L regimens. Our retrospective analysis of clinical practices in Japanese DLBCL patients demonstrated that 1L treatment and inpatient costs were major cost contributors and that the use of 1L R-CHOP was associated with better clinical outcomes at a relatively low mean treatment cost."

But, function of OGG1 in pulmonary fibrosis was not entirely clear. In this study, we identified a novel function of OGG1 in the cell transformation process in pulmonary fibrosis. We demonstrated that OGG1 and Smad7 co-localize and interact in A549 cells. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis was established in wild-type (WT) and Ogg1-/- mice. Upon treatment with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, increased OGG1 expression was observed in WT mice with pulmonary fibrosis as well as in A549 cells, MRC-5 cells, and primary rat type II alveolar epithelial cells. The increased expression of OGG1 promoted cell migration, while OGG1 depletion decreased migration ability. Expression of the transformation-associated markers vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin were also affected by OGG1. We also observed that OGG1 promoted TGF-β1-induced cell transformation and activated Smad2/3 by interacting with Smad7. The interaction between OGG1 and the TGF-β/Smad axis modulates the cell transformation process in lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Moreover, we demonstrated that Ogg1 deficiency relieved pulmonary fibrosis in bleomycin-treated mice. Ogg1 knockout decreased the bleomycin-induced expression of Smad7 and phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in mice.

To test TI in non-human animals, transitive responding has been examined in a TI task where non-adjacent pairs were presented after premise pair training. Some mammals, birds and paper wasps can pass TI tasks. Although previous studies showed that some fish are capable of TI in the social context, it remains unclear whether fish can pass TI task. Here, we conducted a TI task in cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus), which interact with various client fishes and conspecifics. Because they make decisions based on previous direct and indirect interactions in the context of cleaning interactions, we predicted that the ability of TI is beneficial for cleaner fish. Four tested fish were trained with four pairs of visual stimuli in a 5-term series: A-B+, B-C+, C-D+, and D-E+ (plus and minus denote rewards and non-rewards, respectively). After training, a novel pair, BD (BD test), was presented wherein the fish chose D more frequently than B. In contrast, reinforcement history did not predict the choice D. Our results suggest that cleaner fish passed the TI task, similar to mammals and birds. Although the mechanism underlying transitive responding in cleaner fish remains unclear, this work contributes to understanding cognitive abilities in fish."
https://openalex.org/W3071592245,"In human lung cancer progression, the EMT process is characterized by the transformation of cancer cells into invasive forms that migrate to other organs. Targeting to EMT-related molecules is emerging as a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention of lung cancer cell migration and invasion. Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) has recently been considered as an anti-proliferative target molecule to regulate the Wnt signaling pathway in several types of cancer cells. In the present study, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib and the integrin-αⅤβ3 targeted cyclic peptide (cRGDfK) on EMT in human lung cancer cells. Sunitinib strongly inhibited the TGF-β1-activated EMT through suppression of Wnt signaling, Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways. In addition, the cRGDfK also inhibited the expression of TGFβ1-induced mesenchymal marker genes and proteins. The anti-EMT effect of sunitinib was enhanced when cRGDfK was treated together. When sunitinib was treated with cRGDfK, the mRNA and protein expression levels of mesenchymal markers were decreased compared to the treatment with sunitinib alone. Co-treatment of cRGDfK has shown the potential to improve the efficacy of anticancer agents in combination with therapeutic agents that may be toxic at high concentrations. These results provide new and improved therapies for treating and preventing EMT-related disorders, such as lung fibrosis and cancer metastasis, and relapse."
https://openalex.org/W3061707903,"Pancreatic beta cell death is a hallmark of type 1 and 2 diabetes (T1D/T2D), but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Key proteins of the DNA damage response (DDR), including tumor protein P53 (P53, also known as TP53 or TRP53 in rodents) and Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM), a kinase known to act upstream of P53, have been associated with T2D. Here we test and compare the effect of ATM and P53 ablation on beta cell survival in the rat beta cell line Ins1E. We demonstrate that ATM and P53 differentially regulate beta cell apoptosis induced upon fundamentally different types of diabetogenic beta cell stress, including DNA damage, inflammation, lipotoxicity and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. DNA damage induced apoptosis by treatment with the commonly used diabetogenic agent streptozotocin (STZ) is regulated by both ATM and P53. We show that ATM is a key STZ induced activator of P53 and that amelioration of STZ induced cell death by inhibition of ATM mainly depends on P53. While both P53 and ATM control lipotoxic beta cell apoptosis, ATM but not P53 fails to alter inflammatory beta cell death. In contrast, tunicamycin induced (ER stress associated) apoptosis is further increased by ATM knockdown or inhibition, but not by P53 knockdown. Our results reveal differential roles for P53 and ATM in beta cell survival in vitro in the context of four key pathophysiological types of diabetogenic beta cell stress, and indicate that ATM can use P53 independent signaling pathways to modify beta cell survival, dependent on the cellular insult."
https://openalex.org/W3062079985,"Recent research has shown relationships between health outcomes and residence proximity to unconventional oil and natural gas development (UOGD). The challenge of connecting health outcomes to environmental stressors requires ongoing research with new methodological approaches. We investigated UOGD density and well emissions and their association with symptom reporting by residents of southwest Pennsylvania. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 104 unique, de-identified health assessments completed from 2012–2017 by residents living in proximity to UOGD. A novel approach to comparing estimates of exposure was taken. Generalized linear modeling was used to ascertain the relationship between symptom counts and estimated UOGD exposure, while Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) was used to identify associations between individual symptoms and estimated UOGD exposure. We used three estimates of exposure: cumulative well density (CWD), inverse distance weighting (IDW) of wells, and annual emission concentrations (AEC) from wells within 5 km of respondents’ homes. Taking well emissions reported to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, an air dispersion and screening model was used to estimate an emissions concentration at residences. When controlling for age, sex, and smoker status, each exposure estimate predicted total number of reported symptoms (CWD, p<0.001; IDW, p<0.001; AEC, p<0.05). Akaike information criterion values revealed that CWD was the better predictor of adverse health symptoms in our sample. Two groups of symptoms (i.e., eyes, ears, nose, throat; neurological and muscular) constituted 50% of reported symptoms across exposures, suggesting these groupings of symptoms may be more likely reported by respondents when UOGD intensity increases. Our results do not confirm that UOGD was the direct cause of the reported symptoms but raise concern about the growing number of wells around residential areas. Our approach presents a novel method of quantifying exposures and relating them to reported health symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3056253928,"Human infection of orthohantavirus can cause potentially fatal diseases, such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV) in Eurasia. Exosomes are new carriers for information exchange between cells. Cumulative findings suggest that exosomes released from parental infected cells can block or promote viral infection in recipient cells, but the role of exosomes in hantavirus infection is poorly understood. In our study, we identified the exosomes derived from HTNV-infected human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Exo-HV) and found the antiviral properties of Exo-HV in the uninfected recipient cells. High-throughput sequencing revealed the distinctly expressed miRNAs transcriptomes in Exo-HV. MiR-145-5p, one of the abundant miRNAs packaged into Exo-HV, was found to be able to transferred to recipient cells and functioned by directly targeting M RNA of HTNV 76-118 and inducing type I interferon (IFN-I) response, thus, blocking the viral replication. Concluding, this study indicated that exosomes released by HTNV-infected HUVECs were able to transfer active molecules, miR-145-5p as a proving sample, to mediate novel anti-HTNV activity in the neighboring uninfected cells, which will help us to explore new strategies for the treatment of infectious disease utilizing exosomes with miRNA."
https://openalex.org/W3078561748,"Many studies support that Episodic Future Thinking (EFT) reduces maladaptive health behaviors and how much individuals devalue the future (steepness of delay discounting). In order to understand the clinical utility of EFT, a control procedure that equates groups in non-specific treatment factors (e.g., expectancy of change, perceived connection of content to health behavior) is needed. The present research evaluated the effects of EFT relative to a novel control (health information thinking; HIT), which was designed to be structurally similar to EFT while incorporating elements from existing clinical controls. In a sample of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers (N = 254), we found that EFT reduced discounting relative to the HIT procedure and a standard EFT control. There were some affective differences across groups and differences in adherence to the intervention content, but these were unrelated to discounting. Delay discounting was not equivalent across the control groups, but this may not be a necessary condition to fulfill for a clinical control. Future research will need to identify whether the HIT procedure serves as a good control for other dependent variables when studying EFT and develop controls analogous to usual care or a ""wait-list"" in clinical contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3049469146,"The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is a highly regulated protein disposal process critical to cell survival. Inhibiting the pathway induces proteotoxic stress and can be an effective cancer treatment. The therapeutic window observed upon proteasomal blockade has motivated multiple UPS-targeting strategies, including preventing ubiquitination altogether. E1 initiates the cascade by transferring ubiquitin to E2 enzymes. A small molecule that engages the E1 ATP-binding site and derivatizes ubiquitin disrupts enzymatic activity and kills cancer cells. However, binding-site mutations cause resistance, motivating alternative approaches to block this promising target. We identified an interaction between the E2 N-terminal alpha-1 helix and a pocket within the E1 ubiquitin-fold domain as a potentially druggable site. Stapled peptides modeled after the E2 alpha-1 helix bound to the E1 groove, induced a consequential conformational change and inhibited E1 ubiquitin thiotransfer, disrupting E2 ubiquitin charging and ubiquitination of cellular proteins. Thus, we provide a blueprint for a distinct E1-targeting strategy to treat cancer. The interaction between E1 and E2 is targeted by a stapled peptide that mimics the alpha-1 helix of E2, resulting in blockade of ubiquitin transfer from E1 to E2."

Effectiveness, accessibility, safety and patient-centeredness were four dimensions that were most commonly measured. This paper develops a new consensus-based decision model to assess the health systems, in which different stakeholders of healthcare systems are identified by different decision approaches, i.e., the coefficient variation approach, the Shannon entropy approach and the distance-based approach, respectively. The consensus result is obtained by minimizing the total deviation from the ideal point. A numerical illustration with simulated data is presented to show the effectiveness of our model."
https://openalex.org/W3056512980,"The study assessed the prevalence and determinants of non-fistulous urinary incontinence among gynaecologic care seekers as well as its interference with everyday life activities of affected women. A cross-sectional study involving 400 women was conducted in a tertiary facility in Ghana. Urinary incontinence was assessed using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-short form (ICIQ-SF) which has not been validated locally. The questionnaire was administered mostly in the Asante Twi language with translation done at the time of the interview. The data was analysed for proportions and associations between selected variables. The prevalence of urinary incontinence was 12%, the common types being urgency (33.3%), stress (22.9%), and mixed (20.8%). Age ≥60 years compared to 18–39 years (OR 3.66 95%CI 1.48–9.00 P = 0.005), and a history of chronic cough (OR 3.80 95% CI 1.36–10.58 P = 0.01) were associated with urinary incontinence. Women with education beyond the basic level were 72% less likely to experience urinary incontinence (OR 0.28 95%CI 0.08–0.96 P = 0.04). Urinary incontinence interferes with everyday life activities of most affected women. Non-fistulous urinary incontinence is relatively common among gynaecologic care seekers yet very few women were referred with such a diagnosis. Advocacy measures aimed at urging affected women to report the condition and educating the general population on potential causes, prevention and treatment are needed."

Maximum esterase and α-amylase activity was found in Zygophyllum fabago (14.3±0.44 and 140±18.8 mg/g, respectively). Flavonoid content was high in T. pentandrus (666.1±49 μg/ml). The highest total phenolic content and tannin was revealed in F. olivieri (72125±425 and 37050±1900 μM/g, respectively). The highest value of ascorbic acid was depicted in F. bruguieri (F.b.N) (448±1.5 μg/g).

The maximum total antioxidant capacity was depicted in Tetraena simplex (16.9±0.01 μM/g). The highest value of lycopene and total carotenoids exhibited in T. terrestris (7.44±0.2 and 35.5±0.0 mg/g, respectively). Chlorophyll contents were found maximum in T. pentandrus var. pterophorus (549.1±9.9, 154.3±10, and 703.4±20.2 ug/g, respectively). All taxa exhibited anti-inflammatory activity and anti-diabetic potential. Z. eurypterum seeds exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory potential (96%), along with other taxa indicated (96–76%) activity when compared with the standard drug diclofenac sodium (79%). Seeds of T. pentandrus (85%) exhibited the highest anti-diabetic activity. The other taxa also exhibited inhibitory activity of α-amylase ranging from (85–69%) compared with Metformin (67%) standard drug.

https://openalex.org/W3077854652,"Periodontitis is a highly prevalent condition leading to a continuous destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. It increases the risk for various systemic diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, screening for periodontitis is important. Screening measures can range from self-reported symptoms to clinical full-mouth periodontal examination. The hypothesis of our study was that self-reported parameters and clinical definition perform equally well in identifying periodontitis patients. The aim of this study was to develop, validate its internal consistency, and evaluate a self-reported instrument against periodontal clinical evaluation for diagnosis of periodontitis in a group of postpartum women, as well as to describe their periodontal status and the risk factors associated with periodontal disease. A cross-sectional study on postpartum women was conducted in a tertiary university hospital, from April 2018 to March 2019. Sociodemographic and behavioral data, periodontal clinical parameters, and self-reported periodontal perception were collected. A 16-item questionnaire was developed to obtain information about perceived periodontal alterations and oral hygiene habits. The utility of the questionnaire was tested against a periodontal diagnosis based on a full-mouth periodontal examination. The questionnaire was applied in 215 postpartum women aged 29.16±5.54 years (mean age (y) ± standard deviation) having the following periodontal status: 16 individuals without periodontal disease (7.44%), 32 individuals with gingivitis (14.88%), 19 individuals with mild periodontitis (8.84%), 132 individuals with moderate periodontitis (61.39%), and 16 individuals with severe periodontitis (7.44%). A significant association was observed between oral hygiene score, smoking status, and periodontal conditions (p<0.05). A significant association between the self-reported items related to “gum swelling”, “halitosis”, “previous periodontal diagnosis” and “previous periodontal treatment” with clinical periodontitis have been identified (p<0.05). Using self-reported questionnaires for detection of periodontal disease was ineffective in our studied population, since self-reported parameters and clinical definition do not appear to perform equally in identifying periodontitis cases. Clinical periodontal examination remains the gold standard for screening. Periodontitis was frequent in our group and the severity was significantly associated with the oral hygiene score and smoking. These results underline the necessity for periodontal clinical examination during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3057709384,"Bacterial group II introns mostly behave as versatile retromobile genetic elements going through distinct cycles of gain and loss. These large RNA molecules are also ribozymes splicing autocatalytically from their interrupted pre-mRNA transcripts by two different concurrent pathways, branching and circularization. These two splicing pathways were shown to release in bacterial cells significant amounts of branched intron lariats and perfect end-to-end intron circles respectively. On one hand, released intron lariats can invade new sites in RNA and/or DNA by reverse branching while released intron circles are dead end spliced products since they cannot reverse splice through circularization. The presence of two parallel and competing group II intron splicing pathways in bacteria led us to investigate the conditions that influence the overall circle to lariat ratio in vivo. Here we unveil that removing a prominent processing site within the Ll.LtrB group II intron, raising growth temperature of Lactococcus lactis host cells and increasing the expression level of the intron-interrupted gene all increased the relative amount of released intron circles compared to lariats. Strengthening and weakening the base pairing interaction between the intron and its upstream exon respectively increased and decreased the overall levels of released intron circles in comparison to lariats. Host environment was also found to impact the circle to lariat ratio of the Ll.LtrB and Ll.RlxA group II introns from L. lactis and the Ef.PcfG intron from Enterococcus faecalis. Overall, our data show that multiple factors significantly influence the balance between released intron circles and lariats in bacterial cells."
https://openalex.org/W3059780353,"Anomia is common in Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), and there is considerable evidence that semantic problems (as opposed to impaired access to output word phonology) exist in many PPA individuals irrespective of their strict subtype, including a loss of representations from semantic memory, which is typical for people with the semantic variant of PPA. In this manuscript we present a straightforward novel clinical algorithm that quantifies this degree of semantic storage impairment. We sought to produce an algorithm by employing tasks that would measure key elements of semantic storage loss: a) whether an unrecalled name could be retrieved with cues; b) if performance for items was consistent across tasks; and c) the degree to which a participant’s performance was related to general severity of cognitive impairment rather than semantic loss. More specifically, these tasks were given to 28 individuals with PPA (12 participants had a clinical diagnosis of atypical Alzheimer’s Disease with the logopenic variant of PPA; the remaining 16 participants received a clinical diagnosis of Frontotemporal dementia (11 were classified as the non-fluent variant of PPA and five were the semantic variant of PPA). Scores from these tasks produced a single omnibus semantic memory storage loss score (SSL score) for each person that ranged from 0.0 to 1.0, with scores closer to 0 more indicative of semantic storage loss. Indeed, supporting the hypothesis that our scores measure the degree of semantic storage loss, we found participants with the semantic variant of PPA had the lowest scores, and SSL scores could predict the degree of hypometabolism in the anterior temporal lobe; even when only people with the logopenic variant of PPA were examined. Thus, these scores show promise quantitating the degree of a person’s semantic representation loss."
https://openalex.org/W3059332464,"The effect of spatial contexts on attention is important for evaluating the risk of human errors and the accessibility of information in different situations. In traditional studies, this effect has been investigated using display-based and non-laboratory procedures. However, these two procedures are inadequate for measuring attention directed toward 360-degree environments and controlling exogeneous stimuli. In order to resolve these limitations, we used a virtual-reality-based procedure and investigated how spatial contexts of 360-degree environments influence attention. In the experiment, 20 students were asked to search for and report a target that was presented at any location in 360-degree virtual spaces as accurately and quickly as possible. Spatial contexts comprised a basic context (a grey and objectless space) and three specific contexts (a square grid floor, a cubic room, and an infinite floor). We found that response times for the task and eye movements were influenced by the spatial context of 360-degree surrounding spaces. In particular, although total viewing times for the contexts did not match the saliency maps, the differences in total viewing times between the basic and specific contexts did resemble the maps. These results suggest that attention comprises basic and context-dependent characteristics, and the latter are influenced by the saliency of 360-degree contexts even when the contexts are irrelevant to a task."
https://openalex.org/W3070329976,"Various traditions have investigated the relationship between emotion and language. For the basic emotions view, emotional prototypes are lexically sedimented in language, evidenced in cultural convergence in emotional recognition and expression tasks. For constructionist theories, conceptual knowledge supported by language is at the core of emotions. Understanding emotion words is embedded in various interrelated constructs such as emotional intelligence, emotion knowledge or emotion differentiation, and is related to, but different from, general vocabulary. A clear advantage of Emotion Vocabulary over most emotion-related constructs is that it can be measured objectively. In two successive corpus-based studies, we tested the predictions of concordance and absolute agreement on the frequency of use of a total of 100 Spanish emotion labels in the eight main Spanish-speaking areas: Spain, Mexico-Central America, River Plate, Continental Caribbean, Andean, Antilles, Chilean, and the United States. In both studies, the intraclass correlation coefficient was statistically different from the null and very large, over .95, as was the Kendall's concordance coefficient, indicating broad consensus among the Spanish linguistic areas. From an applied perspective, our results provide supporting evidence for the similarity in frequency, and therefore cross-cultural generalizability regarding familiarity of the 100 emotion labels as item stems or as experimental stimuli without going through a process of additional adaptation. On a broader scope, these results add evidence on the role of language for emotion theories. In this regard, countries and regions compared here share the same Spanish language, but differ in several aspects in history, culture, and socio-economic structure."
https://openalex.org/W3052096908,"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite infecting up to one third of the human population. The central event in the pathogenesis of toxoplasmosis is the conversion of tachyzoites into encysted bradyzoites. A novel approach to analyze the structure of in vivo-derived tissue cysts may be the increasingly used computational image analysis. The objective of this study was to quantify the geometrical complexity of T. gondii cysts by morphological, particle, and fractal analysis, as well as to determine if it is impacted by parasite strain, cyst age, and host type. A total of 31 images of T. gondii brain cysts of four type-2 strains (Me49, and local isolates BGD1, BGD14, and BGD26) was analyzed using ImageJ software. The parameters of interest included diameter, circularity, packing density (PD), fractal dimension (FD), and lacunarity. Although cyst diameter varied widely, its negative correlation with PD was observed. Circularity was remarkably close to 1, indicating a perfectly round shape of the cysts. PD and FD did not vary among cysts of different strains, age, and derived from mice of different genetic background. Conversely, lacunarity, which is a measure of heterogeneity, was significantly lower for BGD1 strain vs. all other strains, and higher for Me49 vs. BGD14 and BGD26, but did not differ among Me49 cysts of different age, or those derived from genetically different mice. The results indicate a highly uniform structure and occupancy of the different T. gondii tissue cysts. This study furthers the use of image analysis in describing the structural complexity of T. gondii cyst morphology, and presents the first application of fractal analysis for this purpose. The presented results show that use of a freely available software is a cost-effective approach to advance automated image scoring for T. gondii cysts."
https://openalex.org/W3064057857,"Two common ecological assumptions are that host generalist and rare species are poorer competitors relative to host specialist and more abundant counterparts. While these assumptions have received considerable study in both plant and animals, how they apply to ectomycorrhizal fungi remains largely unknown. To investigate how interspecific competition may influence the anomalous host associations of the rare ectomycorrhizal generalist fungus, Suillus subaureus, we conducted a seedling bioassay. Pinus strobus seedlings were inoculated in single- or two-species treatments of three Suillus species: S. subaureus, S. americanus, and S. spraguei. After 4 and 8 months of growth, seedlings were harvested and scored for mycorrhizal colonization as well as dry biomass. At both time points, we found a clear competitive hierarchy among the three ectomycorrhizal fungal species: S. americanus > S. subaureus > S. spraguei, with the competitive inferior, S. spraguei, having significantly delayed colonization relative to S. americanus and S. subaureus. In the single-species treatments, we found no significant differences in the dry biomasses of P. strobus seedlings colonized by each Suillus species, suggesting none was a more effective plant symbiont. Taken together, these results indicate that the rarity and anomalous host associations exhibited by S. subaureus in natural settings are not driven by inherently poor competitive ability or host growth promotion, but that the timing of colonization is a key factor determining the outcome of ectomycorrhizal fungal competitive interactions."

In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published a guideline on acute bronchiolitis which has gained global acceptance. We hypothesized that a publication gap, which is increasingly perceived in clinical medicine, might have also affected these universal recommendations.We determined the proportion of published and unpublished studies registered at ClinicalTrials.gov that were marked as completed by October 1st 2018. The major trial and literature databases were used to search for publications. In addition, the study investigators were contacted directly.Of the 69 registered studies on the treatment of acute viral bronchiolitis, only 50 (72%) have been published by November 2019. Published trials contained data from n = 9403 patients, whereas n = 4687 patients were enrolled in unpublished trials. Median time to publication was 20 months, and only 8 of 50 trials were published within 12 months after completion. Only 40% of the clinical trials that were completed after the release of the AAP guideline were subsequently published as compared to 80% before 2014.There is a significant publication gap regarding therapy of acute viral bronchiolitis that may have influenced certain recommendations of the AAP guideline. In turn, recommendations of the guideline might have discouraged investigators to publish their results after its release."
