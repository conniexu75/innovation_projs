https://openalex.org/W2061569374,"Canalicular secretion of bile salts is a vital function of the vertebrate liver, yet the molecular identity of the involved ATP-dependent carrier protein has not been elucidated. We cloned the full-length cDNA of the sister of P-glycoprotein (spgp; Mr ∼160,000) of rat liver and demonstrated that it functions as an ATP-dependent bile salt transporter in cRNA injectedXenopus laevis oocytes and in vesicles isolated from transfected Sf9 cells. The latter demonstrated a 5-fold stimulation of ATP-dependent taurocholate transport as compared with controls. This spgp-mediated taurocholate transport was stimulated solely by ATP, was inhibited by vanadate, and exhibited saturability with increasing concentrations of taurocholate (Km ≃ 5 μm). Furthermore, spgp-mediated transport rates of various bile salts followed the same order of magnitude as ATP-dependent transport in canalicular rat liver plasma membrane vesicles, i.e.taurochenodeoxycholate > tauroursodeoxycholate = taurocholate > glycocholate = cholate. Tissue distribution assessed by Northern blotting revealed predominant, if not exclusive, expression of spgp in the liver, where it was further localized to the canalicular microvilli and to subcanalicular vesicles of the hepatocytes by in situ immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling studies. These results indicate that the sister of P-glycoprotein is the major canalicular bile salt export pump of mammalian liver.

Bile formation is an important function of vertebrate liver (1Oude Elferink R.P.J. Meijer D.K.F. Kuipers F. Jansen P.L.M. Groen A.K. Grotthuis G.M.M. Biochim. Biophys.

It is mediated by hepatocytes that generate bile flow within bile canaliculi by continuous vectorial secretion of bile salts and other solutes across their canalicular (apical) membrane (2Nathanson M.H. Boyer J.L. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 551-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Studies in isolated membrane vesicles of rat and human livers have shown that canalicular bile salt transport is an ATP-dependent process (3Adachi Y. Kobayashi H. Kurumi Y. Shouji M. Kitano M.

However, the molecular identity of the primary active canalicular bile salt transporter or bile salt export pump (BSEP) 1The abbreviations use are: BSEP, bile salt export pump of mammalian liver; ABC, ATP binding cassette; BAT1, bile acid transporter of S. cerevisiae; mdr1a/1b, rodent isoforms of the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein; mdr2, phospholipid-transporting mdr isoform of rodent liver; MRP1, human multidrug resistance protein 1; MRP2/mrp2, human/rat canalicular multidrug resistance protein; spgp, sister of P-glycoprotein; BSEP/spgp, identity of spgp and BSEP; PFIC, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis; bp base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s)., 2BSEP rather than cBAT (9Suchy F.J.

Furthermore, the term “export pump” points to ATP as the primary driving force of the canalicular bile salt transporter.has not yet been elucidated (8Meier P.J. Am. J.

Although the canalicular ecto-ATPase has been proposed as a possible candidate (9Suchy F.J. Sippel C.J. Ananthanarayanan M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Sippel C.J. McCollum M.J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol.

Lomri N. DeVoss J. Xie M.H. Hua T. Lidofsky S.D. Scharschmidt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Luther T.T. Hammermann P.

This assumption has recently been further supported by the cloning of an ATP-dependent bile salt transporter fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (13Ortiz D.F. St. Pierre M.V. Abdulmassih A. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15358-15365Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This yeast bile salt transporter (BAT1) belongs to a subgroup of ABC-type proteins that includes also the canalicular multiorganic anion transporter or multidrug resistance protein MRP2 (human)/mrp2 (rat) (14Müller M.

Although MRP2/mrp2 mediates canalicular excretion of a broad range of divalent amphipathic anionic conjugates (1Oude Elferink R.P.J. Meijer D.K.F. Kuipers F. Jansen P.L.M. Groen A.K. Grotthuis G.M.M.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, we designed degenerate oligonucleotide primers spanning the Walker A and B motifs of ABC proteins and performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactin with total rat liver mRNA. One of the amplified fragments revealed an 88% identity with the published pig liver cDNA-fragment of the so called “sister of P-glycoprotein” (spgp), a novel putative canalicular ABC transporter of unknown function (19Childs S. Yeh R.L. Georges E. Ling V. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2029-2034PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the full-length isolation of spgp from rat liver, demonstrate its function as an ATP-dependent bile salt transporter in cRNA-injectedXenopus laevis oocytes and in transfected Sf9 cells, and document its subcellular localization at the canalicular microvilli and at subcanalicular smooth membrane vesicles of rat hepatocytes using immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy. [3H]Taurocholic acid (2.1–4.6 Ci/mmol), [3H]cholic acid (13.2 Ci/mmol), and [4C]glycocholic acid (44.6 mCi/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. 3H-Labeled taurochenodeoxycholic and tauroursodeoxycholic acids of high specific activity (2–60 Ci/mmol) were prepared as described previously (20Kullak-Ublick G.A.

Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 589-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and were readily available from commercial sources. A cDNA probe spanning the Walker A and B motifs of ABC proteins was constructed by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of rat liver poly(A)+ RNA using the following primers: forward primers, GGCGGATCCTCIGGIKSIGGIAARAGYAC and GGCGGATCCTCIGGIKSIGGIAARTCIIC; reverse primers, CGGGAATTCTCIARIGCRCTIACIGSYTCRTC, CGGGAATTCTCIARIGCRCTIGTIGSYTCRTC, CGGGAATTCTCIARIGCICAIACIGSYTCRTC, and CGGGAATTCTCIARIGCIGAIGTIGSYTCRTC. After cloning and sequencing a single polymerase chain reaction product of 430 bp was identified that revealed an 88% identity to the published portion of the pig liver spgp cDNA (19Childs S. Yeh R.L. Georges E. Ling V. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2029-2034PubMed Google Scholar). It was used to sequentially isolate the full-length spgp cDNA from two cDNA libraries constructed from total rat liver mRNA with the Superscript Plasmid System (Life Technologies, Inc.) and from size-fractionated poly(A+) RNA (4.0–6.0 kb) using the ZAP ExpressTM cDNA Synthesis and ZAP ExpressTM cDNA Gigapack III Gold Cloning kits (Stratagene), respectively. The final single clone was sequenced by Microsynth Gmbh (Balgach, Switzerland). Oocytes were prepared, injected with cRNAs, cultured, and preloaded with 28.5 pmol of [3H]taurocholate (60 nl of 475 μm[3H]taurocholate (2.1 Ci/mmol)) as described elsewhere (23Hagenbuch B.

The Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to generate the recombinant baculovirus. Sf9 cells were infected with virus and kept in culture (27 °C, air) for 72 h. Thereafter, Sf9 cells were scraped from culture dishes, centrifuged at 1400 × gav, and homogenized with a glass-Teflon tissue homogenizer in 50 mm mannitol, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 1 μg/ml leupeptin/antipain, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (25Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Undisrupted cells, nuclear debris, and large mitochondria were pelleted at 500 × gavfor 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × gav. The resulting pellet was resuspended in taurocholate uptake buffer consisting of 50 mm sucrose, 100 mm KNO3, 12.5 mmMg(NO3)2, and 10 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4. The vesicles were stored frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein was determined using the BCA assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

A polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits against an oligopeptide containing the C-terminal 13 amino acids coupled via cysteine to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Neosystem, Strasbourg, France) and used for Western blotting as described previously (27Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Landmann L. Höchli M. Schroeder A. Meier P.J. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1781-1787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) (∼2 μg of poly(A+) RNA per lane) was hybridized with the full-length spgp cDNA clone or with a β-actin probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C overnight in Amersham hybridization buffer. The blot was washed at 68 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Immunofluorescence studies (27Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Landmann L. Höchli M. Schroeder A. Meier P.J. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1781-1787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and immunogold electron microscopy studies on ultrathin frozen-thawed sections of perfusion-fixed (3% formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde) liver were performed as described previously (28Tokuyasu K. Histochem. J. 1989; 21: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 29Lackie P.M. Zuber C. Roth J. Development. 1990; 110: 933-947PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated full-length spgp cDNA 3The nucleotide sequence of the full-length spgp cDNA clone coding for the deduced amino acid sequence is deposited in the GenBankTM under accession number U69487. contained 5,036 base pairs and encoded a polypeptide of 1321 amino acids with 12 putative membrane-spanning domains, four predictedN-glycosylation sites in the first extracellular loop, and the typical structural features of ABC-transporting polypeptides (Fig. 1). Comparison of the full-length amino acid sequence with other members of the ABC-transporter superfamily revealed the following similarities/identities to spgp: mdr1a (mouse) 71%/50%, mdr1b (rat) 70%/49%, mdr2 (rat) 69%/48%, MRP1 (human) 51%/26%, mrp2 (rat) 49%/25%, BAT1 48%/23%, and cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (mouse) 48%/22%. These data confirm the close homology of spgp to the MDR/mdr gene family (19Childs S. Yeh R.L. Georges E. Ling V. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2029-2034PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate its function, spgp was expressed in X. laevisoocytes (18Madon J. Eckhardt U. Gerloff T. Stieger B. Meier P.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and in Sf9 cells. As illustrated in Fig. 2, an approximately 1.5-fold increase in [3H]taurocholate efflux was observed in spgp cRNA-injected oocytes as compared with water- and mrp2 cRNA-injected oocytes (18Madon J. Eckhardt U. Gerloff T. Stieger B. Meier P.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, membrane vesicles isolated from spgp cDNA-infected Sf9 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”) demonstrated marked ATP-dependent uptake of taurocholate, whereas control vesicles from wild type cells (or cells infected with wild type or with β-galactosidase-containing baculovirus; data not shown) did not (Fig. 3 A). Initial rates of this spgp-mediated, ATP-dependent [3H]taurocholate uptake exhibited saturability with increasing concentrations of taurocholate (Km value ∼5.3 μm) (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, only minimal or no stimulation of [3H]taurocholate uptake into spgp expressing Sf9 vesicles was observed with other nucleotides (UTP, CTP, and GTP), ATP degradation products (ADP, AMP, and adenosine), or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs (adenosine-5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate and adenosine-5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate) (data not shown). Also, increasing concentrations of vanadate between 5 μm and 100 μm inhibited ATP-dependent [3H]taurocholate uptake between 32% and 63%. And finally, comparison of initial ATP-dependent uptake rates (linear time-dependent uptake phase) of various bile salt derivatives in spgp-expressing Sf9 cell vesicles and in isolated canalicular liver plasma membrane vesicles (6Stieger B. O'Neill B. Meier P.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) showed the highest ATP-dependent uptake rate for taurochenodeoxycholate followed by tauroursodeoxycholate and taurocholate in both vesicle preparations (Table I). In contrast, glycocholate and cholate were less efficiently transported in canalicular vesicles, and no ATP-dependent transport of these bile salt derivatives could be detected in spgp-expressing Sf9 cell vesicles. These latter results most probably resulted from the overall lower expression of ATP-dependent bile salt transport activities in spgp-expressing Sf9 cells compared with canalicular vesicles (Table I), thus preventing the detection of low residual spgp-mediated cholate and glycocholate transport.Figure 3ATP-dependent taurocholate transport in membrane vesicles isolated from spgp-expressing Sf9 cells. A, effect of ATP on taurocholate uptake. Membrane vesicles isolated from wild type (control) and spgp-expressing Sf9 cells were incubated in 50 mm sucrose, 100 mm KNO3, 12.5 mmMg(NO3)2, and 10 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 μm[3H]taurocholate. Vesicle uptake of [3H]taurocholate was determined in the presence and absence of ATP (5 mm) (6Stieger B. O'Neill B. Meier P.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). ○, control vesicles without ATP; •, control vesicles with ATP; □, spgp-expressing vesicles without ATP, ▪, spgp-expressing vesicles with ATP.

Open table in a new tab To directly correlate transport activity with protein expression in Sf9 cells, a polyclonal antiserum against the C-terminal 13 amino acids of BSEP/spgp was raised in rabbits. The antiserum recognized a predominant protein band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼140 kDa (140.5 ± 2.7; mean ± SD, n = 3) in vesicles isolated from BSEP/spgp cDNA-transfected Sf9 cells (Fig. 4 A, lane 2), but not in vesicles isolated from wild type cells (Fig. 4 A, lane 1) nor in vesicles isolated from Sf9 cells infected with wild type or with β-galactosidase containing baculovirus (data not shown). Thus, the expression of BSEP/spgp correlates with ATP-dependent taurocholate transport. An immunopositive protein band was also observed in canalicular, but not in basolateral plasma membrane vesicles isolated from rat liver (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and 4). This canalicular form of BSEP/spgp exhibited a slightly higher molecular mass of ∼160 kDa (157.4 ± 3.1; mean ± SD, n = 3), which most probably reflects a differentN-linked glycosylation pattern of hepatocytes as compared with Sf9 cells (25Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on Northern blot analysis of various rat tissue mRNAs, BSEP/spgp is predominantly, if not exclusively, expressed in the liver (Fig. 4 B). When tested for its presence in other animal species the BSEP/spgp cDNA yielded positive hybridization reactions also with mRNAs of mouse (∼5.0 kb), chicken (∼2.0 kb), and turtle (∼4.0 kb) livers (data not shown), indicating the occurrence of BSEP/spgp-related proteins also in lower vertebrates. The cellular and subcellular distribution of BSEP/spgp in rat liver was further investigated by immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy. At low magnification positive immunoreactivity was confined homogenously to bile canaliculi of periportal and perivenous hepatocytes (data not shown). No immunoreactivity was detected in bile ductular epithelial cells. Within bile canaliculi the immunoreactivity for BSEP/spgp was predominantly associated with the canalicular microvilli, while the smooth intermicrovillar plasma membrane regions were essentially free of gold particle labeling (Fig. 4, Cand D). No labeling was found along the basolateral plasma membrane of hepatocytes. Intracellularly, gold particle labeling was associated with subplasmalemmal smooth membrane vesicles, lucent vacuoles probably representing endosomes (Fig. 4, E and F) and the Golgi apparatus. This study has identified spgp (19Childs S. Yeh R.L. Georges E. Ling V. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2029-2034PubMed Google Scholar) as a canalicular ATP-dependent BSEP of mammalian liver. This conclusion is derived from the functional expression of the full-length BSEP/spgp cDNA in X. laevis oocytes (Fig. 2) and in Sf9 insect cells (Figs. 3 and 4 A). Vesicles isolated from BSEP/spgp-overexpressing Sf9 cells exhibited similar high affinity ATP-dependent taurocholate uptake (Km = ∼5.3 μm) (Fig. 3 B) as previously determined under identical conditions in canalicular rat liver plasma membrane vesicles (Km = ∼2.1 μm) (6Stieger B. O'Neill B. Meier P.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Since canalicular secretion represents the rate-limiting step in the overall transport of bile salts from sinusoidal blood plasma into bile (2Nathanson M.H. Boyer J.L. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 551-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 8Meier P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G801-G812PubMed Google Scholar), its high affinity for taurocholate indicates that BSEP/spgp represents the major canalicular bile salt transporter of rat liver. Based on Northern blot analysis, BSEP/spgp is predominantly, if not exclusively expressed in the liver (Fig. 4 B) (19Childs S. Yeh R.L. Georges E. Ling V. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2029-2034PubMed Google Scholar). This organ-selective expression of BSEP/spgp is not astonishing considering its bile salt transport function. However, BSEP/spgp-related proteins appear also to occur in the livers of other vertebrates including chicken and turtle (this study) as well as the winter flounder (34Chan K.M.C. Davies P.L. Childs S. Veinot L. Ling V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), supporting the concept that the origin of the BSEP/spgp gene predates the divergence of fish and mammals (19Childs S. Yeh R.L. Georges E. Ling V. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2029-2034PubMed Google Scholar) and that BSEP/spgp mediates the transport of C27 bile acids (present in turtle) as well as C24 bile acids (present in most mammals and chickens). Finally, Western blot analysis as well as immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling studies demonstrated the selective localization of BSEP/spgp at the canalicular microvilli (Fig. 4, A,C, and D) and at subcanalicular smooth membrane vesicles (Fig. 4, E and F) of rat hepatocytes. Since infusion of taurocholate into intact animals has been shown to increase the canalicular bile salt transport capacity (2Nathanson M.H. Boyer J.L. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 551-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 35Gatmaitan Z.C. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1041-G1049PubMed Google Scholar), the labeled subcanalicular endosomes might represent a regulatory carrier pool that could be rapidly inserted into the canalicular plasma membrane under high bile salt load conditions. The full length of the rat liver BSEP/spgp represents a canalicular protein with a molecular mass of ∼160 kDa (Fig. 4 A). Its homology to the MDR/mdr gene family is in contrast to the closer relatedness of the recently cloned yeast BAT1 with the MRP/mrp gene family of ABC transporters (13Ortiz D.F. St. Pierre M.V.

Since mammalian MRP/mrp analogues do not mediate transport of monovalent bile salt derivatives (1Oude Elferink R.P.J. Meijer D.K.F. Kuipers F. Jansen P.L.M. Groen A.K. Grotthuis G.M.M. Biochim.

Gerloff T. Stieger B. Meier P.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and since BAT1 has been shown to exhibit an approximately 12-fold lower affinity for taurocholate (Km = ∼63 μm) (13Ortiz D.F. St. Pierre M.V. Abdulmassih A. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15358-15365Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as compared with BSEP/spgp (Fig. 3 B), the participation ofBAT1-related gene products in bile salt transport in mammalian liver seems unlikely. Furthermore, since fungi are thought to be devoid of bile salts, the true endogenous substrate(s) of BAT1 as well as the functional significance of bile salt transport in yeast remain unclear. Nevertheless, ATP-dependent taurocholate transport has also been demonstrated in plant vacuoles despite the absence of typical bile salts in plant tissue (36Hortensteiner S. Vogt E. Hagenbuch B Meier P.J. Amrhein N. Martinoia E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18446-18449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, amphipathic bile salt transport might be a nonspecific “bystander” function of several multispecific ABC-type transporters in a variety of biological tissues. In contrast, ongoing bile salt secretion serves an essential function in mammalian liver, where it mediates phospholipid and cholesterol excretion and water flow into bile canaliculi. Furthermore, in vertebrates bile salts are 100–1000-fold concentrated in bile as compared with plasma, stimulate absorption of lipids from the intestine and undergo efficient enterohepatic circulation (2Nathanson M.H. Boyer J.L. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 551-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 8Meier P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G801-G812PubMed Google Scholar, 9Suchy F.J. Sippel C.J. Ananthanarayanan M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that vertebrates have developed a separate high affinity bile salt export pump within the large superfamily of ABC-type proteins. Several observations from this and other recent studies strongly indicate that BSEP/spgp represents the major, if not the only bile salt export pump in mammalian liver. First, BSEP/spgp-mediated bile salt transport exhibits similar kinetics (see above) and similar substrate preference (Table I) as ATP-dependent bile salt transport in canalicular liver plasma membrane vesicles (6Stieger B. O'Neill B. Meier P.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Second, preferential BSEP/spgp-mediated transport of the dihydroxy-conjugated bile salt taurochenodeoxycholate is consistent with the preferential secretion and transport of this bile salt in the isolated perfused liver and in canalicular plasma membrane vesicles (37Bolder U. Ton-Nu H.T. Schteingart C.D. Frick E. Hofmann A.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 214-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Third, in contrast to the ecto-ATPase canalicular expression of BSEP/spgp is decreased in various forms of cholestatic liver disease (38Müller M. Vos T.A. Roelofsen H. van Goor H. Moshage H.

Moshage H. Kuipers F. Jansen P.L.M. J. Hepatol. 1997; 26 (abstr.): 71Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Fourth, overexpression of BSEP/spgp is associated with increased bile salt secretion in a gallstone susceptible mouse strain (41Lammert F. Beier D.R. Wang D.O.H. Carey M.C. Paigen B. Cohen D.E. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 358ACrossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). And fifth, the BSEP/spgp gene is localized on the same chromosome (chromosome 2) as the locus for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis PFIC2 (41Lammert F. Beier D.R. Wang D.O.H. Carey M.C.

These patients secrete exceptionally low levels of conjugated primary bile salts into bile and have particularly low levels of biliary chenodeoxycholic acid (45Jacquemin E. Dumont M. Bernard O.

In fact, and most importantly, in preliminary studies missense mutations of the human liver SPGPgene have been identified as the most probable cause of PFIC linked to the PFIC2 locus (42Thompson R.J.

These very recent developments corroborate the findings presented in this study and further support the conclusion that BSEP/spgp represents the major, if not the only canalicular bile salt transporter of mammalian liver."

HFE binds to transferrin receptor (TfR) and reduces its affinity for iron-loaded transferrin, implicating HFE in iron metabolism. The 2.6 Å crystal structure of HFE reveals the locations of hemochromatosis mutations and a patch of histidines that could be involved in pH-dependent interactions. We also demonstrate that soluble TfR and HFE bind tightly at the basic pH of the cell surface, but not at the acidic pH of intracellular vesicles. TfR:HFE stoichiometry (2:1) differs from TfR:transferrin stoichiometry (2:2), implying a different mode of binding for HFE and transferrin to TfR, consistent with our demonstration that HFE, transferrin, and TfR form a ternary complex."

Receptor substitution experiments that replace the P2 gene with the coding region of the P3 gene result in the projection of P3-->P2 axons to a glomerulus touching the wild-type P3 glomerulus. These data, along with additional receptor substitutions, indicate that the odorant receptor plays an instructive role in the establishment of the topographic map."

Evidence supporting TXBP181 as HsMAD1 includes sequence conservation with yeast MAD1, hyperphosphorylation during S/G2/M phases and upon treatment of cells with nocodazole, and binding to HsMAD2. HsMAD1 functions as a homodimer. It localizes to the centrosome during metaphase and to the spindle midzone and the midbody during anaphase and telophase. Expression of either Tax or a transdominant-negative TXBP181 results in multinucleated cells, a phenotype consistent with a loss of HsMAD1 function. We propose a model of viral transformation in which Tax targets TXBP181, thereby abrogating a mitotic checkpoint."

DNA sequence analysis identified two different mutations, accounting for all affected individuals in nine families studied. Immunofluorescence and Western analysis of immortalized lymphocytes from patients homozygous for either of the two mutations demonstrate complete lack of expression of the mutated gene in these cells.

https://openalex.org/W2019328429,"Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases-1 and -2 (PGHS-1 and -2) are the major targets of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen. These enzymes catalyze the committed step in the formation of prostanoids from arachidonic acid. Although PGHS-1 and -2 are similar biochemically, a number of studies suggest that PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 function independently to form prostanoids that subserve different cellular functions. We have hypothesized that these isozymes may reside, at least in part, in different subcellular compartments and that their compartmentation may affect their access to arachidonic acid and serve to separate the functions of the enzymes. To obtain high resolution data on the subcellular locations of PGHS-1 and -2, we employed immunoelectron microscopy with multiple antibodies specific to each isozyme. Both PGHS-1 and -2 were found on the lumenal surfaces of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope of human monocytes, murine NIH 3T3 cells, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Within the nuclear envelope, PGHS-1 and -2 were present on both the inner and outer nuclear membranes and in similar proportions. Western blotting data showed a similar distribution of PGHS-1 and -2 in subcellular fractions, and product analysis using isozyme-specific inhibitors suggested that both enzymes generate the same products in NIH 3T3 cells. Thus, we are unable to attribute the independent functioning of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 to differences in their subcellular locations. Instead, the independent operation of these isozymes may be attributable to subtle kinetic differences (e.g. negative allosteric regulation of PGHS-1 at low concentrations of arachidonate (500–1000 nm)). A further conclusion of importance from a cell biological perspective is that membrane proteins such as PGHS-1 and -2, which are located on the lumenal surface of the ER, are able to diffuse freely among the ER and the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope.

Two biochemically similar enzymes with markedly different patterns of expression catalyze the committed step in the formation of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid.

Biologically active prostanoids including PGE2, PGF2, PGI2, PGD2, and thromboxane A2 are then formed by specific prostaglandin synthases. PGHS-1 is expressed constitutively in nearly all mammalian tissues and forms prostanoids central to several housekeeping functions including water reabsorption in the kidney, vascular homeostasis, and platelet aggregation. PGHS-2, although absent from most cells, can be rapidly and dramatically induced in many cell types upon treatment with inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters (2Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). PGHS-1 and -2 share 60% primary sequence identity (3Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W.

There are, however, sequence differences near the active site resulting in subtle differences in substrate specificities and differential sensitivities to various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (10Laneuville O.

These differences have been exploited in preparing a new generation of selective inhibitors of PGHS-2 that may inhibit pain, inflammation, and tumorigenesis while preserving the capacity of PGHS-1 to synthesize housekeeping prostanoids. Despite their many biochemical similarities, results of several experiments make it difficult to argue that PGHS-2 exists primarily to augment the biosynthetic capacity of PGHS-1 (see “Discussion” in Ref. 12Morita I.

PGHS expression patterns and apparently differential access to cellular pools of arachidonate (13Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol.

The inducible expression of PGHS-2, which is encoded by an immediate early gene, occurs in conjunction with nuclear events such as cell differentiation and replication (2Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Consequently, the inducible enzyme, especially the subset of enzyme molecules localized to the nuclear envelope, has been hypothesized to be the major source of prostanoids involved in a putative peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-mediated nuclear signaling system (16Kliewer S.A.

Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are both integral membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope (12Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10902-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Based on previous confocal immunolocalization work from our laboratory, we suggested that differential compartmentation of the two isozymes may serve, at least in part, to separate the activities of PGHS-1 and -2 within cells (12Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10902-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Although both enzymes are present in the ER and nuclear envelope, the conclusion of the earlier work was that PGHS-2 was preferentially associated with the nuclear envelope (12Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10902-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), whereas PGHS-1 was equally distributed between the ER and nuclear envelope. To test this model, we used immunoelectron microscopy and Western blotting of PGHS-1 and -2 in subcellular fractions. In addition, to test for isozyme-specific channeling of PGH2 to downstream PG synthases, we analyzed the prostanoid products formed by PGHS-1 and -2. Immunogold labeling experiments revealed that both enzymes are on the outer nuclear membrane; this was expected due to the continuity of this membrane with the ER (19Matsuura S. Masuda R. Sakai O. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1983; 8: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Somewhat to our surprise, both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 were also present on the inner nuclear membrane. Overall, our studies have indicated that the locations of the isozymes and the nature of the products are the same for both PGHS-1 and -2. All materials were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from several healthy human volunteers. Heparinized blood was diluted 1:1 in Hanks' balanced salts solution (HBSS, Life Technologies, Inc.) and spun against a Ficol-Hypaque (LSM-Organon Teknika) gradient for 20 min at 500 × g. PBMCs were isolated as a band from the interface and washed 2 × with HBSS before resuspension in 10 ml of RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% autologous serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml). Cells (106/ml) were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS; from Jayne Chen at Merck) and incubated with gentle agitation in a water-saturated 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for 24 h. Fixation was performed after LPS- or vehicle-stimulated cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in appropriate media (see below). Monocytes comprise 5–8% of PBMCs. Most of the other cells in PBMC preparations are T and B lymphocytes that do not normally express PGHSs and, therefore, provide a convenient internal negative control against PGHS immunostaining. Because ultrathin sectioning makes possible the observation of more than one section from a given cell, care was taken to use several different samples in the interest of gathering data from many different cells. PBMCs from each volunteer were separated into between 5 and 10 separate pellets per experiment. Between every few grids of thin sections taken from a single pellet, several thick (1 μm) sections were cut to maximize the number of different cells observed per experiment. Murine NIH 3T3 cells express PGHS-1 constitutively (20DeWitt D.L. Meade E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Serum-starved, quiescent 3T3 cells were cultured and then stimulated by the addition of 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT) for 3 h to induce PGHS-2 as described previously (20DeWitt D.L. Meade E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). After serum stimulation, cells from five 100-mm culture dishes were removed from the growing surface with a rubber policeman, resuspended in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and immediately fixed (see below). HUVECs (Cell Systems, Seattle, WA) were thawed from stocks frozen at passage 1 and expanded through passage 3–4 as suggested by the manufacturer. After stimulation for 20 h with 10 ng/ml IL-1β, cells were removed from culture dishes with a rubber policeman, immediately resuspended in CS-C media (Cell Systems, Seattle, WA), and fixed (see below). Previous PGHS immunolocalization experiments on both adherant and detached cells gave similar results, suggesting that removal of cells from the growing surface does not affect the localization of PGHS-1 or PGHS-2 (12Morita I.

Cells (PBMCs, NIH 3T3, and HUVEC) were obtained in a 2.5-ml suspension of an appropriate medium and immediately fixed by the addition of 2.5 ml of 2× fixative. Two different fixation methods were employed to allow for differences in the sensitivity to fixation of PGHS-1 and -2 antigens. Microwave/glutaraldehyde-fixed cells were fixed exactly as described previously (21Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Cells fixed with Nakane fixative (22McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem.

These cells were then washed twice with 1× Nakane fixative and resuspended in fresh 1× Nakane before an overnight (or shorter) incubation at 4 °C. NIH 3T3 cells immunolabeled for PGHS-2 were only fixed at 4 °C for an additional 2 h after the 2-h room temperature fixation. After the overnight fixation step, both microwave/glutaraldehyde- and Nakane-fixed cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.1 m sucrose/PBS, and pelleted in 2% low gelling temperature agarose, 0.1 msucrose, PBS. Cryoprotection was performed for 2 h (25 °C) or overnight (4 °C) in polyvinylpyrrolidone, 2.3 msucrose/phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) (polyvinylpyrrolidone-sucrose) (21Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D.

Cell pellets were mounted on bull's-eye specimen pins (Ted Pella, Inc.), frozen by plunging into liquid propane, and stored under liquid nitrogen until use. Immunogold labeling was performed essentially as described previously (21Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Briefly, ultrathin (75–80-nm) sections of cells were cut at −106 °C on a Reichert Ultracut S ultramicrotome fitted with a Reichert FCS cryoattachment. Sections were collected on drops of 2.3 m sucrose and placed on glow discharged, Formvar-coated nickel grids (Ted Pella, Inc.). After a minimum of 1 h in blocking solution (5% milk, 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS, 0.02% sodium azide) and washing, grids were placed section-side down on 25-μl drops of primary antibody solutions of various concentrations and incubated for various times depending on the primary antibody. All antibody solutions were cleaned by filtration through 0.2-μm filters prior to use. To control for antibody specificity, primary antibodies were incubated with a 50-fold molar excess of either cognate peptide (for anti-PGHS-1 or anti-PGHS-2 peptide directed antibodies) or an approximately 10-fold molar excess of purified ovine PGHS-1 or -2 (for antibodies prepared against either whole protein). Preadsorption of whole protein antibodies with purified PGHS-1 or -2 was performed with constant agitation at 4 °C for 24 h. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm in a Beckman Microfuge for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatants were removed, filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter, and used as primary antibody solutions in immunogold labeling experiments. Purified ovine PGHS-1 was from R. M. Garavito at Michigan State University; purified ovine PGHS-2 was from Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI. After incubation with primary antibody, each grid was washed eight times for 3 min on drops of 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS, 0.02% sodium azide before a 1-h incubation at room temperature on drops of gold-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech GAR-G5 diluted 1:75 in 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS, 0.02% sodium azide). After a washing step, sections were post-fixed and stained for contrast by floating the grids sequentially on drops of 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% osmium tetroxide, and 2% uranyl acetate. Polyvinyl alcohol (2%) was used to embed the grids before observation by transmission electron microscopy (23Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1989; 21: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). All primary antibodies were raised in rabbits as described previously (24Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For PGHS-2 staining of human monocytes and HUVECs, a polyclonal antibody raised against ovine PGHS-2 was used. This antibody (from Dr. Jilly Evans, Merck Frosst) cross-reacts with human PGHS-2 but not with ovine or human PGHS-1 (25Kargman S. Charleson S. Cartwright M. Frank J. Riendeau D. Mancini J. Evans J. O'Neill G. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). PGHS-1 immunostaining of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts was performed with an affinity purified anti-peptide antibody directed against amino acids Leu274-Arg288 of murine PGHS-1 (26Otto J.C. Smith W.L. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1995; 23: 29-34PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody does not cross-react with PGHS-2 in Western blotting experiments. Another antibody, an IgG fraction from a polyclonal antibody raised against PGHS-1 (27Smith W.L. Bell T.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: F451-F457PubMed Google Scholar), recognizes only PGHS-1 and was used for immunolabeling of NIH 3T3 cells and HUVECs. PGHS-2 labeling of NIH 3T3 cells was performed using an affinity purified anti-peptide antibody directed against an 18-amino acid cassette near the C terminus of PGHS-2 (12Morita I. Schindler M.

Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); this antibody does not cross-react with any known PGHS-1 but recognizes human and murine PGHS-2 on Western blots. We determined the distribution of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 between the inner and outer nuclear membranes essentially as described previously (21Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Gold particles lying on or within one 5-nm particle diameter of the inner nuclear membrane were designated as being on the inner nuclear membrane. Particles lying on or within one 5-nm particle diameter of the outer nuclear membrane were designated as being on the outer nuclear membrane. When a gold particle was observed in the nuclear envelope and not within one particle diameter of either membrane, it was designated as lumenal. Analysis of the distribution of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 was performed on a total of 24 and 32 cells, respectively. Distribution analysis was limited to well-preserved sections of nuclear envelope. Only regions of cells in which the inner and outer nuclear envelope were clearly distinguishable were used for our analyses. The distribution analysis described above was performed using at least three experimental groups of well preserved cells for both PGHS-1 in NIH 3T3 cells and PGHS-2 in monocytes. The analysis of PGHS-2 in NIH 3T3 cells was performed on seven cells taken from two separate experiments. Analysis of the mean distribution percentages using Student's t test showed that there was no significant difference between the inner membrane/outer membrane distribution of PGHS-1 and -2 in the cell types analyzed. It is possible for a protein of the nuclear envelope to be present in significantly different amounts on the inner and outer nuclear membranes, as evidenced by our previous work (21Woods J.W.

NIH 3T3 cells were prepared as whole cell lysates, microsomes, or isolated nuclei. For whole cells, harvests of three 100-mm culture dishes of serum-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells in PBS were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salts solution (HBSS). The resuspended cells were then disrupted by sonication and Dounce homogenization to produce whole cell lysates. Microsomes were prepared as described previously (29Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 1983; 3: 2203-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) began with the harvest of 20 dishes of 3T3 cells in PBS followed by centrifugation at 1000 ×g. Nuclei were isolated in the presence of 0.2 or 1% saponin as described below. Isolation of nuclei in the absence of detergent was begun by resuspending the nuclei in 10 ml of cold Buffer A (10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg leupeptin/ml, and 3 mm MgCl2(pH 8.0)) and incubation on ice for 5 min, followed by 5 s of gentle vortexing. After passage 10 times through a 20-gauge needle, the crude nuclei were again collected by centrifugation at 1000 ×g. The pellet was resuspended in 6 ml of cold Buffer A and incubated on ice for 5 min. After an additional 10 passages through a 20-gauge needle, the suspension was subjected to gentle homogenization in a Teflon homogenizer. Half of the suspension was placed in each of two Beckman 5-ml UltraClear ultracentrifuge tubes. A nuclear spin cushion was prepared by dissolving 6.16 g of sucrose in 10 ml of Buffer B (60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mmspermidine, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) to give a 1.8m sucrose solution. After underlaying 2 ml of the sucrose solution beneath the crude nuclear suspension, the tubes were centrifuged for 19 min at 4 °C at 13,500 rpm in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. Isolated nuclei were visible at the bottom of the tubes. The liquid was removed from the tubes by aspiration, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of HBSS. Nuclei were washed 4 times with HBSS and collected by centrifugation at 1800 rpm for 3 min in a microcentrifuge. Purified nuclei and whole cell lysates were disrupted by sonication before protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay solution. Aliquots of broken cells, microsomes, or nuclei (20 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (34Otto J.C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18234-18242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometric quantitation of immunoreactive PGHS-1 or -2 was performed using a Bio-Rad GS-505 Molecular Imaging System and Molecular Analyst software. For a given isozyme, densities are expressed as the ratio of nuclear to microsomal immunoreactivity. Student's t test was utilized to determine if these ratios for PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 were significantly different for each experimental condition. Murine NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum in a water-saturated 7% CO2 incubator. At approximately 60% confluence, the cells were starved for 48 h by incubation in DMEM containing 0.2% fetal calf serum. Quiescent cells were stimulated by the addition of fetal bovine serum (final concentration of 16%) for 3 h (20DeWitt D.L. Meade E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In some experiments various PGHS-1 and/or PGHS-2 inhibitors (valerylsalicylate (500 μm), NS398 (15 μm), flurbiprofen (100 μm), or aspirin (500 μm)) were added 30 min before the addition of serum (10Laneuville O.

Biophys. 1995; 317: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and when used, these agents were also present in the medium during the stimulation. NIH 3T3 cells, typically from 20 100-mm culture dishes, were scraped from the dishes with a rubber policeman and collected by centrifugation. To isolate nuclei, cell pellets were resuspended in 8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% (for product analysis and Western blotting) or 0.2% (for Western blotting only) saponin using a 20-gauge needle and were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The crude nuclear pellets were washed twice with 3 ml of SM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 250 μm ATP, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) and then were resuspended in 1.5 ml of SM buffer. The pellet suspensions were layered on top of 1 ml of SM buffer containing 2.1 m sucrose in a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The nuclear pellets were resuspended with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and sonicated three times for 5 s. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. The Western blotting for PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 was performed as described above. Radio-thin layer chromatographic analysis of prostanoid product formation was performed essentially as described by Takahashiet al. (36Takahashi Y. Reddy G.R. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. Arase S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16443-16448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using aliquots of the same samples used for Western transfer blotting. Each assay sample contained 35 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 μm hematin, 2 mm tryptophan, and 2 mm glutathione in a 200-μl reaction volume; assays were performed for 10 min at 37 °C. PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 inhibitors (valerylsalicylate (500 μm), NS398 (15 μm), flurbiprofen (100 μm), or aspirin (500 μm)) were included as indicated in the figure legends. Thin layer chromatography plates were developed with the organic phase of ethyl acetate/acetic acid/2,2,4-trimethylpentane/water (110:20:50:100, v/v) for 1 h, exposed to x-ray film (Kodak, Bio-MAX), and the products determined by comparison with chromatographic standards. The amounts of PGE2 and PGF2 were quantified by scintillation counting. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy human volunteers, treated for 20 h with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and processed for electron microscopy. Western blotting of samples of these cells prior to fixation established that, as expected, PGHS-2 expression was induced by LPS but that vehicle-treated cells lacked detectable levels of this isozyme (37Hempel S.L.

https://openalex.org/W1993764616,"We showed previously that stable, detyrosinated (Glu) microtubules function to localize vimentin intermediate filaments in fibroblasts (Gurland, G., and Gundersen, G. G. (1995)J. Cell Biol. 131, 1275–1290). To identify candidate proteins that mediate the Glu microtubule-vimentin interaction, we incubated microtubules with microtubule-interacting proteins and saturating levels of antibodies to Glu or tyrosinated (Tyr) tubulin. Antibodies to Glu tubulin prevented the microtubule binding of kinesin obtained from fibroblast or brain extracts more effectively than antibodies to Tyr tubulin. Scatchard plot analysis showed that kinesin heads bound to Glu microtubules with an ∼2.8-fold higher affinity than to Tyr microtubules. Purified brain kinesin cosedimented with vimentin, but not with neurofilaments, indicating that kinesin specifically associates with vimentin without accessory molecules. Kinesin binding to vimentin was not sensitive to ATP, and kinesin heads failed to bind to vimentin. By SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a kinesin heavy chain of ∼120 kDa and a light chain of ∼64 kDa were detected in vimentin/kinesin pellets. The light chain reacted with a general kinesin light chain antibody, but not with two other antibodies that recognize the two known isoforms of kinesin light chain in brain, suggesting that the kinesin involved in binding to vimentin may be a specific one. These results demonstrate a kinesin-based mechanism for the preferential interaction of vimentin with detyrosinated microtubules. We showed previously that stable, detyrosinated (Glu) microtubules function to localize vimentin intermediate filaments in fibroblasts (Gurland, G., and Gundersen, G. G. (1995)J.

These results demonstrate a kinesin-based mechanism for the preferential interaction of vimentin with detyrosinated microtubules. Microtubules (MTs) 1The abbreviations used are: MTs, microtubules; Glu MTs, detyrosinated microtubules; Tyr MTs, tyrosinated microtubules; IF, intermediate filament; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MAP, microtubule-associated protein. are highly dynamic structures that are present in nearly every eukaryotic cell. During cellular polarization and differentiation, MTs become stabilized, and the tubulin subunits composing these MTs become post-translationally modified. One of these modifications is detyrosination, which involves the removal of the C-terminal tyrosine residue from α-tubulin (2Argarana C.E. Barra H.S. Caputto R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1978; 19: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This generates α-tubulin with a glutamate residue at the C terminus. The two forms of α-tubulin are called Tyr and Glu tubulin after their respective C termini (3Gundersen G.G. Kalnoski M.H. Bulinski J.C. Cell. 1984; 38: 779-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Even though tubulin detyrosination accompanies the stabilization of MTs (4Schulze E. Asai D.J. Bulinski J.C.

Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), several studies have demonstrated that the elevated Glu tubulin level is not responsible for the increased stability of Glu MTs (5Khawaja S. Gundersen G.G. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 6Webster D.R. Gundersen G.G. Bulinski J.C. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nonetheless, tubulin detyrosination can serve as a marker for stable MTs in vivo. The role of enhanced tubulin modification in MT function had remained elusive until recently, when studies from this laboratory showed that stable Glu MTs function to localize vimentin intermediate filaments (IFs) in polarized fibroblasts (1Gurland G. Gundersen G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1275-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this study, IFs were found to coalign with Glu MTs, and this coalignment could be disrupted by microinjection of affinity-purified antibodies to Glu tubulin, but not to Tyr tubulin. In a more recent study, microinjection of nonpolymerizable Glu tubulin, but not Tyr tubulin, into the cytoplasm disrupted the distribution of IFs without affecting the level of stable MTs. 2G. Kreitzer and G. G. Gundersen, submitted for publication. These results conclusively demonstrate that tubulin detyrosination, rather than increased MT stability, is responsible for the Glu MT-IF interaction. We hypothesize that Glu tubulin may function as a signal for the recruitment of IFs, and perhaps other cellular components, onto stable MTs in polarized cells.2 One critical element to understand the preferential interaction of IFs with Glu MTs is to determine the factors involved in mediating the interaction. Previous studies have provided evidence for cross-bridging structures or molecules that might mediate the interaction between IFs and MTs (11Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 12Svitkina T.M. Verkhovsky A.B. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 991-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar); however, none of these candidates has been shown to interact selectively with Glu versus Tyr tubulin. In this study, we have pursued the identity of factors that might be mediating the preferential interaction between IFs and Glu MTs by using antibodies to Glu tubulin as competitors for the binding of the putative cross-bridging molecule to Glu MTs in vitro. We found that antibodies to Glu tubulin reduced the binding of a kinesin to MTs more effectively than antibodies to Tyr tubulin. By directly measuring the binding affinity of kinesin for pure Glu and Tyr MTs, we confirm that kinesin binds to Glu MTs with a 2.8-fold higher affinity than to Tyr MTs. In further experiments, we found that there is a kinesin that specifically cosediments with vimentin IFs, but not with neurofilaments or actin filaments. This kinesin is composed of kinesin heavy chain and a light chain that might be novel. Taken together, our results show that kinesin can mediate the preferential interaction of vimentin IFs with Glu MTs. Taxol was a gift of Dr. Ven L. Narayanan (NCI, Bethesda, MD).

Crude preparations of MT motor proteins were obtained from 3T3 cell extracts and brain extracts according to Rickard and Kreis (19Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 3T3 cells were grown on 20 dishes (150 mm) to confluency and detached from the dishes by incubation in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mmNaCl, and 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed in the same buffer, and lysed by sonication in 5 ml of PEMG (100 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm GTP). The brain extracts were obtained by homogenizing the gray matter of calf brains in 1.3 volumes of PEMG in a blender. Cell lysate and brain homogenate were depleted of cell or tissue debris (40,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the high-speed supernatant. The endogenous tubulin in the high-speed brain supernatant was polymerized by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min and then sedimented (40,000 × g, 30 min, 37 °C). The supernatant (H1S) was then concentrated in dialysis tubing against Aquacide (Calbiochem). Concentrated H1S and the high-speed supernatant of the 3T3 cell extract were then incubated with 10 units/ml hexokinase, 10 mmglucose, 50 μm AMP-PNP, 20 μm Taxol, and DEAE-purified bovine brain tubulin (9Gundersen G.G.

MTs and associated proteins were then sedimented and washed as described (19Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted from MTs with PEM (PEMG without GTP), pH 6.9, containing 10 mm Mg2+ATP. Isolation of kinesin at >95% purity from bovine brain was as described (20Wagner M.C. Pfister K.K. Brady S.T. Bloom G.S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 157-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), except that concentrated H1S (see above) was used as the starting material in our preparation. Tubulin from calf brain and HeLa cell extracts was purified by two cycles of assembly-disassembly followed by DEAE-Sephadex A-50 chromatography (9Gundersen G.G. Khawaja S. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 21Chapin S.J. Bulinski J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Pure Glu tubulin was prepared by incubation of calf or HeLa tubulin with pancreatic carboxypeptidase A as described (9Gundersen G.G. Khawaja S. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of K394 in 25 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 150 mm KCl was added to the same amounts of Glu or Tyr MTs (0.8 μmfinal concentration) assembled from pure HeLa cell Glu or Tyr tubulin in the presence of 20 μm Taxol. The final concentration of K394 in the incubation mixtures was between 0.16 and 0.48 μm. MTs and MT-bound K394 were separated from soluble proteins by sedimentation (100,000 × g, 7 min, 4 °C), and the levels of K394 in the MT pellets were measured by quantitative Western blotting. Glu and Tyr tubulin assembled into MTs with a similar efficiency as detected by Ponceau staining of the nitrocellulose membrane before proceeding for Western blotting (data not shown). A full-length vimentin clone (pET3a-V62-1) was used to transform Escherichia coli(DE3), and vimentin expression was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (1 mm for 4 h). Cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A (6 murea, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 μg/ml each chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin). After clarifying the lysate by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 10 min), vimentin IFs were induced to assemble by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, with 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol overnight at 4 °C and then collected by centrifugation (60,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). The vimentin pellet was dissolved in buffer A, and IFs were reassembled as described above. Assembled vimentin was collected and disassembled again as described above, and the vimentin solution was passed though a DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.5 mNaCl in buffer A. Vimentin was recovered at a single peak at 0.4–0.45m NaCl and was shown to be >90% pure by SDS-PAGE. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). Antibodies used to probe Western blots included anti-kinesin heavy chain antibodies H2 (13Pfister K.K. Wagner M.C. Stenoien D.L. Brady S.T. Bloom G.S. J.

Cell. 1997; 8: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); anti-β-tubulin mAb 3F3 (25Moyer S.A. Baker S.C. Lessard J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5405-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); and anti-Glu and anti-Tyr tubulin polyclonal antibodies SG and W2, respectively (3Gundersen G.G. Kalnoski M.H. Bulinski J.C. Cell. 1984; 38: 779-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. Blots were developed with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. The protein concentrations of samples were determined with the BCA assay using bovine serum albumin as standard (Pierce) or the Bradford assay (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) using bovine γ-globulins as standard. In a search for the cross-bridging molecule that mediates the Glu MT-IF interaction, we assembled Taxol-stabilized MTs from purified calf brain tubulin (an ∼50:50 mixture of Glu and Tyr tubulin (9Gundersen G.G. Khawaja S. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar)) and incubated them with saturating levels of affinity-purified antibodies to either Glu (SG) or Tyr (W2) tubulin and subsaturating levels of preparations of MT-interacting proteins. If there is a Glu tubulin-specific cross-bridging molecule, antibodies to Glu tubulin, but not to Tyr tubulin, should sterically interfere with the binding of the cross-bridging molecule to MTs. When we incubated MTs with SG or W2 and crude preparations of brain MT-associated proteins (MAPs), we did not see significant inhibition of individual MAP binding with either antibody (data not shown). These results are consistent with previous observations (10Kumar N. Flavin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,21Chapin S.J. Bulinski J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Wehland J. Willingham M.C. Sandoval I.V. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). With preparations of MT motor proteins from a 3T3 cell extract, SG (but not W2) blocked the sedimentation of an ∼110-kDa polypeptide with MTs (Fig. 1 a). At a 1:1 molar ratio of antibody to tubulin, SG significantly reduced the binding of the 110-kDa protein to MTs, whereas the level of the 110-kDa protein in the W2-treated sample was comparable to that in the control sample, where no antibody was added. At a 4:1 ratio of antibody to tubulin, the binding of both SG and W2 to MTs was saturated (data not shown), and the 110-kDa protein was not detectable in the SG-treated sample, but was still present in the W2-treated sample (Fig. 1 a). Other polypeptide bands were not significantly affected by either antibody (e.g. bands at ∼70 and ∼80 kDa). The 110-kDa protein ran as a doublet in some of the samples (see control (C) lane in Fig. 1 a). A mAb to Glu tubulin, 4B8 (1Gurland G. Gundersen G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1275-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (from J. C. Bulinski, Columbia University), also inhibited the binding of the 110-kDa protein to MTs more effectively than a mAb to Tyr tubulin, YL1/2 (27Kilmartin J.V. Wright B. Milstein C. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We identified the 110-kDa polypeptide as a member of the kinesin family based on a number of criteria. The 110-kDa polypeptide bound to MTs in the absence of ATP and was eluted from MTs with 10 mm ATP (data not shown), consistent with characteristics of kinesin motor proteins (28Vale R.D. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1985; 42: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). Moreover, a mAb to kinesin heavy chain, H2, recognized the 110-kDa protein in the MT motor protein pellet (Fig. 1 b). Another mAb to kinesin (SUK4) and a polyclonal antibody to kinesin (HD) also reacted with the 110-kDa protein (data not shown). Experiments with preparations of MT motor proteins from brain extracts showed similar results, except that the polypeptide that was inhibited from binding to MTs by SG migrated at ∼120 kDa (see below, Fig. 1 c). These results demonstrate that Glu antibody is capable of inhibiting the binding of two different kinesins to MTs. We next analyzed the level of kinesin binding to MTs in the presence of SG or W2 using Western blotting with H2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 c, SG prevented more kinesin from binding to MTs than W2. We also analyzed the MT pellets to determine the level of tubulin antibody bound to MTs. No significant difference was observed in the levels of IgG that cosedimented with MTs (Fig. 1 d). These results rule out the possibility that the differential capability of SG and W2 to inhibit the binding of kinesin to MTs was due to differential binding of SG and W2 to MTs. To quantify the capability of SG and W2 antibodies to inhibit the binding of kinesin to MTs, we determined the percentage of inhibition of kinesin binding by SG or W2 antibodies and normalized this by the amount of SG or W2 bound to the MTs. Levels of kinesin and SG or W2 antibody bound to MTs were measured by quantitative Western blotting with H2 antibody and a commercial antibody to rabbit IgG, respectively. Table I shows the individual determinations from three identical experiments (only two determinations of the amount of bound antibody were made). On average, SG inhibited the binding of kinesin to MTs by ∼64%, whereas W2 inhibited binding only by 36%. When these levels are normalized against the amount of antibody bound to MTs, we found that at equivalent levels of antibody bound to MTs, SG inhibited the binding of kinesin to MTs 1.7-fold more than W2 did (Table I). Since we used low, subsaturating levels of kinesin in these experiments, these data suggest that kinesin was preferentially bound to Glu rather than Tyr tubulin, so that when Glu tubulin sites were blocked, more kinesin was displaced.Table IQuantification of inhibition of kinesin binding to microtubules by antibodies to Glu and Tyr tubulinKinesin bindingSGW2% of controlExp. 14475Exp. 23355Exp. 33062Average36 ± 674 ± 8Amount of MT-bound antibodiesSGW2μgExp. 14.64.4Exp. 24.03.8Average4.34.1 Open table in a new tab To directly compare the binding affinity of kinesin for Glu and Tyr MTs, we prepared tubulin from HeLa cells to generate MTs composed of pure Glu and Tyr tubulin. Tubulin purified from HeLa cells is reported to be >90% Tyr tubulin (21Chapin S.J. Bulinski J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and can be converted to Glu tubulin by carboxypeptidase A treatment (9Gundersen G.G. Khawaja S. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Moreover, tubulin prepared from HeLa cells is not as complex as brain tubulin since it does not contain several post-translational modifications abundant in brain tubulin (e.g. polyglutamylation (29Edde B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.-P. Desbruyeres E. Gros F. Denoulet P. Science. 1990; 247: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and nontyrosinatable tubulin (30Paturle-Lafanechere L. Edde B. Denoulet P. Van Dorsselaer A. Mazarguil H. Le Caer J.-P. Wehland J. Job D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10523-10528Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar)). We have confirmed that our preparations of HeLa cell tubulin and carboxypeptidase A-treated HeLa cell tubulin were predominantly Tyr (90%) and Glu (100%) tubulin, respectively. To measure the binding affinity of kinesin for Glu and Tyr MTs, we used a recombinant head domain of squid kinesin heavy chain, K394 (16Song Y.H. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1671-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We incubated increasing amounts of K394 with Taxol-stabilized Glu or Tyr MTs and separated the bound kinesin from unbound by sedimenting the MTs. The amount of kinesin bound was analyzed by quantitative Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2 a, more K394 bound to Glu MTs than to Tyr MTs at all concentrations. Scatchard plot analysis of binding assays showed that K394 bound to Glu and Tyr MTs with Kd values of 29 and 81 nm, respectively (Fig. 2 b). These results directly demonstrate that kinesin preferentially binds to Glu MTs compared with Tyr MTs. We showed above that antibodies to Glu tubulin reduced the binding of a 110-kDa (3T3 cell) and a 120-kDa (brain) kinesin to MTs more effectively than antibodies to Tyr tubulin and that recombinant kinesin heads bound to Glu MTs with a higher affinity than to Tyr MTs. These results strongly suggest that a kinesin may mediate the preferential interaction of vimentin IFs with Glu MTs. To test this possibility directly, we assembled vimentin IFs from purified recombinant vimentin and tested whether a kinesin could associate with vimentin IFs. We found a 120-kDa kinesin in the MT motor protein preparation from bovine brain cosedimented with purified vimentin IFs, as assessed by both protein staining and Western blotting (Fig. 3 a, lanes 1and 4). Experiments with preparations of MT motor proteins from 3T3 cell extracts showed a 110-kDa kinesin cosedimenting with vimentin (data not shown). The kinesin in the preparation did not sediment alone (Fig. 3 a, lanes 3 and 6). The sedimentation of this kinesin with vimentin IFs was not due to trapping by filamentous proteins since significantly less kinesin was found in the pellet from an equivalent amount of actin filaments (Fig. 3 b, compare lanes 2 and 4 with lanes 1 and 3). To distinguish whether the 120-kDa kinesin from preparations of brain MT motor proteins associated with vimentin IFs directly or through some accessory molecules, we purified kinesin from brain (see “Experimental Procedures”). Analysis of the preparation through the sequential steps of the purification (MT motor proteins (lane M), gel filtration (lane G), ion exchange (lane I), and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation (lane S)) showed the enrichment of the kinesin heavy (120 kDa) and light (64 kDa) chains (Fig. 4 a). For unknown reasons, our purified kinesin preparation contained relatively more light chain than that detected in kinesin preparations obtained by other laboratories (20Wagner M.C. Pfister K.K. Brady S.T. Bloom G.S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 157-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After the final sucrose gradient density centrifugation step, the preparation contained only the 120-kDa heavy and 64-kDa light chains (Fig. 4 a, lane S). As shown in Fig. 4 b, with the 120-kDa kinesin obtained from different stages of purification, comparable levels of kinesin (even with the purest fraction) sedimented with vimentin IFs, indicating that the 120-kDa kinesin associated with vimentin without the need for an accessory protein (however, see below for an analysis of light chain binding). More important, the 120-kDa kinesin from the purest fraction did not cosediment significantly with a comparable amount of neurofilament proteins (Fig. 4 c), showing that the interaction of kinesin is specific for vimentin IFs. Conventional kinesin holoenzyme is a tetramer composed of two ∼120-kDa heavy chains and two 60–70-kDa light chains (31Bloom G.S. Wagner M.C. Pfister K.K. Bradt S.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3409-3416Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The head domain of kinesin heavy chain is conserved among different isoforms of kinesin and kinesin-like proteins and contains both MT- and ATP-binding sites (for review, see Ref. 32Goldstein L.S.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 319-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We determined if kinesin head was involved in the association of kinesin with vimentin by testing whether recombinant squid kinesin head, K394, cosedimented with vimentin. As shown in Fig. 5 a, no K394 was found in the pellet after centrifugation of a vimentin/K394 incubation mixture, showing that the vimentin-binding site of kinesin is not located in the head domain. While the binding of kinesin to MTs is normally inhibited by millimolar levels of ATP, cosedimentation of the 120-kDa kinesin with vimentin IFs was not affected by the presence of 2 mm ATP (Fig. 6 b). These results show that the binding of kinesin to vimentin occurs by a mechanism distinct from that involved in kinesin-MT binding.Figure 6Cosedimentation of kinesin light chains with vimentin IFs. a, vimentin IFs were incubated with sucrose density gradient-purified kinesin, pelleted by centrifugation, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.

We sought to identify the tissue plasminogen activator binding domain of annexin II and to determine the mechanism of its modulation by homocysteine. Tissue plasminogen activator binding to immobilized annexin II was inhibited by intact fluid phase annexin II but not by its “core” fragment (residues 25–339). Two overlapping “tail” peptides specifically blocked 65–75% of binding. Localization of the tissue plasminogen activator binding domain was confirmed upon specific inhibition by the hexapeptide LCKLSL (residues 7–12). Expressed C9G annexin II protein failed to support tissue plasminogen activator binding, while binding to C133G, C262G, and C335G was equivalent to that of wild type annexin II. Upon exposure to homocysteine, annexin II underwent a 135 ± 4-Da increase in mass localizing specifically to Cys9 and a 60–66% loss in tissue plasminogen activator-binding capacity (I50 = 11 μm). Upon treatment of cultured endothelial cells with [35S]homocysteine, the dithiothreitol-sensitive label was recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-annexin II IgG. These data provide a potential mechanism for the prothrombotic effect of homocysteine by demonstrating direct blockade of the tissue plasminogen activator binding domain of annexin II.

Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1995; 2: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Both PLG and t-PA bind to the surface of endothelial cells, a process that is mediated by the calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein annexin II (Ann-II) (2Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly of a functional PLG-t-PA·Ann-II complex, which is associated with a 60-fold increase in catalytic efficiency of plasmin generation (3Hajjar K.A. Harpel P.C. Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11656-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), appears to require at least three independent binding domains of Ann-II. First, interaction of Ann-II with endothelial cell membrane phospholipid is mediated by the calcium-regulated juxtaposition of Lys130–Thr134 with Asp161 within endonexin repeat II (5Hajjar K.A. Guevara C.A. Lev E. Dowling K. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21652-21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Second, PLG binding requires the carboxyl-terminal Lys307 of processed Ann-II, which interacts specifically with “kringle”-associated lysine binding sites of PLG (2Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, an independent domain of Ann-II binds t-PA, increasing its affinity for PLG and subsequent generation of plasmin (3Hajjar K.A. Harpel P.C. Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11656-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Cell surface plasmin generation is thought to contribute to the thromboresistance of endothelial cells (6Hajjar K.A. Menell J.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 811: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The specific interaction of t-PA with endothelial cells is inhibited by the thiol-containing amino acid, homocysteine (HC) (7Hajjar K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), which is formed upon demethylation of dietary methionine. HC accumulates in several inborn errors of metabolism and in some nutritional deficiencies, and homocysteinemia has been identified as an independent risk factor for atherothrombotic vascular disease (8McCully K.S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 9Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 10D'Angelo A. Selhub J. Blood. 1997; 90: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we postulated that HC selectively impairs the t-PA binding domain of Ann-II, thereby inhibiting vessel wall thromboresistance and predisposing to blood vessel occlusion (7Hajjar K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We sought to identify the t-PA binding domain of annexin II and to determine the molecular mechanism by which HC impairs its interaction with t-PA.DISCUSSIONThe present data identify a linear sequence of amino acids required for binding of t-PA to Ann-II, its major endothelial cell receptor. The t-PA binding domain of Ann-II was localized to the 23-amino acid amino-terminal tail region of the molecule and more specifically to the hexapeptide sequence LCKLSL, residues 8–13. Although the carboxyl-terminal core portions of the annexin family of proteins share roughly 40–50% homology at the amino acid level (19Smith P.D. Moss S.E. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the tail domains show limited homology and are thought to confer functional diversity (20Moss S.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 87-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Indeed, our previous studies suggest that, of annexins I, II, IV, and VI, only Ann-II possesses t-PA binding capacity. 2K. A. Hajjar, unpublished observations. The present data, in addition, provide further evidence that the t-PA binding domain of Ann-II is independent of its PLG binding site, the latter having been localized to the extreme carboxyl terminus of the processed protein (2Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Hajjar K.A. Gavish D. Breslow J. Nachman R.L. Nature. 1989; 339: 303-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar).The tail domain of Ann-II has previously been implicated in binding of the Ann-II light chain (p11) to form the Ann-II heterotetramer, a complex thought to be involved in intracellular membrane-bridging events (21Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 301-322Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p11 is known to bind within the first 9 residues of the Ann-II tail (STVHEILCK), and Cys9 has been localized within the Ann-II-p11 interface by fluorescence quenching studies (22Johnsson N. Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of p11 includes the sequence CRDGK (residues 61–65) (23Harder T. Kube E. Gerke V. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which closely mimics a portion of the “finger” domain of t-PA (CRDEK, residues 6–17 (RDEKTQMIYQQ)) (24Gerke V. Weber K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2917-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), previously reported to mediate binding of t-PA to HUVEC (25Beebe D.B. Miles L.A. Plow E.F. Blood. 1989; 74: 2034-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that t-PA and the light chain of Ann-II, p11, bind to closely related regions of Ann-II and interact with Ann-II in a mutually exclusive or co-competitive fashion.Peptides mimicking this region of Ann-II effectively blocked binding of t-PA to the purified recombinant protein. There is, further, ample precedent for the observation that this effect was observed at relatively high peptide concentrations (I50 = 200–1000 nm) compared with the apparent Kd for the intact protein (Kd = 10–20 nm) (5Hajjar K.A.

Blood. 1989; 74: 2034-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Potential explanations include the possibility that a 6–12-residue peptide might not assume a conformation identical to that of the parent protein or that additional vicinal residues might contribute to full binding capacity. In addition, peptides might interact nonspecifically with other cell-associated proteins or tissue culture surfaces. However, in the context of mutational experiments showing the requirement for Cys9 for t-PA binding to Ann-II and the direct blockade of this residue by homocysteine, it seems reasonable to conclude that the LCKLSL region of the Ann-II tail plays a role in t-PA binding.Our data indicate that the thiol-containing amino acid, HC, can inhibit t-PA binding to annexin II by directly complexing with Cys9within its putative hexapeptide binding domain (LCKLSL). This interaction with HC appears to be disulfide-mediated and unique among the four cysteine residues of Ann-II. Although blockade of Cys9 of Ann-II impairs its ability to bind t-PA, there is no evidence for a disulfide linkage between t-PA and annexin II within the time frame of this experiment (26Hajjar K.A. Hamel N.M. Harpel P.C. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This is perhaps a reflection of the fact that the single unpaired cysteine of t-PA (Cys83) is located not within the “finger”-based Ann-II binding module (residues 6–17) but rather some distance away within the epidermal growth factor domain (27Sehl L.C. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Arcila P. Bennett W.F. Keyt B.A. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Elevated plasma HC has been identified as an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease and is further associated with deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism (8McCully K.S.

Res. 1993; 71: 337-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Because it is not a dietary constituent, the sole source of HC in human tissues is methionine. Classical homocystinuria results from deficiency of the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (vitamin B6)-dependent enzyme, cystathionine β-synthase, which condenses homocyst(e)ine with serine to form cystathionine, a precursor of cysteine (30Mudd S.H. Skovby F. Levy H.L. Pettigrew K.D. Wilcken B. Pyeritz R.E. Andrea G. Boers G.H.J. Bromberg I.L. Cerone R. Fowler B. Grobe H. Schmidt H. Schweitzer L. Am. J. Hum.

However, genetic deficiencies of the enzymes 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, which participate in the remethylation of HC and regeneration of methionine, are also causes of homocyst(e)inemia (32Frosst P.

Normal adult males and females have HC levels of 6–10 and 8–12 μm, respectively (8McCully K.S. Nat.

Motulsky A.G. JAMA (J. Am. Med. Assoc.). 1995; 274: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (3503) Google Scholar). Untreated patients with homocystinuria may have plasma levels as high as 400 μm (10D'Angelo A. Selhub J. Blood. 1997; 90: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One recent study found a strong, graded association between plasma HC levels from 9 to 20 μm and overall mortality in patients with angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease (44Nygard O. Nordrehaug J.E. Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Farstad M. Vollset S.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Similarly, the risk of extracranial carotid artery stenosis for elderly men and women was 2-fold higher for individuals with plasma HC levels exceeding 14.4 μm compared with those with levels less than 9.1 μm (45Selhub J. Jacques P.F. Bostom A.G. D'Agostino R.B. Wilson P.W.F. Belanger A.J. O'Leary D.H. Wolf P.A. Schaefer E.J. Rosenberg I.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that HC at levels of ∼ 11 μm can inhibit ∼50% of t-PA binding to Ann-II and that higher levels can block as much as 66%. This loss of fibrinolytic potential could play an etiologic role in life-threatening vascular disorders. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), 1The abbreviations used are: t-PA, tissue plasminogen activator; Ann-II, annexin II; ESI, electrospray ionization, nAnn-II, native annexin II; PLG, plasminogen; rAnn-II recombinant annexin II; HC, homocysteine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s). 1The abbreviations used are: t-PA, tissue plasminogen activator; Ann-II, annexin II; ESI, electrospray ionization, nAnn-II, native annexin II; PLG, plasminogen; rAnn-II recombinant annexin II; HC, homocysteine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s). aMr 68,000 glycoprotein synthesized and secreted by endothelial cells, activates plasminogen (PLG) to form the principal fibrinolytic protease, plasmin (1Hajjar K.A. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1995; 2: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Both PLG and t-PA bind to the surface of endothelial cells, a process that is mediated by the calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein annexin II (Ann-II) (2Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly of a functional PLG-t-PA·Ann-II complex, which is associated with a 60-fold increase in catalytic efficiency of plasmin generation (3Hajjar K.A. Harpel P.C. Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11656-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), appears to require at least three independent binding domains of Ann-II. First, interaction of Ann-II with endothelial cell membrane phospholipid is mediated by the calcium-regulated juxtaposition of Lys130–Thr134 with Asp161 within endonexin repeat II (5Hajjar K.A. Guevara C.A. Lev E. Dowling K. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21652-21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Second, PLG binding requires the carboxyl-terminal Lys307 of processed Ann-II, which interacts specifically with “kringle”-associated lysine binding sites of PLG (2Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, an independent domain of Ann-II binds t-PA, increasing its affinity for PLG and subsequent generation of plasmin (3Hajjar K.A. Harpel P.C. Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11656-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface plasmin generation is thought to contribute to the thromboresistance of endothelial cells (6Hajjar K.A. Menell J.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 811: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The specific interaction of t-PA with endothelial cells is inhibited by the thiol-containing amino acid, homocysteine (HC) (7Hajjar K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), which is formed upon demethylation of dietary methionine. HC accumulates in several inborn errors of metabolism and in some nutritional deficiencies, and homocysteinemia has been identified as an independent risk factor for atherothrombotic vascular disease (8McCully K.S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 9Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 10D'Angelo A. Selhub J. Blood. 1997; 90: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we postulated that HC selectively impairs the t-PA binding domain of Ann-II, thereby inhibiting vessel wall thromboresistance and predisposing to blood vessel occlusion (7Hajjar K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We sought to identify the t-PA binding domain of annexin II and to determine the molecular mechanism by which HC impairs its interaction with t-PA. DISCUSSIONThe present data identify a linear sequence of amino acids required for binding of t-PA to Ann-II, its major endothelial cell receptor. The t-PA binding domain of Ann-II was localized to the 23-amino acid amino-terminal tail region of the molecule and more specifically to the hexapeptide sequence LCKLSL, residues 8–13. Although the carboxyl-terminal core portions of the annexin family of proteins share roughly 40–50% homology at the amino acid level (19Smith P.D. Moss S.E. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the tail domains show limited homology and are thought to confer functional diversity (20Moss S.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 87-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Indeed, our previous studies suggest that, of annexins I, II, IV, and VI, only Ann-II possesses t-PA binding capacity. 2K. A. Hajjar, unpublished observations. The present data, in addition, provide further evidence that the t-PA binding domain of Ann-II is independent of its PLG binding site, the latter having been localized to the extreme carboxyl terminus of the processed protein (2Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Hajjar K.A. Gavish D. Breslow J. Nachman R.L. Nature. 1989; 339: 303-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar).The tail domain of Ann-II has previously been implicated in binding of the Ann-II light chain (p11) to form the Ann-II heterotetramer, a complex thought to be involved in intracellular membrane-bridging events (21Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 301-322Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p11 is known to bind within the first 9 residues of the Ann-II tail (STVHEILCK), and Cys9 has been localized within the Ann-II-p11 interface by fluorescence quenching studies (22Johnsson N. Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of p11 includes the sequence CRDGK (residues 61–65) (23Harder T. Kube E. Gerke V. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which closely mimics a portion of the “finger” domain of t-PA (CRDEK, residues 6–17 (RDEKTQMIYQQ)) (24Gerke V. Weber K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2917-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), previously reported to mediate binding of t-PA to HUVEC (25Beebe D.B. Miles L.A. Plow E.F.

Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of p11 includes the sequence CRDGK (residues 61–65) (23Harder T. Kube E. Gerke V. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which closely mimics a portion of the “finger” domain of t-PA (CRDEK, residues 6–17 (RDEKTQMIYQQ)) (24Gerke V. Weber K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2917-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), previously reported to mediate binding of t-PA to HUVEC (25Beebe D.B. Miles L.A. Plow E.F. Blood. 1989; 74: 2034-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that t-PA and the light chain of Ann-II, p11, bind to closely related regions of Ann-II and interact with Ann-II in a mutually exclusive or co-competitive fashion. Peptides mimicking this region of Ann-II effectively blocked binding of t-PA to the purified recombinant protein. There is, further, ample precedent for the observation that this effect was observed at relatively high peptide concentrations (I50 = 200–1000 nm) compared with the apparent Kd for the intact protein (Kd = 10–20 nm) (5Hajjar K.A. Guevara C.A. Lev E. Dowling K. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21652-21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,25Beebe D.B. Miles L.A. Plow E.F. Blood. 1989; 74: 2034-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Potential explanations include the possibility that a 6–12-residue peptide might not assume a conformation identical to that of the parent protein or that additional vicinal residues might contribute to full binding capacity. In addition, peptides might interact nonspecifically with other cell-associated proteins or tissue culture surfaces. However, in the context of mutational experiments showing the requirement for Cys9 for t-PA binding to Ann-II and the direct blockade of this residue by homocysteine, it seems reasonable to conclude that the LCKLSL region of the Ann-II tail plays a role in t-PA binding. Our data indicate that the thiol-containing amino acid, HC, can inhibit t-PA binding to annexin II by directly complexing with Cys9within its putative hexapeptide binding domain (LCKLSL). This interaction with HC appears to be disulfide-mediated and unique among the four cysteine residues of Ann-II. Although blockade of Cys9 of Ann-II impairs its ability to bind t-PA, there is no evidence for a disulfide linkage between t-PA and annexin II within the time frame of this experiment (26Hajjar K.A. Hamel N.M. Harpel P.C. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This is perhaps a reflection of the fact that the single unpaired cysteine of t-PA (Cys83) is located not within the “finger”-based Ann-II binding module (residues 6–17) but rather some distance away within the epidermal growth factor domain (27Sehl L.C. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Arcila P. Bennett W.F. Keyt B.A. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Elevated plasma HC has been identified as an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease and is further associated with deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism (8McCully K.S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 9Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 28Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Skovby F.

Res. 1993; 71: 337-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Because it is not a dietary constituent, the sole source of HC in human tissues is methionine. Classical homocystinuria results from deficiency of the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (vitamin B6)-dependent enzyme, cystathionine β-synthase, which condenses homocyst(e)ine with serine to form cystathionine, a precursor of cysteine (30Mudd S.H. Skovby F. Levy H.L. Pettigrew K.D. Wilcken B. Pyeritz R.E. Andrea G. Boers G.H.J. Bromberg I.L. Cerone R. Fowler B. Grobe H. Schmidt H. Schweitzer L. Am. J. Hum.

However, genetic deficiencies of the enzymes 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, which participate in the remethylation of HC and regeneration of methionine, are also causes of homocyst(e)inemia (32Frosst P.

Normal adult males and females have HC levels of 6–10 and 8–12 μm, respectively (8McCully K.S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), and levels exceeding 14 μm are associated with increased risk in nearly all studies (43Boushey C.J. Beresford S.A.A. Omenn G.S. Motulsky A.G. JAMA (J. Am. Med. Assoc.). 1995; 274: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (3503) Google Scholar). Untreated patients with homocystinuria may have plasma levels as high as 400 μm (10D'Angelo A. Selhub J. Blood. 1997; 90: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One recent study found a strong, graded association between plasma HC levels from 9 to 20 μm and overall mortality in patients with angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease (44Nygard O. Nordrehaug J.E. Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Farstad M. Vollset S.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Similarly, the risk of extracranial carotid artery stenosis for elderly men and women was 2-fold higher for individuals with plasma HC levels exceeding 14.4 μm compared with those with levels less than 9.1 μm (45Selhub J. Jacques P.F. Bostom A.G. D'Agostino R.B. Wilson P.W.F. Belanger A.J. O'Leary D.H. Wolf P.A. Schaefer E.J. Rosenberg I.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that HC at levels of ∼ 11 μm can inhibit ∼50% of t-PA binding to Ann-II and that higher levels can block as much as 66%. This loss of fibrinolytic potential could play an etiologic role in life-threatening vascular disorders. We appreciate the excellent technical assistance of Carlos Guevara and Emil Lev."
https://openalex.org/W2045340640,"The RNA-binding protein Tra2 is an important regulator of sex determination in Drosophila. Recently, two mammalian Tra2 homologs of unknown function have been described. Here, we show that human Tra2 proteins are present in HeLa cell nuclear extracts and that they bind efficiently and specifically to a previously characterized pre-mRNA splicing enhancer element. Indeed, both purified proteins bound preferentially to RNA sequences containing GAA repeats, characteristic of many enhancer elements. Neither Tra2 protein functioned in constitutive splicing in vitro, but both activated enhancer-dependent splicing in a sequence-specific manner and restored it after inhibition with competitor RNA. Our findings indicate that mammalian Tra2 proteins are sequence-specific splicing activators that likely participate in the control of cell-specific splicing patterns."

Overexpression of the PGS1 gene product under the inducible GAL1 promoter resulted in a 14-fold increase in in vitro PG-P synthase activity. Disruption of the PGS1 gene in a haploid strain of yeast did not lead to a loss of viability but did result in a dependence on a fermentable carbon source for growth, a temperature sensitivity for growth, and a petite lethal phenotype. The pgs1 null mutant exhibited no detectable in vitro PG-P synthase activity and no detectable CL or phosphatidylglycerol (PG); significant CL synthase activity was still present. The growth arrest phenotype and lack of PG-P synthase activity of a pgsA null allele ofEscherichia coli was corrected by an N-terminal truncated derivative of the yeast PG-P synthase.

In yeast all of the steps after CDP-DAG formation appear to be associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane (3Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while CDP-DAG is synthesized by a single gene product localized to both the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (5Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol.

Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4115-4117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PG-P synthases have been well characterized in several prokaryotic organisms and share significant amino acid homology along with a motif common to phosphatidyltransferases and enzymes that bind CDP-alcohols (7Hjelmstad R.H.

No eukaryotic gene encoding PG-P synthase activity has been identified, and the open reading frame derived from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequence most homologous to bacterial PG-P synthases actually encodes CL synthase (13Chang S.-C.

Interestingly, there is a divergence between prokaryotic organisms and eukaryotic organisms including S. cerevisiae (16Hirshberg C.B. Kennedy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1972; 69: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Tamai K.T. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in the final step of CL biosynthesis (Fig. 1), which would explain the lack of homology between bacterial and yeast CL synthases. Since there is also no homology in either amino acid sequence or reaction mechanism among eukaryotic and prokaryotic phosphatidylserine synthases (18Kuge O. Nishijima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Yamashita S. Nikawa J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Matsumoto K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 214-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), there may also be a similar divergence between eukaryotic and prokaryotic PG-P synthases. A mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cells in the synthesis of PG and CL (21Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22908-22913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Suzuki K. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22914-22919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when grown at the restrictive temperature, displayed a 10-fold reduction in the level of PG-P synthase activity, a reduction in the rate of labeling of the PG and CL, and a 10-fold and 3-fold reduction in the steady state levels of PG and CL, respectively. This mutant has defects in electron transport and ATP production, shows reduced oxygen utilization, and has an increased rate of glycolysis. In addition there are distinct changes in mitochondrial morphology. Although anionic phospholipid synthesis is compromised in this mutant, there is no definitive evidence that the defect is in the gene encoding PG-P synthase or that the physiological consequences of this mutation are due to loss of PG and/or CL. The mitochondrial defects noted in this somatic cell mutant are not surprising, given the biochemical evidence for the involvement of CL in many mitochondrial membrane associated processes (23Hatch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 159: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Hoch F.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 71-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). However, since yeast mutants lacking CL and CL synthase have elevated levels of PG but are only partially compromised for growth on non-fermentable carbon sources (13Chang S.-C. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. FASEB J. 1997; 11 (abstr.): A1079Google Scholar, 15Tuller G. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Schiefthaler U. Klein F. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), PG may substitute for CL in many important mitochondrial functions. E. coli mutants (null inpgsA) unable to make PG and CL are not viable (25Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and have been used to demonstrate a requirement for PG in protein translocation across the inner membrane (26de Vrije T. de Swart R.L.

A. 1995; 92: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, E. coli mutants lacking CL synthase have few remarkable phenotypes, indicating that PG can also substitute for all critical functions of CL in E. coli (31Nishijima S. Asami Y. Uetake N. Yamagoe S. Ohta A. Shibuya I. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 775-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hiraoka S. Matsuzaki H. Shibuya I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, isolation of mutants defective in both PG and CL biosynthesis in eukaryotic cells is necessary to study the role of these anionic phospholipids in cell function. Several nuclear mutations in yeast have been isolated that are viable except when carried in mitochondrial petite mutant backgrounds (i.e. rho − or rho 0mutants) and have been named pel mutants forpetite lethal (33Janitor M. Subik J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutants in PEL1(33Janitor M. Subik J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 34Subik J. FEBS Lett. 1974; 42: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are unique within this group in that they cannot grow on synthetic medium using a non-fermentable carbon source, are temperature-sensitive for growth on glucose, and have very low cytochome c oxidase content. The PEL1 gene is non-allelic with genes encoding processes known to be directly involved in oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting that this single nuclear mutation indirectly affects processes necessary for oxidative phosphorylation. These characteristics by themselves would not suggest a mutation in mitochondrial phospholipid metabolism, but these mutants also lack CL (35Janitor M. Obernauerova M. Kohlwein S.D. Subik J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 140: 43-47PubMed Google Scholar); lack of PG was not investigated. In addition the PEL1 gene product has some suggestive homology (36Janitor M. Jarosch E. Schweyen R.J. Subik J. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1223-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with the E. coli pssA gene product (phosphatidylserine synthase, which also uses CDP-DAG as a substrate), with a number of phospholipases D, and even more remotely with the E. coli CL synthase (37Ponting C.P. Kerr I.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The PEL1 gene has been suggested to encode a second minor phosphatidylserine synthase activity in S. cerevisiae (and has also been denoted as PSS2; Ref. 38Mosse M.-O. Linder P. Lazowska J. Slonimski P.P. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 66-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) based solely on sequence homology comparisons even though yeast cells carrying multiple copies of this gene in a cho1 (encodes the major yeast phosphatidylserine synthase) null mutant background still lack this synthase activity (35Janitor M. Obernauerova M. Kohlwein S.D. Subik J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 140: 43-47PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the above observations, we investigated the possibility that the PEL1 gene encodes PG-P synthase activity, which is consistent with the many of the above observations.

Bacterial strains were grown in LB medium (1% Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% Bacto-yeast extract, 1% NaCl, pH 7.4) and supplemented with antibiotics when needed for plasmid selection as described previously (25Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strain HD38 carries a null allele of the pgsA gene and is absolutely dependent for growth on a gene encoding PG-P synthase activity. The presence of plasmid pHD102 will support growth of strain HD38 at 30 °C but not 42 °C because the plasmid itself is temperature-sensitive for replication, preventing daughter cells from inheriting a functional copy of the pgsA gene (25Heacock P.N.

YPD medium consisted of 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% dextrose. In YPGly or YPGal medium, 2% glycerol or galactose, respectively, replaced dextrose as the carbon source.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) using Bio101 drop out medium plus required amino acids where appropriate, yeast nitrogen base with vitamins, and the indicated carbon source (D, dextrose; Gal, galactose; Gly, glycerol) at 2% (w/v). Yeast selection media contained the components of CSM except those noted for selection purposes (i.e. minus uracil, −Ura; minus histidine, −His). All the above media were supplemented with 2% agar (yeast) or 1.5% agar (E. coli) for growth on plates.Table IStrains and plasmidsStrains or plasmidsRelevant characteristics1-aPartial list of genetic markers.Reference or sourceE. coli HD38/pHD102pgsA30::kanR, recA/pgsA+, cam R(25Heacock P.N.

BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 538-539PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed by the lithium acetate protocol (46Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Johnston J.A. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: Practical Approaches. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 121-134Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA was prepared as described previously (47Ferbeyre G. Villareal A. Morales J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 386PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA to be sequenced was purified by using the Wizard™ 373 kit (Promega), and DNA sequencing reactions were performed by the Taq Dye-deoxy Terminator (Applied Biosystems) method and run on an Applied Biosystems Sequenator as a service provided by the Molecular Genetics Core Facility, University of Texas Medical School, Houston, TX. DNA fragments to be sequenced were carried in plasmid pBluescript™ II KS (Stratagene) and were sequenced by using the T7 and T3 primers or specific primers derived from the determined sequence. Sequence analysis was carried out with the Pileup program in GCG (48Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). For both analytical and preparative purposes, PCR was performed after optimizing conditions as described previously (49Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990Google Scholar). Amplification of the PGS1 gene from yeast chromosomal DNA employed primers based on the most recently updated DNA sequence (reported under GenBank™ accession numberZ48162), which indicates that open reading frames YCL4w and YCL3w reported in the Saccharomyces Genome Data Base 2Cherry, J.

Primer 1 (below) was designed to introduce both aHindIII site (underlined) for cloning and a prokaryotic ribosomal binding site (in italic type) 5′ to the putative start codon (in bold) of the PGS1 gene; bases changed from the reported DNA sequence are indicated in lowercase. Primer 2 was designated in a similar manner except it was designed to begin priming 5′ to the second methionine (Met-30) in the putative sequence (see Fig. 2), and it contains a BamHI site for cloning purposes. Primer 3 contains an EcoRI site and was designed to begin priming 846 bp from the 3′ end of the PGS1 gene.

The Genius™ 1 kit was used according to the manufacturer's directions for preparation of and detection with nonradioactive DNA probes. The kit utilizes random priming of template DNA and incorporation of digoxigenin-dUTP into the probe. Templates were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, extracted by using the QIAEX™ II gel extraction kit, and used for the random-primed labeling reaction. An alkaline phosphatase-coupled antibody directed against digoxigenin was used to detect hybridization of probe, and subsequent addition of Phos™ 530 produced the chemiluminescent signal visualized using x-ray film. DNA samples were digested with restriction enzymes and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA samples were transferred to positively charged nylon membranes by capillary action using 20× SSC (3 mNaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) at room temperature. DNA was cross-linked to the membrane by using a UV Stratalinker™ 1800. The membrane was placed in standard hybridization buffer (5× SSC, 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% SDS, and 1% Genius™ 1 kit blocking reagent) for 2 h at 68 °C. After the addition of digoxigenin-labeled probe, hybridization was performed overnight at 68 °C in standard hybridization buffer. Following hybridization, membranes were washed twice for 5 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and twice for 15 min in 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C. Alkaline phosphatase activity was visualized by the addition of Phos™ 530. All cell fractionation procedures were performed at 4 °C by modification of a previously described procedure (50Carman G.M. Belunis C.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1983; 29: 1452-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cultures of yeast cells were grown to late log phase in CSMD or CSMGal with auxotrophic selection when appropriate. Cells were pelleted and washed with homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3m sucrose, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), resuspended in one volume of homogenization buffer, and frozen at −80 °C for later use. Cell suspensions (1 ml) were mixed with an equal volume of 0.5-mm silica/zirconium beads (Biospec Products), and cells were disrupted at 4 °C by mechanical shearing using a Mini-BeadBeater™ 8 (Biospec Products) for five 1-min bursts with intermittent 2-min pauses on ice. Unbroken cells and debris were pelleted twice by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min. An enriched mitochondrial pellet was obtained by subjecting the supernatant to centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 10 min in Sorvall SS-34 rotor, and the resulting pellet was washed twice with homogenization buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in 0.25 ml of 20% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol per ml of starting cell suspension using a Dounce homogenizer. The mitochondrial preparations were stored at −80 °C. PG-P synthase activity was measured by the incorporation of radiolabeled substratesn-[14C]glycerol 3-phosphate into the chloroform-soluble product PG-P (50Carman G.M. Belunis C.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1983; 29: 1452-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The assay was performed at 30 °C in the presence of 50 mm MES-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), 0.3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CDP-DAG, 0.5 mm sn-[14C]glycerol 3-phosphate (2,000–4,000 cpm/nmol), and 1 mm Triton X-100 in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction was stopped after 20 min by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.1 n HCl in methanol, and the lipids were extracted with 2 ml of chloroform and 3 ml of 1 mMgCl2. The chloroform phase was evaporated followed by addition of Universol scintillation fluid and determination of radioactivity using a scintillation counter. A unit of enzymatic activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of product/min under the assay conditions described above. The specific activity is defined as unit/mg of protein. CL synthase activity was measured by the conversion of [32P]PG to CL dependent on CDP-DAG as described previously (17Tamai K.T. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). [32P]PG was prepared by thin layer chromatography (51Fine J.B. Sprecher H. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 660-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from a chloroform/methanol extract (25Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of E. coli strain ADC90 labeled with [32P]orthophosphate during growth at 42 °C. For steady state labeling cells were grown in 5-ml aliquots of CSMD with auxotrophic selection when appropriate. [32P]Orthophosphate was added to a final concentration of 10 μCi/ml, and the cells were grown for 16 h (six generations beginning at an A600of 0.05) before harvesting by centrifugation at 1,500 ×g for 10 min. The cells were washed with 5 ml of H2O, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 0.6 ml of chloroform/methanol/0.1 n HCl (1:2:0.8, v/v) and approximately a 200-μl volume of 0.5-mm silica/zirconium beads was added. Carrier lipids (30 μg of an equal-ratio mixture of phospholipids including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, PG, and CL) were added. Cells were broken using a Mini-BeadBeater™ (Biospec Products) at maximal setting for 2 min. Cell debris was pelleted, and the supernatant was extracted after addition of 0.2 ml of chloroform and 0.2 ml of 0.1 n HCl, 0.5 m NaCl (52Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Gaynor P.M. Ho C.T. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 533-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The organic phase was separated by centrifugation and taken to dryness. Isolated radiolabeled phospholipids (ca. 10,000 cpm) were dissolved in chloroform and applied to HPTLC Silica Gel 60 plates for two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (53Esko J.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4474-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first dimension was developed from right to left (Fig. 4) with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:10, v/v). The second dimension was developed from bottom to top with chloroform/methanol/88% formic acid (65:25:10, v/v). The position of each spot was determined both by authentic standards (visualized by iodine staining and ninhydrin spray) as well as comparison to previous reports (53Esko J.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4474-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results were visualized by exposure to x-ray film, and for quantitative results the radioactivity was counted in a Packard Instant Imager (Packard Instruments Inc.). Alternatively, one-dimensional thin layer chromatography was performed using boric acid-impregnated Silica Gel 60 plates (51Fine J.B. Sprecher H. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 660-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) developed in chloroform/methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide (60:37:5:3:1, v/v). Phospholipid content is expressed as mol % of total phospholipid based on the radiolabel in each spot and its respective molar phosphate content.

At steady state these cells appear to possess four different cellular structures, in addition to phagolysosomes, where acid hydrolases were concentrated. The first site of hydrolase concentration was the early endosomes, which contained the bulk of the cellular cathepsin H. This enzyme was acquired by phagosomes significantly faster than the other hydrolases tested. The second distinct site of lysosomal enzyme concentration was the late endosomes which contain the bulk of cathepsin S. The third and fourth large pools of hydrolases were found in two functionally distinct types of dense lysosomes, only one of which was found to be secreted in the presence of chloroquine or bafilomycin. Among this secreted pool was soluble furin, generally considered only as a membrane-bound trans-Golgi network resident protein. Thus, the organelles usually referred to as “lysosomes” in fact encompass a growing family of highly dynamic but functionally distinct endocytic organelles.

Among this secreted pool was soluble furin, generally considered only as a membrane-bound trans-Golgi network resident protein. Thus, the organelles usually referred to as “lysosomes” in fact encompass a growing family of highly dynamic but functionally distinct endocytic organelles. De Duve's (1de Duve C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) now classic studies of the “lysosome” led to the concept that this membrane enclosed structure, visualized by the electron microscopic studies of Novikoff and others, defined a single type of acidic organelle that encloses all the mature acid hydrolases in the cell. That this simple view has survived so long (seee.g. Refs. 2Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis I. Kaff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. The Molecular Biology of the Cell. Garland Publishing Inc., New York1994: 610-618Google Scholar and 3Lodish H. Baltimore D. Besk B. Zipurski S.L. Matsudaira P. Darnell J. Molecular Cell Biology. 3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1995: 649-663Google Scholar) is surprising when one considers the extensive data published since approximately 1980 showing that in many cell types lysosomal enzymes at steady state are enriched in at least two physically distinct organelles, the so-called late endosomes (low density lysosomes or prelysosomes) and the structures now referred to as lysosomes (4Storrie B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1988; 111: 53-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Berg T. Gjøen T. Bakke O. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In human fibroblasts these two sets of organelles were shown to divide the total cellular acid hydrolase pool equally between them (6Rome L.H. Crain L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10763-10768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although in most cell types investigated 80–90% is usually maintained in the dense lysosomes (4Storrie B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1988; 111: 53-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The term lysosome is now operationally defined as the kinetically most distal compartment of the endocytic pathway that is relatively dense in fractionation studies and which is devoid of recycling receptors such as the two mannose 6-phosphate receptors (see Refs. 4Storrie B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1988; 111: 53-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and 7Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). We have previously proposed that the late endosomes and the dense lysosomes interact in some fashion such that the Lgp-Lamp family of (lysosomal) membrane proteins are in similar concentrations in the membranes of both organelles (8Griffiths G. Matteoni R. Back R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 441-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Griffiths G. Protoplasma. 1996; 195: 37-58Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). That the two sets of structures equilibrate in some way is also argued by cell-cell fusion experiments (11Deng Y. Storrie B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3860-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Deng Y.P. Griffiths G. Storrie B. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 571-582PubMed Google Scholar) and by other in vivo data (13Jahraus A. Storrie B. Griffiths G. Desjardins M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 145-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these two organelles are distinct as seen by the presence of high concentrations of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, as well as Rab7 in the late endosomes, but not in lysosomes of cells such as normal rat kidney or the presence of the regulatory subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in the late endosomes (as well as other locations) but not in lysosomes of Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (14Griffiths G. Hollinshead R. Hemmings B.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 691-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In J774 macrophages, which we used for this study, the two Rab proteins, Rab5 and Rab7, while mostly depleted from lysosomes are enriched in both early and late endosomes (15Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar), 1A. Jahraus, T. E. Tjelle, A. Habermann, B. Storrie, O. Ullrich, and G. Griffiths, submitted for publication. 1A. Jahraus, T. E. Tjelle, A. Habermann, B. Storrie, O. Ullrich, and G. Griffiths, submitted for publication. a clear difference to all the other cell types investigated (9Griffiths G. Protoplasma. 1996; 195: 37-58Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For these reasons we emphasize that the organelles operationally referred to here as early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes from J774 cells may not all be strictly equivalent to the organelles we and others have defined more precisely in cells such as normal rat kidney, baby hamster kidney, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, or hippocampal neurons (9Griffiths G. Protoplasma. 1996; 195: 37-58Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, these fractions from J774 cells have been extensively characterized in our previous studies (15Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar).1 There is also considerable evidence that, in addition to late endosomes and lysosomes, early endosomes can contain small but functionally significant amounts of some lysosomal enzymes (see Ref. 5Berg T. Gjøen T. Bakke O. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar for review). The simplest way to rationalize this early endosome pool is that it represents newly synthesized hydrolases that have been delivered in clathrin-coated vesicles that originate from the trans-Golgi network (16Ludwig T. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Le Borgne R. Schmidt A. Mauxion F. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22552-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the study by Ludwig et al. (16Ludwig T. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) significant amounts of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes were detected in the early endosomes by both biochemical and electron microscopic approaches. In the case of rabbit alveolar macrophages, Diment et al. (18Diment S. Leech M. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could show that ∼35% of the total cathepsin D activity was associated with “light endosomal membranes”; significantly, a fraction of this putative early endosome pool was at least transiently membrane-bound, by a mannose 6-phosphate-independent mechanism, suggesting the possibility of a specific and more residential association with the membranes of (early) endocytic organelles by an unknown mechanism. Indeed, the idea of a mannose 6-phosphate-independent mechanism for keeping a number of newly synthesized hydrolases membrane-bound at different stages in their transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the endocytic pathway is also consistent with many other lines of evidence (e.g.Refs. 18Diment S. Leech M. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cardelli J.A. Dimond R.L. Das R. Robbins P.

Biodegradable organisms such as bacteria, yeast, or protozoans as well as non-degradable particles such as carbon, asbestos, or latex beads can be taken up by phagocytosis, especially by macrophages and neutrophils. In most cases, after their formation phagosomes can fuse with elements of the endocytic pathway, a process enabling the transfer of hydrolytic enzymes into the phagosome. The available evidence argues that newly formed phagosomes can fuse with early endosomes (22D'Arcy Hart P. Young M.R. J. Exp.

Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we made use of our recent approach to prepare highly purified fractions of phagosomes (phagolysosomes) enclosing 1-μm latex beads (29Desjardins M. Huber L. Parton R. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Most of the data in this study deal with careful kinetic measurements of the parallel activities of 10 mostly well known acid hydrolases in these different organelles. The results argue that in J774 cells different acid hydrolases are selectively enriched in at least four different types of endocytic organelles at steady state. J774 cells were cultured as described previously (29Desjardins M. Huber L. Parton R. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). For experiments using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) 2The abbreviations used are: HRP, horseradish peroxidase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; PNS, postnuclear supernatant. over 70% confluent cells were incubated 30 min at 37 °C with 2 mg/ml HRP (type II, Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml mannan (Sigma, Munich), followed by a chase incubation of 30 or 90 min in marker-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For measurement of the secretion (HRP and cellular enzymes), the cell culture media were replaced, after a brief rinse with PBS, by 10 mm Hepes in PBS, with or without 180 μmchloroquine, and the cells were further incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Extracellular enzyme activities were determined in the cell culture supernatant after 5 min centrifugation at 1200 rpm. The intracellular activity of HRP was measured after extensive working of the cells with PBS at 4 °C in the lysate of harvested cells. In these experiments no significant amounts of cell-associated HRP could be detected when the cells were incubated under the same conditions at 4 °C (results not shown). For treatment with inhibitors, cells were incubated in the different preincubation, pulse, and chase media supplemented with 10 mm Hepes and either 100 nmbafilomycin A1, 180 μm chloroquine, or 20 μg/ml cycloheximide (all from Sigma, Munich). Late endosomes and lysosomes were isolated from one set of macrophages. The procedure was a modification of the method described by Tjelle et al. (15Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for the preparation of late endosomes and lysosomes, J774 cells were allowed to internalize ovalbumin-conjugated gold particles (10 nm) for 3 h and chased overnight to trace the bulk of gold into the lysosomal compartment. Cells with or without gold were homogenized and centrifuged at 750 × g for 7 min. For early endosomes the PNS were mixed 1:1 with 80% metrizamide in PBS, and this mixture was loaded at the bottom of a SW40 tube and then overlaid with 17% Percoll in homogenization buffer (HB-250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazote buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol) followed by a layer of 500 μl of HB. After centrifugation at 56,000 × g for 30 min, the early endosomes were collected from the top of the self-formed Percoll gradient. Late endosomes and lysosomes were isolated from a different set of macrophages using ovalbumin-conjugated gold particles (10 nm) to achieve a density shift between late endosomes and lysosomes. The gold was internalized into J774 for 3 h and chased overnight to trace the bulk of gold into the lysosomal compartment. The cells were homogenized and centrifuged at 750 × g for 7 min. The gold-containing fraction was found in the nuclear pellet, whereas the late endosome fraction stayed in the PNS. This PNS was layered onto 17% Percoll/HB with a 50% sucrose cushion underneath to eliminate gold particles left over in the PNS. After centrifugation at 56,000 × g for 1 h, the late endosomes accumulated as a band in the Percoll gradient close to the sucrose cushion. The nuclear pellet with the gold-containing lysosomes was resuspended in 17% Percoll/HB and layered onto a 64% sucrose cushion. A centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min separated the gold-filled lysosomes, which pelleted through the sucrose cushion, from the nuclei remaining on top of the gradient. The characterization of these fractions is described by Tjelle et al. (15Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar) and Jahraus et al.1 It was shown by Tjelle et al. (15Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar) and Jahraus et al. 1 that the transferrin receptor is enriched in the early endosomal fraction but is essentially below detection in both the late endosome and lysosome fractions. Moreover, the early endosome specific marker EEAI (31Mu F.-T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.-P. Tock E.P.C. Toh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) is detected only in the early endosome fraction by Western blotting.1 In contrast cathepsin S is highly enriched in the late endosome fraction.1. In addition early and late endosome fractions could be distinguished by kinetic studies with internalized horseradish peroxidase which forms a plateau in the early and late endosomes after a 5-min pulse and a 5-min pulse plus a 25-min chase, respectively. As for the late endosomes/lysosomes the kinetics of HRP entry into the (isolated) endocytic compartments varied slightly from experiment to experiment (15Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar).1 Although in some sets of experiments HRP reached the late endosome 5–10 min before it reached lysosomes (15Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar), the difference was insignificant in others.1 Nevertheless these two sets of organelles can be differentiated both by their structure (15Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar) and by their in vitro fusogenic properties.1 The preparation of phagosomes enclosing 1-μm latex beads was done exactly as described by Desjardins et al. (29Desjardins M. Huber L. Parton R. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The quantification of phagosome number was done using a 10–100-fold dilution by measurement of A at 600 nm. For the standard curve, latex bead solution with different number of beads was determined by counting them in a hemocytometer. The determination of protein was done by the BCA-Microassay (Pierce). Early endosomal vesicles or PNS were lysed by 10-fold dilution of the fraction in 5 mmcarbonate plus 150 mm NaCl at pH 11 or in 5 mmphosphate plus 150 mm NaCl at pH 7, supplemented with either 0.5% Triton X-100 or 0.5% saponin, or, according to the method of Ref. 32Authier F.

The samples were incubated under the different conditions for 30 min at 4 °C before the membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 40 min at 100,000 ×g and 4 °C in a Ti 70 rotor (Beckman). The enzyme activities were measured in the supernatant before and after the centrifugation as described below. HRP activities were determined at 37 °C, using as substrate 1,2-phenylenediamine (Sigma, Munich) in a concentration of 1 mg/ml in citric acid/phosphate buffer plus 0.13% hydrogen peroxide, and 1 n sulfuric acid was used as a stop reagent. Quantification was done spectrometrically via measurement at 490 nm. All cellular enzyme activities were measured fluorometrically after pretreatment of the cellular fractions with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min at 4 °C. The assays were performed at 37 °C with a substrate concentration of 0.1–1 mm using specific substrates, buffers, and pH for the different enzymes as listed in Table I with the exception of cathepsin S which was determined as described by Kirschke and Wiederanders (33Kirschke H. Wiederanders B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 500-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the case of cathepsin H some of the assays were also done in the presence of 1 μm puromycin to exclude the presence of aminopeptidase activity which also cleaves Arg-AMC (34Cohen M.L. Geary L.E. Wiley K.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 224: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that since the substrate used to detect cathepsin L (Z-Phe-Arg-AMC) may also react with cathepsin B (34Cohen M.L. Geary L.E. Wiley K.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 224: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar), we refer to this activity as cathepsin B + L. In contrast the substrate used to detect cathepsin B (Z-Arg-Arg-AMC) is specific for this enzyme (35Barrett A.J. Kirschke H.

The amounts of enzyme activities were expressed as units, where 1 unit is the amount of enzyme that cleaves 1 nmol of substrate per min. J774 macrophages were allowed to internalize 16 nm gold/BSA conjugates for 2 h at 37 °C followed by an overnight chase in medium free of gold. They were subsequently fed 5 nm gold/BSA for 5 min to fill early endosomes. The cells were removed with proteinase K fixed with 4% formaldehyde and cryosections prepared which were labeled with rabbit anti-rat cathepsin H (36Wiederanders B. Kirschke H. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1986; 45: 1421-1431PubMed Google Scholar) followed by 10 nm gold-protein A. Profiles of early endosomes (containing at least one 5-nm gold particle) and late endocytic structures (containing at least one 16-nm gold particle) were systematically sampled and photographed. The density of labeling for cathepsin H over early endosomes, late endocytic structure, and the nucleus control was carried out as described by Griffiths (10Griffiths G. Fine Structure Immunocytochemistry. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg1993: 137-203Crossref Google Scholar) using a systematic sampling procedure. The vesicular fractions were lysed by 10 cycles of thawing and freezing, followed by 10 strokes through a 0.4 × 30 needle. After centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge to remove the gold,i.e. in the lysosomal fraction, different amounts of the supernatants, containing 1–3 μg of protein, were coated on microtiter plates (Greiner, Nürtinpen) by incubation in 0.44% carbonate buffer overnight at 4 °C. As a standard, different amounts (2–120 ng) of human liver cathepsin H (Sigma, Munich) were coated in the same way. Blocking was done by incubation with 1% BSA in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1.5 h at 37 °C. For detection we used as primary antibody the rabbit anti-rat cathepsin H antibody, described above, in a concentration of 9 μg/ml in PBS, 0.1% BSA. As a second antibody we used a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with HRP (Bio-Rad, Munich) in a working dilution of 1:500 in PBS. The incubation time for each antibody was 1 h at 37 °C. The quantification of bound HRP activity was carried out as described above. By using the method developed by Tjelle et al. (15Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar) we prepared enriched fractions of the three different endocytic compartments in J774 cells, namely early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes. The rationale for this approach is to allow cells to internalize ovalbumin-coated gold particles (10 nm) which were then chased overnight into late endocytic structures. As seen by electron microscopy the bulk of this gold is found in large aggregates in mostly spherical vesicles (lysosomes), whereas low levels of gold are present also in other more heterogeneous structures which we define as late endosomes (see Fig. 3 and Ref. 9Griffiths G. Protoplasma. 1996; 195: 37-58Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Following homogenization the bulk of the gold-containing organelles pelleted at low speed with the nuclear fraction; from this the lysosomal fraction could be purified using a second centrifugation on a Percoll gradient. The PNS from this preparation was used to enrich the late endosomes, and the PNS from a separate set of cells was used to prepare the early endosome fraction. For details of the characterization of these three different fractions, see “Materials and Methods.” When the three endocytic fractions were assayed for the activities of 11 different acid hydrolases, 9 behaved as expected with the bulk of activities in the lysosomal fraction. The rest of the activities of these nine enzymes was distributed as expected from earlier studies (4Storrie B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1988; 111: 53-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with more in the late endosome fraction than in the early endosomes (Fig. 1). There were three exceptions to this general pattern. The first was β-hexosaminidase whose activity in the early endosome fraction was significantly higher than that found in the late endosomes. The second and most striking exception to the general pattern was cathepsin H in that the bulk of the activity (∼70%) of this cysteine protease was restricted to the early endosome fraction (Fig. 1). Since cathepsin H is known to have both endopeptidase and aminopeptidase activity (35Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to rule out the possibility that we were assaying an aminopeptidase activity. The activities of cathepsin H in all subcellular fractions were found to be insensitive to 1 μm puromycin (data not shown), so that a contribution of cellular aminopeptidases (34Cohen M.L. Geary L.E. Wiley K.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 224: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar, 37Johnson G.D. Hersh L.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) could be excluded. Since the activity of this enzyme in the early endosome fraction was not significantly affected by treatment of the cells for up to 3 h with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide before isolation of the fractions (results not shown) it appears that, for the most part, cathepsin H in the early endosome pool is probably resident rather than a transient passenger. After the experimental part of this project was completed, we found in a parallel study1 that cathepsin S was highly enriched in the late endosome fraction by immunoblot analysis. We therefore analyzed the activity of this protease in the three fractions. As seen in Fig. 1 also the activity of this enzyme is significantly higher in the late endosome fraction, alt"
https://openalex.org/W2084412673,"The earliest known left-right asymmetric genes are expressed at Hensen's node during chick gastrulation. Gene expression following reorientation of the node shows asymmetry is instructed by adjacent tissue, hence left-right information originates outside the node. Subsequently, the node signals back to the lateral tissue, initiating a cascade leading to left-sided expression of nodal in the lateral plate mesoderm. Loss of nodal expression in the presence of blocking antibodies confirms that Sonic hedgehog is the key signal conveying left-right information from the node; however, manipulation of explant cultures suggests that the induction of nodal requires secondary signals produced in the paraxial mesoderm. These experiments establish the time of action of these signals to and from Hensen's node in establishing left-right asymmetry."
https://openalex.org/W2003724801,"In B16 melanoma cells, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are activated during cAMP-induced melanogenesis (Englaro, W., Rezzonico, R., Durand-Clément, M., Lallemand, D., Ortonne, J. P., and Ballotti, R. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 24315–24320). To establish the role of the MAP kinases in melanogenesis, we studied the effects of a specific MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD 98059 on different melanogenic parameters. We showed that PD 98059 inhibits the activation of MAP kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 by cAMP, but does not impair the effects of cAMP either on the morphological differentiation, characterized by an increase in dendrite outgrowth, or on the up-regulation of tyrosinase that is the key enzyme in melanogenesis. On the contrary, PD 98059 promotes by itself cell dendricity and increases the tyrosinase amount and activity. Moreover, down-regulation of the MAP kinase pathway by PD 98059, or with dominant negative mutants of p21ras and MEK, triggers a stimulation of the tyrosinase promoter activity and enhances the effect of cAMP on this parameter. Conversely, activation of the MAP kinase pathway, using constitutive active mutants of p21ras and MEK, leads to an inhibition of basal and cAMP-induced tyrosinase gene transcription. These results demonstrate that the MAP kinase pathway activation is not required for cAMP-induced melanogenesis. Furthermore, the inhibition of this pathway induces B16 melanoma cell differentiation, while a sustained activation impairs the melanogenic effect of cAMP-elevating agents. In B16 melanoma cells, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are activated during cAMP-induced melanogenesis (Englaro, W., Rezzonico, R., Durand-Clément, M., Lallemand, D., Ortonne, J.

Melanocytes are specialized cells located at the basal layer of the epidermis that synthesize and transfer melanin pigments to surrounding keratinocytes leading thereby to a uniform skin pigmentation. In vivo, melanin pigments play a key photoprotective role against the carcinogenic effects of solar ultraviolet light, which is in other respects the physiologic stimulus of melanogenesis (1Friedmann P.S. Gilchrest B.A. Cell. 1987; 133: 88-94Google Scholar, 2Aberdam E. Roméro C. Ortonne J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1015-1022PubMed Google Scholar). UV radiation can act directly on melanocytes or indirectly through the release of keratinocyte-derived factors that regulate melanogenesis (3Roméro-Graillet C. Aberdam E. Biagioli N. Massabni W.

Among the agents secreted by keratinocytes upon UV-B treatment, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) 1The abbreviations used are: MSH, melanocyte-stimulating hormone; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; DOPA, dihydroxyphenylalanine; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MBP, myelin basic protein. is one of the most potent activators of melanogenesis. Indeed, addition of α-MSH in cultured human melanocytes (5Hunt G. Todd C. Creswell J.E. Thody A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 205-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in melanoma cells (6Hill S.E. Buffey J. Thody A.J. Oliver I. Bleehen S.S. MacNeil S. Pigm. Cell Res. 1989; 2: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) stimulates melanization. Further, subcutaneous injection of this hormone causes a strong stimulation of the local pigmentation in humans (7Levine N. Sheftel S.N. Eytan T. Dorr R. Hadley M.E. Weinrach J.C. Ertl G.A. Toth K. Mc Gee D.L. Hurby V.J. J. A. M. A. 1991; 226: 2730-2736Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). α-MSH binds to a G protein-coupled heptahelical receptor leading to the activation of Gαs protein and to an increase in intracellular cAMP content. In cultured melanoma cells, the melanogenic effect of α-MSH can be mimicked by other cAMP-elevating agents such as cholera toxin, forskolin, and isobutylmethylxanthine (8O'Keefe F. Cuatrecasas P.

These observations emphasize the pivotal role of cAMP in the regulation of melanogenesis, but the cellular signaling events connecting the rise in cAMP to the stimulation of melanin synthesis are still incompletely clarified. Melanin biosynthesis or melanogenesis consists in a cascade of enzymatic and spontaneous reactions that converts tyrosine to melanin pigments. The initial and rate-limiting step in melanin synthesis, the hydroxylation of tyrosine to l-DOPA, is controlled by tyrosinase that is the key enzyme in this process. Stimulation of melanogenesis by cAMP-elevating agents, as well as by other melanogenic agents, implies an increase in tyrosinase protein amount as the consequence of the stimulation of the tyrosinase gene transcription (11Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J.-P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Concerning the early events induced by cAMP increase, we have recently demonstrated that cAMP-elevating agents inhibit the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p70S6 kinase activities (12Buscà R. Bertolotto C. Ortonne J.-P. Ballotti R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31824-31830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Further, the inhibition of these activities by pharmacological inhibitors mimics the melanogenic effect of α-MSH or forskolin, suggesting that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p70S6kinase inhibition by cAMP-elevating agents is a key event in the regulation of melanogenesis by these agents. The MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 are serine/threonine kinases that are activated upon phosphorylation by the dual specificity MAP kinase kinase or MEK. MEK is phosphorylated and activated by Raf-1, which is itself activated by p21ras (13Moodie S. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Upon activation, MAP kinases translocate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate and activate many transcription factors of which ternary complex factor/serum response factor and activator protein-1 are the most studied (14Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 15Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Derijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24315-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We have also observed a translocation of ERK1 to the nucleus, with a concomitant stimulation of activator protein-1 DNA binding activity. Further, stimulation of melanogenesis, which is associated with morphological changes characterized by an increased cell dendricity, reflects the differentiation of melanocytes and melanoma cells. These observations led us to hypothesize that the MAP kinase pathway could be involved in the regulation of melanoma cell differentiation and, more precisely, that the activation of ERKs would be a required event in the induction of melanogenesis by cAMP-elevating agents in B16 melanoma cells. In the present report, using a pharmacological approach with a specific inhibitor of MEK (PD 98059) (19Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar) and a molecular approach with constitutively active or dominant negative mutants of MEK and p21ras, we clearly demonstrated that cAMP-elevating agents can stimulate melanogenesis in the absence of MAP kinase activation, thereby invalidating our former hypothesis. Further, we showed that a sustained activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway led to a down-regulation of melanogenesis, demonstrating the involvement of this pathway in the control of B16 melanoma cell differentiation. Forskolin, TPA, l-DOPA, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), aprotinin, and leupeptin were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, LipofectAMINE reagent, and Optimem medium were from Life Technologies, Inc. PD 98059 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum to human tyrosinase (PEP-7) was provided by Dr. V. Hearing (Bethesda, MD). Antiserum to ERK1 was a generous gift from Dr. E. Van Obberghen (Nice, France). Expression vectors coding for the dominant positive and negative mutants of p21ras, respectively Val-12 p21 and Asn-17 p21 (20Gibbs J.B. Sigal I.S. Poe M. Scolnick E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5704-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 21Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), were provided by Dr. J.C. Chambard (Center de biochimie, Nice, France). Expression vector coding for constitutively active MEK (S222D) and constitutively inactive MEK (S222A) mutants were previously described (22Pagès G. Brunet A. L'Allemain G. Pouysségur J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3003-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). B16/F10 murine melanoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 7% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/50 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Serum-starved cells were treated as indicated, rinsed, and solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitors, aprotinin (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μm), and AEBSF (1 mm)). Then extracts were clarified by centrifugation and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with ERK1 antibody preadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with HNTG buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 0.2 mmNa3VO4). Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of HNTG buffer supplemented with 30 mm magnesium acetate, 15 μm cold ATP, and 0.2 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP) final concentrations. Reactions were initiated at room temperature by the addition of 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and stopped after 45 min by adding Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were then boiled for 5 min, and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12.5% acrylamide gel. The incorporation of 32P was visualized by autoradiography. Then film was scanned and bands were quantitated by densitometry using MacBas software. Tyrosinase activity was estimated by measuring the rate of oxidation of l-DOPA (23Takahashi H. Parsons P.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 481-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells grown in 6-well dishes were treated as indicated for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2% fetal calf serum. Then cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of phosphate buffer (0.1 m), pH 6.8, containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm AEBSF. Cellular extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 5 min. The tyrosinase substrate l-DOPA (2 mg/ml) was prepared in the same lysis phosphate buffer (without Triton). 40 μl of each extract were put in a 96-well plate, and the enzymatic assay was started by adding 100 μl of l-DOPA solution at 37 °C. Control wells contained 40 μl of lysis buffer. Absorbance at 570 nm was read every 10 min for at least 1 h at 37 °C using a microplate reader (Dynatech Laboratories). The blank was removed from each absorbance value, and a plot of absorbance against time was represented for each condition. The final activity was expressed in ΔOD/min/μg of protein for each condition. Cellular extracts were prepared as described above, and an equal amount of protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 10% acrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a Hybond-C extra membrane (Amersham Corp.), and the blot was probed with the PEP-7 polyclonal antibody (directed against tyrosinase) and with an anti-ERK1 polyclonal antibody (to verify that each lane was evenly loaded). Then proteins were visualized by the Amersham ECL system. B16 melanoma cells, plated in 24-well dishes, were transfected using the LipofectAMINE system according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reporter plasmid used consists in a 2.2-kilobase pair fragment of the mouse tyrosinase gene promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase gene and named 2.2 pMT-Luc (11Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J.-P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For determination of the PD 98059 effect, 0.25 μg/well of the reporter plasmid was transfected with 0.05 μg of pCMVβGal (Promega) to control the variability in transfection efficiency. In the experiments with mutants of MEK and Ras, the transfection was performed in the same conditions using, 0.25 μg of the reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of the expression vector, empty or containing the coding sequence of the different mutants, and 0.05 μg of pCMVβGal. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed with a saline phosphate buffer and lysed with 25 mm Tris-phosphate (pH 7.8) buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mmdithiothreitol. Soluble extracts were harvested and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. All transfections were repeated at least five times using different plasmid preparations and gave similar results. PD 98059 has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of MEK activity, the kinase functioning directly upstream of MAP kinases (19Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). We first verified whether this inhibitor was effectively able to inhibit ERK1 activity in B16 melanoma cells. ERK1 was immunoprecipitated from cells treated with TPA or forskolin and preincubated or not with PD 98059. The kinase activity was monitored with MBP as substrate (Fig. 1). Forskolin and TPA caused, respectively, about 2- and 8-fold induction of ERK1 activity. Preincubation of cells with 10 μm PD 98059 resulted in an almost complete inhibition of this induced kinase activity (respectively, 0.7- and 1.2-fold). Identical results were obtained on ERK2 (data not shown). Thus, PD 98059 inhibits the activation of MAP kinases in B16 melanoma cells. Then, we analyzed the effect of PD 98059 on B16 cell dendricity, which is the first observable parameter of melanoma cell differentiation (Fig. 2). Forskolin, which is a potent activator of melanogenesis, strongly stimulated dendritogenesis as compared with untreated cells. Addition of 10 μm PD 98059 in the culture medium was followed by an acquisition of the dendritic phenotype. Further, when cells were treated with forskolin plus PD 98059, dendricity was more pronounced than with forskolin or PD 98059 alone. It is worth remarking that α-MSH, at the concentration of 10−6m, exerted the same effect of forskolin by inducing dendritogenesis in B16 cells (data not shown). Hence, in our cell system, inhibition of MAP kinases by PD 98059 induces dendrite outgrowth and potentiates the morphological changes induced by cAMP-elevating agents. Induction of melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells is characterized by the stimulation of tyrosinase activity resulting from an increase in the tyrosinase protein expression. We therefore studied the effect of PD 98059 on these parameters. First, we measured tyrosinase activity in response to PD 98059. Cells were treated for 48 h with the MEK inhibitor and with forskolin. We then measured, in a cell-free system, the DOPA-oxidase activity that is the second specific activity of tyrosinase. As shown in Fig. 3 A, forskolin stimulated about 8-fold the tyrosinase activity, and we observed a 6-fold stimulation with PD 98059. Addition of forskolin together with PD 98059 allowed us to achieve almost a 10-fold stimulation of tyrosinase activity, suggesting that inhibition of MAP kinases potentiates the effect of forskolin on tyrosinase activity. We then measured the amount of tyrosinase protein in cells exposed to PD 98059. Cells were treated as described above, and Western blot analysis was performed using a specific antibody to tyrosinase (Fig. 3 B). Forskolin or PD 98059 markedly increased the amount of tyrosinase protein compared with the weak level of expression in untreated cells. Concomitant treatment with forskolin plus PD 98059 resulted in an even more pronounced up-regulation of tyrosinase expression. Thus, inhibition of MAP kinases by PD 98059 is sufficient to stimulate tyrosinase expression and activity. In a previous report we have shown that the effect of cAMP on melanogenesis is mediated through a stimulation of tyrosinase promoter activity, reflecting an activation of the tyrosinase gene transcription (11Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J.-P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Using a plasmid containing a 2.2-kilobase pair fragment of the tyrosinase promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase coding sequence as a reporter gene, we investigated whether the inhibition of MAP kinase led also to a stimulation of tyrosinase gene expression (Fig. 4). After transfection with the reporter plasmid, cells were incubated with forskolin, PD 98059, or forskolin plus PD 98059 for 48 h. We observed that PD 98059 alone stimulated luciferase activity 4-fold above the basal level. When forskolin was added to PD 98059, the luciferase activity reached a 9–10-fold stimulation, while forskolin alone induced a 8-fold stimulation. Hence, inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway by PD 98059 triggered an increase in tyrosinase gene expression and potentiate the effect of forskolin. It should be noted that the maximal effect on cell dendricity, melanogenesis, and tyrosinase promoter activity was observed with 10 μm PD 98059. To confirm the results obtained with the pharmacological inhibitor of MEK we have investigated the effect of dominant negative mutants of MEK and p21ras on the tyrosinase gene expression. p21ras is a small GTPase that activates Raf-1, the kinase that function upstream of MEK. These two mutants, that have respectively the ability to repress the endogenous activity of MEK and Ras, were cotransfected with the reporter plasmid (Fig. 5). In cells expressing the dominant negative mutants of MEK (MEK−), both basal and forskolin-stimulated tyrosinase promoter activities were increased about 3-fold compared with control conditions. The dominant negative mutant of Ras (Ras−) induced a 2-fold augmentation of the tyrosinase gene expression in basal and forskolin-treated cells. Thus, inhibition of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway by dominant negative mutants of Ras and MEK stimulates basal and cAMP-induced tyrosinase promoter activities. Since the inhibition of MAP kinases induces an augmentation of the tyrosinase gene expression, we wondered whether the expression of dominant positive mutants of p21ras (Ras+) and MEK (MEK+) would lead to an inhibition the tyrosinase gene promoter activity (Fig. 6). In cells co-expressing MEK+ and the reporter plasmid, we observed about a 2-fold decrease in luciferase activity in both basal and forskolin conditions. Expression of the dominant positive mutant of Ras (Ras+) appeared to be more potent to inhibit the forskolin-induced tyrosinase promoter activity. Thus, constitutively activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway leads to an inhibition of basal and cAMP-induced tyrosinase gene transcription. The different approaches used in this report clearly demonstrate that the inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway by a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK or by dominant negative mutants of Ras and MEK does not prevent the effects of forskolin on different parameters reflecting the stimulation of melanogenesis. On the contrary, inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway is sufficient to induce dendrite outgrowth and to increase tyrosinase expression and activity. Further, sustained activation of this pathway, by over expression of constitutively active Ras and MEK, inhibits basal and cAMP-induced tyrosinase promoter activities. These findings invalidated our initial hypothesis suggesting that the activation of ERK1 by forskolin in B16 melanoma cells was a key event in cAMP-induced melanogenesis. However, our present results disclose the link between the MAP kinase pathway and the regulation of melanoma cell differentiation and demonstrate that the activation of the MAP kinase pathway leads to the inhibition of melanogenesis and differentiation. At variance with our results, previous works have demonstrated that MAP kinases activation is required for the megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells (24Racke F.K. Lewandowska K. Goueli L.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1947-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), the neuronal differentiation of PC12 (17Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar) and the adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (18Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G.P. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, concerning the rat pheochromocytoma cells PC12, that share with melanocytes and melanoma cells the same embryonic origin (neural crest), some other reports have shown that MAP kinases activation is dispensable for neurite outgrowth and differentiation (26Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Iwasaki S. Hattori A. Sato M. Tsujimoto M. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17360-17365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly, infection by the v-Ha-ras oncogene was reported to inhibited melanogenesis in murine melanocytes (28Tsukamoto K. Ueda M. Hearing V.J. Pigm. Cell Res. 1992; (Suppl. 2): 181-184PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, neurofibromin that stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras, thereby leading to a sustained inactivation of Ras, was previously shown to increase the tyrosinase gene expression (29Suzuki H. Takahashi K. Yasumoto K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1984-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, consistently with our results, the inhibition of Ras would lead to a stimulation of melanogenesis while its activation would suppress melanogenesis. It is generally accepted that growth and differentiation are antinomic effects; cells cannot proliferate and differentiate at the same time. This general notion was supported by a recent report demonstrating that the differentiation of the neuroblastoma cell line NE1–115 characterized by the induction of neurite outgrowth is allowed when cells are arrested at the G1 phase of the cell cycle (30Kranenburg O. Scharnhorst V. Van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, Callus et al. (31Callus B. Tilbrook P.A. Busfield S.J. Cull V.S. Bittorf T. Klinken S.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have reported that treatment of J2E cells with amiloride suppressed the erythropoietin-induced proliferation and MAP kinase activity, and favored the differentiation of these cells. Thus inhibition of cell growth and interruption of cell cycle would commit the cell in a differentiation program. Our findings are more consistent with this notion. Keeping in mind the mitogenic role of MAP kinases that are required for cell proliferation and reentry in cell cycle after serum starvation (16Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.-C. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), we could expect that the inhibition of MAP kinase pathway would lead to the stimulation of B16 melanoma cell differentiation and of melanogenesis. Conversely, activation of the MAP kinase pathway and stimulation of cell growth would inhibit melanogenesis. This hypothesis is supported by the inverse correlation between cell growth and melanogenesis observed in numerous reports. Indeed, UV-B irradiation that is a potent melanogenic stimulus inhibits growth of cultured human melanocytes (32Medrano E.E. Im S. Yang F. Abdel-malek Z.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4047-4052PubMed Google Scholar). Growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor or TPA inhibit melanogenesis and stimulate growth of melanocytes (33Abdel-Malek Z. Swope V.B. Pallas J. Krug K. Nordlund J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that the stimulation of melanogenesis, by the inhibition of MAP kinases, cannot be solely explained by an inhibition of cell growth. Indeed, 10 μm PD98059 has only a very moderate inhibitory effect on growth of B16 cells, while inhibition of cell growth by serum depletion leads to faint increase in melanogenesis. Additionally, it should be noted that down-regulation of the MAP kinase pathway is thought to trigger cell cycle arrest in the G1phase (16Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.-C. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). During this phase, a number of cyclin-dependent kinases including Cdk2, 4, 5, and 6 are accumulated (34Franklin D.S. Xiong Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1587-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been recently shown that Cdk5 and its associated regulator protein p39 plays a critical role in neurite outgrowth during neuronal differentiation (35Xiong W. Pestell R. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6585-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We can therefore envision that the inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway would result in the accumulation of Cdk5, thereby explaining the stimulation of dendrite outgrowth by PD98059. Consistently, UV-B (32Medrano E.E. Im S. Yang F. Abdel-malek Z.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4047-4052PubMed Google Scholar) and cAMP (36Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), two potent melanogenic agents that stimulate dendricity, were also shown to block cells in G1 phase. The involvement of Cdk5 in the formation of dendrites induced by cAMP-elevating agents or by the MAP kinase pathway inhibition is an appealing hypothesis that needs to be confirmed. It seems surprising that the activation of MAP kinase leads to the inhibition of melanogenesis, since forskolin and α-MSH, two strong stimulators of melanogenesis, have been shown to activate MAP kinases (10Englaro W. Rezzonico R. Durand-Clément M. Lallemand D. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24315-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Hence, cAMP-elevating agents seem to trigger at least two different cascades of molecular events, one ending in the stimulation of melanin synthesis, and a second one decreasing melanogenesis through the activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Induction of antagonistic effects, by a single agent, has already been described in the literature. For instance, EGF activates MAP kinases which phosphorylate the EGF receptor, leading thereby to a decrease in the EGF binding (37Mothe I. Ballotti R. Tartare S. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Further, tumor necrosis factor-α induces apoptosis and the activation of NFκB that plays a key protective role against apoptosis (38Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 94-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We can envision that these opposite effects elicited by one agent can be involved in a fine tuning of a final biological effect. This retrocontrol would avoid overgrowth, overapoptosis, and over-melanin production that could be noxious for the cell. In summary, we clearly establish in this report that activation of the MAP kinase pathway is not a required event in the induction of melanogenesis. Furthermore, the activation of this pathway leads to an inhibition of melanoma cell differentiation demonstrating that the up-regulation of melanogenesis by cAMP-elevating agents is the consequence of the activation of two distinct and antagonistic pathways that might allow a precise control of melanocyte and melanoma cell differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2000111014,"Because insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin, and interleukin-4 (IL-4) have known biological effects in breast cancer cells and signal through insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) adaptor proteins, we examined the expression and function of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in breast tumors and cell lines. IRS-1 and IRS-2 were expressed by cell lines and primary breast tumor specimens. IGF-I, insulin, and IL-4 treatment of MCF-7 and ZR-75, and IGF-I treatment of T47-D breast cancer cells, resulted in much greater tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 compared with IRS-2. Furthermore, IGF-I stimulated greater tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 than either insulin or IL-4. IGF-I treatment also enhanced association of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with IRS-1 and stimulated increased enzymatic activity compared with IL-4 and insulin in all three cell lines. Similarly, mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was greater in IGF-I-stimulated cells. To determine the functional significance of the activation of these pathways, we inhibited activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with wortmannin and mitogen-activated protein kinase with PD098059. Both compounds inhibited IGF-stimulated growth, suggesting that both pathways contributed to the mitogenic response to IGF-I. We conclude that IRS-1, and not IRS-2, is the predominant signaling molecule activated by IGF-I, insulin, and IL-4.

Thus, identifying the key signaling pathways for IGFR1 may have implications for breast cancer.Interest in characterizing the molecules that bind to the activated receptor has led to the discovery that multiple adaptor proteins are involved in IGF signal transduction.

Adding to this complexity, both IRS-1 and IRS-2 can couple to multiple additional signaling pathways (Grb2, p85, Syp, and Nck), which could potentially result in a cascade of signals originating from the IGFR1 (14Yenush L. White M.F. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Recent results suggest that the IRS family may contain additional members (15Lavan B.E. Fantin V.R. Chang E.T.

Because IGFR1 is homologous to the insulin receptor, it was not surprising that both IRS-1 and IRS-2 are activated by the IGFs. However, additional ligands also activate the IRS proteins. Interleukin 4 (IL-4), a cytokine that stimulates B and T cell proliferation, also signals through the IRS proteins (17Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has also shown that other cytokines also use the IRS-2 signaling pathway (18Sun X.J. Pons S. Wang L.M. Zhang Y.T. Yenush L. Burks D. Myers M.G. Glasheen E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Because the pathways triggered by the IGFs and the signals mediated by the IRS adaptor proteins are complex, many of the studies demonstrating the function of these pathways have used transfection model systems. Although these systems are ideal for demonstrating protein-protein interactions, they are less well suited to identifying the biological effects of the activation of the signaling pathways. Interestingly, breast cancer cells have been shown to respond to IGF-I, IGF-II, and IL-4 (3Cullen K.J. Yee D. Sly W.S. Perdue J. Hampton B. Lippman M.E. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 48-53PubMed Google Scholar, 19Toi M. Bicknell R. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 1992; 55: 275-279Google Scholar, 20Blais Y. Gingras S. Haagensen D.E. Labrie F. Simard J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, unlike lymphocytes, which respond to IL-4 by increased proliferation, breast cancer cells are inhibited by IL-4 treatment. Thus, breast cancer cells can be used to identify signaling pathways activated by both the IGFs and IL-4, and the activation of specific pathways can be coupled to the growth response of the ligand. This study had two aims: first, to determine which signaling molecules are activated by the mitogen IGF-I in breast cancer cells, and second, to determine how IGF growth stimulatory and IL-4 growth inhibitory pathways differ in these cells.Here we show expression of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in human breast cancer cells and primary breast tumors and that in estrogen receptor-positive cell lines, IRS-1 was the predominant signaling molecule activated by IGF-I, insulin, and IL-4. IGF-I, compared with either IL-4 or insulin, resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Furthermore, increased IRS-1 phosphorylation by IGF-I was directly correlated with increased activation of the downstream effector molecules PI3 kinase and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Inhibition of PI3 kinase and MAP kinase activation showed that growth responses to IGF-I were mediated by both pathways. Thus, IRS-1 is the predominant signaling molecule phosphorylated by IGF-I, and multiple growth regulatory pathways are activated distally. Additionally, differences in the growth effects of IL-4 and IGF-I in breast cancer cells may be mediated by differential tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1.DISCUSSIONMany of the IGF signaling pathways have been demonstrated in transfected cell lines or with in vitro assay systems. These studies have revealed that a complex network of signaling events are activated by IGFR1 and its adaptor proteins. Two homologous adaptor proteins, IRS-1 and IRS-2, were identified as substrates for the insulin receptor. In addition, these adaptor proteins are involved in signaling by other receptor types, including IGFR1 and the IL-4 receptor (14Yenush L. White M.F. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined IRS-mediated signaling events in response to IGF-I, insulin, and IL-4 in three estrogen receptor-positive cell lines, MCF-7, ZR-75, and T47-D. In the IGF-I-unresponsive, estrogen receptor-negative cell lines MDA-231, MDA-468, MDA-435, and Hs-578T, very little or no IRS-1 activation was detected. Defects in the insulin/IGF signaling pathway have been previously documented in MDA-231 and MDA-468 cells (30Costantino A. Milazzo G. Giorgino F. Russo P. Goldfine I.D. Vigneri R. Belfiore A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1667-1676PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sepp-Lorenzino L. Rosen N. Lebwohl D.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1077-1083PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hs-578T cells do not express detectable IGFR1 mRNA (39Yee D. Lebovic G.S. Marcus R.R. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21439-21441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the physiologic role of IGF action in these ER− breast cancer cells is unclear.Because IGF-I, insulin, and IL-4 are known to have divergent effects on ER+ breast cancer cells, functional signaling pathways must exist, and differences in activation of these pathways may account for the differences in biological activity. Because we found that both IRS-1 and IRS-2 were present in breast cancer cell lines and tumors, we hypothesized that the differential effects of the ligands could be due to differential activation of the adaptor proteins. Other studies have suggested that IRS-2 (originally named 4PS (IL-4-phosphorylated substrate) is the primary mediator of IL-4 effects in hematopoietic cells, and we reasoned that IRS-2 would have a similar function in breast cancer cells. To our surprise, we discovered that IRS-2 is not the predominant substrate for IGF-I, insulin, or IL-4 receptors in MCF-7 or ZR-75 cells or for the IGF-I receptor in T47-D cells. Instead, IRS-1 appears to be the predominant signaling molecule activated by all three ligands. Furthermore, we found that IGF-I stimulated increased phosphotyrosine on IRS-1 compared with IL-4 or insulin, as evidenced by the slower migration of IGF-I-stimulated IRS-1 in all three cell lines and phosphotyrosine blotting of V-8-digested IRS-1 in MCF-7 cells.IRS-1 has over 20 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, which serve as binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins. These phosphorylated sites provide docking positions for a wide array of other signaling molecules, such as PI3 kinase, Grb 2, and Syp, creating the possibility of a complex, multidimensional signal sent to cells. In addition, IRS-1 can also activate signaling pathways in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation (40Myers M.G. Zhang Y.T. Aldaz G.A.I. Grammer T. Glasheen E.M. Yenush L. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4147-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although there have been many reports of differential IRS signaling in different cell types, there have been few reports on differential signaling through IRS-1 in the same cell by different ligands (35Wang L.-M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.-J. Aaronson S.A. White M.F. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Our data support the possibility that the level of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and coupling to downstream signaling pathways is dependent on the receptor type.Like other cells, activation of IRS-1 in breast cancer cells results in the downstream activation of several different signaling pathways. Although PI3 kinase has been shown to mediate the metabolic effects of insulin (41Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our studies suggest that PI3 kinase also mediates IGF-I mitogenic effects in breast cancer cells. In addition, MAP kinase also apparently regulates IGF-mediated mitogenesis. Dufourny et al. (42Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen H.A.A.M. van Schaik F.M.A. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) recently showed a 40% reduction in IGF-I-stimulated growth in MCF-7 cells using 20 μm PD098059. Despite this reduction, the authors concluded that MAP kinase was not required for mitogenesis because cyclin D1 expression and the hyperphosphorylation of Rb was not affected (42Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen H.A.A.M. van Schaik F.M.A. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Our inhibition of growth was similar (50–60%), but we did not study effects on gene expression distal to MAP kinase. Dufourny et al. (42Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen H.A.A.M. van Schaik F.M.A. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) also used detection of up-shifted ERK2 as a marker for MAP kinase activation, whereas we used phosphospecific MAP kinase antibody. Our reduction in growth was greater than theirs, and we were also unable to completely inhibit activation of MAP kinase, suggesting that phospho-specific MAP kinase antibody may be more sensitive in detecting activated MAP kinase. However, in both studies, when PD098059 was given with IGF-I, growth was inhibited. Thus, it is possible that MAP kinase contributes to the mitogenic pathway and utilizes downstream molecules other than Rb and cyclin D1 to affect proliferation.The central role of IRS-1 in breast cancer growth regulation has also been shown in transfection studies of MCF-7 cells. IRS-1 introduced into these cells results in enhanced cell growth and partial estrogen independence (43Surmacz E. Burgaud J.-L. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1429-1436PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that high IRS-1 levels were associated with early recurrence in node-negative breast cancer (21Rocha R.L. Hilsenbeck S.G. Jackson J.G. Van Den Berg C.L. Weng C.-N. Lee A.V. Yee D. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 103-109PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, IRS-1 is a key signaling molecule in breast cancer cells and initiates several mitogenic pathways. To interfere with IGF-mediated mitogenesis in breast cancer cells, targeting of IRS-1, or at steps proximal to its activation, could be an effective inhibitor of growth. Recently, studies using IRS-1 deficient fibroblasts have shown that expression of IRS-1 is not necessary for activation of MAP kinase (44Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Unlike our cells, these fibroblasts phosphorylate IRS-2 and Shc after IGF-I exposure, suggesting that cells of different origins may utilize different downstream signaling pathways to mediate IGF effects.Studies have shown that IL-4 is an inhibitor of breast cancer cell proliferation (19Toi M. Bicknell R. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 1992; 55: 275-279Google Scholar, 20Blais Y. Gingras S. Haagensen D.E. Labrie F. Simard J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, IL-4 inhibits estradiol-mediated growth of estrogen-responsive cells. This is in distinct contrast to the effects of IGF-I on breast cancer cell growth. IGF-I alone is a mitogen, and IGF-I plus estradiol results in additive, if not synergistic, growth effects (45McGuire Jr., W.L. Jackson J.G. Figueroa J.A. Shimasaki S. Powell D.R. Yee D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 1336-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because we did not detect any qualitative differences between IGF-I and IL-4 signaling via IRS-1 and IRS-2, several possible explanations for these differences may exist. First, it has been suggested that different subcellular localization of IRS-1 and PI3 kinase is responsible for different signals delivered by insulin and platelet-derived growth factor in 3T3 L1 adipocytes (46Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, after fractionation of subcellular compartments (47Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997Google Scholar), we were unable to detect any differences in the subcellular localization of IRS-1, PI3 kinase, and MAP kinase in MCF-7 or ZR-75 cells after stimulation with IGF-I, IL-4 and insulin (data not shown). Second, initiation of mitogenesis may require the crossing of an activation threshold of downstream signaling molecules. Thus, IGF-I is a mitogen because of its ability to more vigorously activate MAP kinase and PI3 kinase. If activation of the these pathways is less than optimal, as is the case for IL-4 and insulin stimulation or after wortmannin and PD098059 treatment, then the mitogenic response is similarly dampened. Although this may explain why IL-4 is not a mitogen, it does not readily explain how IL-4 could function to inhibit estradiol growth stimulation. Third, other pathways may also be activated by IL-4. It is well known that the JAK/stat pathway is required for IL-4 function in lymphocytes, and activation of these pathways could potentially be inhibitory in breast cancer cells (48Kotanides H. Moczygemba M. White M.F. Reich N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19481-19486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have found that IRS-1 co-immunoprecipitates with JAK3 antibody in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). IL-4 could also activate other members of the MAP kinase family, such as stress-activated protein kinase/jun kinase or p38. Both of these signaling pathways have been implicated in programmed cell death (49Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Diener K.M. Lange-Carter C.A. Gleavy J. Jarpe M.B. Minden A. Karin M. Zon L.I. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3229-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and activation of these pathways could account for the inhibitory effects of IL-4 on breast cancer cells.Thus, IRS-1, and not IRS-2, is a key signaling molecule for IGFR1 in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells. IGFR1 is a more potent activator of IRS-1 than either insulin or IL-4 receptor. We also observed a direct correlation between levels of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of PI3 kinase and MAP kinase, and cell growth. We suspect that IGFR1 creates additional or different SH2 binding sites on IRS-1 that enhance activation of downstream signaling molecules. Neither insulin or IL-4 could effectively activate these downstream signaling pathways through IRS-1, and they are, therefore, less efficient promoters of cell growth. We conclude that signaling through IRS-1 is responsible for the mitogenic effects of IGF-I in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines. It has become clear that both insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFR, IGF receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI3 kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; IL, interleukin; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; SFM, serum-free medium; TNESV, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBST, 0.15m NaCl, 0.01 m Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide. 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFR, IGF receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI3 kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; IL, interleukin; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; SFM, serum-free medium; TNESV, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBST, 0.15m NaCl, 0.01 m Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide. and IGF-II stimulate both normal and malignant breast cell proliferation (1Lee A.V. Yee D. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1995; 49: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice that overexpress IGF-II in mammary epithelial cells develop breast cancer, suggesting that IGF signaling may also participate in the transformation event (2Bates P. Fisher R. Ward A. Richardson L. Hill D.J. Graham C.F. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 1189-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Most evidence suggests that the tyrosine kinase type I IGF receptor (IGFR1) mediates the mitogenic signaling of both IGF-I and IGF-II (3Cullen K.J. Yee D. Sly W.S. Perdue J. Hampton B. Lippman M.E. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 48-53PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, specific tyrosine residues contained in the intracellular domain of the receptor have been shown to mediate mitogenesis, transformation, and survival (4Blakesley V.A. Kalebic T. Helman L.J.

https://openalex.org/W2329646608,"Using UvrABC incision in combination with ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR) we have previously shown that benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) adduct formation along the nontranscribed strand of the human p53 gene is highly selective; the preferential binding sites coincide with the major mutation hotspots found in human lung cancers. Both sequence-dependent adduct formation and repair may contribute to these mutation hotspots in tumor tissues. To test this possibility, we have extended our previous studies by mapping the BPDE adduct distribution in the transcribed strand of the p53 gene and quantifying the rates of repair for individual damaged bases in exons 5, 7, and 8 for both DNA strands of this gene in normal human fibroblasts. We found that: (i) on both strands, BPDE adducts preferentially form at CpG sequences, and (ii) repair of BPDE adducts in the transcribed DNA strand is consistently faster than repair of adducts in the nontranscribed strand, while repair at the major damage hotspots (guanines at codons 157, 248 and 273) in the nontranscribed strand is two to four times slower than repair at other damage sites. These results strongly suggest that both preferential adduct formation and slow repair lead to hotspots for mutations at codons 157, 248 and 273, and that the strand bias of bulky adduct repair is primarily responsible for the strand bias of G to T transversion mutations observed in the p53 gene in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2068418627,"The asymmetries of internal organs are consistently oriented along the left-right axis in all vertebrates, and perturbations of left-right orientation lead to significant congenital disease. We propose a model in which a ""left-right coordinator"" interacts with the Spemann organizer to coordinate the evolutionarily conserved three-dimensional asymmetries in the embryo. The Vg1 cell-signaling pathway plays a central role in left-right coordinator function. Antagonists of Vg1 alter left-right development; antagonists of other members of the TGFbeta family do not. Cell-lineage directed expression of Vg1 protein can fully invert the left-right axis (situs inversus), can randomize left-right asymmetries, or can ""rescue"" a perturbed left-right axis in conjoined twins to normal orientation (situs solitus), indicating that Vg1 can mimic left-right coordinator activity. These are the first molecular manipulations in any vertebrate by which the left-right axis can be reliably controlled."
https://openalex.org/W1985268943,"When unfolded proteins are accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), an intracellular signaling pathway termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated to induce transcription of ER-localized molecular chaperones and folding enzymes in the nucleus. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, at least six lumenal proteins including essential Kar2p and Pdi1p are known to be regulated by the UPR. We and others recently demonstrated that the basic-leucine zipper protein Hac1p/Ern4p functions as atrans-acting factor responsible for the UPR. Hac1p binds directly to the cis-acting unfolded protein response element (UPRE) responsible for Kar2p induction. Moreover, we showed that the KAR2 UPRE contains an E box-like palindrome separated by one nucleotide (CAGCGTG) that is essential for its function. We report here that the promoter regions of each of five target proteins (Kar2p, Pdi1p, Eug1p, Fkb2p, and Lhs1p) contain a single UPRE sequence that is necessary and sufficient for induction and that binds specifically to Hac1p in vitro. All of the five functional UPRE sequences identified contain a palindromic sequence that has, in four cases, a spacer of one C nucleotide. This unique characteristic of UPRE explains why only a specific set of proteins are induced in the UPR to cope with ER stress.

Eukaryotic cells possess multiple intracellular signaling pathways from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ORF, open reading frame; UPR, unfolded protein response; UPRE, unfolded protein response element; UPRF, unfolded protein response factor; kb, kilobase pair(s). to the nucleus (1Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 50-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One of these, the unfolded protein response (UPR), is conserved from yeast to man and is activated by accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER under a variety of stress conditions (“ER stress”), resulting in transcriptional induction of molecular chaperones and folding enzymes localized in the ER (2Lee A.S.

The UPR is thought to be activated primarily to cope with deleterious effects of accumulated unfolded proteins. In addition, the possible linkage of UPR with phospholipid biosynthesis, especially with inositol metabolism, and its involvement in ER homeostasis have also been suggested (6Cox J.S. Shamu C.E.

Budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model system in which to study the molecular mechanism of the UPR and has led to the identification of three genes as essential components of the UPR: the IRE1/ERN1 gene encoding a transmembrane protein kinase localized in the ER (6Cox J.S.

Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In contrast, all the known target proteins of the UPR are localized in the ER, where they assist folding and assembly of newly synthesized secretory and transmembrane proteins as molecular chaperones or folding enzymes (14Gething M.J.

A. 1993; 90: 5450-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Genes encoding each of these ER stress-inducible proteins are thought to contain an upstream activator sequence, termed the unfolded protein response element (UPRE), in their promoter region (26Partaledis J.A. Berlin V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5450-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Mori K. Sant A. Kohno K. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F.

Biol. 1993; 13: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). UPRE was originally identified as a cis-acting element necessary for transcriptional induction of Kar2p by ER stress, and the 22-base pair sequence is sufficient to confer inducibility on a heterologous promoter such as the yeast CYC1 promoter (27Mori K. Sant A. Kohno K. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2583-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 28Kohno K. Normington K. Sambrook J. Gething M.J. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). UPRE was proposed to be a binding site of a putative transcription factor termed unfolded protein response factor (UPRF) (27Mori K. Sant A. Kohno K. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2583-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A similar sequence found in the FKB2 promoter also conferred inducibility on the CYC1-lacZ gene (26Partaledis J.A. Berlin V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5450-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, whether induction of other ER stress-inducible proteins is mediated by a sequence similar toKAR2 and FKB2 UPREs remains to be investigated. Moreover, it is important to address the question of why only a limited set of proteins are transcriptionally induced in response to ER stress. We recently conducted extensive mutational analysis of KAR2UPRE to characterize its fine structure-function relationship (11Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). For convenience, we have numbered the nucleotides in UPRE, with nucleotide 1 the guanine at the 5′-end and nucleotide 22 the adenine at the 3′-end (see Fig. 1). Among the 22 nucleotides in KAR2 UPRE, nucleotides 10–12 (CAG) and 14–16 (GTG) were most critical for its function; point mutation of any of these nucleotides abolished the response to ER stress almost completely. The sequences CAG and GTG are reminiscent of the E box consensus (CANNTG), to whichtrans-acting factors containing a basic region as a DNA-binding domain would bind (29Hurst H. Protein Profile; Transcription Factors 1: bZIP Proteins. 2. Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar, 30Littlewood T. Evan G. Protein Profile; Transcription Factors 2: Helix-Loop-Helix. 2. Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar). However, KAR2 UPRE contained a single C residue between the half-sites (CAGCGTG) and this one-base spacing was critical for the response to ER stress. This unique spacing appeared to distinguish KAR2 UPRE from other cis-acting elements recognized by basic region-containing trans-acting factors (11Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We and others recently identified the basic-leucine zipper protein Hac1p/Ern4p as a transcription factor responsible for the UPR inS. cerevisiae; haploid cells lacking Hac1p were unable to induce transcription of any of the target proteins tested and exhibited sensitivity to ER stress (10Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 11Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 12Nikawa J. Akiyoshi M. Hirata S. Fukuda T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4222-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Hac1p was shown to bind specifically to the KAR2 UPRE using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (10Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 11Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). More importantly, we demonstrated that Hac1p recognizes the palindrome separated by a one-nucleotide spacer in KAR2 UPRE both in vivo and in vitro (11Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed that Hac1p is involved in induction of all known target proteins (11Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 31Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This indicated that, as in the case of KAR2 UPRE, the promoters of other target proteins might contain a palindromic sequence with a spacer of one nucleotide recognized directly by Hac1p. The yeast strains used in this study were KMY1005 (MATα leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2–801), KMY1015 (KMY1005ern1Δ::TRP1), and KMY2005 (MATα leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2–801 sec-53–6) (11Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The SCJ1 deletion (scj1Δ) strain SNY1025 (MATα leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2–801 suc2-Δ9 scj1Δ::TRP1) and its parental strain SEY6210 (32Nishikawa S. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12889-12892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were generous gifts of Drs. S. Nishikawa and T. Endo (Nagoya University). The compositions of rich broth medium (YPD) and synthetic complete medium used for selection of transformants such as SC(−Ura) have been described (33Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Tunicamycin was obtained from Sigma (T-7765) and used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml throughout the experiments. Yeast cells were transformed by the lithium acetate method (34Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA techniques were carried out as described (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The reporter plasmids pSCZ2 and pMCZ2 were constructed by modifying the CYC1-lacZfusion gene of the multicopy vector pLGΔ-178 (36Guarente L. Mason T. Cell. 1983; 32: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), a derivative of pLG670-Z (37Guarente L. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2199-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), which is often utilized to assess activities ofcis-acting elements in S. cerevisiae (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). Because the lacZ reporter gene in pLG670-Z as well as pLGΔ-178 is actually a translational fusion of lacI and lacZ (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar), we transferred the CYC1 portion in pLGΔ-178 into another lacZ-containing vector in frame. Thus, inserted into pUC118 was the 0.25-kbXhoI-BamHI fragment of the CYC1-lacZfusion gene in pLGΔ-178, which contained the entire CYC1promoter and 5′-terminal several nucleotides of the CYC1-coding region located upstream of the BamHI site (36Guarente L. Mason T. Cell. 1983; 32: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 37Guarente L. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2199-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). From the resulting plasmid, one nucleotide C between the start ATG codon and the BamHI site was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis (39Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar) so that the ATG codon would be in frame to the lacZ-coding sequence embedded in pSEYc102 (aCEN4-ARS1-based single-copy vector) or pSEY101 (a 2-μm-based multicopy vector), both containing the URA3selectable marker (27Mori K. Sant A. Kohno K. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2583-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The 0.25-kb EcoRI (derived from the multicloning site of pUC118)-BamHI fragment of the mutagenized CYC1 gene was inserted between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pSEYc102 and pSEY101 to create the single-copy vector pSCZ2 and multicopy vector pMCZ2, respectively. pMCZ2 possesses unique EcoRI and XhoI sites upstream of the CYC1 promoter for inserting oligonucleotides, whereas pLGΔ-178 contains only oneXhoI site. Various double-stranded, synthetic oligonucleotides whose 5′- and 3′-termini are complementary to protruding termini generated by EcoRI and XhoI, respectively, were inserted between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pMCZ2. Comparison of β-galactosidase activity expressed from pLGΔ-178 and pMCZ2 suggested that the presence of the lacI portion between CYC1 and lacZ represses the expression of β-galactosidase. First, pMCZ2 produced considerably higher basal β-galactosidase (24 units) than pLGΔ-178 (1 unit) in unstressed cells. Second, the absolute units of β-galactosidase produced from pMCZ2 containing the wild-type UPRE-Y in cells incubated in the presence of tunicamycin for 3 h was 3-fold higher than those from pLGΔ-178 containing UPRE-Y. Third, activity of UPRE-A, a point mutant of UPRE-Y described previously (27Mori K. Sant A. Kohno K. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2583-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), was 3% of that of UPRE-Y when inserted into pMCZ2, whereas it was almost negligible (0.3% of UPRE-Y) when inserted into pLGΔ-178. These results indicated that, although the extent of induction with pMCZ2 containing UPRE-Y is lower than that with pLGΔ-178 containing UPRE-Y (50∼60-foldversus 200∼300-fold induction by tunicamycin treatment for 3 h), β-galactosidase assay with pMCZ2 provides higher sensitivity for detecting weakly active elements than that with pLGΔ-178. The 2.5-kbApaI-PstI fragment containing the entirePDI1 gene in the plasmid pMTY17 (24Tachikawa H. Miura T. Katakura Y. Mizunaga T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was cloned into pUC118, and a BamHI site was created immediately downstream of the start ATG codon (ATGGATCC- - -) by site-directed mutagenesis. The 0.44-kb ApaI-BamHI, 0.30-kbBstBI-BamHI, 0.21-kbSpeI-BamHI, or 0.09-kbMluI-BamHI fragment of the PDI1promoter was inserted between the SmaI and BamHI sites of pSEYc102. Two point mutations were introduced toPDI1a UPRE by site-directed mutagenesis. The plasmid pCT20 carrying both the EUG1 and FKB2genes in tandem was kindly provided by Dr. T. H. Stevens (University of Oregon), and the 2.8-kbHindIII-SalI fragment was cloned into pUC119. The genomic LHS1 gene with franking regions was obtained by screening the yeast genomic library constructed on YEp13, a multicopy yeast vector (ATCC 37323, Ref. 40Nasmyth K.A. Reed S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and the 1.6-kb EcoRV fragment was cloned into pUC118. A BamHI site was created immediately downstream of the start ATG codon ofEUG1, FKB2, or LHS1 (ATGGATCC- - -). The 0.19-kb HindIII-BamHI fragment ofEUG1, 0.29-kb AccI-BamHI fragment ofFKB2, or 0.27-kb BstXI-BamHI fragment of LHS1 was inserted between the SmaI and BamHI sites of pSEY101. Two point mutations were introduced to EUG1 UPRE, FKB2 UPRE, or LHS1UPRE. The plasmid pPS177 carrying the entire SCJ1 gene was kindly provided by Dr. P. A. Silver (Harvard Medical School). The 3.0-kbKpnI-HindIII fragment was transferred to pRS316 (a CEN6-ARSH4-based single-copy vector containing the URA3 selectable marker, Ref. 41Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to create pRS316-SCJ1. The 1.2-kb KpnI-SphI fragment of pPS177 was cloned into pUC118, and a BamHI site was created immediately downstream of the first or second ATG codon (ATGGATCC- - -). The KpnI-BamHI,StyI-BamHI, AflIII-BamHI, or HgaI-BamHI fragment was inserted between the SmaI and BamHI sites of pSEY101. β-Galactosidase assays and Northern blot hybridization analysis were carried out as described previously (7Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 11Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described (11Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared from the wild-type strain (KMY1005) that had been grown in YPD medium to a mid-log phase and incubated for 1 h with tunicamycin, and proteins were fractionated by ammonium sulfate according to our previous report (31Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Hac1p of 238 amino acids was translated in vitro using TNT™-coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega) and a template HAC1 DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. We constructed the reporter plasmids pSCZ2 (a single-copy vector) and pMCZ2 (a multicopy vector) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These plasmids contained a modified version of the CYC1-lacZ gene of pLGΔ-178 (36Guarente L. Mason T. Cell. 1983; 32: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and provided a sensitive and convenient assay system for examiningcis-acting elements in S. cerevisiae. Using pMCZ2, we showed that the KAR2 UPRE (previously referred to as UPRE-Y, Ref. 27Mori K. Sant A. Kohno K. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2583-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) contained a partial palindrome separated by one nucleotide (Fig. 1); nucleotides 10–12 (CAG) and 14–16 (GTG) were most critical (boxed), and nucleotides 8 (G), 13 (C), and 18 (C) were also important for UPRE activity (11Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In previous experiments to dissect the UPRE, β-galactosidase activity was measured in cells incubated in the presence or absence of tunicamycin, which is known to elicit ER stress by inhibiting N-glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins in the ER (3Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1988; 332: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 42Elbein A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1981; 6: 219-221Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Since tunicamycin treatment may cause pleiotropic defects in cellular metabolism, the response of the lacZ gene in pMCZ2 to ER stress was confirmed here at the mRNA level using the temperature-sensitive sec53 strain (Fig. 1). At the nonpermissive temperature, sec53 cells accumulated full-length precursors of secretory proteins, which were abnormally glycosylated and malfolded in the ER due to the defect in phosphomannomutase activity (43Feldman R.I.

Total RNAs were isolated from transformants that had been grown at the permissive temperature of 23 °C or after shifting to the semi-nonpermissive temperature of 30 °C for 90 min. KAR2 mRNA transcribed from the chromosomal gene was markedly induced at 30 °C in all transformants examined, because Kar2p expression was under the control of the KAR2 promoter containing a functional UPRE. In contrast, lacZ mRNA was not induced at 30 °C in sec53 cells carrying pMCZ2 alone. When UPRE-Y was inserted into pMCZ2, lacZ mRNA was markedly induced at 30 °C, indicating that transcription of the UPRE-CYC1-lacZ gene was induced only if unfolded proteins had accumulated in the ER regardless of the nature of the stress employed. Moreover, only slightly decreased response was observed when UPRE-Y was inserted in the opposite orientation, showing that UPRE functions as an upstream activator sequence regardless of its orientation. LHS1 UPRE is indeed in the opposite orientation to other functional UPREs (see Fig. 5). The cellular activity for specific binding to UPRE, namely UPRF activity, was detected only in ER-stressed cells (10Cox J.S. Walter P.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); binding to the wild-type UPRE-Y was obtained with extracts prepared from tunicamycin-treated cells (Fig. 2 A) but not from untreated cells (data not shown). This binding was specific because UPRF did not bind to a point mutant of UPRE-Y designated Tv10, the activity of which was less than 1% of UPRE-Y due to a transversion (C to A) at critical nucleotide 10 (11Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The faster migrating band marked by anasterisk may represent a protein(s) recognizing sequences outside of the palindrome. Similarly, binding to UPRE-Y but not to UPRE-Tv10 was obtained with in vitro translated Hac1p (Fig. 2 A), which was demonstrated previously to be a transcription factor responsible for the UPR (10Cox J.S.

Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). When this UPRE-Y (KAR2 UPRE) was inserted into pMCZ2, 56-fold induction of β-galactosidase was observed after treatment of the wild-type cells with tunicamycin at 30 °C for 3 h, whereas pMCZ2 alone caused marginal (2.7-fold) induction (Fig. 3). Thus, β-galactosidase assays with pMCZ2 as well as electrophoretic mobility shift assays using cell extracts and Hac1p translated in vitro allowed us to examine whether promoters of other ER stress-inducible proteins also included a palindromic sequence directly recognized by Hac1p.Figure 3FKB2 UPRE contains a partially palindromic sequence. Nucleotide sequences of KAR2,FKB2, and mutant (FKB2′) UPREs are shown. Partially palindromic sequences between nucleotides 10 and 16 are indicated by arrows. Three nucleotides important forKAR2 UPRE activity at 8, 13, and 18 are marked bydots. Another stretch of important nucleotides (positions 2–4) is double underlined. The wild-type strain (KMY1005) was transformed with pMCZ2 alone (none) or pMCZ2 containing UPRE as indicated. Transformants were grown at 30 °C in SC(−Ura) medium to a mid-log phase, and aliquots were incubated in the presence or absence of tunicamycin (TM). Samples taken after 3 h were used for β-galactosidase assays, and the activities presented are averages of duplicate determinations with three independent transformants. Standard deviation was less than 10% for all values shown. Δ(%) is expressed as a percentage of KAR2 UPRE after subtracting β-galactosidase activities in unstressed cells (−TM) from those in tunicamycin-treated cells (+ TM).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The FKB2 promoter was shown previously to contain a cis-acting element that conferred inducibility by ER stress on the CYC1-lacZ gene (26Partaledis J.A. Berlin V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5450-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We confirmed the observation using the pMCZ2 system; β-galactosidase was induced 10-fold by tunicamycin treatment, although the extent of induction was much lower than that with KAR2 UPRE (Fig. 3). When aligned with KAR2 UPRE, FKB2 UPRE was found to contain a partial palindrome separated by one nucleotide (C), although the 3′ half was not well conserved. However, all three of the nucleotides shown to be important for KAR2 UPRE activity at 8, 13, and 18 (dotted in Fig. 3) were conserved. This FKB2UPRE competed for the specific binding between 32P-labeled UPRE-Y (KAR2 UPRE) and UPRF in cell extracts or Hac1p translated in vitro, albeit less efficiently thanKAR2 UPRE (Fig. 2 B), indicating that induction of Fkb2p by ER stress is mediated, at least in part, by the interaction of Hac1p with this FKB2 UPRE. No other potential UPRE sequences were found in the 263 nucleotides between the translational start site of FKB2 and the termination site of EUG1 known to precede FKB2 (44Goffeau A. Barrell B.G.

https://openalex.org/W2110731034,"In the nematode worm C. elegans, individuals with mutations in the spe-9 gene produce spermatozoa with wild-type morphology and motility that cannot fertilize oocytes even after contact between gametes. Therefore, disruption of spe-9 function affects either gamete recognition, adhesion, signaling, and/or fusion. The spe-9 gene encodes a sperm transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain that contains ten epidermal growth factor–like repeats. A common feature of proteins that include epidermal growth factor–like motifs is their involvement in extracellular functions such as adhesive and ligand–receptor interactions. Additionally, the overall structure of the predicted SPE-9 protein is similar to that of ligands for the Notch/LIN-12/GLP-1 family of transmembrane receptors. These results suggest that SPE-9 functions in the specialized cell–cell interactions required for fertilization."

Previously we have demonstrated that Mts1 protein interacted with the heavy chain of nonmuscle myosin in a calcium-dependent manner. To elucidate the role of the Mts1-myosin interaction, we mapped the Mts1-binding region on the myosin heavy chain molecule. We prepared proteolytically digested platelet myosin and a series of overlapped myosin heavy chain protein fragments and used them in a blot overlay with Mts1 protein. Here we report that the Mts1-binding site is located within a 29-amino acid region, at the C-terminal end of the myosin heavy chain (between 1909–1937 amino acids). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis showed that Mts1 protein inhibits protein kinase C phosphorylation of the platelet myosin heavy chain at Ser-1917. We hypothesize that Mts1 protein regulates cytoskeletal dynamics of the metastatic cells through modulation of the myosin phosphorylation by protein kinase C in calcium-dependent fashion.

The tail domain of the heavy chain contains phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (PKC) and casein kinase II and is involved in the regulation of the filament formation (reviewed in Refs. 28Tan J.L.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). There are two types of MHC isoforms (A and B), which are encoded by two different genes and have cell-type-specific expression (30Katsuragawa Y. Yanagisawa M. Inoue A. Masaki T. Eur. J.

MHC-A is mainly expressed in intestinal epithelium, thymus, spleen, fibroblasts, and macrophages; MHC-B is predominantly expressed in brain and testis.In the present study, we have mapped the region of the MHC-A that interacts with the Mts1 protein. This region is located at the C-terminal end of the MHC rod and contains the site of the phosphorylation by PKC. We report here that in vitro Mts1 protein modulates the phosphorylation of MHC by PKC.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have provided direct evidence that Mts1 protein binds to the heavy chain of nonmuscle myosin in the presence of calcium (22Kriajevska M.V.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1597-1605PubMed Google Scholar). Since the role of this interaction was not clear, it was of interest to identify and characterize the Mts1 binding region of the MHC. For this purpose we used two methods to prepare fragments of MHC. First, platelet myosin was digested by trypsin, and second, we applied RT-PCR to obtain MHC peptides overlapping the whole MHC-A. We demonstrated by blot overlay technique that Mts1 protein interacted with the C terminus of the MHC-A rod in a calcium-dependent manner. Using two series of the recombinant MHC proteins with expanded deletions from C terminus or internal deletions in the C-terminal end of the tail domain, we mapped the Mts1 binding site between the 1909–1937 amino acids of the MHC.Analysis of residues 1909–1937 of the MHC predicted two amphipathic α-helices with a four-residue linker, which contained hydrophobic and basically charged regions (data not shown). The side chain of the hydrophobic residues within the binding site can form extensive contacts with Mts1 hydrophobic patches that are exposed in the presence of calcium and forms a complex in a manner similar to that observed in calmodulin. Calmodulin and some members of the S100 family bind target peptides with similar structural motifs via a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (16Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H.

The influence of the Mts1 binding on the phosphorylation of the platelet myosin by PKC was studied by direct in vitro assay followed by tryptic phosphopeptide analysis. It was found that Mts1 protein inhibited phosphorylation of the MHC at the Ser-1917.The biological role of the PKC phosphorylation of vertebrate nonmuscle MHC is not entirely clear. The PKC phosphorylation site is located close to the non-helical tail region that is involved in MHC filament formation (29Hodge T.P. Cross R. Kendrick-Jones J. J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16046-16055Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the assembly of the MHC was inhibited by the PKC phosphorylation in vitro.This effect was observed when brain MHC-B, but not macrophage MHC-A, was used. In addition, there is an indirect indication that PKC phosphorylation of the MHC may influence disassembly of the myosin filaments in vivo. The stimulation of the PKC activity in the rat basophilic leukemia cells was accompanied by phosphorylation of the myosin heavy and light chains and dissociation of the myosin filaments in the cell cortex (48Ludowyke R.I.

Taken together these data allowed us to suggest that Mts1 protein regulates cell motility via the control of the MHC-A phosphorylation during the myosin assembling/disassembling process. Metastatic progression is a multi-step process starting with genetic alterations in tumor cells. Various genes have been implicated as important determinants of the metastatic phenotype (1Gunthert U.

While a reduction in the level of the Mts1, achieved by using antisense or ribozyme techniques, suppressed the metastatic capability of tumor cells (10Grigorian M.S. Tulchinsky E.M. Zain S.

Recently, mts1 transgenic animals were generated, and it was demonstrated in two different animal models that the presence of the mts1 transgene led to the formation of more invasive primary tumors and the appearance of metastasis (14Ambartsumian N.S.

Jolicoeur P. Barraclough R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1631-1637PubMed Google Scholar). The mts1 gene encodes a 10-kDa calcium-binding protein belonging to the S100 family proteins. These proteins form homodimers and contain two calcium-binding conservative EF-hand domains, which differ by their ability to bind calcium (for reviews, see Refs. 16Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bul. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar and17Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The biological role of S100 proteins including Mts1 is poorly understood. The binding of calcium results in a conformational change within the protein, leading to the exposure of the hydrophobic patches that enable S100 family members to interact with a target proteins and to transmit a biologically important signal (16Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bul. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 17Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). One proposed role of the Mts1 protein in inducing metastatic phenotype is its implication in the regulation of the cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility (13Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakiyama S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 18Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Endo H. Sakiyama S. Jpn. J.

In support of this suggestion, Mts1 was detected in a normal, highly motile cell (8Grigorian M.S. Tulchinsky E.M. Burrone O. Tarabykina S. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E.M. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) where it is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and is partly associated with stress fibers (9Davies B.R. Davies M.P.A. Gibbs F.E.M. Barraclough R. Rudland P.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 999-1008PubMed Google Scholar, 20Watanabe Y. Usada N. Minami H. Morita T. Tsugane S-i. Ishikawa R. Kohama K. Tomida Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19679-19682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, the Mts1 protein was associated with different cytoskeletal proteins such as F-actin and tropomyosin (20Watanabe Y. Usada N. Minami H. Morita T. Tsugane S-i. Ishikawa R. Kohama K. Tomida Y. Hidaka H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,23Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakiyama S. Hasegawa Y. Sato K. Endo H. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 124: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that Mts1 protein interacts with the heavy chain of nonmuscle myosin II in a calcium-dependent fashion (22Kriajevska M.V. Cardenas M.N. Grigorian M.S. Ambartsumian N.S. Georgiev G.P. Lukanidin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19679-19682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ford H.L. Zain S.B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1597-1605PubMed Google Scholar). Nonmuscle myosin II is a chemomechanical protein that participates in cell division, motility, secretion, and capping (for reviews, see Refs.25Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell.

Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This hexameric protein consists of two heavy chains (about 200 kDa) and four lights chains (15–22 kDa). Dimers of heavy chains are folded in stable structures with two globular heads and extended α-helical coiled-coil tails.

Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1987; 3: 379-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The tail domain of the heavy chain contains phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (PKC) and casein kinase II and is involved in the regulation of the filament formation (reviewed in Refs. 28Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar and 29Hodge T.P. Cross R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). There are two types of MHC isoforms (A and B), which are encoded by two different genes and have cell-type-specific expression (30Katsuragawa Y. Yanagisawa M. Inoue A. Masaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 31Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 32Simons M. Wang M. McBride O.W. Kawamoto S. Yamakawa K. Gdula D. Adelstein R.S. Weir L. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). MHC-A is mainly expressed in intestinal epithelium, thymus, spleen, fibroblasts, and macrophages; MHC-B is predominantly expressed in brain and testis. In the present study, we have mapped the region of the MHC-A that interacts with the Mts1 protein. This region is located at the C-terminal end of the MHC rod and contains the site of the phosphorylation by PKC. We report here that in vitro Mts1 protein modulates the phosphorylation of MHC by PKC. DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have provided direct evidence that Mts1 protein binds to the heavy chain of nonmuscle myosin in the presence of calcium (22Kriajevska M.V. Cardenas M.N. Grigorian M.S. Ambartsumian N.S. Georgiev G.P. Lukanidin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19679-19682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ford H.L. Zain S.B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1597-1605PubMed Google Scholar). Since the role of this interaction was not clear, it was of interest to identify and characterize the Mts1 binding region of the MHC. For this purpose we used two methods to prepare fragments of MHC. First, platelet myosin was digested by trypsin, and second, we applied RT-PCR to obtain MHC peptides overlapping the whole MHC-A. We demonstrated by blot overlay technique that Mts1 protein interacted with the C terminus of the MHC-A rod in a calcium-dependent manner. Using two series of the recombinant MHC proteins with expanded deletions from C terminus or internal deletions in the C-terminal end of the tail domain, we mapped the Mts1 binding site between the 1909–1937 amino acids of the MHC.Analysis of residues 1909–1937 of the MHC predicted two amphipathic α-helices with a four-residue linker, which contained hydrophobic and basically charged regions (data not shown). The side chain of the hydrophobic residues within the binding site can form extensive contacts with Mts1 hydrophobic patches that are exposed in the presence of calcium and forms a complex in a manner similar to that observed in calmodulin. Calmodulin and some members of the S100 family bind target peptides with similar structural motifs via a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (16Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H.

PKC phosphorylation of these substrates is inhibited in the presence of interacting proteins such as calmodulin, S100A1, S100B, and S100C (16Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res.

Mts1 protein binds to the region on the MHC molecule that contains Ser-1917, a residue phosphorylated by PKC in vitro and in vivo (39Conti M.A. Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. Elzinga M.

The influence of the Mts1 binding on the phosphorylation of the platelet myosin by PKC was studied by direct in vitro assay followed by tryptic phosphopeptide analysis. It was found that Mts1 protein inhibited phosphorylation of the MHC at the Ser-1917.The biological role of the PKC phosphorylation of vertebrate nonmuscle MHC is not entirely clear. The PKC phosphorylation site is located close to the non-helical tail region that is involved in MHC filament formation (29Hodge T.P. Cross R. Kendrick-Jones J. J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16046-16055Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the assembly of the MHC was inhibited by the PKC phosphorylation in vitro.This effect was observed when brain MHC-B, but not macrophage MHC-A, was used. In addition, there is an indirect indication that PKC phosphorylation of the MHC may influence disassembly of the myosin filaments in vivo. The stimulation of the PKC activity in the rat basophilic leukemia cells was accompanied by phosphorylation of the myosin heavy and light chains and dissociation of the myosin filaments in the cell cortex (48Ludowyke R.I. Peleg I. Beaven M.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12492-12501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Mts1 protein binds to the region on the MHC molecule that contains Ser-1917, a residue phosphorylated by PKC in vitro and in vivo (39Conti M.A. Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. Elzinga M.

The influence of the Mts1 binding on the phosphorylation of the platelet myosin by PKC was studied by direct in vitro assay followed by tryptic phosphopeptide analysis. It was found that Mts1 protein inhibited phosphorylation of the MHC at the Ser-1917. The biological role of the PKC phosphorylation of vertebrate nonmuscle MHC is not entirely clear. The PKC phosphorylation site is located close to the non-helical tail region that is involved in MHC filament formation (29Hodge T.P. Cross R. Kendrick-Jones J. J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16046-16055Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the assembly of the MHC was inhibited by the PKC phosphorylation in vitro.This effect was observed when brain MHC-B, but not macrophage MHC-A, was used. In addition, there is an indirect indication that PKC phosphorylation of the MHC may influence disassembly of the myosin filaments in vivo. The stimulation of the PKC activity in the rat basophilic leukemia cells was accompanied by phosphorylation of the myosin heavy and light chains and dissociation of the myosin filaments in the cell cortex (48Ludowyke R.I. Peleg I. Beaven M.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12492-12501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such reorganization of the myosin filaments could induce changes in cell shape and motility (48Ludowyke R.I. Peleg I. Beaven M.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol.

It was proposed that stress fibers at the periphery of the cell continuously moved to the perinuclear region with disappearance following. Immunofluorescent staining showed that Mts1 protein is co-localized with nonmuscle myosin as an integral part of stress fibers and is concentrated in the perinuclear region (21Takenaga K. Nakamura Y.

To study the mismatch binding properties of the MSH2-MSH6 complex and to examine its functional interaction with the MLH1-PMS1 complex, these protein complexes were purified to near homogeneity from overproducing yeast strains. As has been reported previously, the purified MSH2-MSH6 complex binds DNA substrates containing a G/T mismatch and insertion/deletion mismatches, but the binding affinity for the latter decreases as the size of the extrahelical loop increases. Addition of ATP or the nonhydrolyzable ATPγS reduces binding of the MSH2-MSH6 complex to the DNA substrates markedly. Here, we show that MSH2-MSH6 forms a ternary complex with MLH1-PMS1 on a mismatch containing DNA substrate. The formation of this ternary complex requires ATP, which can be substituted by ATPγS, suggesting that ATP binding alone is sufficient for ternary complex formation. Thus, it appears that ATP binding by the MSH2-MSH6 complex induces a conformation that is conducive for the interaction with MLH1-PMS1 complex, leading to the formation of the ternary complex.

Mismatch repair in yeast and other eukaryotes requires a number of evolutionarily conserved protein factors including threeEscherichia coli MutS homologs, MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6, and two E. coli MutL homologs, MLH1 and PMS1 (1Modrich P.

Genetic studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have indicated that mutations in the MSH2, MLH1, and PMS1 genes result in severe defects in mismatch repair, whereas mutations in the MSH3 or MSH6 genes engender a much smaller mismatch repair defect. From these studies, it has been inferred that MSH2 protein functions in mismatch repair in conjunction with MSH3 or MSH6, and in the absence of the latter two proteins, MSH2 is inactive (4Johnson R.E.

Biochemical studies with yeast and human proteins have clarified the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in the mismatch recognition reaction. MSH2 dimerizes with either MSH3 or MSH6, and the resulting MSH2-MSH3 and MSH2-MSH6 protein complexes have somewhat different mismatch binding specificities. MSH2-MSH6 binds the G/T mismatch and small extrahelical DNA loops preferentially, whereas the MSH2-MSH3 complex shows higher binding affinity for larger extrahelical DNA loops (7Drummond J.T.

Biol. 1996; 6: 1185-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The aforementioned biochemical studies have yielded important information concerning the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 proteins in DNA mismatch recognition. Despite their indispensability in mismatch repair, relatively little is known about the roles of the MLH1 and PMS1 proteins in the repair process. Recently, we overproduced and purified the MLH1-PMS1 complex from a yeast strain genetically tailored to co-overexpress the two proteins (12Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our biochemical studies indicated that whereas MLH1-PMS1 has no affinity for the DNA mismatch, it forms a ternary complex with MSH2-MSH3 on the DNA mismatch and also enhances the ability of the latter to bind the DNA mismatch (12Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The addition of ATP has no effect on the binding of MLH1-PMS1 to MSH2-MSH3 mismatch complex (12Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we examine the interaction between MLH1-PMS1 and MSH2-MSH6 protein complexes with the DNA mismatch. Interestingly, we find that ternary complex formation among these entities requires ATP. The portion of the MSH6 gene encompassing amino acid residues 38 to 612 of the encoded protein was fused to the E. coli transcription terminator rho, and the resulting insoluble rho-MSH6 fusion polypeptide was purified by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (10 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl), and used for raising polyclonal antiserum in rabbits. Antibodies were affinity-purified from the antiserum using a column of cyanogen bromide-Sepharose containing the cross-linked antigen. Antibodies specific for the MSH2, MLH1, and PMS1 proteins were obtained as described (8Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1185-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All the affinity purified antibodies were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and concentrated to 2 mg/ml using Centricon-30 microconcentrator to be used in the supershifting experiment. The MSH2 protein coding sequence from the ATG translation start codon to 259 nucleotides downstream of the TAA stop codon was placed under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL-PGK promoter to yield plasmid pMSH2.1 (2μ, GAL-PGK-MSH2, URA3). The MSH6 gene from the ATG translation start to 1445 bases downstream of the terminator codon was also placed under the control of the GAL-PGK promoter to yield plasmid pMMR10 (2μ, GAL-PGK-MSH6, leu2d). These plasmids were introduced into the protease-deficient yeast strain BJ5464 (MATα, ura3–52, trp1, leu2-Δ1, his3-Δ200, pep4::HIS3, prb1Δ1.6R, can1, GAL). The plasmids pMMR75 (2μ, ADC-MLH1,TRP1) and pMMR97 (2μ, GAL-PGK-PMS1, leu2d), used for the overexpression of the MLH1 and PMS1 proteins, have been described previously (12Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Yeast strain BJ5464 harboring the plasmids pMSH2.1 and pMMR10 was grown overnight in synthetic medium lacking both leucine and uracil and containing 3% glycerol, 2% lactic acid, and 2% sucrose. The overnight culture was diluted to 0.2 A600 in the same medium containing no sucrose and then grown for 16 h. The expression of MSH2 and MSH6 proteins was induced by the addition of 2% galactose to the medium for 7 h. The MSH2-MSH6 complex was purified using a procedure modified from that of Alani (11Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3.4 g of cells were broken in 3 volumes of buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.2 m NaCl using a French press. The extract was clarified by ultracentrifugation (90 min at 100,000 ×g), and the supernatant was loaded onto a PBE- 94 column (1 × 4-cm). The bound proteins were eluted by a 50 ml 0.2–1m NaCl gradient in buffer A. The fractions containing the MSH2-MSH6 complex were diluted 3 times before being loaded onto a single-stranded DNA cellulose column (1 × 1.5-cm; United States Biochemical). The proteins were eluted by a 10-ml 0.2–1 mNaCl gradient in buffer A; the fractions containing the MSH2-MSH6 complex were diluted to bring the conductivity of the pool to an equivalent to 100 mm NaCl before being loaded onto Mono S (HR5/5). The bound proteins were eluted with a 20-ml 0.1–1m NaCl gradient in buffer A. Purified MSH2-MSH6 complex was concentrated in an Amicon-30, divided in small portions, and frozen at −70 °C. The MLH1-PMS1 complex was purified to near homogeneity as reported by Habraken et al. (12Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, 130 g of yeast cells harboring the MLH1 and PMS1 overproducing plasmids were resuspended in phosphate buffer and passed through a French press. The extract was clarified by ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant was fractionated with 0.21 g/ml ammonium sulfate. The precipitated proteins were resuspended, dialyzed, and loaded onto Q-Sepharose. The flow-through fraction from Q-Sepharose was loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column. The proteins eluted from this second chromatography were further purified by passage through hydroxyapatite, Mono S (HR5/5) and Mono Q (HR5/5) as described previously (12Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All of the DNA substrates shared the same bottom strand, which was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fig. 2 A). Because of the shared bottom strand, all of these DNA substrates had the same specific radioactivity (1.2 × 106 cpm/μg). The substrates (5 ng, 6000 cpm) were incubated for 30 min on ice with the indicated amounts of the MSH2-MSH6 and MLH1-PMS1 complexes, and 80 ng of HaeIII-digested φX174 double-stranded DNA added as nonspecific competitor in 10 μl of reaction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol). After the addition of 3 μl of gel loading buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol), the reaction mixtures were run in a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm EDTA. After drying, the gels were exposed to x-ray films and were also subjected to phosphoimage analyses in a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. For the antibody supershifting experiment in Fig. 4, 2 μg of affinity purified antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline were added at the end of the incubation, and the reaction mixtures were kept at 0 °C for 10 min before being subjected to gel electrophoresis.Figure 4Antibody-mediated supershifting of the ternary nucleoprotein complex. MSH2-MSH6 complex, 180 ng (lanes 1–8), was incubated with the G/T substrate with 1 mm ATP in the absence (lane 1–4) or presence (lanes 5–8) of 240 ng of MLH1-PMS1 complex. The reaction mixtures in lanes 2 and 6 were treated with anti-MSH2 antibodies (αMSH2) prior to electrophoresis as indicated; in lanes 3 and 7, anti-PMS1 antibodies (αPMS1) were added, and in lanes 4 and 8, anti-MLH1 antibodies (αMLH1) were added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MSH6 protein exists as a stable complex with the MSH2 protein in both yeast and human (7Drummond J.T.

To purify the MSH2-MSH6 complex for biochemical studies, we fused the MSH2 and MSH6genes to the GAL-PGK promoter to yield plasmids pMSH2.1 (GAL-PGK-MSH2, URA3) and pMMR10 (GAL-PGK-MSH6, leu-2d), respectively. These plasmids were introduced into the protease-deficient yeast strain BJ5464, and the overexpression of MSH2 and MSH6 proteins was verified by immunoblot analyses (Fig. 1 A) using affinity purified antibodies raised against portions of the two MSH proteins expressed in and purified from E. coli (see “Materials and Methods”). For the purification of the MSH2-MSH6 complex, extract from BJ5464 harboring pMSH2.1 and pMMR10 was subjected to chromatographic fractionation in columns of PBE-94, single-stranded DNA cellulose, and Mono S, as described under “Materials and Methods.” When the MSH2-MSH6 complex from the last step of purification in Mono S was analyzed on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue, only the MSH2 and MSH6 protein bands were seen (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the protein preparation was nearly homogeneous. For examining the mismatch binding properties of the purified MSH2-MSH6 complex, we hybridized oligonucleotides to yield duplex substrates (Fig. 2 A) that contained no DNA mismatch (G/C), a G/T mismatch (G/T), and extrahelical loops of 1 base (+1), 2 bases (+2), and 4 bases (+4). These substrates were incubated with the MSH2-MSH6 protein complex, and the reaction mixtures were analyzed on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels run at 4 °C. Nucleoprotein complexes were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gels, and quantification of binding was done by phosphoimage analysis of the gels. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, preferential binding of the MSH2-MSH6 complex to the mismatch containing DNA substrates was seen. However, different levels of nucleoprotein complex formation were observed with the DNA substrates, and the results revealed that the MSH2-MSH6 complex has the highest affinity for the +1 substrate, followed by the G/T, +2, and +4 substrates and that only a trace amount of the homoduplex (G/C) was bound (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, by contrast to the MSH2-MSH3 complex, which has a higher affinity for DNA substrates containing larger extrahelical loops (8Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1185-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Palombo F. Iaccarino I. Nakajima E. Ikejima M. Shimada T. Jiricny J. Curr.

Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the MSH2-MSH6 complex binds less well to DNA containing larger extrahelical loops. With all the mismatched DNA substrates, MSH2-MSH6 forms two nucleoprotein complexes (Fig. 2 B). The reason for these two shifted forms is not known. One rather intriguing aspect concerning the mismatch recognition ability of the MSH2-MSH6 complex is its marked sensitivity to ATP (7Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar,10Iaccarino I. Palombo F. Drummond J. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Modrich P. Jiricny J. Curr.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), which is not seen with the MSH2-MSH3 complex (8Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1185-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For instance, the inclusion of 1 mm ATP to the binding reactions diminishes binding to the G/T and +1 substrates markedly (Fig. 2, D and E). In other experiments, an inhibition of DNA mismatch binding by the MSH2-MSH6 complex was also seen when ATPγS instead of ATP was added to the reaction mixture (see Fig. 3 C). Thus, it appears that the ATP bound form of the MSH2-MSH6 complex has a much lower affinity for DNA mismatch. In addition to MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 proteins, mismatch repair is also dependent on the MLH1 and PMS1 gene products. The MLH1 and PMS1 proteins also exist as a stable stoichiometric complex in yeast cells, and the complex of these proteins has been purified from a yeast strain genetically tailored to co-overexpress the two proteins (12Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the purified MLH1-PMS1 complex used in this study was nearly homogeneous (Fig. 1 B). As reported in our recent work (12Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and reiterated here in Fig. 3 A, no binding of MLH1-PMS1 protein complex to the homoduplex or to any of mismatch-containing DNA substrates (G/T, +1, +2, and +4) was evident. At much higher concentrations of MLH1-PMS1 than those used in the experiments reported here, a low level of nonspecific binding to all of the DNA substrates occurs, but under no circumstances have we detected preferential binding to the DNA mismatch. Taken together, these results indicate that the MLH1-PMS1 complex has no mismatch recognition ability. We showed recently that the MLH1-PMS1 complex enhances the mismatch binding ability of the MSH2-MSH3 complex and forms a ternary complex with the latter on the DNA mismatch (12Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because of this result, it was of considerable interest to examine the effect of the purified MLH1-PMS1 complex on the mismatch binding ability of the MSH2-MSH6 complex, and whether a ternary complex between these two protein complexes is formed on the DNA mismatch. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the addition of amounts of MLH1-PMS1 complex stoichiometric to that of MSH2-MSH6 complex had no significant effect on the mismatch binding ability of the latter protein complex. In Fig. 3 A, the +1 substrate was used for testing the effect of the MLH1-PMS1 complex. We have also used the G/T substrate and found no significant effect of the MLH1-PMS1 complex on the binding of this DNA mismatch substrate by MSH2-MSH6 or any evidence of the formation of a ternary complex between the DNA mismatch and MLH1-PMS1 and MSH2-MSH6 protein complexes. The results in Fig. 3 A produced no evidence for a functional or physical interaction between the MSH2-MSH6 complex and the MLH1-PMS1 complex, which was a somewhat surprising result, given that genetic and biochemical studies have indicated that MSH2-MSH6-dependent mismatch repair also requires the MLH1-PMS1 complex, and that the latter has been found to interact with the other mismatch recognition protein complex, MSH2-MSH3, in the presence of a DNA mismatch forming a ternary complex (12Habraken Y.

Since ATP binding apparently induces a substantial conformational change in MSH2-MSH6 as indicated by a highly reproducible reduction in the binding of DNA mismatches (Fig. 2,D and E), we reasoned that perhaps this ATP-induced conformational change in the MSH2-MSH6 complex is also a prerequisite for interaction with the MLH1-PMS1 complex. To test this idea directly, we repeated the mismatch binding experiment with both the MLH1-PMS1 and MSH2-MSH6 protein complexes and the G/T and +1 substrates, but in the presence of 1 mm ATP (Fig. 3 B), which as shown previously (Fig. 2, D and E) effects a large reduction in the binding of the MSH2-MSH6 complex to these DNA. Interestingly, a novel nucleoprotein complex (designated by C*) which migrates above the normal MSH2-MSH6-mismatch nucleoprotein complex (designated by C) was formed with both the G/T and +1 substrates in the presence of ATP. To determine if ATP binding alone was sufficient or if ATP hydrolysis was also required for ternary complex formation, we examined whether the novel nucleoprotein complex was formed in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues ATPγS and AMP-PNP 1The abbreviation used is: AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino) triphosphate. (Fig. 3 C). As has been reported previously for the human MSH2-MSH6 complex (7Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), addition of AMP-PNP did not reduce the mismatch binding ability of the yeast MSH2-MSH6 complex (Fig. 3 C, lane 6). AMP-PNP also did not promote the formation of a ternary complex of MSH2-MSH6 with MLH1-PMS1 on mismatched DNA (Fig. 3 C, lane 12). The lack of any effect of AMP-PNP may result from the inability of MSH2-MSH6 to bind this nucleotide, or binding to this nucleotide may not alter the conformation of MSH2-MSH6 to a form appropriate for interaction with MLH1-PMS1. As shown in Fig. 3 C, ATPγS, however, induced the formation of the novel nucleoprotein complex, albeit at a somewhat lower efficiency than ATP, suggesting that binding of ATP by MSH2-MSH6 is sufficient to promote ternary complex formation. In a recent study (13Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the human MSH2-MSH6 complex cycles between ADP and ATP bound forms. According to these workers, the ADP bound form of human MSH2-MSH6 binds the DNA mismatch and serves as a nucleation point for the assembly of other mismatch repair proteins. Turnover of the human MSH2-MSH6 complex from the mismatch is triggered upon the exchange of ADP to ATP by the protein complex. Our results with the yeast MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer, however, have indicated that ADP does not induce the formation of a ternary complex of MSH2-MSH6 with MLH1-PMS1 on mismatched DNA. Similar to the effect of AMP-PNP (Fig. 3 C), addition of 1 mmADP had no effect on the mismatch (G/T) binding ability of the MSH2-MSH6 complex, and it did not promote the formation of the ternary nucleoprotein complex (data not shown). Thus, our observations in yeast indicate the involvement of the ATP bound form of MSH2-MSH6 in mismatch repair. The availability of antibodies against the various mismatch repair proteins has allowed us to directly test for the presence of the MLH1 and PMS1 proteins in the ternary complex by antibody-mediated supershifting. As shown in Fig. 4, treatment of the ternary nucleoprotein complex with either affinity purified anti-MLH1 or anti-PMS1 antibodies resulted in a retarded mobility of this complex, whereas treatment of the binary nucleoprotein complex formed between MSH2-MSH6 and the DNA mismatch with these antibodies had no effect on its gel mobility. As expected, treatment of the ternary complex with anti-MSH2 antibodies also resulted in retarded mobility of the nucleoprotein complex. In the absence of ATP, no evidence of ternary complex formation was seen, as evidenced by the lack of supershifting by the anti-PMS1 or anti-MLH1 antibodies of the DNA mismatch bound MSH2-MSH6 complex that had been incubated with the MLH1-PMS1 complex (data not shown). Taken together, our results indicate that ATP binding promotes the formation of a ternary complex of MLH1-PMS1 with mismatch bound MSH2-MSH6. We have purified the MSH2-MSH6 protein complex from yeast and carried out biochemical studies to examine the mismatch binding properties of the MSH2-MSH6 complex and explore the functional and physical interactions of this complex with the MLH1-PMS1 protein complex. As has been reported previously (7Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 10Iaccarino I. Palombo F. Drummond J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the MSH2-MSH6 complex binds with higher affinity to DNA substrates that contain a single-base mismatch and small extrahelical loops than to those that contain larger loops. The mismatch binding preference of the MSH2-MSH6 complex differs from that of the MSH2-MSH3 complex, which has higher avidity for substrates with larger extrahelical loops (8Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1185-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Palombo F. Iaccarino I. Nakajima E. Ikejima M. Shimada T. Jiricny J. Curr.

The mismatch binding activity of the MSH2-MSH6 protein complex is highly sensitive to ATP or the nonhydrolyzable analogue ATPγS, suggesting that nucleotide binding induces a marked conformational change in the MSH2-MSH6 complex. One interpretation of these results is that ATP binding by the mismatch bound MSH2-MSH6 complex effects the release of the protein complex from the DNA mismatch. Given that we saw no evidence of ternary complex formation among MSH2-MSH6, MLH1-PMS1, and the DNA mismatch in the absence of ATP, we considered the possibility that the ATP-induced conformational change in the MSH2-MSH6 protein complex may be a prerequisite for the interaction of the former with the MLH1-PMS1 protein complex. Indeed, the addition of ATP promotes the formation of a ternary complex of MLH1-PMS1, MSH2-MSH6, and the DNA mismatch. We have also shown that ATPγS can effectively substitute for ATP, suggesting that nucleotide binding by MSH2-MSH6 is sufficient for ternary complex formation. In its dependence upon ATP for ternary complex formation, the MSH2-MSH6 complex resembles the E. coli MutS protein, where the binding of the MutSmismatch complex to MutL also requires ATP binding but not its hydrolysis (14Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, the MLH1-PMS1 complex combines with either the MSH2-MSH3 complex (12Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or the MSH2-MSH6 complex (this work) and the DNA mismatch to form a ternary complex. In the case of MSH2-MSH3, ternary complex formation is not dependent on ATP (12Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas with MSH2-MSH6, ATP binding is required for the assembly of the ternary complex (this work). We suggest that the ternary complexes consisting of MLH1-PMS1 and either MSH2-MSH3 or MSH2-MSH6 would be critical for the recruitment of other components indispensable for mismatch repair including the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (15Umar A.

TGF-β has been implicated in diverse phenomena including growth control, production of extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and motility, and modulation of cell phenotype (1Lyons R.M. Moses H.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). As such, TGF-β has broad influence over normal growth and developmental programs and over the pathologic sequelae that arise from their dysfunction. TGF-β communicates with the cytoplasm through a heteromeric complex composed of type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII) transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. Upon ligand binding, TβRII transphosphorylates TβRI in a highly conserved GS domain, thereby activating TβRI kinase activity toward downstream effectors. Ligand binding specificity is conferred by TβRII, whereas signal specificity is conferred by TβRI (2Massagué J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar).Several studies have focused on the nature of the signal transduction machinery downstream of the TGF-β receptor complex. Genetic approaches in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, along with supporting biochemical evidence in Xenopus laevis and mammalian systems have implicated the Smad family of proteins in signaling by TGF-β superfamily members. Evidence suggests that the Smads, through ligand-dependent phosphorylation and hetero-oligomerization, play crucial roles in growth and transcriptional regulation by TGF-β (3Massagué J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Other putative downstream effectors in TGF-β signaling include FKBP12 (4Wang T. Li B.-Y.

Nature. 1995; 377: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), each identified through their specific interactions with TGF-β receptors. However, despite extensive investigation, a clearly defined picture of the post-receptor signaling machinery for TGF-β remains elusive.Rho proteins, monomeric GTPases of the Ras superfamily (7Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar), serve as molecular switches that cycle between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) states. Rho proteins undergo a complex series of post-translational modifications initiated by isoprenylation of a C-terminal CAAX motif (8Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Generally, Rho proteins are geranylgeranylated, although RhoB can be modified by either a geranylgeranyl or a farnesyl moiety (9Lebowitz P.F. Casey P.J. Prendergast G.C. Thissen J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15591-15594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In most cases, Rho protein function requires isoprenylation (8Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 10Lebowitz P.F. Du W. Prendergast G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16093-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Rho proteins regulate specific actin cytoskeletal structures, including stress fibers (RhoA/C), lamellipodia (Rac1), and filopodia (Cdc42), and make manifest the effects of growth factors and oncogenes on cell morphology (11Ridley A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Additionally, Rho family members have been implicated in cell growth control as regulators of the G1/S transition and in transformation, both alone and in cooperation with oncogenic Ras (12Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 13Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J.

Recent evidence also suggests that Rho proteins, as regulators of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) signaling module, are components of the intracellular relay for transcriptional activation signals that originate from the TGF-β receptor complex (15Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar).RhoB, whose primary structure is 88% identical to the Rho family prototype RhoA, has several distinguishing features. Most notably, RhoB is inducible by a variety of stimuli, including the growth factors epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, genotoxic stresses from UV light and alkylating xenobiotics, and activated tyrosine kinases such as v-Src and v-Fps (16Jähner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17De Cremoux P. Gauville C. Closson V. Linares G. Calvo F. Tavitian A. Olofsson B. Int. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Unlike other Rho family members, both RhoB mRNA and protein are labile, with half-lives of approximately 20 min and 2 h, respectively (18Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Additionally, RhoB is subject to post-translational palmitoylation as a secondary membrane localization signal following isoprenylation (20Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tillbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This contrasts with other Rho proteins, for whom this role is presumably accomplished by an intrinsic polybasic domain immediately proximal to the CAAX motif. Because of a high degree of homology, it has been hypothesized that RhoB and RhoA have similar biological activities. Both proteins promote transactivation of the serum response element of the c-fos promoter (10Lebowitz P.F. Du W. Prendergast G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16093-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Hill C.S. Treismann R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Also, both RhoB and RhoA can potentiate the transforming activity of oncogenic Ras (13Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar, 14Qui R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, RhoB and RhoA are localized differently in mammalian cells. Furthermore, although RhoA subcellular localization is altered in response to lysophosphatidic acid, localization of RhoB is unaffected (22Flemming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33067-33073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In conjunction with differences in protein stability, post-translational modifications, and inducibility by exogenous stimuli, the physiologic functions of RhoB and RhoA appear at least partially distinct.Because of its inducibility and the previously described effects of Rho family members on TGF-β signal transduction, we explored the influence of TGF-β on RhoB and the subsequent influence of RhoB on TGF-β-mediated gene expression. We demonstrate that RhoB turnover occurs via ubiquitin-mediated destruction by the 26 S proteasome and that TGF-β exerts a stabilizing influence toward RhoB, thereby permitting its accumulation. Unlike other stimuli that induce RhoB gene transcription, TGF-β-mediated accumulation of RhoB does not correlate with changes in RhoB mRNA levels. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of the TGF-β-responsive reporter p3TP-Lux is antagonized by wild type RhoB in a dose-dependent manner but is not affected by its dominant inhibitory point mutant, RhoB-N19. These data suggest that TGF-β can regulate the abundance of some cytoplasmic effectors by controlling their destruction. Additionally, these data suggest that cells enlist multiple Rho proteins to coordinate transcriptional activation signals initiated by TGF-β.DISCUSSIONThe signal transduction machinery downstream of the TGF-β receptor complex has been the focus of intense investigation. Considerable evidence suggests that Smad proteins are essential regulators of TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition and transcriptional activation (3Massagué J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, recent data also suggest a critical role for Rho proteins in TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation (15Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). GTPase deficient, constitutively active mutants of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs can transactivate the TGF-β-responsive reporter p3TP-Lux in the absence of ligand. Additionally, Rac1 and to a lesser extent RhoA can potentiate the positive influence of TGF-β on the same reporter. Dominant negative derivatives of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42Hs individually antagonized but collectively abolished TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation. Furthermore, dominant negative versions of MEKK1, MKK4, SAPK/JNK, and c-Jun, components of the SAPK/JNK pathway, each abolished the positive influences of constitutively active Rho proteins on p3TP-Lux transactivation. In concert, these results suggest that TGF-β responsiveness may require the cooperation of the Rho/SAPK/JNK and Smad signal transduction cascades.RhoB, like other members of the Ras superfamily, acts as a binary switch that cycles between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) states. RhoB expression can be induced by a variety of stimuli, and evidence suggests that both RhoB mRNA and RhoB protein are labile, with half-lives of approximately 20 min and 2 h, respectively (18Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,19Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The inducibility and lability of RhoB, in conjunction with its post-translational modifications and its regulation by a bound guanine nucleotide, permit control of its function at several levels and as such present unique regulatory opportunities. We demonstrate that TGF-β promotes the accumulation of isoprenylated RhoB by antagonizing its destruction. Interestingly, accumulation of RhoB in its isoprenylated form may reflect a connection between TGF-β signaling and protein prenylation, suggested from the observed interaction of farnesyltransferase-α and the TGF-β type I receptor (5Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazona K. Engel M.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29628-29631Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The ability of TGF-β to regulate prenyltransferase activity toward RhoB is currently being explored. In contrast to other stimuli, we see no correlation between TGF-β stimulation and the abundance of RhoB mRNA. Although this cannot be eliminated as a contributing factor, our data suggest that regulated RhoB turnover is primarily responsible for TGF-β-induced RhoB accumulation. By extension, regulated protein stability might reflect a more general mechanism by which TGF-β controls the activities of its downstream effectors to produce its diverse biological responses.A small fraction of total cellular protein undergoes rapid turnover. Frequently these proteins are components of regulatory pathways. Their limited life span, in concert with other control mechanisms, provides restrictions on their biological influence. By extension, controlling the turnover rate of regulatory proteins, thereby influencing their steady-state levels, could dramatically affect signal transduction via the pathways in which these proteins participate. Several examples of controlled proteolysis as a means for regulating protein function have been described (29Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 30: 405-439Crossref Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). The majority of selective protein turnover in eukaryotic cells is achieved by obligatory conjugation between lysine residues of the target protein and the C terminus of ubiquitin. Sequential ubiquitin additions yield multiubiquitin chains that direct the target protein for destruction by the 26 S proteasome (29Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 30: 405-439Crossref Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). We show that RhoB protein is conjugated to ubiquitin in Mv1Lu cells and that ubiquitinated RhoB is subsequently eliminated by the 26 S proteasome. The participation of the 26 S proteasome and the coincident influence of TGF-β on RhoB stability suggests that TGF-β may regulate a component of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic machinery.The reporter p3TP-Lux is frequently used as a measure of TGF-β responsiveness in mammalian cells. To explore the influence of RhoB on TGF-β signaling, we examined the impact of its expression or that of its dominant-negative mutant, RhoB-N19, on p3TP-Lux transactivation. In either Mv1Lu cells or R1B(L17) cells rendered TGF-β-responsive by TβRI cotransfection, wild type RhoB antagonized p3TP-Lux activation by TGF-β. RhoB-N19 failed to attenuate and instead perhaps potentiated p3TP-Lux activity in these cells, consistent with dominant interference with endogenous RhoB function. These data suggest that RhoB exerts negative regulatory influence on TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation. Functionally distinct negative regulation of TGF-β signaling has also been described for FKBP12, Smad6, and Smad7 and correlated with binding to TβRI. In light of the potentiating influence of other Rho family members toward p3TP-Lux transactivation and the labile nature of RhoB, it is attractive to speculate that RhoB accumulation in response to TGF-β imposes negative but inherently self-limited restriction on the Rho-mediated aspects of TGF-β signal transduction.

TGF-β has been implicated in diverse phenomena including growth control, production of extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and motility, and modulation of cell phenotype (1Lyons R.M. Moses H.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). As such, TGF-β has broad influence over normal growth and developmental programs and over the pathologic sequelae that arise from their dysfunction. TGF-β communicates with the cytoplasm through a heteromeric complex composed of type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII) transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. Upon ligand binding, TβRII transphosphorylates TβRI in a highly conserved GS domain, thereby activating TβRI kinase activity toward downstream effectors. Ligand binding specificity is conferred by TβRII, whereas signal specificity is conferred by TβRI (2Massagué J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Several studies have focused on the nature of the signal transduction machinery downstream of the TGF-β receptor complex. Genetic approaches in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, along with supporting biochemical evidence in Xenopus laevis and mammalian systems have implicated the Smad family of proteins in signaling by TGF-β superfamily members. Evidence suggests that the Smads, through ligand-dependent phosphorylation and hetero-oligomerization, play crucial roles in growth and transcriptional regulation by TGF-β (3Massagué J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Other putative downstream effectors in TGF-β signaling include FKBP12 (4Wang T. Li B.-Y.

Cell. 1996; 86: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), farnesyltransferase-α (5Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazona K. Engel M.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29628-29631Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and TRIP-1 (6Chen R.-H. Miettinen P.J. Maruoka E.M. Choy L. Derynck R. Nature. 1995; 377: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), each identified through their specific interactions with TGF-β receptors. However, despite extensive investigation, a clearly defined picture of the post-receptor signaling machinery for TGF-β remains elusive. Rho proteins, monomeric GTPases of the Ras superfamily (7Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar), serve as molecular switches that cycle between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) states. Rho proteins undergo a complex series of post-translational modifications initiated by isoprenylation of a C-terminal CAAX motif (8Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Generally, Rho proteins are geranylgeranylated, although RhoB can be modified by either a geranylgeranyl or a farnesyl moiety (9Lebowitz P.F. Casey P.J. Prendergast G.C. Thissen J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15591-15594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In most cases, Rho protein function requires isoprenylation (8Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 10Lebowitz P.F. Du W. Prendergast G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16093-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Rho proteins regulate specific actin cytoskeletal structures, including stress fibers (RhoA/C), lamellipodia (Rac1), and filopodia (Cdc42), and make manifest the effects of growth factors and oncogenes on cell morphology (11Ridley A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Additionally, Rho family members have been implicated in cell growth control as regulators of the G1/S transition and in transformation, both alone and in cooperation with oncogenic Ras (12Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 13Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J.

Recent evidence also suggests that Rho proteins, as regulators of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) signaling module, are components of the intracellular relay for transcriptional activation signals that originate from the TGF-β receptor complex (15Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). RhoB, whose primary structure is 88% identical to the Rho family prototype RhoA, has several distinguishing features. Most notably, RhoB is inducible by a variety of stimuli, including the growth factors epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, genotoxic stresses from UV light and alkylating xenobiotics, and activated tyrosine kinases such as v-Src and v-Fps (16Jähner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17De Cremoux P. Gauville C. Closson V. Linares G. Calvo F. Tavitian A. Olofsson B. Int. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Unlike other Rho family members, both RhoB mRNA and protein are labile, with half-lives of approximately 20 min and 2 h, respectively (18Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Additionally, RhoB is subject to post-translational palmitoylation as a secondary membrane localization signal following isoprenylation (20Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tillbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This contrasts with other Rho proteins, for whom this role is presumably accomplished by an intrinsic polybasic domain immediately proximal to the CAAX motif. Because of a high degree of homology, it has been hypothesized that RhoB and RhoA have similar biological activities. Both proteins promote transactivation of the serum response element of the c-fos promoter (10Lebowitz P.F. Du W. Prendergast G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16093-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Hill C.S. Treismann R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Also, both RhoB and RhoA can potentiate the transforming activity of oncogenic Ras (13Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar, 14Qui R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, RhoB and RhoA are localized differently in mammalian cells. Furthermore, although RhoA subcellular localization is altered in response to lysophosphatidic acid, localization of RhoB is unaffected (22Flemming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33067-33073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In conjunction with differences in protein stability, post-translational modifications, and inducibility by exogenous stimuli, the physiologic functions of RhoB and RhoA appear at least partially distinct. Because of its inducibility and the previously described effects of Rho family members on TGF-β signal transduction, we explored the influence of TGF-β on RhoB and the subsequent influence of RhoB on TGF-β-mediated gene expression. We demonstrate that RhoB turnover occurs via ubiquitin-mediated destruction by the 26 S proteasome and that TGF-β exerts a stabilizing influence toward RhoB, thereby permitting its accumulation. Unlike other stimuli that induce RhoB gene transcription, TGF-β-mediated accumulation of RhoB does not correlate with changes in RhoB mRNA levels. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of the TGF-β-responsive reporter p3TP-Lux is antagonized by wild type RhoB in a dose-dependent manner but is not affected by its dominant inhibitory point mutant, RhoB-N19. These data suggest that TGF-β can regulate the abundance of some cytoplasmic effectors by controlling their destruction. Additionally, these data suggest that cells enlist multiple Rho proteins to coordinate transcriptional activation signals initiated by TGF-β. DISCUSSIONThe signal transduction machinery downstream of the TGF-β receptor complex has been the focus of intense investigation. Considerable evidence suggests that Smad proteins are essential regulators of TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition and transcriptional activation (3Massagué J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, recent data also suggest a critical role for Rho proteins in TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation (15Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). GTPase deficient, constitutively active mutants of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs can transactivate the TGF-β-responsive reporter p3TP-Lux in the absence of ligand. Additionally, Rac1 and to a lesser extent RhoA can potentiate the positive influence of TGF-β on the same reporter. Dominant negative derivatives of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42Hs individually antagonized but collectively abolished TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation. Furthermore, dominant negative versions of MEKK1, MKK4, SAPK/JNK, and c-Jun, components of the SAPK/JNK pathway, each abolished the positive influences of constitutively active Rho proteins on p3TP-Lux transactivation. In concert, these results suggest that TGF-β responsiveness may require the cooperation of the Rho/SAPK/JNK and Smad signal transduction cascades.RhoB, like other members of the Ras superfamily, acts as a binary switch that cycles between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) states. RhoB expression can be induced by a variety of stimuli, and evidence suggests that both RhoB mRNA and RhoB protein are labile, with half-lives of approximately 20 min and 2 h, respectively (18Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,19Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The inducibility and lability of RhoB, in conjunction with its post-translational modifications and its regulation by a bound guanine nucleotide, permit control of its function at several levels and as such present unique regulatory opportunities. We demonstrate that TGF-β promotes the accumulation of isoprenylated RhoB by antagonizing its destruction. Interestingly, accumulation of RhoB in its isoprenylated form may reflect a connection between TGF-β signaling and protein prenylation, suggested from the observed interaction of farnesyltransferase-α and the TGF-β type I receptor (5Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazona K. Engel M.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29628-29631Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The ability of TGF-β to regulate prenyltransferase activity toward RhoB is currently being explored. In contrast to other stimuli, we see no correlation between TGF-β stimulation and the abundance of RhoB mRNA. Although this cannot be eliminated as a contributing factor, our data suggest that regulated RhoB turnover is primarily responsible for TGF-β-induced RhoB accumulation. By extension, regulated protein stability might reflect a more general mechanism by which TGF-β controls the activities of its downstream effectors to produce its diverse biological responses.A small fraction of total cellular protein undergoes rapid turnover. Frequently these proteins are components of regulatory pathways. Their limited life span, in concert with other control mechanisms, provides restrictions on their biological influence. By extension, controlling the turnover rate of regulatory proteins, thereby influencing their steady-state levels, could dramatically affect signal transduction via the pathways in which these proteins participate. Several examples of controlled proteolysis as a means for regulating protein function have been described (29Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 30: 405-439Crossref Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). The majority of selective protein turnover in eukaryotic cells is achieved by obligatory conjugation between lysine residues of the target protein and the C terminus of ubiquitin. Sequential ubiquitin additions yield multiubiquitin chains that direct the target protein for destruction by the 26 S proteasome (29Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 30: 405-439Crossref Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). We show that RhoB protein is conjugated to ubiquitin in Mv1Lu cells and that ubiquitinated RhoB is subsequently eliminated by the 26 S proteasome. The participation of the 26 S proteasome and the coincident influence of TGF-β on RhoB stability suggests that TGF-β may regulate a component of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic machinery.The reporter p3TP-Lux is frequently used as a measure of TGF-β responsiveness in mammalian cells. To explore the influence of RhoB on TGF-β signaling, we examined the impact of its expression or that of its dominant-negative mutant, RhoB-N19, on p3TP-Lux transactivation. In either Mv1Lu cells or R1B(L17) cells rendered TGF-β-responsive by TβRI cotransfection, wild type RhoB antagonized p3TP-Lux activation by TGF-β. RhoB-N19 failed to attenuate and instead perhaps potentiated p3TP-Lux activity in these cells, consistent with dominant interference with endogenous RhoB function. These data suggest that RhoB exerts negative regulatory influence on TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation. Functionally distinct negative regulation of TGF-β signaling has also been described for FKBP12, Smad6, and Smad7 and correlated with binding to TβRI. In light of the potentiating influence of other Rho family members toward p3TP-Lux transactivation and the labile nature of RhoB, it is attractive to speculate that RhoB accumulation in response to TGF-β imposes negative but inherently self-limited restriction on the Rho-mediated aspects of TGF-β signal transduction. The signal transduction machinery downstream of the TGF-β receptor complex has been the focus of intense investigation. Considerable evidence suggests that Smad proteins are essential regulators of TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition and transcriptional activation (3Massagué J. Hata A. Liu F.

https://openalex.org/W2084469870,"We have previously demonstrated that annexin IV, one of the calcium/phospholipid-binding annexin family proteins, binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in a calcium-dependent manner (Kojima, K., Yamamoto, K., Irimura, T., Osawa, T., Ogawa, H., and Matsumoto, I. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 7679–7685). In this study, we investigated the GAG binding specificities of annexins IV, V, and VI by affinity chromatography and solid phase assays. Annexin IV was found to bind in a calcium-dependent manner to all the GAG columns tested. Annexin V bound to heparin and heparan sulfate columns but not to chondroitin sulfate columns. Annexin VI was adsorbed to heparin and heparan sulfate columns in a calcium-independent manner, and to chondroitin sulfate columns in a calcium-dependent manner. An N-terminal half fragment (A6NH) and a C-terminal half fragment (A6CH) of annexin VI, each containing four units, were prepared by digestion with V8 protease and examined for GAG binding activities. A6NH bound to heparin in the presence of calcium but not to chondroitin sulfate C, whereas A6CH bound to heparin calcium-independently and to chondroitin sulfate C calcium-dependently. The results showed that annexin IV, V, and VI have different GAG binding properties. Some annexins have been reported to be detected not only in the cytoplasm but also on the cell surface or in extracellular components. The findings suggest that the some annexins function as recognition elements for GAGs in extracellular space. We have previously demonstrated that annexin IV, one of the calcium/phospholipid-binding annexin family proteins, binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in a calcium-dependent manner (Kojima, K., Yamamoto, K., Irimura, T., Osawa, T., Ogawa, H., and Matsumoto, I.

Annexin IV was found to bind in a calcium-dependent manner to all the GAG columns tested. Annexin V bound to heparin and heparan sulfate columns but not to chondroitin sulfate columns.

Some annexins have been reported to be detected not only in the cytoplasm but also on the cell surface or in extracellular components. The findings suggest that the some annexins function as recognition elements for GAGs in extracellular space. Annexins are a family of about 13 structurally related calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins. They consist of four or eight conserved repeating structures of approximately 70 amino acid residues and with an N-terminal domain that is highly variable in both sequence and length, which distinguishes different family members. The N-terminal domain is thought to confer functional diversity, whereas this family's common calcium and phospholipid binding activities probably reside in each repeating unit. Several functions proposed for annexins based on their membrane and calcium binding activities include inhibition of phospholipase A2 and blood coagulation, regulation of membrane traffic and exocytosis, binding to cytoskeletal proteins, transmembrane channel activity, and intracellular signaling as a kinase substrate (1Raynal P.

However, the complete range of their physiological functions has not been elucidated. We have previously purified a calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding protein, p33/41, from bovine kidney by two-step affinity chromatography on heparin and fetuin columns (4Kojima K. Ogawa H.K.

Proteoglycans (macromolecules consisting of a protein core and GAG side chains, which are found in the extracellular matrix, on the cell surface, and in secretory granules) are involved in a broad range of activities. Some of their functions are likely to depend on the direct interactions between GAGs and the other molecules (11Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 13Iozzo R.V.

In this study, we investigated the GAG binding activities of annexin IV, V, and VI and their binding specificities to GAGs. Bovine brain and liver were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and used fresh or stored at −80 °C. Heparin (porcine intestinal mucosa) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Heparan sulfate was prepared from porcine kidney in our laboratory (14Akiyama F. Seno N. Natl. Sci. Rep. Ochanomizu Univ. Tokyo. 1978; 29: 147-153Google Scholar). Other GAGs (chondroitin, chondroitin sulfate A (whale cartilage, super-special grade), chondroitin sulfate C (shark cartilage, super-special grade), and dermatan sulfate (porcine skin, super-special grade)) were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). Desulfated heparin was prepared by solvolysis of heparin according to Inoue (15Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 46: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and Ogamo (16Ogamo A.

Proteases, endoproteinase Lys-C (Lysobacter enzymogenes, sequencing grade), and V8 protease were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to annexin IV, V, and VI were prepared in our laboratory (20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody was purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Bovine annexin IV and V cDNA were inserted into plasmid pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), and recombinant proteins were produced as GST fusion proteins as described previously (6Kojima K.

Annexin V was purified from bovine brain extract. Bovine brain was homogenized in 4.5 volumes (v/w) of 2 mm EDTA in MTBS (150 mm NaCl, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The homogenate was shaken for 30 min and centrifuged at 40,000 ×g for 30 min. CaCl2 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 7 mm. After 15 min on ice, the fraction was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was washed twice with 5 mm CaCl2-MTBS. The pellet was then resuspended in 2 mm EDTA-MTBS and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The final supernatant was applied to a heparin column which had been equilibrated with 2 mm EDTA-MTBS, and the flow-through fraction was recovered; CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm excess. After 30 min on ice, it was applied to another heparin column equilibrated with 5 mmCaCl2-MTBS. After the column had been washed with 5 mm CaCl2-MTBS, proteins bound to the column were eluted with 2 mm EDTA-MTBS. The two forms of annexin V were separated from one another by anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), according to Donato et al.(21Donato R. Giambanco I. Pula G. Bianchi R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein fractions were desalted, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and applied to a column of DEAE (TSK DEAE 5pw, inner diameter 7.5 × 0.75 cm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (0–1 m). Annexin VI was purified from bovine liver extract by the method of Creutz et al. (22Creutz C.E. Zaks W.J. Hamman H.C. Crane S. Martin W.H. Gould K.L. Oddie K.M. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1860-1868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. 150 mg of bovine liver was homogenized in 400 ml of buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3). After the homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, the pellet fraction was discarded, and CaCl2 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 7 mm. The extract was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet fraction resuspended in 200 ml of buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3). This fraction was then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min, resuspended in 200 ml of buffer B, and centrifuged again at 27,000 × g for 30 min to complete the washing of the particulate fraction in Ca2+-containing buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in 60 ml of buffer A and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant containing the proteins extracted in EGTA was applied directly to a 1.6 × 20-cm column of phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A. Ammonium sulfate was added to the flow-through fractions (66%) to concentrate the proteins by precipitation. The protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 45 min, resuspended in 5 ml of 0.3 m sucrose, 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, and then desalted by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer. The protein fraction was then applied to a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated in the same buffer, and adsorbed proteins were eluted with a salt gradient formed by mixing with 1 m KCl, 0.3m sucrose, 25 mm HEPES-NaCl, pH 7.3. In the final purification step, the fraction eluted with 240 mmKCl from a DEAE-cellulose column was applied to a heparin-Sepharose 4B column (inner diameter 0.8 × 6 cm) equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The column was washed with the equilibration buffer, and the adsorbed protein was eluted with 2 mm EDTA and 300 mm NaCl by stepwise elution. Annexin VI was digested with V8 protease at a ratio of 5:1 (w/w) for 1.5 h at 37 °C in 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (23Hazarika P. Sheldon A. Kaetzel M.A. Diaz-Monoz M. Hamilton S.L. Dedman J.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 46: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The size of the fragments obtained was determined by gel filtration HPLC using a Shodex Protein KW-803 column (inner diameter 0.8 × 6 cm; Showa Denko, Tokyo, Japan). One-dimensional SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). The electrophoresed proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and then probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies, and the bound antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody and 4-chloro-1-naphthol. Annexin V and VI were digested with proteinases, and peptide fragments produced were purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a C18 column (Waters, Burlington, MA) or were subjected to SDS-PAGE and successive electroblotting onto a PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane containing peptide fragments was cut into small pieces for direct sequencing. Amino acid sequencing was performed with a pulse-liquid protein sequencer 476A (Applied Biosystems Japan, Tokyo, Japan). All GAG-Sepharose gels were prepared by the methods described previously (18Matsumoto I. Seno N. Golovtchenko-Matsumoto A.M. Osawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 85: 1091-1098Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Kitagaki-Ogawa H. Yathogo T Izumi M. Hayashi M Kashiwagi H. Matsumoto I. Seno N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1033: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 100 mg of GAG was incubated with 5 g of amino-Sepharose and 100 mg ofN-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline/5 ml of 40% (v/v) ethanol at 40 °C overnight. Then the gel was acetylated to block the remaining amino groups. The amounts of immobilized GAGs were calculated from the hexosamine values of each GAG reported previously (14Akiyama F. Seno N. Natl. Sci. Rep. Ochanomizu Univ. Tokyo. 1978; 29: 147-153Google Scholar, 16Ogamo A. Metori A. Uchiyama H. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr. Res. 1989; 193: 165-172Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and from actual hexosamine contents of the gels obtained by the methods of Blix (25Blix G. Acta. Chem. Scand. 1948; 2: 467Crossref Google Scholar) and Gardell (26Gardell S. Acta. Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 207-215Crossref Google Scholar). GAG binding activity was assayed by affinity column chromatography. Annexins were applied to a heparin-, heparan sulfate-, N-desulfated heparin-,N,O-desulfated heparin-, chondroitin sulfate A-, chondroitin sulfate B-, chondroitin sulfate C-, or chondroitin-Sepharose column (inner diameter, 0.3 × 7 cm) in the presence of 5 mmCaCl2, and the bound protein was eluted by stepwise elution with 2 mm EDTA and then 300 mm NaCl. The amount of protein in each fraction was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using rabbit anti-annexin polyclonal antibodies, HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, and o-phenylene diamine. GAG binding activity of peptide fragments produced from annexin VI were assayed using chondroitin sulfate C- and heparin-Sepharose 4B columns under the same conditions as those for intact annexin VI except for column size (inner diameter 0.5 × 7 cm). GST fusion annexin IV and annexin V, and native annexin VI were used. GAGs were coupled with the aid of N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (19Kitagaki-Ogawa H. Yathogo T Izumi M. Hayashi M Kashiwagi H. Matsumoto I. Seno N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1033: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A microtiter plate was coated with 100 μl of BSA-conjugated GAG in TBS (1 μg/ml heparin-BSA or 10 μg/ml chondroitin sulfate-BSA as protein concentration) at 4 °C overnight. The plate was blocked with 3% BSA in TBS for 2 h. Annexins at various concentration were added to each well and incubated for 1 h in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2. The amounts of GST-annexin IV or GST-annexin V, and annexin VI bound to BSA-GAG were monitored by ELISA using anti-GST antibodies and anti-annexin VI antibodies, respectively. On SDS-PAGE, proteins purified from bovine brain produced double bands corresponding to proteins with molecular masses of 34 and 35 kDa as was seen for annexin V (27Learmonth M.P. Howell S.A. Harris A.C.M. Amess B. Patel Y. Giambanco I. Bianchi R. Pula G. Ceccarelli P. Donato R. Green B.N. Aitken A. Biochim. Biophys.

The partial amino acid sequences of eight peptide fragments obtained after digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C were shown to be the same as those reported for annexin V (27Learmonth M.P. Howell S.A. Harris A.C.M. Amess B. Patel Y. Giambanco I. Bianchi R. Pula G. Ceccarelli P. Donato R. Green B.N. Aitken A. Biochim. Biophys.

The protein purified from bovine liver gave one band corresponding to a protein with a molecular mass of 66 kDa on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The value obtained was equivalent to the values reported for annexin VI: 68, 70, and 73 kDa, respectively. The partial amino acid sequences of eight liver protein fragments were identical to those of annexin VI (28Sudhof T.C. Slaughter C.A. Leznicki I. Barjon P. Reynolds G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar),i.e. 191WGTDEAOFIYILGNRSK217. Affinity chromatography technique was used to study the specific interactions between GAGs and annexins. GAGs have a negative charge derived from sulfate and carboxyl groups, and heparin is one of the most highly sulfated molecules among them. To examine the effect of sulfate groups of heparin on the interaction between annexins and heparin, desulfated heparins were also immobilized. For affinity chromatography, annexins were applied onto the GAG-columns in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 and eluted with 2 mm EDTA. In the case of annexin VI, an additional elution with 300 mm NaCl was performed. The results of affinity chromatography are shown in Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. Annexin IV bound to heparin and heparan sulfate in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 and was eluted with 2 mmEDTA. Complete chemical desulfation of heparin had no effect on the binding (Fig. 1 a). Annexin IV bound to chondroitin sulfate A, B, and C, and chondroitin in a calcium-dependent manner (Fig. 1 b).Figure 2Affinity chromatography of annexin V on GAG-Sepharose gels. Annexin V was applied to heparin-related GAG columns of heparin (•), heparan sulfate (○),N-desulfated heparin (▪), and N,O-desulfated heparin (□) (a), and to chondroitin sulfate-related GAG columns of chondroitin sulfate A (•), B (○), C (▪), and chondroitin (□) (b) in the presence of 5 mmCaCl2 and eluted with 2 mm EDTA. The detection of annexin V was performed by ELISA with anti-annexin V antibodies and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Affinity chromatography of annexin VI on GAG-Sepharose gels. Annexin VI was applied to heparin-related GAG columns of heparin (•), heparan sulfate (○),N-desulfated heparin (▪), and N,O-desulfated heparin (□) (a), and to chondroitin sulfate-related GAG columns of chondroitin sulfate A (•), B (○), C (▪), and chondroitin (□) (b) in the presence of 5 mmCaCl2 and eluted with 2 mm EDTA and 300 mm NaCl. The detection of annexin VI was performed by ELISA with anti-annexin VI antibodies and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Fig. 2 a, annexin V bound to heparin and heparan sulfate in a calcium-dependent manner. The desulfation of heparin significantly reduced its binding to annexin V, and the N-desulfation of heparin restored the binding only slightly, suggesting that the interaction between annexin V and heparin requires sulfate groups of heparin. In contrast, annexin V was not adsorbed onto chondroitin sulfate-related GAG-columns in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 2 b). Annexin VI was found to bind to the heparin and heparan sulfate columns in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2, and the binding was not dissociated by 2 mm EDTA but was with 300 mm NaCl (Fig. 3 a). In addition, annexin VI bound to heparin even in the absence of calcium (data not shown). Therefore, annexin VI binds to heparin and heparan sulfate in a calcium-independent manner. Annexin VI bound to N-desulfated heparin in a calcium-independent manner, but the protein adsorbed toN, O-desulfated heparin was eluted with 2 mm EDTA. Annexin VI was adsorbed onto the chondroitin sulfate A, B, and C and chondroitin columns in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 and eluted with 2 mm EDTA (Fig. 3 b). The binding of annexin VI to chondroitin sulfate-related GAGs required calcium and differed from that to heparin/heparan sulfate GAGs. The results of affinity chromatography were summarized in Table I. It is noteworthy that there are two modes of binding, one calcium-dependent and the other calcium-independent, and that the three annexins showed different binding specificities toward GAGs.Table IGlycosaminoglycan binding properties of annexinsGlycosaminoglycanAmount of GAG1-aThe concentrations of immobilized GAGs were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”AN IVAN VAN VImg/g of gelHeparin1.8+++*Heparan sulfate4.4+++*N-Desulfated heparin4.6+−+*N,O-Desulfated heparin1.9+−+Chondroitin sulfate A4.4+−+Chondroitin sulfate B3.2+−+Chondroitin sulfate C3.9+−+Chondroitin2.4+−+1-a The concentrations of immobilized GAGs were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Semi-quantitative binding assays on the annexins were also performed using heparin and chondroitin sulfate conjugated with BSA. As shown in Fig. 4, annexin IV, V, and VI bound to heparin immobilized on a microtiter plate dose-dependently. In the case of chondroitin sulfate, annexin IV and VI showed calcium-dependent specific binding. On the other hand, the interaction of annexin V with chondroitin sulfate was observed only at high concentrations of annexin. Annexin VI is unique structurally, containing eight conserved repeating units, in contrast to all other annexins, which have four repeating units. To investigate the domains of annexin VI responsible for the GAG binding activities, we prepared the annexin VI fragments by a limited proteolytic digestion and examined the binding activities of the fragments by affinity chromatography. Annexin VI was partially digested with V8 protease as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fragments produced were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. As shown in Fig. 5, three peptide fragments with molecular masses of 33, 19, and 14 kDa were observed. The assignment of each peptide fragment was performed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing after separation by SDS-PAGE and subsequent electroblotting onto a PVDF membrane. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 19-kDa fragment was LKGTVRPAG...... The sequence is identical to an amino acid sequence of the C-terminal half of annexin VI starting from leucine 352 in the linker region between repeat 4 and 5 (28Sudhof T.C. Slaughter C.A.

Portland Press, London1992: 86-87Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). The 14-kDa fragment gave the N-terminal sequence IADTTSGD......, which is identical to that starting from isoleucine 531. Therefore, both low molecular mass fragments were derived from the C-terminal half of annexin VI. The resistance of the 33-kDa fragment to Edman degradation indicates that this fragment is an N-terminal half because the N-terminal residue of annexin VI is blocked (28Sudhof T.C. Slaughter C.A.

Gel filtration chromatography showed that the 14- and 19-kDa fragments of annexin VI exist as an associated form with an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa (data not shown), which we hereafter call the C-terminal half.Figure 6The sequence alignment of the bovine annexin VI fragments with human annexin VI.

The 19- and 14-kDa fragments start in the linker region and at the seventh repeat, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid of annexin VI was reported to be blocked, suggesting that the 33-kDa fragment is an N-terminal half.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The digestion mixtures were directly applied onto the heparin-Sepharose column in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 and eluted with 2 mm EDTA and 300 mm NaCl. The fractions were collected, and the amount of the annexin VI fragments in each fraction was monitored by ELISA using anti-annexin VI antibodies. Peaks were observed from 2 mm EDTA- and 300 mmNaCl-eluted fractions (Fig. 7 a). SDS-PAGE detected a single band corresponding to the 33-kDa fragment in the 2 mm EDTA-eluted fraction and two bands corresponding to the 19- and 14-kDa fragments in the 300 mm NaCl-eluted fraction (Fig. 8). In the end, the N- and C-terminal halves bound to the heparin column, and the N-terminal half was eluted with EDTA, whereas the C-terminal half was eluted with 300 mm NaCl.Figure 8SDS-PAGE analysis of the annexin VI fractions eluted from the GAG columns. The flow-through fraction (lane 1) and the 2 mm EDTA-eluted fraction (lane 2) from the chondroitin sulfate C-column, and the 2 mmEDTA-eluted fraction (lane 3) and the 300 mmNaCl-eluted fraction (lane 4) from the heparin-column were analyzed using 13% SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results of chondroitin sulfate C-Sepharose affinity chromatography of the annexin VI fragments are shown in Fig. 7 b. The N-terminal half (the 33-kDa fragment) passed through the column, and the C-terminal half (the 19- and 14-kDa fragments) was adsorbed onto the column and eluted with EDTA (Fig. 8). Western blotting analysis showed that the N-terminal half of annexin VI was more sensitive to the antibodies than the C-terminal half (data not shown). The results indicate that the two halves of annexin VI have completely different binding properties for heparin and chondroitin sulfate C and, therefore, annexin VI has at least two distinct GAG-binding sites located in the N- and C-terminal halves of the annexin VI molecule. The finding that each annexin has distinct binding specificities supports the theory that the GAG binding activities are involved in the functional diversities of each annexin. On solid phase binding assay, annexin IV, V, and VI were found to bind dose-dependently to heparin, and annexin IV and VI to chondroitin sulfate. These findings agree with those of affinity chromatography. Complete chemical desulfation of heparin significantly reduced its binding to annexin V but not to annexin IV. Therefore, sulfate groups of heparin appear to be important for the calcium-dependent interaction between annexin V and heparin, and the calcium-independent inte"

Because of the potential of Ug to be a strong premutagenic lesion, it is important to assess whether it is a blocking lesion to DNA polymerase as is its structural counterpart, thymine glycol (Tg), and to evaluate its pairing properties. Here, a series of oligonucleotides containing Ug or Tg were prepared and used as templates for a model enzyme, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (exo−). During translesion DNA synthesis, Ug was bypassed more efficiently than Tg in all sequence contexts examined.

Ug opposite G and A was also recognized and removed in vitro by the E. coli DNA repair glycosylases, endonuclease III (endo III), endonuclease VIII (endo VIII), and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase. The steady state kinetic parameters indicated that Ug was a better substrate for endo III and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase than Tg; for endonuclease VIII, however, Tg was a better substrate.

Free radical-induced DNA damage is a substantial contributor to the spontaneous mutational burden and has been implicated in a variety of disease processes including cancer.

Biol. 1987; 51: 573-589Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar), while 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OHU) arises from sequential deamination and dehydration (11Wagner J.R. Hu C.-C. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3380-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Depending on the oxidizing agent used, uracil glycol and 5-hydroxycytosine are formed at comparable levels in DNA and furthermore, the background level of these lesions is high in DNA extracted from untreated cells (11Wagner J.R. Hu C.-C. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3380-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Oxidized pyrimidine lesions are repaired by a highly conserved process called base excision repair (for reviews, see Refs. 14Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar and 15Wallace S. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). The damaged pyrimidines are recognized by a class of enzymes called DNA glycosylases. The principal activities in Escherichia colithat recognize oxidized pyrimidines are endonuclease III (endo III) and endonuclease VIII (endo VIII) (see Refs. 14Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar and 15Wallace S. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar, and references therein); formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg) has also been shown to recognize oxidized pyrimidines in vitro (16Hatahet Z. Kow Y.W. Purmal A.A. Cunningham R.P. Wallace S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18814-18820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon recognition of an oxidized pyrimidine by a DNA glycosylase, the N-glycosylic bond is cleaved releasing the free base. This is followed by cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone by an associated DNA lyase activity which leaves a blocked 3′ terminus in the resulting nick (Refs. 14Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar and 15Wallace S. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar and references therein). The block, either an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde or a phosphate must be removed by the phosphodiesterase or phosphatase activity of another class of enzymes, the 5′ AP endonucleases (Refs. 14Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar and 15Wallace S. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar and references therein). This results in a single base gap which is filled in by DNA polymerase and sealed by DNA ligase (Refs. 14Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar and 15Wallace S. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar and references therein). If the lesion is not repaired prior to its encounter with the replication fork, it can either block DNA polymerase and thus be potentially lethal or it can be bypassed by DNA polymerase and be potentially mutagenic depending on its ability to mispair. Of the modified pyrimidine lesions retaining the intact pyrimidine ring that have been studied to date, only thymine glycol (Tg) is a strong blocking lesion to DNA polymerases in vitro (17Ide H. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8035-8052Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 18Rouet P. Essigmann J.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 6113-6118PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hayes R.C.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5398-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and is lethal in vivo (21Achey P.M. Wright C.F. Radiat. Res. 1983; 93: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Moran E. Wallace S.S. Mutat. Res. 1985; 146: 229-241PubMed Google Scholar, 23Laspia M.F. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3359-3366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other free radical-induced pyrimidine lesions, such as dihydrothymine (24Ide H. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), 5-OHU (25Purmal A.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and 5-OHC (25Purmal A.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), do not block DNA polymerases and are readily bypassed. Dihydrothymine always pairs with A and is not a mutagenic lesion (26Evans J. Maccabee P. Hatahet Z. Courcelle J. Bockrath R. Ide H. Wallace S.S. Mutat. Res. 1993; 299: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 5-OHC can pair with A in vitro (25Purmal A.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be mutagenic in E. coli (27Feig D.I. Sowers L.C. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6609-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). 5-OHU always pairs with Ain vitro (25Purmal A.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and because it is derived from C, it is a potentially important premutagenic lesion. Oxidized deoxynucleoside triphosphates from the nucleotide pools can also be incorporated into DNA; these may pair correctly or mispair. 5-OHdCTP and 5-OHdUTP are efficient substrates for E. coliDNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (Kf) (28Purmal A.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3930-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); 5-OHdUTP is incorporated in place of A and thus, if incorporated from the nucleotide pool, would not be mutagenic. 5-OHdCTP can be misincorporated as T and thus could be mutagenic. 8-Oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-dATP can also be incorporated into DNA; 8-oxo-dGTP is often misincorporated as T leading to T → G transversions (29Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 166-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the synthesis of dUgTP and shown it to be a reasonably efficient substrate for DNA polymerase I Kf (31Purmal A.A. Bond J.P. Lyons B.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to its structural relative, dTgTP, which is a poor substrate (24Ide H. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Purmal A.A. Bond J.P. Lyons B.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Both dUgTP and dTgTP are incorporated in place of T (31Purmal A.A. Bond J.P. Lyons B.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and thus would not be potentially mutagenic if incorporated from oxidized nucleotide pools. Here we report the enzymatic processing of Ug contained in template DNA and show that Ug is readily bypassed by the model enzyme, E. coli DNA polymerase I Kf(exo−), in contrast to Tg which is poorly bypassed except in certain sequence contexts. Only dAMP can be incorporated into DNA opposite Ug. Finally, Ug in DNA is a good substrate for endonucleases III and VIII and to a lesser extent for Fpg, but it cannot be removed by uracil DNA glycosylase. dTgTP and dUgTP were prepared as described previously (24Ide H. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Purmal A.A. Bond J.P. Lyons B.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); the 2′-deoxynucleoside triphosphates used in the DNA polymerase reactions and the Mono-Q 5/5 column were purchased from Pharmacia; Partisphere SAX, 0.4 × 12.5 cm, column was obtained from Whatman; 2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside triphosphates, Klenow fragment (10 μm/μl), Sequenase version 2.0 (13 μm/μl), T4 DNA ligase (5 μm/μl), and shrimp alkaline phosphatase were obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp.; terminal transferase (10 μm/ml) and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim; uracil DNA glycosylase (100 μm/μl) was obtained from Epicentre Technologies; E. coli endo III (10 μm), endo VIII (200 μm), and Fpg DNA glycosylase (6.6 μm) were purified as described previously (16Hatahet Z. Kow Y.W. Purmal A.A. Cunningham R.P. Wallace S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18814-18820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) was purchased from DuPont; ultrapure Sequagel sequencing system was obtained from National Diagnostics. All oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon Technologies or synthesized by the standard phosphoramidite method on a ABI 380A DNA synthesizer (Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont). 8-Oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine phosphoramidite, used to prepare 8-oxo-G-containing oligonucleotides, and tetrahydrofuran phosphoramidite, used to prepare the AP-containing oligonucleotides (catalog name “dSpacer”), were obtained from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). Lesion-containing oligonucleotides were deprotected in the presence of 0.25 m β-mercaptoethanol following the procedure recommended by Glen Research. The oligonucleotides were purified by Mono-Q anion-exchange chromatography on a Milton Roy HPLC system and by electrophoresis in a 12% polyacrylamide gel. After purification, oligonucleotides were desalted by gel-filtration on an NAP 5 column (Pharmacia) using water as an eluent. The oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase following standard procedures. Labeled oligonucleotides were further purified using a NENSORB 20 Nucleic Acids Purification Cartridge (DuPont). To obtain the desired final specific radioactivity, labeled oligonucleotides were combined with the appropriate cold oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides to be used in the ligation reaction were synthesized with 5′-phosphate. To monitor the ligation reaction and detect the ligation product, 5′-phosphate was removed from small amounts of the oligonucleotides (about 5 nmol) with 0.01 unit of shrimp alkaline phosphatase in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm MgCl2. Dephosphorylated oligonucleotides were purified using a NENSORB 20 cartridge and 5′-32P-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using standard procedures. Labeled oligonucleotides were further purified using a NENSORB 20 cartridge and combined with the same cold 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotide to obtain the desired final specific radioactivity. 18-, 37-, and 45-mer oligonucleotides containing a single, internal Ug or Tg (templates 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, Fig. 1) were prepared by a modification of a method previously described (32Hatahet Z. Purmal A.A. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. 1–2.5 nmol of GCAGCCAAAACGTCC, CCTTCG, or CCTTCGT were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 65 μl of buffer containing 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, 1 mm CoCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1–0.12 mm dUgTP, or 0.18–0.2 mm dTgTP and 100 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The oligonucleotides extended from the 3′-end with a single dUgTP or dTgTP were then high performance liquid chromatography purified on a Partisphere SAX column (0.4 × 12.5 cm, Whatman) using a linear gradient of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3 (from 5 mm to 0.5 mover 60 min), containing 25% acetonitrile. The purified extended oligonucleotides, GCAGCCAAAACGTCCX, CCTTCGX, or CCTTCGTX (X = Ug or Tg), were desalted using NAP-5 columns (Pharmacia) and ligated using T4 DNA ligase with32pGGATGGTCTGTCCCTTGAATCGATAGGGG,32pTACTTTCCTCT, or 32pACTTTCCTCT, respectively, using the appropriate “scaffolding” oligonucleotides GACAGACCATCCAGGACGTTTTGGCTGC or AGAGGAAAGTAACGAAGG. 37-Mers (templates 4 and 5, Fig. 1) were obtained by the ligation of CCTTCGX or CCTTCGTX (X = Ug or Tg) with32pTACTTTCCTCTTCCCTTGAATCGATAGGGG or32pACTTTCCTCTTCCCTTGAATCGATAGGGG, respectively, using AGAGGAAAGTAACGAAGG as a scaffold. All 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides used for ligation contained a low specific activity 5′-32P label (about 10 nCi) for detection of the ligation products. In later experiments, the radioactivity of the internal32P label was below the level of detection by autoradiography during the exposure time used for the detection of 5′-terminal 32P label. Ligation reactions were performed for 10–15 h at 15 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm ATP, 10 μm nicked duplex oligonucleotide, and 0.5 unit/μl reaction mixture of T4 DNA ligase. After ligation, the strands containing the lesion were separated from the scaffolding oligonucleotide by electrophoresis on 12 or 20% polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions, electroeluted from the gel, and desalted using NAP-5 columns. The ligation efficiency of oligonucleotides containing 3′-dUg or -dTg was lower than those containing 3′-dT. The yield of ligation products of oligonucleotides without lesions was 90–95%. Under the same reaction conditions, the conversion of 3′ modified oligonucleotides into ligation products ranged between 45 and 60%. Appropriate amounts of templates 1, 4, and 5 were annealed to a 32P-labeled primer 1 (Fig. 1) in Buffer P (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 30 mm NaCl, 4 mmdithiothreitol) and treated with an excess of uracil DNA glycosylase following the manufacturer's instructions. A double-stranded 18-mer oligonucleotide duplex containing an abasic site, which was used as a substrate for DNA repair endonucleases, was prepared by annealing 5′-32P-labeled template 2 with U in position 7 to 18-mer 2 (Fig. 1) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA buffer followed by treatment of the duplex with excess uracil DNA glycosylase following the manufacturer's instructions. The bypass of Ug and Tg in different sequence contexts was studied using various concentrations of Kf(exo−) (10−5-10−2μm/μl). In the typical bypass assay, a primer oligonucleotide containing the 5′-32P label was annealed to a template with single Ug or Tg. The primer-template complex (50 nm) was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with Kf(exo−) in 6 μl of the reaction mixture, containing Buffer P and four dNTP's (64 μm each). The same conditions were used for the “running start” primer extension reaction. Here the concentration of Kf(exo−) was 1.6 × 10−3 μm/μl and the concentration of each of four dNTP's was 50 μm. Extension of the primer with only one nucleotide was performed similarly to the bypass assay using 5 μm of only one of the four dNTP's in each experiment and 2.5–6 × 10−4 μm/ml Kf(exo−). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 15 °C. Sequencing reactions were performed using T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase version 2.0) following the supplier's recommendations (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). To determine the kinetic parameters for lesion bypass, a steady state kinetic assay (33Boosalis M. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. The reaction mixture was prepared by adding 3.5 μl of a solution containing primer32pTCAAGGGACAGACCAT, annealed to (template 1, Fig. 1) Kf(exo−) and the buffer to 2.5 μl of water solution containing dCTP and dATP. The final mixture (6 μl) contained 0.02 unit of Kf(exo−), Buffer P, 50 nmprimer-template complex, 50 μm dCTP, and various concentrations of dATP (0.05–10 μm). Reactions were incubated at 4 °C. Reaction times varied between 0.5 and 2 min. For endo III, endo VIII, and Fpg DNA glycosylase assays, the standard reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 100 nm double-stranded oligonucleotide substrate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1–100 nm enzyme. In all experiments, the strand containing the lesion was 5′-32P-labeled. Each enzyme reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of loading buffer and reaction products were analyzed in a 13% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. To determine kinetic parameters, a 5′-32P-labeled template 2 (Fig. 1) containing Ug or Tg at position 7 was annealed to 18-mer 2 (Fig. 1) in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA buffer. As a control for the Fpg DNA glycosylase reaction, a 24-mer32pGAACTAGTGG(8-oxo-G)TCCCCCGGGCTGC was annealed to the appropriate 24-mer complement strand. For all substrates, the concentration range used was 20–300 nm. Endo III, endo VIII, and Fpg DNA glycosylase were used in the 2–5 nmconcentration range. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were withdrawn at 0.5-min intervals and quenched with gel loading buffer. For each substrate and enzyme, the data obtained were then fitted to calculate the apparent Km and Vmaxvalues using the Macintosh program, k.cat (BioMetallics, Inc.). All DNA polymerase reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer (95% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 20 mm EDTA). Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 0.4 mm, 13% polyacrylamide gels containing 8m urea. The gels were electrophoresed in 50 mmTris borate, 2 mm EDTA buffer, pH 8.3, for 1.5–3 h at 2000 V, dried under vacuum, and exposed to x-ray film. The radioactivity in the bands corresponding to the products of enzymatic reactions were analyzed using a Model GS-250 Molecular Imager System (Bio-Rad). Tg is assumed to be the A conformer (as defined by Miller and Miaskiewicz (34Miller J. Miaskiewicz K. DNA Damage: Effects on DNA Structure and Protein Recognition. The New York Academy of Sciences, New York1994: 71-91Google Scholar)), the 5R,6S-stereoisomer in which the hydroxyl groups at the C5 and C6 positions are in the pseudoequatorial (5-eq) and pseudoaxial (6-ax) positions, respectively (see Kung and Bolton (35Kung H.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9227-9236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and references therein for a discussion of the identification of the cis-stereoisomer of Tg formed in DNA, and Miaskiewicz and Miller (36Miaskiewicz K.

The 5-eq/6-ax enantiomers of Ug were found to be the most stable cis-isomers of Ug based onab initiocalculations 2A. Derecski-Kovacs, S. S. Wallace, and J. P. Bond, unpublished data. and the 5R,6S species was identified as the dominant conformer obtained from the synthesis procedure using NMR (31Purmal A.A. Bond J.P. Lyons B.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The methods for obtaining geometries and force field parameters for Tg and Ug have been described previously (31Purmal A.A. Bond J.P. Lyons B.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, geometries were obtained using Gaussian 94 (Gaussian, Inc.), partial charges were obtained, based on the Gaussian 94 calculations, using the RESP procedure of Kollman and co-workers (37Bayley C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-101280Crossref Scopus (5533) Google Scholar), and the remaining force field parameters were chosen from the AMBER set (38Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayley C. Gould I.R. Merz K.M., JR. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11498) Google Scholar). Damaged bases were modeled into DNA by replacing the pyrimidine of the central base pair in 7-base pair B-DNA fragments as described previously (31Purmal A.A. Bond J.P. Lyons B.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and LeaP (39Pearlman, D. A., Case, D. A., Caldwell, J. W., Ross, W. S., Cheatham, T. E., III, Ferguson, D.

Energy minimization and molecular dynamics of the counterions and solvent were followed by energy minimization and short molecular dynamics simulations of the entire systems. Nucleic acid structure parameters (40Dickerson R. Bansal M Christopher R Diekmann S. Hunter W. Kennard O. von Kitzing E. Lavery R. Nelson H. Olson W. Saenger W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1797-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) were measured using the Biopolymer module of Insight® II from Biosym/MSI (which is based on the NEWHEL 91 program suite of Dickerson and co-workers). We note that the numerous limitations of the molecular modeling procedure used here (e.g. the absence of polymerase, the length of the DNA fragments, the duration of the simulations, and the use of B-DNA for the starting conformation) make it impossible to derive quantitative conclusions based on structure. The objective of the molecular mechanics calculations was to relieve the substantial steric repulsions that resulted from introduction of the damaged bases in B-DNA, and in doing so provide a plausible illustration of the impact of the difference between the A conformers of Tg and Ug on DNA structure. During the brief simulation, the Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds of the undamaged pairs remained essentially intact. Thymine glycol has been shown to be a strong block to several DNA polymerases (17Ide H. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8035-8052Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 18Rouet P. Essigmann J.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 6113-6118PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hayes R.C. LeClerc J.E.

When Tg was randomly introduced into DNA, it constituted an absolute block to Kf in all but one sequence context, 5′-C(Tg)Pu-3′ (19Hayes R.C. LeClerc J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 1045-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Evans J. Maccabee P. Hatahet Z. Courcelle J. Bockrath R. Ide H. Wallace S.S. Mutat. Res. 1993; 299: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To compare the bypass of Ug and Tg by Kf(exo−), three different DNA templates containing Ug or Tg in the sequence contexts 5′-CXG-3′ (known Tg bypass context, see Refs. 19Hayes R.C. LeClerc J.E.

As a “no lesion” control, templates 1, 4, and 5 contained T in place of Tg or Ug and as a “complete blockage” control, templates 1, 4, and 5 contained an abasic site. The same 5′-32P-labeled primer 1 was used with all three templates. Figs. 2 and3 show the results of translesion synthesis using these templates with different concentrations of Kf(exo−). With the “bypass sequence context” (Fig. 2), both Tg and Ug were bypassed at high concentrations (10−2and 10−3 μm/μl) of Kf(exo−) (lanes 9, 10, and 13, 14, Fig. 2). At 10−2 μm/μl of Kf(exo−), even an abasic site was successfully bypassed (lane 1, Fig. 2); however, an almost complete block was observed with an abasic site (lane 2, Fig. 2) at 10−3 μm/μl where Tg was bypasssed (lane 10, Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W1970804941,"The leptin receptor (Ob-R) is alternatively spliced into at least five different RNAs designated Ob-R(a-e). Ob-R(a-d) predict receptors with a single transmembrane domain, and Ob-Re predicts a secreted form of the receptor. The presence of an ∼120-kDa soluble leptin receptor in mouse plasma was confirmed by precipitation with leptin-Sepharose beads followed by immunobloting with anti-leptin receptor antibodies. The soluble leptin receptor is larger than that predicted by the primary sequence. Deglycosylation of the receptor with peptide N:glycosidase F results in a decrease in molecular mass to a size consistent with that of the primary sequence. The secreted receptor was present in plasma from wild type mice but was truncated in plasma fromdb 3J /db 3J and absent indb Pas /db Pas plasma. Although db 3J /db 3J mice are known to have a frameshift mutation at amino acid 625, the basis for the mutation indb Pas /db Pas mice was not known. Further studies indicated thatdb Pas /db Pas mice carry a duplication of exons 4 and 5 of Ob-R. This mutation introduces a premature stop codon into the protein at amino acid 281. The absence of Ob-R in db 3J /db 3J and db Pas /db Pas mice confirm the identify of the 120-kDa plasma protein as Ob-Re. The leptin receptor (Ob-R) is alternatively spliced into at least five different RNAs designated Ob-R(a-e). Ob-R(a-d) predict receptors with a single transmembrane domain, and Ob-Re predicts a secreted form of the receptor. The presence of an ∼120-kDa soluble leptin receptor in mouse plasma was confirmed by precipitation with leptin-Sepharose beads followed by immunobloting with anti-leptin receptor antibodies. The soluble leptin receptor is larger than that predicted by the primary sequence.

Leptin is an adipocyte hormone that functions as an afferent signal in a negative feedback loop regulating body weight (1Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M.

Leptin exerts its weight-reducing effects via interaction with a receptor, Ob-R, which is localized in the hypothalamus and other tissues (8Tartaglia L.A. Dembski M. Weng X. Deng N. Culpepper J.

Four of the splice variants, Ob-R(a-d), encode a receptor with a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic region of variable length (9Lee G.H. Proenca R. Montez J.M. Carroll K.M. Darvishzadeh J.G. Lee J.I. Nature. 1996; 379: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar). Ob-Rb encodes a leptin receptor with a long intracytoplasmic region that contains several motifs known to be important for protein-protein interactions and signal transduction (9Lee G.H. Proenca R.

One of the splice variants, Ob-Re, does not encode a transmembrane domain and predicts a secreted form of the receptor (11Lee G. Li C. Montez J. Halaas J. Darvishzadeh J. Friedman J.M. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 445-447Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The db gene has been shown to be allelic with Ob-R. Three mouse alleles of db are available, each of which leads to severe early onset obesity and diabetes. The C57BL/Ks db/dbmutation affects splicing of Ob-R and leads to the specific loss of Ob-Rb RNA (9Lee G.H. Proenca R. Montez J.M. Carroll K.M. Darvishzadeh J.G. Lee J.I.

Li C. Montez J. Halaas J. Darvishzadeh J. Friedman J.M. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 445-447Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The nature of these mutations predicts that C57BL/Ks db/db mice should be missing only the Ob-Rb isoform and that 129db 3J /db 3J mice should carry mutations of all receptor forms. As the basis for the db Pas /db Pas mutation was not previously known, the affect of this allele on receptor protein(s) could not be predicted. Assays of the plasma levels of Ob-R protein were made in wild type and mutant mice. Specific antibodies to Ob-R were used to assay for the presence of Ob-Re, the secreted form of the leptin receptor, in plasma from wild type and mutant mice. An ∼120-kDa protein corresponding to a glycosylated form of Ob-Re circulates in plasma from wild type and C57BL/Ks db/db mice. The wild type protein was absent in plasma from 129 db 3J /db 3Jmice as well asdb Pas /db Pas animals. db Pas /db Pas mice were shown to carry a duplication in the extracellular region of Ob-R that ablates expression of all of the receptor variants. Recombinant mouse leptin was obtained from Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). Baculovirus cloning vector pMelBac was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). PNGase F 1The abbreviations used are: PNGase F, N-glycosidase F; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Lepr, leptin receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. was from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA) ob/ob mice,db 3J /db 3J mice, as well as wild type C57Balb/C mice were from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME). db Pas /db Pas and lean littermates were from the Pasteur Institute (Paris, France). Continuous sucrose gradient was used for rate zonal centrifugation. Mouse recombinant leptin (Amgen, 50 ng) in a final volume of 100 μl of either PBS or ob/ob serum were loaded onto a linear gradient of 5–20% w/v sucrose in PBS (pH 7.4). The run parameters were 55,000 rpm at 5 °C for 12 h using the SW55 Ti rotor. At the end of the run, 13 fractions of 400 μl each were collected and measured by the Bausch and Lomb hand refractometer to ascertain the sucrose concentration at each separated zone. Fractions were analyzed for leptin using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech was coupled to recombinant mouse leptin from Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA) following manufacturer's instructions. Coupled resin was kept at 4 °C in PBS (Life Technologies, Inc.) as a 50% slurry (v/v) in the presence of 0.02% sodium azide. About 1 mg of leptin was coupled for every ml of Sepharose. To affinity purify the soluble leptin receptor, mouse plasma was first prepared following an eye bleed procedure. Blood was mixed with EDTA to give a final concentration of 2 mm, which was centrifuged for 7 min at 4,000 ×g. The resulting supernatant was used directly for leptin binding. In a typical experiment, 12.5 μl of leptin beads was incubated with 100 μl of mouse plasma diluted in 150 μl of PBS. Incubation was allowed overnight at 4 °C, and beads were then washed three times in cold PBS. The pellet was reconstituted in 1× SDS sample buffer and loaded onto an 8% gel. Bound receptor was analyzed with antipeptide antibodies of Ob-R. Peptide antibodies against Ob-R were generated by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Two antibodies were used to detect the receptor: antibody A (corresponding to amino acids 145–158 of mouse Ob-R, amino acid sequences EPLPKNPFKNYDSK) and antibody B (corresponding to amino acids 465–484 of mouse Ob-R, amino acid sequences HRRSLYCPDSPSIHPTSEPK). Ob-Re cDNA was subcloned into the vector pMelBac (Invitrogen, CA), a polyhedrin promoter-based transfer cloning vector of baculovirus. This vector is designed to direct expression of recombinant proteins through the secretory pathway to the extracellular medium. The vector contains a signal sequence for honeybee melittin, which is efficiently secreted by SF9 cells, the host for the baculovirus. To subclone Ob-Re into pMelBac, the endogenous signal sequence of the leptin receptor was not used. It was replaced by the honeybee melittin signal sequence to achieve efficient secretion of the receptor. Ob-R sequence starts at amino acid residue 28 and ends at residue 805 of Ob-Re (GenBankTM accession number U49110) containing 778 amino acids of Ob-Re sequence. Inserts were obtained by PCR using primers that contain restriction sites at both ends for subcloning into pMelBac. Large scale expression of recombinant protein was produced in suspension culture. Supernatant from productive stocks was used directly in the assay for leptin binding. Signal for Ob-R can be obtained directly from 1 μl of total supernatant. In a binding experiment, 15 μl of the supernatant was used for incubation with the leptin-Sepharose. Binding of leptin-Sepharose to mouse plasma and baculovirus supernatant was as described above. At the last wash with PBS, sample was divided into two halves, and pellet was saved for the deglycosylation reaction. Bound protein on leptin-Sepharose beads were denatured by boiling in denaturation buffer for 10 min followed by treatment with or without 1 μl of PNGase F (500 units/μl; New England Biolabs, MA) at 37 °C for 3 h. At the end of the incubation, equal volume of 2× sample buffer was added to each tube, and the entire reaction was loaded onto a 7% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted with anti-receptor antibody A. RNA was purified from adult hypothalami of wild type and db Pas /db Pasmice using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using random primers and SuperScript II Rnase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, MD). Heat-denatured sample was used directly for reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis. To analyze the mutation of Lepr indb Pas /db Pas mouse, three pairs of primers spanning about 1 kilobase, each overlapping each other, were used to amplify wild type and mutant cDNA.

Cycle parameters are 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s for a total of 40 cycles. PCR products were purified using Centricon-30 from Amicon (Beverly, MA) by diluting the sample with H2O and spinning at 4 °C until sample contains DNA at a concentration of 0.1 μg/μl. Sequencing of PCR products was performed by the sequencing facility at the Protein DNA Technology Center of The Rockefeller University. Previous data have indicated mouse and human leptin sediment with a higher molecular mass than that predicted of a 16-kDa protein, suggesting that leptin circulates bound to other proteins (12Houseknecht K.L. Mantzoros C.S. Kuliawat R. Hadro E. Flier J.S. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1638-1643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13Sinha M.K. Opentanova I. Ohannesian J.P. Kolaczynski J.W. Heiman M.L. Becker G.W. Bowsher R.R. Stephens T.W. Caro J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). To confirm this, either human or mouse plasma was loaded on a 5–20% sucrose gradient. The gradient fractions were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 1) (12Houseknecht K.L. Mantzoros C.S. Kuliawat R. Hadro E. Flier J.S. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1638-1643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sinha M.K. Opentanova I. Ohannesian J.P. Kolaczynski J.W. Heiman M.L. Becker G.W. Bowsher R.R. Stephens T.W. Caro J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). These data confirmed that a fraction of endogenous human leptin sediments on a sucrose gradient in lower fractions than leptin diluted in PBS (data not shown). When recombinant leptin was added to plasma from ob/ob mice (which are leptin-deficient), its sedimentation was shifted (Fig. 1). The apparent molecular mass of the complex is ∼100-kDa (within the limits of resolution of the sucrose gradient). Although the nature of the leptin binding protein(s) was not known, soluble leptin receptor was a possible candidate. Soluble leptin receptor was detected using a leptin affinity resin and specific anti-receptor antibodies. Recombinant mouse leptin was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and mixed with mouse plasma. After centrifugation, the precipitated proteins were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and immunobloted. The blots were developed using either of two antibodies directed against peptides predicted by the Ob-R cDNA sequence. The position of these peptides on the receptor amino acid sequence are shown (Fig. 2 A,bottom). Both antibodies detected a band of ∼120-kDa in the material precipitated by the leptin-Sepharose. Although a lower molecular weight protein was also detected, this protein was seen after precipitation using bovine serum albumin-Sepharose beads (data not shown). It is likely to be a cross-reactive protein unrelated to Ob-Re. The size of Ob-Re was larger than that predicted by its primary sequence. This suggested the possibility that Ob-Re is glycosylatedin vivo. To test this, the leptin-Sepharose precipitates were imunoblotted with or without PNGase F treatment. PNGase F is an enzyme that removes sugar moieties from glycoproteins. A baculovirus construct expressing the soluble leptin receptor was used as a positive control. The baculovirus supernatant contained immunoreactive material of ∼90-kDa that was precipitated by leptin beads (Fig. 2 A). The addition of an excess of recombinant leptin inhibited binding of soluble receptor to the leptin-Sepharose beads (Fig. 2 B). The baculovirus receptor protein migrated at a different position from native Ob-Re (∼90-kDa versus 120 kDa), possibly due to differences in glycosylation from that of native leptin receptor. To confirm this, mouse plasma and baculovirus supernatant were mixed with leptin-Sepharose beads, and the precipitated proteins were treated with or without PNGase. PNGase F-treated Ob-Re, both from baculovirus and plasma, migrate to a near identical position after SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of ∼75-kDa (Fig. 2 C). Several lower molecular mass bands that were seen after the PNGase F treatment are likely the result of partial proteolysis. These data suggest that the glycosylation state of native and baculovirus Ob-Re is different. Although the 120-kDa soluble leptin receptor was present in plasma from wild type and C57BL/Ks db/db mice, the wild type receptor was absent in db 3J /db 3Jmouse (Fig. 3). This mutation results in truncation of the leptin receptor at amino acid 625 (11Lee G. Li C. Montez J. Halaas J. Darvishzadeh J. Friedman J.M. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 445-447Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A band of ∼95-kDa was seen in plasma from these mice (Fig. 3). In addition, Ob-Re was not detected in this assay in plasma fromdb Pas /db Pas mice. Several lower molecular mass bands were also visible in all lanes. These bands were also seen when plasma was mixed with bovine serum albumin-Sepharose, suggesting that they are not specific. The absence of Ob-Re indb Pas /db Pas mice suggested that the Ob-R mutation in these mice was likely to affect the extracellular region of the receptor. To confirm this possibility, three pairs of primers were prepared, each of which spanned 1 kilobase at the NH2 terminus of Lepr (Fig. 4 A). These primers were used to amplify first-strand cDNA from wild type and db Pas /db Pas total hypothalamic RNA. The positions of the primers on the Ob-R cDNA are shown along with the size of the amplification products after electrophoresis on an 0.8% agarose gel (Fig. 4 A). PCR products of identical size were amplified from wild type and db Pas /db Pas RNA using primer pairs B and C. However, primer pair A amplified a 1.4-kb product in db Pas /db Pas cDNAversus 1 kb in wild type mice. This PCR product was sequenced using an automatic sequencer (Fig. 4 B). The sequence identified a 359-base pair duplication in the mutant cDNA. Based on the published genomic structure, this duplication corresponds to exons 4 and 5 of the leptin receptor (14Chung W.K. Power-Kehoe L. Chua M. Lee R. Leibel R.L. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The duplication introduces a stop codon one residue after amino acid 281 and is predicted to result in the loss of all Lepr isoforms. This duplication was also confirmed using genomic Southern blotting. When exons 4 and 5 were used as probes, signal intensity was about twice as high in db Pas /db Pas miceversus wild type mice (data not shown). These data indicate that db Pas /db Pasmice have a duplication in the extracellular region of Ob-R that alters the expression of all receptor isoforms. Leptin circulates in mouse and human plasma either as a free 16-kDa protein or bound to other proteins (12Houseknecht K.L. Mantzoros C.S. Kuliawat R. Hadro E. Flier J.S. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1638-1643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sinha M.K. Opentanova I. Ohannesian J.P. Kolaczynski J.W. Heiman M.L. Becker G.W. Bowsher R.R. Stephens T.W. Caro J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The identity of these leptin-binding proteins has not been previously elucidated, although a secreted form of the leptin receptor was a logical candidate. The data presented here confirm that soluble leptin receptor is present in mouse plasma. However, the data do not exclude the possibility that proteins other than Ob-Re also bind to leptin. Several consensus sequences for glycosylation are contained in the Ob-R coding sequence (8Tartaglia L.A. Dembski M. Weng X. Deng N. Culpepper J. Devos R. Campfield L.A. Clark F.T. Deeds J. Muir C. Sanker S. Moriarty A. Moore K.V. Smutko J.S. Mays G.G. Woolf E.A. Monroe C.A. Tepper R.I. Cell. 1995; 83: 1263-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3196) Google Scholar). The size of the soluble leptin receptor is larger than that predicted by its amino acid sequence, suggesting that it is glycosylated. The truncation of Ob-Re after PNGase F treatment confirms that it is glycosylated. This conclusion is supported by the observation that after PNGase F treatment, baculovirus and native Ob-Re migrate to the same position by SDS-PAGE. The identify of this 120-kDa band as Ob-Re is also confirmed by the absence of the wild type protein in plasma fromdb Pas /db Pas and db 3J /db 3J mice. Thedb 3J /db 3J mutation was previously predicted to encode a 625-amino acid secreted protein (11Lee G. Li C. Montez J. Halaas J. Darvishzadeh J. Friedman J.M. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 445-447Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The observation that Ob-Re is truncated in plasma from its mutant supports this. The mutation indb Pas /db Pas mice is shown here to result from a duplication resulting in the synthesis of a 281-amino acid protein. (Fig. 5). Ob-Re is not detectable in plasma fromdb Pas /db Pas mice. This suggests that in this mutant, Ob-Re mRNA is not efficiently translated or that its protein may be degraded. Alternatively, the truncated protein may not bind to the leptin-Sepharose. The observation that leptin-Sepharose resin precipitates Ob-R suggests that soluble receptor may be present in excess relative to leptin in mouse plasma. This is surprising given the observation that only a portion of mouse and human leptin sediments with the apparent molecular mass of free leptin (12Houseknecht K.L. Mantzoros C.S. Kuliawat R. Hadro E. Flier J.S. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1638-1643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sinha M.K. Opentanova I. Ohannesian J.P. Kolaczynski J.W. Heiman M.L. Becker G.W. Bowsher R.R. Stephens T.W. Caro J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). It may be that the leptin-Sepharose displaces leptin already bound to Ob-Re in plasma. The function of Ob-Re remains to be determined. Soluble forms of other cytokine receptors are also found to circulate in plasma (15Leung D.W. Spencer S.A. Cachianes G. Hammonds R.G. Collins C. Henzel W.J.B. Waters M.J. Wood W.I. Nature. 1987; 330: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). In most cases the circulating receptor acts to chelate the ligand and acts as an inhibitor. This is also possible with leptin. Alternatively, soluble Ob-R could play a role in other aspects of leptin function such as reuptake after filtration by the kidney or in transport across the blood brain barrier (16Cumin F. Baum H.P. Levens N. Int. J. Obes. 1996; 20: 1120-1126PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cumin F. Baum H.P. de Gasparo M. Levens N. Int. J. Obes. 1997; 21: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Available data indicate that the hypothalamus is an important target of leptin action and that a saturable transport system is responsible for leptin access to its site of action in the brain (18Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. Huang W. Jaspan J.B. Maness L.M. Peptides. 1996; 17: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 19Golden P.L. Maccagnan T.J. Pardridge W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to determine whether Ob-Re plays a role in these aspects of leptin's function. The availability of recombinant receptor expressed in baculovirus will facilitate these studies. It is as yet unclear whether the affinity of leptin for membrane-bound and soluble receptor in vivo is similar. A recent report did show that when the entire extracellular region of Ob-R is expressed in COS7 cells, it binds to leptin with similar affinity as that of the full-length transmembrane receptor (20Liu C. Liu X.J. Barry G. Ling N. Maki R.A. De Souza E.B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3548-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is also not known whether baculovirus Ob-Re binds to leptin with an affinity similar to that of membrane-bound receptor expressed in mammalian cells (21Devos R. Guisez Y. Van der Heyden J. White D.W. Kalai M. Fountoulakis M. Plaetinck G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18304-18310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). With the identification of the db Pas /db Pas mutation, the molecular nature of all the rodent db (and fa) alleles is known. Three of the mutations truncate the receptor in the extracellular region, whereas the db mutation in C57BL/Ks mice is the result of a splicing mutation. This mutation specifically alters splicing of Ob-Rb, highlighting the importance of this receptor variant. Further studies of the other receptor forms (Ob-R(a-d)) will be required to evaluate their functions. We would like to thank Amgen for providing us with recombinant leptin, Dr. Jean-Louis Guenet (Pasteur Institute, Paris) for providing us withdb Pas /db Pas mice, Drs. Jeff Winick, Jeff Halaas, and Jason Montez for stimulating discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2030546369,"It has been reported that respiratory epithelium-specific transcription is mediated by thyroid transcription factor 1 and members of the HNF3/forkhead family of transcription factors. Here, we show that the uteroglobin/Clara cell 10-kDa promoters from rabbit and man are regulated by HNF3α and HNF3β but not by HFH-4 and TTF-1. We have identified two HNF3-responsive elements in the rabbit uteroglobin/CC10 promoter located around 95 and 130 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site. Both elements contribute to promoter activity in H441 cells expressing uteroglobin/CC10 and HNF3α. Gene transfer experiments into DrosophilaSchneider cells that lack many mammalian transcription factor homologs revealed that HNF3α and HNF3β on their own cannot activate the uteroglobin/CC10 promoter. However, HNF3α and HNF3β strongly enhanced Sp1-mediated promoter activation. Synergistic activation by HNF3α and Sp1 was absolutely dependent on the integrity of two Sp1 sites located at around −65 and −230. We show further that multiple activation domains of Sp1 are required for cooperativity with HNF3α. These studies demonstrate that transcription from the rabbit uteroglobin/CC10 promoter in lung epithelium is controlled by the combinatorial action of the cell-specific factor HNF3α and the ubiquitous factor Sp1.

The level and pattern of expression of a gene is determined mainly by the combinatorial action of transcription factors binding to distinct promoter and enhancer elements. In the last years, we have started to define DNA elements and transcription factors responsible for the expression of the rabbit uteroglobin/CC10 (Clara cell 10-kDa protein) gene, which is expressed in several ontogenetically unrelated epithelial tissues. Highest expression of the uteroglobin/CC10 gene is observed in endometrium and lung (1Aumüller G. Seitz J. Heyns W. Kirchner C. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Warembourg M. Tranchant O. Atger M. Milgrom E. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1632-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In endometrium, expression of the gene is restricted to the glandular and luminal epithelium (1Aumüller G. Seitz J. Heyns W. Kirchner C. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), where it is induced by progesterone and estradiol (3Müller H. Beato M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In lung, Clara cells lining the respiratory epithelium express constitutively uteroglobin/CC10 at high levels. In these cells, glucocorticoids modulate the uteroglobin/CC10 mRNA level only slightly (4Fernandez-Renau D. Lombardero M. Nieto A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 5Lopez de Haro M.S. Nieto A. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). DNase I protection, promoter deletion, and linker-scanning analyses revealed that at least six distinct regions contribute to the activity of the promoter in the epithelial endometrium cell line Ishikawa and and the lung cell line H441 (6Misseyanni A. Klug J. Suske G. Beato M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2849-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Suske G. Lorenz W. Klug J. Gazdar A.F. Beato M. Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 339-352PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the transcription factors acting through these elements have been identified in the last years. Regions VI and II located 230 and 65 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); LS, linker-scanning mutant; DLS, double linker-scanning mutant; LDL, low density lipoprotein; SREBP, sterol receptor element-binding protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; HFH, HNF3/forkhead homolog; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; SP, surfactant protein. upstream of the transcription start site are noncanonical binding sites for the closely related transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 (8Dennig J. Hagen G. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12737-12744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Region V spans at least 60 nucleotides between −208 and −148 and probably contains several DNA elements that have not been characterized further. Regions III (around −95) and IV (around −130) are characterized by two A/T-rich nucleotide stretches. Region I contains a noncanonical TATA box motif (TACA box) which is bound specifically by two factors, the TATA core factor and the TATA palindrome factor (9Klug J. Knapp S. Castro I. Beato M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6208-6218Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Both are different from the TATA box-binding protein. TATA palindrome factor has recently been identified as the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) (10Klug J. Beato M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6398-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Studies of other genes specifically expressed in lung epithelium (surfactant protein A, surfactant protein B, and murine CC10) provided evidence that thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), which is expressed in addition to the thyroid and the brain also in lung type II and Clara cells (11Lazzaro D.

In the present study, we analyzed various different human lung cell lines for the expression of lung epithelium-specific marker genes. We show that H441 cells express human uteroglobin/CC10 mRNA in addition to several other lung epithelial cell-specific mRNAs. We demonstrate that the rabbit uteroglobin/CC10 gene promoter responds to the transcription factors HNF3α and HNF3β, but not to TTF-1 and HFH-4. Promoter deletion and linker-scanning analysis identified two functional elements for HNF3α/HNF3β around −130 and −95. The factors present in H441 cells and acting through these elements are HNF3α and Oct-1. Transfection studies into DrosophilaSchneider cells that lack many mammalian transcription factor homologs revealed that HNF3α and HNF3β on their own cannot activate the uteroglobin/CC10 promoter, but that both proteins strongly enhance Sp1-mediated promoter activation. This study also demonstrates that synergistic activation by HNF3α and Sp1 is absolutely dependent on the integrity of the two Sp1 sites located at around −230 bp and −65 bp. In addition, we show that several activation domains of Sp1 are required for cooperativity with HNF3α. The construction of the wild-type rabbit uteroglobin/CC10 promoter construct pUG(−395)CATSV as well as the linker-scanning mutants LS(−92/−99), LS(−127/−132), LS(−64/−72), and LS(−222/−229) fused to the CAT gene have been described (7Suske G. Lorenz W. Klug J. Gazdar A.F. Beato M. Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 339-352PubMed Google Scholar). The double linker-scanning mutants DLS(−92/−127) and DLS(−64/−222) were generated by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis using appropriate oligonucleotides. The human CC10 promoter-CAT construct (hCC10-CATSV) was obtained by replacing the 410-bp BamHI rabbit UG promoter fragment in pUG(−395)CATSV by a 405-bp HinfI fragment containing the human CC10 promoter sequences from −395 to +10 (25Wolf M. Klug J. Hackenberg R. Gessler M. Grzeschik K.H. Beato M. Suske G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An appropriate rat CC10 promoter-CAT construct (ratCC10-CATSV) was obtained by cloning a 350-bpHpaII fragment containing rat CC10 sequences from −300 to +60 (26Hagen G. Wolf M. Katyal S.L. Singh G. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2939-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) into the blunted BamHI site of pUG(−395)CATSV. During the course of our experimental studies, we recloned the various uteroglobin/CC10 promoters and linker-scanning mutants thereof asHindIII-XhoI fragments into the luciferase reporter vector pGAW, which is a self-made derivative of the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). In pGAW the single BamHI site of pGL3 is destroyed by blunt end religation and the polylinker of pGL3 is replaced by a polylinker containing single recognition sequences for the restriction enzymes PstI, EcoRI,EcoRV, HindIII, BamHI,BglII, XhoI, SmaI, NheI,SacI, and KpnI. The luciferase reporter plasmids were used for transfections in Drosophila Schneider cells (SL2 cells). The mammalian expression plasmids for TTF-1, HNF3α, HNF3β, and HFH-4 were generous gifts of R. DiLauro (CMV-TTF-1) and R. H. Costa (CMV-HNF3α, CMV-HNF3β, and CMV-HFH-4). Transcription factor expression in Drosophila Schneider cells was driven by the Drosophila actin 5C 5′-flanking region, and the constructs were generated as follows. The plasmids pPacHNF3α, pPacHNF3β, and pPacTTF-1 were obtained by cloning 1.6-kilobase pair EcoRI fragments from CMV-HNF3α or CMV-HNF3β or a 1.4-kilobase pairHindIII-XbaI fragment from CMV-TTF-1 into pPac (supplied by R. Paro, ZMBH Heidelberg) via BamHI linkers. The expression plasmids for human Sp3 (pPacUSp3 in Ref. 27Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), Sp1 (pPacSp1), and Sp1 derivatives have been described (27Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 28Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 29Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The Sp1 and Oct-1 expression plasmids pPacSp1 and pPacOct-1 were generously provided by R. Tjian and C. Möws, respectively. Nuclear extracts of mammalian and transfected SL2 cells were prepared according to Andrews and Faller (30Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for EMSAs are presented in the appropriate figures. After annealing of the single-stranded oligonucleotides the double-stranded DNA was separated from unannealed strands by gel electrophoresis on a native 12% polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Double-stranded DNA was labeled by filling in the ends with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow fragment (20 ng of DNA in 20 μl). Labeled DNA was separated from free [α-32P]dCTP by filtration through ProbeQuant G-50 Micro Columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). EMSAs were performed by preincubating 1–3 μl of nuclear extract with 1.5 μg of unspecific competitor poly(dI-dC) in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 8.5% glycerol for 10 min on ice. Subsequently, 0.1 ng of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to a final volume of 20 μl, and samples were incubated for another 20 min on ice. Antisera used for supershift assays were described previously (αSp1 and αSp3 in Ref. 31Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) or generously provided by C. Scheidereit (αOct-1), R. DiLauro (αTTF-1), and W. Schmid and G. Schütz (αHNF3α and αHNF3β). Usually, 1 μl of the appropriate antiserum was added to the binding reaction, and incubation was continued at room temperature for another 20 min. In the case of αOct-1, the antiserum was added prior to the labeled oligonucleotide, because the antiserum prevents binding of Oct-1 to DNA. 2C. Scheidereit, personal communication. For competition experiments, unlabeled oligonucleotides were added in excess before the labeled oligonucleotide was added. Samples were analyzed on 4% native polyacrylamide gels in 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1.6 mm EDTA. Gels were transferred to Whatman no. 3MM paper, dried under heat and vacuum, and exposed to x-ray films overnight. Ishikawa cells were grown as monolayers in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The human lung adenocarcinoma cell-line H441 was maintained in RPMI medium containing 4% fetal calf serum. SL2 cells (32Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Schneider medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (insect cell qualified; Life Technologies, Inc.) at 25 °C. All media were supplemented with l-glutamine and antibiotics. Ishikawa cells were transfected on 60-mm dishes at 50–70% confluence by the DEAE-dextran method as described (27Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) with 6–8 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.5–3 μg of expression vector and 2 μg of RSV-Luc or RSV-βgal plasmids as internal controls. H441 cells were transfected on 35 mm dishes at 50–70% confluence by using 2 μl of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 2 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.5–1 μg of expression vector, and 2 μg of RSV-Luc, RSV-CAT, or RSV-βgal plasmids as internal controls. SL2 cells were transfected on 60-mm dishes as described (27Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) or six-well microtiter plates using the calcium phosphate method described by DiNocera and Dawid (33DiNocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). One day prior to transfection, cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/well. Every well received 2.5 μg of DNA including 1 μg of reporter plasmid and 1 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid p97b as an internal reference. Variable amounts of expression plasmids were compensated with the plasmid pPac. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 h prior to changing media. Ishikawa and H441 cells were harvested after a total of 72 h and SL2 cells after a total of 48 h. The cells were lysed by four freeze-thaw cycles and centrifuged at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was assayed as described (34Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol and its acetylated derivatives were separated by thin-layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. The percentage of acetylation was quantitated by using a Packard System 200 imaging scanner. Expression of CAT enzymatic activity was normalized to luciferase or β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were carried out as described (35Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, Chichester, United Kingdom1997Google Scholar, 36Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from various cell lines was provided by M. Kalff-Suske. For Northern blots, the RNA was separated on 0.8% and 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 mformaldehyde and blotted to nylon membranes. Prehybridization was carried out in 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 0.1% SDS, 250 μg/ml sonicated denaturated herring sperm DNA, 25 μg/ml poly(A), and 50% formamide at 42 °C for 4 h. For hybridization, 10% dextran sulfate and appropriate 32P-labeled cDNA probes for SP A, SP B, SP C, uteroglobin/CC10, TTF-1, HNF3α, HNF3β, and HFH-4 (specific activity of 1 × 109 cpm/μg) were included prior to overnight incubation. Control hybridizations of 18 S ribosomal RNA have been performed as described (37Szyf M. Milstone D.S. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. Seidman J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using a32P-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotide probe that has the sequence 5′-ACGGTATCTGATCGTCTTCGAACC-3′. To identify cell lines that express lung epithelium-specific marker genes, we performed Northern blot analysis of RNA from different human lung cell lines. As a negative control, we used RNA from Ishikawa cells, a cell line derived from an endometrium tumor (Fig. 1). Surfactant protein A and B (SP A and SP B) mRNAs were present exclusively in H441 cells whereas surfactant protein C mRNA was not detectable in any of the cell lines (data not shown). Human uteroglobin/CC10 mRNA was expressed in H441 cells, in addition to H60 and H69 cells (Fig. 1 A). This finding was surprising inasmuch as it has been reported previously that H441 cells do not express the Clara cell marker protein CC10 gene (16Ray M.K. Chen C.-Y. Schwartz R.J. DeMayo F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2056-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Stripp B.R. Huffman J.A. Bohinski R.J. Genomics. 1994; 20: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the transcription factors TTF-1 and members of the HNF3/forkhead family of transcription factors are involved in SP A, SP B, and uteroglobin/CC10 gene expression. Thus, we also analyzed the expression pattern of the TTF-1, HNF3α, HNF3β, and HFH-4 genes (Fig. 1 B). TTF-1 mRNA was present in H441, H661, and H69 cells with the highest amount in H441 cells. HNF3α mRNA was detected in H441, A549, 32M1, and H60 cells and HNF3β mRNA in A549 and H69 cells. In none of the cell lines was HFH-4 mRNA detectable (data not shown). Taken together, H441 cells, which express three different lung epithelial marker genes (SP A, SP B, and uteroglobin/CC10), coexpress TTF-1 and HNF3α but not HNF3β and HFH-4 mRNA. Since H441 cells expressed uteroglobin/CC10 as well as TTF-1 and HNF3α, we asked whether TTF-1 and members of the HNF3/forkhead family of transcription factors could activate transcription from the uteroglobin/CC10 promoters of various species. The promoters of the rat, human, and rabbit uteroglobin/CC10 genes were fused to the CAT gene and cotransfected along with CMV promoter-driven expression constructs for TTF-1, HNF3α, HNF3β, and HFH-4 into Ishikawa cells lacking these transcription factors (see Fig. 1 B). TTF-1 enhanced transcription from the rat uteroglobin/CC10 promoter up to 18-fold but had essentially no influence on the homologous human and rabbit gene promoters (Fig. 2). In contrast, both HNF3α and HNF3β stimulated transcription from all three homologous uteroglobin/CC10 promoters up to 8-fold. Cotransfection of an HFH-4 expression plasmid did not alter uteroglobin/CC10 promoter activities (Fig. 2). Thus, it appears that TTF-1 can activate the uteroglobin/CC10 promoter only in certain species. HNF3α and HNF3β, however, can stimulate uteroglobin/CC10 promoters from all species tested. These results suggest that the presence of HNF3α or HNF3β in respiratory epithelial cells is indispensable for the expression of uteroglobin/CC10 genes in mammals. To identify the promoter elements in the rabbit uteroglobin/CC10 promoter responsible for the activation by HNF3α and HNF3β, we cotransfected a series of 5′-promoter deletion-CAT constructs (7Suske G. Lorenz W. Klug J. Gazdar A.F. Beato M. Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 339-352PubMed Google Scholar) along with the expression constructs for HNF3α and HNF3β in Ishikawa cells (Fig. 3). Promoter deletion mutants with 5′ end points at −395, −220, −205, −177, and −159 were all activated by HNF3α and HNF3β. Promoter mutants that contain only 96 or 35 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site, however, were not stimulated by these two transcription factors. Thus, the DNA elements that are essential for stimulation by HNF3α and HNF3β lie within −159 bp and −96 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Close inspection of this region revealed two A/T-rich sequence stretches (previously designated elements III and IV) (7Suske G. Lorenz W. Klug J. Gazdar A.F. Beato M. Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 339-352PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4), which coincide with the consensus sequence of HNF3α and HNF3β binding sites (VAWTRTTKRYTY) (39Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Moreover, these A/T-rich sequences are conserved between the corresponding uteroglobin/CC10 promoter regions of human, rat, and mouse. Consequently, we tested whether these two A/T-rich regions are responsible for activation of the promoter by HNF3α or HNF3β. For this purpose, linker-scanning mutants that destroy either the distal (LS(−127/−132)), the proximal (LS(−92/−99)), or both sequence elements (DLS(−92/−127)) were cotransfected along with HNF3α or HNF3β. Mutation of the proximal A/T-rich region (in LS(−92/−99)) reduced inducibility of the uteroglobin/CC10 promoter approximately 2-fold. Mutations in the linker-scanning mutant LS(−127/−132) and in the double mutant DLS(−92/−127) completely abolished the inducibility by HNF3α and HNF3β (Fig. 4). These results show that both A/T-rich elements are necessary for full promoter activation by HNF3α and HNF3β; however, the distal element appears to be more important. The experiments described so far were performed with Ishikawa cells. In similar cotransfection experiments with H441 cells, we could not detect a significant activation of the rabbit CC10/uteroglobin promoter by HNF3α and HNF3β. This observation is likely due to the presence of high levels of endogenous HNF3α (Fig. 1; see below). However, transfection of the wild-type promoter and the linker-scanning mutants LS(−92/−99), LS(−127/−132), and DLS(−92/−127) revealed that both elements are necessary for full promoter activity in H441 cells (Fig. 5). Mutation of either the distal or proximal HNF3-responsive element (in LS(−127/−132) and LS(−92/−99)) reduced promoter activity 2–3-fold. Mutation of both elements (in DLS(−92/−127)) diminished promoter activity at least 5-fold. We next asked whether the nuclear protein in H441 cells that binds to the HNF3-responsive elements is indeed HNF3α or whether additional transcription factors may recognize these elements. EMSA experiments were performed with crude nuclear extracts from H441 cells and oligonucleotides containing either the distal or the proximal HNF3-responsive element (oligonucleotides OEIV and OEIII in Fig. 6 A). Two specific complexes, a strong fast migrating complex and a weak slow migrating complex, were observed when we used the OEIV oligonucleotide as probe (Fig. 6 B). Essentially the same migration pattern was observed with the OEIII oligonucleotide (Fig. 6 C). Both bands were specifically competed with oligonucleotides containing elements III or IV, but not with an unspecific oligonucleotide or an oligonucleotide that contained the same mutations as in the linker-scanning mutants (Fig. 6, B and C). Moreover, oligonucleotides containing the mutations present in the linker-scanning mutants LS(−127/−132) and LS(−92/−99) did not bind any nuclear protein from H441 cells (Fig. 6 D). In the presence of an HNF3α antiserum, the strong fast migrating complex was shifted (Fig. 6 E, lane 4). Antisera against HNF3β and HNF3γ did not affect migration of the complex (data not shown). Thus, the major transcription factor in H441 cells binding to elements IV and III is HNF3α. Previous experiments showed that elements III and IV can also bind octamer transcription factors in vitro. 3H. Braun and G. Suske, unpublished results. Therefore, we tested whether the slow migrating complex could be Oct-1. When an anti-Oct-1 serum raised against the DNA-binding domain was present in the binding reaction, the slow migrating complex disappeared, but the fast migrating complex was unaltered (Fig. 6 E, lane 6). If antisera against HNF3α and Oct-1 were present in the binding reaction (Fig. 6 E, αH/O, lane 7), both bands disappeared. In the presence of the Oct-1 antiserum, fast migrating complexes appeared, which probably reflect proteolytic degradation products of the Oct-1 protein bound by antibodies. Nevertheless, this experiment demonstrated that other factors distinct from HNF3α and Oct-1, which may bind to element III and IV, are not present in nuclear extracts from H441 cells, suggesting that HNF3α and/or Oct-1 are responsible for the transcriptional activity of both promoter elements in H441 cells. An oligonucleotide spanning the uteroglobin/CC10 promoter sequence from −86 to −139 (OEIII/IV in Fig. 6 A) and thus spanning both HNF3/Oct-1 sites was also used in EMSAs (Fig. 6, F and G). These experiments revealed that other transcription factors binding to this promoter region are not present in H441 cells. Notably, the HNF3α-containing complex obtained with the OEIII/IV oligonucleotide migrated much faster compared with the complexes obtained with the short OEIII or OEIV oligonucleotides (Fig. 6 G, compare lanes 1 and 8). It is likely that this behavior is due to bending of the DNA by HNF3α (40Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) and might have mechanistic implications for promoter activation (see “Discussion”). To further substantiate the conclusion that HNF3α and HNF3β or Oct-1, but not TTF-1, contribute to the level of transcription from the rabbit uteroglobin/CC10 promoter in lung, we performed gene transfer experiments into the Drosophila melanogaster Schneider cell line (SL2 cells) that lacks many mammalian transcription factor activities (Fig. 7). For these experiments, luciferase constructs instead of CAT reporter constructs that we generated in the course of our studies were used. The uteroglobin/CC10 promoter fused to the luciferase gene was cotransfected along with plasmids expressing Oct-1, TTF-1, HNF3α, or HNF3β, specifically designed for insect cells (pPacOct-1, pPacTTF-1, pPacHNF3α, and pPacHNF3β). Cotransfection of pPacOct-1 along with the uteroglobin/CC10-luciferase gene led to a 2–3-fold increase of luciferase activity. As expected, TTF-1 did not activate the uteroglobin/CC10 promoter, confirming the results of the cotransfection experiments obtained with mammalian cell lines. Surprisingly, HNF3α"

These mediators augment expression of a reporter gene driven by the murine, but not the human, P-selectin promoter in transfected endothelial cells. The regions from −593 to −474 and from −229 to −13 in the murine P-selectin promoter are required for TNF-α or LPS to stimulate reporter gene expression. Within these regions, we identified two tandem κB elements, a reverse-oriented κB site and a variant activating transcription factor/cAMP response element (ATF/CRE), that participate in TNF-α- or LPS-induced expression. The tandem κB elements bound to NF-κB heterodimers and p65 homodimers, the reverse-oriented κB site bound to p65 homodimers, and the variant ATF/CRE bound to nuclear proteins that included activating transcription factor-2. Mutations in each individual element eliminated binding to nuclear proteins and decreased by 20–60% the TNF-α- or LPS-induced expression of a reporter gene driven by the murine P-selectin promoter in transfected endothelial cells. Simultaneous mutations of all elements further decreased, but did not abolish, induced expression. Co-overexpression of p50 and p65 enhanced murine P-selectin promoter activity in a κB site-dependent manner. These data indicate that the κB sites and the variant ATF/CRE are required for TNF-α or LPS to optimally induce expression of the murine P-selectin gene.

The best characterized transcription factors regulated by signaling through TNF-α and LPS are NF-κB/Rel proteins and proteins activated by MAP kinases.In mammals, the NF-κB/Rel family includes NF-κB1 (p50), NF-κB2 (p52), RelA (p65), c-Rel, and RelB (13Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding forms of NF-κB/Rel proteins are homodimers or heterodimers that recognize decameric κB elements. Most κB elements have incomplete dyad symmetry and have a characteristic 5′ to 3′ orientation relative to the transcriptional start site. The prototypical NF-κB heterodimer (p50/p65) recognizes κB elements with the consensus 5′-GGGRNNYYCC-3′. However, some variant κB sites are recognized only by specific homodimeric or heterodimeric combinations of NF-κB/Rel proteins (14Parry G.C. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20823-20825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23077-23083Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Kunsch C. Ruben S.M.

The p65-containing dimers are retained in the cytoplasm through complex formation with IκBα and related proteins. Upon cellular stimulation by TNF-α or LPS, IκB-α is degraded. Dimers containing p65 then migrate into the nucleus and activate many genes with κB elements, including the gene encoding IκB-α (18De Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H.

ATF-2 is a member of the ATF/cAMP response element binding protein family of transcription factors; it functions as homodimers or heterodimers that recognize an 8-bp variant ATF/CRE site (5′-TGACATCA-3′) (27Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 28Kaszubska W. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Ghersa P. DeRaemy-Schenk A.-M. Chen B.P.C. Hai T.

Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ATF-2 and c-Jun proteins enhances the abilities of dimeric complexes, notably ATF-2/c-Jun and c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers, to activate transcription (24Gupta S. Campbell D.

Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar).The pathways for activation of NF-κB/Rel proteins and JNK/p38 MAP kinases are evolutionarily conserved from insects to mammals (30Hoffman J.A.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2745-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). TNF-α and LPS also generally use conserved pathways to activate a specific gene. For example, the LPS response element of the tissue factor promoter contains two AP1 sites and a κB site that are conserved in at least four different mammals (11Mackman N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). TNF-α-induced expression of the E-selectin gene is mediated by an enhanceosome that contains three κB sites, a variant ATF/CRE, and four A/T-rich sequences that bind to the architectural HMG I(Y) proteins (32Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Read M.A. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6464-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 33Lewis H. Kaszubska W. Delamarter J.F. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All these elements are required for TNF-α or LPS to maximally induce transcription, and they are conserved in both the human and murine E-selectin genes (34Becker-Andre M. Van Huijsduijnen R.H. Losberger C. Whelan J. Delamarter F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).By contrast, TNF-α or LPS increases expression of the P-selectin gene in murine endothelial cells but not in human endothelial cells (35Sanders W.E.

In the preceding paper (38Pan J. Xia L. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10058-10067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that these mediators augment expression of a reporter gene driven by the murine, but not the human, P-selectin promoter in transfected endothelial cells. Furthermore, the sequences from −593 to −474 and from −229 to −13 in the murine P-selectin promoter are required for TNF-α or LPS to stimulate expression of the reporter gene (38Pan J. Xia L. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10058-10067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To dissect the molecular basis for this unusual species-specific gene activation event, we employed pharmacologic agents, DNA-binding experiments, transfection studies, and mutational analysis to characterize the regulatory elements and their cognate proteins that contribute to TNF-α- or LPS-induced expression of the murine P-selectin gene. We identified two tandem κB sites, a reverse-oriented κB site and a variant ATF/CRE, that participate in TNF-α- or LPS-induced expression. These elements are not present in the corresponding regions of the human P-selectin gene, which may account in part for the species-specific response of the P-selectin gene to TNF-α or LPS.DISCUSSIONWe identified and characterized two tandem κB sites, a reverse-oriented κB site and a variant ATF/CRE site, that are required for TNF-α or LPS to optimally induce expression of the murine P-selectin gene. The presence of these elements in the murine, but not human, P-selectin gene may help explain why TNF-α or LPS increases expression of P-selectin in murine, but not in human, endothelial cells.In contrast to the unique κB site in the human P-selectin gene that binds p50 or p52 homodimers (15Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23077-23083Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 42Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the three κB sites in the murine gene bind inducible p65-containing NF-κB/Rel proteins. The unique κB site in the human gene is required for optimal constitutive expression of a reporter gene in transfected endothelial cells (15Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23077-23083Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, the three κB sites in the murine gene are important for TNF-α- or LPS-inducible gene expression but not for constitutive expression. The interactions of p50 or p52 homodimers with the proto-oncoprotein, Bcl-3, regulate the activity of the human κB site (15Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23077-23083Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), whereas p65-containing NF-κB/Rel proteins regulate the activity of the three murine κB sites. These findings indicate that distinct members of the NF-κB/Rel family proteins regulate transcription of the murine and human P-selectin genes. The binding of newly synthesized IκBα to p65-containing NF-κB/Rel proteins may explain the post-inductional repression of reporter gene expression driven by the murine P-selectin promoter. The stabilization of IκBα by the proteasome inhibitor ALLN or the antioxidant PDTC may prevent TNF-α- or LPS-induced expression of P-selectin mRNA in murine endothelial cells. In contrast, the translational inhibitors cycloheximide or anisomycin may superinduce expression by preventing the resynthesis of IκBα.The two tandem κB elements in the murine P-selectin gene bind avidly to NF-κB heterodimers and p65 homodimers, although they lack the typical consensus sequence for binding to NF-κB/Rel proteins (13Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar,16Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the tandem κB elements have striking sequence similarity to the two tandem κB sites in the human or murine E-selectin genes (32Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Read M.A. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6464-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 33Lewis H. Kaszubska W. Delamarter J.F. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Becker-Andre M. Van Huijsduijnen R.H. Losberger C. Whelan J. Delamarter F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 52Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences flanking or overlapping the κB elements in the E-selectin gene and the murine P-selectin gene have at least three A/T-rich sequences for binding to the architectural HMG I(Y) proteins (53Solomon M.J. Strauss F. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In the E-selectin gene, binding of HMG I(Y) proteins to the A/T-rich sequences enhances binding of NF-κB heterodimers to the κB sites and facilitates interaction of NF-κB heterodimers with ATF-2/c-Jun proteins that bind to an adjacent ATF/CRE. These interactions contribute to formation of a highly organized enhanceosome (2Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 32Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Read M.A. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6464-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 33Lewis H. Kaszubska W. Delamarter J.F. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy, the binding of HMG I(Y) proteins to A/T-rich sequences in the murine P-selectin gene may enhance binding of NF-κB to the tandem P-selectin κB sites and may facilitate binding of NF-κB to the weak κB element located 13 base pairs 3′ to the tandem κB sites. Proteins binding to the P-selectin tandem κB sites and the A/T-rich sequences may also cooperate with other transcription factors to form an enhanceosome.The reverse-oriented κB site in the murine P-selectin gene binds preferentially to p65 homodimers and is required for optimal TNF-α- or LPS-induced expression of a reporter gene driven by the murine P-selectin promoter. To our knowledge, this is the first reported example of an asymmetric κB element with an opposite orientation relative to the transcriptional start site. This element may function because it binds to symmetrical p65 homodimers that do not require a specifically oriented κB sequence to transactivate gene expression. The identification of this unusual κB site further supports the notion that p65 homodimers and NF-κB heterodimers have distinct biological functions (54Sha W.C. Liou H.C. Tuomanen E.I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 55Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D.

Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar).Mutation of the variant ATF/CRE in the murine P-selectin gene eliminated binding to ATF-2 and other nuclear proteins, and it also decreased the TNF-α- or LPS-induced expression of a reporter gene driven by the murine P-selectin promoter. This suggests that activation of the JNK/p38 MAP kinases, which phosphorylate ATF-2, is required for TNF-α or LPS to optimally induce expression of P-selectin. Combined mutations of the κB sites and the variant ATF/CRE further decreased, but did not abolish, the TNF-α- or LPS-inducible expression, indicating that other regulatory elements also participate. Candidate elements include three putative AP1 sites identified in the preceding paper (38Pan J. Xia L. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10058-10067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and the low affinity κB site identified in this study. Deletional analysis did not reveal a role for these elements in TNF-α- or LPS-inducible expression of the murine P-selectin reporter gene. However, deletions may alter other regulatory elements that modulate the function of the deleted element.TNF-α and LPS use strikingly similar mechanisms to induce expression of the murine P-selectin gene (this study) and the human and murine E-selectin genes (2Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Both genes use κB sites and a variant ATF/CRE to transmit signals received from extracellular stimuli. The use of two or more signal-regulated elements may allow optimal adjustment of gene expression in response to a variety of challenges (12Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). The similar pathways by which TNF-α and LPS regulate the E-selectin gene and the murine P-selectin gene are consistent with the origin of the selectin gene family by gene duplication (57Watson M.L. Kingsmore S.F. Johnston G.I. Siegelman M.H. Le Beau M.M. Lemons R.S. Bora N.S. Howard T.A. Weissman I.L. McEver R.P. Seldin M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This may partially explain the overlapping functions of P-selectin and E-selectin in the mouse (58Labow M.A. Norton C.R. Rumberger J.M. Lombard-Gillooly K.M. Shuster D.J. Hubbard J. Bertko R. Knaack P.A. Terry R.W. Harbison M.L. Kontgen F. Stewart C.L. McIntyre K.L. Burns D.K.

It also predicts that agents such as ultraviolet light and IL-1β, which activate NF-κB or JNK/p38 kinases (2Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar), will stimulate expression of the murine, but not the human, P-selectin gene.Our studies have the inherent limitation that cultured endothelial cells may not contain the same transcription factors and signaling proteins found in microvascular endothelial cells in vivo. However, TNF-α or LPS clearly augments expression of both P- and E-selectin in murine endothelial cells in vivo (35Sanders W.E. Wilson R.W. Ballantyne C.M. Beaudet A.L. Blood. 1992; 80: 795-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Weller A. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15176-15183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Hahne M. Jäger U.

Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 2: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). By contrast, intradermal injection of LPS increases expression of E-selectin, but not P-selectin, in venules of non-human primates (63Silber A. Newman W. Reimann K.A. Hendricks E. Walsh D. Ringler D.J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 163-175PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, E-selectin mRNA levels increase in the atria of patients after cardiopulmonary bypass, whereas P-selectin mRNA levels decline (64Burns S.A. DeGuzman B.J. Newburger J.W. Mayer Jr., J.E. Neufeld E.J. Briscoe D.M. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 1995; 110: 924-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These in vivo studies further support a species-specific response of the P-selectin gene to TNF-α, LPS, or related mediators. Thus, the mechanisms for regulating the inducible transcription of the P-selectin gene appear to have evolved from mice to humans. This species-specific fine tuning of gene expression may extend to other inflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules. For example, either IL-4 or oncostatin M induces expression of P-selectin in murine and human endothelial cells. But induced expression in human cells is delayed and requires new protein synthesis, whereas induced expression in murine cells is more rapid and does not require new protein synthesis (37Yao L. Pan J. Setiadi H. Patel K.D. McEver R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). 2L. Yao and R. P. McEver, unpublished observations. IL-4 suppresses the TNF-α-inducible expression of E-selectin in human endothelial cells (65Thornhill M.H. Haskard D.O. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 865-872PubMed Google Scholar). IL-4 prevents E-selectin expression by activating Stat6, which binds to a DNA element that overlaps one of the κB sites in the human E-selectin gene, thereby competitively inhibiting binding of NF-κB (66Bennett B.L. Cruz R. Lacson R.G. Manning A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10212-10219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The Stat6 element, however, is not conserved in the murine E-selectin gene (34Becker-Andre M. Van Huijsduijnen R.H. Losberger C. Whelan J. Delamarter F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that IL-4 may not suppress TNF-α-inducible expression of E-selectin in mice. Therefore, distinct mechanisms may be used to regulate expression of selectin genes in different species.Our results also suggest that the function assigned to a selectin in a particular animal model may not necessarily apply to humans. In many rodent models of inflammation, tissue injury or other insults generate thrombin, histamine, oxygen-derived radicals, or other mediators that stimulate endothelial cells to redistribute P-selectin from Weibel-Palade bodies to the cell surface (67Albelda S.M. Smith C.W. Ward P.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 68Sharar S.R. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1995; 16: 359-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 69McEver R.P. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Depending on the specific challenge, TNF-α, IL-β, or LPS may also be elaborated. These agents cause murine endothelial cells to increase synthesis of P-selectin, which may travel directly to the cell surface if the machinery that sorts proteins into Weibel-Palade bodies is saturated. Some models may induce expression of other cytokines such as IL-4 and oncostatin M, which can also increase synthesis of P-selectin. The relative contributions of these distinct pathways of inducible expression may be difficult to distinguish in vivo. Our data suggest that mediators that activate p65-containing NF-κB dimers or ATF-2-containing dimers may increase transcription of the P-selectin gene in rodents, but not in humans. Close scrutiny of the mechanisms for inducing P-selectin expression in animal models may be necessary to interpret the relevance of the findings for human biology.

CooJ is a CO-induced protein predicted to contain a nickel binding motif composed of 16 histidine residues in the final 34 amino acids of the 12.5-kDa protein. When cells grown in the presence of CO were fractionated on an immobilized metal affinity chromatography column and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the major protein observed in the effluent migrated at an apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa. The 19-kDa protein was absent in extracts of cells grown in the absence of CO and the mutant strain, UR294, which lacks a functionalcooJ gene. N-terminal sequence analysis confirmed that the 19-kDa protein is the product of the cooJ gene. Purified CooJ was shown to bind four nickel atoms per CooJ monomer with aKd of 4.3 μm. Other divalent metals competed with the following order of affinity and correspondingKi: Zn2+ (5 μm) > Cd2+ (19 μm) > Co2+ (23 μm) > Cu2+ (122 μm).

In the presence of CO, the CooA regulatory protein recognizes CO and binds to the promoter regions of the cooFSCTJ and cooMKLXUH operons, initiating the expression of the CO oxidation system (2Fox J.D.

CODH contains two metal clusters: an oxygen-labile, nickel-iron-sulfur cluster referred to as the C cluster and a Fe4S4 cluster referred to as the B cluster (6Hu Z. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J.

The electrons liberated by the oxidation of CO are transferred to a ferredoxin-like protein, the cooF product (CooF), and then through an undefined path to the CO-tolerant hydrogenase (CooH), which uses the electrons to evolve H2(8Ensign S.A.

The cooFSCTJ operon contains the genes encoding CODH (cooS) and CooF (cooF), as well as three downstream genes, cooCTJ, that show sequence similarity to some of the nickel-processing genes required for metallocluster assembly in urease and hydrogenase (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Physiological characterization of mutants containing polar or nonpolar insertions into the cooCTJ genes produced results consistent with a role in nickel processing for these gene products (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CooC gene product is predicted to contain a nucleotide binding domain (P-loop) and is similar to the UreG and HypB proteins that are involved in processing nickel for urease and hydrogenase (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CooJ contains a nickel binding motif in the C terminus with 16 histidine residues in the final 34 amino acids. Nickel binding motifs have been found in the predicted amino acid sequences of most HypB and UreE proteins (12Maier T. Böck A. Hausinger R.P. Eichhorn G.L. Marzilli L.G. 1st Ed.

CooT shows no significant similarity to proteins in the sequence data base, and its role in nickel cluster assembly is unknown. Although the active sites of urease, hydrogenase, and CODH are not similar (6Hu Z. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem.

Science. 1995; 268: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), the processing of nickel for each of these enzymes appears to have a common requirement for proteins containing a P-loop and a histidine-rich region. The CooJ protein shares sequence similarity to UreE both in the histidine-rich C terminus and in other domains of the protein (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UreE has been purified by IMAC from several organisms (17Lee M.H. Pankratz H.S. Wang S. Scott R.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6836-6841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been implicated in the accumulation of nickel for urease (19Brayman T.G. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Brayman and Hausinger (19Brayman T.G. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that a truncated version of UreE (H144* UreE), which lacks the the histidine-rich C-terminal region, still binds approximately 2 Ni2+atoms/dimer and appears to function in vivo. Organisms that have high affinity uptake systems for nickel have UreE-like proteins that lack the histidine-rich region, leading to the suggestion that the histidine-rich region functions to store nickel ions (19Brayman T.G. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HypB protein is involved in maturation of hydrogenase, and it contains domains with sequence similarity to CooC (P-loop) and CooJ (histidine-rich region) (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of the Escherichia coli hypB gene, which lacks the histidine-rich region (20Lutz S. Jacobi A. Schlensog V. Bohm R. Sawers G. Bock A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). HypB proteins have been purified and characterized fromE. coli (21Maier T. Jacobi A. Sauter M. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 630-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Rhizobium leguminosarum (22Rey L. Imperial J. Placios J.-M. Ruiz-Argüeso J.

The histidine-rich region of HypB has been shown to store nickel inB. japonicum (26Olson J.W. Fu C. Maier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this work, we report the identification, purification, and characterization of the nickel-binding protein, CooJ, from R. rubrum. The purification of wild type CooJ was complicated by the co-purification of CODH and several other proteins until detergent and chaotropic agents separated CooJ from these proteins. The characteristics of CooJ are compared with the analogous nickel-processing proteins from the hydrogenase and urease nickel-processing systems. CooJ binds nickel and other divalent metals with comparable affinity and selectivity as reported for HypB and UreE. The native molecular composition of CooJ shows some similarity to HypB from R. leguminosarum because it appears to multimerize (22Rey L. Imperial J. Placios J.-M. Ruiz-Argüeso J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6066-6073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this observation differs from the dimeric stiochiometry reported for most HypB and UreE proteins. All work was performed under anaerobic conditions unless otherwise stated because of the oxygen lability of several of the coo gene products. The following buffers were used for the IMAC column: binding buffer, 20 mm Tris with 1.0 mNaCl and 5 mm imidazole, pH 8.0; wash buffer, 20 mm Tris with 1.0 m NaCl and 60 mmimidazole, pH 8.0; elute buffer, 20 mm Tris with 1.0m NaCl and 500 mm imidazole, pH 8.0; strip buffer, 20 mm Tris with 1.0 m NaCl and 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0; chaotropic buffer, 0.5% CHAPS and 1.0m NaBr in 85 mm imidazole buffer, pH 8.0. The 1.0 m NaCl was omitted from the elute buffer when the fraction was to be loaded onto the Source 15Q ion exchange column. The R. rubrum strain UR2 (a spontaneous streptomycin-resistant mutant of R. rubrum UR1 (ATCC 11170)) was used as the wild type strain. R. rubrum strain UR294 contains a kanamycin resistance cassette in cooC that is polar onto cooT and cooJ (1Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2241-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nickel binding motif of CooJ (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) made it a candidate for binding to an IMAC column (27Porath J. Carlsson J. Olsson I. Belfrage G. Nature. 1975; 258: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). Cultures of wild type R. rubrum (strain UR2) or mutant strain UR294 were cultured in 0.5 liter of Ormerod's medium (28Ormerod J.G. Ormerod K.S. Gest H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 94: 449-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) with NH4Cl as the nitrogen source in the presence or absence of CO in the head-space. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g. The cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen until cells were used. Cell paste was thawed anaerobically in 0.1m MOPS buffer, pH 8.0, and broken in a French pressure cell. The crude extract was fractionated by centrifugation at 42,000 × g for 2 h. The supernatant from the centrifugation was loaded onto a 2-ml IMAC column (His-bind, Novagen), which was equilibrated with 25 ml of binding buffer. After loading, the IMAC column was washed with 25 ml of binding buffer, 15 ml of wash buffer, 15 ml of elute buffer, and 15 ml of strip buffer. Fractions from each wash were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 15% acrylamide gel (29Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7113) Google Scholar). A protein band that appeared under conditions consistent with cooJ expression was submitted for N-terminal sequencing to confirm the identification. R. rubrum(strain UR2) was grown in 20-liter cultures under a CO atmosphere in either the presence or absence of nickel as described previously (30Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cell paste (100 g) was thawed anaerobically in 100 ml of 0.1m MOPS, pH 8.0, and cells were broken in a French pressure cell. The crude extract was fractionated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 h. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1 × 8-cm IMAC column equilibrated in wash buffer. The column was washed with the following buffers: 40 ml of wash buffer, 50 ml of chaotropic buffer, 50 ml of 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and 15 ml of elute buffer. CooJ eluted in the elute buffer wash. EDTA was added to the fraction containing CooJ to a final concentration of 1 mm. CooJ was loaded onto an HR10 Source Q fast protein liquid chromatography column equilibrated with anaerobic 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. The column was washed with 50 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and then eluted with a linear gradient from 50 to 500 mm NaCl. CooJ eluted in fractions containing 200–500 mm NaCl. The purest fractions (as determined by SDS-PAGEs) were pooled for use. The apparent subunit molecular mass of CooJ in SDS-PAGE gels was calculated by comparison to standard proteins bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and cytochrome c(12.5 kDa). The native molecular mass was determined using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superose 12 gel filtration column on an LKB HPLC. The column was standardized by recording the elution volumes of the standard proteins listed above. CooJ was prepared for mass spectrometry by exchanging the buffer with 0.010 m Tris, pH 8.0, using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech PD-10 column. The samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption using a Shimadzu Kratos Kompact MALDI 4, Version 5.0.1. Nickel binding to CooJ was determined by equilibrium dialysis using the dialysis chambers described by Reinard and Jacobsen (31Reinard T. Jacobsen H.-J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), except that Sarstadt microcentrifuge tubes were used in place of Eppendorf tubes. Spectropore 4 membranes, with a nominal 12,000–14,000 molecular weight cutoff, were prepared by boiling in 0.1 mNaHCO3 and 1 mm EDTA to remove traces of metal and sulfur from the membrane. CooJ did not pass through the membrane. Each tube contained 600 μl of total volume, with 300 μl each in the upper and lower chambers. The lower chamber contained CooJ (5 μm), and the upper chamber contained 0.4 μCi of63Ni (788 mCi/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) with the indicated concentration of unlabeled nickel. All solutions were prepared in 0.05 m Tris, pH 8.0. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for 24 h, after which the solution from each side of the membrane was collected, and the amount of 63Ni in each was determined by liquid scintillation counting using the14C setting in a Packard Minaxi Tricarb 4000 series scintillation counter. The values obtained for nickel binding to CooJ were the same when equilibrium dialysis was performed aerobically or anaerobically; therefore, the majority of the equilibrium dialysis measurements were performed aerobically. Competition dialysis was performed by adding MnCl2, CoCl2, ZnCl2, CuCl2, MgSO4, or CaCl2 as indicated to the upper chamber containing 0.4 μCi of 63Ni and 4 μm unlabeled NiCl2. The lower chamber contained CooJ. The competition dialysis samples were allowed to equilibrate and were analyzed as described above. The binding constants and inhibition constants were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff method (32Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12221) Google Scholar) using the Prism program (Graphpad Graphics, Inc). Samples of CooJ were prepared for N-terminal sequencing by electrophoresis on a 15% SDS gel. The protein was then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. N-terminal sequencing was performed at the University of California-Riverside Biotechnology Instrumentation Facility. Total amino acid analysis was done at the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Facility, Yale University. The protein concentration from the amino acid analysis was standardized to the Bradford protein assay (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar) using carbonic anhydrase as a standard. The Bradford protein assay was chosen due to the observation that CooJ appeared to react with the Cu2+ in the Lowry and BCA protein assays (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18510) Google Scholar). Purified fractions of CooJ were electrophoresed on a preparative 15% SDS gel (17 cm × 15 cm × 2 mm) by pouring a stacking gel with only one well over the entire resolving gel and loading 400 μg of total protein. After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in ice-cold 0.25 m KCl to visualize the location of the protein. The protein band was cut from the gel and eluted from the polyacrylamide by grinding the acrylamide in PBS buffer. The supernatant was collected, and a sample was reanalyzed by SDS-PAGE to confirm that pure CooJ was obtained. This sample was used for antibody preparation at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Animal Care Unit Polyclonal Anitbody Service. Immunoblot analysis was used to estimate the amount of CooJ present in each fraction of the purification. A CooJ standard curve was prepared in each gel by loading 50, 65, 80, 95, and 110 μg of purified CooJ. The remaining wells were filled with fractions from a purification. An immunoblot was performed and developed using the ECL Western blotting protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoblot was analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI, and data analysis was performed using the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The amount of CooJ in the purification fractions was estimated by comparison to the standard curve of CooJ. The metal content of CooJ was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Perkin-Elmer 3030 graphite-furnace atomic absorption spectrometer with an HGA-300 programmer and an AS-40 auto sampler. A separate analysis was performed at the University of Wisconsin Plant and Soil Analysis Lab using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Iron analysis was done by the addition of Na2S2O4 to the CooJ sample followed by the addition of α,α′-dipyridyl and monitoring the absorbance at 520 nm. The spectrum of purified CooJ was recorded on a Shimadzu 1601PC spectrophotometer. Purified cooJ contained less than 0.1 Ni2+ atom/CooJ monomer, and all other metals were below the level of detection. CooJ was tested for binding to IMAC when denatured by urea. Solid urea was added to a final concentration of 8 m to a CooJ solution purified from the IMAC column. A 1.0-ml IMAC column was poured and equilibrated with 0.1m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris, 8 m urea, pH 8.0. CooJ was loaded and washed with 0.1m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris, 8 m urea, pH 6.3. CooJ was eluted with 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris, 8m urea, pH 4.5. Interactions between CooJ and apoCODH were tested using an IMAC column. CooJ was bound to the column and then apoCODH was loaded on the column. Controls for the individual proteins bound to the IMAC column showed that CooJ eluted in the elute buffer wash (500 mm imidazole) and purified apoCODH bound to the IMAC column and eluted in the wash buffer wash (60 mm imidazole). Purified apoCooJ was loaded onto the IMAC column, and the column was washed with binding buffer followed by loading purified apoCODH onto the column. The column was washed with wash buffer and elute buffer. The elution of the proteins was determined by SDS-PAGE. The strategy used to identify the cooJ gene product took advantage of the proposed nickel-binding capability of the histidine-rich region. ThecooJ gene encodes a polypeptide of 12.5 kDa with a nickel binding motif composed of 16 histidine residues in the final 34 amino acids (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CO-induced R. rubrum cells were lysed and centrifuged, and the crude supernatant was passed over an IMAC column. Proteins that bound to the nickel affinity column were washed from the column with elute buffer and visualized on a 15% SDS gel. CooJ was identified as the major protein band observed in the gel at an apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa (Fig. 1,lane 3). The 19-kDa protein was not observed when the identical procedure was followed with R. rubrum grown under conditions where the cooJ gene product would not be expressed, i.e. cells grown anaerobically in the absence of CO (Fig. 1, lane 1), and cells from a mutant strain (UR294) that contains an insertion into the cooC gene that is polar onto cooTJ (Fig. 1, lane 5). The addition of 10 μm nickel to the growing cells did not induce the expression of the 19-kDa protein in the absence of CO (Fig. 1,lane 2), and cells grown in the presence of CO and the absence of nickel still expressed the 19-kDa protein (Fig. 1,lane 4). N-terminal sequence analysis of the 19-kDa protein identified the first six amino acids as Thr-Glu-Ser-Pro-Glu-Arg, which is an exact match to the predicted amino acid sequence of residues 2–7 of CooJ. The N-terminal methionine was absent in the N-terminal sequencing, indicating that CooJ is posttranslationally processed. To obtain sufficient amounts of CooJ for purification, the growth conditions of R. rubrum were scaled up from 0.5-liter cultures to 20-liter cultures. For efficient induction of the coo operon, the cells were sparged with 99% CO. The first step of the purification was an IMAC column as described in the identification of CooJ (above). CooJ eluted from the IMAC column in the elute buffer wash (Fig. 2, lane 1). CooJ was observed at 19 kDa, with several additional protein bands at 38, 43, 62, and 72 kDa. This protein banding pattern is different from that shown in Fig. 1 (compare Fig. 1, lane 3, with Fig. 2, lane 1). The expression of the other proteins observed in the IMAC eluent appears to correlate with the vigorous sparging of the culture with CO. The CooJ-containing fraction from the IMAC column was chromatographed on ion exchange (DEAE and Mono Q), gel filtration (Superose 12 and G-75), and hydrophobic (phenyl-Sepharose) columns. The protein bands at 38, 43, 62, and 72 kDa co-migrated with CooJ on each of the columns tested. The co-migration of these proteins through each of these columns is indicative of a protein complex formed among these proteins. CooJ is proposed to deliver nickel to CODH; therefore, a protein complex containing CooJ might contain CODH and other proteins required for nickel insertion into CODH. An immunoblot using the anti-CODH antibody identified the protein band at 62 kDa as CODH. A CODH assay of this fraction showed a small amount of CODH activity. This fraction may represent a nickel-deficient form of CODH that requires interaction with nickel-processing proteins for full activation. CooJ was purified by binding CooJ and the copurifying proteins to the IMAC column and washing the column with chaotropic buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) to disrupt protein-protein interactions. The chaotropic buffer wash was followed by a 50 mm Tris, 85 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, wash to remove the chaotropic buffer from the column. The proteins that remained bound on the column were eluted with elute buffer. The elute buffer fraction contained CooJ without the presence of the other contaminating protein bands (Fig. 2, lane 2). CooJ was purified from any remaining impurities by chromatography on a Source Q column using a 200–500 mmNaCl gradient (Fig. 2, lane 3). The amount of CooJ present in each fraction of the purification was estimated from immunoblots of each fraction. The results of a typical purification are shown in Table I. The largest loss of CooJ during the purification was the Source Q column, where the final impurities were removed from CooJ.Table ICooJ purification tableFractionVolumeTotal protein1-aThe protein content was determined by Bradford analysis.CooJ1-bCooJ quantity was determined by scanning densitometry of an ECL-developed Western blot.Yield% CooJ in fractionPurificationmlmgmg%(mg of CooJ/ mg of protein) × 100-foldCrude extract20046003.81000.081Crude supernatant18015213.7970.243IMAC204.03.491851062Source Q171.61.436>981-cScanning densitometry showed that CooJ is greater than 98% pure after Source Q column analysis.12251-a The protein content was determined by Bradford analysis.1-b CooJ quantity was determined by scanning densitometry of an ECL-developed Western blot.1-c Scanning densitometry showed that CooJ is greater than 98% pure after Source Q column analysis. Open table in a new tab CooJ was analyzed for metal content after each chromatography step of the purification. CooJ contained 1–3 nickel atoms per monomer after the IMAC column, but treatment with EDTA prior to the Source Q column removed this nickel because CooJ contained less than 0.1 nickel atom per CooJ monomer after the Source Q column. Analysis for other divalent metals revealed that Cu2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+ were present at less than 0.05 mol of M2+per mol of CooJ monomer after the Source Q column. CooJ was analyzed for the ability to bind Ni2+ using equilibrium dialysis with the results shown in Fig. 3 A. Analysis of the binding curve showed that CooJ binds 4.2 ± 0.1 Ni2+/CooJ monomer with a kD of 4.3 ± 0.3 μm. The optimal computer fit was found using one type of binding site, suggesting that all binding sites are similar. The specificity of CooJ for nickel was tested using competition dialysis against other divalent metals (Fig. 3 B). Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ competed very poorly, whereas Cu2+, Co2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+ competed well and are listed with increasing effectiveness as inhibitors of Ni2+ binding. The calculatedKi values for the competing metals (32Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12221) Google Scholar) are as follows: Zn2+, 5 μm; Cd2+, 19 μm; Co2+, 23 μm; Cu2+, 122 μm. CooJ migrated as an apparent 19-kDa band in SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4, and Fig. 2), which is larger than the predicted molecular mass of 12.5 kDa for CooJ. Table II shows a summary of other histidine-rich proteins that were observed to migrate anomalously large in SDS-PAGE. Rey et al. (22Rey L. Imperial J. Placios J.-M. Ruiz-Argüeso J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6066-6073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that several cysteine residues in HypB from R. leguminosarum were modified and proposed that a posttranslational modification of these cysteine residues could be responsible for the anomalous migration of HypB. The possibility that the migration of CooJ at 19 kDa was caused by a posttranslational modification prompted us to look for a smaller species of CooJ that existed in an unmodified form at the predicted molecular mass of 12.5 kDa. The major contaminating protein from the IMAC column migrated at ∼12 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 2), and this 12-kDa band was absent in extracts of mutants lacking a functionalcooJ gene (data not shown). N-terminal sequence analysis of the 12-kDa protein also identified it as a cooJ product. Two possibilities explain th"

Exposure of the cells to PAF led to rapid sequestration of the receptors into the intracellular compartment and desensitization of the response to PAF. The sequestration was inhibited by pretreatments that perturbed the clathrin-mediated pathway. Subsequent removal of PAF by washing with receptor antagonists led to rapid recycling of the sequestered receptors to the cell surface accompanied by resensitization to PAF. To evaluate the potential role of phosphorylation in the receptor cytoplasmic tail during these processes, mutant receptors in which the tails were truncated or substituted, so as to lack serine/threonine residues, were created. PAF phosphorylated the wild-type receptor rapidly and strongly, but the mutants did not. The maximal extent of sequestration of each mutant was lower than that of the wild-type, and one of the substituted mutants showed no sequestration. Furthermore, the sequestration-defective mutant showed evidence of desensitization after agonist stimulation but not resensitization after agonist removal. Thus, agonist-induced phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail facilitates but is not essential for receptor sequestration, and sequestration/recycling appears important in receptor resensitization.

Exposure of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PAF, platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine); β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; PAFR, PAF receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mcPAF, 1-O-hexadecyl-2-(methylcarbamyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; WT, wild-type; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; PBS, Ca2+,Mg2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; Bt2-cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; HA, hemagglutinin. to their agonists is generally followed by a rapid desensitization of signaling. The mechanism of the desensitization involves a series of distinct steps including a functional uncoupling from G proteins and their effector systems, receptor sequestration into the intracellular compartment, and a net loss of receptors (receptor down-regulation). Among these steps, the receptor sequestration and following processes are considered to play an important role both in desensitization and resensitization of GPCRs (1Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J.

The molecular mechanisms of GPCR sequestration have been extensively studied using a β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) as the main model (1Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol.

Functional uncoupling of the β2AR from Gs proteins is a consequence of agonist-induced phosphorylation of the receptor cytoplasmic tail by the following two types of protein kinases: cAMP-dependent protein kinase and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (7Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that this phosphorylation promotes binding of β-arrestins to the β2AR and that β-arrestins subsequently act as adapters of clathrin, a major structural protein of coated pits, which suggests that β2AR sequestration is mediated by a physical interaction between receptor-associated β-arrestins and clathrin-coated pits (8Pippig S.

Despite the large amount of information concerning β2AR sequestration, much less is known of sequestration of other types of GPCRs, and available information is only fragmentary. Platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is a potent phospholipid mediator involved in the pathogenesis of allergic disorders, inflammation, anaphylactic shock, and various other physiological events (14Hanahan D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 483-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).

Repetitive or long lasting application of PAF leads to a rapid functional uncoupling of the PAFR from effector systems (16Morrison W.J. Dhar A. Shukla S.D.

However, the information available on the subsequent sequestration process is limited (23Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 793-800PubMed Google Scholar, 24Le Gouill C. Parent J.-L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21289-21295Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the fate of the sequestered PAFR has remained unknown. Furthermore, the potential role of receptor phosphorylation in the sequestration remains to be elucidated. We expressed epitope-tagged guinea pig PAFRs with cytoplasmic tail mutations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies directed against the epitopes enabled us to quantitate cell surface expression of the PAFR, to visualize PAFR movement, and to immunoprecipitate PAFR proteins for receptor phosphorylation assays. We gained novel information on PAFR dynamics during agonist-induced sequestration, recycling, and resensitization. The role of phosphorylation of the receptor cytoplasmic tail in each process was also evaluated using the mutant receptors.

PAF C16, 1-O-hexadecyl-2-(methylcarbamyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (mcPAF), anti-FLAG M5 monoclonal antibody, and anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody were obtained from Cascade Biochem (Reading, UK), Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), Kodak, and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. PAFR antagonists, WEB 2086 and TCV-309, were generous gifts from Boehringer Ingelheim and Takeda (Osaka, Japan), respectively. All other reagents, unless otherwise stated, were of analytical grade and were from Wako (Osaka) or Sigma. All mutations were introduced into a pBluescript SK(−) vector (Stratagene) containing the entire coding region of guinea pig PAFR cDNA (25Honda Z. Nakamura M. Miki I. Minami M. Watanabe T. Seyama Y. Okado H. Toh H. Ito K. Miyamoto T. Shimizu T. Nature. 1991; 349: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) using a Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH). For construction of epitope-tagged receptors, nucleotide sequences that encoded 8- or 9-amino acid peptides (DYKDDDDK for FLAG and YPYDVPDYA for HA) were inserted between the amino-terminal initiator methionine and the second amino acid of the wild-type (WT) or mutant PAFRs by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), as described elsewhere (20Ali H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The coding region of each construct was sequenced on both strands, using an ABI 373 DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer) and was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA I Neo (Invitrogen) for stable expression in CHO cells. CHO cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Ham's F12 medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical; Tokyo) supplemented with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The cells plated onto 12-well dishes were transfected with plasmid constructs using TRANSFECTAM (BioSepra, Marlborough, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells resistant to 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) were collected after 2 weeks of culture, cloned by limiting dilution, and screened for specific [3H]WEB 2086-binding activity (data not shown). The clones used in this study were selected based on PAFR expression level and were maintained in the presence of 0.3 mg/ml Geneticin. CHO cells were seeded onto 12-well dishes at 48 h prior to assay. The cells were washed twice with Tyrode's buffer (26Ishii I. Izumi T. Tsukamoto H. Umeyama H. Ui M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.1% of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA buffer) and were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h with graded concentrations of [3H]PAF in the presence (for nonspecific binding) or absence (for total binding) of 10 μm WEB 2086 in the same buffer. The cells were washed twice with the buffer and solubilized in 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The radioactivity associated with the cells was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The specific binding activity (total binding minus nonspecific binding) was determined for Scatchard plot analysis, and ligand-binding parameters, Kd (nm) and Bmax (fmol/well) were calculated. ABmax value of 100 fmol/well was roughly equal to 100,000 binding sites per single CHO cell (data not shown). CHO cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid were subjected to release assay, as described (26Ishii I. Izumi T. Tsukamoto H. Umeyama H. Ui M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Quantitation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) production after PAF stimulation was performed as described (26Ishii I. Izumi T. Tsukamoto H. Umeyama H. Ui M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), using an IP3 radioreceptor assay kit (NEN Life Science Products). Quantitation of cell surface expression of the PAFR was carried out as described by Gerard and Gerard (23Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 793-800PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. CHO cells were seeded onto CulturPlate 24 (Packard Instrument Co.) at 48 h prior to assay. The cells were washed twice with Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA buffer, subjected to various treatments at 37 °C for the indicated time, and then fixed with 2% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde in Ca2+,Mg2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Nissui) for 10 min. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h in Tyrode's buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 20% (v/v) FBS (Hepes/Tyrode's/FBS buffer) to reduce nonspecific binding, and for 30 min with or without 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG M5 or 5 μg/ml anti-HA 12CA5 antibody in the same buffer. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min with Hepes/Tyrode's/FBS buffer and for 30 min with 33.3 kBq of125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2fragment in the same buffer. The cells were then washed three times with PBS, dissolved in MicroScint 20 scintillator (Packard), and the radioactivity was counted in a TopCount Microplate Scintillation Counter (Packard). All procedures after fixing were carried out at room temperature. Antibody-dependent binding was used to show cell surface expression of the PAFR. Microscopy was done basically as described by Trapaidze et al. (27Trapaidze N. Keith D.E. Cvejic S. Evans C.J. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CHO cells were grown for 48 h on glass coverslips. After stimulation with agonists or antagonists, the cells were fixed with 2% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were washed twice with TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2), permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in Blotto buffer (3% nonfat dry milk in 50 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5)) for 15 min, washed twice with Blotto, and incubated for 1 h in Blotto. The cells were then incubated for 1 h with 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody in Blotto, washed three times with TBS, and incubated for 30 min with 5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies, Inc.) in Blotto. Then, they were washed three times with TBS and mounted with SlowFade antifade reagents (Molecular Probes). The cells were viewed under a Nikon Diaphot TMD300 fluorescence microscope with a NCF Fluor 100 × oil-immersion objective lens (Nikon) set at aperture number 1.3. Folic acid incorporation was measured as described (28Kamen B.A. Capdevila A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5983-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 29Kamen B.A. Wang M.T.

Cells were grown in 12-well dishes for 48 h in hand-prepared folic acid-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% FBS. Next, the cells were subjected to various treatments in folic acid-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to inhibit the clathrin- or caveolae-mediated pathways. Following these treatments, the cells were incubated with 50 nm[3H]folic acid in each medium for 90 min. After incubation, the cells were quickly washed with ice-cold Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA buffer, chilled on ice for 20 min, and washed twice with ice-cold acidic saline (150 mm NaCl adjusted to pH 3.0 with glacial acetic acid) to remove radioactive folic acid bound to the intrinsic cell surface folic acid receptors. The cells were then solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 and subjected to scintillation counting. CHO cells were subjected to hypertonic shock with 0.45 m sucrose, potassium depletion, and acidification with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm acetic acid (pH 5.0), as described in detail elsewhere (30Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), followed by analysis of PAFR sequestration and folic acid incorporation. CHO-FLAG-WT cells were seeded onto 6-well dishes at 48 h prior to assay. The cells were washed twice with methionine/cystine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) and incubated for 2 h in the same medium containing graded concentrations of cycloheximide. The cells were then incubated for 90 min in medium containing each concentration of cycloheximide and 3.7 MBq of [35S]EXPRESS Methionine/Cysteine Protein Labeling Mix. Next, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped into Eppendorf tubes with PBS, and precipitated in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 20 min on ice. The precipitates were washed twice with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, solubilized in 0.5n NaOH, and subjected to gamma counting. Agonist-induced phosphorylation of the PAFR was examined as described (21Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

On the day of assay, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in the same medium and for an additional 2 h in the medium containing 18.5 MBq [32P]orthophosphate. The cells were stimulated by ligands for the specified time, and the reaction was stopped by rapid washing with ice-cold PBS. All subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Adherent cells were scraped into Eppendorf tubes with a suspension buffer of the following composition: 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After washing twice with the suspension buffer, the cell pellets were solubilized in the solubilization buffer (the suspension buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, and 150 mm NaCl) by vigorous vortexing and rotational agitation for 1 h. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were precleared with 100 μl of Protein A/G Plus-Agarose (Santa Cruz). The supernatants were incubated with 10 μg of anti-HA 12CA5 antibody for 2 h, followed by incubation overnight with 100 μl of Protein A/G Plus-Agarose to precipitate the epitope-tagged receptors. The next day, the samples were washed 4 times with washing buffer (the suspension buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% ammonium sulfate) and then once with the same buffer lacking ammonium sulfate. SDS sample buffer was added to the pellets, and sonication was done in a water bath for 5 min. The solubilized proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film). PAFR sequestration was analyzed in transfected CHO cells expressing guinea pig receptors with amino-terminal and cytoplasmic tail mutations (Fig. 1). To detect the receptors immunochemically, an 8- or 9-amino acid epitope (FLAG or HA) was introduced into the extracellular amino-terminal domain of each receptor (Fig. 1, B–F). The wild-type receptor and mutant receptors, in which the cytoplasmic tail was truncated (HA-Del, His303 → termination codon) or substituted to lack Ser/Thr residues (HA-Tail-1, Ser318, Thr321, Thr322, Thr324, Thr326, Thr335 → Ala; HA-Tail-2, mutations in HA-Tail-1 plus Ser305, Ser313, Ser314 → Gly), were stably expressed in CHO cells. The mutations in HA-Tail-1 were restricted to the carboxyl-terminal domain following Cys317, a potential palmitoylation site (25Honda Z. Nakamura M. Miki I. Minami M. Watanabe T. Seyama Y. Okado H. Toh H. Ito K. Miyamoto T. Shimizu T. Nature. 1991; 349: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In all CHO transformants, saturation experiments with [3H]PAF revealed the existence of a single binding site class on Scatchard plot analysis (data not shown). There was no detectable specific PAF binding in untransfected or vector (pcDNA I Neo)-transfected CHO cells (data not shown). The ligand-binding parameters of each transformant, Kd (nm) and Bmax (fmol/well), were as follows: CHO-WT (a CHO transformant expressing the WT receptor shown in Fig. 1 A), Kd = 1.71 ± 0.24,Bmax = 319.4 ± 52.2; CHO-FLAG-WT,Kd = 2.17 ± 0.19, Bmax= 450.7 ± 28.7; CHO-HA-WT, Kd = 1.34 ± 0.24, Bmax = 216.9 ± 36.4; CHO-HA-Del,Kd = 1.06 ± 0.06, Bmax= 142.6 ± 12.6; CHO-HA-Tail-1, Kd = 2.27 ± 0.42, Bmax = 111.2 ± 16.1; CHO-HA-Tail-2, Kd = 1.50 ± 0.30,Bmax = 117.1 ± 14.6 (mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments done in duplicate). Thus, each transformant displayed PAF-binding parameters comparable to those of CHO-WT cells. PAF-induced arachidonic acid release in 6 min was comparable between these transformants (data not shown). In CHO-FLAG-WT cells, exposure to agonists (PAF or mcPAF) initiated receptor sequestration as assessed by anti-FLAG antibody binding to the cell surface receptors (Fig. 2). The sequestration occurred within 5 min after stimulation and reached a plateau after 1 h of incubation showing a half-life of 30 min (Fig. 2 A). PAF as well as mcPAF induced sequestration in a concentration-dependent manner, from a low concentration of 0.25 nm reaching a maximal effect at 10 nm with an EC50 value of 1–2 nm (Fig. 2 B). A second application of 100 nm PAF at 10, 30, or 60 min after the first application induced no further sequestration (Fig. 2 C). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed bright staining of the receptors all over the cell surface, including numerous punctuate patterns (Fig. 2 D, left). Following 60 min of incubation with 100 nm PAF, the fluorescence intensity of the cell surface was markedly reduced, and small areas of bright staining emerged in some intracellular compartments (Fig. 2 D, middle). To explore the mechanism of PAFR sequestration, CHO-FLAG-WT cells were subjected to pretreatments that inhibited the clathrin-mediated pathway such as hypertonic sucrose shock, potassium depletion, and acidification (30Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), followed by the sequestration assay (Table I). In parallel with these experiments, the pretreated cells were also assayed for folic acid incorporation, an event mediated by caveolae but not by clathrin (32Anderson R.G.W. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W. Science. 1992; 255: 410-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Folic acid incorporation was concentration-dependent up to 100 nm [3H]folic acid and was time-dependent within 4 h of incubation (data not shown), so incorporation was measured during 90 min of incubation with 50 nm [3H]folic acid.Table IPAF-induced sequestration of the PAF receptor but not folic acid incorporation was suppressed by treatments inhibiting the clathrin-mediated pathwayTreatmentPAF-induced sequestration of PAF receptorsFolic acid incorporation% control0.45 msucrose50.9 ± 6.2100.6 ± 3.7Potassium depletion2.5 ± 5.387.5 ± 0.6Acidification (pH 5.0)19.7 ± 15.4114.6 ± 8.8100 nm PMA96.7 ± 3.964.4 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab Hypertonic shock with 0.45 m sucrose prevented about half of PAF-induced PAFR sequestration but had no effect on folic acid incorporation. Potassium depletion caused almost complete inhibition (97.5%) of sequestration but slightly inhibited folic acid incorporation (only 12.5%). Acidification inhibited sequestration by 80.3% but had no obvious effect on folic acid incorporation. In addition, effect of 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on both activities was examined, because protein kinase C activators such as PMA reduced the number of caveolae and thus inhibited folic acid incorporation (33Smart E.J. Foster D.C. Ying Y.-S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 34Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Stimulation with PMA resulted in 35.6% loss of folic acid incorporation but caused no change in PAFR sequestration. No treatment caused marked interference with PAF binding to its receptor and PAF-induced signal transduction (data not shown). These data suggest that PAF-induced receptor sequestration is mostly through clathrin-coated pits. Agonist-induced phosphorylation of the PAFR at 10 min was compared among four kinds of CHO transformants (CHO-HA-WT, CHO-HA-Del, CHO-HA-Tail-1, and CHO-HA-Tail-2) (Fig. 3 A). Exposure of CHO-HA-WT cells to 100 nm PAF for 10 min resulted in phosphorylation of both 40–50- and 80–100-kDa proteins. Because we detected no corresponding bands in untransfected CHO cells or CHO-WT cells (data not shown), the immunoprecipitated radioactive proteins were presumed to be the HA-WT receptors. The 80–100-kDa bands may represent receptor dimers, as suggested by Ali et al. (20Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23563-24557PubMed Google Scholar). PAF induced phosphorylation of both bands in a concentration-dependent manner; it was detectable in 10 min at a concentration of 0.1 nm and reached a maximal level at 1 nm (data not shown). Phosphorylation was rapid and lasting; it was detectable 15 s after 100 nm PAF stimulation, reached a maximal level within 2.5 min, and lasted for at least 15 min (data not shown). In any case, both 40–50- and 80–100-kDa bands were phosphorylated proportionally (data not shown). PMA and dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2-cAMP), which activate protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively, have been shown to phosphorylate the human PAFR in RBL-2H3 cells (20Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23563-24557PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of CHO-HA-WT cells with 100 nm PMA or 1 mm Bt2-cAMP for 10 min also caused phosphorylation of the guinea pig receptor (Fig. 2 A). The maximal extent of the phosphorylation induced by PMA was about half that caused by PAF, whereas Bt2-cAMP was much less effective than PAF even though its effect was obvious by radioactive counting and reproducible. PAF, PMA, and Bt2-cAMP induced much less phosphorylation in the three cytoplasmic tail mutant receptors as in the HA-WT receptor. Thus, most of the phosphorylation targets in the PAF receptor for these different stimuli exist in the cytoplasmic tail Ser/Thr residues (especially the carboxyl-terminal six Ser/Thr residues). These four transformants were also examined for receptor sequestration. PAF induced sequestration of HA-Del and HA-Tail-2 receptors, although the extent of sequestration was much less than that of the HA-WT receptor (Fig. 2 B). The HA-Tail-1 recept"
https://openalex.org/W2075956852,The Gal6 protease is in a class of cysteine peptidases identified by their ability to inactivate the anti-cancer drug bleomycin. The protein forms a barrel structure with the active sites embedded in a channel as in the proteasome. In Gal6 the C termini lie in the active site clefts. We show that Gal6 acts as a carboxypeptidase on its C terminus to convert itself to an aminopeptidase and peptide ligase. The substrate specificity of the peptidase activity is determined by the position of the C terminus of Gal6 rather than the sequence of the substrate. We propose a model to explain these diverse activities and Gal6's singular ability to inactivate bleomycin.

Since protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases), which have pivotal roles in many cellular functions, have a critical cysteine in their active site, we have proposed PTPases as likely targets for Cpd 5. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of Cpd 5 on protein tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and on the activity of PTPases. We found that Cpd 5 rapidly induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Hep3B) at growth inhibitory doses, and the effect was blocked by thiols but not by non-thiol antioxidants or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Cpd 5 inhibited PTPase activity, which was also significantly antagonized by reduced glutathione. Furthermore, the well studied PTPase inhibitor orthovanadate also induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation and growth inhibition in Hep3B cells. These results suggest that inhibition of cellular PTPases by sulfhydryl arylation and subsequent perturbation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation may be involved in the mechanisms of Cpd 5-induced cell growth inhibition.

The vitamin K family of molecules contains both natural and synthetic forms, the former including vitamin K1(phylloquinone) and vitamin K2 (menaquinones) and the latter including vitamin K3 (menadione). The physiological function of natural K vitamins is to act as a cofactor of γ-glutamylcarboxylase, which catalyzes the carboxylation of glutamate residues into γ-carboxyglutamate in prothrombin and the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors VII, IX, and X; proteins C and S; as well as several other proteins (1Suttie J.W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). K vitamins, sharing a naphthoquinone nucleus, also inhibit cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, with vitamin K3 being more potent than vitamin K1 and K2 (2Prasad K.N. Edwards-Prasad J. Sakamoto A.

This mixed nature of vitamin K action has also been suggested by our previous data showing that vitamin K3-induced growth inhibition in Hep3B cells, derived from human hepatocellular carcinoma, is prevented by both exogenous thiols and non-thiol antioxidants (catalase and deferoxamine mesylate) (14Wang Z. Wang M. Finn F. Carr B.I. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 876-882PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nishikawa Y. Carr B.I. Wang M. Kar S. Finn F. Dowd P. Zheng Z.B. Kerns J. Naganathan S. J. Biol.

We recently synthesized several vitamin K analogs and found that 2-(2-mercaptoethanol)-3-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone or compound 5 (Cpd 5) 1The abbreviations used are: Cpd 5, compound 5 or 2-(2-mercaptoethanol)-3-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone; PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor. is a more potent growth inhibitor and apoptosis inducer than K vitamins for Hep3B cells (15Nishikawa Y.

From its chemical structure, Cpd 5 is predicted to exert its action through arylation of cellular thiols or thiol-dependent proteins by an addition-elimination mechanism (16Kerns J. Naganathan S. Dowd P. Finn F. Carr B.I. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In fact, the Cpd 5-mediated cell growth inhibition has been shown to be antagonized only by thiols but not by non-thiol antioxidants in Hep3B cells, suggesting that the major mechanism of growth inhibition is sulfhydryl arylation rather than oxidative stress (15Nishikawa Y. Carr B.I. Wang M. Kar S. Finn F. Dowd P. Zheng Z.B. Kerns J. Naganathan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28304-28310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It is not clear which cellular proteins are inactivated by the sulfhydryl arylation. In a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2), vitamin K3 was found to induce a hyperphosphorylated state of p34cdc2 kinase and decrease the activity of cell lysates to hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl phosphate, indicating alteration of protein tyrosine phosphorylation (17Juan C.-C. Wu F.-Y.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since the active site of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) contains a cysteine residue, which is known to play an essential role in the catalytic process of tyrosine dephosphorylation (18Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31323-31326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), we have proposed that Cpd 5 may arylate the critical cysteine and inactivate PTPases, causing perturbed status of protein tyrosine phosphorylation (16Kerns J. Naganathan S. Dowd P. Finn F. Carr B.I. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes are involved in the regulation of cell growth and many other cellular functions (20Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2600) Google Scholar,21Hunter T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 307-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether there was a relationship between growth inhibition and induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in Hep3B cells by Cpd 5. We also compared the effects of Cpd 5 with those of orthovanadate, a well studied PTPase inhibitor. Our results suggest that PTPase inhibition and subsequent perturbation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation may have important role in Cpd 5-mediated growth inhibition. Cpd 5 was synthesized as described previously (16Kerns J. Naganathan S. Dowd P. Finn F. Carr B.I. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Hep3B cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were maintained in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For the growth inhibition assay, the cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates (Corning, Inc., Science Products Div., Corning, NY). Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was replaced with a medium containing Cpd 5 or orthovanadate at various concentrations. After treatment, plates were emptied and stored at −80 °C. Cell number was counted daily by a DNA fluorometric assay (22Rago R. Mitchen J. Wilding G. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). On the day of assay, 250 μl of distilled water were added to each well, and plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After the incubation, the plates were frozen at −80 °C and then thawed at room temperature. The fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 (20 μg/ml) in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 m NaCl) was added to each well (250 μl/well), and fluorescence was measured (excitation at 360 nm, emission at 460 nm). Another assay was employed to examine the effects of various antioxidants on growth inhibition by Cpd 5. Hep3B cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 6-well plates (Corning, Inc.). After overnight incubation, the cells were treated with Cpd 5 (20 μm) with or without thiols and non-thiol oxidants and further cultured for 48 h. Then the medium was replaced with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and incubated for 3 h in a CO2 incubator. Converted dye was then dissolved in acid isopropanol (0.08 n HCl in isopropanol), and absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm with background subtraction at 660 nm. Hep3B cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/dish in 6-well plates with Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were exposed to various agents at different concentrations. After the exposure, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ng/ml leupeptin, 10 ng/ml aprotinin). Insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. Aliquots of samples were used for measurement of protein concentration using the Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad). Treated cell lysates (40 μg of protein/lane) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using 10% polyacrylamide gels. Then proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (NEN Life Science Products). After blocking the membrane with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, the membrane was incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Ab-2, Oncogene Research Products, Calbiochem, Cambridge, MA), and then washed with the Tris buffer and incubated with anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Detection was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (NEN Life Science Products). PTPase activities were measured using a PTPase assay kit from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Myelin basic protein, a substrate for PTPase, was phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues with Abl protein-tyrosine kinase in the presence of [γ-33P]ATP and then dialyzed overnight to remove residual ATP. For cell lysate PTPase assay, 5 × 105Hep3B cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 0.25 ml of 25 mm imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1% Triton X-100, and further subjected to brief sonication. Then the cell lysates were diluted by addition of 2 ml of 25 mm imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes for PTPase assay. The assay was done in 25-μl reactions. Prior to adding the substrate, purified T cell PTPase (5 ng/reaction) or cell lysates (3 μg/reaction) were preincubated with Cpd 5, with or without GSH at 30 °C for 30 min. They were then incubated with γ-33P-labeled myelin basic protein (approximately 1.5 μg/reaction) at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 200 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were then centrifuged, and the radioactivity in the supernatants was counted by a scintillation counter. The effect of Cpd 5 on Hep3B cell growth was first examined. It showed potent growth inhibition at micromolar concentrations (Fig. 1). The phosphotyrosine immunoblotting technique was then applied, to examine whether Cpd 5 affected tyrosine phosphorylation status of cellular proteins in Hep3B cells. Subconfluent Hep3B cells were treated with Cpd 5 for various times. There was a dramatic increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation within a few minutes (Fig. 2 A). The peak of the induction varied slightly in different experiments, in the range of 1 to 10 min. Cpd 5 appeared to be a specific inducer of tyrosine phosphorylation, since no significant induction was found for serine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B) or threonine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 C). Anti-actin antibody was used as a control for protein loading (Fig. 2 A, bottom). The induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation was dose-dependent (Fig. 3), and broadly paralleled the doses that were found to be growth inhibitory (Fig. 1).Figure 2Effects of Cpd 5 on protein tyrosine, serine, and threonine phosphorylation in Hep3B cells. Cells were exposed to 20 μm Cpd 5 for the indicated times. The cells were then lysed and cellular proteins (40 μg/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The fractionated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were demonstrated by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (A). The same membrane was repeatedly stripped and incubated with anti-actin antibody (loading control), with anti-phosphoserine antibody (B), and with anti-phosphothreonine antibody (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Effects of Cpd 5 on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in Hep3B cells (dose response). Cells were plated in 6-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 24 h. Then, the cells were exposed to Cpd 5 at various concentrations for 3 min. The cells were then lysed and subjected to phosphotyrosine immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effects of various thiols and non-thiol antioxidants on Cpd 5-induced growth inhibition and protein tyrosine phosphorylation were then examined. When Hep3B cells were treated with Cpd 5 (20 μm) in the presence of 2 mm of l-cysteine (Cys), GSH, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine, the growth inhibitory effect by Cpd 5 was completely abrogated (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, non-thiol antioxidants, such as catalase, deferoxamine mesylate, butylated hydroxyanisole, and superoxide dismutase, had no antagonistic effects on the growth inhibition (Fig. 4 A). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation was examined after pretreatment with above antioxidants for 5 min, followed by addition of Cpd 5 (20 μm). The induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation by Cpd 5 was also completely abrogated by exogenous thiols, but not by any of non-thiol antioxidants (Fig. 4 B), suggesting sulfhydryl arylation is related to both growth inhibition and increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation in Hep3B cells. Since protein tyrosine phosphorylation is considered to be regulated by the balance of PTPases and protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), either activation of PTKs or inhibition of PTPases could result in net increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. To test whether the activation of PTK is involved in Cpd 5-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, Hep3B cells were treated with genistein or a tyrphostin, potent inhibitors of PTKs (23Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Gazit A. Yaish P. Gilon C. Levitzki A. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), prior to addition of Cpd 5. Since epidermal growth factor (EGF) is known to activate PTKs, including EGF receptor kinase, EGF was added to parallel cultures. As shown in Fig. 5, the induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation by Cpd 5 was affected neither by genistein nor tyrphostin 23, while EGF-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation was completely blocked by these PTK inhibitors. The results suggest that the induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation by Cpd 5 is not likely due to PTK activation. We previously proposed that PTPases containing a critical cysteine residue in their active site might be the targets of Cpd 5 (16Kerns J. Naganathan S. Dowd P. Finn F. Carr B.I. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore the ability of Cpd 5 to inactivate purified PTPase (T cell PTPase) was examined. It almost completely inhibited the PTPase activity at 40 μm (Fig. 6 A). The presence of GSH in the reaction significantly antagonized the PTPase inhibition by Cpd 5 (Fig. 5 A). The effects of Cpd 5 on PTPase activity in Hep3B cell lysates were subsequently tested. PTPase activity in cell lysates was also inhibited, but the inhibition was partial (approximately 40% by 40 μm Cpd 5), suggesting that some PTPases in cell lysates may be resistant to the action of exogenously added Cpd 5, or the presence of protective substances in cell lysates (Fig. 6 B). Preincubation of the cell lysates with GSH also effectively antagonized the Cpd 5-induced PTPase inhibition (Fig. 6 B). The results described above suggested that inhibition of PTPase and increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation may play a role in Cpd 5-induced cell growth inhibition. Thus, the effects of orthovanadate, a well studied PTPase inhibitor (25Swarup G. Speeg Jr., K.V. Cohen S. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7298-7301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Leis J.F. Kaplan N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6507-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), on cell growth and protein tyrosine phosphorylation were investigated in Hep3B cells. First, Hep3B cells were cultured with orthovanadate at various concentrations as in the experiment shown in Fig. 1. Orthovanadate was also found to be a potent growth inhibitor (Fig. 7). It showed a significant effect on cell growth at 2.5 μm and completely inhibited cell growth at 5 μm. Orthovanadate also induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 8), consistent with its known effect as a PTPase inhibitor.Figure 8Effects of orthovanadate on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in Hep3B cells. Cells were treated with orthovanadate at various concentrations for 10 min. Then the cells were lysed and subjected to phosphotyrosine immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the present study, we investigated possible mechanisms for the growth inhibition by Cpd 5, a thioether vitamin K analog, which was generated by addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to vitamin K3(16Kerns J. Naganathan S. Dowd P. Finn F. Carr B.I. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although vitamin K3 is known to inhibit growth of many cell types (2Prasad K.N.

Hepatology. 1995; 22: 876-882PubMed Google Scholar), the growth inhibitory activity of Cpd 5 has been found to surpass that of vitamin K3 (15Nishikawa Y. Carr B.I. Wang M. Kar S. Finn F. Dowd P. Zheng Z.B. Kerns J. Naganathan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28304-28310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We previously suggested that Cpd 5 and other thioether analogs efficiently arylate cellular thiols by an addition-elimination mechanism (16Kerns J. Naganathan S. Dowd P. Finn F. Carr B.I. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and provided evidence that the sulfhydryl arylation mediates growth inhibitory effects (15Nishikawa Y. Carr B.I. Wang M. Kar S. Finn F. Dowd P. Zheng Z.B. Kerns J. Naganathan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28304-28310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We also proposed that PTPases, which contain a critical cysteine in their active site (18Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31323-31326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), might be likely targets for the sulfhydryl arylation (16Kerns J. Naganathan S. Dowd P. Finn F. Carr B.I. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here, we found that Cpd 5 induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in Hep3B cells and indeed inhibited PTPase activity. Furthermore, we found that exogenous thiols completely blocked these effects of Cpd 5. The results support our hypothesis. The regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in cellular proteins is implicated in many biological processes, including cell growth, cell differentiation, and cell cycle control (20Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2600) Google Scholar, 21Hunter T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 307-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that Cpd 5-induced rapid and potent tyrosine phosphorylation of many proteins in Hep3B cells may be responsible for its potent growth inhibitory effect. The close relationship between these two processes is supported by the fact that exogenous thiols that abrogated growth inhibition by Cpd 5 also inhibited the induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation by Cpd 5. Although the ligand binding-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of substrate proteins is thought to activate signal transduction by growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity, such as EGF, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors (27Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar), the functional outcomes of tyrosine phosphorylation may vary among proteins (28Glenney Jr J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1134: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Sun H. Tonks N.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 480-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that duration (30Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4235) Google Scholar) and extent (31Yousefi S. Green D.R. Blaser K. Simon H.-U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is also a determinant of consequences of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Interestingly, increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation has also been reported to be associated with growth inhibition and apoptosis (31Yousefi S. Green D.R. Blaser K. Simon H.-U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 32Schick M.R. Nguyen V.Q. Levy S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1818-1925Google Scholar, 33Eischen C.M. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J.

Reddy K.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 173-178PubMed Google Scholar). Given that phosphorylation status of tyrosine residues in cellular proteins is jointly governed by PTPases and PTKs (20Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2600) Google Scholar, 29Sun H. Tonks N.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 480-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), either activation of PTK or inhibition of PTPases could cause increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation. If PTK activation is the main cause, the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation should be inhibited by PTK inhibitors, such as genistein and tyrphostins (23Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Gazit A. Yaish P. Gilon C. Levitzki A. J. Med.

Zilberstein A. Gazit A. Gilon C. Levitzki A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14503-14509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, in our study, EGF-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in Hep3B cells was completely prevented by the pretreatment with genistein or tyrphostin 23. A similar approach has been used to elucidate the role of PTK activation in the increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by other reagents (32Schick M.R. Nguyen V.Q. Levy S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1818-1925Google Scholar, 33Eischen C.M. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1947-1953PubMed Google Scholar, 37Chao W. Liu H. Hanahan D.J. Olson M.S. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, our results showed that Cpd 5-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation was not affected either by genistein or tyrphostin 23, suggesting that PTK activation is not the main mechanism. We demonstrated that Cpd 5 inhibited PTPase activity at micromolar concentrations. It completely inhibited the activity of T cell PTPase, a widely expressed intracellular PTPase originally cloned from a human peripheral T cell cDNA library (38Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Walsh K.A. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5257-5261Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In contrast to T cell PTPase, PTPase activity in crude Hep3B cell lysates was only partially inhibited by Cpd 5 even at high concentrations. Similar results were obtained with orthovanadate. Although the reasons for the partial inhibition are not clear, it suggests that the cell lysates may contain inhibitors of the Cpd 5-PTPase interactions, that some PTPases are more resistant than others to inhibition by Cpd 5, or that some cellular PTPases are not accessible to the action of Cpd 5, possibly due to cellular compartmentation. The latter two possibilities might be more likely, since orthovanadate has been reported to inhibit cytosolic PTPase activity 10 times more effectively than particulate fraction PTPase activity purified from a rat hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (39Meyerovitch J. Backer J.M. Csermely P. Shoelson S.E. Kahn C.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10338-10344Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Importantly, we also found significant antagonistic effects of GSH on the PTPase inhibition by Cpd 5, implying that sulfhydryl reactions were involved in the inhibition of enzyme activity. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that inhibition of PTPases by Cpd 5 and subsequent perturbation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation are involved in its potent growth inhibition. PTPases are tightly regulated in many cellular functions, including growth factor and cytokine signaling pathways (40Brautigan D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 63-77PubMed Google Scholar, 41Yakura H. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 13: 311-336Crossref Google Scholar, 42Motozaki T. Kasuga M. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphatase superfamily represents a large family of enzymes, including tyrosine-specific phosphatases, VH1 (vaccinia virus late H1 gene)-like dual specificity, Cdc25, and low molecular weight phosphatases (19Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). While tyrosine- specific phosphatases, intracellular (PTP1B, PTP1D, TC-PTPase, and so forth) and receptor-like (PTPμ, PTPβ, CD45, and so forth), and low molecular weight phosphatases react with phosphotyrosine alone, VH1-like dual specificity phosphatases (VH1, VHR, PAC-1, MKP1, and so forth) and Cdc25 (Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C) hydrolyze both phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine (phosphoserine) residues (18Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31323-31326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 20Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2600) Google Scholar). All of these phosphatases share a motif consisting of a cysteine and an arginine, separated by five residues in their active site (18Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31323-31326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The cysteine functions as an essential nucleophile to accept the PO3 moiety and the mutation of this residue results in an almost total loss of the enzyme activity (43Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Tsai A.Y.M. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8698-8702Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 44Pot D.A. Woodford T.A. Remboutsika E. Haun R.S. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19688-19696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since quinone sulfides, such as Cpd 5, can effectively arylate thiols by an addition-elimination mechanism, Cpd 5 may form a covalent bond with the critical cysteine in the active site of PTPases, thereby inhibiting their activity (16Kerns J. Naganathan S. Dowd P. Finn F. Carr B.I. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Vitamin K3 can also arylate cellular thiols by a simple addition mechanism (7Ross D. Thor H. Orrenius S. Moldéus P. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1985; 55: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Wilson I. Wardman P. Lin T.-S. Sartonelli A.C. Chem.-Biol.

In fact, vitamin K3 has been shown to inhibit the activity of Cdc25 (45Borgne A. Meijer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27847-27854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,46Ham S.W. Park H.J. Lim D.H. Bioorg. Chem. 1997; 25: 33-36Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar), consistent with the vitamin K3-induced hyperphosphorylated state of p34cdc2 that is dephosphorylated by Cdc25 (17Juan C.-C. Wu F.-Y.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Vitamin K3 also inhibits T cell PTPase activity, but the effect is less potent than Cpd 5. 2Y. Nishikawa and B. I. Carr, unpublished observations. Interestingly, a benzoquinoid compound with likely arylation capacity (dephostatin) has been reported to be a potent PTPase inhibitor (47Imoto M. Kakeya H. Sawa T. Hayashi C. Hamada M. Takeuchi T. Umezawa K. Antibiotics. 1993; 46: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, halomethyl derivatives of vitamin K3, being more sulfhydryl-reactive than original vitamin K3, have been reported to inhibit thiol-containing NADPH-cytochrome creductase (48Talcot R.E. Ketterman A. Giannini D.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 2663-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Sulfhydryl arylation has also been proposed for the mechanism of inhibition of pp60v-src PTK by quinone-containing herbimycin A (49Uehara Y. Fukazawa H. Murakami Y Mizuno S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and a polyketide (50Lee R.H. Slate D.L. Moretti R. Alvi K.A. Crews P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It will be intriguing to know whether Cpd 5 may have inhibitory effects on these enzymes. Orthovanadate is a general PTPase inhibitor (25Swarup G. Speeg Jr., K.V. Cohen S. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7298-7301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Leis J.F. Kaplan N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6507-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), although it has been reported to exert other diverse effects, including Na+,K+-ATPase inhibition and direct stimulation of PTKs (51Nechay B.R. Manninga L.B. Nechay P.S. Post R.L. Grantham J.J. Macara I.G. Kubena L.F. Phillips T.D. Nielsen F.H. Fed. Proc. 1996; 45: 123-132Google Scholar, 52Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). As a phosphate analog, orthovanadate behaves as a reversible, competitive inhibitor of PTPases (53Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of PTPases complexed with orthovanadate have revealed that vanadate ion forms a covalent linkage with the cysteine in the active site (54Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 55Zhang M. Zhou M. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that orthovanadate had similar, but slightly more potent cell growth inhibitory effects than Cpd 5, as well as induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and PTPase inhibition. Phenylarsine oxide, a PTPase inhibitor, has also been reported to induce cell death (apoptosis) and protein tyrosine phosphorylation in a murine T cell hybridoma (56Garcia-Morales P. Minami Y. Luong E. Klausner R.D. Samelson L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9255-9259Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and in human leukocytes (31Yousefi S. Green D.R. Blaser K. Simon H.-U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Recently, another PTPase inhibitor, RK-682, has been demonstrated to inhibit cell growth and to induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation in a human B cell leukemia cell line (34Hamaguchi T. Sudo T. Osada H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These data support the close relationship between PTPase inhibition, induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and cell growth inhibition or apoptosis. Commonly used cancer cell growth inhibitory drugs, such as doxorubicin,cis-platinum, and vinblastine, do not have PTPase inhibitory activity (57Baratte B. Meijer L. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 873-880PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Cpd 5, as a unique PTPase inhibitor and a potent cell growth inhibitor, may represent a novel class of cancer cell growth inhibitors. Our preliminary experiments have demonstrated that subcutaneous injection of Cpd 5 in rats almost completely inhibits liver DNA synthesis after a partial hepatectomy without causing significant systemic toxicity (58Carr B.I.

Furthermore, vanadate has been shown to reverse multidrug resistance in leukemia cells (61Coliu M. Madoulet C. Baccard N. Arsac F. Jardillier J.C.

In summary, the present study demonstrated that the growth inhibitory effect of Cpd 5 is closely associated with induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which may be due to the inhibition of PTPases by Cpd 5 through arylating the cysteine in the active site of the enzymes. Studies designed to elucidate the signaling pathways relevant to growth inhibition are under way in our laboratory. We thank Drs. Siddharta Kar and Ziqiu Wang for critically reading the manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2047632653,"The RNase H activity of reverse transcriptase (RT) is presumably required to cleave the RNA genome following minus strand synthesis to free the DNA for use as a template during plus strand synthesis. However, since RNA degradation by RNase H appears to generate RNA fragments too large to spontaneously dissociate from the minus strand, we have investigated the possibility that RNA displacement by RT during plus strand synthesis contributes to the removal of RNA fragments. By using an RNase H−mutant of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) RT, we demonstrate that the polymerase can displace long regions of RNA in hybrid duplex with DNA but that this activity is approximately 5-fold slower than DNA displacement and 20-fold slower than non-displacement synthesis. Furthermore, we find that although certain hybrid sequences seem nearly refractory to the initiation of RNA displacement, the same sequences may not significantly impede synthesis when preceded by a single-stranded gap. We find that the rate of RNA displacement synthesis by wild-type M-MuLV RT is significantly greater than that of the RNase H− RT but remains less than the rate of non-displacement synthesis. M-MuLV nucleocapsid protein increases the rates of RNA and DNA displacement synthesis approximately 2-fold, and this activity appears to require the zinc finger domain.

Retroviral replication requires the single-stranded RNA genome of the virus to be converted into double-stranded DNA through a complex series of reactions termed reverse transcription. This process appears to be catalyzed solely by the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; SSB, single-strand binding protein; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; M-MuLV, Moloney murine leukemia virus; NC, nucleocapsid; LTR, long terminal repeat; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); DTT, dithiothreitol; SSII, RNase H− M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II); oligo, oligonucleotide(s). that possesses the following two distinct enzymatic activities: a polymerase activity that synthesizes DNA using either RNA or DNA templates, and an RNase H activity that cleaves RNA in hybrid duplex with DNA (1Varmus H.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The current model of reverse transcription proposes that the RNase H activity of RT is critical for several steps including degradation of the 5′ end of the RNA genome following minus-strong-stop DNA synthesis to facilitate the first jump, specific cleavage at the polypurine tract to create the plus strand primer, and removal of the plus and minus strand primers (3Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 103-118Google Scholar). Additionally, it is presumed that the RNase H activity is required to degrade the RNA genome following minus strand synthesis to free the minus strand DNA for use as a template during plus strand synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 3Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 103-118Google Scholar). In vitrostudies, however, suggest that RNA fragments that are too large to spontaneously dissociate from the minus strand remain following cleavage of the genome (4DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M.

Furthermore, evidence that plus strand synthesis in several retroviral systems is discontinuous demonstrates that stably annealed RNA fragments persist in vivo (3Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 103-118Google Scholar,12Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J.

Virol. 1991; 65: 2415-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the interesting possibility that reverse transcription requires a mechanism for the displacement of genomic RNA fragments during plus strand synthesis. Most replicative polymerases require accessory proteins such as helicases and single-strand binding proteins (SSBs) to unpair the duplex region in front of the primer terminus during DNA synthesis (15Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). In contrast, studies from our laboratory 2Whiting, S. H., and Champoux, J. J. (1998)J. Mol. Biol., in press. and others (16Fuentes G.M. Rodrı́guez-Rodrı́guez L. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Virol. 1994; 68: 4747-4758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that RTs from several retroviral systems possess the capacity to catalyze displacement of the non-template DNA strand in the absence of accessory proteins, although the rate of synthesis appears to be roughly 3–12-fold slower than that found during non-displacement synthesis on a single-stranded template. Similarly, both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) RTs appear to possess at least a limited capacity to displace non-template RNA during synthesis on RNA-DNA hybrid templates (21Fuentes G.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1719-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but this process has not been characterized in detail. Since reverse transcription to yield full-length viral DNA in vitro has only been achieved in permeabilized virions or ribonucleoprotein complexes (22Boone L.R. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 117-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chen M. Garon C.F. Papas T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Gilboa E. Mitra S.W. Goff S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1979; 18: 93-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), it seems possible that one or more virion-associated accessory proteins are required for the complete reaction. A leading candidate for the role of an accessory factor is the viral nucleocapsid (NC) protein. NC is a small, basic protein that possesses either one or two zinc finger motifs in conventional retroviruses. NC binds nucleic acids with some apparent cooperativity, shows a higher binding affinity for RNA over DNA with a preference for single strands, and promotes renaturation between complementary nucleic acid chains (25Surovoy A.

Many studies have indicated that NC promotes the first and second template switches and is important during the initiation of reverse transcription from the tRNA primer (35Allain B.

In this study we have tested the ability of M-MuLV RT to catalyze RNA displacement synthesis in the absence or presence of the RNase H activity, and we have investigated the effects of NC on both DNA and RNA displacement synthesis. Our results indicate that RT has the capacity to displace RNA, but the rate is slower than that of DNA displacement synthesis and much slower than non-displacement synthesis. We find that M-MuLV NC facilitates displacement and that this activity is dependent on the zinc finger motif of the protein. SuperScript II (200U/μl) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. T4 DNA polymerase (3 units/μl), T4 polynucleotide kinase, Vent DNA polymerase, and restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs. Recombinant M-MuLV RT (200 units/μl) and Sequenase (13 units/μl) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Denaturing polyacrylamide gels (8.3 m urea) were prepared from Sequagel reagents (National Diagnostics). The recombinant phagemid pBSMOLTR(−) was generated as described previously for pBSMOLTR(+)2 except the long terminal repeat (LTR) insert was cloned into pBluescript II KS(−) (Stratagene) such that minus sense single-stranded DNA would be isolated by infection with M13KO7 helper phage. The recombinant phagemid pGEMLTR2 contains a 645-bp fragment of the M-MuLV LTR isolated from pBSMOLTR(−) (genome position 7851 to 231) and cloned into pGEM3Zf(+) (Promega Corp.). Single-stranded pGEMLTR2 DNA produced by helper phage rescue contained minus strand viral sequences. Phagemid pGEMLTR3 was generated by cloning a 744-bpEcoRI-BamHI LTR insert from pBSMOLTR(−) into pGEM3Zf(−) such that phage-rescued single-stranded DNA contained plus strand viral sequences. For brevity, nucleic acids derived from pGEMLTR2 and pGEMLTR3 will be referred to as LTR2 and LTR3, respectively. M13LTR2 was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and cloning of a 697-bp region of pGEMLTR2 (including the insert) into M13mp7 at the HincII restriction enzyme sites. Various single-stranded recombinant phagemid and phage DNAs were isolated by established procedures (46Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Where indicated, the single-stranded phagemid DNA was linearized by restriction enzyme digestion after annealing an oligonucleotide that generated the restriction enzyme recognition site, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction of the product. To recover the single-stranded insert (ssLTR2i) from M13LTR2, the DNA was heated to 90 °C, slow-cooled in EcoRI buffer to anneal the complementary regions flanking the insert, and digested with 500 units of EcoRI in a final volume of 0.5 ml for 1 h at 37 °C. Following phenol/chloroform extraction, the 687-nt single-stranded EcoRI product was gel-isolated with QIAEX II (QIAGEN) on a 0.7% agarose gel following the manufacturer's protocol. Several gel-isolated DNA fragment preparations were combined and further purified over an anion column (QIAGEN-tip 100) as specified by the manufacturer. For LTR2 RNA,BamHI-linearized LTR2 DNA was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase as specified in the RiboMAX kit (Promega) except that prior to DNase I treatment, the reaction was treated with Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (∼0.4 units/μg plasmid DNA) for 20 min at 37 °C to remove 5′-triphosphates (46Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Full-length RNA transcripts were purified by electrophoresis on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and elution into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA (TE) for 14 h at 25 °C. The eluate was filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter (Corning Glass Works), ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate, and resuspended in TE. LTR3 RNA was generated using SP6 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) following established procedures (46Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Following phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the RNA was treated for 20 min at 37 °C with E. colialkaline phosphatase (2 units/μg RNA). SDS was added to 0.05%, and the RNA was extracted twice each with phenol and chloroform, ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate, and resuspended in TE. To establish the efficiency of full-length RNA production, parallel transcription reactions were carried out containing 36 μm UTP and 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. Although a detectable fraction of the LTR3 RNA appeared to be truncated (perhaps due to premature termination by SP6 RNA polymerase), >80% of the transcripts were 500 nt or larger. Therefore, all calculations involving RNA displacement on pGEMLTR3 used 500 bases as the effective end of the displacement region. All RNAs were stored at −80 °C. Synthesis and purification of RNA oligo IV have been described previously (47Randolph C.A. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19207-19215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotides R+ and R−, corresponding to the R region of the M-MuLV genome (48Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Pernelle C. Borie C. Darlix J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2434-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by J. L. Darlix (LaboRetro, INSERM, Lyon, France). DNA oligo IV was synthesized on a Biosearch 8600 DNA synthesizer, and the remaining DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Macromolecular Resources. All DNA oligonucleotides except R+, R−, Bamsite, Ecosite, T7M13, and TermM13 were further purified by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DNA oligo II (5′-AGAAAAAGGGGGGAAT-3′) and DNA and RNA oligos IV (5′-GAAAGACCCCACC-3′) correspond to sequence positions 7801–7816 and 7817–7829 of the M-MuLV genome, respectively (49Shinnick T.M. Lerner R.A. Sutcliffe J.G. Nature. 1981; 293: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). T7 primer (5′-GTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATA-3′), T730 primer (5′-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATA-3′), and SP6 primer (5′-GCCAAGCTATTTAGGTGACACTATA-3′) anneal to the T7 and SP6 promoter regions on single-stranded DNA from plasmids pGEMLTR2 (T7 and T730) (see Fig. 2) or pGEMLTR3 (SP6), immediately upstream of the RNA transcription start site. DD oligos, LTR2Nhe (5′-GGGCGCTTAAGTA-3′) and LTR3hind (5′-GAATACTCAAGCTTGCAT-3′) anneal immediately downstream of the T7 and SP6 primers, respectively. Gap-primer (5′-CCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTT-3′) anneals to single-stranded LTR2 40 nucleotides upstream of the RNA transcription start site (see Fig. 4 A). Bamsite (5′-TCTGTGGGATCCTCTAGA-3′) and Ecosite (5′-ACTCTAGAATTCGCCCTACCACC-3′) create BamHI orEcoRI restriction sites when annealed to single-stranded LTR2 or LTR3, respectively. T7M13 (5′-CGGAATTCGGGCCAGTGAATTG-3′) and TermM13 (5′-CGGAATTCCCACAGATAAGTTGC-3′) were used to polymerase chain reaction-amplify the LTR insert from pGEMLTR2 with the introduction of flanking EcoRI sites. When necessary, oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-end-labeled as described previously.2The 100-bp DNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) was 5′-32P-end-labeled by the polynucleotide kinase exchange reaction (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.66Google Scholar).Figure 4Comparison of RNA displacement synthesis on gapped versus nicked primer-templates. A, shown schematically are the primer-templates used to compare synthesis on the gapped and nicked templates using linearized single-stranded LTR2 DNA as the template strand. The nicked template is identical to the LTR2 RNA displacement template (see Fig. 2 A). The gap-primer anneals to the single-stranded DNA template 40 bases upstream from the 5′ end of the RNA, leaving a 40-base single-stranded “gap” between the end-labeled primer and the non-template RNA strand. B, synthesis on non-displacement (lanes 1–3), gapped (lanes 4–8), and nicked (lanes 13–17) templates by SSII was terminated at the time points (in minutes) indicatedabove each lane, and the products were analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The positions of the first base of RNA displacement are indicated by the arrows and, for the gapped template, were determined by reading the adjacent sequencing ladder (lanes 9–12) generated using 5′-32P-labeled gap-primer. The vertical line (at left) marks the position of a series of pauses on single-stranded DNA unique to the gapped template.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To ensure that only the downstream oligonucleotides varied between reactions, the oligonucleotides were annealed to the single-stranded template DNA in two stages. In the first stage, the end-labeled primer (oligo II) was annealed to the single-stranded DNA template (pBSMOLTR) at a molar ratio of 1:1.5 in 1.4× RT buffer (see below), by heating to 63 °C, and then slow-cooling to 14 °C. In the second stage, the annealed sample was divided into three parts to which were added either DNA oligo IV (DNA displacement), RNA oligo IV (RNA displacement), or TE (non-displacement) resulting in a ratio of primer:template:downstream oligonucleotide of 1:1.5:7.5 (see also Fig. 1 A). The second stage annealing was performed under the same conditions as the first. The DNA displacement templates were prepared as follows (see also Fig. 2 A): the DD oligo (corresponding to the 5′ end of the downstream non-template strand) was annealed to linear single-stranded DNA (or ssLTR2i for NC assays) at a 1:2 molar ratio (single-stranded DNA:oligonucleotide) in 2.3× Sequenase buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by heating for 3 min at 65 °C and then incubating at 42 °C for 45 min. Reaction conditions were adjusted to 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 6 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2 mm dNTPs, and the DD oligo was extended with Sequenase at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to 20 mm, extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and chloroform, and then ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate. As a control for the efficiency of the DD oligo extension, a parallel reaction was carried out except the DD oligo:linear DNA ratio was ∼1:12, and the DD oligo was 32P-end-labeled. For the DNA displacement assay, the 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide primer was annealed to the DNA displacement template at a molar ratio of 1:2 (primer:template) in annealing buffer (200 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), by heating for 45 min at 67 °C and then for 30 min at 41 °C. The RNA displacement and non-displacement templates were prepared by combining the end-labeled primer with single-stranded linear DNA (or ssLTR2i for NC assays) and in vitro transcribed RNA (RNA displacement template) or TE (non-displacement template) at a molar ratio of 1:1.6:2.7 (primer:template:RNA) and annealing as described above (see also Fig. 2 A). Displacement Assays Using Oligonucleotide Primer-Templates–Synthesis assays contained 10 nmprimer in a 30-μl reaction volume. The annealed short oligonucleotide primer-templates (described above) were preincubated with 200 units of SuperScript II (SSII) in 1× reaction buffer (1× RT buffer, (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2), containing 1 mm DTT and 2% glycerol) for 2 min at 37 °C. Programmed synthesis was initiated by the addition of dATP, dGTP, and dCTP (final concentrations, 200 μm each) in 1× reaction buffer equilibrated to 37 °C. Omission of dTTP directed the termination of synthesis to the first dA residue in the template, found 13 bases beyond the point of initiation. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and 5-μl aliquots were removed and mixed with an equal volume of 95% formamide, 20 mmEDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanole at the indicated times. As a negative control for each assay, T4 DNA polymerase was used in place of SSII. To prevent degradation of the oligonucleotides by the 3′-exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase, the dNTPs were added prior to preincubation, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. For analysis, the samples were heated to ∼95 °C for 3 min, electrophoresed on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis. Calculations were performed using the area integration feature of the ImageQuant software. Full-length products were defined as those fragments ≥29 bases in length. Synthesis assays contained 10 nmprimer, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 200 μm dNTPs (final volume 27–40 μl). For each reaction, the annealed primer-template combination was warmed to 37 °C in the presence of MgCl2, DTT, and bovine serum albumin and, after the addition of 300–400 units of SSII, preincubated for 30 s at 37 °C. Synthesis was initiated by the addition of dNTPs to a final concentration of 200 μm. At the indicated times 5-μl aliquots were added to 15 μl of 98% formamide, 6 mmEDTA, 0.04% xylene cyanole and analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To compare directly M-MuLV RT versusSSII, or for control reactions using T4 DNA polymerase, the dNTPs were added prior to preincubation at 37 °C for 2 min, and synthesis was initiated by the addition of the enzyme. Median and maximum extension lengths were determined essentially as described elsewhere,2 except the unextendable primer (defined as the lowest amount of primer length radioactivity at any time point in the series) was subtracted from the total unextended primer in each sample. The median extension length was defined as the length at which half the products were longer and half were shorter; the maximum length was arbitrarily taken as the length that exceeded 99% of the total products. Extension rates were based on multiple independent experiments and determined by least squares analysis of extension lengths plotted as a function of time. NC assays were carried out using the ssLTR2i template (described above) to avoid adding excess DNA to which NC would potentially bind non-productively outside of the template region. The 5′-32P-labeled primers used were as follows: T730 (1 nm), which anneals immediately upstream of the non-template RNA to create a nicked primer-template, and T7M13 (2.7 nm), which anneals 17 nt upstream of the non-template RNA to form a gapped template. The experiments were carried out as described above except that 1–10 pmol of NCp10 or NCdd were added per fmol of primer to the preincubation mixture. For the “no NC control,” an equivalent volume of NC resuspension buffer (below) was added. When necessary, SSII was diluted in RT dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm DTT, and 20% glycerol). Extension lengths were plotted as a function of time, and the rates were calculated from the steepest portion of each curve. Native M-MuLV NC (NCp10) and mutants NCdd (zinc finger replaced by a Gly-Gly linker) and NC-(19–53) (zinc finger deleted, residues 20–52) were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)-methoxycarbonyl) chemistry as described previously (51De Rocquigny H.

The lyophilized peptides were resuspended in NC resuspension buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 10 μm ZnCl2, and 1 mm DTT) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 205 nm. The NC annealing assay was carried out essentially as described previously (48Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Pernelle C. Borie C. Darlix J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2434-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In a 10-μl reaction, 5 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled R− and 20 fmol of R+ oligonucleotides were incubated in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 μmZnCl2 in the absence of NC or in the presence of 0.15–59 pmol of NC-(19–53), or 0.04–19 pmol of NCdd or NCp10 for 5 min at 37 °C. When required, NC peptides were diluted in NC resuspension buffer. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS to 1.5%, extracted with an equal volume of phenol, 0.2% SDS, and added to 3× loading buffer (19.5% Ficoll, 30 mm EDTA, 0.15% SDS, 0.025% xylene cyanole). The samples were electrophoresed on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C and visualized by autoradiography after exposure of the wet gel to film at −80 °C. To determine whether RT possesses the capacity to displace RNA during DNA synthesis, we examined the efficiency of primer extension by RT on oligonucleotide primer-templates in vitro. In this assay we used the recombinant RNase H− point mutant of M-MuLV RT, SuperScript II (SSII), to avoid the complication of RNase H cleavage of the RNA. RNA displacement primer-templates were created by annealing a 13-mer RNA oligonucleotide (oligo IV) to single-stranded DNA immediat"

https://openalex.org/W2048002152,"We have shown previously that the first transmembrane segment of leader peptidase can function to translocate the polar amino-terminal Pf3 domain across the membrane into the periplasm independently of the proton motive force (pmf) (Lee, J. I., Kuhn, A., and Dalbey, R. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 938–943). We now show that when the first transmembrane segment lacks a strong hydrophobic character, the pmf is required for translocation. In addition, we find that the amino-terminal acidic residue proximal to the transmembrane domain plays a critical role in pmf-dependent amino-terminal translocation. Moreover, the pmf is required to hold the amino-terminal domain in the periplasm to prevent it from slipping such that the amino terminus is no longer exposed to the periplasm. In all cases, translocation occurs under conditions in which the function of the Sec machinery is impaired. These studies show that the low hydrophobicity of the first apolar domain (the translocation signal) can be compensated for by a negative charge in the amino-terminal region, upon which the pmf acts. We have shown previously that the first transmembrane segment of leader peptidase can function to translocate the polar amino-terminal Pf3 domain across the membrane into the periplasm independently of the proton motive force (pmf) (Lee, J.

The mechanisms by which a protein integrates into the membrane and assumes its correct topology has been studied with great interest (1High S. Laird V. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 206-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). It has been shown that membrane proteins in bacteria can utilize the Sec machinery to assemble across the plasma membrane ofEscherichia coli. However, there are a growing number of membrane proteins that apparently do not use the Sec machinery (3Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. von Heijne G. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 380-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This sec-independent class includes membrane proteins that are made without a signal sequence and that are oriented with the amino terminus on the periplasmic side of the plasma membrane (NoutCin orientation). Although the exact mechanism by which these proteins assemble across the membrane is not known, the factors that influence the membrane topology have been elucidated. For example, it has been previously found that the asymmetric distribution of charged residues, particularly basic residues flanking a membrane-spanning domain on the cytoplasmic side, acts as a topogenic determinant for translocation (4von Heijne G.

Negatively charged amino acids, in low abundance, do not inhibit translocation (11Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E.

Several groups have postulated that the membrane topology may be determined by alignment of dipoles and charged groups of the protein within the electrical field of the proton motive force or pmf 1The abbreviations used are: pmf, proton motive force; H1, first hydrophobic domain; lep, leader peptidase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; CCCP, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; OmpA, outer membrane protein A; H, summed hydrophobicity.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This electrophoretic force is a result of the transmembrane electrical gradient, ΔΨ (positive outside, negative inside), which may actively promote translocation of acidic residues (11Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Geller B.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, Kiefer and colleagues (16Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) found that acidic residues in the amino-terminal region of the Pf3 coat protein (NoutCin) are translocated across the membrane by the pmf and can act as topogenic determinants. Another factor that affects membrane insertion of a protein is the overall hydrophobicity (or length) of a transmembrane segment (17Lee E. Manoil C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28822-28828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that apolar residues within hydrophobic domains allow their partitioning into the membrane in an energetically favorable manner, driving insertion (18Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 411-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 19Kuhn A. Kreil G. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3681-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Soekarjo M.

What are the structural requirements for amino-terminal translocation for proteins that lack signal (or leader) peptides? In bacteria, translocation of amino-terminal sequences requires a downstream hydrophobic segment (28Lee J.-I. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 938-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Whitley P. Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29831-29835Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and is most efficient when the amino-terminal region is short (14Cao G. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and contains few positively charged residues (14Cao G. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Whitley P. Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29831-29835Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Typically, the energy source driving translocation is the pmf which is most likely correlated with the acidic charge content of the periplasmic amino-terminal domains. Translocation of amino-terminal segments is believed to be Sec-independent because translocation is unaffected by treatments that block the normal function of the Sec machinery (3Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. von Heijne G. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 380-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, amino-terminal translocation is dependent not only on the charge difference (30Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) between the transmembrane flanking segments with the more positive side typically retained in the cytoplasm but also on the folding state of the amino-terminal domain and the hydrophobicity of the translocation signal (31Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Long hydrophobic sequences favor amino-terminal translocation, whereas short hydrophobic sequences favor carboxyl-terminal translocation (32Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We have used leader peptidase (lep) of Escherichia coli as a model system for studying amino-terminal translocation (14Cao G. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Lee J.-I. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 938-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lep spans the membrane twice with its amino terminus on the periplasmic surface of the membrane and its large carboxyl-terminal domain protruding into the periplasm (28Lee J.-I. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 938-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wolfe P.B. Wickner W. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12073-12080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Moore K.E. Miura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8806-8813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the first hydrophobic domain (H1) of lep can function to translocate a short, polar amino-terminal 18 amino acid antigenic peptide from the phage Pf3 coat protein across the plasma membrane ofEscherichia coli (28Lee J.-I. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 938-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now examined the energetic requirements necessary for the insertion of amino-terminal periplasmic domains and have determined that the hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain and the pmf are both required to varying degrees. E. coli strain MC1061 (ΔlacX74, araD139, Δ(ara,leu)7697, galU, galk, hsr, hsm, strA) was from our laboratory. XL1-blue (supE44, hsdR17,recA1, endA1, gyrA46, thi relA1, lac −) was acquired from Stratagene. Pf3-lep and its derivatives were expressed using the pING plasmids (35Johnston S. Lee J.H. Ray D.S. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which contains the arabinose promoter and the arabinose regulatory elements (Ingene, Inc.). Lysozyme, amino acids, PMSF, and CCCP were purchased from Sigma. DpnI was from New England Biolabs. Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. Proteinase K was from Boehringer Mannheim. Tran35S-label, a mixture of 85% [35S]methionine and 15% [35S]cysteine, 1000 Ci/mmol, was from ICN. Dideoxynucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ampliwax was from Perkin-Elmer. PAGE-purified oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies and Qiagen midi kits were from Qiagen. Site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished using the Stratagene QuikChange procedure with a few alterations. The mutagenesis reaction was physically separated into two portions with Ampliwax beads. The lower portion contained 2.5 μl of the 10-fold reaction buffer, the mutagenic oligonucleotides (125 ng each), deoxynucleotide triphosphates (50 μm each, final concentration), and double distilled water to a final volume of 25 μl. An Ampliwax bead was placed on top, and a wax layer was created by heating and chilling the tube. The upper reagent, administered above the wax layer, contained 2.5 μl of the 10-fold reaction buffer, 50 ng of double-stranded DNA, 1 μl of Pfu DNA polymerase and double distilled water to a final volume of 25 μl. Mutagenesis was then carried out in a Progene thermocycler following the QuikChange protocol. Following DpnI treatment and transformation, mutations were screened by sequencing double-stranded DNA (36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52650) Google Scholar) using U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase version 2.0. Mutant constructs identified by sequencing were then transformed into MC1061 using the calcium chloride method (37Cohen S.N. Chang A.C. Boyer H.W. Helling R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3240-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). MC1061 cells (1 ml) bearing the pING plasmid encoding Pf3-lep proteins were grown to the midlog phase in M9 minimal media (38Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at pH 7.0 with 0.5% fructose and 50 μg/ml of each amino acid except methionine. The cells were induced with arabinose (0.2%, final concentration) for 1 h to express the Pf3-lep mutant proteins. Cells were labeled with 100 μCi oftrans-[35S]methionine for 1 min, chilled on ice, then collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 40 s). After resuspending in 0.25 ml of Tris acetate, pH 8.2, 0.5 m sucrose, and 5 mm EDTA, the cells were treated with lysozyme (80 μg/ml, final concentration) and 0.25 ml of ice-cold water. After incubating for 5 min, 30 μl of 1m MgSO4 were added to stabilize the spheroplasts, and the cells were collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 40 s). The spheroplasts were gently resuspended in 50 mm Tris acetate, 0.25m sucrose, 10 mm MgSO4 and incubated with or without proteinase K (1.5 mg/ml) for 1 h on ice. Another aliquot of spheroplasts was treated with 2% Triton X-100 and incubated with proteinase K (1.5 mg/ml). After quenching the protease with PMSF (5 mm, final concentration) for 5 min, the samples were acid-precipitated and immunoprecipitated with antibody against lep, ribulokinase, a cytoplasmic marker, and outer membrane protein A (OmpA), as described (11Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE with a 15% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to fluorography (39Ito K. Date T. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2123-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorographs were scanned using an AppleOne Scanner. The bands were then quantitated by using the public domain program NIH Image, developed at the National Institutes of Health. 2Available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/. The percent of amino-terminal translocation was determined by taking into account the number of methionines lost during proteolysis by proteinase K. For most of the constructs there was one methionine lost out of eight (see Equations 1, 3, and 4), whereas for Δ4–9, Δ4–22, and the constructs that contain both the amino-terminal domain and the membrane-spanning domain of Pf3 coat there was one methionine lost out of seven (see Equations Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4).Processing(%)=(8/7processed Pf3­lep×100)/(8/7processed Pf3­lep+unprocessed Pf3­lep).Equation 1 Processing(%)=(7/6processed Pf3­lep×100)/(7/6processed Pf3­lep+unprocessed Pf3­lep).Equation 2 Spheroplasts(%)=[1−(OmpA remaining after proteinase K treatment/OmpA remaining after proteinase K treatment+untreated OmpA)]×100.Equation 3 Translocated(%)=(processing%/spheroplast%)×100.Equation 4 The summed hydrophobicity (H) of the transmembrane region flanking the amino-terminal domain was determined as described (17Lee E. Manoil C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28822-28828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the GES scale (40Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). We calculated H for the native and mutant Pf3-lep proteins by adding the hydrophobicity of the uninterrupted stretch of uncharged amino acids within the transmembrane region. The amino terminus of Pf3-lep has previously been shown to translocate in a pmf- and sec-independent manner (28Lee J.-I. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 938-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast to amino-terminal translocation of the sec-independent Pf3 coat protein (see Fig. 1 A for topology), which requires the pmf (41Rohrer J. Kuhn A. Science. 1990; 250: 1418-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the aspartyl residue at position 18 of the amino-terminal domain (16Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) also present in Pf3-lep. Therefore, we have investigated the role of acidic residues in amino-terminal translocation using Pf3-leader peptidase (Pf3-lep) with an F79R mutation as our model protein (Fig. 1 A). This construct contains the 18 amino acid Pf3 region, from the amino terminus of Pf3 coat, fused to the fourth amino acid of leader peptidase (lep) with a threonine linking the two domains (Fig. 1 B). Pf3-lep is oriented in the plasma membrane with the amino-terminal Pf3 domain in the periplasm, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain (H1), and the carboxyl-terminal lep domain in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A). The introduction of an arginine at position 79 of lep inhibits insertion of the second transmembrane domain and translocation of the carboxyl terminus (14Cao G. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Zhu H.-Y. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11833-11838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting protein contains only one translocated region which allows us to monitor translocation of the amino terminus of Pf3-lep across the plasma membrane via protease mapping techniques. We conducted site-directed mutagenesis on the Pf3 domain of Pf3-lep to determine whether a similar requirement for the aspartyl residues existed for efficient translocation of Pf3-lep. We replaced the aspartyl residues at positions 7 and 18 of the Pf3 domain with alanines, either as a single mutation or as a double mutation (Fig. 1 B). Amino-terminal translocation was monitored by protease mapping in the absence or presence of the protonophore CCCP, which destroys the pmf. Expression of Pf3-lep in exponentially growing cells was induced with 0.2% arabinose for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells producing Pf3-lep or aspartyl residue mutants were then pulse-labeled with 100 μCi of35S-trans-labeled methionine for 1 min and then converted to spheroplasts (42Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine translocation in the absence of a pmf, CCCP was added for 45 s prior to labeling. Protease mapping was accomplished by dividing spheroplasts into three equal fractions. The first fraction was incubated on ice for 1 h and then trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. The second fraction was incubated on ice with 1.5 mg/ml proteinase K for 1 h, quenched with PMSF (final concentration, 5 mm), followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The third fraction was treated for 1 h with both 1.5 mg/ml proteinase K and 2% Triton X-100 followed by treatment with PMSF and trichloroacetic acid precipitation. After each sample was divided into two, one-half was immunoprecipitated with anti-leader peptidase antibody and the other half was immunoprecipitated with anti-OmpA and anti-ribulokinase antibodies. The samples were then applied to a 15% SDS-PAGE and the results analyzed by fluorography. As shown in Fig. 2 A, amino-terminal translocation was observed in Pf3-lep (lanes 1–3), 7A Pf3-lep (lanes 4–6), 18A Pf3-lep (lanes 7–9), and 7,18A Pf3-lep (lanes 10–12), in the presence (−CCCP) of a pmf. This is detected by the appearance of a smaller protease-resistant fragment seen in lanes treated with proteinase K (see arrow). Since the proteinase-treated fragments differ by only 18 amino acids, there is a slight shift in molecular weight. These results show that the acidic residues are not required for translocation of the amino terminus of Pf3-lep, in contrast to Pf3-coat protein (16Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When the translocation study is carried out in the absence (+CCCP) of a pmf, amino-terminal translocation is still very efficient as seen in Fig. 2 B(lanes 1–3, 4–6, 7–9, and 10–12). The total amount of translocated domain in the presence or absence of a pmf was quantitated by scanning the fluorograms and using the public domain program NIH Image to determine the percent translocated. As shown in Fig. 1 B, 98% of the proteins translocated their amino-terminal domains efficiently both in the presence and in the absence of a pmf. Successful conversion to spheroplasts was monitored in all experiments by digestion of OmpA, which is exported across the inner membrane and is completely accessible to proteinase K. The integrity of the spheroplasts was determined by monitoring the stability of cytoplasmic ribulokinase in the presence of proteinase K (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the depletion of the proton gradient was demonstrated by the inhibition of pro-OmpA translocation (+CCCP), as the accumulated pro-OmpA is protease-resistant in these studies (Fig. 2 B). Although both Pf3-lep and the Pf3 coat protein contain the same amino-terminal 18 amino acid residues, they do not have the same requirement for aspartic acid residues for efficient amino-terminal translocation. This indicates that there is some other important factor in the lep domain of Pf3-lep that promotes translocation. To determine the role of the hydrophobicity of an NoutCin transmembrane segment in amino-terminal translocation, we constructed several deletion mutations within the transmembrane domain of Pf3-lep. The constructs are shown in Fig. 3 in the order of most hydrophobic to least hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The total hydrophobicity was determined for the uninterrupted stretches of hydrophobic residues (40Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). The hydrophobicity scale used in these studies is the transfer free energy (kcal/mol) of the amino acid side chains from water to a non-aqueous environment. Since the transmembrane domain is more hydrophobic at the amino end than the carboxyl end, deletions at this location are more detrimental to amino-terminal translocation. Protease mapping was then performed as before, in the presence of the pmf (Fig. 4 A). Amino-terminal translocation was quantitated and OmpA and ribulokinase controls were also carried out as before (data not shown). Although Pf3-lep with an intact transmembrane domain translocates efficiently (99%), an effect can already be seen on the translocation of the smallest deletions, Δ17-22 (lanes 1–3) and Δ4-9 (lanes 4–6), with 93 and 91% translocating, respectively. For Δ13-22 (lanes 7–9) and Δ4-12 (lanes 10–12), translocation is roughly half as efficient as it is for the full-length protein (66 and 54%, respectively). Finally, translocation is completely abolished for the larger deletions Δ9-22 (lanes 13–15), Δ4-17 (lanes 16–18), and Δ4-22 (lanes 19–21), showing that the hydrophobicity of a downstream transmembrane domain is essential for amino-terminal translocation.Figure 4Amino-terminal translocation of deletion mutants in which the hydrophobicity of the first transmembrane segment is reduced. E. coli strain MC1061 containing the plasmid encoding Pf3-lep Δ17-22, Δ4-9, Δ13-22, Δ4-12, Δ9-22, Δ4-17, and Δ4-22 was analyzed for amino-terminal translocation either with (A) or without (B) the pmf, as described in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In contrast, when translocation was carried out in the absence of a pmf (CCCP treated cells), only the most hydrophobic mutant, Δ17-22 (lanes 1–3), was partially translocated (54%, Fig. 4 B), whereas the other deletion mutants were completely blocked. Therefore, amino-terminal translocation only occurs with the full-length Pf3-lep and Δ17-22 in the absence of a pmf. This indicates that the pmf can promote membrane insertion of proteins with apolar domains with low hydrophobicity. Although we have shown that negatively charged amino acids are not required for translocation of the amino terminus of Pf3-lep with a full-length transmembrane domain (Fig. 2), we wanted to test whether translocation of the amino terminus of Pf3-lep with a truncated H1 requires the amino-terminal aspartyl residues. This is of particular interest since Δ13-22 requires the presence of a pmf for translocation, as shown in Fig. 4. We used site-directed mutagenesis to create mutations within the Pf3 domain of Δ13-22, by substituting the aspartic acid residues at positions 7 and 18 of the amino-terminal domain with alanines as before (Fig. 5 A). We then conducted protease mapping experiments using cells that were pulse-labeled withtrans-[35S]methionine in the presence and in the absence of the pmf to determine the competency for amino-terminal translocation. Whereas the amino-terminal domains of Δ13-22 and 7A Δ13-22 translocate with equal efficiency in the presence of a pmf, at 66 and 58%, respectively, the amino-terminal domain does not translocate in the 18A Δ13-22 mutant and the double mutant 7,18A Δ13-22 (Fig. 5 B). We should note that the low molecular weight bands observed in lanes 5, 8, and 11 are uncharacterized proteolytic fragments. In the absence of the pmf, translocation of all four of these proteins is abolished (data not shown). Therefore, we found that the acidic residue proximal to the transmembrane domain is absolutely required for pmf-dependent translocation of the amino-terminal domain of Δ13-22 (Pf3-lep with a truncated transmembrane domain), in agreement with the results found for Pf3 coat (16Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This suggests that the pmf is acting on the aspartyl residue at position 18 of the amino-terminal Pf3 domain of Pf3-lep to drive translocation when the hydrophobicity of the membrane-spanning domain is low. We wanted to determine if the pmf was also required to sustain amino-terminal translocation of Pf3-lep in which the hydrophobicity of apolar domain 1 had been decreased. In this study, we characterized Pf3-lep with a full-length transmembrane segment, Δ4-9, which is dependent on the pmf for translocation, and Δ13-22, which had an even stronger defect in translocation as shown in Fig. 4. We pulse labeled a 2-ml culture for 1 min using 200 μCi oftrans-[35S]methionine followed by a 5-min chase of cold methionine (500 μg/ml). One-third of the sample was then chilled, and the remaining cells were treated with 5 μl of 10 mm CCCP for 1 min. At this time, one-half of the remaining sample was then removed and chilled as above, whereas the remaining cell culture was treated with 2-mercaptoethanol to inactivate the CCCP and allow the pmf to regenerate (43Wolfe P.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1984; 36: 1067-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These samples were then washed to remove the 2-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to re-establish the pmf (see figure legend). All the samples were then converted into spheroplasts and protease-mapped as described previously. We found that Pf3-lep with a full-length apolar domain 1 was unaffected by this treatment (Fig. 6 A, lanes 1–9). To our surprise, we found that both Δ4-9 and Δ13-22, which had undergone amino-terminal translocation (91 and 66%, respectively) after a 5-min chase (Fig. 6, B and C, lanes 1–3; denoted as Pulse −CCCP), were not as accessible to protease when the pmf was abolished following pulse labeling (Fig. 6, B and C, lanes 4–6; denoted asPulse + CCCP). We found that the extent to which the amino terminus had “slipped” out of the periplasmic space was correlated with the total amount of hydrophobicity in the apolar domain 1. Although full-length Pf3-lep does not “slip” out from the periplasmic space (hydrophobicity of −46 kcal/mol) when the pmf was abolished, only 62% of Δ4-9 with a total hydrophobicity of −28 kcal/mol (Fig. 3) and none of Δ13-22 with a total hydrophobicity of −25 kcal/mol remain translocated. We are convinced that this effect was due to the abolishment of the pmf because when we allow the pmf to regenerate in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol for 10 min, translocation of the amino-terminal domains is recovered to the same extent as before and are digested by protease (81 and 50%, respectively) Fig. 6, B and C, lanes 7–9(denoted as P/+CCCP 10′ Recover). The results indicate that when the transmembrane domain is not adequately hydrophobic, as in the cases of Δ4-9 and Δ13-22, the pmf is required not only for initiation of amino-terminal translocation but also to sustain translocation of the Pf3 region. We hypothesize that the pmf holds the translocated amino-terminal domain with the proximal acidic residue in the periplasm and therefore prevents this domain from “slipping” out from the periplasmic space. Although the Pf3 coat protein requires a pmf, Pf3-lep does not. One possible reason for this difference is that the transmembrane segment of Pf3 coat is less hydrophobic than that of lep. In view of our results with respect to hydrophobicity, we wanted to determine the outcome of replacing the H1 of lep, with a summed hydrophobicity of −46 kcal/mol, with that of the Pf3 coat protein, which has a hydrophobicity of −39 kcal/mol. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to create this mutant. The Δ4-22 Pf3-lep mutant, in which the first transmembrane domain of lep was deleted, was used as a template for mutagenesis. The insertion of the Pf3 coat transmembrane domain was completed in two rounds of mutagenesis in which nine amino acids were first inserted, followed by the insertion of the remaining nine amino acids. The completed mutant was sequenced and the transmembrane segment was found to be genetically identical to that of the Pf3 coat protein. This mutant protein, Pf3H1-lep, contains the amino-terminal domain and the transmembrane domain of the Pf3 coat protein fused to the 23rd amino acid of lep. Pf3H1-lep was protease-mapped in cells that were analyzed for translocation in the presence and absence of a pmf, as described previously (Fig. 7). Pf3H1-lep translocates efficiently in the presence of a pmf (lanes 1–3) (82%) and is impeded without a pmf (lanes 4–6) (61%). However, it has been shown that translocation of Pf3 coat is abolished in the absence of a pmf (16Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Since lep also has two additional hydrophobic regions (H2 and H3) unlike Pf3 coat, we deleted them to determine if amino-terminal translocation occurs in a manner more similar to that of Pf3 coat. In the presence of a pmf, Pf3H1-lep Δ62-98 translocated with a 99% efficiency (lanes 7–9), and 33% was translocated in the absence of a pmf (lanes 10–12). These results show that pmf-dependent translocation of the amino terminus of Pf3-lep with the transmembrane segment of the Pf3 coat protein is enhanced when H2 and H3 are omitted. We tested whether Pf3-lep becomes dependent on the Sec machinery when the hydrophobicity of the first hydrophobic domain is decreased. To test this, we conducted protease mapping experiments on cells expressing Δ13-22 in which the function of the Sec machinery was compromised. As a control, we confirmed that Pf3-lep with a full-length apolar domain 1 inserts independently of a functioning Sec machinery (14Cao G. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to mid-log phase and induced with arabinose to express the plasmid-encoded proteins for 1 h. The cells were treated with azide for 5 min, followed by pulse labeling for 1 min, and then analyzed by protease mapping; azide has been shown to inhibit the SecA ATPase activity (44Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We show that azide treatment does not affect amino-terminal translocation of either of these proteins (Fig. 8, A and B, lanes 1–3). Furthermore, translocation is not affected in SecAts or SecYts cells when grown at the non-permissive temperature, 42 °C. As shown in Fig. 8 A, Pf3-lep translocates its amino terminus to the same extent in cells with impaired SecA (lanes 4–6) or SecY (lanes 7–9) as in cells with functional SecA and SecY (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–3). Similar results are found with Δ13-22 (Fig. 8 B, lanes 4–9). Under these experimental conditions where the function of SecA or SecY is impaired, the translocation of OmpA is completely blocked as indicated by the fact that pro-OmpA is protease-resistant. These results suggest that amino-terminal translocation occurs in a Sec-independent manner when the transmembrane segment has either high or low hydrophobicity. In this report we have examined why amino-terminal translocation of some proteins, such as Pf3 coat (41Rohrer J. Kuhn A. Science. 1990; 250: 1418-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and ProW (45Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), requires the pmf and leader peptidase (28Lee J.-I. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 938-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) does not. Our results show that when the hydrophobic character of a transmembrane segment is high, amino-terminal translocation occurs independently of the pmf. However, translocation is dependent on the pmf which acts on a negative charge when the hydrophobic character of the transmembrane segment is low. As a general rule, we found that amino-terminal translocation was decreased as the hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain 1 was decreased. Even the deletion of four amino acids had a noticeable affect on translocation, where translocation decreased from 99 to 91%. Almost equally surprising was the finding that amino-terminal translocation could be supported, although less efficiently, by a mutant that contained a stretch of only nine uncharged amino acids, Δ13-22. However, translocation was blocked by decreasing the hydrophobic character further. Strikingly, we observed an increased pmf requirement for translocation when the hydrophobicity of apolar domain 1 was decreased (Figs. 3 and 4). The only mutant that was able to translocate in a pmf-independent manner, Δ17-22, had a very small deletion in the first transmembrane domain. This suggests that it is the overall high hydrophobic content of transmembrane segment 1 of the native leader peptidase that enables translocation of its amino terminus across the membrane independently of the pmf. This may explain the pmf requirement of Pf3 coat (16Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) since the Pf3 coat has a transmembrane segment that is less hydrophobic than the first transmembrane segment of lep. Indeed, we observed pmf-dependent translocation of the amino terminus of Pf3-lep when H1 of lep was replaced with the transmembrane segment of the Pf3 coat protein. The pmf dependence was even more dramatic when the H2 and H3 domains of lep were deleted preventing them from aiding translocation of the amino-terminal domain (Fig. 7). Fig. 9 illustrates the results in which the translocation data of the Pf3-lep mutants are plotted against the hydrophobicity of the respective H1 regions. The hydrophobicity scale of Engelman et al. (40Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) was used to determine the total hydrophobicity. Translocation of the amino-terminal region can occur efficiently in the presence of a pmf (−CCCP) when the summed hydrophobicity of the transmembrane segment exceeds a threshold of roughly −21 kcal/mol, whereas translocation is inefficient even in the presence of a pmf below a threshold of roughly −18 kcal/mol. These results indicating that hydrophobicity of a signal domain is required for translocation of amino-terminal domains are in strong agreement with Lee and Manoil (17Lee E. Manoil C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28822-28828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where they studied an NinCout uncleaved signal of the E. coli serine chemoreceptor (Tsr). In their study, they used a hybrid protein where alkaline phosphatase (phoA) was fused immediately after the first transmembrane segment of Tsr. They found that arginine mutants showing high export of phoA had summed hydrophobicities greater than −23 kcal/mol (for the largest, uninterrupted stretch of hydrophobic amino acids), whereas low export (<15%) of phoA mutants had summed hydrophobicities of less than −23 kcal/mol. We obtained similar results with our single and double arginine mutants (data not shown). The other intriguing finding (see Fig. 9) is that to achieve approximately 50% amino-terminal translocation, a summed H1 hydrophobicity of −21 kcal/mol is required in the presence of the pmf, compared with a summed hydrophobicity of −32 kcal/mol in the absence of the pmf. This suggests that the pmf contributes energy that is equivalent to −11 kcal/mol of hydrophobicity, i.e. four leucine residues. Our results also demonstrate that the amino-terminal aspartyl residue flanking the transmembrane segment is essential for pmf-dependent translocation of Δ13-22. This confirms that aspartic residues can play an active role in amino-terminal translocation as previously suggested (16Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is striking that the pmf is not only required for initiation of translocation but also to stabilize the amino-terminal domain of Δ4-9 and Δ13-22 in the periplasm to prevent it from slipping away from the periplasmic space so that it is not accessible to protease (Fig. 6, B and C). In contrast, slipping is not observed for Pf3-lep which has a transmembrane segment with high hydrophobicity (Fig. 6 A). How the pmf holds the amino-terminal domain on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane is not known at this time. Although it is possible that the amino-terminal polar domain is merely slipping into the membrane bilayer, we think that this would be unlikely because it would be energetically unfavorable for the polar domain to reside within the apolar membrane bilayer. One possible role of a pmf is that it is affects translocation, via direct interaction of the negatively charged residues of the inserting membrane protein, with its electrical potential component (positive outside, negative inside). Our data do not directly address this possibility. However, if such a simple electrophoretic mechanism was operating in E. coli it does not explain why the acidic residue at position 18 would be required and not the one at position 7. A second possibility is that the pmf acts via a transmembrane pH gradient. If this were the case, a protein machinery, which protonates and deprotonates amino acid residues, would most likely be involved. In conclusion, the present data provide strong evidence that the pmf, acting on an acidic residue, can compensate for the low hydrophobicity of the translocation signal. This indicates that hydrophobic forces and proton motive forces work together in the translocation process."
https://openalex.org/W2031946455,"Previous experiments have shown that acidosis enhances isoproterenol-induced phospholamban (PHL) phosphorylation (Mundiña-Weilenmann, C., Vittone, L., Cingolani, H. E., Orchard, C. H. (1996) Am. J. Physiol.270, C107–C114). In the present experiments, performed in isolated Langendorff perfused rat hearts, phosphorylation site-specific antibodies to PHL combined with the quantitative measurement of32P incorporation into PHL were used as experimental tools to gain further insight into the mechanism involved in this effect. At all isoproterenol concentrations tested (3–300 nm), phosphorylation of Thr17 of PHL was significantly higher at pHo 6.80 than at pHo 7.40, without significant changes in Ser16 phosphorylation. This increase in Thr17 phosphorylation was associated with an enhancement of the isoproterenol-induced relaxant effect. In the absence of isoproterenol, the increase in [Ca]o at pHo 6.80 (but not at pHo 7.40) evoked an increase in PHL phosphorylation that was exclusively due to an increase in Thr17 phosphorylation and that was also associated with a significant relaxant effect. This effect and the phosphorylation of Thr17 evoked by acidosis were both offset by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor KN-62. In the presence of isoproterenol, either the increase in [Ca]o or the addition of a 1 μmconcentration of the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid was able to mimic the increase in isoproterenol-induced Thr17phosphorylation produced by acidosis. In contrast, these two interventions have opposite effects on phosphorylation of Ser16. Whereas the increase in [Ca]o significantly decreased phosphorylation of Ser16, the addition of okadaic acid significantly increased the phosphorylation of this residue. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the increase in phospholamban phosphorylation produced by acidosis in the presence of isoproterenol is the consequence of two different mechanisms triggered by acidosis: an increase in [Ca2+]i and an inhibition of phosphatases. Previous experiments have shown that acidosis enhances isoproterenol-induced phospholamban (PHL) phosphorylation (Mundiña-Weilenmann, C., Vittone, L., Cingolani, H. E., Orchard, C. H. (1996) Am. J. Physiol.270, C107–C114).

This increase in Thr17 phosphorylation was associated with an enhancement of the isoproterenol-induced relaxant effect.

Whereas the increase in [Ca]o significantly decreased phosphorylation of Ser16, the addition of okadaic acid significantly increased the phosphorylation of this residue. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the increase in phospholamban phosphorylation produced by acidosis in the presence of isoproterenol is the consequence of two different mechanisms triggered by acidosis: an increase in [Ca2+]i and an inhibition of phosphatases.

Biochem. 1982; 46: 73-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase activity is tonically inhibited by the interaction with another SR protein named phospholamban. In vitro experiments indicate that phosphorylation of phospholamban occurs by either cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) at Ser16 or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) at Thr17 (2Simmerman H.K.

Physiol. 1996; 270: C107-C114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the rat myocardium. Thus, it seems reasonable to consider that the acidosis enhancement of the isoproterenol-induced increase in phospholamban phosphorylation could be due to a further increase either in Ser16phosphorylation (by inhibition of PP1) and/or in Thr17phosphorylation (by inhibition of PP1 and/or activation of CaMKII). In this work, immunodetection of site-specific phosphorylated phospholamban was used in combination with the classical isotopic labeling technique of quantification of phospholamban phosphorylation to investigate the contribution of each phosphorylation site of phospholamban to the increase in the isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of this protein evoked by acidosis. The possible mechanisms involved in this effect were also explored. Simultaneous measurements of mechanical parameters will provide a clue to the functional consequences of the effects observed. Experiments were performed in isolated hearts from male Wistar rats (250–350 g of body weight) perfused according to the Langendorff technique as described previously (13Vittone L. Mundiña C. Chiappe de Cingolani G. Mattiazzi A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H318-H325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The composition of the physiological salt solution (PSS) was 128.3 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.35 mmCaCl2, 20.2 mm NaHCO3, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 1.1 mmMgCl2, 11.1 mm glucose, and 0.04 mmNa2EDTA; this solution was equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 to give an extracellular pH (pHo) of 7.40 ± 0.01 or with 80% O2 and 20% CO2 (pHo 6.80 ± 0.02) in the experiments of hypercapnic acidosis. The mechanical activity of the heart was assessed by passing into the left ventricle a latex balloon connected to a pressure transducer (Namic, Perceptor DT disposable transducer). The balloon was filled with aqueous solution to achieve a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 8–14 mm Hg. Isovolumic pressure and its first derivative were recorded on a four-channel pen recorder (Gould Model RS 3400) fitted with a transducer amplifier (Gould Model 13-4615-50) and a differentiating amplifier (Gould Model 13-4615-71). Hearts were perfused with PSS at pHo 7.40 for 10–15 min for stabilization and then for the next 3 min with either PSS (control) or different interventions as described under “Results.” To quantify32P incorporation into phospholamban, hearts were perfused for 60 min by recirculation with PSS containing 10 μCi/ml32Pi after the stabilization period and previously to the interventions assessed. At the end of the experimental period, the ventricles were freeze-clamped, pulverized, and stored at −70 °C until biochemical assay. Membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (13Vittone L. Mundiña C. Chiappe de Cingolani G. Mattiazzi A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H318-H325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the pulverized tissue from each heart was homogenized in 6 volumes of a medium containing 30 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0 at 4 °C), 5 mm Na2EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine. Samples from32P-perfused hearts were homogenized in the same medium, except that the phosphate was replaced by 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) at 4 °C. Protein was measured by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The yield was 1–2 mg of membrane vesicle protein/g of cardiac tissue. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using 10% acrylamide slab gels according to Porzio and Pearson (20Porzio M.A. Pearson A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) as described previously (13Vittone L. Mundiña C. Chiappe de Cingolani G. Mattiazzi A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H318-H325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples for electrophoresis were not boiled unless stated. For immunological detection of phospholamban phosphorylation sites, 10 μg of membrane protein were electrophoresed per gel lane. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.) and probed as described previously (5Mundiña-Weilenmann C. Vittone L. Ortale M.

Immunoreactivity was visualized by peroxidase-conjugated antibodies using a peroxidase-based chemiluminescence detection kit (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). The signal intensity of the bands on the film was quantified by optical densitometric analysis. To assess 32P incorporation into phospholamban, 300 μg of membrane protein were electrophoresed per gel lane. Gels were run in duplicate to use one of them for autoradiography and the other for liquid scintillation counting. Quantitative results are expressed as picomoles of 32P incorporated into phospholamban/mg of SR protein based on the specific activity of 32P in phosphocreatine (22Barron J.T. Bárány M. Bárány K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4954-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of n preparations. Student's t test for unpaired observations was used to test for statistical differences. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Fig. 1 A shows the overall results of 32P incorporation into phospholamban obtained from SR membrane vesicles isolated from hearts perfused with 32P and then in the absence and presence of 30 nm isoproterenol at pHo 7.40 and 6.80. In agreement with previous findings (16Mundiña-Weilenmann C. Vittone L. Cingolani H.E. Orchard C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C107-C114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), acidosis did not increase basal phospholamban phosphorylation, but significantly enhanced isoproterenol-induced phospholamban phosphorylation. Fig. 1 B shows immunoblots of SR membrane vesicles obtained from hearts perfused under the same conditions of Fig. 1 A. Immunodetection of phosphorylation sites of phospholamban indicated that the acidosis-induced increase in phospholamban phosphorylation was exclusively due to an increase in phosphorylation of Thr17. Similar results were obtained when two other different isoproterenol concentrations were explored as shown in Fig. 2. At all isoproterenol concentrations, acidosis significantly increased phosphorylation of Thr17 of phospholamban without affecting phosphorylation of Ser16. In the absence of isoproterenol, acidosis induced a slight and nonsignificant increase in Thr17phosphorylation and did not modify Ser16 phosphorylation. Table I shows the mechanical parameters of this experimental series. Acidosis induced a decrease in the maximal rate of contraction (+P˙) in both the absence and presence of isoproterenol. Moreover, acidosis produced an enhancement of the isoproterenol-induced relaxant effect (decrease int½), which attained significant levels at 30 nm isoproterenol. This relaxant effect of acidosis may be due at least in part to the significant increase in the phosphorylation of Thr17 produced by acidosis (see below). In the absence of isoproterenol, the decrease in t½ produced by acidosis was not associated with any significant increase in phosphorylation of phospholamban and should therefore be attributed to mechanisms unrelated to the phosphorylation of this protein, such as a decrease in the calcium sensitivity of the myofilaments as suggested by previous results (16Mundiña-Weilenmann C.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 Ashows immunoblots of SR membrane vesicles obtained from hearts perfused in the absence and presence of isoproterenol at [Ca]o = 1.35 mm and in the presence of isoproterenol at [Ca]o= 3.85 mm. Fig. 3 B shows the overall results of 10 different experiments of this type. Increasing [Ca]o in the presence of isoproterenol significantly increased phosphorylation of Thr17. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation of Ser16 was significantly decreased. The opposite effects of increasing [Ca]o in the presence of isoproterenol on phosphorylation of phospholamban residues may explain the small effect of this maneuver on total phospholamban phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4, increasing [Ca]o from 1.35 to 3.85 mm evoked a small and nonsignificant increase in the phosphorylation of phospholamban induced by isoproterenol. Table I depicts the mechanical results of this experimental series. The increase in calcium supply to the cell in the presence of 30 nm isoproterenol did not modify the isoproterenol-induced increase in either contractility or relaxation. This result is consistent with the lack of effect of increasing [Ca]o in the presence of isoproterenol on total phospholamban phosphorylation as quantified by 32P incorporation into phospholamban (Fig. 4).Figure 4Overall results of 32P incorporation into phospholamban under the same conditions described for Fig. 3. The increase in [Ca]o failed to significantly enhance phospholamban phosphorylation above the level achieved with isoproterenol at [Ca]o = 1.35 mm. The number of experiments in each treatment group is indicated inparentheses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The decrease in Ser16 phosphorylation produced by increasing [Ca]o in the presence of isoproterenol did not occur during acidosis. This result suggests that other mechanisms triggered by the acidosis may be playing a role. One of these putative mechanisms is the acidosis-induced inhibition of phosphatases, which might be offsetting the effect of an increase in [Ca2+]i on Ser16 phosphorylation. In the next two sections, we will therefore explore the possible role of phosphatases in the acidosis enhancement of isoproterenol-induced phospholamban phosphorylation. Fig. 5 A shows immunoblots of SR membrane vesicles obtained from hearts perfused at two different isoproterenol concentrations, 3 and 30 nm (pHo7.40), in the absence and presence of 1 μm okadaic acid, a PP1 inhibitor. To compare the effects of okadaic acid with those of acidosis, SR membranes obtained from hearts perfused at 3 and 30 nm isoproterenol at pHo 6.80 were run in parallel. As already shown in Fig. 2, acidosis enhanced only isoproterenol-induced Thr17 phosphorylation without affecting Ser16 phosphorylation. In contrast, okadaic acid enhanced the isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of both Ser16 and Thr17 at the two isoproterenol concentrations. Fig. 5 B shows the mean values obtained by optic densitometric analysis of the different experiments of this series. These findings revealed that the sole inhibition of phosphatases by okadaic acid has a different effect on phosphorylation of Ser16 than that produced by acidosis. They also showed that even at the higher isoproterenol concentration used, which produced the maximum phosphorylation of phospholamban at pHo7.40 (5Mundiña-Weilenmann C. Vittone L. Ortale M. Chiappe de Cingolani G. Mattiazzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33561-33567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), phosphatases are not maximally inhibited. Evidence for an enhancement of the isoproterenol-induced increase in phospholamban phosphorylation produced by okadaic acid has been previously reported in isolated myocytes (10Neumann J. Boknik P. Herzig S. Schmitz W. Scholz H. Gupta R.C. Watanabe A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 275: H257-H266Google Scholar). The present results further showed that this increase in phospholamban phosphorylation is due to the simultaneous increase in the phosphorylation of both Thr17 and Ser16 of phospholamban. Table I shows the effects of okadaic acid in the presence of isoproterenol on the mechanical parameters of contraction and relaxation. At both isoproterenol concentrations, okadaic acid produced a further decrease in the isoproterenol-induced decrease oft½. This reduction attained significant levels at 3 nm isoproterenol. Okadaic acid also significantly increased the positive inotropic effect of this isoproterenol concentration without affecting the effect of 30 nmisoproterenol on contractility. The rationale behind this group of experiments was to study the effects of stimulating the CaMKII pathway of phospholamban phosphorylation in the absence of the inhibition of phosphatases produced by cAMP-dependent mechanisms (7Hubbard M.J.

Previous experiments have shown that in the absence of isoproterenol, the increase in [Ca]o did not phosphorylate phospholamban unless the phosphatases were inhibited. This was so even when the increase in contractility (and therefore cytosolic calcium) was similar to that evoked by isoproterenol or more prolonged as during tetani (5Mundiña-Weilenmann C.

Thus, any increase in phospholamban phosphorylation produced by increasing [Ca]o at low pHo would strongly suggest a significant role of the acidosis-induced inhibition of phosphatases in this effect. Fig. 6 shows the overall results of the experiments performed in SR membrane vesicles from hearts perfused with 32P and then at low and high [Ca]o at pHo 7.40 and 6.80. The increase in [Ca]o significantly increased phosphorylation of phospholamban only under acidotic conditions. Fig. 7 A shows immunoblots of SR membrane vesicles isolated from hearts perfused as described for Fig. 6, except that 32P perfusion was omitted. Immunological detection of the two phosphorylation sites of phospholamban showed that the increase in phospholamban phosphorylation observed in Fig. 6 was exclusively due to the phosphorylation of Thr17. The overall results of this series are shown in Fig. 7 B. Table Ishows the mechanical results of this experimental series. Acidosis produced a significant decrease in +P˙ and t½ at [Ca]o = 1.35 mm that was not associated with any significant increase in phospholamban phosphorylation. At [Ca]o = 3.85 mm, acidosis produced a decrease in +P˙ similar to that produced at low [Ca]o and a significant decrease in t½ that occurred in association with the increase in Thr17 phosphorylation.Figure 7A, immunoblots of SR membrane vesicles isolated from rat hearts perfused as described for Fig. 6. Site-specific phosphorylation produced by 30 nmisoproterenol (Iso) is shown for comparison. B, overall results obtained after densitometric analysis of the signal of three immunoblots. At [Ca]o = 1.35 mm, acidosis failed to significantly increase either Ser16 or Thr17 phosphorylation. At [Ca]o = 3.85 mm, acidosis did not affect Ser16phosphorylation, but produced an evident enhancement of Thr17 phosphorylation, which would account for the increase in total PHL phosphorylation observed in Fig. 6. PSer 16 -PHL and PThr 17 -PHL, anti-Ser16 and anti-Thr17 PHL phosphopeptides, respectively;PHLH and PHLL, pentameric and monomeric forms of PHL, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Table I, the acidosis-induced relaxant effect at high [Ca]o in the absence of isoproterenol was not greater than at [Ca]o = 1.35 mm, as would be expected from the significant increase in Thr17 phosphorylation observed at high [Ca]o. Similarly, the decrease in t½ induced by acidosis in the presence of isoproterenol was not higher than that produced by acidosis in the absence of the β-agonist. To further explore this point, additional experiments were performed in which the effect of acidosis on Thr17 phosphorylation and t½ was studied at high [Ca]o in the presence and absence of a 10 μm concentration of the CaMKII inhibitor KN-62. In these experiments, acidosis produced an increase in Thr17 phosphorylation (expressed as percent of the phosphorylation of Thr17 at 30 nmisoproterenol, run in parallel) from 24.6 ± 8.3 to 82.4 ± 19.8%, which returned to control levels (28.6 ± 10.9%) in the presence of 10 μm KN-62 (n = 5). These changes in Thr17 phosphorylation were paralleled by changes in t½. The correspondingt½ values were 65.3 ± 4.1, 55.3 ± 4.4, and 66.0 ± 4.9 ms at high [Ca]o, high [Ca]o + acidosis, and high [Ca]o + acidosis + KN-62, respectively. These results indicated that the increase in Thr17phosphorylation evoked by acidosis was closely associated with a relaxant effect. It is possible that at high [Ca2+]i levels, as should occur at high [Ca]o and in the presence of isoproterenol, the tension developed by the contractile proteins may be close to or at the “plateau” of the [Ca2+]i-tension curve. Under these conditions, the acidosis-induced decrease in myofilament calcium sensitivity and the resultant relaxant effect might be minimized. This effect would be further minimized in the presence of isoproterenol by the decrease in myofilament calcium sensitivity produced by the β-agonist. Phosphorylation site-specific antibodies have proven to be highly specific in the discrimination between the two sites of phosphorylation of phospholamban since no cross-reactivity with the other site of phosphorylation was observed (5Mundiña-Weilenmann C. Vittone L. Ortale M. Chiappe de Cingolani G. Mattiazzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33561-33567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The combination of this technique with the quantification of 32P incorporation into phospholamban along with simultaneous measurements of mechanical parameters constitute invaluable tools to characterize the underlying mechanisms of phospholamban phosphorylation and their regulation. Isoproterenol-induced phospholamban phosphorylation has been shown to be dependent upon the acid-base status of the myocardium, with acidosis enhancing the increase in phospholamban phosphorylation produced by the β-adrenergic agonist (Ref. 16Mundiña-Weilenmann C. Vittone L. Cingolani H.E. Orchard C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C107-C114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and our results in Fig. 1 A). The relevant findings of this study were that the increase in the isoproterenol-induced phospholamban phosphorylation produced by acidosis was exclusively due to an increase in phosphorylation of Thr17 of phospholamban (Figs. 1 B and 2) and that this increase would contribute to the enhancement of the relaxant effect of isoproterenol evoked by acidosis (Table I). The results also provided evidence that an activation of CaMKII and an inhibition of phosphatases may have both played a significant role in the observed increase in Thr17 phosphorylation produced by acidosis in the presence of isoproterenol. Phosphorylation of phospholamban depends on a basic mechanism that is common to any phosphorylation process, i.e. the relative activities of kinases and phosphatases that phosphorylate and dephosphorylate the protein, respectively. β-Adrenoreceptor stimulation increases phospholamban phosphorylation by increasing the phosphorylation of both Ser16 and Thr17 (4Wegener A.D. Simmerman H.K.B. Lindemann J.P. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11468-11474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mundiña-Weilenmann C. Vittone L. Ortale M. Chiappe de Cingolani G. Mattiazzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33561-33567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Different types of evidence further indicate that this dual phosphorylation occurs because isoproterenol not only increases PKA activity, but as a consequence of PKA activation, also produces a simultaneous activation of CaMKII (by increasing [Ca2+]i) and inhibition of PP1, the major phosphatase that dephosphorylates phospholamban (6MacDougall L.K.

In this context and in the search for the mechanisms underlying the enhancement of the isoproterenol-induced phospholamban phosphorylation produced by acidosis, two possibilities should be necessarily explored: 1) acidosis produces a further increase in CaMKII activity, and/or 2) acidosis evokes a further inhibition of PP1. Both possibilities have some experimental support (16Mundiña-Weilenmann C. Vittone L. Cingolani H.E. Orchard C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C107-C114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Harrison S.M.

Res. 1994; 28: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This increase in [Ca2+]i may add to the increase in [Ca2+]i produced by isoproterenol to further activate CaMKII. Second, it has also been shown that acidosis inhibits PP1. A decrease in pHo from 7.40 to 6.80 produced by increasing the CO2 of the gas mixture from 5 to 20% (external bicarbonate of 18.5 mm) has been reported to produce a decrease in pHi from 7.14 to ∼6.70 in isolated cat and guinea pig myocytes (23Spitzer K.W. Bridge J.H.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C316-C327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained by us in experiments performed in rat isolated myocytes under the same conditions described in the present experiments. In these experiments, the pHi decreased from 7.18 ± 0.06 to 6.73 ± 0.04. 2L. Vittone, C. Mundiña-Weilenmann, M. Said, and A. Mattiazzi, unpublished results. In this pHi range, we have previously shown in in vitro experiments that PP1 was inhibited by acidosis by ∼30% (16Mundiña-Weilenmann C. Vittone L. Cingolani H.E. Orchard C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C107-C114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous results have shown that the increase in [Ca]o produced an increase in Thr17 phosphorylation only when the phosphatases were inhibited as in the presence of okadaic acid (5Mundiña-Weilenmann C. Vittone L. Ortale M. Chiappe de Cingolani G. Mattiazzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33561-33567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, acidosis produced effects similar to those observed with okadaic acid: the activation of CaMKII by increasing [Ca]o in the absence of isoproterenol evoked an increase in Thr17 phosphorylation only under acidotic conditions (Fig. 7). This finding indicates that the acidosis-induced inhibition of phosphatases played a significant role in the increase in Thr17 phosphorylation observed. Moreover, the increase in Thr17 phosphorylation was closely paralleled by a relaxant effect. The fact that, at [Ca]o = 1.35 mm, acidosis did not produce any significant change in either Ser16 or Thr17 means that for the level of phosphatase inhibition produced by acidosis, the activity of kinases was too low to increase the hosphorylation of the corresponding residues. The acidosis enhancement of isoproterenol-induced Thr17phosphorylation could be mimicked by either increasing [Ca]o(Fig. 3) or adding okadaic acid (Fig. 5). These findings indicated that the CaMKII cascade can be activated above the level achieved by stimulation with isoproterenol and that even at the higher isoproterenol concentration used, phosphatases are not maximally inhibited by cAMP and therefore can be further inhibited by acidosis. However, neither the increase in [Ca]o nor the presence of okadaic acid mimicked the lack of effect of acidosis on Ser16. Whereas okadaic acid significantly enhanced the isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of Ser16, the increase in [Ca]o significantly decreased it. The results obtained on phosphorylation of Ser16 under the different experimental situations are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that acidosis was acting by two different mechanisms, i.e.the increase in [Ca2+]i and the inhibition of phosphatases, both of which contribute to the increase in Thr17 phosphorylation, but have opposite effects on Ser16 phosphorylation. The decrease in Ser16 phosphorylation when [Ca]o was increased in the presence of isoproterenol (Fig. 3) was an unexpected finding that deserves some additional comments. 1) The result is in line with the fact that the increase in [Ca]o in the presence of the β-agonist failed to significantly increase total phospholamban phosphorylation (Fig. 4) and myocardial relaxation (Table I) above the levels attained by β-adrenoreceptor stimulation. 2) As discussed above, the result is also consistent with the idea that both the activation of CaMKII and the inhibition of phosphatases have contributed to the enhancement of the isoproterenol-induced Thr17 phosphorylation produced by acidosis. The cause for this decrease in Ser16 phosphorylation is not apparent to us. The inhibition of type V adenylyl cyclase, the major adenylyl cyclase isoform present in adult ventricle (24Espinasse I. Iourgenko V. Defer N. Samson F. Hanoune J. Mercadier J.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 1789-1795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), by submicromolar concentrations of calcium has been previously described (25Yoshimura M. Cooper D.M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, this possibility is not supported by previous experiments in our laboratory showing that the increase in [Ca]o did not affect intracellular cAMP levels (14Napolitano R. Vittone L. Mundiña C. Chiappe de Cingolani G. Mattiazzi A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1992; 24: 387-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Another possible clue to explain the above findings can be found in the mechanisms regulating PP1 activity. SR-associated PP1 could be inhibited by direct PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the PP1 regulatory subunit and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of inhibitor-1, which in the phosphorylated state is a potent inhibitor of the catalytic subunit of PP1 (8Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). In turn, the PP1 regulatory subunit and inhibitor-1 are dephosphorylated by two other phosphatases, PP2A and PP2B (8Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). Since PP2B is activated by calcium and calmodulin, the increase in [Ca2+]i is a potential mechanism by which PP1 can be activated (8Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the inhibitory effect of PKA on PP1 would be attenuated. This phosphatase regulatory cascade might explain the decrease in the phosphorylation of Ser16 when [Ca2+]i was increased. This decrease may not occur in acidosis if it is overrided by acidosis-induced phosphatase inhibition. The decrease in isoproterenol-induced Ser16 phosphorylation by increasing [Ca]o (Fig. 3) may therefore be the expression of a mechanism by which the increase in [Ca2+]i, acting through a protein phosphatase cascade, attenuates the signals that act via cAMP (8Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 26Cohen P. Cohen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21435-21438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)."

Here, we show that the snake contains a single gene for AChE, possessing a novel alternative exon (S) that encodes the C-terminal region of the venom enzyme, located downstream of the T exon. Alternative splicing generates S mRNA in the venom gland and S and T mRNAs in muscle and liver. We found no evidence for the presence of an H exon between the last common “catalytic” exon and the T exon, where H exons are located in Torpedo and in mammals. Moreover, COS cells that were transfected with AChE expression vectors containing the T exon with or without the preceding genomic region produced exclusively AChET subunits. In the snake tissues, we could not detect any glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored AChE form that would have derived from H subunits. In the liver, the cholinesterase activity comprises both AChE and butyrylcholinesterase components; butyrylcholinesterase corresponds essentially to nonamphiphilic tetramers and AChE to nonamphiphilic monomers (G1na). In muscle, AChE is largely predominant: it consists of globular forms (G1a and G4a) and trace amounts of asymmetric forms (A8 and A12), which derive from AChET subunits. Thus, the Bungarus AChE gene possesses alternatively spliced T and S exons but no H exon; the absence of an H exon may be a common feature of AChE genes in reptiles and birds.

(EC 3.1.1.7) is an essential component of cholinergic synapses, in the nervous tissues and muscles of vertebrates (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.M. Prog. Neurosci. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). This enzyme is also found in nonsynaptic contexts, where its function is unclear. In the blood of mammals, AChE exists in the form of soluble tetramers (G4na), probably originating from the liver, and of membrane-bound dimers (G2a), anchored by a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) to the surface of erythrocytes and lymphocytes (2Toutant J.P. Massoulié J. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1988; 86: 225-265Crossref Google Scholar); these enzymes could serve as a safeguard against any diffusion of acetylcholine from synapses into the circulation. The venoms of various Elapidae from the genera Bungarus,Hemachatus, Naja, and Ophiophagus represent a particularly rich source of nonsynaptic AChE (3Iwanaga S. Suzuki T. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1979; 52: 61-158Crossref Google Scholar, 4Frobert Y. Créminon C. Cousin X. Rémy M.H. Chatel J.M. Bon S. Bon C. Grassi J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1339: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The presence of AChE in snake venoms is mysterious because it is nontoxic by itself and does not enhance the toxicity of other venom components. This enzyme has been characterized as a true AChE, possessing the characteristic catalytic activity of AChEs from cholinergic tissues of other species: it hydrolyses acetylcholine faster than propionylcholine or butyrylcholine and it is inhibited by eserine (5Cousin X. Créminon C. Grassi J. Méflah K. Cornu G. Saliou B. Bon S. Massoulié J. Bon C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, the primary sequences of Naja and Bungarus venom AChEs present a strong homology to those of other AChEs, as shown by analysis of partial peptidic sequences (5Cousin X. Créminon C. Grassi J. Méflah K. Cornu G. Saliou B. Bon S. Massoulié J. Bon C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Weise C. Kreienkamp H.J. Raba R. Pedak A. Aaviksaar A. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3885-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and by analysis of the complete sequence of Bungarus AChE deduced from cDNA clones (7Cousin X. Bon S. Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15099-15108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The cloning of AChE from Bungarus venom revealed, however, that this homology is limited to the catalytic domain and that the C-terminal sequence is entirely different from both C-terminal H- and T-peptides, which are encoded by alternatively spliced exons in the single AChE gene and characterize AChEH and AChET subunits of other vertebrates (review in Ref. 1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.M. Prog. Neurosci. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). These C-terminal peptides determine the mode of posttranslational processing and quaternary associations of AChE catalytic subunits. Thus, AChEH subunits are modified by cleavage and addition of a GPI anchor, as well as by the formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond, generating GPI-anchored dimers (8Futerman A.H. Low M.G. Michaelson D.M. Silman I. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The AChET subunits produce monomers and a variety of disulfide-linked oligomeric forms, including homo-oligomers (dimers or tetramers) and hetero-oligomers, which incorporate structural collagen subunits (collagen-tailed forms) or hydrophobic subunits (hydrophobic-tailed tetramers). These hetero-oligomeric forms are tethered to extracellular matrices at neuromuscular synapses (9Bon S. Cartaud J. Massoulié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or attached to cellular membranes, particularly in the brain (10Gennari K. Brunner J. Brodbeck U. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The T-peptide may adopt an amphiphilic α helical structure, thus explaining the observation that monomers and dimers of AChET subunits can interact with detergent micelles and membranes phospholipids (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.M. Prog. Neurosci. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). In contrast with all molecular forms that are normally produced by AChEH and AChETsubunits, the venom AChE consists of soluble, hydrophilic monomers. This is clearly related to the fact that the venom AChE possesses a specific C-terminal peptide, which we called SARA after its last four residues: this peptide is highly hydrophilic and does not contain any cysteine residue that could establish intersubunit disulfide bonds. It defines AChES subunits, which produce only soluble monomers when expressed in COS cells (7Cousin X. Bon S. Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15099-15108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The presence of the SARA sequence, replacing the H or T sequences, which are encoded by alternative exons in Torpedoand mammalian AChE genes, raises the problem of the relationship between the venom enzyme and the AChE molecules that occur in cholinergic synapses of the snake. Several hypotheses may be considered to explain the production of this unusual type of AChE in venom glands. First, although previously studied vertebrates possess a single AChE gene (11Sikorav J.L. Krejci E. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1865-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Rotundo R.L. Gomez A.M. Fernandez-Valle C. Randall W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 1990; 5: 317-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14Li Y. Camp S. Rachinsky T.L. Getman D. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23083-23090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the snake might possess two distinct AChE genes, expressed in cholinergic tissues and the venom glands, respectively. Such a duplication would be similar to the duplication of cholinesterase genes, which generate the twin enzymes AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) (EC 3.1.1.8) in vertebrates (15Cousin X. Toutant J.P. Jbilo O. Chatonnet A. Arpagaus M. Massoulié J. Bacou F. Barnard E. Chatonnet A. Doctor B.P. Quinn D.M. Cholinesterases: Structure, Function, Mechanism, Genetics, and Cell Biology. American Chemical Society, Washington DC1991: 195Google Scholar). Second, the venom enzyme may derive from the same gene as AChE in other tissues. In this case, the SARA sequence could be encoded by a novel type of alternative exon or by “readthrough” transcripts. Readthrough transcripts, in which the genomic sequence following the common catalytic exons is maintained, have been characterized inTorpedo electric organs (16Sikorav J.L. Duval N. Anselmet A. Bon S. Krejci E. Legay C. Osterlund M. Reimund B. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2983-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), in mouse MEL cells (13Rachinsky T.L. Camp S. Li Y. Ekstrom T.J. Newton M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1990; 5: 317-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and embryonic diaphragm (17Legay C. Huchet M. Massoulié J. Changeux J.P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and in rat embryonic liver (18Legay C. Bon S. Vernier P. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Readthrough transcripts are expected to produce nonamphiphilic, monomeric AChE, but the corresponding proteins have never been characterized in vivo. In the present report, we show that Bungarus possesses a single AChE gene containing a novel alternative exon, S, localized downstream of the T exon. We identified the alternative splicing of the AChE transcripts in the venom glands, the liver, and the muscles, and we characterized the resulting molecular forms in vivo, as well as in COS cells expressing various constructs. Bungarus fasciatus snakes were kindly provided by Prof. Xiong Yu-Liang and Dr. Zhang Yun (Kunming Institute of Zoology, Academia Sinica, Kunming, Yunnan, China). They were sacrificed in China, and the tissues (venom gland, muscle and liver) were immediately frozen and transported in dry ice. Total RNA was extracted using RNAsol (Bioprobe), according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). For reverse transcription-PCR experiments, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using 200 units of Superscript-Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10 pmol of oligo-dT, 2 pmol of specific primer, or 25 pmol of hexanucleotides, as described in the legend to Fig. 4. PCR was performed essentially as described previously (7Cousin X. Bon S. Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15099-15108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with Taq polymerase from Promega in a PTC150 thermocycler (M. J. Research). For RNase protection assays, we introduced exon 4 and the T or S exon, under control of T7 promoter to produce antisense probes. 10 μg of these constructs (described in Fig. 5) were digested overnight with 20 units of EcoRI in a final volume of 30 μl. The DNA was extracted with phenol and chloroform and then precipitated by ethanol in the presence of ammonium acetate. DNA was resuspended in 20 μl of RNase-free water and quantified using a GeneQuant spectrophotometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For probe synthesis, 3 μg of DNA were incubated with 100 μCi of [32P]dUTP (800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 150 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) during 1 h at 37 °C and then digested using 2 units of RNase-free DNase (Ambion). The probe was purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and eluted for 2 h at 37 °C in a solution containing 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 0.2% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA. Total RNA (10 μg) was then co-precipitated overnight with 100,000 cpm of probe (200,000 cpm in the case of venom gland RNA, in which the AChE mRNA is more abundant) with 0.5m ammonium acetate. The pellet was then resuspended in Hybspeed buffer (Ambion). Further incubations and RNase digestions were performed following precisely the instructions of the manufacturer. Samples of the reaction mixtures were then loaded on a sequencing denaturing polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to a Fuji imaging plate, which was read after 1 h. Each band was then quantified using the TINA program. The signal was corrected according to the amount in U bases in the protected fragment. Tissues and transfected cells were extracted in a low salt detergent buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100), and in some cases the pellet was re-extracted in a high salt buffer (same as above, with 1 m NaCl). AChE and BChE were analyzed by sedimentation in 5–20% sucrose gradients containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 5 mmMgCl2, either without detergent or in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100 or 1% Brij-96. AChE and BChE activities were assayed in the presence of specific inhibitors as indicated below. For analysis of asymmetric forms, the gradients contained 0.4 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100. E. coli alkaline phosphatase (6.1 S) and E. coli β-galactosidase (16 S) were included as internal sedimentation standards. After centrifugation at 36,000 rpm for 18 h at 7 °C in a Beckman SW41 rotor, 45 fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes and assayed for the different enzymatic activities. Electrophoresis in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels was performed as described previously (24Bon S. Toutant J.P. Méflah K. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Bon S. Toutant J.P. Méflah K. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The gels contained 0.25% Triton X-100 with or without 0.05% deoxycholate, and they were electrophoresed for approximately 2–3 h under 15 V/cm, with cooling at 15 °C. AChE activity was revealed by the histochemical method of Karnovsky and Roots (26Karnovsky M.J. Roots L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2993) Google Scholar). Collagenase form III (27Miller R.L. Udenfriend S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 139: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was purchased from Advance Biofactures Co. (Lynnbrook, NJ). A high salt extract containing AChE was incubated with 40 units of collagenase in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 5 mm CaCl2, for 1 h at 26 °C. Treatment with PI-PLC was performed as described previously (28Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). AChE and BChE were assayed by the colorimetric method of Ellman et al. (29Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21370) Google Scholar). Acetylthiocholine was used as a substrate for both enzymes. AChE was assayed in the presence of the specific anti-BChE inhibitor iso-OMPA (10−5m), and BChE was assayed in the presence of the specific anti-AChE inhibitor BW284C51 (1,5-bis(4-allyldimethylammoniumphenyl)-pentan-3-one dibromide) (10−5m). Genomic DNA was extracted and isolated by a salting-out protocol (30Miller R.L. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17845) Google Scholar): liver was crushed in liquid nitrogen and transferred in 10 volumes of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1m EDTA, 20 μg/ml pancreatic RNase, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5m NaCl) and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min. Proteinase K was added at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, and incubation was performed overnight at 50 °C. Saturated NaCl (>6 m) was then added (¼ volume) and agitated. After centrifugation (15 min at 5000 rpm), 2 volumes of cold ethanol were added to the supernatant, which was then kept on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation (15 min at 5000 rpm), the DNA pellet was redissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer. PCR was performed with primer oligonucleotides corresponding to sequences of exons 3, 4, T, and S. To search for the presence of a putative exon H between exons 4 and T, we made several constructs by inserting various 3′ sequences, using a unique BglII site, located in exon 4, as shown in Fig. 7. COS cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method, as reported previously (31Bon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3007-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), using 5 μg of DNA encoding the catalytic subunit AChET with or without DNA encoding the QN/HC binding protein (31Bon S.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3255-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), as specified. The cells were maintained at 37 °C and extracted 2–4 days after transfection. The culture medium (7 ml/10-cm dish containing about 5 × 106 cells) was collected after variable periods of time, as indicated, for analysis of released AChE activity. The extracts and culture media were stored at −80 °C. Extracts from snake liver were found to hydrolyze butyrylthiocholine, as well as acetylthiocholine, indicating the presence of both AChE and BChE. As shown in Fig. 1, an AChE component sedimented at 4.5 S (about 80% of the total cholinesterase activity), and a BChE component sedimented at 10.9 S (about 20% of the total activity); only the latter component hydrolyzed butyrylthiocholine (not shown). The sedimentation patterns were not modified by incubation with PI-PLC (not shown) and were identical in the presence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 1), in the presence of Brij-96, or without detergent (not shown), indicating that both components were nonamphiphilic, corresponding to a monomeric form of AChE (G1na) and a tetrameric form of BChE (G4na). The residual activity observed around 11 S in the presence of iso-OMPA, a specific inhibitor of BChE, and the fact that BW284C51, a specific inhibitor of AChE, reduced the cholinesterase activity of the same fractions suggests the presence of a small contribution of tetrameric AChE (G4na). The absence of amphiphilic forms and the fact that PI-PLC had no effect on these profiles indicated that the snake liver did not produce any GPI-anchored form of AChE. Fig. 2 shows that detergent-soluble extracts from Bungarus muscles contained a much smaller proportion of BChE, representing less than 2% of the total cholinesterase activity. The sedimentation patterns, obtained in the presence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 2 A) or of Brij-96 (Fig. 2 B), showed three AChE components (a major one, corresponding to amphiphilic tetramers (G4a) sedimenting at 9.5 S in Brij-96 and 10.9 S in Triton X-100, and two minor ones, corresponding to amphiphilic monomers (G1a) sedimenting at 3.5 S in Brij-96 and 4.5 S in Triton X-100) and nonamphiphilic AChE monomers (G1na) sedimenting at 4.5 S in both conditions. The same muscle extract contained a small proportion of BChE, corresponding to amphiphilic tetramers (G4a) sedimenting at 9.8 S in Brij-96 and 11 S in Triton X-100. The AChE and BChE G4a peaks presented a small but definite difference in their sedimentation when assayed in the same gradient fractions, showing that they really correspond to distinct molecules. There was no indication of the presence of a dimeric AChE form, and treatment with PI-PLC did not modify the sedimentation profiles. To examine whether snake muscles also contained collagen-tailed AChE forms, which aggregate at low ionic strength, the pellet obtained after two successive extractions in the low salt detergent buffer was re-extracted in a high salt detergent buffer. The AChE activity that was solubilized under these conditions was analyzed by sedimentation in a gradient containing 0.4 m NaCl and 0.2% Triton X-100, with or without prior digestion by collagenase. Fig. 3 shows that in addition to major G1a and G4a components, the high salt extract contained a small proportion of asymmetric A8 and A12 forms, which were modified by collagenase in a characteristic manner: their sedimentation coefficients were increased from 13.4 to 15.1 S and from 17.3 to 18.5 S, respectively. Taken together, these two molecular forms represent less than 3‰ of the total AChE activity in the muscle extracts. The presence of G1a, G4a, A8, and A12 forms clearly demonstrates that AChET subunits are expressed in Bungarus muscles. The absence of GPI-anchored dimers indicate that AChEH subunits are not produced inBungarus liver or muscles. Therefore, it appears that only AChET and AChES are produced in these tissues. To confirm this, we analyzed the structure of AChE transcripts and of the AChE gene. A Southern blot of digestedBungarus genomic DNA was hybridized with a probe corresponding to nucleotides 1610–1727 of the AChE cDNA from venom glands, within the coding region of the catalytic domain. We obtained a single labeled band after digestion by EcoRI and BamHI, suggesting that Bungarus possesses a single gene for AChE (not shown). Experiments involving 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends were unsuccessful to identify the 3′ region of the coding sequence of AChE cDNA in muscle. To obtain the complete coding sequence, we amplified a cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal region of muscle AChE, by reverse transcription-PCR. Reverse transcription of mRNA was performed with random hexanucleotides associated with Ri and Ro sequences for PCR priming (20Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4333) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). PCR was then performed with Ri and Ro reverse primers and a forward primer corresponding to a fragment from the AChE cDNA previously cloned from venom gland (7Cousin X. Bon S. Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15099-15108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We thus amplified a fragment of about 200 bp, which was subcloned and sequenced (Fig. 4 B). According to this sequence, the end of the catalytic domain is identical to that of the venom cDNA clone, but it is associated with a different C-terminal region. In agreement with our analysis of AChE forms in muscles, this region corresponds to a T-peptide, as shown by its alignment with sequences fromCaenorhabditis, Torpedo, avian, and mammalian AChEs (Fig. 4 C). The strict conservation of eight aromatic residues and of a cysteine residue at position −4 of the C terminus is particularly noticeable. Thus, the AChE gene that produces the venom enzyme also generates T transcripts in muscles. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments showed that both S and T transcripts exist in venom glands, liver, and muscle (not shown). RNase protection assays indicated that the venom glands contain mostly S transcripts, with only a small fraction (<5%) T transcripts, whereas the other tissues contain approximately two-thirds S transcripts and one-third T transcripts (Fig. 5). We explored the structure of the Bungarus AChE gene by PCR amplification of genomic DNA, using primers corresponding to various exonic sequences. The results are shown in Fig. 6. The sequence encoding the catalytic domain is interrupted by an intron (about 1.3 kb) at the level of amino acid 475 (according to the Torpedo numbering), as in other vertebrates. The last common exon (encoding 35 residues) is followed by a genomic region of 1741 base pairs, preceding the T exon. The region encoding the C-terminal part of the venom AChE (SARA, or S) is located about 300 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon of the T exon. Therefore, the SARA region does not derive from a readthrough sequence but from a novel type of exon, which we call S (Fig. 7). It is interesting to note that the 300-nucleotide-long sequence located between the sequence encoding the T-peptide and exon S contains GC-rich domains. In Torpedo and mammalian AChE genes, the H exon is located between the last common catalytic exon and exon T (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.M. Prog. Neurosci. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). The 1741 bp-long corresponding region in Bungarus AChE gene was fully sequenced: its analysis did not reveal the presence of any H-like open reading frame that might encode a GPI-addition C-terminal signal peptide (33Ferguson M.A.J. Williams A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 285-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Bungarus AChE gene does not appear to contain an H exon. We transfected COS cells with expression vectors containing either the cDNA sequence encoding the AChETsubunit or a partial genomic construct (AChEgT), which included the 1741-bp intron preceding exon T, where a putative H exon would be expected to be localized (see Fig. 7). The total AChE activity and the proportion that was secreted in the culture medium were the same in both cases: 30–45% of the activity was recovered in the medium, 2 days after transfection. As illustrated in the case of the AChET construct (Fig. 8,A and B), sedimentation analysis showed that the cells and the culture medium contained G1a, G2a and G4na forms, as well as heavy polydisperse aggregates. These aggregates, which have not been observed in other AChE species, accounted for as much as 80% of the total activity in cell extracts. The culture medium contained the same type of molecules, including aggregates, with a higher proportion of G2a than in the cells. We obtained the same results with the AChEgT construct (not shown). We could not detect any PI-PLC-sensitive AChE, showing that only AChETsubunits were produced. This demonstrates the absence of any functional exon H, that would generate AChEH subunits. In co-transfection with the binding protein QN/HC (31Bon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3007-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Duval N. Krejci E. Grassi J. Coussen F. Massoulié J. Bon S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3255-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the proportion of monomers, dimers, and aggregates was markedly decreased; AChETsubunits were largely assembled into GPI-anchored tetramers characterized by their sensitivity to PI-PLC, both in the case of the cDNA (Fig. 8, C and D) and in the case of the AChEgT construct (not shown). These results were confirmed by electrophoretic analyses in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 9). The GPI-anchored G4a form was converted by PI-PLC to a hydrophilic derivative, which migrated faster in nondenaturing electrophoresis (Fig. 9). The production of such heteromeric molecules is a further confirmation that Bungarus AChETsubunits can form the same types of quaternary associations as those of other species. When we varied the quantity of vector DNA used for transfection, the production of secreted AChE activity increased at low doses, and re"

Although information on α1-proteinase inhibitor gene structure has been obtained, little is known regarding the cis- and trans-acting factors that regulate its expression. In this study, we cloned and sequenced a 2.7-kilobase 5′-flanking region upstream from the corneal transcription initiation site of the gene, demonstrated functional promoter activity, and identified the regulatory elements. Sequencing revealed that the 5′-flanking element was highly G/C-rich in regions proximal to the corneal transcription start site. DNase I footprinting located 10 potential Sp1-binding sites between nucleotides −1519 and +44. The putative promoter was functional in human corneal stromal cells, but not in human skin, scleral, and conjunctival fibroblasts, suggesting that the promoter may be corneal cell-specific. The promoter activity in the corneal cells was repressed when Sp1 was coexpressed. In the cornea-thinning disease keratoconus, down-regulation of the α1-proteinase inhibitor gene and increased Sp1 expression have both been demonstrated. The current results suggest that down-regulation of the inhibitor in keratoconus corneas may be related directly to overexpression of the Sp1 gene.

Proteinase inhibitors are critical in preventing and controlling proteolysis.

Jeppsson J.O. Putnam F.W. The Plasma Proteins. 1. Academic Press, New York1975: 229-264Google Scholar). One of its primary physiologic roles is to protect the elastic fibers in lung alveoli from excessive digestion by neutrophil elastase (2Olsen G.N. Harris J.O. Castle J.R. Waldman R.H. Karmgard H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 55: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Gadek J.E. Hunninghake G.W. Fells G.A. Zimmerman R.L. Keogh B.A. Crystal R.G. Bull. Eur. Physiopathol. Respir. 1980; 16: 27-40PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of this protein was proposed in the 1960s based on observations that genetically α1-PI-deficient patients developed an early-onset degenerative lung disease (4Eriksson S. Acta Med. Scand. 1964; 175: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) or a liver disease (5Sharp H.L. Bridges R.A. Krivit W. Freier E.R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1969; 73: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar). The liver is the predominant site of α1-PI synthesis (1Laurell C.B. Jeppsson J.O. Putnam F.W. The Plasma Proteins. 1. Academic Press, New York1975: 229-264Google Scholar). This protein is also found synthesized in blood monocytes and macrophages (6Perlmutter D.H. Cole F.S. Kilbridge P. Rossing T.H. Colten H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), alveolar macrophages (7White R. Lee D. Habicht G.S. Janoff A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1981; 123: 447-449PubMed Google Scholar), intestinal epithelial cells (8Perlmutter D.H. Daniels J.D. Auerbach H.S. De Schryver-Kecskemeti K. Winter H.S. Alpers D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9485-9490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and human breast carcinoma (9Tokes Z.A. Gendler S.J. Dermer G.B. J. Supramol. Struct. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 17: 69-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the synthesis of α1-PI by human corneal cells has been reported (10Twining S.S. Fukuchi T. Yue B.Y. Wilson P.M. Boškovic G. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 458-462PubMed Google Scholar). The cornea, located in the anterior portion of the eye, is a transparent connective tissue made up of epithelial, stromal, and endothelial layers. The balance between proteinases and proteinase inhibitors is believed to play a significant role in maintaining normal cellular contents and normal function of the cornea (10Twining S.S. Fukuchi T. Yue B.Y. Wilson P.M. Boškovic G. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 458-462PubMed Google Scholar). A proper level of α1-PI may protect the cornea from degradation by neutrophil elastase during inflammation. Additionally, α1-PI may function as a backup inhibitor for other serine proteinases such as plasmin and cathepsin G in the cornea. In an ocular disease called keratoconus, α1-PI expression is reduced to one-third to one-fifth of the normal level, and the expression of degradative enzymes is increased (11Sawaguchi S. Twining S.S. Yue B.Y.J.T Wilson P.M. Sugar J. Chan S. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Whitelock R.B. Fukuchi T. Zhou L. Twining S.S. Sugar J. Feder R.S. Yue B.Y.J.T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1997; 38: 529-534PubMed Google Scholar). This disease is a noninflammatory disorder that progressively thins and distorts the central portion of the cornea and leads to visual impairment (13Krachmer J.H. Feder R.S. Belin M.W. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1984; 28: 293-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). The etiology is unclear, although one hypothesis is that the abnormality in keratoconus may lie in the degradative pathway of macromolecular constituents in the cornea (14Yue B.Y.J.T. Sugar J. Benveniste K. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1985; 175: 336-341Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A reduction in the α1-PI level certainly would have a direct impact on the degradation processes, contributing to keratoconus conditions. The α1-PI gene has been localized on chromosome 14. It contains seven exons: Ia, Ib, Ic, and II–V (15Brantly M. Nukiawa T. Crystal R.G. Am. J. Med. 1988; 84: 13-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α1-PI transcripts that comprise different numbers of exons have been identified. The α1-PI mRNA from the liver and intestinal epithelium contains five exons (Ic and II–V), with a single transcription start site in the middle of exon Ic (16Hafeez W. Ciliberto G. Perlmutter D.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The major promoter elements for this transcript are found in exon Ic and in the intron between exons Ib and Ic. In blood monocytes, multiple transcripts exist; all seven exons can be expressed, or exons Ib and Ic can be spliced out (17Perlino E. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 2G. Boškovic and S. S. Twining, submitted for publication. 2G. Boškovic and S. S. Twining, submitted for publication. In addition, three transcription initiation sites (Fig. 1) were noted: two in exon Ia and the third in exon Ib (16Hafeez W. Ciliberto G. Perlmutter D.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The promoter region upstream from exon Ia has not previously been studied. In the cornea, alternatively spliced forms have been found by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One of these forms is similar in size to that found in monocytes that has exons Ib and Ic spliced out,2 and the other involves an alternative splicing between exons Ib and Ic. The transcription initiation site for the cornea-specific form (Fig. 1) is ∼2 kb upstream from the hepatocyte site between the two macrophage sites in exon Ia.2 The translation start site, ∼7.4 kb downstream from the corneal transcription initiation site (18Long G.L. Chandra T. Woo S.L.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4828-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), is the same for hepatocytes, monocytes, and the cornea. The use of different transcription start sites for the α1-PI gene and the alternative splicing in different cells suggest that the gene transcription may respond to cell-specific regulatory mechanisms (17Perlino E. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Long G.L. Chandra T. Woo S.L.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2759-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although liver-specific α1-PI gene regulation has been intensively studied (19Ciliberto G. Dente L. Cortese R. Cell. 1985; 41: 531-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20DeSimone V. Ciliberto G. Hardon E. Paonessa G. Palla F. Lundberg L. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2759-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), there is relatively little information regarding the cis- and trans-acting factors directing α1-PI gene expression in extrahepatocytic cell types. In this study, a 2.7-kb 5′-flanking DNA upstream from the corneal transcription initiation site of the α1-PI gene was sequenced; its functional activity in corneal cells was demonstrated; and the regulatory elements of this putative promoter were investigated. Emphasis was placed on the binding sites for transcription factor Sp1 and gene regulation by Sp1 because the Sp1 level has been found to be increased 10–15-fold in keratoconus corneas (21Whitelock R.B. Li Y. Zhou L. Sugar J. Yue B.Y.J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the 5′-flanking element identified may be cornea-specific, that Sp1 appears to be involved in regulation of the promoter activity, and that the down-regulation of the α1-PI gene observed in keratoconus corneas may be directly related to the overexpression of Sp1. This information may help elucidate the molecular pathways leading to the altered α1-PI expression in keratoconus. Corneal stromal cells were cultured from normal human corneas obtained from the Illinois Eye Bank. The corneal cells, skin fibroblasts derived from skin tissues, and scleral and conjunctival fibroblasts derived from donor eyes were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, nonessential and essential amino acids, and antibiotics as described previously (22Yue B.Y.J.T. Baum J.L. Vision Res. 1981; 21: 41-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For PromoterFinder experiments, a pair of sense strand PCR primers, gene-specific for α1-PI (Gsp1 and Gsp2), were selected through the computer program Oligo Version 4.1 (National Biosciences, Plymouth, MN) from the known human exon Ia genomic DNA sequence of α1-PI (17Perlino E. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Ciliberto G. Dente L. Cortese R. Cell. 1985; 41: 531-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and were used to amplify the upstream region. Primer sequences were as follows: Gsp1, GTAGACTTCGGGTGGAGGCAGT; and Gsp2, GGGGAGCTTGGACAGGAAG. Primers were synthesized by Genemed Biotechnologies, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). The PromoterFinder DNA Walking kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used to amplify the upstream region. This kit provides five human genomic libraries, each exhaustively digested with one of five restriction enzymes and manipulated to have specific known sequences attached to either end of all digested fragments. A pair of primers specific for these attached sequences (Ap1 and Ap2) were used in conjunction with the α1-PI gene-specific primers (Gsp1 and Gsp2) in five long PCRs (one for each library) using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim). The primary round of PCR was carried out with the outer primers (Ap1 and Gsp1) with seven cycles at 94 °C for 2 s and 72 °C for 3 min, 32 cycles at 94 °C for 2 s and 67 °C for 3 min, and 1 cycle at 67 °C for 4 min using the GeneAmp 2400 Cycler (Perkin-Elmer). One microliter of a 1:50 dilution of the primary PCRs was subjected to a second nested long PCR using the inner primers (Ap2 and Gsp2) with five cycles at 94 °C for 2 s and 72 °C for 3 min, 20 cycles at 94 °C for 2 s and 67 °C for 3 min, and 1 cycle at 67 °C for 4 min. The PCR products were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). DNA sequencing was performed using the Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer). The sequences were analyzed by the MacVector computer program. A 2712-bp (−2703 to +9) α1-PI 5′-flanking region obtained from a long PCR was ligated into the multiple cloning sites of the pSEAP2-Basic vector. This plasmid was digested with restriction enzymes and separated on a 1% agarose gel. Southern blotting was performed according to the Boehringer-Mannheim nonradioactive detection protocol using Hybond N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The two DNA probes (probes 1 and 2) were selected and prepared by PCRs using genomic DNA as the template. The DNA sequence of probe 1 (−2695 to −1977) was according to the sequence we identified, and that of probe 2 (−172 to +44) was from the sequence published in the literature (17Perlino E. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Probes 1 and 2 were randomly labeled using a nonradioactive labeling kit. Restriction digestions using endonucleasesApaI, SmaI, and PstI were performed to further prove the identity of the α1-PI 5′-flanking sequence we identified. Four DNA fragments covering 1563 bp (−1519 to +44) of the α1-PI promoter region were prepared from genomic DNA by PCR (fragment 1, −338 to +44; fragment 2, −782 to −321; fragment 3, −1200 to −731; and fragment 4, −1519 to −1115). They were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Footprinting was performed using the labeled DNA fragments (30 ng) and human Sp1 transcription factor from Promega (4 or 2 footprinting units) according to the Promega core footprinting protocol. In the competitive footprinting assay, 50- and 100-fold molar excesses of unlabeled Sp1 oligonucleotide competitors (Promega) were included in the reaction mixture. Purine sequence ladders of DNA probes were prepared (23Maxam A.M. Gibert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar) and subjected to gel electrophoresis on urea sequencing gels adjacent to footprint reactions of the same probe to localize binding site sequences. The series of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) vectors available from CLONTECHwere used for promoter-reporter plasmid constructs. A 2712-bp (−2703 to +9) α1-PI promoter fragment and a 1406-bp (−1397 to +9) fragment obtained from a long PCR were ligated into the KpnI and BglII multiple cloning sites of the pSEAP2-Basic vector, yielding the p2.7SEAP+ and p1.4SEAP+ vectors. The plasmids p2.7SEAP+, p1.4SEAP+, pSEAP2-Basic, and pSEAP2-Control (positive control, driven by the SV40 early promoter) and pSV-βgal (Promega) used in cell transfections were purified by QIAGEN ion-exchange columns and were partially sequenced or restriction-digested to confirm their identity and orientation. Human corneal stromal cells and skin, scleral, and conjunctival fibroblasts were plated at 0.9 × 106 cells/well on six-well plates 24 h before DNA transfection. Three hours before transfection, the dishes received fresh medium. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method using the CalPhos Maximizer transfection kit fromCLONTECH. In brief, 20 μg of the test plasmid (p2.7SEAP+, p1.4SEAP+, pSEAP2-Basic, or pSEAP2-Control) along with 2 μg of pSV-βgal vector, used to control transfection efficiency, were mixed with 40 μl of CalPhos Maximizer as recommended by the manufacturer. Some cells also received 2 or 4 μg of Sp1 expression vector pPacSp1. None of the test plasmids were added to cells serving as negative controls. After incubation with the DNA mixture for 4 h, fresh culture medium was added to the cells, and the medium was collected 72 h later for SEAP assay. Cells that received no DNA were used as negative controls. For SEAP activity, 15 μl of cell medium was mixed with 45 μl of 1× dilution buffer and 60 μl of assay buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH). For the enzyme activity, the absorbance was read for 1 s on a Luminometer (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). For β-galactosidase assays, cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 150 μl of 0.25m Tris (pH 8.0), lysed by freezing and thawing, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The extract was mixed with Galacto-Lysis solution (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Ten microliters of lysate were used for the Bradford protein assay (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase activity was used to normalize the SEAP enzyme activity. Assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Two-tailed Student's t tests were used to analyze the significance of the data. The corneal 5′-flanking region of the human α1-PI gene was isolated using the PromoterFinder kit (Fig. 2). Three products (2.6, 2.0, and 0.8 kb) were obtained from the EcoRV library. Two PCR fragments (0.6 and 0.28 kb) were obtained from the ScaI and PvuII libraries, respectively. From the SspI library, three PCR fragments (1.3, 1.0, and 0.7 kb) resulted. No product was observed in the DraI library. All the PCR products were ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector for sequencing. A total of 2725 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region from the corneal transcription initiation site was sequenced (Fig. 3). The cytidine of CAG (corneal transcription start site) was designated as position +1. The sequence underlined in Fig. 3 shared the same 390-bp sequence published by Perlino et al. (17Perlino E. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). An equal distribution of G + C (51%) and A + T pairs (49%) was found in the entire 2725-bp sequence. However, high G + C content (61%) was noted in sequence −522 to +157 proximal to the corneal transcription initiation site. No consensus TATA box was present, but a TATA-like sequence (TCTA) was located at position −59. Eight potential binding sites for transcription factor Sp1 (boxed in Fig. 3), 57 for AP-1, 31 for NF-κB, 59 for the insulin response element, and numerous potential binding sites for other transcription factors were identified in the promoter sequence by the MacVector computer program. For Southern blot analyses (Fig. 4 A), probes 1 and 2 were made from genomic DNA according to the 5′-flanking sequence we identified and the known exon sequence (17Perlino E. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Ciliberto G. Dente L. Cortese R. Cell. 1985; 41: 531-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), respectively. Both probes recognized a 2.7-kb band, confirming that the DNA sequence we identified was indeed a portion of the α1-PI gene sequence. This was further proved by restriction digestion of the p2.7SEAP+ plasmid. The recognition sites forApaI are nucleotides −1408, −886, and −145; forSmaI, nucleotides −661 and −211; and for PstI, nucleotides −1715, −955, and −346 (Fig. 4 B). One of the ApaI sites (nucleotide −145) and one of the SmaI sites (nucleotide −211) have been reported previously in the literature (17Perlino E. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The sizes of bands resulting from enzyme digestions (Fig. 4 C) matched those expected from the restriction map deduced from the identified sequence. Sp1 binding to the 5′-flanking element of the α1-PI gene was further examined by DNase I footprint analysis. Ten regions in the 1563-bp (−1519 to +44) portion of the 5′-flanking DNA were found to be protected by Sp1 against DNase I digestion (Fig. 5, A–D); regions 1–10 covered from nucleotides −100 to −87; −301 to −290, −409 to −403, −519 to −498, −593 to −579, −622 to −612, −672 to −666, −819 to −793, −932 to −915, and −998 to −987, respectively. The 10 binding sites are marked by asterisks in the sequence shown in Fig. 3. Five of the regions (boxed and marked byasterisks) correlated with the Sp1-binding sites identified by MacVector. The remaining five (marked by asterisks) were G/C-rich regions. The Sp1 binding was specific because the degree of DNase I protection was reduced in the presence of a competing Sp1 oligonucleotide. The activity of this putative α1-PI gene promoter in normal human corneal stromal cells and in skin, scleral, and conjunctival fibroblasts was investigated in transient transfection assays. For corneal stromal cells, DNA fragments containing 1406 bp (p1.4SEAP+) and 2712 bp (p2.7SEAP+) of the 5′-flanking sequence were approximately six times more active at driving SEAP reporter gene expression than the pSEAP2-Basic vector (Fig. 6). No such activity was found, indicating that neither segment of the 5′-flanking DNA was functional in skin, scleral, and conjunctival fibroblasts. When corneal stromal cells were cotransfected with pPacSp1, the level of SEAP expression was markedly reduced (Fig. 7).Figure 7Relative SEAP enzyme activities in normal human corneal stromal cells transfected with the pSEAP2-Basic, p1.4SEAP+, or p2.7SEAP+ vector along with pSV-βgal in the absence or presence of Sp1 expression vector pPacSp1. Asterisks denote data significantly different from those obtained from cells without Sp1 coexpression. Note that cotransfection with pPacSp1 reduces SEAP expression. The promoter activities derived from the p1.4SEAP+ and p2.7SEAP+ vectors are not significantly different. The β-galactosidase activity was used to normalize the SEAP activity. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. (n = 3). Two-tailed Student's t tests were used to analyze the significance of the data. Experiments were repeated at least three times, and all yielded similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) This study provides the first comprehensive structural and functional analysis of the 5′-flanking element of the human α1-PI gene upstream from the corneal transcription start site. The 2.7-kb region sequenced is characterized by multiple binding sites for transcription factor Sp1 and the absence of a consensus TATA box. Transient transfection experiments showed that the 2.7-kb 5′-flanking DNA is functional in human corneal stromal cells and that the proximal 1400 base pairs are sufficient for full promoter activity. No promoter activity was found for either the 2.7- or 1.4-kb segment in human skin, scleral, and conjunctival fibroblasts, suggesting that the 5′-flanking element we identified may be specific for corneal cells. Consistent with this notion, the cornea-specific alternatively spliced form of α1-PI was not found in the skin dermis or the sclera, although the form similar to that identified in monocytes was expressed (data not shown). Multiple start sites of transcription by primer extension have been found in the human α1-PI gene (25Wang L.-H Hajibeigi A. Xu X.-M. Loose-Mitchell D. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The α1-PI gene appears to belong to a class of eukaryotic genes (namely, housekeeping genes) that are constitutively expressed at a basal level. The promoters of these genes are characterized by a high G/C content, by multiple binding sites for Sp1, by the absence of a consensus TATA box, and by the feature that they initiate transcription from multiple sites spread over a fairly large region (26Kageyama R. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15508-15514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that alternative promoters are used for different α1-PI transcripts in hepatocytes and macrophages (17Perlino E. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27Kelsey G.D. Povery S. Bygrave A.E. Lovell-Badge R.H. Genes Dev. 1987; 3: 16-25Google Scholar). For hepatocytes, the minimal promoter element required for liver-specific basal expression of human α1-PI is confined within 261 nucleotides from the transcription start site (19Ciliberto G. Dente L. Cortese R. Cell. 1985; 41: 531-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20DeSimone V. Ciliberto G. Hardon E. Paonessa G. Palla F. Lundberg L. Cortese R.

Science. 1988; 242: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) have been noted within this segment, and the first two factors were found to be essential for liver-specific expression of α1-PI (20DeSimone V. Ciliberto G. Hardon E. Paonessa G. Palla F. Lundberg L. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2759-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34Hardon E.M. Frain M. Paonessa G. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1711-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). LF-A1 and LF-B1 also bind to a series of other liver-specific genes, positively regulating their expression in the liver (20DeSimone V. Ciliberto G. Hardon E. Paonessa G. Palla F. Lundberg L. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2759-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 35Ramji D.P. Tadros M.H. Hardon E.M. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the corneal α1-PI 5′-flanking element using the MacVector computer program and/or DNase footprinting experiments demonstrated numerous binding sites for transcription factors, including Sp1, AP-1, and NF-κB, but no LF-A1 or LF-B1 sites were identified. Also, no homology was found between the liver and the putative corneal promoters. This suggests that the specificity and efficiency of gene transcription may depend on cell-specific transcription factors. Complex interactions with other factors may also be involved. The regulation of α1-PI expression in the cornea has not been previously investigated. The current results show that the α1-PI promoter activity in corneal cells was repressed by overexpression of Sp1. This indicates that the Sp1 sites are involved in the regulation of the α1-PI gene. In this regard, it is of interest to note that in keratoconus corneas, in which gene expression of α1-PI is reduced, Sp1 expression is found increased in both epithelial and stromal layers. Sp1 binding activity has also been shown to be markedly enhanced in nuclear extracts from the epithelium of keratoconus corneas. The expression of four other transcription factors studied, AP-1, AP-2, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, and NF-κB, remains unaltered (21Whitelock R.B. Li Y. Zhou L. Sugar J. Yue B.Y.J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Sp1 abnormality is also cornea-specific and is not found in either the conjunctiva or the skin. 3L. Zhou, I. Maruyama, Y. Li, J. Sugar, and B. Y. J. T. Yue, unpublished results. Sp1 is a specific factor originally described as required for SV40 transcription. It interacts with GC boxes in the promoter elements and plays an important role in the expression of many viral and cellular genes (36Dynan W.S. Saffer J.D. Lee W.S. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4915-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 32: 669-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 38Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Recent investigations have shown that the activity and synthesis of Sp1 are subject to a variety of regulations. For example, Sp1 expression is increased during SV40 infection of CV1 cells (39Saffer J.D. Jackson S.J. Thurston S.J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although ubiquitously expressed, the level of Sp1 protein expression varies widely among different cell types in the mouse, and increased Sp1 expression has been associated with late stages of differentiation (38Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of Sp1 expression have also been noted in gastric carcinoma cells (40Kitadai Y. Yasui W. Yokozaki H. Kuniyasu H. Haruma K. Tahara E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1342-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but keratoconus is the only human disease known to exhibit altered Sp1 expression. Our demonstration that the α1-PI promoter activity is suppressed by expression of Sp1 in corneal cells suggests that Sp1 may play a significant role in the regulation of the α1-PI gene in the cornea during development, normal homeostasis, or under pathologic conditions. In the cornea-thinning disease keratoconus, the reduction of the α1-PI level may be directly related to increased Sp1 expression. We thank Dr. Robert Tjian for providing plasmid pPacSp1, R. Brent Whitelock for performing pilot experiments, Drs. John Varga and Shu-Jen Chen for invaluable suggestions during the course of this study, and Dr. Theodore Perl for supplying keratoconus tissues."

To explore the role of Src family kinases in hematopoietic cell adhesion, we overexpressed Chk in the megakaryocytic cell line Dami and established clones exhibiting a 10-fold increase in the amount of Chk. Overexpression of Chk was found to suppress VLA5 integrin-mediated cell spreading, but not cell attachment, throughout fibronectin (FN) stimulation. Deletion and point mutagenesis analyses of Chk showed that this suppression was dependent upon both the SH3 domain, which is responsible for membrane anchoring, and kinase activity. FN-induced cell spreading accompanied a sustained increase in Lyn activity with coincidental kinetics and the activation of Lyn was also suppressed by overexpression of Chk but not a Chk mutant lacking the SH3 domain. Expression of a truncated Lyn mutant lacking the kinase domain inhibited both cell spreading and Lyn activation upon stimulation with FN. These results suggest that sustained activation of Lyn, which is regulated by membrane-anchored Chk, plays a crucial role in VLA5-mediated cell spreading but not cell attachment to a FN substrate.

Src family protein-tyrosine kinases play crucial roles in regulating proliferation and differentiation of multiple cell types, including hematopoietic cells (1Bolen J.B. Rowley R.B. Spana C.

Like Csk, Chk has Src homology 3 (SH3) and SH2 domains and lacks the consensus tyrosine phosphorylation and myristoylation sites found in Src family kinases. Chk has been shown to phosphorylate the C-terminal negative regulatory tyrosine residue of Src family kinases (e.g. Lck, Fyn, c-Src, and Lyn) in vitro or in a yeast co-expression system, suggesting that Chk may share functional properties with Csk (13Klages S.

However, Csk is ubiquitously expressed, whereas Chk expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells and neuronal cells in the brain. The expression of both Chk and Csk in these cell types implies either functional redundancy or specific roles for both kinases. Recent studies indicate that Chk and Csk might differentially regulate the functions of Src family kinases (18Chow L.M.L. Davidson D. Fournel M. Gosselin P. Lemieux S. Lyu M.S. Kozak C.A. Matis L.A.

In platelets, Chk is shown to negatively regulate Lyn but not c-Src due to the unique membrane localization of Chk, suggesting that co-expression of Chk and Csk confers specific roles for both kinases in platelet activation (20Hirao A. Hamaguchi I. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, e.g.fibronectin (FN), vitronectin, collagens, and laminin, is critical in cell growth, differentiation, and migration (25Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5856) Google Scholar, 26Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar, 27Hynes R.O.

Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2821) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that c-Src is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion. Previous studies withsrc −/− fibroblasts have indicated that the lack of c-Src results in a reduced rate of cell spreading on FN, although the spreading can be completed, and that expression of the SH3-SH2 domain of c-Src enhances the rate of cell spreading, suggesting that c-Src can affect cell adhesion of fibroblasts by a kinase-independent mechanism (29Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In addition, Csk-overexpressing HeLa cells are reported to become spherical in cell morphology with reorganization of the vitronectin receptor (αvβ5 integrin), suggesting a role of Csk in the regulation of integrins in HeLa cells (30Bergman M. Joukov V. Virtanen I. Alitalo K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 711-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the involvement of Src family kinases in hematopoietic cell adhesion is still unclear. In this study, we explored the role of Src family kinases in hematopoietic cell adhesion by means of both overexpression of Chk and expression of a truncated Lyn mutant lacking the kinase domain in the human megakaryocytic cell line Dami. We found that a sustained increase in Lyn kinase activity, which is regulated by membrane-anchored Chk, is required for VLA5-mediated cell spreading on a FN substrate, suggesting that activation of Lyn plays an important role in cell adhesion mediated by VLA5. The FLAG epitope-tagged Chk (Chk-FLAG) was constructed previously (20Hirao A. Hamaguchi I. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Chk-FLAG mutants, Chk-ΔN, Chk-ΔSH3, or Chk-ΔSH2, with respective deletions in the unique N-terminal (amino acid residues 1–41), SH3 (amino acid residues 49–110), or SH2 (amino acid residues 118–196) domain, were generated by polymerase chain reaction with the SRα promoter-driven pMKITneo vector containing human Chk-FLAG as a template. Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed with appropriate restriction sites to facilitate subsequent cloning. The resulting DNA fragments were all confirmed by DNA sequencing. The lysine to arginine mutation at position 262 in the ATP binding site of the kinase domain of Chk-FLAG was constructed previously (20Hirao A. Hamaguchi I. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Dami cells (31Greenberg S.M. Rosenthal D.S. Greeley T.A. Tantravahi R. Handin R.I. Blood. 1988; 72: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection and grown in suspension in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum. Dami cells were transfected with the pMKITneo vector (kindly provided by Drs. K. Maruyama and T. Yamamoto) or the pMKITneo vector containing human Chk-FLAG or each Chk mutant, and stably transfected cell clones were selected in 400 μg/ml G418. To generate Lyn lacking the kinase domain (LynΔK), the SRα promoter-driven pME18S vector encoding human p56 Lyn (kindly provided by Drs. H. Nishizumi and T. Yamamoto) (32Yamanashi Y. Fukushige S. Semba K. Sukegawa J. Miyajima N. Matsubara K. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was digested with PstI and religated after removing the insert, resulting in the vector encoding LynΔK (amino acid residues 1–298). Dami cells were cotransfected with the pME18S or the pME18S-LynΔK vector, together with the pMiwhph vector (kindly provided by Dr. S. Nada) conferring hygromycin resistance, and stably transfected cells were selected in 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Plates were coated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 μg/ml fibronectin (FN) or 1% bovine serum albumin for 4 h at room temperature and washed with PBS. Cells were preequilibrated in serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium for 4 h at 37 °C in bovine serum albumin-coated plates that prevent nonspecific adhesion. After washing, cells were resuspended in serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, seeded on FN-coated plates, and incubated at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed with gentle washing, and the adherent cells were observed under a phase contrast microscope. Cell spreading on FN-coated plates was quantitated by counting the number of cells showing decreased cell refractility and formation of projections around the cell periphery. For blocking, cells were reacted with an antibody against VLA4 (SG/73; Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo) (33Miyake K. Hasunuma Y. Yagita H. Kimoto M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), VLA5 (IIA1; Pharmingen) (34Tran Van Nhieu G. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1887-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), or a control antibody (MOPC21; Sigma) at 20 μg/ml before spreading assays. Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label, ICN) as described previously (35Fukuda M.N. Sato T. Nakayama J. Klier G. Mikami M. Aoki D. Nozawa S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The 35S-labeled cells were washed with PBS and then incubated on FN-coated plates at 37 °C for the indicated times. After nonadherent cells were collected, adherent cells were recovered by scraping, followed by solubilization with 2% SDS, and radioactivity was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. Cells were seeded on FN-coated coverslips as above and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, followed by immunostaining, using an anti-vinculin antibody (hVIN-1; Sigma), as described previously (36Yamaguchi N. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12170-12176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For FACS analysis, without fixation and permeabilization cells were stained with anti-VLA4 or anti-VLA5 antibody or a control antibody, washed, and stained with secondary reagents. Viable cells were analyzed with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmKH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm leupeptin, 25 μmpepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)), followed by sonication (four pulses for 10 s), and addition of an equal volume of adjusting buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 290 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitors). After removing unbroken cells, cell debris, and nuclei by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 2 min, the supernatants were separated into soluble (S100) and particulate (P100) fractions by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were stimulated with FN as described above, except that 1 mmNa3VO4 was included in adhesion medium during the last 60 min of preequilibration and subsequent stimulation periods. After removing nonadherent cells, cell lysates were prepared at 4 °C in Triton lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). Immunoprecipitations were performed with an anti-Lyn (Lyn44; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody, as described elsewhere (20Hirao A. Hamaguchi I. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207461) Google Scholar) and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Immunodetection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) using antibodies against the FLAG epitope (M2; Eastman Kodak Co.), Chk (13G2) (20Hirao A. Hamaguchi I. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), Csk (Csk(C-20); Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Src (327; Oncogene Science), Lyn (Lyn9; Wako Chemical Co., Osaka), and phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in conjunction with horseradish peroxidase-coupled F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-Ig (Amersham Corp.). The presence of Na3VO4 in the adhesion medium had no effect on either FN-induced cell spreading or on the kinase activity of Lyn, while FN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins could be detected only in the presence of Na3VO4 (data not shown). After washing immune complexes with radioimmune precipitation buffer supplemented with 2 mmNa3VO4 and with Triton lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, an aliquot of Lyn immunoprecipitate was subjected to an in vitro kinase assay with 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and an equal aliquot was applied to a quantitative immunoblot, as described previously (20Hirao A. Hamaguchi I. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Lyn immunoprecipitates were incubated with acid-denatured enolase in a kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMnCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100). After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the reaction was terminated by addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. The samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. The gels were treated with 1 n KOH at 56 °C for 2 h and subjected to a BAS 2000 BioImage Analyzer (FUJIX, Tokyo). To investigate the role of Src family kinases in hematopoietic cell adhesion, Chk was overexpressed in the human megakaryocytic cell line Dami. Transfected cell lines immunoblotted with an anti-Chk antibody showed that the expression levels of the FLAG-tagged Chk (see Fig. 3 A; Chk-FLAG) (20Hirao A. Hamaguchi I. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were about 10-fold higher than those of endogenous Chk (Fig. 1 A). At least two independent sublines of each stable transfectant were used throughout the study, and results for a representative clone of each transfectant are shown.Figure 1Inhibition of cell spreading by Chk overexpression.

Attachment of control cells (open bars) and Chk-overexpressing cells (shaded bars) to FN- or bovine serum albumin-coated plates was quantitated after incubation at 37 °C for 30 min or 60 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data represent the mean ± S.D. from triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When vector-transfected cells, which grow primarily in suspension, were seeded on a FN substrate, the cells attached to the substrate. The cell shape became irregular and the cell boundaries became difficult to visualize by phase contrast microscopy (Fig. 1 B, upper left panel), consistent with previous observations (38Kuchinke W. Funk C.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Spread cells with anti-vinculin staining showed focal adhesions around the cell periphery (lower left panel). In contrast, when Chk-overexpressing cells were stimulated with FN, the size and number of spread cells were significantly reduced, and the formation of focal adhesions was inhibited (right panels), indicating that Chk overexpression leads to poor cell spreading or no morphological change. The extent of cell spreading was quantitated by counting the number of cells that showed a flattened appearance, decreased cell refractility, and formation of projections after nonadherent cells were removed. Inhibition (>60%) of the number of cells spread was observed approximately 15 min after plating (Fig. 1 C). This inhibition lasted at least 1 day (data not shown), contrasting with delayed phenotypes in fibroblasts that lack c-Src (29Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). No differences in cell attachment to FN-coated plates were observed between Chk-overexpressing and control cells (Fig. 1 D), indicating that binding to a FN substrate is unaffected by Chk overexpression. FACS analysis showed that Dami cells expressed the VLA4 and VLA5 integrins as major receptors for FN, and their expression levels were not affected by Chk overexpression (Fig. 2 A). Cell spreading assays with blocking antibodies demonstrated that addition of an anti-VLA5 antibody, in contrast to that of an anti-VLA4 antibody, efficiently blocked cell spreading on a FN substrate (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that FN-induced cell spreading is mediated through VLA5 and that the expression level and binding activity of VLA5 to FN is unaffected by Chk overexpression. To examine the structures of Chk required for inhibition of FN-induced cell spreading, various mutant forms of Chk-FLAG were prepared (Fig. 3 A). Three mutants with deletions in the unique N-terminal, SH3, or SH2 domain (Chk ΔN, Chk ΔSH3, or Chk ΔSH2, respectively) and a kinase-inactive mutant (Chk K262R) (20Hirao A. Hamaguchi I. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were stably expressed in Dami cells. Each representative cell line produced a mutant protein of the predicted size, and the level of each mutant protein was comparable to or greater than that of Chk-FLAG (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the expression levels in all cases are >10-fold higher than those of endogenous Chk. Fig. 3 C shows that both Chk ΔSH3- and Chk K262R-expressing cells exhibited cell spreading on a FN substrate as did control cells (Vector), whereas cell spreading of Chk ΔSH2-expressing cells was significantly inhibited and Chk ΔN-expressing cells showed significant but intermediate inhibition. In addition, since the SH2 domain mutations in Csk are reported to destroy the kinase activity, probably due to susceptibility to denaturation upon cell lysis and immunoprecipitation (39Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 40Howell B.W. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5402-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 41Cloutier J.-F. Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we then examined whether the mutations in Chk affected kinase activities. In vitro kinase activities of the Chk mutants immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody were measured using poly(Glu, Tyr) as an exogenous substrate. Wild-type Chk and all mutants except the Chk K262R mutant were found to possess nearly the same kinase activity (data not shown). These results suggest that both the SH3 domain and kinase activity of Chk are required for inhibition of FN-induced cell spreading and that the unique N-terminal domain may partly contribute to the inhibition. Although Chk does not possess any known membrane anchoring motifs, about 45% of the overexpressed Chk and of the Chk ΔSH2 mutant as well as endogenous Chk were localized to the particulate fraction (P100) which contained cellular membranes, with the remainder in the cytosolic fraction (S100) which contained the cytosolic content (Fig. 3 D, upper panels). The Chk ΔN mutation reduced the proportion of membrane localization to <30% of the mutant, which corresponds to a weak inhibition of cell spreading observed in cells transfected with this construct (Fig. 3 C). However, it is important to note that the ΔSH3 mutation completely abrogated membrane-anchoring of Chk, resulting in cytosolic localization of the Chk ΔSH3 mutant, similar to that of the majority of Csk (Fig. 3 D, upper panel, lanes 7 and 8; upper middle panels, lanes 1–10). c-Src and Lyn were localized to the P100 fraction as expected due to their posttranslational lipid modification (lower panels). These results suggest that the SH3 domain of Chk is required for its membrane anchoring. Lyn was found to be extremely abundant among the Src family kinases present in Dami cells (data not shown). To examine the effect of FN stimulation on Lyn activity, Lyn was immunoprecipitated from the Triton X-100 lysates, and in vitro kinase assays were performed with enolase. FN stimulation of control cells increased Lyn kinase activity (Fig. 4 A, left panels). The level of Lyn activation, estimated to be ∼3-fold, was sustained with a moderate increase during 45 min of stimulation. In contrast, Lyn activation was suppressed in Chk-overexpressing cells (right panels), supporting the idea that Chk negatively regulates Lyn activity in vivo. Without stimulation, the level of Lyn activity in control cells was estimated to be comparable to that observed in Chk-overexpressing cells when activity was normalized to the amount of Lyn in each sample. In addition, c-Src activity in Chk-overexpressing or control cells was unchanged upon FN stimulation (data not shown). These results suggest that Chk overexpression suppresses FN-induced Lyn activation without affecting the basal activity. To examine whether the Chk SH3 domain was required for inhibition of FN-induced Lyn activation, the activities of Lyn were compared among the Chk mutant cells. Although the activation ratios in this experiment were slightly lower than those observed in Fig. 4 A, the activity of Lyn in Chk ΔSH3-expressing cells obviously increased in response to FN stimulation, similar to the result obtained from control cells (Fig. 4 B). On the other hand, the activity of Lyn in Chk ΔSH2-expressing cells was not augmented, similar to that seen in Chk-overexpressing cells. The activity of Lyn in Chk ΔN-expressing cells was partially inhibited, which corresponds to weak phenotypes of cell spreading and membrane anchoring (Fig. 3, C and D). Collectively, these results suggest that FN-induced cell spreading involves the activation of Lyn, and the Chk SH3 domain, which promotes membrane anchoring, is required for inhibition of Lyn activation. To further analyze kinetics of Lyn activation in control cells during FN stimulation, the levels of Lyn activity were quantitated. Fig. 4 C shows that a slight increase in Lyn activity was detected 5 min after stimulation and a 3-fold increase was sustained after 15 min, indicating that the kinetics roughly correspond to those of cell spreading (compare with Fig. 1 C). To explore whether activation of Lyn was required for FN-induced cell spreading, a truncated form of p56 Lyn lacking the kinase domain was stably expressed in Dami cells. Transfected cell lines produced mutant molecules of the predicted size of ∼34 kDa (Fig. 5 A). The expression levels were, however, varied and considerably lower than those of endogenous Lyn, suggesting that high expression of the Lyn mutant adversely affects cell growth. Nonetheless, expression of the Lyn mutant inhibited FN-induced cell spreading in a dose-dependent manner, indicative of a dominant-negative function (Fig. 5 B). Most spread cells expressing the Lyn mutant exhibited immature phenotypes similar to those seen in Chk-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1 B). To ascertain whether FN-induced Lyn activation was inhibited by expression of the Lyn mutant, Lyn was immunoprecipitated and subjected to in vitro kinase assays with enolase. Fig. 5 Cshows that FN stimulation of vector-transfected cells gave rise to an increase in Lyn activity and a clearly detectable increase in autophosphorylation of Lyn due to the larger amounts of Lyn used than those in Fig. 4. In contrast, activation of Lyn in cells expressing the Lyn mutant was strongly inhibited, similar to that seen in Chk-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4), although the expression levels of the Lyn mutant were restricted. Without FN stimulation, Lyn activity was unaffected either with or without expression of the Lyn mutant, consistent with results seen in Chk overexpression studies. Thus, Lyn activation is required for FN-induced cell spreading. In the present study, we demonstrate that Lyn plays a significant role in FN-induced cell spreading, but not cell attachment to a FN substrate, of the human megakaryocytic cell line Dami. Two lines of evidence suggest that sustained activation of Lyn is required for VLA5-mediated cell spreading of Dami cells. First, upon FN stimulation, cell spreading mediated through VLA5 accompanied a sustained increase in the kinase activity of Lyn with coincidental kinetics. Second, either overexpression of Chk or expression of a Lyn mutant lacking the kinase domain suppressed both FN-induced Lyn activation and cell spreading. Our recent findings have shown that Chk, which localizes to membranes, selectively suppresses the kinase activity of Lyn but not c-Src in platelets (20Hirao A. Hamaguchi I. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we overexpressed Chk in Dami cells and expected selective suppression of a Src family kinase in vivo, because Dami cells exhibit many of the morphological and biochemical characteristics of platelets and megakaryocytes (31Greenberg S.M. Rosenthal D.S. Greeley T.A. Tantravahi R. Handin R.I. Blood. 1988; 72: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kuchinke W. Funk C.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In fact, about half of the Chk protein present in Dami cells was localized to the particulate fraction via the SH3 domain (Fig. 3 D) and overexpression of Chk was able to suppress Lyn but not c-Src (Fig. 4; data not shown). Deletion of the SH3 domain caused not only cytoplasmic localization of Chk, similar to that of Csk, but also blocked inhibition of both FN-induced cell spreading and Lyn activation (Figs. 3 C and 4 B). The results that the kinase activity of Chk is required to inhibit Lyn activation (Fig. 3 C) are likely to lead to the notion that Chk phosphorylates the C-terminal negative regulatory tyrosine residue of Lyn, as we previously demonstrated in platelets (20Hirao A. Hamaguchi I. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These results suggest that membrane anchoring of Chk is crucial in suppression of Lyn activation in Dami cells. Indeed, we could detect a protein that specifically binds to the SH3 domain of Chk but not Csk. 2A. Hirao, X.-L. Huang, T. Suda, and N. Yamaguchi, unpublished observations. Moreover, the expression levels of the SH2 domain-deleted mutant of Chk in every clone which we selected were greater than those of all other Chk molecules (Fig. 3 B; data not shown). This suggests that a role of the SH2 domain, if any, might be masked by excess amounts of the SH2 domain-deleted mutant. Careful evaluation of a role of the SH2 domain of Chk in suppression of Lyn activity is needed. Previous reports have shown that Chk is present in the cytosolic, but not membrane, fraction in NIH3T3 fibroblasts transfected with Chk (18Chow L.M.L. Davidson D. Fournel M. Gosselin P. Lemieux S. Lyu M.S. Kozak C.A. Matis L.A. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3437-3448PubMed Google Scholar) and that ∼80% of Chk tagged with the Src-derived membrane targeting signal (Src-Chk) is located in the cytosolic fraction in BI-141 murine T cell hybridomas transfected with Src-Chk (23Davidson D. Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1355-1362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the human immature myeloid cell line KMT-2 (42Tamura S. Sugawara M. Tanaka H. Tezuka E. Nihira S. Miyamoto C. Suda T. Ohta Y. Blood. 1990; 76: 501-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Chk is present in the particulate fraction to an appreciable extent (our unpublished observations). It should be therefore emphasized that localization of Chk to membranes is restricted in certain cell types such as platelets/megakaryocytic and myeloid cells and may play a role in their function. Expression of Chk K262R apparently neither reduced nor augmented the sustained increase in Lyn activity induced by FN (data not shown), consistent with the results that cells expressing Chk K262R exhibited FN-induced cell spreading to nearly the same extent as did control cells (Fig. 3 C). It should be emphasized that Dami cells express endogenous Csk (Fig. 3 D). These results suggest that Csk, like Chk, might be involved in the regulation of FN-induced Lyn activation and cell spreading. The experiments with a Lyn mutant lacking the kinase domain demonstrated that activation of Lyn is required for cell spreading (Fig. 5). Either expression of the truncated Lyn or overexpression of Chk did not affect basal levels of Lyn activity (Figs. 4 and 5). These results suggest that the truncated Lyn or overexpressed Chk regulates Lyn activation only upon FN stimulation. Furthermore, expression of small amounts of the truncated Lyn showed a strong inhibitory effect on FN-induced Lyn activation (Fig. 5). Possibly, the ability of the truncated Lyn to be recruited to the sites of Lyn activation via its SH3 and SH2 domains may be greater than that of endogenous Lyn. This could result from freeing of the SH2 domain of Lyn as a consequence of removal of the C-terminal portion of the molecule. In addition, the inhibitory effects of the truncated Lyn on cell spreading were significant but not so drastic (Fig. 5 B). As the activation of Lyn was almost completely abolished under these conditions (Fig. 5 C), this finding suggests that suppression of Src family kinases might not fully explain the effect of Chk on cell spreading. Thus, these data may lead to the idea that in addition to the Src family kinases, Chk has other unidentified substrates, as has been suggested for Csk (30Bergman M. Joukov V. Virtanen I. Alitalo K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 711-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies with fibroblasts have shown that the lack of c-Src reduces a rate of FN-induced cell spreading although the cell spreading can be completed with normal flattened morphologies, and that the SH3 and SH2 domains of c-Src but not the kinase activity is sufficient to restore the rate of cell spreading (29Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, our findings show that either overexpression of Chk or expression of the truncated Lyn consisting of the SH3 and SH2 domains suppresses both cell spreading and Lyn activation throughout FN stimulation (Figs. 1 C, 4, and 5, B and C), and that the level of c-Src activity is unchanged during FN stimulation (data not shown), indicating that activation of Lyn is required for Dami cell spreading. We imagine the different roles for Src family kinases in cell adhesion between fibroblasts and Dami cells. Recent genetic analysis implicates the involvement of two Src family kinases, Hck and c-Fgr, in fibrinogen-induced cell spreading of polymorphonuclear cells mediated through β2 and β3 integrins (43Lowell C.A. Fumagalli L. Berton G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 895-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that Lyn activation is required for FN-induced Dami cell spreading mediated by VLA5 (α5β1 integrin) (Figs. 2 B,4, and 5). These data suggest that activation of Src family kinases mediated by integrins may play a critical role in cell spreading of hematopoietic cells. It is intriguing to speculate that a class of integrin may be functionally linked to a specific member(s) of Src family kinases since expression of individual integrins varies among different lineages of hematopoietic cells (25Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5856) Google Scholar, 26Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar, 27Hynes R.O.

On the basis of these findings, it should be emphasized that sustained activation of Lyn, which is regulated by membrane-anchored Chk, is indeed a critical step in VLA5-mediated cell spreading but not cell attachment to a FN substrate. Further exploration of relevant substrates of Lyn will help us to understand the regulatory mechanism of the spreading of cells through tyrosine phosphorylation. We are grateful to Drs. Tadashi Yamamoto and Hirofumi Nishizumi (The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo), Kazuo Maruyama (Tokyo Medical and Dental University), and Shigeyuki Nada (Osaka University) for generously providing the human Lyn cDNA, the pMKITneo vector, the pME18S vector, and the pMiwhph vector.

(1Sun H. Tonks N.K. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 480-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Metal ions like vanadate and molybdate are PTPase inhibitors (2Lerea K.M.

Many of the PTPase inhibitors are of low potency, especially in intact cells (5Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol.

Husøy T. Vikhamar G. Sanner T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the combination of vanadate and H2O2, two PTPase inhibitors of relatively low potency in intact cells, generates a much more potent inhibitor called pervanadate (PV) (9Kadota S. Fantus I.G. Deragon G. Guyda H.J. Hersh B. Posner B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) with a specificity differing from that of vanadate (10Fantus I.G. Kadota S. Deragon G. Foster B. Posner B.I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8864-8871Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). PV has been assumed to be vanadyl hydroperoxide (11Pumiglia K.M. Lau L.-F. Huang C.-K. Burroughs S. Feinstein M.B.

Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This conclusion is in line with analytical approaches (see Ref. 7Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A mixture of molybdate and H2O2, permolybdate (PMo), has many of the same properties as PV (14Haque S.J. Flati V. Deb A.

Acta. 1997; 1356: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The biological activity of PMo is consistent with PMo being diperoxomolybdate or tetraperoxodimolybdate (16Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1356: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PV and PMo have strong effects on cellular tyrosine phosphorylation (7Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O.

The compounds also induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) (8Mikalsen S.-O. Husøy T. Vikhamar G. Sanner T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and they affect gap junctional intercellular communication (7Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Husøy T. Mikalsen S.-O. Sanner T.

PV may be somewhat unstable under certain conditions (9Kadota S. Fantus I.G. Deragon G. Guyda H.J. Hersh B. Posner B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The procedure for generating PV and PMo can have a significant effect on the stabilities, and thereby also the potencies, of the compounds (7Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,16Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1356: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, there are no studies that have been fully dedicated to this problem. Because they are potent and useful experimental compounds with some potential for clinical therapies (15Li J. Elberg G. Gefel D. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6218-6225Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Shisheva A. Ikonomov O. Shechter Y. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it was of interest to perform such an investigation. We have here studied some factors that influence the stability and inactivation of PV and PMo. We show that the compounds are rapidly inactivated under normal cell culture conditions and that several factors are involved in the inactivation. Catalase (2× crystallized),N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) and para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) were purchased from Sigma. H2O2 and sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4 × 2H2O) were obtained from Aldrich. The concentration of the parent metal salt was always considered as the concentration of the peroxocompound. Throughout this work we have based the concentrations of vanadate on ε265 = 2925m−1cm−1 (20Goodno C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), although other values can also be found in the literature (ε260 = 3550m−1cm−1 (21Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar); in this case the concentrations will be 18.5% lower than shown). PV was made as a 30 mm stock solution using 60 mmH2O2 (7Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PMo was made as a 100 mmstock solution. HCl (120 mm) was added before 200 mm H2O2 (16Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1356: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mixtures were incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature before use. The compounds were often diluted in Ca2+/Mg2+-supplemented phosphate buffered saline (PBSS) (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.45 mm KH2PO4, 6.45 mmNa2HPO4, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2) or in Ca2+/Mg2+-supplemented Hepes-buffered saline (HBSS) (10 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2). Primary cell cultures from Syrian hamster (Wright, Chelmsford, Essex, UK) embryos were prepared as described (7Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,12Husøy T. Mikalsen S.-O. Sanner T. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2257-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells were used between passages 2 and 10. No differences in responses were found between early and later passages. The growth medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, NY) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and no antibiotics. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 10% CO2 atmosphere. When the cells were incubated in PBSS or HBSS, no CO2 was added to the atmosphere. The cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes. They reached confluence 2 days later. The cells were then exposed as indicated. They were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into electrophoresis sample buffer, and sonicated. Five μl (8–10 μg of protein) of the homogenate were used for electrophoresis and Western blotting as described previously (7Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Husøy T. Mikalsen S.-O. Sanner T. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2257-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), using rabbit anti-Cx43 antiserum (7Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Husøy T. Mikalsen S.-O. Sanner T. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2257-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) as primary antibodies. The band shift of Cx43 induced by PV (7Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or PMo (16Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1356: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) is fully developed after 15 min of exposure. The standard exposure time in this work, unless otherwise indicated, was therefore 15 min. Densitometry of blots were performed using NIH Image software 2The NIH Image software is obtainable on the Internet by anonymous file transfer protocol from ftp://zippy.nimh.nih.gov. on scans obtained with an Agfa Arcus scanner. PTPases hydrolyze pNPP efficiently (4Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6731-6737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Li J. Elberg G. Gefel D. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6218-6225Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2816-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pNPPase activity was measured as described (4Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6731-6737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2816-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications to achieve measurements on cells grown in 96-well plates. Cells (15,000 per well) were grown overnight. They were then exposed to the compounds in HBSS or PBSS (usually for 15 min) and rinsed in HBSS before the enzyme assay. Phosphatase assay buffer (50 μl of 37.5 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 30% (w/v) glycerol, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.15% Triton X-100, 5 mm freshly added DTT) was added directly to each well followed by 25 μl of 16 mm pNPP. Triton X-100 was included to obtain a rapid lysis of the cells. The detergent did not affect the pNPPase activity. DTT was increased to 5 mm to quench any remaining PV or PMo (see below). The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 3 m unbuffered Tris. The reactions were linear with regard to time and number of cells. The absorbance was read at 405 nm. The pNPPase data are shown as mean ± S.D. for n = 3–4, each in four parallel measurements, except for the kinetics data, which are shown as mean ± S.D. of 4 single independent measurements. The remaining biological activities were determined by the dose-dependent shift in alterations of the Cx43 band pattern or by the dose-dependent shift in IC50values of pNPPase. In both cases, the dose-response curve of test-treated (e.g. PV preincubated with in PBSS for 6 h) cultures were compared with the dose-response curve from control-treated cultures, i.e. PV or PMo diluted in PBSS and immediately added to the cells. Note that the 0 h incubation period in reality is a 1–3-min incubation due to the handling of dilutions and cells. The Western blot data shown are taken from one of several similar experiments. DTNB was used to measure cysteine in a cell-free reaction mixture and nonprotein thiols in cells (23Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21440) Google Scholar). For the former, 0.5 ml of 0.2 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 420 μl of water, 50 μl of sample, and 20 μl of DTNB (60 mm in Me2SO) were mixed. The samples were made by mixing PV, PMo, H2O2, or the parent metal salts with cysteine in appropriate amounts. Aliquots (50 μl) were withdrawn after different periods of time, and the remaining cysteine was measured at 412 nm. We modified the DTNB assay of glutathione to avoid the extraction of trichloroacetic acid with ether. The sensitivity is equal to that of the previous method. The dishes were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and 500 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid were added per dish. The cells were scraped off the dishes and transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes followed by sonication. The tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was used as sample. The assay buffer (pH 9.6) was 0.75m in both phosphate and Tris. The sample volume was diluted to 730 μl with 5% trichloroacetic acid and mixed with 20 μl of DTNB (60 mm in Me2SO). Assay buffer (250 μl) was added before a rapid vortexing, and absorbance at 412 nm was read. After mixing of all ingredients, the pH will be between 7.2 and 7.5. PV and PMo inhibit cytosolic PTPase with IC50 values of 3.3 and 10 μm, respectively, in a cell-free system (15Li J. Elberg G. Gefel D. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6218-6225Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, PMo was probably generated in a suboptimal way by Liet al. (15Li J. Elberg G. Gefel D. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6218-6225Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to investigate the relative potencies of phosphatase inhibition of the compounds in intact cells. The cells were exposed to PV, PMo, and the parent compounds vanadate, molybdate, and H2O2 during 15-min exposures in HBSS. Vanadate or molybdate slightly inhibited pNPPase at very high concentrations (Fig. 1), indicating reversibility of inhibition and/or low permeability into cells. H2O2 caused an inhibition of pNPPase activity, with IC50 = 1000 μm (Fig. 1). PV and PMo were significantly more potent than their parent compounds. PV inhibited pNPPase activity, with IC50 = 0.3 μm; for PMo, IC50 = 20 μm (Fig. 1). Around 20–25% of the pNPPase activity remained at high concentrations of PV or PMo, similar to previous observations with PV (24Zhao Z. Tan Z. Diltz C.D. You M. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22251-22255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained when the cells were exposed in PBSS. The pNPPase assay is simple and rapid, but it depends on the amount of cellular protein. On the other hand, induction of altered phosphorylation status of the gap junction protein Cx43, as evaluated by Western blot (7Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Mikalsen S.-O. Husøy T. Vikhamar G. Sanner T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Husøy T. Mikalsen S.-O. Sanner T. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2257-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1356: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), is less sensitive to variations in the amount of protein. Cx43 was therefore used as the principal model system to study the stability and inactivation of PV and PMo. The inhibition of pNPPase was used as a complementary approach. In control cells, Cx43 showed a pattern of three major and some minor bands (Fig. 2). The lower major band is the nonphosphorylated (NP) form of Cx43, and the two upper major bands are phosphorylated forms (P1 and P2) (12Husøy T. Mikalsen S.-O. Sanner T. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2257-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The P2 band was sometimes split into a double band (e.g. Fig. 2 D), and a faint band (P′) often appeared immediately above the NP band. Cells exposed to PV or PMo for 15 min showed prominent changes in the phosphorylation status (Fig. 2, A and B; see also densitometric scans in Fig. 3 C), characterized by decreased intensity of the NP band, a smear in the P1-P2 area, and the appearance of a band (P“) immediately below P1. The intensity of the P” band could vary somewhat between the experiments (compare Figs. 2 and3).Figure 3Dose responses for PV and PMo in cells incubated in PBSS. The compounds were diluted in PBSS before addition to the cells. The exposure period was 15 min. Cx43 band pattern was detected as described under “Materials and Methods.”A, dose response to PV.

Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Mikalsen S.-O. Kaalhus O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1356: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This could be due to regeneration of phosphatase activity in the cells (see below) and/or a decrease in concentration of the biologically active compounds in the medium. A transfer protocol was employed to investigate the latter possibility. One dish was exposed, and after 15 min, the spent medium was transferred to previously unexposed cells, and so on. PV (10 μm) was inactivated within 45–60 min, i.e.the active concentration of PV in the medium had become <2 μm (Fig. 2 C). The biological activity of PMo (300 μm) decreased to below detectable level,i.e. <70 μm, within 60–75 min (Fig. 2 D). Thus, the concentration of the biologically active compounds decreased during normal cell culture conditions. Three factors were likely to be involved: spontaneous inactivation, inactivation by factors in the growth medium (i.e. medium itself or FCS), or inactivation by the cells. Catalase has traditionally been added to the PV stock solutions to break down excess H2O2. PV has been claimed to be rather resistant against catalase (10Fantus I.G. Kadota S. Deragon G. Foster B. Posner B.I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8864-8871Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 17Kadota S. Fantus I.G. Deragon G. Guyda H.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8252-8256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our preliminary observations did not fully support this interpretation. It was first necessary to investigate the stability of the compounds in a buffer without catalase. We chose PBSS because this is a buffer that our cells tolerate well during incubations of up to 30 min and because phosphate is present in the medium. Both PV and PMo were more potent when the cells were incubated in PBSS than in the growth medium (compare Fig. 2,A and B, to Fig. 3, A and B). This suggested that components in the growth medium could inactivate the compounds (see below). PMo and PV were relatively stable (no measurable breakdown) for at least 6 h when kept in stock solution at room temperature and protected from light as measured by the Cx43 and pNPPase assays (not shown). When incubated in diluted solutions (0.15–20 μm PV or 6–300 μm PMo in PBSS) in the dark at 37 °C, both compounds showed an evident time-dependent breakdown (Fig. 4 A). After 6 h of incubation, around 20–30% of the original potencies were present as indicated by both Cx43 and pNPPase assays (Fig. 4 A). PV and PMo were clearly sensitive to catalase. The compounds lost their ability to induce the characteristic band shift of Cx43 in a manner dependent on both the incubation time with catalase and the amount of catalase, but PMo was 100-fold more sensitive to catalase (Fig. 4 B). The reason for the higher sensitivity to catalase of PMo is uncertain, but in crystals, the Mo—Operoxo bonds are 0.1 Å longer than the V—Operoxo bonds (25Svensson I.-B. Stomberg R. Acta Chem. Scand. 1971; 25: 898-910Crossref Google Scholar). There may, therefore, be less steric hindrance involved in catalase approaching the peroxo-groups in PMo. The inactivation of PV by exogenous catalase is apparently in contrast to previous results (17Kadota S. Fantus I.G. Deragon G. Guyda H.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8252-8256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which a rapid inactivation of PV was found when catalase was added simultaneously with the mixing of vanadate and H2O2. The inactivation was slower when catalase was added 10 min or more after mixing (17Kadota S. Fantus I.G. Deragon G. Guyda H.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8252-8256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When catalase was added in the present experiments, it was done 15 min after mixing of metal salts and H2O2. The catalase-induced inactivation is dependent on the amount of added enzyme (Fig. 4 B). By extension, the inactivation also depend on the specific activity of the enzyme. Our results are consistent with analytical work showing that PV is degraded by catalase at a rate of 1–2% of that of H2O2 (26Ravishankar H.N. Rao A.V.S. Ramasarma T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, high concentrations of PV partly inhibit the catalase action on H2O2 (26Ravishankar H.N. Rao A.V.S. Ramasarma T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Various concentrations of PV or PMo were incubated in PBSS with 10% FCS or in DMEM (without FCS) for periods between 0 and 6 h before exposure to the cells for 15 min. The mixing of the compounds with PBSS/FCS rapidly (1–3 min, see “Materials and Methods”) inactivated around 30% of the activity in the diluted solutions (Fig. 5 A). Thereafter followed a slower breakdown, leaving 5–10% of the activity after 6 h of incubation (Fig. 5 A). DMEM was an efficient inactivator of the diluted compounds. By 1–3 min after mixing, 70–80% of the biological activity had disappeared. After 1 h of preincubation, less than 5% of the activity remained (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, when 1 mm PV was preincubated in DMEM for 1 h and then diluted and assayed in PBSS, around 70% of the activity remained (not shown). This suggests that there are ingredients at relatively low concentrations in the DMEM that rapidly inactivate the compounds. A practical implication is that the potencies of PV and PMo are partly dependent on the exact procedure during the exposure. The reaction of thiols with PV and PMo is of interest for two reasons. First, cysteine is the reactive part of glutathione, a major detoxification system in cells. Second, PV and PMo are PTPase inhibitors. All PTPases have a cysteine residue in the active site, which could be a participant in the inhibitory effect of the peroxocompounds. We have therefore used cysteine as the major model compound in studies of the reaction between thiol and peroxocompounds. It has been reported that glutathione may reduce vanadate to vanadyl in cells (Ref. 27Macara I.G. Kustin K. Cantley Jr., L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 629: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar; see also Ref. 28Li J. Elberg G. Crans D.C. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8314-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and that glutathione could react with PV and PMo in a 1:1 molar ratio (15Li J. Elberg G. Gefel D. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6218-6225Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The consumption of cysteine was measured during the reaction with the peroxocompounds by a spectrophotometric assay (Fig. 6). We also determined the remaining biological activity after such reactions (see Fig. 11). H2O2 caused 5–15% of the cysteine to be consumed within 5 s. The curves approximately followed one-phase exponential decay irrespective of whether 1, 2, or 3 molar equivalents of cysteine were added. There was no remaining cysteine after 15 min of reaction time (Fig. 6 A). Vanadate needed about 2 h to consume an equimolar amount of cysteine, and the curve followed an approximately linear decay (Fig. 6 B). PV showed a more complex consumption curve. There was a very rapid initial decrease in cysteine, corresponding to approximately one consumed cysteine during the first 5 s, and then another cysteine consumed at 120 s (Fig. 6 B, inset). The subsequent decrease was approximately linear with time, paralleling that of vanadate-induced removal of cysteine (Fig. 6 B). Indeed, UV spectrophotometric measurements showed that the reaction product of PV and thiol possessed a peak at the same wavelength (265 nm at pH 11.0) and height as expected for vanadate, but with higher absorbance at lower wavelengths (not shown). The peak was fully developed at 1.5–2 molar equivalents of cysteine added.Figure 11Model of remaining biological activity of PV (A) or PMo (B) after reaction with thiols.The peroxocompounds were made as 30 or 100 mm stock solutions as described. They were diluted in PBSS to 1 mm. To the PV solution, cysteine (100 mm stock solution in water) was added to 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, or 1.5 mm, or DTT (50 mm stock solution in water) was added to 0.25, 0.375, or 0.5 mm. To the PMo solution, cysteine was added to 1, 2, or 3 mm, or DTT was added to 0.5, 1, or 1.5 mm. After 20"

IL-13 binds primarily to the IL-13Rα1 with subsequent sequestration of the IL-4Rα into the complex. IL-13Rα1 may also be found in those receptors capable of binding IL-4. γ chain (γc) participates in receptors capable of binding IL-4 but is not found in association with bound IL-13. Dimeric receptors composed of the IL-4Rα complexed with either the IL-13Rα1 or γc occur simultaneously within defined B cell populations. mRNAs for all receptor constituents are increased subsequent to immunoglobulin stimulation alone, while maximal expression of IL-13Rα1 is more dependent upon co-stimulation of immunoglobulin and CD40 receptors. mRNA levels for IL-13Rα1 vary over a wider range subsequent to surface stimulation than other receptor components. Although γc is not bound to IL-13 in B cells under the conditions evaluated, it may influence IL-13 binding by competing with IL-13Rα1 for association/sequestration with the IL-4Rα chain.

Several configurations for the IL-4 receptor have been postulated based on variations in the smaller molecular weight component of a 140-kDa/70-kDa multimeric complex. In T cells, the 70-kDa entity has definitively been shown to be γc, a protein that is shared among several receptor types, including those for IL-2, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 (8Callard R.E. Matthews D.J.

The receptor capable of binding IL-13 appears to vary structurally and functionally depending upon the cell of origin (6Kotowicz K. Callard R.E. Friedrich K. Matthews D.J. Kline N. Int.

Human cell populations that bind IL-13 with high affinity include several renal cell carcinoma lines, the glioma line U251, and the ovarian cancer cell line IGROV-1 (13Obiri N.I. Leland P. Murata T. Murata T. Debinski W. Puri R.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 756-764PubMed Google Scholar, 28Murata T. Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Puri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It has recently been hypothesized that in these cell lines isodimers of the IL-13 binding proteins may result in the reported high affinity IL-13 binding (28Murata T. Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Puri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Multiple cell types including the ovarian cancer cell line PA1, an epidermal carcinoma line A431, a primate fibroblast line COS-7, and normal human endothelial cells bind both IL-4 and IL-13, although some cell types preferentially bind IL-4. It has been suggested from a combination of functional and structural studies that these populations possess IL-13 receptors composed of an IL-13-specific binding component in conjunction with IL-4Rα (13Obiri N.I. Leland P. Murata T. Murata T. Debinski W. Puri R.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 756-764PubMed Google Scholar). Evaluation of the erythroleukemia cell line TF-1 suggests that the γc protein may participate as part of a functional IL-13 receptor. A potential role for γc has also been suggested from studies evaluating phorbol dibutyrate and ionomycin-stimulated B cells exposed to high IL-13 concentrations (29Rolling C. Treton D. Pellegrini S. Galanaud P. Richard Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Whether γc acts directly as a binding element or as part of the signal transduction mechanism in these cells remains to be definitively determined. Evaluation of the IL-13 receptor on human B cells has mainly focused upon Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell populations as well as functional studies on B cells derived from X-SCID patients (21Matthews D.J.

Blood. 1995; 85: 38-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of IL-13 receptor-related proliferation has recently been extended to cells derived from patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as partially purified B cells from reactive lymph nodes (31Billard C. Caput D. Vita N. Ferrara P. Orrico M. Gaulard P. Bourmsell L. Bensussan A. Farcet J.-P. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1997; 8: 19-27PubMed Google Scholar). In the present series of experiments, normal, nonvirally transformed, purified mature human B lymphocytes have been directly evaluated both structurally and functionally. Prior examination of receptor binding on Epstein-Barr virus-transformed or freshly isolated B cells has been hindered by relatively low binding of radiolabeled native IL-13 in part secondary to low receptor numbers (10Murata T. Puri R.K. Cell. Immunol. 1997; 176: 33-40Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 756-764PubMed Google Scholar). Herein, these difficulties have been partially overcome by utilization of a mutant IL-13 moiety that can be labeled to high specific activity in association with specific external activation conditions that substantially up-regulate ligand binding components (12Vita N. Lefort S. Laurent P. Caput D. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3512-3517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, we report the initial utilization of antibodies specific for the IL-13Rα1 binding proteins with direct identification of those elements involved in cytokine binding and receptor coaggregation to permit a detailed, direct assessment of receptor structure on normal lymphoid cells. Recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2) was obtained from Genzyme Corp. (Boston, MA), and rhIL-4, rhIL-6, rhIL-10, rhIL-13, rhIL-15, and recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α were procured from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). F(ab′)2fragments of rabbit anti-human IgM antibody, specific for the μ chain, were obtained from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA) and used at 10 μg/ml. Coupled rabbit anti-human IgM antibody, μ chain-specific, was acquired from Irvine Scientific (Santa Anna, CA) and used in proliferation experiments at 7.5 μg/ml. An anti-CD40 mouse monoclonal antibody (32Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4494-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) was derived and purified from the G28-5 cell line (American Type Culture Collection, Bethesda, MD). Anti-CD40 antibody was used at 5 μg/ml in specified assays. Goat anti-human κ and anti-human λ antibodies were purchased from Biosource International (Camarillo, CA). Rabbit anti-human κ and anti-human λ antibodies were obtained from Dako Corp. Anti-human κ and anti-human λ antibodies were covalently coupled to activated Immunobead Matrix from Irvine Scientific (Santa Anna, CA) and used at 1.6 μg/ml. Polyclonal antisera to a synthetic peptide derived from the deduced sequence of IL-13Rα1 was prepared in collaboration with Zymed, Inc. (San Francisco, CA). The carboxyl-terminal peptides 379–397 of the deduced IL-13Rα1 sequence were utilized. [Phe43]IL-13-GYGY was prepared as described previously (12Vita N. Lefort S. Laurent P. Caput D. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3512-3517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Na125I and125I-labeled IL-4 (125I-IL-4) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Anti-CD45FITC/CD14PE, anti-CD3FITC/CD19PE, anti-CD20FITC, and the isotype control IgG1FITC/IgG1PE were obtained from Immunotech (Westbrook, ME). FITC-conjugated anti-IgD, anti-IgM, and anti-IgG antibodies were acquired from Caltag Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). Anti-CD38PE and anti-CD44FITC were from Becton-Dickinson (San Jose, CA). Tonsillar human B lymphocytes, ≥98% pure, were prepared as described previously (33Morgan J.W. Morgan D.M. Lasky S. Ford D. Kouttab N. Maizel A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2900-2908PubMed Google Scholar). For specific experiments, tonsillar B lymphocytes were fractionated on Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) density gradients and separated essentially as described (34Coligan, J., Kruisbeek, A. M., Margulies, E. H., Shevach, E. M., and Stober, W. (eds) Current Protocols in Immunology, Vol. 3, pp. 3.8.11–3.8.13, John Wiley & Sons, New York.Google Scholar) with the exception that Percoll mix solution was substituted for Hanks' balanced salt solution. The density of cells prepared in this manner may be categorized as high (>1.094 g/ml of Percoll solution), moderate (>1.089 g/ml), or low (>1.082 g/ml). Phenotypic analysis, performed on a minimum of 2 × 105 cells/evaluation, utilized a Becton-Dickinson FACScan. High density tonsillar B lymphocytes are characterized phenotypically as the following: 1 ± 1% CD3+, 99 ± 2% CD19+, 7 ± 2% CD38bright+, 93 ± 2% CD38dim+, 85 ± 4% CD44+, 53 ± 6% IgD+, 15 ± 12% IgG+, and 65 ± 5% IgM+; moderate density cells as 0 ± 0% CD3+, 99 ± 1% CD19+, 23 ± 4% CD38bright+, 77 ± 4% CD38dim+, 66 ± 6% CD44+, 36 ± 5% IgD+, 35 ± 13% IgG+, and 54 ± 10% IgM+; and low density cells as 0 ± 0% CD3+, 100 ± 0% CD19+, 56 ± 8% CD38bright+, 44 ± 8% CD38dim+, 21 ± 2% CD44+, 8 ± 3% IgD+, 41 ± 14% IgG+, and 31 ± 12% IgM+. Cell proliferation, as measured by thymidine incorporation, was performed as described previously (33Morgan J.W. Morgan D.M. Lasky S. Ford D. Kouttab N. Maizel A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2900-2908PubMed Google Scholar). The S.E. values of triplicates within an individual experiment were invariably less than 10%. The percentage of cells in S phase was determined by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometric analysis as described by Look et al. (35Look A.T. Melvin S.L. Williams D.L. Blood. 1982; 60: 959-968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biologically functional125I-labeled [Phe43]IL-13-GYGY (125I-IL-13, 60–100 μCi/μg) was prepared by methods essentially as described previously (12Vita N. Lefort S. Laurent P. Caput D. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3512-3517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Modifications to the procedure included a stepwise addition of four 2-μl aliquots of 30 nm chloramine T at 1-min intervals and fractionation of the labeled product via Sephadex G-25 chromatography. Ligand affinity was evaluated utilizing a two-step paradigm. Initially, the binding of the radiolabeled ligand was determined to evaluate effects introduced by the labeling procedure. The dissociation constant (Kd) of the labeled ligand was then used to calculate the affinity of the native ligand according to the procedures of Munson et al. using Ligand software (36Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). The receptor number and binding affinity were determined from the Scatchard and displacement analyses of 3–5 replicate experiments. The receptor competitions for specific cytokines were performed in RPMI medium containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin with 2 nm125I-labeled IL-4 and 30 nm125I-labeled [Phe43]IL-13-GYGY as indicated in the figure legends. The total binding reaction volume was 35 μl or 0.3 ml as indicated in figure legends. Activated B lymphocytes were removed from culture; washed twice with RPMI 1640, 0.25% bovine serum albumin; and subsequently incubated with radioiodinated IL-4 or IL-13-GYGY for 30 min at 37 °C or for 2–3 h at 4 °C. The cells were incubated in the absence or presence of excess unlabeled ligand. Reactions were stopped by the addition of cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% azide and 100 μm Na3VO4. Receptor cross-linking was performed by incubation of washed cells in 1 mmdisuccinimidyl suberate or BS3, at 14 or 4 °C, respectively, for 20–30 min. The washed cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% Brij 96, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm PMSF, 10 mm aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) incubated for 15–30 min on ice, and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × gat 4 °C. Supernatants were either boiled in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by 7–7.5% SDS-PAGE or were further immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies. Solubilized samples to be immunoprecipitated were exposed overnight, at 4 °C, with either 10 μg of purified, polyclonal rabbit anti-human receptor component antibody (anti-IL-3Rα1, anti-IL-4Rα) or 3 μl of rat monoclonal anti-human γc ascites (Tugh4 kindly provided by Dr. Sagamura). The anti-IL-4Rα utilized was a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against a C-terminal peptide corresponding to amino acids 801–820 of the mature protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-IL-13Rα1 antibody was prepared as described above. Immunoprecipitated complexes, isolated with protein G-Sepharose beads, were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE. IL-13Rα1, IL-13Rα2, IL-4Rα, and γc mRNA levels were assessed using RT-PCR with primers derived from published sequences (see below) (19Noguchi M. Nakamura Y. Russell S.M. Ziegler S.F. Tsang M. Cao X.

B lymphocytes (107) were harvested, and total RNA was prepared using Trizol® (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent or RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen). 2–5 μg of total RNA were used as a template for oligo(dT)-primed cDNA synthesis using a cDNA cycle kit (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA or Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNA quality and quantity were standardized using RT-PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and/or β-actin (CLONTECH). A hot start technique was employed in 50-μl reactions with GeneAmp® buffer (Perkin-Elmer), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm GeneAmp deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Perkin-Elmer), 5–10 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 1.5 units of ampliTaq® DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). For semiquantitative reactions, 30 cycles (94 °C for 1 min; 59 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 1.5 min) of amplification were performed, and a minimum of three dilutions were evaluated for each sample. Nested reactions were performed using 5 μl of the primary reaction as template for the secondary reaction. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose or 10% acrylamide gels, stained with ethidium bromide, photographed, dried, and autoradiographed. Band intensity was quantitated and presented in relative arbitrary units. For quantitative competitive PCR, cloned competitive substrates were prepared from cDNA as described using the indicated primers (39Forster E. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). A constant known amount of competitive substrate was added to each PCR reaction, and the amount of cDNA was evaluated in reference to the intensity of the competitive band. Amplicon number was calculated based on the concentration of the competitive substrate.

Without exogenous stimulation, ≥98% of these cells were in G0/G1. B lymphocytes were stimulated with either insolubilized anti-immunoglobulin M (anti-μ) and/or soluble anti-CD40 antibodies in the presence or absence of individual cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-15, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Stimulation of B cells by ligation of both the antigen and CD40 receptors in combination with a cytokine provided the strongest proliferative response. The relative mitogenic efficacy, dependent upon dual surface receptor ligation, was IL-4 ≥ IL-13. These cytokines showed a consistent proliferative effect when utilized at ≤10−9m. IL-2 and IL-15 produced significant effects only at concentrations ≥10−8m. Similar rank orders of proliferative efficacy were seen when cells were solely stimulated by either ligation of the immunoglobulin receptor or CD40 receptor alone followed by cytokine exposure, with soluble anti-CD40 being the least effective stimulus. Fig. 1,A–F, presents binding curves and Scatchard analyses for radiolabeled IL-4 and IL-13. The affinity constants given in the legend to Fig. 1 were used to calculate native ligand binding values. Table II shows the affinity and binding site determinations for native IL-4 and IL-13 as a function of surface stimulation. Anti-μ stimulation alone resulted in the appearance of 1498 ± 224 IL-4 sites/cell of high affinity with aKd of 41 ± 10 pm. After cross-linking both surface receptors, surface immunoglobulin and CD40, 1398 ± 151 IL-4 receptor sites/cell were found to have aKd of 37 ± 7 pm. Examining B cells stimulated with anti-μ alone, the Kd and site number for IL-13 could not be reliably calculated due to the low level of specific binding, which resulted in high coefficients of variation. In the presence of both anti-immunoglobulin and anti-CD40 antibodies, 745 ± 51 IL-13 binding sites/cell were found with an intermediate affinity of 0.91 ± 0.08 nm.Table IIIL-4 and IL-13 binding parametersLigandActivatorKd2-aEach value is the average of at least three experiments ± S.E.Sites/cellIL-4Anti-μ41 ± 10 pM1498 ± 224IL-4Anti-μ plus anti-CD4037 ± 7 pM1398 ± 151IL-13Anti-μ—2-bKd and site number could not be reliably calculated due to low specific binding of 125I-IL-13.—IL-13Anti-μ plus anti-CD400.910 ± 0.08 nM745 ± 512-a Each value is the average of at least three experiments ± S.E.2-b Kd and site number could not be reliably calculated due to low specific binding of 125I-IL-13.

Conversely, as seen in Fig. 2 B, unlabeled IL-13 completely blocked radiolabeled IL-13 binding, and unlabeled IL-4 displaced 87% of the ligand (n = 4) (control lanes, no preincubating cytokines). Neither radiolabeled IL-4 nor IL-13 were displaced by excess unlabeled IL-2 (Fig. 2, A and B, control lanes, respectively). The actual binding assays depicted in Fig. 2,A and B, were conducted with an incubation period of 1–2 h at 4 °C, conditions associated with minimal receptor internalization/down-regulation. However, incubation of cells with ligand at 37 °C is associated with such internalization/down-regulation (40Galizzi J.P. Zubler C.E. Cabrillat H. Djossou O. Banchereau J. J. Biol.

To determine the efficacy of each cytokine to occupy and/or internalize IL-4 and IL-13 receptors, high density cells were stimulated in culture with anti-μ and anti-CD40 antibodies in the presence or absence of unlabeled ligands. After the cultures were maintained at 37 °C for 24–36 h, the cells were tested for radiolabeled ligand binding and for competition of that binding by an unlabeled growth factor.

Mutation of the central Tyr497 to Phe blocks the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and diminishes proliferation in response to IL-4. Recent data suggest that the I4R motif encodes binding sites for several protein tyrosine binding (PTB) domain-containing proteins such as IRS1 and Shc and potentially for the Src homology 2 domain of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). To analyze the function of the I4R motif in regulating IL-4 signaling, we changed conserved residues upstream and downstream of the central Tyr to Ala in the human IL-4Rα. We analyzed the ability of these constructs to signal the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 and STAT6, the induction of DNA binding activity, and CD23 induction in response to human IL-4 (huIL-4) in transfected M12.4.1 cells. Mutagenesis of residues downstream of Tyr497, such as Arg498 or Phe500, to Ala had no effect on any of these responses, suggesting that the I4R motif may not be important for functional Src homology 2 domain interactions. However, mutagenesis of Pro488 to Ala (P488A) greatly diminished the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 and abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6, induction of DNA binding activity, and CD23 induction in response to huIL-4. By contrast, a P488G mutant signaled these responses to huIL-4. Mutagenesis of hydrophobic amino acids previously shown to contact the PTB domain of IRS1, Leu489 or Ile491, to Ala had only minimal effects on responses to huIL-4. However, changing both Leu498 and Ile491 to Ala greatly diminished the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 and abolished STAT6 activation. Taken together, these results indicate the important role of the I4R motif in regulating IRS docking and suggest that I4R docking to a PTB domain-containing protein regulates activation of the STAT6 pathway.

Blood. 1991; 77: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In murine lymphoid cells, the receptor complex predominantly consists of a 140-kDa, high affinity binding chain (IL-4Rα) and the common γ-chain (γc) (2Keegan A.D. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Immunologist. 1996; 4: 194-198Google Scholar) that is also a component of the receptors for IL-2, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 (3Leonard W.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1996; 47: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Both chains of the IL-4 receptor complex are members of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily (4Cosman D. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). These receptor subunits do not contain any consensus sequences encoding tyrosine or serine/threonine kinases. However, it has been shown that the IL-4Rα associates with the Janus family kinase JAK-1 (5Yin T. Tsang M.L. Yang Y-C. J. Biol.

IRS1 and IRS2 are large cytoplasmic proteins (170–180 kDa) that contain numerous potential tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation sites. Tyrosine-phosphorylated sites within IRS1 and IRS2 associate with SH2 domains found in cytoplasmic signaling molecules, including the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2. IRS1 and IRS2 have been shown to regulate both the proliferation and the protection from apoptosis of a factor-dependent myeloid cell line 32D in response to IL-4 (10Sun X-J. Wang L-M. Zhang Y.

Pierce J.H. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Mutation of the central Tyr497 to Phe blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and diminished proliferation in response to IL-4 in 32D cells. It has been shown that IRS1 contains a protein tyrosine binding (PTB) domain, also called a phosphotyrosine interaction domain (14Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell.

Several independent studies have demonstrated that the I4R motif encodes a binding site for the PTB domain of IRS1/2 and Shc (17Wolf G. Trub T Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M.

In addition to IRS family members, IL-4 also induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of a member of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family, STAT6 (20Darnell J. Kerr I.

The general model is that after tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT6 dimerizes in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus, and subsequently binds to consensus sequences (termed γ-activated sequences) found within the promoter regions of IL-4-inducible genes. Recent studies of mice with a targeted disruption of the STAT6 gene clearly demonstrate that STAT6 is necessary for the induction of genes (CD23, major histocompatibility complexes II and Iε, and IL-4Rα genes) in response to IL-4 (24Kaplan M.H.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the IRS and STAT6 pathways are separate at the initiation phase of the signal. In 32D cells lacking IRS expression, IL-4 treatment was able to activate the DNA binding activity of STAT6 as well as in cells expressing IRS1 (27Pernis A. Witthuhn B. Keegan A.D. Nelms K. Garfein E. Ihle J.N. Paul W.E. Pierce J.H. Rothman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7971-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On the other hand, IL-4 was able to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 in lymphocytes derived from mice deficient in STAT6 expression as well as in lymphocytes derived from normal mice (28Wang H.Y. Zamorano J. Yoerkie J.L. Paul W, E. Keegan A.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1037-1040PubMed Google Scholar). A series of deletion, mutagenesis, and chimeric receptor studies of the huIL-4Rα (13Keegan A.D.

They also indicated that STAT6 activation, in the absence of IRS activation, was sufficient to signal maximal CD23 induction in these cells. Furthermore, these same studies also suggested that Tyr497 in the I4R motif could signal partial STAT6 activation, implying that any one of the first four cytoplasmic tyrosine residues could potentially act as a docking site for the SH2 domain of STAT6. Interestingly, mutation of Tyr497 to Phe, known to consistently affect activation of the IRS pathway in response to IL-4 (13Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M.F. Wang L-M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E.

To analyze the function of the I4R motif in regulating IL-4 signaling in detail, we changed conserved residues upstream and downstream of the central Tyr to Ala. We analyzed the ability of these constructs to signal the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 and STAT6, the induction of DNA binding activity, and CD23 induction in response to huIL-4 in transfected M12.4.1 cells. The results presented herein indicate the important role of the I4R motif in regulating IRS recruitment and suggest that I4R docking to a PTB domain-containing protein(s) regulates activation of the STAT6 pathway. The murine B cell lymphoma M12.4.1 (obtained from Dr. Richard Asofsky, NIAID, National Institutes of Health) was maintained in RPMI (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 × 10−7m 2-mercaptoethanol. Recombinant muIL-4 and recombinant huIL-4 were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). For the mutagenesis, we cloned the huIL-4R cDNA (provided by Dr. Melanie Spriggs, Immunex, Seattle, WA) into the pAlter-1 vector obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Amino acid numbering begins with +1 as the initiator methionine of the signal peptide of the huIL-4Rα cDNA. There are 25 amino acids in the signal peptide. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using mutant oligonucleotides that would convert the wild type codons to an A codon (or as indicated a G). For example, the oligonucleotide used for the L489A mutation was designed as follows: 5′-ACA GAG ACG CCCGCC GTC ATC GCA GGC-3′ (L489A). We prepared single-stranded DNA containing the huIL-4Rα using helper phage R408. The mutant oligonucleotides were annealed with aliquots of the single-stranded DNA along with an oligonucleotide that repairs the mutation in the ampicillin resistance gene. Subsequently, synthesis and ligation were performed to link them. The DNA was transformed into a repair minus strain of Escherichia coli (BMH 71–18 mutS), and the cells were grown in the presence of ampicillin. A second round of transformation in JM109 and selection for ampicillin resistance was performed. Bacterial colonies containing the desired mutation were identified by sequence analysis of plasmid DNA. Mutant huIL-4Rα was then cloned into the EcoRI site of pME18s. M12.4.1 cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. For each transfection, 2 × 107 cells were mixed with 2 μg of vector carrying neomycin resistance and 20 μg of huIL-4Rα-pME18s and subjected to electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser set on 200 V and 960 microfarads. After transfection, the cells were cultured overnight before selection with 800 μg/ml neomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Neomycin-resistant cells were tested for the expression of huIL-4Rα by FACS analysis using monoclonal antibodies, M8 and M10 (a generous gift from Dr. Melanie Spriggs, Immunex, Seattle, WA) as described previously (13Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M.F. Wang L-M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Analysis of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins was performed as described previously (32Keegan A.D. Beckmann M.P. Park L.S. Paul W.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2272-2279PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were deprived of serum in RPMI for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing, 107 cells were resuspended in RPMI with 50 μmNa3VO4 and incubated in the presence or absence of murine or human IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by 10-fold dilution in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μmNa3VO4. Cell pellets were lysed in HEPES lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture) and clarified. The soluble fraction was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-IRS (a generous gift of Drs. Ling-Mei Wang and Jacalyn Pierce, NCI, National Institutes of Health), anti-STAT6 (Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-JAK3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The precipitates were washed in lysis buffer and solubilized in SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels before transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were then probed with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, RC20-H (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). The bound antibody was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Where indicated, the blots were stripped and probed with control antibodies. Band intensities were analyzed using the public domain software NIH Image. M12.4.1 cells expressing huIL-4Rα constructs were incubated with media, 10 ng/ml muIL-4, or 10 ng/ml huIL-4 as indicated for 30 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Total cell extracts were prepared exactly as described (29Ryan J.J. McReynolds L.J. Wang L-H. Keegan A.D. Garfein E. Rothman P. Nelms K. Paul W.E. Immunity. 1996; 4: 123-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and stored at −70 until use. Extracts (4 μg) were incubated with 1 ng of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (5 × 105 cpm) corresponding to the N4 γ-activated sequence element found in the promoter of the Cε gene (5′-CAACTTCCCAAGAACAGA) at room temperature for 20 min as described previously (29Ryan J.J. McReynolds L.J. Wang L-H. Keegan A.D. Garfein E. Rothman P. Nelms K. Paul W.E. Immunity. 1996; 4: 123-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Where indicated, unlabeled Cε probe, anti-STAT3, or anti-STAT6 (1 μg, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were included in the binding reaction. Protein-DNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 4.5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.22× TBE followed by autoradiography. M12.4.1 cells expressing the various constructs of the huIL-4Rα were incubated at 1 × 105/ml in media in the presence or absence of murine or human IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for 48 h at 37 °C. Expression of murine CD23 was tested by FACS analysis using fluorescein isothiocyanate-B3B4 (anti-murine CD23), a generous gift of Dr. Daniel H. Conrad (MCV, Richmond, VA), in the presence of the anti-Fc receptor antibody 2.4G2 to block Fc binding before analysis on a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson). For binding and cross-linking studies, 125I-huIL-4 was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Saturation binding analyses were done using 25 ng/ml 125I-huIL-4 essentially as described previously (13Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M.F. Wang L-M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). 125I-huIL-4 was cross-linked to the IL-4 receptor complex using 3 mmbis(sulfosuccidinimidyl)suberate (Pierce) as described previously (32Keegan A.D. Beckmann M.P. Park L.S. Paul W.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2272-2279PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the central tyrosine in the I4R motif (Tyr497) of the huIL-4Rα is critical for the recruitment of IRS1 to the IL-4 receptor complex and the activation of the IRS pathway. These studies also suggested that Tyr497has some capacity to recruit STAT6 and to influence the activation of the STAT6 pathway. Residues downstream of phosphotyrosines participate in the binding to SH2 domains, especially the +1 and +3 residues (33Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). It has recently become clear that residues upstream of phosphotyrosines participate in the binding to PTB domains (19Zhou M.M. Huang B. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Shuker S.B. Miyazaki M. Trub T. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). Therefore, we changed conserved residues upstream and downstream of the central tyrosine, those likely to participate in PTB or SH2 domain binding, respectively, to alanine (Fig. 1) to further understand the role of the I4R motif of the huIL-4Rα. We transfected these huIL-4Rα constructs into the murine B lymphoma M12.4.1 and screened for stable expression by FACS using monoclonal anti-huIL-4Rα (data not shown). Receptor expression was verified using 125I-huIL-4 binding assays. All clones demonstrated similar levels of expression of the transfected huIL-4Rα ranging from 1000 to 4000 molecules/cell. We analyzed the ability of these mutant receptors to transmit signals in response to huIL-4. Since M12.4.1 cells express endogenous muIL-4 receptors and human and murine IL-4 do not cross-bind, we used muIL-4 as a positive control for each transfectant. For each of the responses assayed, we show representative results for each construct; at least three independent clones expressing the indicated constructs gave comparable results. We first analyzed the ability of these mutant receptors to signal the activation of the IRS pathway in response to huIL-4 by analyzing the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 (Fig. 2). All M12.4.1 cells demonstrated the tyrosine phsophorylation of IRS2 in response to muIL-4. M12.4.1 cells expressing the wild type (WT) huIL-4Rα demonstrated potent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 in response to human IL-4, as expected (29Ryan J.J. McReynolds L.J. Wang L-H. Keegan A.D. Garfein E. Rothman P. Nelms K. Paul W.E. Immunity. 1996; 4: 123-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cells expressing receptors with mutations downstream of Tyr497, such as R498A and F500A, also responded to huIL-4 treatment with potent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 comparable with the levels seen in muIL-4-treated cells. However, cells expressing the P488A mutant showed greatly diminished tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 to levels that were <10% of the signal seen in WT-expressing cells in response to huIL-4 or of the signal elicited by the muIL-4 control. Proline residues can induce bends or kinks in protein structure, and Pro488 is just upstream to the hydrophobic residues shown to interact with residues found in a hydrophobic pocket of the PTB domain of IRS1 (19Zhou M.M. Huang B. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Shuker S.B. Miyazaki M. Trub T. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To determine whether Pro488might allow the downstream residues of the I4R motif to recruit and activate IRS2 in cells, we changed this residue to a glycine, an amino acid without a side chain, thus allowing protein flexibility. Cells expressing the P488G mutant demonstrated significant tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 in response to huIL-4, although slightly reduced compared with the response elicited by muIL-4, suggesting that Pro488 participates in IRS recruitment by regulating the availability of the downstream I4R motif residues to interact with the PTB domain. Interestingly, cells expressing huIL-4Rα with mutations in either of the hydrophobic residues shown to contact the PTB domain of IRS1, Leu498 or Ile491, demonstrated significant tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 in response to huIL-4, although the L498A-expressing cells showed a slightly diminished level (∼60% of signal elicited of endogenous muIL-4). However, cells expressing a construct with both Leu489 and Ile491 changed to Ala (L,I-A) showed greatly diminished tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 (<10% of WT) in response to huIL-4. These results suggest that these hydrophobic residues participate in the recruitment of IRS2, as shown in the solution structure analysis (19Zhou M.M. Huang B. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Shuker S.B. Miyazaki M. Trub T. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and that expression of either Leu489 or Ile491 alone is sufficient to activate the IRS2 pathway. We next examined the ability of huIL-4 to activate the STAT6 pathway and CD23 induction in M12.4.1 cells expressing the huIL-4Rα mutants (Figs. 3 and4). Treatment of cells expressing WT huIL-4Rα with human or mouse IL-4 induced a DNA binding activity specific for the Cε probe, indicating the activation of STAT6 (Fig. 3 A). The IL-4-induced complex can often be resolved into two bands, 2H. Wang, J. Zamorano, and A. D. Keegan, unpublished observations. where at other times the two bands are not distinguished. This DNA-binding complex was supershifted by anti-STAT6 antibody but not by anti-STAT3. Interestingly, when we analyzed the cells expressing the mutant constructs, we found that the pattern of responsiveness to huIL-4 was similar to the pattern we observed for IRS2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B); i.e. cells expressing the P488A mutant or the L,I-A mutant did not demonstrate STAT6 DNA binding activity in response to huIL-4, while they clearly responded to muIL-4. Cells expressing the P488G, L489A, I491A, and F500A mutants responded to huIL-4 by inducing STAT6 DNA binding activity. In keeping with these results, the pattern of CD23 induction in response to huIL-4 also corresponded to the pattern we observed for STAT6 DNA binding activity (Fig. 4). Treatment of cell lines expressing WT, P488G, L489A, I491A, R498A, and F500A with huIL-4 resulted in CD23 induction to levels seen in cells treated with the muIL-4 control. However, treatment of cells expressing P488A or L,I-A with huIL-4 did not result in the induction of CD23, while treatment with muIL-4 was able to induce its expression.Figure 4CD23 induction. M12.4.1 cells expressing the indicated mutations of the I4R motif were incubated with media (dotted line), 10 ng/ml muIL-4 (dashed line), or 10 ng/ml huIL-4 (solid line) for 48 h. CD23 expression was analyzed by FACS using fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-CD23.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These results indicate that residues within the I4R motif that are likely to be important for the interaction with PTB domains also participate in the regulation of the STAT6/gene induction pathway. It is possible that the I4R motif serves to regulate the activation of an additional signaling pathway, such as a serine kinase (34Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stahl N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6915-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 35Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), which would further modulate STAT6 DNA binding activity. On the other hand, the I4R motif could regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 itself. Therefore, we examined the ability of huIL-4 to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 (Figs.5 and 6). Again, the pattern of responsiveness to huIL-4 corresponded to the pattern we observed for STAT6 DNA binding activity. Treatment of cell lines expressing WT, P488G, L489A, I491A, R498A, and F500A with huIL-4 resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 to levels seen in cells treated with the muIL-4 control. However, treatment of cells expressing P488A or L,I-A with huIL-4 did not result in the induction of STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation, while treatment with muIL-4 was able to do so. To det"
https://openalex.org/W2094825892,"Transcription initiation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at most promoters is associated with a reiterative synthesis and release of short abortive RNA products. We have investigated the mechanism of abortive RNA synthesis by using holoenzymes containing mutant ς70 subunits with changes in region 3 (S506F and P504L), which reduce the ratio of abortive to full-length products. Binary complexes formed by these mutant enzymes at a modified λPR promoter contained a smaller fraction of open complexes than for normal polymerase, suggesting an involvement of region 3 in melting duplex DNA or in maintenance of the open complex. The half-lives of the majority of binary complexes formed by the mutant enzymes were less than 1 min, in contrast to 30 min for the wild-type complexes. The time courses of transcription and pulse-labeling assays showed that moribund complexes, which generate only abortive products (Kubori, T., and Shimamoto, N. (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 256, 449–457), were formed by the mutant enzymes. However, they accumulated to a lesser extent than for the wild-type enzyme, due both to faster dissociation and conversion into inactive complexes. This is the main cause of the low degree of abortive transcription displayed by the mutant enzymes on this promoter. Transcription initiation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at most promoters is associated with a reiterative synthesis and release of short abortive RNA products.

This is the main cause of the low degree of abortive transcription displayed by the mutant enzymes on this promoter. Abortive transcription by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase is characterized by reiterative synthesis and release of short transcripts of variable length in a template-dependent manner (1Johnston D.E.

Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). This nonproductive process occurs at most promoters, even in the presence of high concentrations of all four substrates (6Levin J.R. Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). During this process RNA polymerase does not usually dissociate from the template (7Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The RNA cleavage factors GreA and GreB have been found to reduce the production of abortive transcripts while concomitantly increasing that of full-length transcripts at some weak promoters (8Erie D.A. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 9Feng G. Lee D.N. Wang D. Chan C.L. Landick R. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 11588-11592Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that there could be a regulatory switch operating at this initiation step that affects the efficiency of productive elongation. The ς70 subunit is believed to be retained during abortive transcription, and the establishment of an elongation complex is correlated with release of ς subunit from the holoenzyme (11Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7829-7842Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 12Hansen H.M. McClure W.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1987; 193: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which suggests a possible involvement of this subunit in abortive synthesis. Two spontaneously generated missense alleles have been isolated, rpoD(P504L) and rpoD(S506F), whose mutations alter region 3 of the ς70 subunit and have been shown to compensate for the lack of ppGpp-dependent functions in a ppGpp0 strain (14Hernandez V.J. Cashel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 536-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is known that region 3 can be cross-linked to the catalytic center of the enzyme (15Severinov K. Fenyo D. Severinova E. Mustaev A. Chait B.T. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20826-20828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and becomes inaccessible from outside upon holoenzyme formation (16Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cells. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Holoenzymes with these mutant ς subunits also exhibit reduced abortive initiation at several phage promoters (17Hernandez V.J. Hsu L.M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18775-18779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus their study should shed light on the mechanism of abortive initiation and the involvement of region 3 of ς70 in this process. Recently Kubori and Shimamoto (18Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) demonstrated the existence of nonproductive complexes yielding only abortive products at modified λPR and lacUV5 promoters. These nonproductive complexes were termed “moribund complexes,” since they are incapable of productive elongation and gradually become fully inactive. Consistent with the inactivation, these promoters yield significantly fewer than one full-length transcript per promoter in a single-round transcription (19Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the reduced output of abortive transcripts at a modified λPR promoter (λPRAL) caused by the ς70 mutations P504L and S506F. The faster dissociation and concomitant lesser accumulation of moribund complexes were found to be the major causes of the low levels of abortive synthesis by these two mutant enzymes. Nucleoside triphosphates were obtained from Yamasa (Tokyo), and all radioisotopes were from NEN Life Science Products (Bethesda, MD). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Takara and Toyobo (Tokyo, Japan). Taq DNA polymerase was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All the linear DNA templates were prepared from parent plasmids by the polymerase chain reaction amplification method. The construction of these plasmids has been described elsewhere (19Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The templates carrying the λPR promoter have 32 (λPRAL32) or 73 bp 1The abbreviation used is: bp, base pair(s). (λPRAL73) A-less initial transcribed sequences, with total lengths of 190 and 230 bp, respectively. The transcription start site is situated 85 bp away from the upstream end of each DNA fragment. The original λPRpromoter partially overlaps the divergent λPRMpromoter in its upstream region. We inactivatedPRM by changing each of the bases −7A, −11T, and −12A into C (the positions are numbered with respect to the start site of PRM) to produce the modified promoter λPRAL. A 160-bp fragment harboring the T7A1 promoter (T7A1 DNA) was prepared as described previously (19Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The run-off transcript produced on this template was 74 nucleotides in length. All the polymerase chain reaction products were purified on 8% polyacrylamide gels and eluted. Immobilized template DNA was prepared as described previously (16Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cells. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The wild-type holoenzyme and core enzyme were purified according to Gonzalez et al. (20Gonzalez N. Wiggs J. Chamberlin M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 182: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) by using Biorex 70 (Bio-Rad) instead of phosphocellulose. Mutant ς factors were purified from overexpressing strains (17Hernandez V.J. Hsu L.M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18775-18779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) by the following modified procedure. After the ammonium sulfate fractionation, the samples were subjected successively to phenyl Toyopearl M, DEAE-Toyopearl M (TOSO; Tokyo, Japan) and phenyl-Superose HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column chromatography. The purity of the mutant ς factors was judged using a 7.5% polyacrylamide gels stained by the reverse staining method (21Ferrandez-Patron C. Calero M. Collazo P.R. Garcia J.R. Medrazo J. Mussachio A. Soriano F. Estrada R. Frank R. Castelleros-Serra L.R. Mendez E. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Holoenzyme was reconstituted by mixing core enzyme with a 1.5 molar excess of mutant ς subunit. We confirmed that this amount of mutant ς was optimal (data not shown) and that a further increase in the amount did not significantly change the activities (17Hernandez V.J. Hsu L.M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18775-18779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All the transcription assays were carried out as described previously (18Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in T buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml partially hydrolyzed casein) at 37 °C for 20 min. The concentration of the γ-32P-initiating nucleotide (GTP or ATP) was 5 μm, whereas the other nucleoside triphosphates were 0.1 mm. Unless otherwise indicated, 40 μg/ml heparin was added simultaneously with the substrates. For pulse-labeling experiments in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, the RNA polymerase-promoter binary complexes were formed in T buffer. NaCl was then added in both the unlabeled and labeled substrate solutions. The dissociation of the binary complexes was measured by trapping the dissociated enzyme with heparin (100 μg/ml) or with a 40-fold molar excess of T7A1 promoter-containing DNA (described in the text). Binary complexes were formed in T buffer containing 12% glycerol at 37 °C for 10 min. Samples were then loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 6.75 mmTris acetate, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. Electrophoresis was carried out for 1.5 h at a constant voltage of 150 V at room temperature in a circulating buffer system. Potassium permanganate footprinting was performed according to Suh et al. (22Suh W.C. Ross W. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1993; 259: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After the permanganate reaction, the samples were passed through Sephadex G-25 micro spin columns, treated with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and then precipitated with ethanol in the presence of sodium acetate and glycogen. DNA was cleaved by incubating the samples in 10% piperidine at 90 °C for 30 min, and the products were resolved on an 8% sequencing gel. We examined the effects of the mutations in region 3 of ς70 on the stability of the binary complex of RNA polymerase with the λPRAL promoter. First, a gel shift assay was employed in the absence of heparin to measure the apparent dissociation constants of complexes of the promoter with the wild-type and the two mutant holoenzymes. Essentially the same binding isotherm was observed for all three enzymes, so the mutations do not change the equilibrium constant for formation of the binary complex. The observed isotherm was sigmoidal, with a half-saturation around 20 nm (data not shown). This sigmoidal behavior is likely to be an artifact of the gel shift assay, because a single-round transcription assay using various concentrations of the wild-type enzyme yielded the usual hyperbola, with a half-saturation at 14 ± 3 nm (data not shown). Heparin traps free RNA polymerase and therefore can be used to measure the rate of dissociation of binary complexes (7Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We compared the heparin sensitivity of the binary complexes formed by the three enzymes. Complexes were formed by incubating the λPRAL32 DNA with a nearly saturating concentration of each enzyme at 37 °C for 10 min, which was sufficient for the binding to reach equilibrium. Incubation was continued for another 10 min in the presence of 100 μg/ml heparin, and the gel shift assay was then performed. Only 7 and 13% of the binary complexes formed by the S506F and P504L enzymes, respectively, resisted heparin, whereas 60% survived in the wild-type case (data not shown). This suggests that a smaller fraction of the mutant enzymes form heparin-resistant complexes such as the open complex and/or that reversion from open to closed complex is more rapid. Next we studied the dissociation kinetics of the binary complexes of wild-type and S506F enzymes with the λPRAL32 promoter. In these experiments, binary complexes were first formed with λPRAL32 at 37 °C, then further incubated for times ranging from 15 s to 20 min with either 100 μg/ml heparin or a 40-fold molar excess of T7A1 promoter as competitor. Finally, nucleotide substrates were added. The amounts of competitors used were enough to prevent the rebinding of the enzyme to λPRAL32. We compared the dissociation kinetics using two different competitors because it has been reported that heparin is not a simple competitor for some promoters (23Pfeffer S.R. Stahl S.J. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5403-5407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay measures the fraction of open complex that has survived in the presence of a competitor for each period of time. We monitored the formation of both the full-length (32-mer) and abortive (9-mer) products. Figs. 1, a and bshow the decay profiles for the two enzymes. The profile for the wild-type enzyme was almost monophasic, whereas that for the S506F mutant was biphasic and characterized by an early rapid decay. The kinetic parameters obtained are listed in Table I, proving that there is more than one type of binary complex of the S506F enzyme and that the major type is short-lived. Thus the back reaction into the free components is faster for the mutant enzyme, although the overall equilibrium constant of binary complex formation was not significantly different from wild type, as shown above by the gel shift assay in the absence of competitors.Table IThe values of the dissociation rate constants (k) for binary complexes of RNA polymerase carrying wild-type or S506F ς at the λPR AL32 promoterEnzymeCompetitork1k2min−1min−1Wild-typeT7A19-mer0.027 ± 0.00432-mer0.032 ± 0.004Wild-typeHeparin9-mer0.023 ± 0.00432-mer0.030 ± 0.004S506FT7A19-mer2.1 ± 0.30.09 ± 0.0132-mer1.6 ± 0.20.08 ± 0.01S506FHeparin9-mer1.8 ± 0.10.09 ± 0.0132-mer2.3 ± 0.20.08 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab Both heparin and T7A1 DNA exerted the same effect, within experimental error, as shown in Table I. Therefore in our system heparin acts as a simple competitor of the binary complexes by binding to free RNA polymerase. In the following sections all the interpretations of experiments using heparin assume this simple competition model. Permanganate preferentially modifies thymine residues in single-stranded or distorted regions of DNA in open promoter complexes (24Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of a saturating concentration of any of the enzymes, the thymine residues at −13, −10, −7, −4, −3, and +2 of the nontemplate strand and −8 and −9 of the template strand exhibited strongly increased permanganate sensitivity (Fig. 2). These residues were much more sensitive in the wild-type than in the mutant complexes, with S506F showing the least sensitivity. But the relative sensitivities of the residues in a given complex remained the same. These results suggest that smaller fractions of the binary complexes are in the “open” form in the case of the mutant enzymes, especially S506F. These mutations in region 3 of ς70, therefore, shift the equilibrium from the open toward the closed promoter state. This result is consistent with the presence of a large fraction of short-lived complexes among the binary complexes formed by the S506F mutant enzyme (Fig. 1); the major fraction of the mutant binary complexes is presumably in a closed state. The A-less template (λPRAL32) was designed so that by excluding ATP during transcription, a 32-mer paused product would be formed. Both the full-length (32-mer) and the shorter abortive products of this template can easily be quantified on the same polyacrylamide gel (18Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 5-mer and 9-mer transcripts were the major products observed along with the 32-mer using this template (Fig. 3 a). These short 5- and 9-mers were indeed abortive products, as shown in section “d.” The amounts of products formed in the presence or absence of heparin are quantified in Fig. 3, b and c. At a nearly saturating concentration of the enzyme (∼90% bound), both mutants produced less RNA than the wild-type enzyme (panel b). The amounts of abortive products (4–9-mer) were particularly reduced by the mutations, as is evident from the ratios of 5-mer to 32-mer transcripts (panel c). The 5-mer and 32-mer syntheses are, therefore, differentially inhibited by the mutations, suggesting the involvement of more than one pathway in the syntheses of these two products. Next we examined the time course of accumulation of the transcripts generated by both free and immobilized λPRAL32 templates in the presence of heparin. Templates that had been immobilized on avidin-acrylic beads were used to separate the released abortive products from those retained in the transcription complexes. After transcription with immobilized templates and brief centrifugation, the supernatant contained only released products. Fig. 4 a shows that most of the products shorter than 12 nucleotides were released and, thus, indeed products of abortive transcription. This was true not only for S506F but also for the other two enzymes (data not shown). Panels b and c are plots of the time courses of accumulation of the two major products (5-mer and 32-mer) using the free template with the wild-type and S506F enzymes, respectively. The production of the full-length 32-mer transcript had a time lag of about 48 s for the wild-type and P504L enzymes and about 18 s for S506F enzyme, respectively (panel c). 32-mer synthesis by all the enzymes reached a plateau at around 10 min (data for P504L are not shown). In the case of the wild-type enzyme, the time course of 5-mer production had an initial burst phase and a slow phase continuing beyond 20 min (panel b). The latter slow accumulation has been interpreted as evidence for the formation of moribund complexes, which are defined as complexes capable of persistent production only of abortive transcripts. However, the slow accumulation phase was not observed or barely detectable with the mutants, and both 5-mer and 32-mer production reached plateaus within 10 min (panel b). The analysis of time course data could be obscured if cleavage of transcripts were taking place. So we have used the pulse-labeling assay to confirm the difference between the temporal behaviors of abortive and full-length transcription. In this assay, transcription was first initiated with cold substrates, and then the γ-32P-labeled initiating nucleotide was added at various time points, followed by transcription for a further 5 min. This assay can detect the initiation of abortive products even after the synthesis of full-length transcripts has ceased. Such a persistent initiation of short transcripts is characteristic of moribund complexes at the λPRAL32 promoter (18Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The time course of synthesis of abortive products by the wild-type enzyme at the T7A1 promoter did not show any slow phase (data not shown). Therefore, moribund complexes (if any) do not accumulate at this promoter. To confirm the reliability of the pulse label assay, we used the T7A1 system as a control. As expected, incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP was rapid, and neither full-length nor abortive transcripts were labeled after 3 min (Fig. 5 a). With the λPRAL promoter, that the persistent initiation of 9-mer and 5-mer products after 32-mer initiation had ceased was observed in the case of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5 b) but was almost undetectable (Fig. 5 c) for S506F enzyme. Since most binary complexes of the mutant enzyme dissociate within 1 min and the released enzyme is trapped by heparin, the absence of persistent initiation might be an artifact caused by heparin, which was added with the substrates to prevent enzyme turnover. To avoid this potential artifact, we repeated the pulse-labeling experiments in the absence of heparin by using an alternative method to block turnover. λPRAL32 template was kept in 3-fold excess over enzyme, and the elongation complex was stalled at +32 by excluding ATP. In a control experiment, to confirm the absence of turnover in this protocol, we added a template harboring a 73-bp A-less leader sequence (AL73 template) plus labeled substrates to the pre-incubated mixture of λPRAL32 template, enzyme, and unlabeled substrates. We did not detect the 73-mer transcript, confirming that enzyme turnover had been blocked. The elimination of heparin did not significantly affect the persistent synthesis of abortive product by the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6 a, in the absence of heparin, S506F enzyme showed the persistent initiation of abortive transcripts. The ratios of abortive to full-length products increased with time for mutant enzyme (Fig. 6 b) as for the wild-type (Fig. 5 b and 6 d). Although the S506F enzyme produced much smaller amounts of 5-mer RNA than the wild-type, the accumulation of 9-mer was more comparable with that for wild-type enzyme. Therefore S506F enzyme does form moribund complexes at the λPR promoter, but the complexes are readily trapped by heparin after their rapid dissociation. The moribund complexes of the mutant are equilibrated with the free DNA and protein more rapidly than their wild-type counterparts, strongly suggesting the existence of binary complexes in moribund conformations. If the interpretation of the pulse-labeling results mentioned above is correct, any conditions preferentially destabilizing wild-type moribund complexes should mimic the effect of the S506F mutation when combined with heparin. We performed the same assay with the wild-type enzyme in the presence (only during the pulse period) of 100 mm extra NaCl, so that the resulting total salt concentration was 100 mm KCl and 100 mm NaCl. We chose this condition because it maintained the level of full-length transcription and the length distribution of abortive products from this promoter, which were altered at 200 mm KCl or by higher concentrations of NaCl (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6 c, the persistent production of abortive products was significantly reduced in this condition, and the ratios of abortive to productive transcripts remained constant after 3 min (Fig. 6 d). Therefore moribund complexes are salt-sensitive, indicating that ionic interactions play an important role in their stabilization. To understand the reasons for the reduced output of abortive transcripts by the ς70 mutants P504L and S506F (17Hernandez V.J. Hsu L.M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18775-18779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we examined the nature of the DNA-holoenzyme binary complexes, the abortive transcription process, and the accumulation of moribund complexes at the λPRAL promoter. In the open complex at the natural λPR promoter, about 14 bp of duplex DNA were melted in the −10 region (22Suh W.C. Ross W. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1993; 259: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that a ς70 fragment comprising amino acids 374–448, corresponding to a nearly complete region 2, can bind to the single-stranded form of the −10 region, specifically the nontemplate strand, with high affinity, and thereby stabilizes the melted duplex in this region (25Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that mutations in region 3 strongly affect the process of promoter melting or the stability of the open complex (Fig. 2) without changing the overall equilibrium constant of the binary complex formation. The predominant fraction of binary complexes of the mutants consists of a closed complex(es), which rapidly equilibrates with the free promoter and free holoenzyme. Open and closed binary complexes are, each, populations containing several different species (26Roe J.H. Burgess M.T. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 27Craig M.L. Suh W-C. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15624-15632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The rapid equilibrium of moribund complex with free mutant enzyme further suggests the existence of binary complexes with moribund conformation. Such binary complexes should be a component of the abortive cycle of moribund complexes, because the cycle involves interconversion between ternary and binary complexes. An accurate assignment of species to the two phases observed in the decay curve of the mutant (Fig. 1 b) is impossible. We conclude only that the mutation increases the rate of equilibration of open complex and moribund complex with their free components because both k1 and k2 for the mutant enzyme are larger than k1 of the wild-type (Table I). The lag time for productive transcription is reduced by the S506F mutation (Fig. 4 c). A similar acceleration by this mutation has also been observed at the galP2 promoter. 2V. J. Hernandez and M. Cashel, unpublished result. Therefore, a mutation in region 3 can accelerate the step(s) in the reaction pathway leading to productive transcription yet can simultaneously reduce the fraction of the open form in binary complexes and the overall yield of full-length product. At the λPRAL promoter, abortive transcripts are continuously produced for more than 20 min, whereas synthesis of full-length 32-mer ceases in 5 min (Ref. 18Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar; also in Fig. 5 b). Due to this long duration of abortive cycling compared with productive RNA synthesis, it is reasonable to suggest that a significant fraction of the abortive products generated from this promoter are made by moribund or nonproductive binary complexes. Here we report that mutations in the ς subunit or the addition of high salt not only reduce abortive transcription but also increase the rate of equilibration of moribund complexes with free enzyme. A rapid exchange of moribund complexes with free enzyme facilitates their conversion into other complexes, including open complexes, the inactivated ternary complexes (19Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and a complex with heparin (when it is added). These processes reduce the accumulation of moribund complexes and therefore reduce the output of abortive products. This appears to be the key reason for the observed decrease in abortive transcription by the ς mutants at this promoter. The existence of several alternative fates of mutant moribund complexes can also explain the absence of any concomitant increase in output of full-length products and the effects of heparin on full-length and abortive products. Recently, using DNA footprinting, it has been shown that moribund complexes are promoter-bound species (19Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is understandable that alteration of the RNA polymerase-promoter interaction by the mutations in the ς subunit (Figs. 1 and 2) should also influence the nature of the moribund complexes. As already mentioned, the reduction of abortive synthesis by a decreased accumulation of moribund complexes did not cause a concomitant increase in productive transcription. Similarly the presence of high salt, which selectively destabilized the moribund complexes, did not affect productive transcription (Fig. 6 c). This lack of correlation suggests that the abortive cycling associated with moribund complexes is not part of the sequential multistep initiation process leading to productive transcription. On the contrary, some moribund complexes convert into catalytically inactive complexes at this promoter (19Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although moribund complexes are very likely to be the major source of abortive products at this promoter, there is no evidence to prove or disprove the possibility that some abortive products arise from the productive pathway. Since very few, if any, moribund complexes appear to accumulate at the T7A1 promoter, it seems that their formation depends on the promoter sequence. Evidently some promoters, such as λPR, have a much greater tendency to form moribund complexes. It will be of great interest to evaluate how common is the formation of such complexes at promoters in general. Furthermore, structural characterization of moribund complexes will be essential for a full understanding of transcription initiation.

https://openalex.org/W2068576524,"The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene produces two mRNA species from tissue-specific promoters. The transcription start site of the mRNA for the smaller testicular isozyme (ACET) is located within an intron of the larger transcription unit that encodes the pulmonary isozyme (ACEP).We have previously demonstrated that a 298-base pair DNA fragment, 5′ to the rabbit ACET mRNA transcription initiation site, can activate the testicular expression of a transgenic reporter gene. In the current study, using the same transgenic reporter system, we identified a putative cyclic AMP response element present within this DNA fragment to be absolutely essential for transcriptional activation. Moreover, we observed that ACET mRNA was not expressed in the testes of mice homozygous for a null mutation in the transcription factor CREM. However, in the same mice, ACEP mRNA was abundantly expressed in the lung. Our observations indicate that ACET mRNA expression in the testes is regulated by the putative cyclic AMP response element present 5′ to the transcription start site and the corresponding transcription factor CREM."
https://openalex.org/W2027765483,"Abstract Stimulation of the phenotypically immature B cell lymphoma WEHI-231 with anti-IgM induces G1 arrest followed by apoptotic cell death, which can be reversed by stimulation via the CD40 receptor. Here, we show that cells expressing bcl-xL (WEHI-bcl-xL) arrest at G0/G1 following culture with anti-IgM but do not undergo apoptosis. These arrested cells can be induced to reenter the cell cycle by ligation of CD40. We have therefore used these cells as a model to study the regulation of the transcription factor E2F, which is critically involved in transit through the cell cycle. We found that anti-IgM treatment induces the appearance of an inhibitory DNA binding complex containing the pRB-related pocket protein p130 together with E2F and a concomitant decrease in “free” E2F, consisting of E2F1 and its partner DP1; these effects were reversed following stimulation via CD40. These changes in free E2F levels were regulated by changes in E2F1 gene transcription, which is at least partly a result of control of E2F1 promoter activity through its E2F binding sites. Transient transfection experiments showed that either E2F1 or the viral oncoprotein E1A, which sequesters pocket proteins, including p130, overcame anti-IgM-induced cell cycle arrest in WEHI-bcl-xL. Taken together, these results indicate that in WEHI-231 sIgM ligation induces the accumulation of hypophosphorylated p130 with consequent inhibition ofE2F1 gene transcription and cell cycle arrest. Conversely, ligation of CD40 causes hyperphosphorylation of p130, thereby releasing the repression of E2F1 and other E2F-regulated genes, enabling the cells to reenter the cycle. These results, therefore, provide novel insights into the mechanisms whereby antigen receptors on immature B cells deliver inhibitory signals (leading to negative selection of self-reactive B cells) and how these signals can be modulated by positive signals generated via CD40."

We are interested in how many classic cadherin molecules actually exist in humans and how these molecules function and cooperate in the development and maintenance of the integrity of the human body, as well as in various pathogenic states such as cancers. In an attempt to find novel human classic cadherin molecules that have not been identified by the aforementioned methods, we devised a new strategy based on the cadherin-catenin interaction. Our technique is a protein interaction cloning method using β-catenin, which binds directly to the cytoplasmic domains of classic cadherins (13Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). By using this method, we found two novel human classic cadherins, which we named cadherin-14 and -15. The former is a novel type II classic cadherin expressed widely in the central nervous system, and recently, we reported its cDNA cloning (39Shibata T. Shimoyama Y. Gotoh M. Hirohashi S. J. Biol.

However, this molecule has an additional peptide sequence at its C terminus not possessed by M-cadherin. In this report, we describe molecular cloning and functional and biochemical analyses of this human cadherin-15 molecule.DISCUSSIONMany molecules classified as cadherin superfamily members have been identified in the past few years. Full cDNA cloning of nine human classic cadherin molecules has been accomplished so far (3Tanihara H. Sano K. Heimark R.L. St. John T. Suzuki S. Cell Adhes.

Rep. 1993; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but exactly how many members belong to this family is unknown. We employed a novel cDNA cloning method based on the protein interaction between classic cadherins and β-catenin and identified two novel human classic cadherin molecules, cadherin-14 (39Shibata T. Shimoyama Y. Gotoh M. Hirohashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5236-5240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and cadherin-15, from a human adult brain cDNA library. Therefore, this method is considered useful for searching for new members of the classic cadherin family as well as for unknown molecules that associate with β-catenin, which is a multifunctional protein involved in both the cadherin cell adhesion and receptor-mediated intercellular signal transduction systems (56Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). We have tested this method on only one library, but it is possible that applying this method to other expression cDNA libraries derived from different sources will lead to the discovery of more novel molecules that interact with β-catenin.Our cDNA sequence analysis of cadherin-15 revealed that, of the known cadherins, cadherin-15 showed a very close resemblance to mouse M-cadherin, which was first identified in muscle cells and is considered to be involved in the fusion of myoblasts to myotubes (30Donalies M. Cramer M. Ringwald M. Starzinski-Powitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8024-8028Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Mouse M-cadherin has been reported to be expressed in skeletal muscle and cerebellum but not in cardiac or smooth muscle (30Donalies M. Cramer M. Ringwald M. Starzinski-Powitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8024-8028Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 57Pouliot Y. Gravel M. Holland P.C. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 200: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 58Rose O.

Starzinski-Powitz A. Franke W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6022-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), an expression pattern in complete agreement with that of cadherin-15 that we observed. These two findings suggest strongly that cadherin-15 is a human homologue of mouse M-cadherin. However, the two molecules differ markedly, cadherin-15 has a unique 31-amino acid sequence at its C terminus that has been found neither in mouse M-cadherin nor in the other known classic cadherins. Data base searches revealed no peptide sequences similar to this sequence, and what properties its addition confers on the function and molecular nature of cadherin-15 are unknown. The linkage with catenins and the cell-cell binding function of cadherin-15, at least, did not appear to be affected by this sequence, and no cytoplasmic components that interacted with cadherin-15 other than catenins were detected in repeated immunoprecipitation experiments. Molecular biological approaches, including site-directed mutagenesis, should clarify the significance of this sequence.The classic cadherins have been proposed to be divided into two subgroups, types I and II, on the basis of their overall sequence similarities and conservation of several motifs and aromatic amino acid residues in their extracellular domains (3Tanihara H. Sano K. Heimark R.L. St. John T. Suzuki S. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The human classic cadherins, E-, N-, and P-cadherin and cadherin-4, have been classified as type I and cadherin-6, -8, -11, -12, and -14 as type II. Although cadherin-5 was initially reported to be a type II cadherin (29Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), it was later found not to resemble the type II cadherins very closely (33Shimoyama Y. Gotoh M. Terasaki T. Kitajima M. Hirohashi S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2206-2211PubMed Google Scholar,39Shibata T. Shimoyama Y. Gotoh M. Hirohashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5236-5240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, it would appear that cadherin-5 cannot be classified as either type I or II. Cadherin-15 is more similar to type I than type II cadherins (Table I). However, it should be noted that there is an important difference between cadherin-15 and the other four type I cadherins. All the type I cadherins have the HAV tripeptide motif in EC1 which, together with its flanking amino acids, is intimately involved in the adhesive function and binding specificities of these cadherins (60Blaschuk O.W. Sullivan R. David S. Pouliot Y. Dev. Biol. 1990; 139: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 61Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 62Doherty P. Rowett L.H. Moore S.E. Mann D.A. Walsh F.S. Neuron. 1991; 6: 247-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) but has been replaced by the FAL tripeptide at amino acid position 123–125 in cadherin-15 (Fig. 1). Incidentally, the type II cadherins cadherin-6, -8, -11, -12, and -14 have QAI or QAD instead of the HAV motif, and cadherin-5 has VIV at the corresponding position. Cadherin-15 also exhibited a definitive biochemical difference from type I cadherins as follows: Ca2+ did not protect it against trypsin, suggesting the structures of the extracellular domains of cadherin-15 and type I cadherins differ. Similar trypsin sensitivity has been reported only for cadherin-5 (63Tanihara H. Kido M. Obata S. Heimark R.L. Davidson M. St John T. Suzuki S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the LDRE motif found in EC4 of the other human classic cadherins has been replaced by LSPA in cadherin-15. Therefore, we propose that cadherin-15 and cadherin-5 cannot be classified as either type I or II cadherins.As there is no appropriate method for quantifying cadherins at present, the binding strength of each cadherin subclass cannot be evaluated precisely. In a cDNA transfection system using L fibroblasts, which lack cadherin activity and express very little catenin at the protein level but large amounts at the RNA level, ectopic cadherin expression induces accumulation of catenin proteins, probably because they are stabilized by association with cadherins. In this study, we paid particular attention to the expression level of β-catenin protein, which associates directly with the cytoplasmic domain of classic cadherins (13Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 38Peifer M. McCrea P.D. Green K.J. Wieschaus E. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), in transfectants. Assuming that any classic cadherin subclass influences the preservation of β-catenin protein in L cells similarly, the binding strength of each cadherin subclass can be compared using transfectants that express equal amounts of β-catenin protein. Therefore, we compared the aggregation of a cadherin-15 transfectant with that of an E-cadherin transfectant expressing almost the same amounts of β-catenin protein. The sizes and cell-cell adhesiveness of the aggregates were indistinguishable. On the assumption stated above, it is conceivable that the cell-cell binding strengths of cadherin-15 and E-cadherin are virtually equivalent. Finally, our mixed cell aggregation assays showed that cadherin-15 mediates cell-cell adhesion in a homophilic manner and exhibits cell-cell binding specificity, i.e. it did not interact with the molecules expressed on L cells, mouse E-cadherin, human P-cadherin, cadherin-6, or cadherin-14.In conclusion, we have isolated a full-length human cadherin-15 cDNA using a novel cDNA cloning method and characterized the cadherin-15 molecule using an L fibroblast cDNA transfection system. We hope that the technique we have developed and results of this study will be useful for further investigations into cell-cell interactions.

This superfamily includes the classic cadherins (1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin.

Each classic cadherin comprises a signal sequence and a precursor region, which are both cleaved by intracellular proteolytic processing, five cadherin extracellular subdomain repeats, a transmembrane domain and a characteristic cytoplasmic domain, which is highly conserved among the subclasses and is indispensable for association with catenins, the ensuing linkage to the cytoskeleton and full functioning as a Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule (13Ozawa M.

We employed a novel cDNA cloning method based on the protein interaction between classic cadherins and β-catenin and identified two novel human classic cadherin molecules, cadherin-14 (39Shibata T. Shimoyama Y. Gotoh M. Hirohashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5236-5240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and cadherin-15, from a human adult brain cDNA library. Therefore, this method is considered useful for searching for new members of the classic cadherin family as well as for unknown molecules that associate with β-catenin, which is a multifunctional protein involved in both the cadherin cell adhesion and receptor-mediated intercellular signal transduction systems (56Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). We have tested this method on only one library, but it is possible that applying this method to other expression cDNA libraries derived from different sources will lead to the discovery of more novel molecules that interact with β-catenin.Our cDNA sequence analysis of cadherin-15 revealed that, of the known cadherins, cadherin-15 showed a very close resemblance to mouse M-cadherin, which was first identified in muscle cells and is considered to be involved in the fusion of myoblasts to myotubes (30Donalies M. Cramer M. Ringwald M. Starzinski-Powitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8024-8028Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Mouse M-cadherin has been reported to be expressed in skeletal muscle and cerebellum but not in cardiac or smooth muscle (30Donalies M. Cramer M. Ringwald M. Starzinski-Powitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

These two findings suggest strongly that cadherin-15 is a human homologue of mouse M-cadherin. However, the two molecules differ markedly, cadherin-15 has a unique 31-amino acid sequence at its C terminus that has been found neither in mouse M-cadherin nor in the other known classic cadherins. Data base searches revealed no peptide sequences similar to this sequence, and what properties its addition confers on the function and molecular nature of cadherin-15 are unknown. The linkage with catenins and the cell-cell binding function of cadherin-15, at least, did not appear to be affected by this sequence, and no cytoplasmic components that interacted with cadherin-15 other than catenins were detected in repeated immunoprecipitation experiments. Molecular biological approaches, including site-directed mutagenesis, should clarify the significance of this sequence.The classic cadherins have been proposed to be divided into two subgroups, types I and II, on the basis of their overall sequence similarities and conservation of several motifs and aromatic amino acid residues in their extracellular domains (3Tanihara H. Sano K. Heimark R.L. St. John T. Suzuki S. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The human classic cadherins, E-, N-, and P-cadherin and cadherin-4, have been classified as type I and cadherin-6, -8, -11, -12, and -14 as type II. Although cadherin-5 was initially reported to be a type II cadherin (29Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), it was later found not to resemble the type II cadherins very closely (33Shimoyama Y. Gotoh M. Terasaki T. Kitajima M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5236-5240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, it would appear that cadherin-5 cannot be classified as either type I or II. Cadherin-15 is more similar to type I than type II cadherins (Table I). However, it should be noted that there is an important difference between cadherin-15 and the other four type I cadherins. All the type I cadherins have the HAV tripeptide motif in EC1 which, together with its flanking amino acids, is intimately involved in the adhesive function and binding specificities of these cadherins (60Blaschuk O.W. Sullivan R. David S. Pouliot Y. Dev. Biol. 1990; 139: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 61Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M.

Incidentally, the type II cadherins cadherin-6, -8, -11, -12, and -14 have QAI or QAD instead of the HAV motif, and cadherin-5 has VIV at the corresponding position. Cadherin-15 also exhibited a definitive biochemical difference from type I cadherins as follows: Ca2+ did not protect it against trypsin, suggesting the structures of the extracellular domains of cadherin-15 and type I cadherins differ. Similar trypsin sensitivity has been reported only for cadherin-5 (63Tanihara H. Kido M. Obata S. Heimark R.L. Davidson M. St John T. Suzuki S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the LDRE motif found in EC4 of the other human classic cadherins has been replaced by LSPA in cadherin-15. Therefore, we propose that cadherin-15 and cadherin-5 cannot be classified as either type I or II cadherins.As there is no appropriate method for quantifying cadherins at present, the binding strength of each cadherin subclass cannot be evaluated precisely. In a cDNA transfection system using L fibroblasts, which lack cadherin activity and express very little catenin at the protein level but large amounts at the RNA level, ectopic cadherin expression induces accumulation of catenin proteins, probably because they are stabilized by association with cadherins. In this study, we paid particular attention to the expression level of β-catenin protein, which associates directly with the cytoplasmic domain of classic cadherins (13Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 38Peifer M. McCrea P.D. Green K.J. Wieschaus E. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), in transfectants. Assuming that any classic cadherin subclass influences the preservation of β-catenin protein in L cells similarly, the binding strength of each cadherin subclass can be compared using transfectants that express equal amounts of β-catenin protein. Therefore, we compared the aggregation of a cadherin-15 transfectant with that of an E-cadherin transfectant expressing almost the same amounts of β-catenin protein. The sizes and cell-cell adhesiveness of the aggregates were indistinguishable. On the assumption stated above, it is conceivable that the cell-cell binding strengths of cadherin-15 and E-cadherin are virtually equivalent. Finally, our mixed cell aggregation assays showed that cadherin-15 mediates cell-cell adhesion in a homophilic manner and exhibits cell-cell binding specificity, i.e. it did not interact with the molecules expressed on L cells, mouse E-cadherin, human P-cadherin, cadherin-6, or cadherin-14.In conclusion, we have isolated a full-length human cadherin-15 cDNA using a novel cDNA cloning method and characterized the cadherin-15 molecule using an L fibroblast cDNA transfection system. We hope that the technique we have developed and results of this study will be useful for further investigations into cell-cell interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2020466480,"The metabolic fate of covalently linked DNA-protein complexes (cross-links) is not clearly understood. Our aim was to investigate the processing of protein-DNA cross-links by cellular enzymes. As an example of a DNA-protein cross-link, we have constructed frozen topoisomerase-DNA conjugates and investigated their processing by human cell-free extracts. A suicide DNA substrate was constructed that upon reaction with vaccinia type I topoisomerase yielded a highly stable covalent DNA-protein cross-link. When this conjugate was treated with human nuclear or whole cell extracts, two sites of DNA breakpoints were detected: one set of double-stranded breaks occurred close to the 3′ side of the topoisomerase (topo) conjugation site, and there was another set of nicks about 30 nucleotides 3′ to the topo site. The double-stranded breaks were not made by extracts from xeroderma pigmentosum group A mutant cells, suggesting that the xeroderma pigmentosum group A damage recognition protein may be required for the occurrence of DNA breakage. In addition to these DNA breakage reactions, there was an activity that resulted in the delinking of the frozen topoisomerase (or proteolytic fragments thereof) from the DNA substrate, which was followed by a ligation step that restored the continuity of the broken DNA strand at the erstwhile topo attachment site. We suggest that frozen topoisomerase-DNA conjugates (and perhaps other types of covalent DNA-protein complexes) are processed by multiple pathways that may involve the cleavage of the DNA in the covalent protein-DNA complex and/or enzymatic delinking followed by ligation of the broken DNA ends. These processes may represent the “repair” of DNA-protein cross-links. The metabolic fate of covalently linked DNA-protein complexes (cross-links) is not clearly understood.

These processes may represent the “repair” of DNA-protein cross-links. Clear-cut evidence for the occurrence or the repair of DNA-protein cross-links in normal living cells is lacking. Nevertheless, there are compelling reasons to believe that the protein-DNA cross-link is a distinct category in the repertoire of DNA damage in living cells (1Bernstein C. Bernstein H. Aging, Sex and DNA Repair. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 19Google Scholar). Protein-DNA cross-links can occur via a variety of processes. Extraneous agents such as UV (2Shetlar M.D. Smith K.C. Photochemical and Photobiological Reviews. 5. Plenum Press, New York1981: 105-197Google Scholar) or therapeutic chemicals (e.g. cisplatin, furocoumarins, and anticancer topoisomerase poisons) (3Kane S.A. Lippard S.J.

Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) are known to induce DNA-protein cross-links. Proteins contain reactive functional groups (NH2, COO−, thiols, aromatics, and heterocyclics), which may react with the other functional groups in DNA bases (7Wong S.S. Chemistry of Protein Conjugation and Cross-linking. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 7-45Google Scholar). In DNA, the 5,6 double bond of pyrimidines is highly photoreactive (8Ruzsicska B.P. Lemaire D.G.E. Horspool W.M. Song P.-S. CRC Handbook of Organic Photochemistry and Photobiology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1289-1317Google Scholar). The cell is rich in photosensitizers, such as porphyrins, cyanins, quinones, flavins, and NADPH, which may act as UV-excitable photosensitizers that in turn may react with protein functional groups via type I or type II mechanisms (9Foote C.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 659Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 10Vidoczy T. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1992; 14: 139-150Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Excited photosensitizers intercalated into DNA may react with bound proteins to form ternary photoconjugates (4Sastry S.S. Spielmann H.P. Hoang Q.S. Phillips A.M. Sancar A. Hearst J.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5526-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 5Sastry S.S. Ross B.M. P'arraga A. J. Biol.

The intracellular milieu itself favors DNA-protein cross-linking. Eucaryotic nuclear DNA is compacted >50,000-fold into chromatin, and the DNA is always tightly associated with histones, high mobility group proteins, transcription factors, polymerases, recombinases and repair enzymes, which have typical macroscopic association constants in the order of 1013–107m−1. The stability time scales for protein-DNA interactions range from several seconds to hours (12Careri G. Fasella P. Gratton E. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 3: 141-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Many DNA-binding proteins that participate in recombination and replication form transient covalent DNA-protein conjugates. Notable examples of this category are topoisomerases, integrases, and replication initiator proteins (13Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. Ed. 2. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco1992: 353Google Scholar). Topoisomerase poisons can convert transient topo 1The abbreviations used are: topo, topoisomerase; ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; nt, nucleotide(s); TE, Tris-EDTA; TBE, Tris-borate-EDTA; XPA, xeroderma pigmentosum group A; DTT, dithiothreitol. 1The abbreviations used are: topo, topoisomerase; ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; nt, nucleotide(s); TE, Tris-EDTA; TBE, Tris-borate-EDTA; XPA, xeroderma pigmentosum group A; DTT, dithiothreitol.-DNA complexes into highly stable frozen conjugates (6Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Deleterious consequences can occur if proteins covalently bound to DNA are not removed. There may be arrest or premature termination of DNA replication and/or transcription, which may result in chromosome instability and cell death. Considering the above facts, we supposed that enzymatic mechanisms capable of “repairing” protein-DNA cross-links should exist in living cells. To discover such activities, we are designing and developing covalently conjugated DNA-protein substrates. Here, we have constructed a vaccinia topoisomerase I-DNA conjugate that represents a well-defined paradigm for a DNA-protein cross-link. We used this conjugate to test for activities in human cell-free extracts that might be involved in putative repair pathways. We found that the DNA in the cross-link was ruptured at specific sites by enzymatic activities in the cell-free extracts. The frozen topoisomerase was removed from its DNA attachment site, and the continuity of the DNA strand appeared to be restored by a ligation step. We propose that these reactions are steps in the pathways for the repair of frozen DNA-topo conjugates, and perhaps for other types of DNA-protein cross-links. DNA oligos were purchased from Midland Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). The concentration of DNAs were determined from UV absorbance at 260 nm (ε260∼104m−1 cm−1/nt). DNAs were either 5′-end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP or 3′-end labeled with [α-32P]dideoxy-ATP and calf terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1982; (and 438–475, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 107-148Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled and unlabeled DNAs were run on preparative 8 m urea-polyacrylamide gels, and the correct full-length DNAs were recovered by electroelution. Equimolar amounts (1 μm) each of 58-mer, 94-mer, and 150-mer were mixed in kinase buffer (Tris-Mg buffer from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA)), extracted with phenol-chloroform, and precipitated with EtOH (14Maniatis T.

The DNAs were taken up in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2/water, heated at 65 °C for 2–5 min, and cooled to room temperature over a period of 3–4 h. Purified vaccinia topo I (fraction III9) was supplied by Drs. JoAnn Sekiguchi and Stewart Shuman of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY). The stock topo I was at a concentration of 2.6 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.6–0.8 m NaCl. Twenty-five μl aliquots of frozen topo I were stored at −70 °C. Two freeze-thaw cycles did not affect its binding and covalent complex formation with DNA. HeLaS2 nuclear extract was prepared and assayed for transcriptional activity by Dr. Camilo Parada (in Dr. Robert Roeder's laboratory at Rockefeller University) using the Dignam procedure (15Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were at ∼10 mg of protein/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm KCl. HeLaS2 cells were obtained from Dr. Robert Roeder's laboratory, and the human XPA mutant cell line (XP208, Japanese, complementation group A-278700) was a gift of Dr. Peter Glazer (Yale University). Whole cell extracts were prepared using the Manley method (16Manley J.L. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 17Reardon J.T. Speilmann P. Huang J.C. Sastry S.S. Sancar A. Hearst J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4623-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and stored in 25 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 16% glycerol at 15 mg of protein/ml. Extracts were frozen in 10–20-μl aliquots at −70 °C. Frozen extracts were stable for several months, and the aliquots were not used after two freeze-thaw cycles. All experiments were carried out with the same batches of extracts. Our assay procedure was designed after a DNA repair assay that was originally developed in Dr. Aziz Sancar's laboratory (17Reardon J.T. Speilmann P. Huang J.C. Sastry S.S. Sancar A. Hearst J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4623-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The details of the procedure were kindly supplied by Drs. J. Reardon and Aziz Sancar. First, ice-cold master mixture (usually 110 μl) was prepared. This consisted of 2 mmATP, 20 μm dNTPs, 200 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 100 ng of pUC plasmid DNA, buffer (30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 3.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA), Tris salts (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA), 32P-DNA suicide substrate (final amount, 0.1 pmol; or with topo at 2–4-fold molar excess), 20 μl of H2O per reaction (all are final concentrations). The cell-free extracts were quickly thawed, and different amounts were aliquotted into ice-cold Eppendorf tubes. The master mixture (20 μl per reaction) was added to the extract, mixed quickly, and kept at 30 °C for 1–3 h. Then, SDS (final concentration, 1%), 22 μl of water, and proteinase K (final concentration, 20 mg/ml) were added, and the tubes were kept at 37 °C for 15 min. Finally, 150 μl of water was added, and the DNA was extracted with a mixture of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with EtOH (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1982; (and 438–475, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 107-148Google Scholar). The DNA was redissolved in 12 μl of 8m urea-TBE dyes and run on 15% acrylamide-8 murea-Tris borate-EDTA gels. The DNA bands were visualized by autoradiography with x-ray films and/or a phosphor screen. The ds 150-mer suicide DNA substrates were constructed with the 32P-label on the 5′-end of either the 58-mer or the 94-mer. The DNA substrates were run on a preparative nondenaturing 8% acrylamide gel (12 cm long × 16 cm wide) in Tris borate-EDTA buffer (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1982; (and 438–475, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 107-148Google Scholar) and the radiolabeled 150-mer ds DNA bands were identified by autoradiography of the wet gel. The appropriate bands containing the DNAs were excised from the gel, and the DNA was recovered by electroelution followed by extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol and precipitated with EtOH (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1982; (and 438–475, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 107-148Google Scholar). Topoisomerase-DNA complexes were prepared by mixing vaccinia topo (0.6 pmol) with the purified ds 150-mer 32P-DNAs (0.3 pmol) in 15 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Two to 5 μl of the topo-DNA complexes were then added to ice-cold Eppendorf tubes containing 2–5 μl of whole cell extract in a master mix (see above) or a compensating volume of only the master mix without the extract. The final volume was 25 μl per reaction. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for various lengths of time (see legend in Fig. 7). The reactions were then made either 5% glycerol or 5% glycerol plus 1% SDS (without the tracking dyes) and were loaded in nondenaturing 5% acrylamide gels (12 cm long × 16 cm wide) that were prepared and run in Tris borate-EDTA buffer (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1982; (and 438–475, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 107-148Google Scholar). The gels were electrophoresed at 60 V until the bromphenol dye (loaded in a gel well away from the experimental samples) was 3–4 cm from the bottom of the gel. The gels were then fixed in 5% acetic acid, 3% glycerol, 5% methanol for 30–40 min and dried. The DNA bands were visualized by autoradiography with an x-ray film. In cases where the DNAs or the DNA-protein complexes were to be recovered from native gels, the gel-fixing step was omitted and the wet gels were directly autoradiographed. Gel pieces containing the DNA bands of interest were excised from the gel and were soaked in 0.5 ml of TE buffer (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1982; (and 438–475, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 107-148Google Scholar), 0.3% SDS, 1 mg of proteinase K per ml for 2 h at 37 °C. The gel pieces along with the solution were transferred in to the cell of an electroelution (ELUTRAP™) device (Schleicher & Schuell). The DNA was electroeluted and recovered after extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol and precipitation with EtOH (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1982; (and 438–475, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 107-148Google Scholar). Each of the DNA samples was resuspended in 15 μl of TBE buffer containing 8 m urea, tracking dyes and heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min and analyzed on thin 15% acrylamide-8 m urea-TBE denaturing gels. The DNA bands were visualized by autoradiography. The monomeric (molecular mass, 36.6 kDa) type I topoisomerase of the vaccinia virus specifically binds and cleaves the conserved sequence 5′-(C/T)CCTT↓ in duplex DNA (18Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11372-11379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During a single catalytic cycle, the enzyme cleaves only the top strand (the scissile strand) and forms a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate (Fig. 1). Religation of the broken DNA bond occurs following strand passage/rotation. The covalent intermediate has a 3′-phosphodiester linkage with Tyr-274 (19Shuman S. Kane E.M. Morham S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9793-9797Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Shuman S. Prescott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17826-17836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our DNA substrate consisted of a 32P-58-mer, which ended in CCCTTAT-3′ (the cleaved strand) plus a cold 5′ phosphorylated 94-mer top strand and an unlabeled 150-mer bottom strand (Fig. 1). In this DNA substrate, there is only a single high-affinity consensus topo site (CCCTT). Topo cleavage is highly specific at this site; even single base substitutions in the consensus site reduce DNA cleavage quite drastically (21Shuman S. Turner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18943-18950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate the formation of a stable covalent frozen intermediate, we titrated a fixed amount of32P-58-mer DNA “suicide” substrate with different amounts of topo I. The reactions were then stopped by adding 1% SDS, which denatured the topo. The samples were electrophoresed through 6% acrylamide-SDS gels. In these assays, we used two variations of the suicide substrate. In the first type of substrate, the32P-58-mer cleavable strand was annealed to the unlabeled 150-mer bottom strand (i.e. the 94-mer was not included; Fig. 1 B without the 94-mer). This resulted in a partially duplex structure with the topo cleavable site in the ds region. In the second case, all the three oligos (32P-58-, 94-, and 150-mer; Fig. 1 A), were annealed to create a fully ds substrate shown in Fig. 1 B. In the first substrate, topo I cleaves off the 3′ overhanging terminal AT flap of the32P-58-mer resulting in a frozen SDS-resistant32P-56-mer-topo I conjugate (Fig. 2 A). Because the 94-mer is absent, ligation is prevented and the complex remains frozen. In the second substrate, the frozen 32P-56-mer-topo I conjugate remains so in the presence of SDS because the 5′-end of the 94-mer was phosphorylated (Fig. 2 B). The reason for testing both substrates is that the substrate without the 94-mer served as an “authentic control” suicide substrate because similar forms have often been used in topo binding assays (see, for example, Ref. 22Petersen B.O. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, we can estimate the amount of frozen complex formed on the fully ds substrate relative to the authentic control. With the partially ds substrate a single complex representing the trapped topo-DNA conjugate was seen (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–6). Based on the relative phosphor counts in the free DNA versus cross-linked DNA, we estimated that on the average about 85–90% of the 32P-DNA was conjugated to the topo. A 2–4 fold molar excess of topo I was sufficient to produce the maximum amount of frozen conjugate. Similarly, when the fully ds substrate, which contained the cold phosphorylated 94-mer was used, up to 90% of the32P-56-mer DNA was conjugated to the topo (Fig. 2 B). The presence of excess topo did not change the amount of frozen complex formed. These experiments demonstrate that SDS-resistant stable topo-DNA complexes were consistently formed on the ds 150-mer suicide substrate. A small amount of free DNA was always seen whether the phosphorylated 94-mer was present or not. This may be simply because the conjugation reaction is never 100% efficient (just like almost all in vitro enzymatic reactions), or it may be because a small fraction of the DNA molecules were, for some reason, not “liked” by the topo I. We do not believe that the probable presence of a small fraction (10–15% or less) of free DNA in the reactions would affect the interpretation of our subsequent experimental results because a major fraction of the DNA is always covalently bound to the topo I. Any free topo is unlikely to have interacted with other sites on the DNA because we have not observed multiple complexes in SDS gels and the cleavage by topo is highly specific. Addition of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase Klenow fragment (plus all four cold dNTPs) to the frozen topo-DNA conjugates did not result in extension of the 5′ 32P-labeled 56-mer, indicating that the 3′-end of the 56-mer was inaccessible to Klenow because it is conjugated to the topo (not shown). We have performed additional control experiments to assess the binding of topo I to a nonsuicide substrate (i.e. continuous top strand plus bottom strand or with a nonphosphorylated 94-mer) relative to the suicide substrate. In this nonsuicide substrate the topo I recognition site was the same as that shown in Fig. 1. Using our gel assay, we observed only a very faint band that represented an equilibrium complex on the nonsuicide DNA substrate. The amount of SDS-resistant topo-DNA complex that was formed on nonsuicide substrate was only about 10% compared with that formed on the suicide substrate. When human cell-free extracts are added to topo-DNA conjugates, super-shifted bands were seen (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7 and 8). These SDS-resistant complexes may represent higher-order complexes between topo-DNA conjugates and some factor(s) in the whole cell extracts. In the absence of the topo there were no SDS-resistant shifted bands with cell-free extracts alone (Fig. 2 C, lane 4). Addition of extract, first, to the DNA and then the addition of topo dramatically reduced complex formation, suggesting that preformed topo-DNA complexes were required for the formation of higher-order complexes (Fig. 2 C, lanes 2 and 3). These experiments demonstrated that human whole cell extracts contained factors that tightly bind frozen topo I-DNA conjugates. Initially, to assay the fate of frozen topo-DNA cross-links, we attempted to work with purified topo-DNA conjugates (i.e. without any free DNA), which were obtained either by excising the DNA bands representing the conjugates in native gels and subsequently electroeluting the complexes, or by purifying topo-DNA reactions through a high performance liquid chromatography gel-filtration column. With the former procedure, we could recover only about 5–10% of the topo-DNA conjugates even after prolonged (24 h) electroelution. Hence, this procedure was abandoned because it was extremely inefficient. The high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration procedure was somewhat more efficient for separating free DNA from topo-DNA conjugates (data not shown). However, with both procedures, the quality of the recovered topo-DNA conjugates, as assessed from the UV absorption spectra, was uncertain. The isolated topo-DNA conjugates did not show the expected dominant broad transition at λmax at 260 nm, which is a signature of nondenatured native DNA-protein conjugates because the stronger nucleic acid base transitions (centered at 260 nm) dominate those from aromatic (e.g. Trp and Tyr) residues of the protein. We concluded that the isolation and purification of native topo-DNA conjugates was fraught with difficulties and that the isolated conjugates may not represent native states. Hence, we decided to carry out the following experiments with topo-DNA conjugates without further purification. We incubated topo-DNA conjugates that were formed on the suicide substrate with human nuclear or whole cell-free extracts. The extracts were prepared by published procedures (see “Materials and Methods”). The biochemical competence of these extracts was ascertained by performing a transcription assay driven by the adenovirus major late promoter (assay was carried out in Prof. Robert Roeder's laboratory at Rockefeller University). When increasing amounts of human nuclear extract were incubated with preformed topo I-DNA conjugates followed by digestion with proteinase K, a new band(s) migrating at ∼88 nt was seen (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–8, arrow). This band suggested breakage of the topo-conjugated DNA substrate (see below for more details). In the presence of topo I without the extract (following treatment with proteinase K) or in the absence of topo I with extract (following treatment with proteinase K), no such bands were observed. This indicated that cleavage occurred only in the presence of the extract and topo I (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–8). These results were replicated several times. A full-length top strand32P-150-mer (Fig. 3, arrowhead) was generated whether topo I was present or not. The diamond symbol (Figs.3 and 4) denotes slightly retarded bands running just above the 56-mer (Fig. 3 B, asterisk). These bands may have originated from the 32P-56-mers that were covalently linked to very short peptides that were proteinase K-resistant.Figure 4Topo-DNA complexes were treated with whole cell extracts. Note that only the 58-mer was 32P labeled in this assay (asterisk). Panel A: lane 1contained DNA-topo complexes without the extract that were treated with proteinase K; lanes 2–8 contained DNA that was treated with 0.5 μl of a 10× dilution of extract and with 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 15 μl of extract, respectively. Panel B, lane 1 contained topo-DNA complexes that were not treated with proteinase K; lanes 2–8 are DNA-topo complexes were treated with 0.5 μl of a 10× dilution of extract and with 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 15 μl of whole cell extract, respectively. The other lanes contained ss DNA markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 4 B (lanes 3–7) shows that whole cell extracts generated the ∼88-mer, just as the nuclear extracts did, probably indicating that the cleavage activities resided in the nucleus. We do not know why the highest amount of extract tested inhibited the production of the approximately 32P-88-mer (Fig. 4 B, lane 8). It is possible that the cleavage activity aggregated and fell out of solution or there was an excess amount of inhibitor(s) at the highest amount of extract; alternatively, the DNA may have been sequestered by nonspecific DNA-binding proteins in the extract. To define the sites of the DNA breakage, we 32P-labeled the ds suicide substrate on either the 94-mer or the 150-mer (Fig. 1). Our attempts to assay for cleavage of the 5′-end labeled 150-mer bottom strand were frustrated because the nuclear and/or the whole cell extract contained a strong phosphatase that for unknown reasons specifically dephosphorylated the 5′-32P-end of the bottom strand (Fig. 3, C and D in Fig. 3). To circumvent this problem, we32P-labeled the 3′-end of the 150-mer bottom strand using [α-32P]dideoxy-ATP and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the cleavage of the bottom strand generated a cluster of bands that were predominantly centered at ∼62 nt (Figs. 5 A, 6 II 150B-C, and 5 D). This indicated that the bottom strand, which is complementary to the topo-conjugated strand (i.e.the scissile top strand), is also cleaved (Fig. 5 D). (Note that the topo I itself does not cleave the bottom strand.) When the 94-mer was 32P labeled, fragments measuring ∼65 nt from the 3′-end (Figs. 5 B and 6, 94-C) or ∼32 nt from the 5′-end were seen (Fig. 5 C). The ∼65 nt and the ∼32 nt fragments represented cleavage of the suicide substrate 3′ to the topo site (Fig. 5 D). When cell-free extract was added to a mixture of non-suicide DNA plus topo I, we did not observe specific cuts in the DNA (not shown). This experiment indicated that the presence of frozen topo-DNA conjugates was necessary for DNA cleavage.Figure 6Isolation and sequencing of the breakage products.

Berzofsky J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 923-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because the pathology associated with HIV infection is not fully understood, there are concerns that vaccines made from attenuated strains of HIV could be unsafe, whereas subunit vaccines might not be complex enough to generate an appropriate immune response. Further, it is unlikely that immunity produced against one strain of HIV-1 will be effective in providing large scale protection against such a mutable virus. Studies of infected individuals termed nonprogressors have indicated that a combined response of neutralizing antibody and reactive cytotoxic T-cells can retard the onset of AIDS (2Pantaleo G.

Therefore, the development of a stable vaccine, which could elicit both humoral and cellular responses and be flexible enough to incorporate sequences from many HIV-1 strains, is desirable.

Further, immunization with a recombinant form of gp120 appears sufficient to protect chimpanzees from infection by HIV-1 challenge (15Berman P.W. Gregory T.J. Riddle L. Nakamura G.R.

Thus, gp120 and its parent molecule, gp160, have been used to vaccinate human volunteers (16Kovacs J.A. Vasudevachari M.B. Easter M. Davey R.T. Falloon J. Polis M.A. Metcalf J.A. Salzman N.

Because of the importance of the envelope protein and specifically its V3 loop for HIV infectivity, our efforts have focused on the development of chimeras composed of strain-specific V3 loop sequences. PE has a nonessential subdomain, termed Ib, which is composed of a small loop flanked by a disulfide bond. Chimeras were designed to introduce V3 loop amino acids in this location where they could form a loop and be exposed at the surface of the protein. Although V3 loops vary considerably among the various HIV-1 strains (18White-Scharf M.E. Potts B.J. Smith L.M. Sokolowski K.A. Rusche J.R. Silver S. Virology. 1993; 192: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), specific antibodies to this region have been shown to neutralize infectivity of the virus and to prevent viral cell fusion in vitro (6Ahlers J.D. Pendleton C.D. Dunlop N. Minassian A. Nara P.L. Berzofsky J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5647-5665PubMed Google Scholar). Because our vector allows for the introduction of many different sequences, we anticipate that a chimera displaying the V3 loop of any isolate could be produced. PE is secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a 67-kDa protein composed of three prominent globular domains (Ia, II, and III) and one small subdomain (Ib) connecting domains II and III (19Allured V.S. Collier R.J. Carroll S.F. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Domain Ia of PE binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (20Kounnas M.Z. Morris R.E. Thompson M.R. FitzGerald D.J. Strickland D.K. Saelinger C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12420-12423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21FitzGerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), also known as the α2- macroglobulin receptor. LRP is expressed on the surface of most mammalian cells and tissues, including those of the immune system (22Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Domain II mediates translocation to the cytosol, and domain III has ADP-ribosylating activity (23Hwang J. FitzGerald D.J. Adhya S. Pastan I. Cell. 1987; 48: 129-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Once bound to LRP, the toxin traffics via coated pits to an endosomal compartment, where it is cleaved by the protease, furin, to generate a 37-kDa C-terminal fragment composed of domains II, Ib, and III (24Ogata M. Fryling C.M. Pastan I. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25396-25401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chiron M.F. Fryling C.M. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18167-18176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment translocates to the cell cytosol, ADP-ribosylates elongation factor 2, and shuts down protein synthesis. When glutamic acid 553 in domain III is deleted (ΔE553), the toxin still gains access to the cytosol (26Ogata M. Chaudhary V.K. Pastan I. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20678-20685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but is rendered nontoxic since this mutation eliminates ADP-ribosylating activity (27Lukac M. Pier G.B. Collier R.J. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 3095-3098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the construction of our chimeras, we deleted much of subdomain Ib from the (ΔE553) version of PE and substituted V3 loop sequences of various sizes in its place. The resulting chimeras were characterized structurally, evaluated for display of V3 loop sequences, and tested as immunogens for the generation of antiviral responses. Plasmid pMOA1A2VK352 (24Ogata M. Fryling C.M. Pastan I. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25396-25401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), encoding PE, was digested with SfiI and ApaI (residues 1143 and 1275, respectively) and then re-ligated with a duplex containing a novel PstI site. The coding strand of the duplex had the following sequence: 5′-TGGCCCTGACCCTGGCCGCCGCCGAGAGCGAGCGCTTCGTCCGGCAGGGCACCGGCAACGACGAGGCCGGCGCGGCAAACCTGCAGGGCC-3′. The resulting plasmid encoded a slightly smaller version of PE that lacked much of domain Ib. The PstI site was subsequently used to introduce duplexes encoding V3 loop sequences flanked by cysteine residues. To make nontoxic proteins, vectors were modified by subcloning to introduce the enzymatically inactive domain III from pVC45ΔE553. An additional subcloning, from pJH4 (23Hwang J. FitzGerald D.J. Adhya S. Pastan I. Cell. 1987; 48: 129-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), was needed to produce a vector that lacked a signal sequence. Insertion of duplexes and subcloning modifications were initially verified by restriction analysis, and final constructs were confirmed by dideoxy double strand sequencing. All ntPE-V3 loop chimeric proteins were expressed in Escherichia coliSA2821/BL21(λDE3) using a T7promoter/T7 polymerase system (28Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). SA2821/BL21(λDE3) cells were transformed with the appropriate plasmid and grown to an absorbance of 1.0 (600 nm) in medium containing ampicillin. To induce high level protein expression, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (1 mm) was added to the culture and incubated for an additional 90 min. E. coli cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 (TE buffer) and dispersed using a Tissue Miser. Cell lysis was accomplished with lysozyme (200 μg/ml; Sigma). Membrane-associated proteins were removed by washing with 2.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m NaCl. PE-V3 loop chimeras were present in inclusion bodies, which were recovered by centrifugation. After washing with TE containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and then with TE alone, inclusion bodies were solubilized by the addition of 6 m guanidine and 65 mmdithioerythritol. Refolding was allowed to proceed at a final protein concentration of 100 μg/ml for a minimum of 24 h at 8 °C in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 ml-arginine (Sigma), 2 mm EDTA, and 0.9 mm glutathione. The protease inhibitor 4,2-aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF, Boerhinger Mannheim) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, 2 mmEDTA and 100 mm urea, pH 7.4. Following dialysis, proteins were applied to a Q Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 0.1m NaCl, chimeric proteins were eluted with 0.3m NaCl in the same buffer and concentrated using Centriprep-30 ultrafiltration devices (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). A high performance liquid chromotography gel filtration column (G3000SW; Toso Haas, Montgomeryville, PA) was used to isolate final products. A typical yield of properly folded protein per 4 liters of bacterial culture was 50–100 mg, with a purity greater than 95%. Chimeric proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 8–16% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA), and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA) and exposed to either an anti-PE mouse monoclonal antibody (M40–1; Ref. 29Ogata M. Pastan I. FitzGerald D.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 407-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or an anti-gp120 mouse monoclonal antibody (1F12 for MN sequences or 1B2 for Thai-E sequences; Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The primary antibody was detected by a secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Reactive products were visualized by the addition of diaminobenzadine and hydrogen peroxide. Immunocapture experiments were performed for 30 min at 23 °C using anti-gp120 monoclonal antibodies. Antibody-chimeric protein complexes were recovered with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and separated using SDS-PAGE (as above). Recombinant forms of gp120 derived from HIV-1-MN (gp120/MN, subtype B; Genentech, Inc.) and a Thai subtype E isolate (gp120/Thai-E-Chiang Mai; Advanced Biotechnologies, Columbia, MD) were used as standards. To determine sulfhydryl content, chimeric proteins (15 nmol) in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, were reacted with 1 mm dithionitrobenzoate (Pierce) for 15 min at 23 °C. The release of thionitrobenzoate was monitored at 412 nm. Dithionitrobenzoate reactivity was confirmed by the use of cysteine. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were collected on an Aviv 60DS spectropolarimeter. Near-UV CD spectra (400 nm to 250 nm) were obtained in 0.2-nm increments with a 0.5-nm bandwidth and a 5-s time constant (150 readings/s averaged) for samples in a 1-cm path length cell. Far-UV spectra (250 nm to 190 nm) were collected in 0.2-nm increments with a 0.5-nm bandwidth and a 3-s time constant in a 0.05-cm path length cell. Each spectrum was digitally smoothed using the Savitsky-Golay algorithm (30Gorry P.A. Anal. Chem. 1990; 62: 570-573Crossref Scopus (587) Google Scholar), corrected for concentration, and normalized to units of mean residue weight ellipticity (ΘMRW) using the following relationship.ΘMRW=Θobs(Mr(monomer)/nmonomer)10(d)(c)Equation 1 Θobs is the observed ellipticity,Mr(monomer) is the molecular weight of the monomer, nmonomer is the number of amino acids in the monomer, d is the path length of the cell (cm), and c is the concentration of the sample in the cell (mg/ml). Human A431 (epidermoid carcinoma) cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at 1 × 105 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, cells were treated for 18 h at 37 °C with 4-fold dilutions of either wtPE or toxic forms (with a glutamic acid residue at position 553 and capable of ADP-ribosylating elongation factor 2) of the chimeric proteins. Inhibition of protein synthesis was assessed by monitoring the incorporation of [3H]leucine. Rabbits were immunized subcutaneously at four sites with 200 μg (total) of each ntPE-V3 chimeric protein. The first injection was administered with complete Freund's adjuvant. All subsequent injections (at 2, 4, and 12 weeks) were given with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Venous bleeds were obtained weekly after the third injection and screened by immunoblotting against gp120. Ninety-six-well plates (Pierce) were coated with gp120 (100 ng/well) derived from either an MN strain or a Thai strain (gp120/Chiang Mai from ABI; see above). Gp120 in PBS was added for 2 h at room temperature followed by a blocking solution of 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Tween 20. Subsequent washes were with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS (TPBS). The appropriate dilution of primary antibody in TPBS was added to each well for 30–60 min at room temperature. To detect the primary antibody, donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1000 in TPBS was added for 30 min. Bound peroxidase was visualized using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine (Pierce) mixed with 0.01% hydrogen peroxide. H2SO4 was added to quench the reaction and allow absorbance to be measured at 450 nm. Prebleed sera were used to determine nonspecific binding in the assay. To determine specific binding, absorbance with a prebleed serum sample was subtracted from the corresponding value obtained with immune sera. In preliminary experiments, anti-PE antibodies were shown to interfere with access to the V3 loop of the ntPE-V3 chimeras. To remove anti-PE reactivity, immune sera were first passed over a PE affinity column. Sera passing through the column were retained for use in the above mentioned ELISA. To make the affinity column, wtPE (10 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.0, and reacted with CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Serum samples of 5–8 ml were passed over individual columns of approximately 2 mg each of wtPE. One assay utilized MT4 cells as a indicator of HIV-1-mediated cell death (31Miyoshi I. Kubonishi I. Yoshimoto S. Akagi T. Ohtsuki Y. Shiraishi Y. Nagata K. Hinuma Y. Nature. 1981; 294: 770-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Duplicate serial dilutions of antiserum were incubated with HIV-1/MN (provided by M. Norcross, Food and Drug Administration and grown in FDA/H9 cells (32Popovic M. Sarngadharan M.G. Read E. Gallo R.C. Science. 1984; 224: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar)) and the mixture added to MT4 cells for 7 days. Viral-mediated cell death was assessed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye assay (33Robertson G.A. Kostek B.M. Schleif W.A. Lewis J.A. Emini E.A. J. Virol. Methods. 1988; 20: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and spectrophotometric analysis at 570 nm. The serum 50% inhibitory concentration was calculated and reported as the neutralization titer. A second assay used p24 production of as an indicator of viral growth (34Wrin T. Loh T.P. Vennari J.C. Schuitemaker H. Nunberg J.H. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 39-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary virus was first titrated to determine the amount that reproducibly yielded significant but submaximal amounts of p24. Virus preparations were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with various dilutions of rabbit sera, either immune or prebleed, and this mixture was then added in quadruplicate to 2.5 × 105 PBMCs. The culture continued for 3 days at which time cells were washed and resuspended in medium containing interleukin 2. Accumulation of p24 was detected by an ELISA. Wild-type (wt) PE is composed of 613 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 67,122 Da. Deletion of a glutamic acid 553 (ΔE553) results in a nontoxic version of PE (27Lukac M. Pier G.B. Collier R.J. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 3095-3098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), referred to as ntPE (Fig. 1 A). To generate chimeric proteins, we replaced much of subdomain Ib with V3 loop sequences (Fig. 1 B) from either an MN (subtype B) or Thai (subtype E) strain of HIV-1. The MN sequence is from a T-cell-tropic strain, and the Thai-E sequence comes from a macrophage-tropic strain. Plasmids were constructed by inserting oligonucleotide duplexes encoding V3 loop sequences into a PE-based vector that was designed with a novel PstI site (see “Experimental Procedures”). In an effort to produce a V3 loop of similar topology to that found in gp120, the 14- or 26-amino acid inserts were flanked by cysteine residues (Fig. 1 C,bold type). Construction of the vector resulted in several changes in the amino acid sequence of ntPE near the insertion point of the V3 loop (Fig. 1 C, italics). Insertion of an irrelevant 16-amino acid sequence resulted in the construction of a control chimera referred to as ntPE-FP16. Removal of the Ib loop (6 amino acids) and modification of flanking amino acids adjacent to the V3 loop insert resulted in a small increase in molecular mass compared with wild-type PE (Fig. 1 C). SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2 A) of purified ntPE-V3 loop chimeras was consistent with calculated masses (Fig. 1 C). Western blots, using monoclonal antibodies raised against gp120/MN (1F12) or gp120/Thai-E (1B2), showed strain-specific reactivity with the MN- and Thai-E-V3 loop chimeras (Fig. 2 B). Free sulfhydryl analysis of purified ntPE-V3 loop chimeras failed to demonstrate any unpaired cysteines (data not shown), suggesting that the purified ntPE-V3 loop chimeras had refolded and oxidized to form a novel disulfide bond at the base of the V3 loop (Fig. 1 B). We anticipated that the formation of this disulfide bond would result in the exposure of the V3 loop at the surface of the chimeras. This was tested directly by immunocapture studies (Fig. 2 C). The 1F12 and 1B2 monoclonal antibodies selectively captured the soluble MN and Th-E chimeric proteins confirming that the V3 loops were accessible to antibody probes. Despite the fact that the 1F12 antibody reacted strongly with ntPE-V3MN14 in Western blots (Fig. 2 B), it captured only a small amount of soluble protein (Fig. 2 C,lane 3), suggesting that the reactive epitope was not completely accessible when only 14 amino acids were inserted. To evaluate the impact of amino acid inserts on the secondary structure of the chimeras, we performed near- and far-UV CD spectral analysis on purified ntPE-V3MN14 and ntPE-V3MN26 proteins and compared these to wild-type PE (wtPE) (Fig. 3, Aand B). Secondary structure calculations (Fig. 3 C) suggested that there were no significant differences between these proteins and wtPE. ntPE-V3MN14 demonstrated more negative ellipticity than ntPE-V3MN26 and wtPE, suggesting more strain may occur on the disulfide bond at the base of the loop insert for this chimera. Both ntPE-V3MN14 and ntPE-V3MN26 showed an apparent red-shift at 290 nm, possibly due to the additional tyrosine residues in the chimeras. Alternatively, this red-shift could result from a slight environmental perturbation of a tryptophan residue. Altogether, these results suggest that the V3 loop inserts did not produce large alterations in the secondary structure relative to wild-type toxin and that changes in tertiary structure were consistent with the presence of the 14 and 26 amino acid inserts. Because inserts were placed within the C-terminal fragment of PE that normally translocates to the cytosol, it was of interest to determine whether the V3 loop influenced translocation efficiency. We tested this directly by producing enzymatically active versions of PE-V3MN14 and 26 (containing glutamic acid 553 and having the ability to ADP-ribosylate elongation factor 2) and comparing their activity with wtPE in cytotoxicity assays. Both PE-V3MN26 (shown in Fig. 4) and PE-V3MN14 (data not shown) exhibited similar toxicity to wtPE in human A431 cells. We conclude that neither the size of the insert, the location of placement nor the presence of a novel disulfide bond impeded delivery to the cytosol. Further, these data suggest that the isolation, refolding and purification protocol used to prepare these chimeras resulted in the production of a correctly folded and functional protein. To investigate the immune response to the chimeras, rabbits were injected subcutaneously with 200 μg of either the MN or Thai-E version of the protein. In Western blots, serum samples from rabbits immunized with the ntPE-V3MN proteins exhibited a strong reactivity for immobilized recombinant gp120/MN (Fig. 5 A). Reactive titers increased with time. At 6 weeks, reactivity was noted at 1:200 dilution; at 12 weeks, reactivity was noted at 1:5,000 dilution; and at later times, reactivity could be detected at 1:25,000. Anti-V3 loop/MN sera were either less reactive or not reactive with gp120/Thai-E (Fig. 5 A). Rabbits injected with the ntPE-V3ThE produced reactive sera for gp120/Thai-E with little or no reactivity for gp120/MN (Fig. 5 A). Sera from rabbits injected with nontoxic PE (i.e. ntPE with no insert) exhibited no reactivity for gp120 of either subtype (data not shown). Using an ELISA format, sera from rabbits immunized with either ntPE-V3MN26 or ntPE-V3ThE26 were characterized further. Wells were coated with gp120 derived from either the MN or Thai-E strain and then probed with various dilutions of rabbit antisera. Specific reactivity to both envelope proteins (after background subtraction; see “Experimental Procedures”) was detected down to a dilution of 1:300,000 with a linear response in the dilution range of 1:10,000 to 1:100,000. Specifically, we wished to compare the reactivity for the V3 loop of gp120 with that of the V3 loop inserted within the toxin. However, because most of the antibodies produced against the ntPE-V3 chimeras were to toxin epitopes, it was not useful to probe immobilized chimeric protein directly. Instead we devised a competitive ELISA that allowed comparisons of antibody responses to soluble gp120 with those to soluble ntPE-V3 chimeras. For technical reasons, it was first necessary to remove anti-PE antibodies. This was done by passing immune rabbit sera over a wtPE affinity column and using the flow-through (see “Experimental Procedures”). Relative reactivities for V3 loop sequences was determined by first mixing a 1:10,000 dilution of immune rabbit sera (post-affinity depletion; see above) with various concentrations of either soluble gp120 or ntPE-V3 and then measuring the residual reactivity for immobilized gp120. When assessing reactivity to immobilized gp120/MN, soluble gp120/MN exhibited a slightly better blocking activity than ntPE-V3MN26 (Fig. 5 B). Neither soluble gp120/Thai-E nor ntPE-V3ThE26, up to concentrations of 20 nm, exhibited any blocking activity (data not shown). In contrast, when probing immobilized gp120/Thai-E, ntPE-V3ThE26 exhibited a greater blocking activity than gp120/Thai-E (Fig. 5 C). Neither soluble gp120/MN nor ntPE-V3MN26 exhibited any blocking activity (Fig. 5 C). Together, these data support the conclusion derived from Fig. 2, i.e. that the V3 loop sequence cloned into recombinant PE closely resembles the same loop contained within gp120. Sera from immunized rabbits neutralized HIV-1 infectivity in two separate in vitroassays (Figs. 6 and7). Pre-immune sera showed no protection of a human T-cell line, MT4, from killing by HIV-1 MN. However, following immunization with ntPE-V3MN26, sera obtained from one rabbit at weeks 8 and 27 were protective against viral challenge with 50% neutralization occurring at approximately a 1:400 dilution (Fig. 6). Sera from a second rabbit exhibited 50% neutralization a"

Using boronate column chromatography of tryptic peptides from tubulin bearing [3H]GTP and exposed to UV light, these workers established that a covalent bond had been formed between the E site nucleotide and Cys-12 of β-tubulin. Our strategy is outlined in Fig. 1. Employing dGTP-driven assembly, we prepared tubulin in which the E site GDP/GTP was replaced with dGDP (9Hamel E. Lustbader J. Lin C.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to minimize formation of guanosine-containing peptides that would interact with the boronate matrix with its affinity forcis-diols. Because dGDP-tubulin still contained covalently bound ribose following photoactivation, we isolated the ribose-enriched peptide(s). We found that a single peptide derived from the N site was retained by the boronate matrix, and the reactive amino acid was Cys-295 of α-tubulin. Bovine brain tubulin was purified as before (10Hamel E. Lin C.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4173-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The boronate matrix (Affi-gel 601) was from Bio-Rad, Texas Red hydrazide was from Pierce, EP-GC (sequencing grade) was from Promega, and 16% polyacrylamide gels, polyvinylidene difluoride, and nitrocellulose membranes were from Novex. Tubulin (1, 800 mg) at 20 mg/ml in 1 m monosodium glutamate (pH 6.6), 2 mmdGTP, and 1 mm MgCl2 was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Polymer was harvested by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 20 min in a 37 °C rotor, and the polymer pellet was homogenized in 25 ml of 1 m glutamate on ice. Denatured protein was removed by centrifugation at 0 °C (20 min at 35,000 rpm), and another assembly/disassembly cycle was performed with the supernatant. Four cycles were performed, yielding 510 mg of dGDP-tubulin. The reaction mixture contained dGDP-tubulin at 12 mg/ml in 0.2 m4-morpholineethanesulfonate (pH 6.9) and 2 mmMgCl2-EGTA-dithiothreitol. About 2–4 ml of this mixture was spread in plastic weighing boats on ice and irradiated at 254 nm for 15 min (2750 μW/cm2). N-Ethylmaleimide (6 mm) was added to the mixture, which was left at 4 °C overnight. Protein was harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. Residual protein was precipitated with 50% trichloroacetic acid and harvested by centrifugation. The combined pellets were dried by lyophilization. The tubulin (2 mg/ml) was treated with alkaline phosphatase (5Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 3 h at 37 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9) and then with 20 mg/ml CNBr in 70% formic acid for 24 h in the dark. CNBr was removed by repeated lyophilization and resuspension of the peptides in water. For EP-GC digestion, CNBr peptides were dissolved in 1% SDS, diluted 10-fold with 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 9), and treated at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50 in 0.1m phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) at 22 °C for 20 h. Peptide mixtures were applied to Affi-gel 601 (5Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (column, 1 × 15 cm; flow rate, 1 ml/min). CNBr peptides were dissolved in boiling 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the solution was diluted 10-fold with 50 mmglycine-NaOH buffer (pH 10). CNBr/EP-GC peptides were dissolved in boiling 1% SDS and diluted 10-fold with the 50 mm glycine buffer. After sample application, the column was washed with glycine buffer until elution of unbound peptides was complete. Bound peptides were eluted with 0.1 m formic acid. Peptide-containing fractions were pooled and processed for SDS-PAGE. GDP-tubulin was induced to assemble with dGTP (9Hamel E. Lustbader J. Lin C.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with four assembly cycles performed. Nucleotide content of the resulting dGDP-tubulin is shown in Fig. 2 C, in comparison with standards (Fig. 2 A) and the nucleotide content of the original GDP-tubulin (Fig. 2 B). Despite the multiple dGTP-driven assembly cycles, there was 5–10% residual GDP, presumably bound to the E site. This could have resulted from incomplete exchange, due to the lower affinity of dGTP for the E site (9Hamel E. Lustbader J. Lin C.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), copolymerization of GDP-tubulin with dGTP-tubulin (11Hamel E. Batra J.K. Lin C.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7054-7062Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and/or slow leaching of N site GTP into the medium from denatured tubulin. Photolabeling conditions were studied with [8-14C]GDP-tubulin (12Grover S. Hamel E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and a 15-min exposure to UV light seemed optimum (Fig. 3). To follow putative labeling of the N site, we compared orcinol reactivity (detects ribose but not deoxyribose (13Ashwell G. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 73-105Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar)) of dGDP-tubulin and GDP-tubulin following exposure to UV light and recovery of protein by gel filtration in 8 m urea. Both dGDP-tubulin and GDP-tubulin became orcinol-reactive following UV irradiation, and orcinol reactivity of protein did not occur without irradiation. The GDP-tubulin was as much as 3–4-fold more reactive than the dGDP-tubulin, indicating reduced efficiency of the covalent interaction of N site GTP relative to E site GDP. We attempted to quantitate the extent of the orcinol reaction, but the tubulin requirement was prohibitive. Moreover, tubulin quenched color obtained with ribose standards. We proceeded to CNBr digestion of UV-exposed dGDP-tubulin. An additional experiment confirmed that we had a ribose-containing peptide. The entire digest was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membrane treated by a method designed to label glycoproteins (periodate oxidation and then reaction with Texas Red hydrazide). Although multiple bands were observed following staining of a duplicate sample with Coomassie Blue (not shown), there was a single prominent band following the periodate/hydrazide reaction (Fig. 4, gel A). This result required that the tubulin be exposed to UV light. We proceeded to removal of ribose-containing peptides by chromatography of the CNBR digest of dGDP-tubulin on the boronate matrix. No peptide bound to the boronate matrix unless the tubulin had been UV irradiated. The bound peptide fraction was eluted with formic acid and subjected to SDS-PAGE. There were two peptide bands (Fig. 4, gel B), both of which were sequenced (Table I). The major b1 peptide yielded an amino acid sequence for 17 cycles consistent with the large CNBr peptide spanning residues 204–302 of α-tubulin (14Ponstingl H. Krauhs E. Little M. Kempf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2757-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), with the exception of Cys-213 (cysteine residues cannot be identified by automated Edman degradation). We therefore conclude that this peptide has been cross-linked to the N site GTP by UV irradiation. The minor b2 peptide yielded a sequence for 13 cycles (except for Cys-12) consistent with the CNBr peptide spanning residues 2–72 of β-tubulin (15Krauhs E. Little M. Kempf T. Hofer-Warbinek R. Ade W. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4156-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This peptide includes the Cys-12 residue that cross-links to the E site nucleotide (5Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it presumably derives from the residual E site GDP in the dGDP-tubulin (Fig. 2 C).Table IAmino acid sequence analysis of the major guanosine-containing peptides derived from dGDP-tubulinCycleCNBr peptidesCNBr/EP-GC peptidesb1b2c1c2 1Val (α-204) (Pro)Arg (β-2)Ile (α-291) (Gly)Ile (β-4) 2AspGluThrVal 3AsnIleAsnHis 4GluValAlaIle 5AlaHisX (α-295 = Cys)Gln 6IleIlePheAla 7TyrGlnGluGly 8AspAlaProGln 9IleGlyAlaX (β-12 = Cys)10X (α-213 = Cys)GlnAsnGly11ArgX (β-12 = Cys)GlnAsn12ArgGlyMetGln13AsnAsnIle14LeuGly15AspAla16IleLys17Glu Open table in a new tab To further define the reactive N site amino acid in the α-204–302 peptide, we employed several proteases. The best results were obtained with EP-GC, which cleaves at the carboxyl side of glutamate and, to a lesser extent, aspartate residues. A CNBr digest of dGDP-tubulin was further digested with this protease and applied to the boronate matrix. The acid eluate on SDS-PAGE yielded two peptide bands (Fig. 4,gel C), which were sequenced (Table I). The c1 peptide spanned residues 291–302 of α-tubulin, with the exception of Cys-295. The c2 peptide spanned residues 3–19 (except Cys-12) of β-tubulin, again including the E site Cys-12 residue (5Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because a modified amino acid residue would not be identified by sequential Edman degradation and because every expected amino acid except Cys-295 was identified in peptide c1, we conclude that it is α-tubulin Cys-295 that reacts covalently with the N site GTP during UV irradiation. Presumably the same photoreaction described by Shivannaet al. (5Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that occurs between the E site GTP and β-Cys-12 occurs between the N site GTP and α-Cys-295. This mechanism included loss of the C-6 carbonyl from guanine, with the covalent bond formed between the S atom of cysteine and the C-5 atom of guanosine. We sought evidence for this by micro-HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry. The boronate-bound samples used to generate the b1, c1, and c2 peptides were examined by this technique, and each HPLC peak was subjected to high resolution mass spectrometry. Mass spectral peaks were obtained corresponding to peptides cross-linked to the guanosine fragment predicted by the mechanism of Shivanna et al. (5Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for α-residues 204–302 and 291–302 and β residues 4–22 (Table II).Table IILC-MS molecular masses of ribose-containing peptides derived from dGDP-tubulin following digestion with CNBr or with CNBr and EP-GCPeptideCalculated weightsObtained weight (±S.D.)No adduct derived from guanosine+ Guanosine (−2H)2-aAssumes a reaction between the S atom of cysteine and C-8 of guanosine.+ Guanosine fragment2-bThe mechanism proposed by Shivanna et al.

Open table in a new tab Analysis of sequence homologies in proteins has been invaluable in predicting protein function and ligand binding sites, including nucleotide sites. Tubulin sequences, however, are sufficiently different from those of other GTP binding proteins to have been a theoretical challenge for precise identification of GTP binding sites (16Sternlicht H. Yaffe M.B. Farr G.W. FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Burns R.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2123-2130PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the extensive sequence homology between α- and β-tubulin, combined with localization of the E site to β-tubulin (5Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hesse J. Thierauf M. Ponstingl H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15472-15475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Linse K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3233-3242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), led to the widespread assumption that the N site is on α-tubulin. Our studies confirm this prediction and represent the first successful attempt at defining tubulin amino acid residues near the N site GTP by cross-linking experiments. Based on the proposed mechanism of the photoinduced covalent bond between a cysteine residue and GTP (5Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this reaction should occur between the S atom of α-Cys-295 and C-5 of the guanine moiety. It is particularly interesting that the homology between α- and β-tubulin in the region of α-Cys-295 is not extensive, and that there are no obvious sequence homologies between the α-tubulin peptide we have isolated and the β-tubulin E site peptides previously reported (5Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hesse J. Thierauf M. Ponstingl H. J. Biol.

Haley B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3233-3242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may reflect the profoundly different properties of nucleotide bound at the E and N sites. Nogales et al. (18Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar) presented a detailed model of the tubulin α-β-dimer based on electron crystallographic analysis of paclitaxel-stabilized sheets of antiparallel protofilaments induced by zinc. In this model each subunit had a bound guanine nucleotide in a Rossmann-type fold, confirming the prediction that the α-subunit contained the N site. There was little difference in the overall conformation of the two subunits. In the zinc sheets all GTP binding sites were shielded by the adjacent subunit, explaining the nonexchangeability of all polymer-bound nucleotide in both E (19Weisenberg R.C. Deery W.J. Dickinson P.J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4248-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and N sites. Although specific αβ pairs in soluble dimers could not be identified, Nogales et al. (18Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar) proposed that in the heterodimer the N site on α-tubulin remained shielded by β-tubulin, explaining its inaccessibility, whereas the E-site on β-tubulin would become exposed to the medium, explaining the rapid equilibration of bound with free nucleotide. This model agreed with observations indicating that the β-subunit was at the plus end of microtubules (20Mitchison T.J. Science. 1993; 261: 1044-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This “steric hindrance” explanation of N site properties, however, fails to explain the total nonexchangeability of nucleotide bound to α-tubulin, because the αβ-heterodimer readily dissociates into its subunits (21Detrich III, H.W. Williams Jr., R.C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3900-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22Sackett D.L. Zimmerman D.A. Wolff J.

Yet N site GTP remains totally nonexchangeable in cells (27Spiegelman B.M. Penningroth S.M. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1977; 12: 587-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and through multiple cycles of assembly with radiolabeled GTP (9Hamel E. Lustbader J. Lin C.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Grover S. Hamel E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or GTP analogs (Ref. 28Hamel E. Lin C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2720-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar and Fig. 2 C). Moreover, no evidence for nucleotide exchange into the N site of dissociated tubulin monomer could be found when such exchange was specifically sought (26Shearwin K.E. Perez-Ramirez B. Timasheff S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, the N site remains inaccessible in the dissociated α-subunit, as well as in α-tubulin bound to the β-subunit in heterodimer. In terms of the current studies, in the model of Nogales et al. (18Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar) Cys-295 of α-tubulin appears to be too distant from the N site GTP to account for the covalent interaction we have observed. Because the reaction occurs rapidly and only a single amino acid reacts with the GTP, it seems unlikely that the reaction is nonspecific or results from tubulin denaturation. Most likely there is a conformational change in soluble heterodimer relative to zinc polymer that brings Cys-295 close enough to the guanine residue for the photoreaction to occur. An alternative possibility, particularly in view of the apparently low efficiency of the α-Cys-295 reaction as compared with the β-Cys-12 reaction, is that the reactive residue is close to the guanine moiety only when the αβ-heterodimer dissociates. A substantial conformational change could occur in the α-monomer so that additional portions of the polypeptide chain prevent access to the N site. This could explain the observed total nucleotide nonexchangeability in steric terms despite reversible subunit dissociation. Finally, photoaffinity studies do not identify amino acid residues that are essential components of ligand binding sites, but only residues that are close to ligands occupying such sites. Our work demonstrates that in soluble tubulin a significant proportion of α-tubulin Cys-295 is in close proximity to the guanine residue occupying the N site. We thank Dr. R. H. Himes for helpful discussions regarding use of the boronate affinity technique for isolation of guanosine-containing peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1989041945,"Abstract In addition to the glucocorticoid receptor, DNA-binding proteins called accessory factors play a role in hormone activation of many glucocorticoid-responsive genes. Hormonal regulation of the γ-fibrinogen subunit gene from the frog Xenopus laevis requires a novel DNA sequence that binds a liver nuclear protein called Xenopus glucocorticoid receptor accessory factor (XGRAF). Here we demonstrate that the recognition site for XGRAF encompasses GAGTTAA at positions −175 to −169 relative to the start site of transcription. This sequence is not closely related to the binding sites for known transcription factors. The two guanosines make close contact with XGRAF, as shown by the methylation interference assay. Single-point mutagenesis of every nucleotide in the 9-base pair region from positions −177 to −169 showed an excellent correlation between ability to bind XGRAF in vitro and ability to amplify hormone-induced transcription from DNA transfected intoXenopus primary hepatocytes. Conversely, XGRAF had little or no effect on basal transcription of the γ-fibrinogen gene. Maximal hormonal induction also requires three half-glucocorticoid response elements (half-GREs) homologous to the downstream half of the consensus GRE. Interestingly, the XGRAF-binding site is immediately adjacent to the most important half-GRE. This close proximity suggests a new mechanism for activation of a gene lacking a conventional full GRE."
