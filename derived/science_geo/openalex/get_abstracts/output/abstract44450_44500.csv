https://openalex.org/W2085077927,"Tumor necrosis factor, or cachectin (TNF-α), a protein with a wide range of biological activities, is produced mainly by macrophages and may be important in inflammatory processes. The role of TNF-α in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria was investigated in a murine model. Most CBA mice infected with Plasmodium berghei anka die between days 6 and 14 with acute neurological manifestations unrelated to the level of parasitemia, whereas mice of some other strains have malaria of the same severity that ends in death after 3 to 4 weeks without neurological manifestations. The activity of serum TNF-α was considerably increased in CBA/Ca mice with cerebral malaria but not in Plasmodium berghei-infected mice that did not develop this complication. One injection of rabbit antibody to TNF-α on day 4 or 7 fully protected infected mice from cerebral malaria without modifying the parasitemia, whereas immunoglobulins from normal rabbit had no effect. In mice with cerebral malaria, the cerebral vessels showed focal accumulations of packed macrophages often containing infected erythrocytes; this lesion was not seen in mice treated with antibody to TNF-α or in untreated mice without cerebral malaria. These findings indicate that TNF-α has an important role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria in this murine model and suggest that local accumulation and activation of macrophages may lead to the predominance of lesions in the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2154662820,"We have used two-dimensional neutral/alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis to separate the nascent strands of replicating yeast 2μm plasmid DNA molecules according to extent of replication, away from nonreplicating molecules and parental strands. Analysis of the lengths of nascent strands by sequential hybridization with short probes shows that replication proceeds bidirectionally from a single origin at map position 3700 ± 100, coincident with the genetically mapped ARS element. The two recombinational isomers of 2μm plasmid (forms A and B) replicate with equal efficiency. These results suggest that ARS elements may prove to be replication origins for chromosomal DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2031410274,"The steroid hormones corticosterone and testosterone are supplied to the central nervous system by endocrine glands, the adrenals and gonads. In contrast, the 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-derivatives of cholesterol, pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone, accumulate in the rat brain through mechanisms independent of peripheral sources. Immunohistochemical studies have been performed with specific antibodies to bovine adrenal cytochrome P-450scc, which is involved in cholesterol side-chain cleavage and pregnenolone formation. The enzyme was localized in the white matter throughout the brain. Scarce clusters of cell bodies were also stained in the entorhinal and cingulate cortex and in the olfactory bulb. These observations strongly support the existence of ""neurosteroids,"" which have been posited on the basis of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral studies."
https://openalex.org/W2121897510,"The nuclear lamina in adult mammalian somatic cells is composed of three major proteins, lamins A, B, and C. The expression of these proteins during the differentiation of teratocarcinomas and mouse embryogenesis is described. Embryos up to day 8 of gestation and embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells express only a single lamin species closely resembling, if not identical to, lamin B. Lamins A and/or C were detected in fertilized eggs, but disappear during the first 2-4 cleavage divisions, only reappearing in 8 day post-implantation embryos. These two lamins are absent from EC cells, but are strongly expressed in some of their derivatives. These results show that cells of the early mouse embryo do not have a functional requirement for lamins A and C and imply that the structural organization of the nucleus may change fundamentally during embryogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1482076136,"We have examined the effects of extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations upon basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in isolated rat adipocytes. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake were significantly reduced. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport was optimal at 1 and 2 mM Ca2+. Further increases in extracellular Ca2+ concentration (3 mM) significantly diminished insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. When intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were augmented by ionomycin (1 microM), insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was significantly reduced at extracellular Ca2+ concentrations of 2 and 3 mM. The levels of intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations were then measured with Ca2+ indicator fura-2. The correlation between the levels of intracellular free Ca2+ and the magnitude of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake revealed that the optimal effect of insulin is observed at Ca2+ levels between 140 and 370 nM. At both extremes outside of this window, both low and high levels of intracellular Ca2+ result in diminished cellular responsiveness to insulin. These data suggest that intracellular calcium concentrations may exert a dual role in the regulation of cellular sensitivity to insulin. First, there must exist a minimal concentration of intracellular calcium to promote insulin action. Second, increased levels of intracellular calcium may provide a critical signal for diminution of insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W2083628730,"An in vitro method has been used to examine whether secretion of renin from the juxtaglomerular apparatus is affected by changes in the sodium chloride concentration of the tubular fluid at the macula densa. Single juxtaglomerular apparatuses were microdissected from rabbits and the tubule segment containing the macula densa was perfused, while simultaneously the entire juxtaglomerular apparatus was superfused, and the fluid was collected for renin measurement. In this preparation, in which influences from renal nerves and local hemodynamic effects are eliminated, a decrease in the tubular sodium chloride concentration at the macula densa results in a prompt stimulation of the renin release rate."
https://openalex.org/W2021731125,"Previous experimental results along with the structural modeling presented indicate that a nucleotide fold starts in the amino-terminal part of Escherichia coli isoleucyl-transfer RNA synthetase, a single chain polypeptide of 939 amino acids. Internal deletions were created in the region of the nucleotide fold. A set of deletions that collectively span 145 contiguous amino acids yielded active enzymes. Further extensions of the deletions yielded inactive or unstable proteins. The three-dimensional structure of an evidently homologous protein suggests that the active deletions lack portions of a segment that connects two parts of the nucleotide fold. Therefore, the results imply that removal of major sections of the polypeptide that connects these two parts of the fold does not result in major perturbation of the nucleotide binding site."

https://openalex.org/W1598947871,"The chlorophyll-protein complexes of purified maize photosystem II membranes were separated by a new mild gel electrophoresis system under conditions which maintained all of the major chlorophyll a/b-protein complex (LHCII) in the oligomeric form. This enabled the resolution of three chlorophyll a/b-proteins in the 26-31-kDa region which are normally obscured by monomeric LHCII. All chlorophyll a/b-proteins had unique polypeptide compositions and characteristic spectral properties. One of them (CP26) has not previously been described, and another (CP24) appeared to be identical to the connecting antenna of photosystem I (LHCI-680). Both CP24 and CP29 from maize had at least one epitope in common with the light-harvesting antennae of photosystem I, as shown by cross-reactivity with a monoclonal antibody raised against LHCI from barley thylakoids. A complex designated Chla.P2, which was capable of electron transport from diphenylcarbazide to 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, was isolated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. It lacked CP43, which therefore can be excluded as an essential component of the photosystem II reaction center core. Fractionation of octyl glucoside-solubilized photosystem II membranes in the presence and absence of Mg2+ enabled the isolation of the Chla . P2 complex and revealed the existence of a light-harvesting complex consisting of CP29, CP26, and CP24. This complex and the major light-harvesting system (LHCII) are postulated to transfer excitation energy independently to the photosystem II reaction center via CP43."
https://openalex.org/W1597352920,"A single amino acid substitution (Asp to Asn) at position 138 of Escherichia coli elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) was introduced in the tufA gene clone by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. The mutated tufA gene was then expressed in maxicells. The properties of [35S]methionine-labeled mutant and wild type EF-Tu were compared by in vitro assays. The Asn-138 mutation greatly reduced the protein's affinity for GDP; however, this mutation dramatically increased the protein's affinity for xanthosine 5'-diphosphate. The mutant protein forms a stable complex with Phe-tRNA and xanthosine 5'-triphosphate, which binds to ribosomes, whereas it does not form a complex with Phe-tRNA and GTP (10 microM). These results suggest that in EF-Tu.nucleoside diphosphate complexes, amino acid residue 138 must interact with the substituent on C-2 of the purine ring. Thus, in wild type EF-Tu, Asp-138 would hydrogen bond to the 2-amino group of GDP, and in the mutant EF-Tu, Asn-138 would form an equivalent hydrogen bond with the 2-carbonyl group of xanthosine 5'-diphosphate. Aspartic acid 138 is conserved in the homologous sequences of all GTP regulatory proteins. This mutation would allow one to specifically alter the nucleotide specificity of other GTP regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1539476045,"The incision and excision steps of nucleotide excision repair in Escherichia coli are mediated by ABC excinuclease, a multisubunit enzyme composed of three proteins, UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC. To determine the DNA contact sites and the binding affinity of ABC excinuclease for damaged DNA, it is necessary to engineer a DNA fragment uniquely modified at one nucleotide. We have recently reported the construction of a 40 base pair (bp) DNA fragment containing a psoralen adduct at a central TpA sequence (Van Houten, B., Gamper, H., Hearst, J. E., and Sancar, A. (1986a) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14135-14141). Using similar methodology a 137-bp fragment containing a psoralen-thymine adduct was synthesized, and this substrate was used in DNase I-footprinting experiments with the subunits of ABC excinuclease. It was found that the UvrA subunit binds specifically to the psoralen modified 137-bp fragment with an apparent equilibrium constant of K8 = 0.7 - 1.5 X 10(8) M-1, while protecting a 33-bp region surrounding the DNA adduct. The equilibrium constant for the nonspecific binding of UvrA was Kns = 0.7 - 2.9 X 10(5) M-1 (bp). In the presence of the UvrB subunit, the binding affinity of UvrA for the damaged substrate increased to K8 = 1.2 - 6.7 X 10(8) M-1 while the footprint shrunk to 19 bp. In addition the binding of the UvrA and UvrB subunits to the damaged substrate caused the 11th phosphodiester bond 5' to the psoralen-modified thymine to become hypersensitive to DNase I cleavage. These observations provide evidence of an alteration in the DNA conformation which occurs during the formation of the ternary UvrA.UvrB.DNA complex. The addition of the UvrC subunit to the UvrA.UvrB.DNA complex resulted in incisions on both sides of the adduct but did not cause any detectable change in the footprint. Experiments with shorter psoralen-modified DNA fragments (20-40 bp) indicated that ABC excinuclease is capable of incising a DNA fragment extending either 3 or 1 bp beyond the normal 5' or 3' incision sites, respectively. These results suggest that the DNA beyond the incision sites, while contributing to ABC excinuclease-DNA complex formation, is not essential for cleavage to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1485160972,"Escherichia coli DNA photolyase binds to DNA containing pyrimidine dimers with high affinity and then breaks the cyclobutane ring joining the two pyrimidines of the dimer in a light- (300-500 nm) dependent reaction. In order to determine the structural features important for this level of specificity, we have constructed a 43 base pair (bp) long DNA substrate that contains a thymine dimer at a unique location and studied its interaction with photolyase. We find that the enzyme protects a 12-16-bp region around the dimer from DNase I digestion and only a 6-bp region from methidium propyl-EDTA-Fe (II) digestion. Chemical footprinting experiments reveal that photolyase contacts the phosphodiester bond immediately 5' and the 3 phosphodiester bonds immediately 3' to the dimer but not the phosphodiester bond between the two thymines that make up the dimer. Methylation protection and interference experiments indicate that the enzyme makes major groove contacts with the first base 5' and the second base 3' to the dimer. These data are consistent with photolyase binding in the major groove over a 4-6-bp region. However, major groove contacts cannot be of major significance in substrate recognition as the enzyme binds equally well to a thymine dimer in a 44-base long single strand DNA and protects a 10-nucleotide long region around the dimer from DNase I digestion. It is therefore concluded that the unique configuration of the phosphodiester backbone in the strand containing the pyrimidine dimer, as well as the cyclobutane ring of the dimer itself are the important structural determinants of the substrate for recognition by photolyase."
https://openalex.org/W1607804847,"In order to determine if the major acidic phospholipids of Escherichia coli are essential to the organism, we constructed a null allele (pgsA30) of the pgsA gene thus rendering the organism incapable of synthesizing phosphatidylglycerol or cardiolipin. In strains carrying the pgsA30 allele cell viability, synthesis of gene product and the ability to synthesize the two major acidic phospholipids were dependent on the presence of a functional copy of the pgsA gene carried on a plasmid which was temperature-sensitive for replication. Growth ceased at the temperature restrictive for plasmid replication when the acidic phospholipid content dropped to about 10% of wild type levels which is slightly higher than the level reported in cells carrying the pgsA3 allele in a genetic background derived from strain SD12; the latter cells, which are capable of synthesizing low levels of acidic phospholipids, were previously shown to have no abnormal growth phenotype (Miyazaki, C., Kuroda, M., Ohta, A., and Shibuya, I. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 7530-7534). The pgsA30 allele, unlike the pgsA3 allele, could not support growth in strain SD12. Neither allele could support growth in two other independently derived strains of E. coli. Therefore, there is a direct dependence of cell viability on a functional pgsA gene product. Strain SD12 appears to contain a suppressor which allows cells with a reduced capability to synthesize acidic phospholipid (pgsA3 allele) to grow, but cannot support growth in cells with a complete lack of synthetic capability (pgsA30 allele)."
https://openalex.org/W1487777358,"Abstract The promoter-specific binding of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase to the T7-A3 and the lacUV5 promoters at 0 degrees C was analyzed by DNase I footprinting. At 37 degrees C, the footprint from RNA polymerase bound to the A3 promoter is essentially the same as that reported by Galas, D.J., and Schmitz, A., (1978) Nucleic Acids Res. 5, 3157-3170 for the lacUV5 promoter. At 0 degrees C, the footprint for the A3 promoter is well defined but reduced in size. The principal difference between the 0 and 37 degrees C footprints is a region from -2 to +18 which is protected by polymerase at the higher but not at the lower temperature. In contrast, the 0 degree C footprint for the lacUV5 promoter differs substantially in character from the footprint for A3 at 0 degree C. The footprint is similar to the pattern of DNase I digestion of DNA bound to a surface; alternating regions of sensitive and protected DNA are spaced at intervals of about 10 base pairs. This region of DNase I-sensitive and -resistant DNA has the same boundaries as the 0 degree C footprint on T7-A3. Temperature shift experiments confirmed the sequence specificity of the RNA polymerase interaction with UV5 at 0 degree C. These results indicate that RNA polymerase binds specifically to each promoter sequence in a closed complex. The increased time and amounts of RNA polymerase required to form the 0 degree C footprint on the lacUV5 promoter indicate that it binds RNA polymerase more weakly than does the T7-A3 promoter. Therefore there is a correlation between the binding constant for closed complex formation estimated from kinetic measurements and the formation of the 0 degree C footprint. The -35 region of the promoter may be more important in establishing the 0 degree C footprint because the T7-A3 promoter is a better match to the consensus sequence. Conversely, the -10 region seems less important because lacUV5 is a perfect match to the consensus, whereas the T7-A3 promoter matches at only five out of seven positions. The 0 degree C footprints encompass both regions along with the spacer; the combination of these regions rather than an individual region may determine the character of the footprint and the magnitude of the binding constant."
https://openalex.org/W1548149868,"Immunofluorescence and electron microscopical studies on the intracellular distribution of intermediate filaments (IFs) have demonstrated a close proximity of these cytoskeletal structures to cellular membranes. Moreover, nonepithelial IF (protein)s have been shown to exhibit high affinities for lipids, especially for negatively charged and nonpolar lipids. Here, using hydrophobic labeling with the photoactivatable phosphatidylcholine analogue [3H]1-palmitoyl-2-[11-[4-(trifluoromethyldiazirinyl]undecanoyl+ ++]-sn- glycero-3-phosphorylcholine or with 1-azidopyrene at low and physiological ionic strength, it is demonstrated that the IF subunit protein vimentin can interact with the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayers, in addition to strong ionic relationships between both reactants. Whereas the presence of acidic phospholipids in the lipid vesicles was absolutely essential for efficient vimentin labeling, cholesterol played a synergistic role in this reaction. Proteolytic degradation of photolabeled vimentin localized the derivatization exclusively to the non-alpha-helical, highly positively charged N-terminal domain of the filament protein. Furthermore, circular dichroism studies performed on the isolated N terminus of vimentin revealed a significant increase in the alpha-helical content of the polypeptide upon its interaction with vesicles containing negatively charged phospholipids. These results indicate an amphiphilic character of the N terminus and suggest that the cationic arginine residues of the N-terminal domain react with the negatively charged head groups of acidic phospholipids prior or parallel to interaction of the polypeptide with hydrophobic regions of the lipid bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1578827617,"Lactaldehyde dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.2.1.22) of Escherichia coli has been purified to homogeneity. It has four apparently equal subunits (molecular weight 55,000 each) and four NAD binding sites per molecule of native enzyme. The enzyme is inducible, only under aerobic conditions, by at least three different types of molecules, the sugars fucose and rhamnose, the diol ethylene glycol and the amino acid glutamate. The enzyme catalyzes the irreversible oxidation of several aldehydes with a Km in the micromolar range for alpha-hydroxyaldehydes (lactaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, or glycolaldehyde) and a higher Km, in the millimolar range, for the alpha-ketoaldehyde methylglyoxal. It displays substrate inhibition with all these substrates. NAD is the preferential cofactor. The functional and structural features of the enzyme indicate that it is not an isozyme of other E. coli aldehyde dehydrogenases such as glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase, or acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The enzyme, previously described as specific for lactaldehyde, is thus identified as a dehydrogenase with a fairly general role in aldehyde oxidation, and it is probably involved in several metabolic pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1578757409,"Total cytochrome P-450 levels rise in diabetic rats. Two specific forms of cytochrome P-450 that are elevated have been isolated from liver microsomes of streptozotocin-induced idabetic male rats. One enzyme, termed RLM6, metabolizes aniline and acetol, but not testosterone, in a reconstituted system with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. RLM6 is isolated as a high spin cytochrome with a minimum molecular weight of 53,500. It has a unique amino-terminal amino acid sequence lacking methionine at the amino-terminal position. Polyclonal antibodies to RLM6 recognized most other forms of cytochrome P-450 in Western blots, but could be made monospecific by adsorption to cross-reacting proteins coupled to Sepharose 4B. Using the monospecific antibodies, RLM6 was estimated to be present in microsomes of untreated male rats at 0.04 nmol/mg protein (5% of total P-450). In chronically diabetic rats this level rose to 0.35 nmol/mg protein and 24% of the P-450 content. Immunoreactive protein of molecular weight identical to RLM6 was elevated in microsomes of non-diabetic rats treated with ethanol, acetone, or isoniazid as well as in rats starved for 48 h. Insulin treatment of diabetic rats for 1 week lowered the immunologically detectable levels of RLM6 to levels found in the untreated rat. The other form of cytochrome P-450, RLM5b, does not metabolize aniline and only poorly metabolizes acetol and testosterone. This 52.5-kDa protein is isolated as a predominantly (60%) high spin enzyme. It has a unique NH2-terminal amino acid sequence with methionine as the terminal residue, and is present in untreated male rat liver microsomes at 0.16 nmol/mg protein. It is elevated in diabetes, like RLM6, but treatment with insulin for 1 week does not completely restore the microsomal content to that of the non-diabetic rat."
https://openalex.org/W1597256738,"We have studied function and structure of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in a monensin-resistant (Monr-31) mutant isolated from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. To assay the ability of the receptor to bind LDL, we employed three methods, 125I-LDL binding to the cells at 4 degrees C, 125I-LDL binding to the receptor-phospholipid complex (Schneider, W.J., Goldstein, J.L., and Brown, M.S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11442-11447), and ligand blotting (Daniel, T.O., Schneider, W.J., Goldstein, J.L., and Brown, M.S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 4606-4611). The LDL receptor number was similar in both CHO and Monr-31, but the binding affinity was reduced in the mutant. The semi-quantitative immunoblotting assay with an antibody directed against the COOH-terminal 14 amino acids and the ligand-blotting assay with LDL also showed that the relative steady-state level of the receptor in Monr-31 was comparable to that in CHO, whereas the binding capacity of the receptor in Monr-31 was lower than that in CHO. The precursor and degradation forms of the LDL receptors produced in the mutant cells were similar in size to those in the parental cells, but the apparent molecular mass of the mature receptor protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels was reduced about 5000 daltons in the mutant. These results suggest a structural change at the NH2-terminal LDL binding domain. Tests of the effects of tunicamycin, endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (O-glycanase), and sialidase (neuraminidase) on the molecular size of the mature receptors indicated that the reduced size of the receptor in the mutant cells resulted from altered oligosaccharide chain(s) linked to serine/threonine residues in the binding domain. We compared the molecular sizes and binding activity of human LDL receptors in several clones derived from CHO and Monr-31 cells which were transfected with human LDL receptor cDNA. The human LDL receptors produced in the transfected clones of Monr-31 were also smaller in molecular size and lower in binding capacity than those produced in the transfected clones of CHO. These results suggest that both structural and functional alteration of the LDL receptor of Monr-31 is not caused by a mutation in the structural gene of the LDL receptor but by altered processing or maturation of the receptor. The correlation of the decrease in molecular size and reduced binding capacity of the LDL receptor is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1516580081,"A short DNA sequence, 5'ATATAAGTA(+1)3', extending from -8 to +1 nucleotides has been shown to function as a promoter in the yeast mitochondrial genome. A complete set of single site mutations of this nonanucleotide promoter sequence has been constructed, cloned, and used to promote specific in vitro transcription using a highly purified mitochondrial RNA polymerase. Each deviation from the natural promoter sequence results in a reduction or abolition of specific transcription depending on the nucleotide substituent. The nucleotide at -8 is not considered as a component of the promoter. Any nucleotide at position +1 is compatible with correct transcriptional initiation. The consensus sequence that exists in vivo is the strongest promoter since only down mutations are seen among the substitutions. The mutant analyses indicate that a very short octanucleotide sequence comprised of 5'TAT/aAA/g/cGT/a/cN(+1)3' is the minimal sequence necessary to direct accurate initiation by mitochondrial RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1547781918,"Negatively charged reactants are sensitive reactivity probes of the active site of cysteine proteases (Halasz, P., and Polgar, L. (1977) Eur. J. Biochem. 79, 491-494). Thus, the thiolate-imidazolium ion pair of papain reacts at an enhanced rate with iodoacetate due to a favorable interaction between the positive imidazolium ion of the ion pair and the negative carboxylate of the alkylating agent. We have found that cathepsin B, the closely related lysosomal cysteine protease, also shows enhanced reactivity toward iodoacetate, indicating the presence of the catalytically competent thiolate-imidazolium ion pair in this enzyme. However, the pH dependence of the reaction is different. Papain exhibits a simple bell-shaped curve, whereas cathepsin B exhibits a complex pH dependence which is controlled by an ionizing group with a pKa of about 5.5. This finding indicates the existence of two reactive forms associated with the active site of cathepsin B: a high reactivity form below pH 5.5 and a low reactivity form above pH 5.5. The former accounts for the exopeptidase (peptidyl dipeptidase) activity of the enzyme and the latter for the endopeptidase activity, measured with the highly specific substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Arg-2-naphthylamide. As seen from active site models, cathepsin B, in contrast to papain, contains a triad of charged groups near the thiolate-imidazolium ion pair which is composed of Glu-131, Arg-162, and Glu-205. A net negative charge above pH 5.5 and the positive charge of Arg-162 below pH 5.5 may control the exo- and endopeptidase activities, as well as the alkylation with iodoacetate. This can be mediated through electrostatic interactions with the charged reactants and, possibly, also by causing a conformational change in the geometry of the thiolate-imidazolium ion pair."
https://openalex.org/W2100149500,"Schistosomes utilize proteases (termed hemoglobinases) for degradation of host globin. cDNA clones encoding Schistosoma mansoni protease were isolated by immunologically screening an expression cDNA library with antisera raised against purified hemoglobinase. Confirmation of the identities of the clones was obtained immunologically and biochemically. The bacterially produced fusion protein encoded by one clone, lambda Hb2, degraded hemoglobin in vitro. The sequence of this clone suggested that this S. mansoni protease is synthesized in a precursor form in vivo. Gene titrations indicated that S. mansoni contains multiple genes corresponding to this cDNA. The expression of these genes may be regulated during the organism's life cycle since adult, female worms contained the highest abundances of homologous mRNA and protein compared to other stages."
https://openalex.org/W2025585748,"The function of the neurite growth-promoting antigen INO has been tested in an in vivo neurite regeneration system, the rat iris. The sympathetic innervation of the irides was removed by a single systemic injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. The subsequent regeneration of sympathetic axons into the iris of one eye bathed by the INO antibody, which inhibits neurite growth in vitro, was compared with the regrowth of sympathetic axons into the iris of the animal's other eye, which contained control antibody. Antibodies were released within the eye by implanted hybridoma cells. Neurite regeneration was measured by assaying [3H]norepinephrine uptake into freshly explained irides. The blockage of the function of the INO antigen by the antibody resulted in a decreased rate of axonal regeneration, thus suggesting the involvement of the INO antigen in the process of neurite regeneration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1495265719,"Abstract Using the rapid-mixing/photocross-linking technique developed in our laboratory, we have investigated the kinetics of interaction between Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and pAR1319, a recombinant plasmid DNA containing the bacteriophage T7 A2 early promoter. By monitoring the time-dependent density of bound RNA polymerase along the relaxed circular DNA molecule using this technique, we have been able to demonstrate kinetic evidence for linear diffusion of RNA polymerase along DNA in a different system from that previously described (Park, C. S., Hillel, Z., and Wu, C.-W. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 6950-6956). The nonspecific association rate constant kon was measured to be 7.7 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 at a DNA chain concentration of 22.4 nM. By taking advantage of the fact that rapid mixing displaces bound protein molecules from DNA, but leaves them within the domain of the DNA, the rate of intradomain binding of RNA polymerase to pAR1319 DNA was determined to be 8.2 s-1. Since the plasmid is described by a radius of gyration of 0.22 microns, the intradomain concentration of base pairs could be calculated. Using this concentration (180 microM), the rate constant for intradomain nonspecific association of RNA polymerase to pAR1319 DNA was estimated to be 4.6 x 10(4) M-1 s-1. In addition, a mathematical model has been used to fit the other two important rate constants to the experimental data: koff, which describes the dissociation of RNA polymerase from nonspecific binding sites, and D1, the one-dimensional diffusion coefficient of the enzyme along the DNA molecule. In this model, the circular DNA molecule is described as a ring of interconnected binding sites which together comprise a DNA domain. RNA polymerase, which enters the domain via three-dimensional diffusion and binds to each site, is allowed to diffuse linearly between adjacent sites and three-dimensionally on and off the DNA molecule. The rate equations for the time-dependent occupancy of each site by RNA polymerase could be written, based on general principles. By solving the resulting family of differential equations, koff and D1 were determined to be 0.3 s-1 and 1.5 x 10(-9) cm2 s-1, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1592522379,"The tertiary structure of the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (HPr) of the Escherichia coli phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system has been determined by x-ray diffraction at 2.8-A resolution. Initially, a partial structure was fitted to the multiple isomorphous replacement map and then least-squares refined by the Konnert/Hendrickson restrained parameter method (Konnert, J. H., and Hendrickson, W. A. (1980) Acta Crystallogr. A36, 344-350) and finally, a subsequent map was computed by use of the phase combination method of Read (Read, R. J. (1986) Acta Crystallogr. A42, 140-149). More of the protein structure was located in the latter map. The procedure of model building, least-squares refinement, and electron density map recalculation was repeated until the tertiary structure of HPr was obtained. The overall structure of HPr consists of four beta-strands, three helical regions, and four beta-turns. At the active center, the His15 imidazole interacts with one oxygen atom of the alpha-carboxyl C terminus of the polypeptide chain; the conserved Arg17 side chain interacts with the other oxygen atom of the alpha-carboxyl C terminus as well as with the side chain of Glu85. This is the first x-ray analysis of a protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. Furthermore, this work represents a protein structure which has been solved by starting with a model that represented only one-third of the scattering matter."
https://openalex.org/W1636692352,"Synthesis of yeast 5 S rRNA in a homologous cell-free system has previously been shown to be inhibited by exogenous yeast 5 S rRNA. This inhibition is diminished when 5 S rDNA is first incubated with the cell-free system, implying the presence of a transcription factor IIIA analog in yeast, and is dependent on the nucleotide sequence of the 5 S rRNA added. A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method was used to demonstrate assembly of newly synthesized 5 S rRNA into a ribonucleoprotein complex containing ribosomal protein YL3. Immunodepletion of the cell-free system with anti-YL3 IgG was found to increase the sensitivity of 5 S rRNA synthesis to inhibition by 5 S rRNA. We propose a model for the regulation of yeast 5 S rRNA synthesis in which YL3 competes with the presumptive transcription factor IIIA analog for binding of 5 S rRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1507592137,"Leader peptidase of Escherichia coli, a protein of 323 residues, has three hydrophobic domains. The first, residues 1-22, is the most apolar and is followed by a polar region (23-61) which faces the cytoplasm. The second hydrophobic domain (residues 62-76) spans the membrane. The third hydrophobic domain, which has a minimal apolar character, and the polar, carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the protein are exposed to the periplasm. Deletion of either the amino terminus (residues 4-50) or the third hydrophobic region (residues 83-98) has almost no effect on the rate of leader peptidase membrane assembly, while the second hydrophobic domain is essential for insertion (Dalbey, R., and Wickner, W. (1987) Science 235, 783-787). To further define the roles of these domains, we have replaced the normal, cleaved leader sequence of pro-OmpA and M13 procoat with regions containing either the first or second apolar domain of leader peptidase. The second apolar domain supports the translocation of OmpA or coat protein across the plasma membrane, establishing its identity as an internal, uncleaved signal sequence. In addition to this sequence, we now find that leader peptidase needs either the amino-terminal domain or the third hydrophobic domain to permit its rapid membrane assembly. These results show that, although a signal sequence is necessary for rapid membrane assembly of leader peptidase, it is not sufficient."
https://openalex.org/W1540687701,"Renin is formed by intracellular processing of prorenin and catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, the precursor to angiotensin II. Several tissues synthesize prorenin. However, in man, the kidney is the only known source of circulating renin, raising the possibility that the processing enzyme is unique to that tissue. We have transfected a gene that directs prorenin synthesis in pituitary AtT-20 cells, which are capable of processing other prohormones. The results demonstrate that transfected AtT-20 cells can secrete inactive prorenin, accurately process prorenin to active renin, and be stimulated to release active renin in response to a secretagogue. These data imply that cellular elements capable of directing the processing of prorenin to renin and its correct subcellular compartmentalization may be present in nonrenal cell types and that critical elements of the regulated release of renin that occur in the kidney can be reconstituted in cells in culture."
https://openalex.org/W1504211443,"Expression of the Escherichia coli maltose regulon is controlled by MalT, a transcriptional activator (Mr = 102,288) encoded by the malT gene. Activation of transcription depends on the presence of the inducer, maltotriose. Using an in vitro transcription/translation assay to monitor the protein, we have purified MalT in native form from MalT-overproducing bacteria. The purified protein is able to promote transcription from different MalT-controlled promoters in well-defined in vitro systems. Maltotriose and the MalT protein suffice to stimulate initiation of transcription at malPp by the E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme. In contrast, both MalT protein and cAMP receptor protein are required with their respective effectors, maltotriose and cyclic AMP, for activation of malEp. These data are in agreement with in vivo observations. In addition, we present evidence that MalT is an ATP-binding protein, a result suggesting that ATP may play a role in transcription initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1581932487,"A Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase has been purified which catalyzed the phosphorylation and concomitant inactivation of both the microsomal native (100,000 Da) and protease-cleaved purified 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) (53,000 Da) fragments. This low molecular weight brain cytosolic Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase phosphorylates histone H1, synapsin I, and purified HMG-CoA reductase as major substrates. The kinase, purified by sequential chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, calmodulin affinity resin, and high performance liquid chromatography (TSKG 3000 SW) is an electrophoretically homogeneous protein of approximately 110,000 Da. The molecular weight of the holoenzyme, substrate specificity, subunit protein composition, subunit autophosphorylation, subunit isoelectric points, and subunit phosphopeptide analysis suggest that this kinase of Mr 110,000 may be different from other previously reported Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases. Maximal phosphorylation by the low molecular form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase of purified HMG-CoA reductase revealed a stoichiometry of approximately 0.5 mol of phosphate/mol of 53,000-Da enzyme. Dephosphorylation of phosphorylated and inactivated native and purified HMG-CoA reductase revealed a time-dependent loss of 32P-bound radioactivity and reactivation of enzyme activity. Based on the results reported here, we propose that HMG-CoA reductase activity may be modulated by yet another kinase system involving covalent phosphorylation. The elucidation of a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent HMG-CoA reductase kinase-mediated modulation of HMG-CoA reductase activity involving reversible phosphorylation may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1557962810,"An endonuclease specific for cruciform junctions has been purified from yeast cells treated with a DNA-damaging agent. The activity was followed through five chromatographic steps by assaying for the linearization of supercoiled plasmid DNA, which extrudes cruciform structures in vitro. The sites of cleavage on pColIR215 were sequenced, and nicks were located to positions symmetrically opposed across the cruciform junction. The products of cleavage were unit length linear duplexes that contained terminal hairpin loops. In contrast to pColIR215, the cleavage patterns of pXG540 plasmid DNA were found to be complex, and cuts were found up to 40 bases from an (A-T)34 sequence that extrudes into a cruciform. Little or no activity could be detected on single-stranded DNA, linear duplex DNA, or nicked circular duplex DNA. The nuclease was insensitive to RNase but was inactivated by treatment with proteinase K. Mg2+ was required as cofactor and could not be replaced by Mn2+, Ca2+, Co2+, or Cu2+. The native molecular weight of the activity was approximately 200,000 as estimated by gel filtration."
https://openalex.org/W1503843862,"The gal operon is regulated by binding of Gal repressor to two operator loci, OE and OI, which are separated by 114 base pairs (bp). We have probed the actual operator DNA segments with and without Gal repressor occupation by characterizing the regions protected by repressor from DNase I digestion and dimethyl sulfate methylation. The segments which are protected from DNase I digestion in both OE and OI are about 22 bp long and seem to include 2-3 extra bp on either side of a 16-bp similar sequence containing an approximate dyad symmetry, with a consensus half-symmetry sequence GTG(G/T)AA-C. Repressor occupation hinders the reactivity of the consensus guanines in the four half-symmetry sequences, as shown by retardation of methylation at the N-7 positions by dimethyl sulfate owing to repressor binding. The protected guanines are symmetrically located. Since a dimeric Gal repressor affects symmetrically located bases, it is consistent with the notion that each half-operator is occupied by a repressor subunit. Because the N-7 positions of methylation of guanines lie in the major grooves and the protected guanines are located at positions 1, 3, 8 and the rotational 1', 3', and 8' in the 16-bp dyad symmetry, we suggest that Gal repressor establishes direct contacts with bases at 1, 3, 1', and 3' through two major grooves lying on one face of an operator helix and prevents reactivity of the guanines at 8 and 8' of a third major groove on the opposite face by changing the DNA helical structure at this position. Contacts at other positions are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1510238178,"When a yeast 5 S rRNA gene with a variant 3'-terminal nucleotide sequence was transcribed in a homologous cell-free system, primary transcripts that were shorter, more heterogeneous in length and much more resistant to processing than pre-5 S rRNA from the major 5 S rRNA gene were produced. After 3'-end processing, variant 5 S rRNA was one nucleotide shorter than mature repeat 5 S rRNA and was bound much less strongly to ribosomal protein YL3. The stable variant pre-5 S rRNA appeared to bind another, unidentified protein. The formation of this presumptive ribonucleoprotein complex was disrupted by (Up)4UOH, suggesting that it may contain a yeast analog of the mammalian La protein."
https://openalex.org/W1576346822,"Purified yeast copper-metallothionein lacks 8 amino-terminal residues that are predicted from the DNA sequence of its gene. The removed sequence is unusual for metallothionein in its high content of hydrophobic and aromatic residues and its similarity to mitochondrial leader sequences. To study the significance of this amino-terminal cleavage, several mutations were introduced into the metallothionein coding gene, CUP1. One mutant, which deletes amino acid residues 2-8, had a minor effect on the ability of the molecule to confer copper resistance to yeast but did not affect CUP1 gene regulation. A second mutation, which changes two amino acids adjacent to the cleavage site, blocked removal of the extension peptide but had no effect on copper detoxification or gene regulation. Immunofluorescence studies showed that both the wild-type and these two mutant proteins are predominantly cytoplasmic with no evidence for mitochondrial localization. The cleavage site mutation allowed isolation and structural characterization of a full length metallothionein polypeptide. The copper content and luminescent properties of this molecule were identical to those of the truncated wild-type protein indicating a homologous cluster structure. Moreover, the amino-terminal peptide was selectively removed by various endopeptidases and an exopeptidase suggesting that it does not participate in the tertiary fold. These results argue that the amino-terminal peptide is not required for either the structural integrity or biological function of yeast metallothionein."
https://openalex.org/W1570097666,"Abstract Both the precursor and the mature form of chicken mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase were synthesized in Escherichia coli. The precursor was found to sediment quantitatively together with insoluble cell material. In contrast, mature mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase could be readily extracted from the cells and was indistinguishable from the enzyme isolated from chicken heart in all respects tested: specific activity 230 units mg-1; Mr 2 X 45,000; pI greater than 9; NH2-terminal sequence SSWWSHVEMG, the initiator methionine having been removed by the bacteria. Thus, the polypeptide chain representing mature mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase is an autonomous folding unit which attains its functional spatial structure independently of the presence of the prepiece, trans-membrane passage, and proteolytic processing."
https://openalex.org/W1554519792,"Saponin-permeabilized rat pancreatic islets degraded exogenously added inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and degradation was inhibited in the presence of either fructose 1,6-bisphosphate or diphosphoglycerate. The addition of either fructose-1,6-P2 or diphosphoglycerate to 45Ca2+-labeled permeabilized islets potentiated 45Ca2+ release caused by IP3 (by either exogenously added IP3 or IP3 generated endogenously in the presence of carbachol or guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S). The effect of diphosphoglycerate and fructose-1,6-P2 on 45Ca2+ release correlated well with the effects of these agents on the recovery of radioactivity in IP3. These results further support our previous proposal that in pancreatic islets intracellular calcium mobilization may be sustained in part via the inhibition of IP3 degradation by metabolites produced during stimulation with insulinotropic concentrations of glucose (Rana, R.S., Sekar, M.C., Hokin, L.E., and MacDonald, M.J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5237-5240)."
https://openalex.org/W2166503747,"Abstract The secondary and tertiary structure of T4 bacteriophage dihydrofolate reductase is investigated by vacuum ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and probability analysis of the primary amino acid sequence. The far ultraviolet CD spectrum of the enzyme in the range of 260-178 nm is analyzed by the generalized inverse and variable selection methods developed by our laboratory. Variable selection yields an average content of 26% alpha-helix, 21% antiparallel beta-sheet, 10% parallel beta-sheet, 20% beta-turns, and 32% structures within the T4 protein. The characteristic peaks of the CD spectrum indicate that the enzyme has a lot of antiparallel beta-sheet, which is typical of the alpha + beta tertiary class of globular proteins. The secondary structure of the protein is also analyzed by using four statistical methods on the amino acid sequence. Although the secondary structures predicted by each individual statistical method vary to a considerable extent, the fractions of each structure jointly predicted by a majority of the methods are in excellent agreement with our CD analysis. The alternating arrangement for some segments of alpha-helix and beta-sheet predicted from primary structure to be within the enzyme is characteristic of proteins containing parallel beta-sheet. This supports our conclusion that the protein contains both parallel and antiparallel beta-sheet structures, but finding both types of beta-sheet also means that the protein may have the variation on alpha/beta tertiary structure recently found in EcoRI endonuclease and thymidylate synthase. These observations, in conjunction with other physical properties of the T4 reductase, suggest that the enzyme perhaps shares an evolution in common with the dihydrofolate reductases derived from type I R-plasmids rather than with the host-cell protein."
https://openalex.org/W1509991182,"DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli contains 2 mol of zinc/mol of holoenzyme (alpha 2 beta beta' sigma) with one zinc each in the beta and beta' subunits. A new method to substitute selectively the zinc in the beta subunit was developed by the inactivation of RNA polymerase with 0.25 M NaNO3, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM diaminocyclohexane tetraacetic acid, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol followed by reconstitution with Co(II), Cd(II), or Cu(II). The hybrid Co-Zn, Cd-Zn, or Cu-Zn RNA polymerase thus obtained retains, respectively, 91, 88, and 50% enzyme activity of the reconstituted Zn-Zn RNA polymerase. Co-Zn RNA polymerase exhibits absorption maxima at 395 and 465 nm, and Cu-Zn RNA polymerase at 637 nm (epsilon = 815 M-1 cm-1). 1-Aminonaphthalene-5-sulfonic acid (AmNS) derivatives of ATP, UTP, and dinucleoside monophosphates (diNMPs), UpA or ApU, were synthesized with AmNS attached to NTP via a gamma-phosphoamidate bond or to diNMPs via a 5'-secondary amine linkage. Since the fluorescence emission maxima of (5'-AmNS)UpA, (gamma-AmNS)ATP, and (gamma-AmNS)UTP at 445, 464, and 464 nm, respectively, when excited at 340 nm, overlap the 465-nm absorption band of Co-Zn RNA polymerase, the spatial relationship between fluorescence substrate analogs and the intrinsic Co(II) in Co-Zn RNA polymerase was studied by fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique. The fluorescence of the initiator, (5'-AmNS)UpA, and elongator, (gamma-AmNS)UTP, of the RNA chain, was quenched 20.3 and 7.1%, by the addition of saturation concentration of Zn-Zn RNA polymerase, and 21.3 and 14.7%, respectively, by the addition of template, poly(dA-dT). The fluorescence of (5'-AmNS)UpA and (gamma-AmNS)UTP was quenched 81.8 and 80.6%, respectively, by the addition of the saturation concentration of Co-Zn RNA polymerase in the absence of template, and 82.7 and 82.9% in the presence of template. On the basis of respective Ro values of 21.3 and 21.9 A for the (5'-AmNS)UpA-Co and (gamma-AmNS)UTP-Co pairs, the distances from Co(II) to the initiation site and to the elongation site were calculated to be 17.4 and 17.5 A, respectively, in the absence and 17.2 and 17.4 A in the presence of template."
https://openalex.org/W1495178874,"In vitro RNA synthesis from the A promoters of T7 bacteriophage by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase is strongly inhibited by daunomycin. Under the conditions of the assay for total RNA synthesis, daunomycin has no effect on the formation of the binary enzyme-template complex. The major inhibitory effect may be exerted during incorporation of the first few nucleotides into the nascent RNA chain. We report here that daunomycin has little effect on the substeps leading to the formation of abortive dinucleotide from the A promoters. A large part of the inhibitory effect of daunomycin is therefore specifically targeted toward a very small final portion of the process of initiation, which may be described as the addition of nucleotides to the initial dinucleotide (and its subsequent translocation) until a stable ternary complex has been formed. The level at which this inhibition is exerted is more precisely defined by examining the effect of daunomycin on the synthesis of the first few oligonucleotides synthesized from the A3 promoter. The major inhibitory effect of daunomycin is found to be specifically exerted during the transformation of the initial dinucleotide to the corresponding trinucleotide. The remainder of the inhibition may be evenly divided among a large number of nucleotide addition steps that transform the nascent trinucleotide to a completed RNA chain. One of the fundamental levels at which transcription is controlled is initiation. In slow-start promoters, e.g. the lac UV5 promoter, the late stages of initiation (when the enzyme has the option of either producing an abortive di- or trinucleotide or proceeding with the formation of a stable ternary complex) may be involved in this control. Inhibitors which specifically act on this stage of initiation may thus prove useful for the study of such systems, as well as transcription in general."

https://openalex.org/W1509012991,"In mammals, the bifunctional protein UMP synthase contains the final two enzymatic activities, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase), for de novo biosynthesis of UMP. The plasmid pMEJ contains a cDNA for the ODCase domain of mouse Ehrlich ascites UMP synthase. The cDNA from pMEJ was joined to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae iso-1-cytochrome c (CYC1) promoter and the first four CYC1 coding nucleotides in the plasmid pODCcyc. ODCase-deficient yeast cells (HF200x1) transformed with pODCcyc expressed an active ODCase domain with a specific activity of 20 nmol/min/mg in cell extracts. The expressed ODCase domain has a lower affinity for the substrate orotidine 5'-monophosphate and the inhibitor 6-azauridine 5'-monophosphate than intact UMP synthase or an ODCase domain isolated after proteolysis of homogenous UMP synthase. Sucrose density gradient sedimentation experiments showed that the expressed ODCase domain forms a dimer in the presence of ligands which bind at the catalytic site. These studies support the existence of an ODCase structural domain which contains the ODCase catalytic site and a dimerization surface of UMP synthase, but the domain may not have the regulatory site required to form the altered dimer form."
https://openalex.org/W1557065281,"Autoproteolysis is an essential activity in the expression of the entire genomes of a number of viruses. That is, new viruses can be produced only after large polyprotein products translated from the genome or from subgenomic mRNA degrade themselves to the polypeptides necessary for RNA replication or for the construction of new virus particles. We have recently shown that the major heat shock protein of Drosophila and a mouse cell line (70 kDa) also undergoes autoproteolysis with the production of specific patterns of smaller polypeptides. We show now that many other proteins in eucaryotic tissues also have a potential for self-degradation. We suggest that special coding regions in many genes may have important roles in both protein turnover and in the production of regulatory peptides."
