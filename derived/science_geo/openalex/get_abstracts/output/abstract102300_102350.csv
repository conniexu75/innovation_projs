https://openalex.org/W2079588007,"Yeast genes were isolated that are required for restoring the osmotic gradient across the cell membrane in response to increased external osmolarity. Two of these genes, HOG1 and PBS2, encode members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) and MAP kinase kinase gene families, respectively. MAP kinases are activated by extracellular ligands such as growth factors and function as intermediate kinases in protein phosphorylation cascades. A rapid, PBS2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of HOG1 protein occurred in response to increases in extracellular osmolarity. These data define a signal transduction pathway that is activated by changes in the osmolarity of the extracellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W1984123968,"Recombinant human macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (rhMIP-1 alpha) and rhMIP-1 beta were potent chemoattractants of human T lymphocytes. These rhMIP-1 cytokines attracted only T cells activated by monoclonal antibody to CD3 and did not attract unstimulated lymphocytes. Phenotypic analysis revealed that CD4+ T cells were capable of migrating in response to rhMIP-1 beta, whereas rhMIP-1 alpha induced chemotaxis of predominantly CD8+ T lymphocytes. Activated naïve and memory T cells also migrated in response to rhMIP-1 cytokines. Furthermore, these cytokines enhanced the ability of T cells to bind to an endothelial cell monolayer. These results suggest that rhMIP-1 cytokines preferentially recruit specific T cell subsets during the evolution of the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1558311166,"Cyclosporin A, a cyclic undecapeptide, and FK506 are efficient immunosuppressive agents. They also attract attention as effective P-glycoprotein modulators that inhibit P-glycoprotein from binding to anticancer drugs and overcome multidrug resistance. Cyclosporin A itself interacts with a common binding site of P-glycoprotein to which Vinca alkaloids and verapamil bind. We were interested to determine whether cyclosporin A and FK506 are substrates for P-glycoprotein to transport, and we studied their transcellular transport. In LLC-PK1 cells, derived from porcine kidney proximal tubule and forming a highly polarized epithelium, cyclosporin A was transported in a saturable manner. LLC-GA5-COL300, a transformant cell line derived by transfecting LLC-PK1 with human MDR1 cDNA isolated from normal adrenal gland, expresses P-glycoprotein specifically on the apical surface and shows a typical multidrug-resistant phenotype. LLC-GA5-COL300 cells showed increased transport of cyclosporin A from the basal to the apical side. Kinetic analysis showed that this transport was a typical saturable transport with the calculated apparent Michaelis constant (Kappm) and the maximum flux (Vmax) as 8.4 microM and 2.4 nmol/mg protein/h, respectively. LLC-GA5-COL300 also showed increased transport of FK506 from the basal to the apical side. These results indicate that P-glycoprotein transports the immunosuppressive agents cyclosporin A and FK506."
https://openalex.org/W2083800765,"Regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolic homeostasis is associated with the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues of key regulatory proteins. The phosphotyrosine phosphatase 1D (PTP 1D) contains two amino terminally located Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and is similar to the Drosophila corkscrew gene product, which positively regulates the torso tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathway. PTP activity was found to be regulated by physical interaction with a protein tyrosine kinase. PTP 1D did not dephosphorylate receptor tyrosine kinases, despite the fact that it associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor and chimeric receptors containing the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor and the cytoplasmic domain of either the HER2-neu, kit-SCF, or platelet-derived growth factor beta (beta PDGF) receptors. PTP 1D was phosphorylated on tyrosine in cells overexpressing the beta PDGF receptor kinase and this tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with an enhancement of its catalytic activity. Thus, protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases do not simply oppose each other's action; rather, they may work in concert to maintain a fine balance of effector activation needed for the regulation of cell growth and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2110048510,"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase, labeled with fluorescein and rhodamine on the catalytic and regulatory subunits, respectively, was injected into Aplysia sensory neurons either in culture or in intact cell clusters. Energy transfer between the subunits, a measure of cytosolic cAMP concentration ([cAMP]), and compartmentation of the dissociated subunits were monitored by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Bath application of serotonin produced a much greater elevation of [cAMP] in the processes than in the central bodies of the neurons. The resulting gradients must drive a sizable centripetal flux of cAMP because direct microinjection of cAMP showed that it diffused readily. Perinuclear increases in [cAMP] slowly caused the translocation of the freed catalytic subunit into the nucleus to an extent proportional to the percentage of its dissociation from the regulatory subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2092668948,"Many microorganisms, including Escherichia coli, can survive extended periods of starvation. The properties of cells that survived prolonged incubation in stationary phase were studied by mixture of 10-day-old (aged) cultures with 1-day-old (young) cultures of the same strain of Escherichia coli. Mutants from the aged cultures that could grow eventually took over the population, which resulted in the death of the cells from the young cultures. This phenotype was conferred by mutations in rpoS, which encodes a putative stationary phase-specific sigma factor. These rapid population shifts have implications for the studies of microbial evolution and ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2002360326,"GluR6, a subunit of high affinity kainate receptor channels in the mammalian CNS, carries a glutamine (Q) or arginine (R) residue in a critical position (Q/R site) of the putative channel-forming segment TM2. One form, GluR6(Q), is encoded by the GluR6 gene; the other, GluR6(R), is generated by RNA editing. Further analysis of cloned GluR6 cDNA revealed that two additional positions, located in transmembrane segment TM1, are diversified by RNA editing to generate either isoleucine (I) or valine (V) in one and tyrosine (Y) or cysteine (C) in the other TM1 position. In GluR6 channels, in contrast with AMPA receptor channels, the presence of Q in the TM2 Q/R site determines channels with low Ca2+ permeability, whereas an R determines a higher Ca2+ permeability if TM1 is fully edited. In the TM1 unedited form of GluR6, Ca2+ permeability is less dependent on the presence of either Q or R in TM2. Thus Ca2+ permeability of kainate receptor channels can vary, depending on editing of both TM1 and TM2."

https://openalex.org/W2007230427,"Murine neural precursor cells and cell lines derived from them are stimulated by members of the heparin-binding fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. The activity of FGF is regulated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), and this interaction is an essential prerequisite for the binding of growth factor to the signal transducing receptors. Messenger RNA for FGF-2 was detectable in the neuroepithelium at embryonic day 9, and the HSPGs produced by these cells at this time preferentially bound FGF-2. However, at embryonic day 11, when messenger RNA for FGF-1 was first detectable, there was a switch in the binding specificity of the HSPG to FGF-1. Thus, a single species of HSPG undergoes a rapid, tightly controlled change in growth factor-binding specificity concomitant with the temporal expression of the FGFs."
https://openalex.org/W2034464839,"The origin of new genes includes both the initial molecular events and subsequent population dynamics. A processed Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene, previously thought to be a pseudogene, provided an opportunity to examine the two phases of the origin of a new gene. The sequence of the processed Adh messenger RNA became part of a new functional gene by capturing several upstream exons and introns of an unrelated gene. This novel chimeric gene, jingwei, differs from its parent Adh gene in both its pattern of expression and rate of molecular evolution. Natural selection participated in the origin and subsequent evolution of this gene."

https://openalex.org/W1507344018,"Nitric oxide synthases in diverse mammalian tissues catalyze the oxidation of L-arginine to L-citrulline plus nitric oxide (NO). In the vascular endothelium, synthesis of NO yields a labile intercellular messenger molecule with potent biological activities, including vascular smooth muscle relaxation. We have recently documented that the endothelial cell NO synthase (EC-NOS) constitutes a genetically distinct tissue-specific enzyme isoform. In further contrast to the soluble NO synthases found in neural tissues and in macrophages, the endothelial enzyme is associated primarily with the particulate fraction. Analysis of molecular clones for the endothelial NO synthase reveals no obvious transmembrane-spanning region, but a consensus motif for N-terminal myristoylation was identified; such a consensus sequence is not evident in the primary sequence of the soluble macrophage and neural NO synthases. We performed oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the myristoylation consensus sequence in the endothelial NO synthase cDNA, and studied the pattern of expression of the wild-type and mutant EC-NOS cDNAs in transient transfection experiments in COS-7 cells. The subcellular localization of heterologous endothelial NO synthase was determined using analyses of enzyme activity as well as immunoprecipitation of biosynthetically labeled NO synthase with a highly specific antipeptide antibody. Expression of the wild-type endothelial NO synthase cDNA in COS-7 cells results in targeting of both enzyme activity and NO synthase immunoreactivity primarily to the particular fraction. By contrast, transient expression of the myristoylation- mutant cDNA in COS-7 cells yields NO synthase enzyme activity and immunoreactivity associated exclusively with the cytosol fraction. Following biosynthetic labeling with [3H]myristate, the NO synthase can be specifically immunoprecipitated from the particulate fraction in endothelial and in COS-7 cells transfected with the wild-type cDNA, but not in cells transfected with the myristoylation- mutant EC-NOS cDNA. N-terminal myristoylation of the endothelial NO synthase may provide a potential point of regulation of the biological functions of endothelium-derived NO in situ."

https://openalex.org/W2078834161,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) control viral infections by recognizing viral peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A11-restricted CTLs that recognize peptide residues 416 to 424 of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen-4 frequently dominate EBV-induced responses in A11+ Caucasian donors. This epitope is conserved in type A EBV strains from Caucasians and central African populations, where A11 is relatively infrequent. However, strains from highly A11+ populations in New Guinea carry a lysine-to-threonine mutation at residue 424 that abrogates CTL recognition and binding of the peptide to nascent A11 molecules. The results suggest that evolution of a widespread and genetically stable virus such as EBV is influenced by pressure from MHC-restricted CTL responses."

https://openalex.org/W1549088009,"Human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) was first purified from plasma of patients with fulminant hepatic failure (Gohda, E., Tsubouchi, H., Nakayama, H., Hirono, S., Sakiyama, O., Takahashi, K., Miyazaki, H., Hashimoto, S., and Daikuhara, Y. (1988) J. Clin. Invest. 81, 414-419) and is now identified to be the same protein as the scatter factor (Weidner, K. M., Arakaki, N., Hartmann, G., Vandekerckhove, J., Weingart, S., Rieder, H., Fonatsch, C., Tsubouchi, H., Hishida, T., Daikuhara, Y., and Birchmeier, W. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 7001-7005) and tumor cytotoxic factor (Shima, N., Nakao, M., Ogaki, F., Tsuda, E., Murakami, A., and Higashio, K. (1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 180, 1151-1158), and it is known to be produced by fibroblasts in culture. Here we report that inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) stimulate production of hHGF from human embryonic lung fibroblasts, MRC-5, and human gingival fibroblasts, GF-5. Recombinant human IL-1 alpha (rhIL-1 alpha) and recombinant human TNF-alpha (rhTNF-alpha) increased hHGF levels in culture supernatants of MRC-5 and GF-5 cells dose-dependently as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for hHGF. The half-maximal stimulatory concentrations of rhIL-1 alpha and rhTNF-alpha were about 1ng/ml and 10 units/ml, respectively. rhIL-1 beta showed almost the same effect as IL-1 alpha on stimulation of production of immunoreactive hHGF from the two cell lines. However, rhIL-6 failed to show the stimulatory effect on hHGF production by the cells in the range of 2-200 units/ml. Human interferon-beta and -gamma also did not show the stimulatory activity. Stimulation of hHGF production was observed 6-12 h after addition of rhIL-1 alpha or rhTNF-alpha and lasted at least 48 h, and the observed stimulation of hHGF production by cytokines was suppressed by addition of corresponding antiserum. hHGF mRNA levels of MRC-5 cells increased by addition of rhIL-1 alpha and rhTNF-alpha in a dose-dependent manner as determined by Northern blot analysis using cDNA for hHGF as a probe. In addition, results from nuclear run-off transcription experiments showed that the two cytokines regulated increasing hHGF gene expression at transcriptional levels rather than a change in mRNA stability. These observations indicate that the inflammatory cytokines modulate the production and secretion of hHGF by fibroblasts and may play an important role for tissue repair and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1554323039,"The human apolipoprotein (apo) E and apoC-I genes are located 5 kilobases apart in the same transcriptional orientation on chromosome 19, and they are expressed at high levels in the liver with lower levels of expression in selected other tissues. Analysis of a series of overlapping human apoE and apoC-I genomic fragments in transgenic mice revealed that the expression of these transgenes in the liver requires a common cis-acting regulatory domain. This hepatic control region (HCR) was localized to a 764-base pair region that is located about 18 kilobases downstream of the apoE promoter and about 9 kilobases downstream of the apoC-I promoter. All the transgenic animals that had been prepared with a construct that contained this region had relatively high levels of transgene expression in the liver, whereas constructs that lacked this region showed no expression in the liver. In situ hybridization studies showed that the HCR directed apoE and apoC-I transgene expression in hepatocytes. When the HCR from the apoE/C-I gene locus was ligated proximal to a human apoA-IV gene fragment, which is not normally expressed in the liver, the resulting apoA-IV/HCR fusion construct was expressed at high levels in the liver, indicating that the HCR could direct high level liver expression of a heterologous promoter/gene construct. Expression of the apoE transgene in the liver and kidney, and perhaps other tissues, required the presence of a nonspecific proximal enhancer element in the apolipoprotein E gene promoter, located between 161 and 141 bp relative to the transcription initiation site. However, the proximal apoE gene promoter, including this enhancer element, contained no sequences capable of directing hepatocyte expression in the absence of the HCR. Thus, the far-downstream HCR appears to contain all of the sequences necessary for determining high level liver-specific gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W207069409,"The predominant brain cholecystokinin receptor (CCK-B/gastrin) has been implicated in mediating many of the central effects of cholecystokinin, including anxiety, panic attacks, satiety, and analgesia, suggesting it is an important pharmacologic target. We now report the cloning and characterization of the cDNA encoding the human brain CCK-B/gastrin receptor. The cDNA was isolated from a human brain library by low stringency screening using the canine receptor cDNA as a hybridization probe. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame encoding a 447-amino-acid protein with seven putative hydrophobic transmembrane domains and significant homology with other known members of the gastrin/cholecystokinin receptor family. Agonist and antagonist affinities of the recombinant human brain receptor expressed in COS-7 cells are consistent with a classical receptor as defined by the literature. In COS-7 cells expressing the cloned receptor, CCK-8-stimulated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization suggesting second messenger signaling through phospholipase C. CCK-B/gastrin receptor transcripts were identified in human brain, stomach, and pancreas using high stringency Northern blot analysis. Southern blot hybridization analysis of human genomic DNA indicates that a single gene encodes both the brain and the stomach CCK-B/gastrin receptors. Our data suggest that the CCK-B and gastrin receptors are identical and that the long standing distinction between them may no longer apply."

https://openalex.org/W1992848268,"The wee1 protein kinase suppresses the entry into mitosis by mediatingthe inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of p34cdc2. Genetic studies have suggested that the nim1 protein kinase (also known as cdr1) acts as a positive regulator of mitosis by down-regulating the wee1 pathway in yeast cells. We have overexpressed the nim1 protein in both bacteria and insect cells. The recombinant nim1 protein autophosphorylates on both tyrosine and serine residues and can phosphorylate the isolated wee1 protein directly in a cell-free system. The nim1-catalyzed phosphorylation of the wee1 protein occurs in its C-terminal region and leads to a substantial drop in its activity as a cdc2-specific tyrosine kinase. This nim1-dependent inhibition of the wee1 protein kinase can be reversed readily in vitro by treatment with a protein phosphatase. These experiments provide direct biochemical evidence that the wee1 protein is subject to negative regulation by phosphorylation and indicate that the niml protein acts as an inhibitory, wee1-specific kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2107357655,"Surrogate light chain (psi LC) genes are transcriptionally active in progenitor B (pro-B) cells before immunoglobulin genes are rearranged. Current hypothetical models suggest that the psi LC proteins may couple with surrogate or conventional heavy chain proteins to form cell surface receptors that signal the progressive differentiation of pro-B, precursor B (pre-B), and immature B cells. Monoclonal antibodies were produced and used to examine the synthesis, expression, intermolecular interaction, and function of psi LC during B cell differentiation. The results indicate that, while psi LC production spans several developmental stages, cell surface expression is confined to a relatively late stage in normal pre-B cell differentiation, during which receptor cross-linkage does not impede cell growth or B cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2105259921,"The multifunctional HIV-1 RT (human immunodeficiency virus type 1-reverse transcriptase) enzyme possesses three main functions including the RNA- and DNA-directed DNA polymerases and the RNase H. The bisheteroarylpiperazine U-87201E inhibits the two polymerase functions but not the RNase H. Enzymatic kinetic studies of the HIV-1 RT-catalyzed RNA- and DNA-directed DNA polymerase activities were carried out in order to determine if the inhibitor interferes with either the template:primer or the deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP)-binding sites of the enzyme. The data were analyzed using steady-state kinetics, considering that the polymerase reaction is ordered in that the template:primer is added first, followed by the dNTP and that the enzyme functions processively. The data were consistent with the model. The steady-state rate constants for the forward and backward reactions were of similar magnitude for both the RNA- and DNA-catalyzed DNA polymerases and suggest that both functions share the same substrate-binding sites. The dissociation constants for the enzyme-inhibitor and enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complexes were somewhat higher for the DNA-directed DNA polymerase function as compared to the RNA directed one. This indicates that U-87201E is a more potent inhibitor for the RNA-directed DNA polymerase than the DNA-directed DNA polymerase. The pattern of inhibition exerted by U-87201E was noncompetitive with respect to both the nucleic acid and nucleotide-binding sites of the RT enzyme for both the RNA- and DNA-directed DNA polymerases. Hence, U-87201E inhibits these functions by interacting with a site distinct from the template:primer and dNTP-binding sites. HIV-2 RT was insensitive to U-87201E, demonstrating the unique sensitivity of HIV-1 RT to this inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2090669079,"Group II introns al1 and al2 of the yeast mtDNA cox1 gene encode reverse transcriptase-like proteins that function in RNA splicing and may play a role in intron mobility and excision. We find that ribonucleoprotein particles from yeast mitochondria contain a reverse transcriptase activity that is likely encoded by al1 and al2 and is highly specific for the introns and their flanking exons. Using a mutant strain with elevated activity, we show that the reverse transcriptase uses either excised intron RNA or cox1 pre-mRNA as template and initiates cDNA synthesis near the 3' end of al2 and immediately downstream in E3. Our results suggest that introns al1 and al2 are retroelements, which encode reverse transcriptases that have adapted to function in RNA splicing."

https://openalex.org/W1557265350,"Many cellular properties are influenced by the surrounding environment of extracellular matrix. To better define the interaction between mononuclear phagocytes and the extracellular matrix components they contact, we studied the effect of various matrices on the biosynthesis and secretion of metalloenzymes and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases in human alveolar macrophages. We found that native and denatured collagen types I and III markedly augmented production of interstitial collagenase (> 25-fold) and increased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases to a lesser degree (2.5-fold). In contrast, the biosynthesis of another major secreted macrophage metalloproteinase, 92-kDa gelatinase, was unaffected by contact with extracellular matrices. Furthermore, other matrix components (i.e. type IV collagen, laminin, fibronectin, elastin) failed to induce collagenase production. Maximal stimulation of macrophage collagenase production was achieved with 1-5 micrograms/ml (3-15 x 10(-9) M) denatured collagen in contact with cells for 2 h. Increased biosynthesis of collagenase was detected within 24 h of cell contact with native or denatured collagen and was accompanied by marked induction of collagenase mRNA levels. Our studies of signal transduction mechanisms demonstrated that indomethacin decreased gelatin-induced collagenase production by 90%, with enzyme levels completely restored by the addition of exogenous prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 was only effective when added within the first 2 h after indomethacin treatment. These results indicate that extracellular matrix can directly influence its remodeling and repair via regulation of the production of metalloenzymes by resident inflammatory cells. Furthermore, matrix-metalloproteinase inductive interactions are both enzyme- and matrix-specific, and are mediated, at least in part, by a prostaglandin-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2119892511,"It has recently been discovered that the steroid receptor-associated heat shock protein, hsp56, belongs to the FK506 family of immunophilin proteins. The ability of hsp56 to bind the immunosuppressive macrolide FK506 has led to the speculation that the steroid receptor and immunophilin signal transduction pathways are functionally interrelated. We have tested this idea by assessing the effects of FK506 on glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated expression of the murine mammary tumor virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (MMTV-CAT) reporter plasmid. We report that combined treatment with FK506 and low concentrations of dexamethasone (10(-8) or 10(-7) M) results in a large enhancement of MMTV-CAT gene expression over that seen in response to dexamethasone (Dex) alone. FK506 potentiation of MMTV-CAT expression did not occur at 10(-6) M Dex or in the complete absence of hormone. We also show that potentiation of Dex-mediated MMTV-CAT expression occurs in response to rapamycin, that glucocorticoid-regulated enhancer sequences are sufficient for the FK506-mediated potentiation effect, and that this effect can be blocked by RU486 antagonist. Finally, we provide evidence that FK506 potentiation of GR-mediated gene expression is the result of increased translocation to the nucleus of the GR."
https://openalex.org/W2788910558,"SH3 (Src homology 3) domains are found in many signaling proteins and appear to function as binding modules for cytoplasmic target proteins. The solution structure of the SH3 domain of human phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) was determined by two-dimensional 1H NMR analysis. This SH3 domain is composed of eight antiparallel beta strands consisting of two successive ""Greek key"" motifs, which form a barrel-like structure. The conserved aliphatic and aromatic residues form a hydrophobic pocket on the molecular surface, and the conserved carboxylic residues are localized to the periphery. The hydrophobic pocket may serve as a binding site for target proteins. Analysis of the slowly exchanging amide protons by NMR measurements indicates that despite containing a high content of beta structure, the SH3 domain of PLC-gamma is flexible."
https://openalex.org/W1587901624,"Vaults are large cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particles with a sedimentation value of about 150 S. These particles contain a unique small RNA (vault RNA (vRNA)). We have determined the sequence of the RNA associated with vaults purified from both rat and bullfrog. The rat vRNA is 141 bases in length, whereas the bullfrog vRNA is present as two highly related species of 89 and 94 bases. Despite the differences in length the predicted secondary structures of the three vRNAs are clearly related. All of the vRNAs contain sequences related to the internal promoter elements necessary for transcription by RNA polymerase III. The gene for the rat vRNA was isolated and sequenced from a rat genomic library, and its transcription by RNA polymerase III was verified using an in vitro transcription assay. The rat vRNA gene was efficiently transcribed in vitro, producing a single transcript of about 140 bases. Unlike most RNA polymerase III genes, the rat vRNA is present as a single copy gene and has a distinct tissue-specific expression pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1554964268,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a mitogen for cultured endothelial cells, and a potent angiogenic factor in vivo. Incubation of 125I-VEGF with human or bovine serum led to the formation of 125I-VEGF containing complexes that had a molecular mass greater than 300 kDa. These complexes were specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) antibodies. Similar high molecular weight complexes were formed when 125I-VEGF was incubated with commercially available alpha 2M. The 125I-VEGF.alpha 2M complexes were resistant to boiling in the presence of SDS. The formation of 125I-VEGF.alpha 2M complexes was inhibited by iodoacetic acid, indicating that free sulfhydryl groups are required for complex assembly. Tryptic digestion of alpha 2M did not affect its VEGF binding ability. Tryptic digestion of 125I-VEGF.alpha 2M complexes on the other hand, resulted in the degradation of bound 125I-VEGF, indicating that alpha 2M does not protect bound 125I-VEGF from proteolytic digestion. The binding of 125I-VEGF to alpha 2M was partially inhibited by an excess of basic fibroblast growth factor. Other growth factors which bind to alpha 2M, such as platelet-derived growth factor and insulin, did not inhibit the binding of 125I-VEGF. The binding of VEGF to alpha 2M inhibited its receptor binding ability, indicating that alpha 2M may function as a VEGF removal and inactivation factor. Heparin and heparan sulfate, but not other glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin sulfate, efficiently inhibited the binding of 125I-VEGF to alpha 2M. It is possible that heparin-like molecules released from extracellular matrixes could prevent the inactivation of VEGF by alpha 2M resulting in the potentiation of processes such as tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1593761027,"The NK1 (substance P) and NK3 (neurokinin B) receptors are G protein-coupled receptors sharing approximately 70% identity within the membrane-spanning domains. However, they each have a distinct pharmacological profile in respect of peptide binding. To identify epitopes that determine their selectivity for natural and synthetic tachykinin peptides, we constructed a series of chimeric NK1/NK3 receptors in which carboxyl-terminal segments of increasing length in the NK1 receptor were exchanged with the corresponding segments from the NK3 receptor. The general, structural integrity of the chimeric constructs was confirmed by the amphibian tachykinin peptide, eledoisin, which was recognized equally well by both of the wild-type receptors and bound with a similar or even higher affinity to all the chimeric receptors. Competition binding studies showed that the affinity of the two natural ligands, substance P and neurokinin B, changed gradually through the series of chimeric receptors indicating that several binding epitopes throughout the receptor structure are involved in the selective recognition of these peptides. However, whereas the single, largest change in binding affinity for substance P occurred when segments in the amino-terminal end of the receptor were exchanged, this occurred for neurokinin B in the carboxyl-terminal end of the receptor. The affinity of the NK1-selective ligand, [Sar9,Met(O2)11]SP, changed even more gradually through the series of chimeric receptors than that of substance P. In contrast, the NK3-selective hexapeptide, senktide, was recognized only when transmembrane segment III and IV from the NK3 receptor were incorporated into the chimeric constructs. These data suggest that several receptor domains contribute to the binding specificity of tachykinin agonists but in varying degrees for each peptide. It is concluded that the tachykinin peptides, in partially different ways, interact with multiple epitopes scattered throughout the receptor structure, but conceivably these epitopes are closely located in space around a hypothetical receptor center."
https://openalex.org/W1545168616,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the administration of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to neonatal mice results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates in all organs examined (Donaldson, R. W., and Cohen, S. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 8477-8481). One of these substrates, a 55-kDa protein, was shown to associate with the receptor for EGF (EGFR). We now report the identification of this receptor-associated protein as SHC. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analyses have revealed that SHC associates only with the activated EGFR. In the absence of EGF stimulation, SHC exists in the liver as a cytoplasmic monomer. Intraperitoneal injection of EGF results, within minutes, in the translocation of 50-80% of SHC to the liver plasma membrane. The membrane-associated SHC was found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated; the subsequent release of SHC from the membrane correlated with a tyrosine dephosphorylation. We conclude that SHC is a physiological substrate that appears to participate in the in vivo signaling response to EGF."
https://openalex.org/W1609801461,"The transcription termination factor (mTERF), which plays a central role in the control of mitochondrial rRNA and mRNA synthesis in mammalian mitochondria, has been previously identified and purified by DNA affinity chromatography from a human mitochondrial lysate (Kruse, B., Narasimhan, N., and Attardi, G. (1989) Cell 58, 391-397). In the present work, this factor has been characterized as to its protein composition and the activities of the protein components. Three polypeptides, two of approximately 34-kDa molecular mass and one of approximately 31 kDa, were shown to be associated with the specific DNA binding and footprinting activity of the factor, with the 31-kDa component having a much lower affinity for the recognition sequence than the 34-kDa components. On the other hand, the transcription termination activity, as assayed in an in vitro system, was found to be associated exclusively with the two 34-kDa polypeptides. Mass spectroscopic analysis of tryptic peptides derived from highly purified polypeptides indicated that all three polypeptides share regions with common sequences. The evidence obtained suggests that differential phosphorylation is not responsible for the difference in electrophoretic mobility of the three polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1526283615,"We studied the channel formed by the mycobacterial porin from the cell wall of Mycobacterium chelonae (Trias, J., Jarlier, V., and Benz, R. (1992) Science 258, 1479-1481) by reconstituting the mycobacterial porin and cell wall extracts in lipid bilayer membranes. The channel exhibited two different states in lipid bilayer membranes at 10 mV of applied voltage. One was characterized by a steplike appearance while the other showed a fast, voltage-dependent, flickering behavior between a closed and an open state. The channel was voltage-gated, and starting at 40 mV of applied voltage the mycobacterial porin channel switched to a closed configuration in an asymmetric fashion. The channel was cation-selective and had 2.5-point negative charges at both sides of the channel. Identical channels were observed when membranes were reconstituted with cell wall extracts, suggesting that there is only one porin species in the mycobacterial cell wall."
https://openalex.org/W1548360189,"Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran and pyranine were fed to the social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum. These membrane-impermeable, pH-sensitive fluorophores initially entered a approximately equal to neutral endocytic compartment. They encountered maximal acidity (pH approximately equal to 5) about 15 min after ingestion, in what appeared to be digestive vacuoles (lysosomes). The environment of the probes returned to near neutrality by 30 min. At that time, the probes accumulated in a decreasing number of vacuoles of increasing size; ultimately, there were only a small number of vacuoles per cell with diameters of up to 3 microns. The late vacuoles sedimented more rapidly than did proton pumps, acid hydrolases, and recently ingested cargo. Unlike the vacuoles harvested immediately after the cells were fed FITC-dextran, the late vacuoles were not acidified by MgATP in vitro. Egestion of ingested FITC-dextran commenced after a lag of approximately equal to 45 min. A similar lag was observed for the resurfacing of two endocytosed bilayer-intercalated fluorophores. These results suggest that, in Dictyostelium, undigested endocytic cargo accumulates in and is returned to the cell surface through a distinctive compartment of large and nearly neutral post-lysosomal vacuoles. It will be important to determine the degree to which internalized plasma membrane components follow this post-lysosomal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1480707528,"A dimeric and two trimeric forms of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) were purified from rabbit and Xenopus tissues and analyzed using antisera specific for the catalytic and regulatory subunits. The dimeric holoenzyme consists of a complex between a 36-kDa catalytic subunit associated with a approximately 65-kDa regulatory subunit. The two trimeric holoenzymes consist of the catalytic subunit complexed with 65- and 55-kDa subunits, or 65- and 72-kDa subunits. Antisera were raised against synthetic peptides specific for the alpha- and beta-isoforms of the 65-kDa (PR65 alpha/beta) and 55-kDa (PR55 alpha/beta) subunits identified by molecular cloning. Anti-peptide antisera to the 36-kDa catalytic subunit of PP2A were prepared against two selected regions: one specific for the alpha-isoform and one to a peptide common to both the alpha- and beta-isoforms. Immunochemical analysis of all three mammalian holoenzymes showed that the catalytic, 55- and 65-kDa subunits are both predominantly of the alpha-isoform, which is consistent with the peptide sequence data. The 65-kDa subunit of PP2A holoenzymes isolated from Xenopus skeletal muscle reacted with both anti-alpha and anti-beta PR65-specific antisera whereas the PP2A holoenzymes isolated from Xenopus oocytes reacted preferentially with the beta-specific antisera, indicating developmental changes in the expression of the 65-kDa subunit isoform. Taken together, these results show that the subunits of the PP2A holoenzymes consist of the catalytic complexed with the 65-kDa subunit and that the association of the third subunit does not appear to be influenced by the isoform of these two core subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1583343397,"In Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with m5 muscarinic receptors, carbachol stimulates both calcium influx and calcium release from intracellular stores. The marine toxin maitotoxin (MTX) elicits a similar response on calcium influx. Carbachol- and MTX-induced calcium influx can be inhibited by the proposed blockers of receptor-operated calcium channels (ROCC), CAI and SK&F 96365. Both carbachol and MTX induce a significant increase in total protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which is dependent on extracellular calcium and can be inhibited by CAI and SK&F 96365. Phospholipase C-gamma was identified as one of the substrates subject to calcium-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation following carbachol or MTX stimulation. Carbachol-induced [3H]inositol trisphosphate formation was partially inhibited by an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, by removal of extracellular calcium, and by the inhibitor of receptor-operated calcium channels CAI suggesting that phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma plays a role in the muscarinic activation of phosphoinositide breakdown. Such an effect of carbachol is reminiscent of effects observed with peptide growth factors and represents a novel alternative signaling pathway for a muscarinic G protein-coupled receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1577743059,"The mRNAs coding for interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and IL-1 beta are constitutively transcribed but do not accumulate in human diploid fibroblasts and in fibrosarcoma cells. Treatment of these cells with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces accumulation of IL-1 mRNA by an unknown mechanism. This induction of IL-1 mRNA was investigated in HT-1080 cells. The induction was quite fast, with maximum levels of IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA reached 4 h after addition of TNF. Nuclear run-off experiment showed that TNF did not increase the rate of transcription of IL-1 mRNA. This mRNA was apparently unstable in untreated cells, but it accumulated in cycloheximide-treated cells. Phorbol esters induced IL-1 mRNA, suggesting that activation of protein kinase C was responsible for the accumulation of this mRNA. This hypothesis was confirmed by experiments with the PKC inhibitors staurosporine and calphostin C, which prevented the induction of IL-1 mRNA by TNF and accelerated the decay of this mRNA in cells pretreated with TNF. Both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta were detected in TNF-treated cells by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results indicate that the TNF-mediated induction of IL-1 can be entirely accounted for by stabilization of this mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1599174829,"The murine fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) and keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR) are two products of the same gene which display distinct binding specificities. We and others have shown that a major structural element underlying this functional divergence is a variable 50 amino acids long region constituting the C-terminal half of the third immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain of the receptor. This region of the two receptors is encoded by two distinct exons which are alternatively used in cells of different tissues and origin. To further investigate the role of this confined variable region in determining ligand binding specificity we have generated a chimeric molecule between FGFR1 and KGFR where the variable segment of KGFR replaces the homologous region in FGFR1. Binding studies as well as chemical crosslinking of radiolabeled ligands revealed that the recombinant FGFR1/KGFR chimera has retained the binding affinity to acidic FGF and FGF4 (hst/kfgf) but lost the capacity to bind basic FGF (bFGF). This chimeric receptor bound keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), however, with significantly lower affinity as compared with KGFR. High affinity binding of KGF was acquired only when also domain 2 in this chimera was replaced by its homologous domain from FGFR2. These results demonstrate that ligand binding and specificity involves multiple receptor elements which are located at both Ig-like domain 2 and 3 of FGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1613450630,"Rabbit hemopexin cDNA was cloned from a rabbit liver lambda gt11 cDNA expression library using a mixture of five monoclonal antibodies raised against rabbit hemopexin, and the entire rabbit hemopexin sequence was determined. The heme-binding domain I of rabbit hemopexin (Smith, A., and Morgan, W. T. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12049-12053) contains only 4 histidine residues which are conserved in rabbit, human, rat, and mouse hemopexin. The 2 axial heme-iron coordinating histidine residues, identified by Edman microsequencing and amino acid analyses of chemically modified domain I and isolated fragments of domain I, are the conserved histidine residues at positions 56 and 127 of the mature rabbit protein. The epitope recognized by JEN-14 (a monoclonal antibody which specifically reacts with domain I and blocks the hemopexin-receptor interaction (Morgan, W. T., Muster, P., Tatum, F. M., McConnell, J., Conway, T. P., Hensley, P., and Smith, A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8220-8225) was shown to lie between residues 122 and 142 by Western blotting of protease-digested domain I and transposon-insertion mutants of domain I expressed in a plasmid vector system. The location of this epitope near the heme-binding histidine residue 127 is compatible with a transport mechanism in which the release of heme from hemopexin is accompanied by a concomitant transfer of heme to the hemopexin receptor or the membrane heme-binding protein (Smith, A., and Morgan, W. T. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 8325-8329)."
https://openalex.org/W1579050066,"A specific cleavage by the reverse transcriptase-associated RNase H activity generates the RNA primer for plus strand DNA synthesis during reverse transcription. Previously, we used site-directed mutagenesis to define the sequence features of the polypurine tract (PPT) required for correct plus strand priming by the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) reverse transcriptase (Rattray, A. J., and Champoux, J. J. (1989) J. Mol. Biol. 208, 445-456). Although the sequences of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and M-MuLV diverge completely outside a 20-base region encompassing the PPT, within this region there are only three differences between the two viruses. Here we show that the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase will utilize the M-MuLV PPT as an origin for plus strand initiation in vitro. This finding enabled us to use the set of PPT mutants previously generated in M-MuLV, in conjunction with a small set of newly derived mutations within the HIV-1 PPT, to study plus strand priming by the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Despite the similarity between the two PPT regions, the sequence features important for positioning RNase H for the cleavage reaction that generates the plus strand primer are different for the two viruses. For M-MuLV, the -7A residue is a critical specificity determinant in the priming reaction, whereas for HIV-1, the -2G and -4G residues play key roles in determining the specificity of priming."
https://openalex.org/W1541842112,"The studies described herein were aimed at defining the mechanism by which 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine 5'-triphosphate (FaraATP), the active intracellular metabolite of fludarabine phosphate, inhibits the synthesis of primer RNA and RNA-primed DNA by the polymerase alpha-primase complex. Incubation of the purified DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex with a poly(dT) template, 500 microM ATP, and increasing concentrations of FaraATP from 2.5 to 50 microM resulted in the progressive accumulation of smaller oligoribonucleotides (2-6 nucleotides) at the expense of the full-length products of DNA primase (7-10 nucleotides). Comparison of the kcat/KM values for incorporation of FaraATP and ATP into oligoribonucleotides revealed that DNA primase incorporated FaraATP 30-fold more efficiently than ATP. FaraAMP was present exclusively at the 3'-termini of the growing primer RNA chains, which prevented further elongation of the primers by DNA primase (primer RNA chain termination). At all FaraATP concentrations tested, inhibition of RNA-primed DNA synthesis was accompanied by primer chain termination. In contrast, DNA polymerase alpha added FaraATP onto full-length primer RNAs about 8-fold less efficiently than dATP, and the incorporation of FaraAMP at the 3'-termini of the primers did not prevent further elongation of these primers by DNA polymerase alpha. These results indicate that primer RNA chain termination is the major effect responsible for the inhibition of RNA-primed DNA synthesis by fludarabine phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1602300034,"B1 and Alu are sequence-homologous interspersed elements of unknown function that have expanded in the genomes of mice and humans, respectively. A minority of B1 and Alu sequences are expressed as small cytoplasmic RNAs. These RNAs have conserved a secondary structure motif also present in signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA despite substantial sequence divergence, whereas random B1 and Alu sequences have not. This RNA structure has also been conserved by the source sequences that gave rise to successive transpositions during B1 and Alu evolution. In the present work small cytoplasmic B1 and Alu RNAs synthesized in vitro were found to bind a cellular protein by mobility shift and UV cross-linking analyses. The mouse and human proteins demonstrate the same specificity to a panel of competitor RNAs. Results using mutated B1 RNA indicate that a single strand loop in the conserved Alu motif is essential for binding. Previous work by Strub et al. (Stub, K., Moss, J. B., and Walter, P. (1991) Mol. Cell. Biol. 11, 3949-3959) demonstrated that the Alu-specific protein SRP 9/14 does not footprint to this region of SRP RNA. This observation coupled with the failure of anti-SRP/9 antibodies to identify SRP 9/14 in the B1 RNA-protein complex as well as the apparent mass and other characteristics of the protein described here suggest that it is a novel B1-Alu RNA-binding protein. Conservation of primary and secondary structure by B1 and Alu small cytoplasmic RNAs as well as features of their specific expression and ability to interact with the conserved binding protein indicate that these RNAs are more homologous than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W1495387478,"Effects of enflurane, an inhalational anesthetic, on NMDA, AMPA, and kainate-gated currents were examined in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing mouse or human brain mRNA. In oocytes expressing mouse mRNA, enflurane at an anesthetic concentration (1.8 mM) inhibited the NMDA-, AMPA-, and kainate-induced currents by 29–40%, 30–33%, and 20–27%, respectively, suggesting that all three glutamate ionotropic receptors are susceptible to suppression by inhalational anesthetics. Furthermore, inhibition by enflurane was independent of the concentrations of the agonists (NMDA, AMPA, and kainate) or the NMDA-coagonist (glycine). This suggests that enflurane inhibition does not result from a competitive interaction at glutamate or glycine binding sites. Enflurane also suppressed the oscillation and apparent desensitization of NMDA currents, suggesting an inhibition of Ca2+ influx through the NMDA channel. In oocytes expressing human brain mRNA, only kainate produced observable currents. Kainate currents of human channels were smaller in size than those of the mouse; however, the kainate concentration-response curve and percent inhibition (27–29%) by enflurane were similar for mice and humans. The results suggest that human and mouse kainate receptors have similar pharmacological characteristics.— Lin, L.-H., Chen, L. L., Harris, R. A.

https://openalex.org/W1573100058,"In cyanobacteria, phycobilisomes are regularly arrayed on the surface of the photosynthetic membranes, and their role is to funnel light energy to the underlying photosystem II reaction center. A model has recently been proposed that ascribes to the so-called LCM, a central role in the building up of the phycobilisome, in addition to its role of terminal energy acceptor (Capuano, V., Braux, A.-S., Tandeau de Marsac, N., and Houmard, J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7239-7247). The phycobilisomes of Calothrix sp. PCC 7601 are typically of the type found in most cyanobacteria. Those of Synechococcus PCC 7942 (or PCC 6301) differ in having central cores made up of two instead of three cylinders. We have integrated the Calothrix PCC 7601 apcE gene that encodes the LCM into the chromosome of a Synechococcus PCC 7942 strain. We have observed that the heterologous gene is expressed and that the corresponding product carries a bilin-type chromophore and can be detected in the phycobilisome fraction of the Synechococcus strain. Moreover, it is shown that, in agreement with our model, this LCM can direct the formation of phycobilisomes that have three-cylinder cores."
https://openalex.org/W1540034352,"Bradykinin (BK) and bombesin (BN) stimulate an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 120-kDa group of proteins (pps120) in Swiss 3T3 cells (Leeb-Lundberg, L. M. F., and Song X.-H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7746-7749). Here, we show that a component of pps120, p125, was specifically immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the p21ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP). The major portion of GAP in nonstimulated cells (96%) was located in the cytosol, and this distribution was not affected by exposure of cells to 1 microM BK for 1 min. A significant amount of GAP in nonstimulated cells was recovered in anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) immunoprecipitates, and the cellular distribution of this GAP essentially paralleled that of total GAP. Recovery of GAP in anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates of nonstimulated cells appeared to be caused at least in part by the presence of GAP complexed to a 190-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (p190). Exposure of cells to 1 microM BK for 1 min resulted in an increase in the recovery of a portion of the cellular GAP in anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates. This increase was paralleled by the appearance of a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein species of 125 kDa (p125) in anti-GAP immunoprecipitates. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p125 was present also in anti-GAP immunoprecipitates after exposure of cells to 1 microM BN. High performance gel exclusion liquid chromatography of the anti-GAP-immunoprecipitated proteins on a Protein-Pak 300SW column revealed that p125 is not GAP. Anti-GAP immunoprecipitation of p125 was prevented by prior denaturation of cell lysates in sodium dodecyl sulfate suggesting that p125 is physically associated with GAP. Chromatography of cell lysates revealed that the pps120 group of tyrosine phosphoproteins includes a 125- and a 120-kDa protein. The anti-GAP-immunoprecipitable p125 migrated identically to the 125-kDa phosphoprotein component of pps120. These observations show that the pps120 group of tyrosine phosphoproteins is composed of at least two physically distinct protein components, p125 and p120. p125 is associated in some manner with a portion of the cellular GAP after exposure of cells to BK and BN."
https://openalex.org/W11075894,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) induced a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a 57-kDa cytoplasmic protein with functional myelin basic protein kinase activity and antigenic properties common to mitogen-activated kinases or extracellular signal-regulated kinases. Basic and acidic FGFs and the diacylglycerol diolein used the same signal transduction pathway to activate pp57. These FGFs, like diolein (Lee, H., Ghose-Dastidar, J., Winawer, S., and Friedman, E. (1993) J. Biol. Chem., 268, 5255-5263), increased the cellular concentration of long-chain diacylglycerols within the same short time period as they increased pp57 tyrosine phosphorylation. Both FGF and diolein increased phosphorylation of pp57 on the same V8 protease-generated fragments, suggesting a common pathway for the phosphorylation of pp57. FGF-induced signal transduction through pp57 mitogen-activated kinase led to cell growth in two undifferentiated colon carcinoma cell lines. In contrast, basic FGF neither increased tyrosine phosphorylation of pp57 nor increased cell growth in two colon goblet cell differentiated lines derived from the same parental line as the undifferentiated cells. Both goblet cell lines exhibited levels of protein-tyrosine kinase activity about one-fifth that of the undifferentiated lines. The decrease in tyrosine kinase activity was not due to down-regulation of FGF receptors or their tyrosine kinase activities. c-src kinase-specific activity was decreased 4-5-fold in both goblet cell lines, suggesting a role for c-src in pp57-mediated signal transduction."
