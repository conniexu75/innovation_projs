https://openalex.org/W2171327609,"Noise, or random fluctuations, in gene expression may produce variability in cellular behavior. To measure the noise intrinsic to eukaryotic gene expression, we quantified the differences in expression of two alleles in a diploid cell. We found that such noise is gene-specific and not dependent on the regulatory pathway or absolute rate of expression. We propose a model in which the balance between promoter activation and transcription influences the variability in messenger RNA levels. To confirm the predictions of our model, we identified both cis - and trans -acting mutations that alter the noise of gene expression. These mutations suggest that noise is an evolvable trait that can be optimized to balance fidelity and diversity in eukaryotic gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2012295774,"Short term high fat feeding in rats results specifically in hepatic fat accumulation and provides a model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in which to study the mechanism of hepatic insulin resistance. Short term fat feeding (FF) caused a ∼3-fold increase in liver triglyceride and total fatty acyl-CoA content without any significant increase in visceral or skeletal muscle fat content. Suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP) by insulin was diminished in the FF group, despite normal basal EGP and insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose disposal. Hepatic insulin resistance could be attributed to impaired insulin-stimulated IRS-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. These changes were associated with activation of PKC-ϵ and JNK1. Ultimately, hepatic fat accumulation decreased insulin activation of glycogen synthase and increased gluconeogenesis. Treatment of the FF group with low dose 2,4-dinitrophenol to increase energy expenditure abrogated the development of fatty liver, hepatic insulin resistance, activation of PKC-ϵ and JNK1, and defects in insulin signaling. In conclusion, these data support the hypothesis hepatic steatosis leads to hepatic insulin resistance by stimulating gluconeogenesis and activating PKC-ϵ and JNK1, which may interfere with tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 and impair the ability of insulin to activate glycogen synthase."

 describe changes that are required if we hope to meet the needs and aspirations of humans while improving the health of our planet9s ecosystems. Problems as diverse as disease transmission and global climate change have benefited substantially from advances in ecology. Such advances have set the stage for emergence of a proactive ecological science in which social and political realities are acknowledged and attention is turned decisively toward the future. The ecological sciences must chart an understanding of how ecosystem services can persist given their extensive human use. Innovative research on the sciences of ecosystem services, ecological restoration, and ecological design must be massively accelerated and must be accompanied by more effective communication of ecological knowledge to society."

To identify and characterize cytokinesis proteins rapidly, we used a functional proteomic and comparative genomic strategy. Midbodies were isolated from mammalian cells, proteins were identified by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT), and protein function was assessed in Caenorhabditis elegans . Of 172 homologs disrupted by RNA interference, 58% displayed defects in cleavage furrow formation or completion, or germline cytokinesis. Functional dissection of the midbody demonstrated the importance of lipid rafts and vesicle trafficking pathways in cytokinesis, and the utilization of common membrane cytoskeletal components in diverse morphogenetic events in the cleavage furrow, the germline, and neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2067598924,"The coordinated and reciprocal action of serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinases and phosphatases produces transient phosphorylation, a fundamental regulatory mechanism for many biological processes. The human genome encodes a far greater number of Ser/Thr protein kinases than of phosphatases. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), in particular, is ubiquitously distributed and regulates a broad range of cellular functions, including glycogen metabolism, cell-cycle progression and muscle relaxation1,2. PP1 has evolved effective catalytic machinery but lacks substrate specificity. Substrate specificity is conferred upon PP1 through interactions with a large number of regulatory subunits. The regulatory subunits are generally unrelated, but most possess the RVxF motif, a canonical PP1-binding sequence. Here we reveal the crystal structure at 2.7 Å resolution of the complex between PP1 and a 34-kDa N-terminal domain of the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit MYPT1. MYPT1 is the protein that regulates PP1 function in smooth muscle relaxation3. Structural elements amino- and carboxy-terminal to the RVxF motif of MYPT1 are positioned in a way that leads to a pronounced reshaping of the catalytic cleft of PP1, contributing to the increased myosin specificity of this complex. The structure has general implications for the control of PP1 activity by other regulatory subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2016996307,"The β1 integrin, functioning as a mechanoreceptor, senses a mechanical stimulus generated during collagen matrix contraction and down-regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt survival signal triggering apoptosis. The identities of integrin-associated signal molecules in the focal adhesion complex that are responsible for propagating β1 integrin viability signals in response to collagen matrix contraction are not known. Here we show that in response to collagen contraction focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is dephosphorylated. In contrast, enforced activation of β1 integrin by anti-β1 integrin antibody, which protects fibroblasts from apoptosis, preserves FAK phosphorylation. We demonstrate that ligation of β1 integrin by type I collagen or by enforced activation of β1 integrin by antibody promotes phosphorylation of FAK, p85 subunit of PI3K, and serine 473 of Akt. Wortmannin inhibited Akt but not FAK phosphorylation in response to enforced activation of β1 integrin by antibody. Blocking FAK by pharmacologic inhibition or by dominant negative FAK attenuated phosphorylation of p85 subunit of PI3K and Akt. Dominant negative FAK augmented fibroblast apoptosis during collagen contraction, and this was associated with diminished Akt activity.

Our data identify a novel role for FAK, functioning upstream of PI3K/Akt, in transducing a β1 integrin viability signal in collagen matrices. Integrins are cell surface adhesion receptors that regulate cell viability in response to cues derived from the extracellular matrix (1Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. Tumor Biol. 1996; 17: 117-124Google Scholar). The nature of these extracellular cues that regulate cell viability are diverse. In the case of polarized epithelial and endothelial cells, whose basal surface is attached to the basement membrane, direct loss of integrin-matrix interaction can trigger anoikis (3Meredith Jr., J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Google Scholar, 4Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Google Scholar, 5Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1973-1987Google Scholar). In the case of mesenchymal cells, which exist encompassed by the extracellular matrix, matrix-derived mechanical stimuli can regulate viability. In this latter scenario, integrins function as mechanoreceptors that detect mechanical stimuli originating from the extracellular matrix and convert them to chemical signals that regulate cell viability pathways (6Tian B.

For example, fibroblast survival in type I collagen matrices is regulated by integrin-extracellular matrix interactions (6Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Google Scholar). In response to contraction of type I collagen matrices fibroblasts undergo apoptosis (6Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Google Scholar, 13Grinnell F. Zhu M. Carlson M.A. Abrams J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 608-619Google Scholar, 14Fluck J. Querfeld C. Cremer A. Niland S. Krieg T. Sollberg S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 153-157Google Scholar). During the process of collagen contraction Akt becomes dephosphorylated (6Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Google Scholar). This down-regulation of Akt activity during collagen contraction is mediated by β1 integrin. Up-regulation of Akt activity, either by enforced activation of β1 integrin by anti-β1 integrin antibody or by ectopic expression of constitutively active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; SH2, Src homology 2; FRNK, dominant negative FAK; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Ad, adenovirus; RV, retrovirus; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling; CA, constitutively active; PP2, PP3, pyrazolopyrimidine 2 and 3, respectively; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10. protects fibroblasts from collagen gel contraction-induced apoptosis (6Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Google Scholar). Therefore, functioning as a mechanoreceptor, the β1 integrin is capable of sensing a matrix-derived mechanical stimulus and regulates fibroblast survival by modulating a PI3K/Akt survival pathway. Matrix-derived mechanical stimuli can be transmitted through the direct or indirect interaction of integrins with associated lipid or protein signaling molecules in the focal adhesion complex (15Plopper G.E. McNamee H.P. Dike L.E. Bojanowski K. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1349-1365Google Scholar, 16Chicurel M.E. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 232-239Google Scholar). Currently the identities of integrin-associated signaling molecules that are responsible for propagating the β1 integrin viability signal via PI3K/Akt in response to collagen matrix-derived mechanical signals are unclear. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a potential candidate signaling molecule, has been shown to be capable of regulating integrin-mediated survival signaling (17Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Google Scholar, 18Crouch D.H. Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2689-2696Google Scholar, 19Hadden H.L. Henke C.A. Am. J. Respir.

However, the downstream signaling pathways that mediate integrin-FAK survival signaling are diverse, and the factors determining which pathway is utilized remain obscure. Downstream signal pathways implicated in FAK viability signaling include a c-Jun N-terminal kinase survival pathway that inactivates the tumor suppressor protein p53-regulated cell death pathway (23Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Google Scholar), death-associated protein kinase (24Wang W.J. Kuo J.C. Yao C.C. Chen R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 169-179Google Scholar), and the PI3K/Akt pathway regulating epithelial and endothelial cell viability (22Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Google Scholar, 25Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Google Scholar). Data supporting a role for FAK in the β1 integrin/PI3K/Akt viability pathway include the finding that integrin-extracellular matrix interaction recruits FAK to the focal adhesion complex and activates it. Integrin ligation and clustering activates FAK by autophosphorylation of tyrosine 397. This creates a potential binding site for the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of PI3K (26Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Google Scholar, 27Eliceiri B.P. Puente X.S. Hood J.D. Stupack D.G. Schlaepfer D.D. Huang X.Z. Sheppard D. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 149-159Google Scholar, 28Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K by FAK may activate the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K and the PI3K/Akt signal pathway. Although it is plausible that FAK regulates fibroblast survival within a three-dimensional collagen matrix via the β1 integrin/PI3K/Akt signal pathway, the role of FAK in this process has not been examined. In this study we show that in response to collagen matrix contraction FAK is dephosphorylated. In contrast, enforced activation of β1 integrin by anti-β1 integrin antibody, which protects fibroblasts from collagen contraction-induced apoptosis, preserves FAK phosphorylation. We demonstrate that ligation of β1 integrin with type I collagen or enforced activation of β1 integrin by anti-β1 integrin antibody promotes the phosphorylation of FAK, the p85 subunit of PI3K, and serine 473 of Akt. Blocking FAK function by pharmacologic inhibition or by dominant negative FAK inhibits both the phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K and serine 473 of Akt. Furthermore dominant negative FAK promotes fibroblast apoptosis in both anoikis and collagen gel assays. Conversely constitutively active FAK augments p85 phosphorylation and Akt activity and protects fibroblasts from collagen gel contraction-induced apoptosis. Our data identify a novel role for FAK functioning upstream of PI3K and Akt in mediating β1 integrin viability signaling of fibroblasts in collagen matrices. Cell Culture—Human lung fibroblasts (CCL-210, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and used between passages 9 and 11. Antibodies and Reagents—Mouse monoclonal antibody P5D2 (raised against the human β1 integrin subunit) was provided by Dr. Leo Furcht (University of Minnesota). Polyclonal anti-Akt antibody and anti-phosphorylated Akt antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal anti-FAK was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-FAK antibodies directed to tyrosine 397, 407, 576, 577, 861, or 925 were from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Anti-PI3K-p85 subunit antibody and anti-phosphorylated tyrosine antibody Py20 were from BD Transduction Laboratories. Wortmannin was from Sigma, and PP2 and PP3 were from Calbiochem. Dominant Negative FAK cDNA Construct—Dominant negative FAK (FRNK) was generated by amplification of the cDNA FRNK encoding sequence of FAK obtained from human lung fibroblasts by reverse transcription-PCR (29Mortier E. Cornelissen F. van Hove C. Dillen L. Richardson A. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 901-909Google Scholar). The primers used to generate dominant negative FAK were: 5′-CAG CAC AAT ATC GAT CAG CAA GAA GAG CAC-3′ and 5′-CGC CAC ATT TTG GAT CCT GGA TT-3′. A ClaI restriction site was introduced at the beginning of 5′-FRNK. Both IRES-GFP (pIRES2-EGFP vector from Clontech) and FRNK were cloned into the pBluescript II KS vector. FRNK-IRES-GFP was then inserted into the SwaI site in vector pAxCAwt (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) to generate recombinant adenovirus. Recombinant adenoviruses with FRNK-GFP and IRES-GFP (Ad-FRNK and Ad-GFP) were made according to the company's instruction. Adenovirus with IRES-GFP only (Ad-GFP) served as a control. Adenovirus titers were analyzed by the agarose plaque method. Constitutively Active FAK Construct—Constitutively active FAK (CD2-FAK) in the pCDM8 vector was a gift from Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seattle, WA. A unique NotI restriction site was introduced at the beginning of 5′-CD2-FAK in the pCDM8 vector by PCR. The primers used to generate the restriction site were 5′-TCA CAG GTC AGG GTT GTG TT-3′ and 5′-ATC GCG GCC GCT TCT AGA GAT CCC TCG-3′. The CD2-FAK fragment from the pCDM8 vector and IRES-GFP from the pIRES2-GFP vector were subcloned into the NotI-SalI in the pBluescript II KS vector. Next the CD2-FAK-IRES-GFP fragment cut by NotI and SalI from the pBluescript II KS vector was cloned into the BglII and SalI site in the amphotropic retrovirus expression vector MIGR1.str. The resulting plasmid MIGR1-CD2FAKGFP and retrovirus genomic plasmid PCL were cotransfected into H-293 cells using a calcium phosphate precipitation method to produce the replication-defective recombinant retrovirus, retrovirus-CD2-FAKGFP (RV-CD2-FAK). Retrovirus-GFP (RV-GFP) served as a control. In addition, the fragment of CD2-FAK and IRES-GFP was cloned into the SwaI site in the vector pAxCAwt to generate the recombinant adenovirus Ad-CD2-FAK according to the manufacturer's instruction. Constitutively Active p110 Subunit of PI3K Construct—Dr. Julian Downward provided the constitutively active p110 subunit of PI3K. CA-p110 was subcloned into the retroviral vector MIGR1.str containing IRES-GFP, creating the bicistronic construct CA-p110/IRES-GFP as described previously (6Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Google Scholar). A population of CA-p110/GFP-positive cells was obtained by cell sorting using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Adenoviral and Retroviral Infection—Human lung fibroblasts were plated in tissue culture dishes and infected with Ad-GFP, Ad-FRNK, and Ad-CD2-FAK at a multiplicity of infection of 1:50 for 12 h or with RV-GFP and RV-CD2FAK for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum. After infection the medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the cells were serum-starved for 48 h prior to performing the individual experiments. After 48 h of serum starvation the cells were ready to be used for different treatments with anti-β1 integrin antibody (P5D2, 6 μg/ml) or various reagents (wortmannin, 200 nm; PP2 or PP3, 10 μm). Immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis—Fibroblasts were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm Na2P2O7, 1 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were precleared for 60 min at 4 °C with protein G-coupled agarose beads and immunoprecipitated overnight (16 h) at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody. Western analysis of human lung fibroblasts was performed as described previously (6Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Google Scholar). Briefly equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were subjected to 8-10% SDS-PAGE and transferred (45 min, 24 V) to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 containing 6% nonfat dry milk; incubated with the primary antibody; washed; and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The membranes were developed using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Anoikis Assay—Anoikis assays were performed as described by Frisch and Francis (4Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Google Scholar). Tissue culture plates were coated twice with poly-HEME (10 mg/ml in ethanol, Sigma) and rinsed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. Fibroblasts resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were plated on the poly-HEME plates. At the indicated times, the cells in suspension were recovered and analyzed by fluorescence TUNEL assay. TUNEL Assay—Fibroblasts recovered from anoikis assays and type I collagen gels were analyzed for apoptosis using an in situ cell death detection kit (fluorescence TUNEL assay, Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly recovered cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 60 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in TUNEL reaction mixture, incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, washed, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (30Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Google Scholar). Collagen Gel Assay—Collagen gels were prepared as described previously (6Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Google Scholar). Human lung fibroblasts (1.2 × 105) were resuspended in 2.0 ml of 1.5× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Vitrogen (3 mg/ml; Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA) was added to the cell suspension to achieve a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The cell/collagen solution was incubated in a water bath for 10 min at 37 °C, poured into 3.5-cm uncoated plastic dishes, and placed in a cell culture incubator at 10% CO2 and 37 °C where the gels polymerized in ∼30-60 min. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Experiments were performed three times. For assessment of the percentage of apoptotic cells within collagen gels or on dishes coated with poly-HEME using the TUNEL assay, microscopic analysis of at least 200 cells/slide was performed. Paired evaluations were made for experimental and control conditions within each experiment, and significance was determined by Student's t test. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. Collagen Matrix Contraction Is Associated with FAK Dephosphorylation—Regulation of fibroblast viability in collagen matrices is mediated by the β1 integrin and involves a PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. In response to type I collagen matrix contraction, Akt becomes dephosphorylated triggering fibroblast apoptosis. Previous studies have implicated FAK with β1 integrin viability signaling; therefore we were interested in determining the effect of collagen matrix contraction on FAK activity. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 397 of FAK has been used as a marker of FAK activity. We examined phosphorylation of tyrosine 397 of FAK as a function of time in contractile collagen gels. During the first 2-4 h after fibroblasts have been incorporated into type I collagen matrices but before contraction begins, the cells attach and spread. During this time period FAK became phosphorylated (Fig. 1). However, as matrix contraction progresses the cells become increasingly round in appearance (6Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Google Scholar). By 24 h the gels have contracted, and many of the cells are undergoing apoptosis (6Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Google Scholar). At the 24-h time point we found that FAK was dephosphorylated. Therefore, in conjunction with our previous finding that Akt becomes dephosphorylated during matrix contraction, these data suggested a link between FAK and Akt activity and regulation of fibroblast viability in collagen matrices. We have found previously that enforced activation of β1 integrin by P5D2 anti-β1 integrin antibody protects fibroblasts from collagen contraction-induced apoptosis by augmenting Akt phosphorylation/activity (6Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the effect of P5D2 antibody treatment on FAK phosphorylation during collagen matrix contraction. Fibroblasts were incorporated into contractile collagen gels. The cells were allowed to attach and spread for 2 h in the gels after which time P5D2 antibody was added to the collagen gels as described previously (6Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Google Scholar). The effect on FAK phosphorylation was assessed at various times. At the 4- and 6-h time points, phosphorylation of tyrosine 397 of FAK in contractile collagen gels treated with P5D2 antibody was similar to that found in control contractile gels. It should be noted that at these time points little collagen contraction had occurred. However, at the 24-h time point when the gels have largely completed contraction, the level of FAK phosphorylation was preserved in contractile collagen gels treated with P5D2 antibody compared with control contractile gels (Fig. 1). This suggests that the protection of fibroblasts from collagen contraction-induced apoptosis in response to enforced activation of β1 integrin by antibody involves FAK. FAK Phosphorylation and Akt Activity Increase as a Function of Ligation of β1Integrin with Type I Collagen or by Enforced Activation of β1Integrin by Anti-β1Integrin Antibody—To further examine whether FAK plays a role in integrin-mediated survival signaling in collagen matrices, we evaluated the effect of culturing fibroblasts on collagen-coated plates on FAK phosphorylation and Akt activity. Human lung fibroblasts were serum-starved for 48 h and then plated on tissue culture plastic dishes coated with type I collagen. Phosphorylation of serine 473 of Akt was used to assess Akt activity (31Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Google Scholar). Akt phosphorylation increased as a function of time as the fibroblasts were allowed to adhere and spread on type I collagen (Fig. 2A). To examine whether the increase in Akt activity was dependent upon β1 integrin interaction with type I collagen, we examined the effect of blocking β1 integrin-type I collagen interaction on Akt activity using anti-β1 integrin antibody. When cells in suspension are preincubated with P5D2 antibody prior to plating on type I collagen, the anti-β1 integrin antibody functions as an inhibitor, blocking integrin-collagen interaction (6Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Google Scholar). Preincubation of fibroblasts with antibody prior to plating on type I collagen abrogated the increase in Akt activity (Fig. 2A). We next examined whether the β1 integrin-mediated increase in Akt activity associated with ligation of type I collagen was dependent upon PI3K. Serum-starved fibroblasts were pretreated with wortmannin prior to plating on type I collagen-coated dishes. Inhibition of PI3K by wortmannin attenuated the increase in Akt activity associated with β1 integrin-type I collagen interaction (data not shown). These data indicate that β1 integrin-type I collagen interaction promotes Akt activity in a PI3K-dependent manner. The effect of plating fibroblasts on collagen-coated dishes on FAK phosphorylation was also examined. Human lung fibroblasts were serum-starved for 48 h and then plated on type I collagen-coated dishes. Similar to Akt activity, FAK phosphorylation increased as a function of time as the fibroblasts were allowed to adhere and spread on type I collagen (Fig. 2B). To examine whether the increase in FAK phosphorylation was dependent upon β1 integrin-type I collagen interaction, we examined the effect of preincubating fibroblasts with anti-β1 integrin antibody on FAK phosphorylation. Inhibition of β1 integrin-type I collagen interaction by anti-β1 integrin antibody abrogated the increase in FAK phosphorylation associated with plating the cells on type I collagen (Fig. 2B). We have shown previously that enforced activation of β1 integrin by adding P5D2 β1 integrin monoclonal antibody to adherent fibroblasts increases Akt activity in a PI3K-dependent fashion (Ref. 6Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Google Scholar; see also Fig. 3C). Under these culture conditions, the P5D2 anti-β1 integrin antibody functions in an agonist fashion. Therefore, to perform these experiments fibroblasts were plated on tissue culture dishes and serum-starved prior to addition of anti-β1 integrin antibody. Consistent with the results obtained when integrin was ligated by type I collagen, we found that enforced activation of β1 integrin by P5D2 antibody also increased FAK phosphorylation in serum-starved fibroblasts adhered to tissue culture dishes (Fig. 3A). We next assessed which FAK phosphorylation sites were phosphorylated upon ligation of β1 integrin with P5D2 antibody by immunoblotting lysates of P5D2 antibody-treated cells with a panel of phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies. These antibodies recognize the tyrosine-phosphorylated state of amino acid 397, 407, 576, 577, 861, or 925 of FAK. Ligation of β1 integrin with P5D2 antibody increased the phosphorylation of tyrosines 397 and 407 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation of the other tyrosine residues within FAK were either only slightly increased or not increased at all. Because ligation of β1 integrin with type I collagen or P5D2 anti-β1 integrin antibody phosphorylates FAK, we sought to determine whether ligation of β1 integrin promotes the association of FAK with β1 integrin. Lysates of serum-starved fibroblasts treated with P5D2 antibody were immunoprecipitated using anti-β1 integrin antibody and probed for the presence of FAK or vice versa. A direct physical association between integrin and FAK could not be demonstrated in response to enforced activation of β1 integrin by anti-β1 integrin antibody (data not shown). Phosphorylation of tyrosine 397 of FAK may provide a binding site for the Src homology 2 domains of the p85 subunit of PI3K (31Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Google Scholar). Since enforced activation of β1 integrin by anti-β1 integrin antibody promotes the phosphorylation of tyrosine 397 of FAK, we sought to determine whether ligation of β1 integrin by antibody also promoted the association of FAK with PI3K. Immunoprecipitation of FAK and immunoblotting for the p85 subunit of PI3K or vice versa did not demonstrate a direct physical association of FAK with the p85 subunit of PI3K. However, we found that enforced activation of β1 integrin with anti-β1 integrin antibody promoted phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). For these experiments, serum-starved adherent fibroblasts were treated with P5D2 antibody for various times. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PI3K-p85 antibody. Phosphorylation of p85 subunit was assessed using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and Western analysis. Although we were unable to demonstrate a direct physical association of integrin with FAK or FAK with PI3K, our results suggest a link between ligation of β1 integrin and activation of FAK, PI3K, and Akt. These data support the concept that FAK may play a role in β1 integrin/PI3K/Akt survival signaling on collagen matrices. The above data indicate that ligation of β1 integrin by either type I collagen or by enforced activation of β1 integrin by antibody increases FAK, PI3K, and Akt activity. We were also interested in determining what effect blocking integrin-mediated FAK phosphorylation would have on PI3K and Akt activity. To begin to approach this issue we used PP2, a selective Src kinase family inhibitor. By virtue of its ability to inhibit Src kinases, PP2 has been shown to block integrin-induced FAK phosphorylation (32Salazar E.P. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17788-17795Google Scholar). We found that PP2 effectively abolished the phosphorylation of tyrosine 397 of FAK, the p85 subunit of PI3K, and serine 473 of Akt (Fig. 4) that occurs upon enforced activation of β1 integrin by anti-β1 integrin antibody. In contrast, PP3, an inactive analog of PP2, had no effect. These results suggest a possible link between integrin-induced FAK phosphorylation and activation of PI3K and Akt. Down-regulation of FAK Activity Inhibits the Phosphorylation of FAK, the p85 Subunit of PI3K, and Akt—These studies strongly suggested to us that FAK activity might be involved in regulating PI3K/Akt survival signaling in response to collagen matrix contraction. To investigate this further, we examined the effect of FRNK on phosphorylation of Akt to determine whether FAK is required for the activation of Akt in response to ligation of β1 integrin by collagen and anti-β1 integrin antibody. We first examined whether dominant negative FAK would inhibit FAK phosphorylation induced by β1 integrin-type I collagen interaction and by enforced activation of β1 integrin by P5D2 antibody. Human lung fibroblasts were infected with either Ad-FRNK or Ad-GFP (empty vector control). The cells were then serum-starved for 48 h and then either plated on tissue culture dishes coated with"

Exposure of cells to oxidative and ethanol stresses caused large increases in protein sumoylation. A large number of new sumoylated proteins were identified in untreated, hydrogen peroxide-treated, and ethanol-treated cells. These proteins are known to be involved in diverse cellular processes, including gene transcription, protein translation, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, metabolic processes, and stress responses. Additionally, the known enzymes, including E1, E2, and E3 of the sumoylation cascade were found to be auto-sumoylated.

Taken together, these results show that protein sumoylation is broadly involved in many cellular functions and this mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach is useful in studying the regulation of protein sumoylation in the cells. Protein ubiquitination is well known to be involved in protein degradation through the proteasome and intracellular protein sorting (1Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Google Scholar, 3Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Google Scholar). A family of ubiquitin-like proteins has also been identified to be attached to substrate proteins through enzymatic processes similar to that of ubiquitination (4Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Google Scholar, 5Schwartz D.C. Hochstrasser M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 321-328Google Scholar, 6Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Google Scholar). However, the function of these ubiquitin-like proteins is unclear. Among them, SUMO, 1The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HA, hemagglutinin-derived epitope; DTT, dithiothreitol; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. a small ubiquitin-like modifier, is the most widely studied to date. In mammals, SUMO was first identified to be conjugated to substrate protein such as Ran-GAP1 (7Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Google Scholar, 8Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Google Scholar). The Smt3 gene, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is essential for cell viability and is the only budding yeast homolog of mammalian SUMO. Smt3 was originally identified as a suppressor of Mif2 mutation, and its function in the nucleus has been suggested (9Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 793-807Google Scholar). With an approach similar to that used in the identification of ubiquitination enzymes, the enzymes of protein sumoylation in budding yeast were identified (10Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Google Scholar, 11Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Google Scholar). In the yeast S. cerevisiae, Smt3 is first proteolytically processed to expose its Gly-Gly repeat at the C terminus by a SUMO-specific protease, Ulp1 (12Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Google Scholar). In an ATP-dependent reaction, the C terminus of mature Smt3 forms a thioester bond with the cysteine residue at the active site of the E1 enzyme, which is a heterodimeric Aos1/Uba2 complex (10Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Google Scholar). Through a trans-esterification reaction, Smt3 is transferred to the SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme Ubc9, and the C terminus of Smt3 forms a thioester bond with the active site cysteine residue of Ubc9 (11Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Google Scholar). In the presence or absence of E3 SUMO ligases, the C terminus of Smt3 is then covalently attached to lysine residue of substrate proteins via formation of a stable isopeptide bond. In yeast, two SUMO E3 ligases were identified and are known as Siz1 and Siz2 (13Takahashi Y. Kahyo T. Toh-E A. Yasuda H. Kikuchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48973-48977Google Scholar, 14Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Google Scholar). No other E3 enzyme for Smt3 in the budding yeast has been identified. A number of SUMO substrate proteins have also been identified in yeast, and these include the septin components, PCNA/Pol30 and Top2 (15Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Google Scholar, 16Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Google Scholar, 17Bachant J. Alcasabas A. Blat Y. Kleckner N. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1169-1182Google Scholar). However, the function of protein sumoylation remains unclear, and questions remain about whether sumoylation plays a broad role in regulating cellular functions like the ubiquitination pathway. In mammals, a larger number of sumoylated proteins have been identified, and most are involved in nuclear processes such as gene transcription (18Sapetschnig A. Rischitor G. Braun H. Doll A. Schergaut M. Melchior F. Suske G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5206-5215Google Scholar, 19Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Del Sal G.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1043-1054Google Scholar). Yeast is a very useful model organism, because it allows both facile genetic and biochemical studies. Yet only a limited number of sumoylated proteins in yeast have been found so far (15Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Google Scholar, 16Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Google Scholar, 17Bachant J. Alcasabas A. Blat Y. Kleckner N. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1169-1182Google Scholar). Identification of new sumoylated proteins in yeast would immediately reveal the cellular processes in which protein sumoylation plays a role. In addition, it could lead to new target proteins in which the function of sumoylation could be studied in detail. With these goals, we undertook a global analysis of sumoylated proteins in yeast cells under various cell growth conditions. This has revealed the autosumoylation of the enzymes involved in protein sumoylation. Furthermore, the newly identified sumoylation substrates have revealed many diverse cellular processes in which sumoylation plays a role. Materials—Expression plasmid pYES2/NT was from Invitrogen. Plasmid pFA6a-3HA-kanMX6 was obtained from Mark Longtine (21Longtine M.S. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Google Scholar). Yeast was grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) or in synthetic minimal defined medium with appropriate sugar at 30 °C. Ni+-NTA resin was from Qiagen; anti-FLAG antibody and conjugated-agarose were from Sigma. Anti-HA antibody and anti-HA affinity matrix were from Roche Applied Science. Protease inhibitor mixture for purification of histidine-tagged proteins was from Sigma. Plasmid Construction—The S. cerevisiae SMT3 gene was obtained by PCR using yeast genomic DNA as template, then cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pYES2/NT plasmid. The Xpress epitope in pYES2/NT was mutated to the FLAG epitope, generating pYES-6HisFLAG-SMT3 plasmid, which contains Smt3 with an N-terminal extension MGGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDYKDDDDKVPGS. The pYES-2HA-SMT3 plasmid was created by replacing the 6HisFLAG tag in the pYES-6HisFLAG-SMT3 plasmid with two copies of HA epitope (amino acid sequence: MGYPYDVPDYAGSYPYDVPDYAGVPGS). To make pFA6a-6HisFLAG-KanMX6 plasmid for C-terminal tagging of genes of interest, the 3HA tag in pFA6a-3HA-kanMX6 plasmid was replaced by the 6HisFLAG tag (amino acid sequence: GGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDYKDDDDKVPGSSVVE), yielding the pFA6a-6HisFLAG-kanMX6 plasmid. DNA sequences in these plasmids were verified by sequencing. Genetic Methods Used in the Yeast S. cerevisiae—To tag the SMT3 gene with 6HisFLAG at the N terminus chromosomal locus, the DNA sequence of 6HisFLAG-SMT3 from the above pYES-6HisFLAG-SMT3 plasmid was subcloned into the pFA6a-3HA-kanMX6 plasmid, generating the pFA6a-6HisFLAG-SMT3-kanMX6 plasmid. The chromosomal SMT3 was then replaced by 6HisFLAG-SMT3 through PCR-based homologous recombination. The forward primer sequence was 5′-GGACAGAAGGACCCAGTTCAGTTCTAGTTTTACAAATAAATACACGAGCGatggggggttctcatcatcat, and the reverse primer sequence was 5′-TGGGGGGAAGGGAGAGGTTTGTTGGCGTTTTTTAGGCATTGTTAAGAGTCgcagatgatgtcgaggcg. Uppercase letters in the primers correspond to 50 bp immediately upstream and downstream of SMT3 in the chromosome, respectively. Using PCR-based homologous recombination and pFA6a-6HisFLAG-KanMX6 as template, we tagged a few of the candidate sumoylated proteins at their C termini by using the 6HisFLAG epitope. The yeast SOD1 gene was cloned into the pFA6a-kanMX6 plasmid, resulting in pFA6a-Sod1-kanMX6 plasmid from which mutation of a specific lysine residue of Sod1 was carried out. The chromosomal SOD1 was then replaced with mutant SOD1 through homologous recombination. Correct integration of the epitope tag in each case was verified by DNA sequencing. All the yeast strains and their relevant genotypes are listed in Table I.Table IThe yeast S. cerevisiae strains used in this studyNameGenotypeSourceBY4741MATahis3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0ATCCHZY1017MATahis3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 6HisFLAG-smt3::kanMX6This studyHZY1205MATahis3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 elp5-6HisFLAG::kanMX6This studyHZY1206MATahis3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 sod1-6HisFLAG::kanMX6This studyHZY1207MATahis3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 pol30-6HisFLAG::kanMX6This study Open table in a new tab Purification of Sumoylated Proteins in Yeast—Two liters of HZY1017 cells were grown in YPD and harvested at log phase (A600 ∼ 1) by centrifugation. Collected cells were broken by glass beads using a beads-beater in denatured lysis buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 8 m urea, and protease inhibitor mix). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was incubated with 2 ml of Ni+-NTA resin for 1 h and then loaded onto a column. The resin was first washed by denatured wash buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris·HCl, 8 m urea, pH 6.3), then washed by cold native wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0). Proteins were eluted by using 10 ml of cold elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) and mixed with 100 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose. After incubating for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed by PBST (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20), then washed by water to remove salt. Lastly, the sumoylated proteins were eluted with 1% acetic acid, then dried. Purification of Sumoylated Sod1—Six liters of HZY1206 cells, transformed with pYES-2HA-SMT3 plasmid, were grown in HSM-ura dropout media (Qbiogene) with 1% raffinose. At A600 ∼ 0.6, galactose was added to a final concentration of 1%; cells were grown for an additional 4 h. The cells were harvested then broken by glass beads in ice-cold native lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was incubated with 4 ml of Ni+-NTA resin for 1 h at 4 °C then washed with native wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0). His6-FLAG-tagged Sod1 was eluted by 20 ml of elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0). The volume of the eluted fraction was reduced to 5 ml by an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (Millipore), then mixed with 50 μl of anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science). After incubating for 2 h at 4 °C, the anti-HA affinity matrix was washed three times with PBST. Sumoylated Sod1 was eluted by boiling the resin two times with 50 μl of 0.1% SDS. The volume of the elution was brought up to 0.6 ml by adding PBST to dilute the SDS, then mixed with 50 μl of anti-FLAG agarose for further purification as described above. The sumoylated Sod1 was eluted by 1% acetic acid and dried. Protein Techniques—Proteins were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT, boiled for 5 min, then loaded onto a 4–12% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked by TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl) containing 2.5% dry milk, and incubated with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane was then washed three times with TBST (TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of the anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The membrane was washed and then developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Unless otherwise specified, ECL was always used in the Western blot analyses. In some instances, anti-mouse secondary antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) was used, and the membrane was developed in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-1-phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma). Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Purified protein was either subjected to in-solution digestion or in-gel digestion. For in-solution digestion, dried sample was resuspended in 20 μlof6 m urea, and 100 μl of 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, was added to dilute the urea to 1 m. Trypsin was then added to the solution for overnight digestion. In-gel digestion was done according to a standard procedure (22Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Shevchenko A. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were analyzed by microcapillary reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography microelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. A 100-μm × 10-cm fused silica capillary column in-house packed with the C18 resin (Michrom Bio-Resources) was used, and the flow rate was typically 250 nl/min. COMET, a software package originally developed by the Institute for Systems Biology, was used in data analysis (23Han D.K. Eng J. Zhou H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 946-951Google Scholar). Identification of Sumoylated Proteins in Yeast Cells Grown in YPD—To facilitate purification of sumoylated proteins in yeast, we first replaced the chromosomal SMT3 gene by N-terminal 6HisFLAG-tagged SMT3, yielding the strain HZY1017. Several observations suggest that replacing the SMT3 gene by 6HisFLAG-SMT3 does not affect protein sumoylation events in yeast cells. First, Smt3 is essential for cell viability. We observed no difference in cell growth comparing WT cells and HZY1017 cells. 2W. Zhou, J. J. Ryan, and H. Zhou, unpublished observation. In addition, it is well known that the C terminus of Smt3 is processed and covalently attached to the lysine residues of substrate proteins. N-terminal epitope-tagged Smt3 in a plasmid has been widely used for analysis of protein sumoylation, and its attachment to substrate proteins does not appear to be affected (11Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Google Scholar, 15Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Google Scholar). Second, as shown in Fig. 1, the sumoylation pattern in HZY1017 cells closely resembles those found by others using anti-Smt3 antibody (12Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Google Scholar, 14Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that the sumoylation process in the 6HisFLAG-Smt3 cell is unaffected by protein tagging. The sumoylated proteins from the HZY1017 cells were purified by tandem affinity purification under denaturing condition as described in the experimental procedure above. The results are shown in Fig. 2. The high molecular weight sumoylated proteins (around 100 kDa) in Fig. 1 are likely septins (15Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Google Scholar). Septins tend to form aggregates during purification and lead to variable amount of their recovery. 2W. Zhou, J. J. Ryan, and H. Zhou, unpublished observation. As shown in Fig. 2, thirteen silver-staining bands corresponding to those positive bands in the anti-FLAG Western blot were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. The peptides were extracted from the gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Tryptic peptides from Smt3 were found in each band. In addition, a number of sumoylated protein candidates were identified (see Table II). Because covalent attachment of Smt3 (15 kDa) to a substrate protein is expected to add to its apparent molecular mass by at least 15 kDa, comparison of the observed molecular weight of a candidate SUMO substrate to its theoretical molecular weight provides an immediate indication on whether it is a likely sumoylated substrate. Based on this criterion, and the fact that Smt3 peptides were found in all of these bands, all of these candidate proteins are likely to be sumoylated proteins.Table IISumoylated proteins identified in yeast cells grown in YPDBand analyzedObserved molecular mass on SDS-PAGEProteins identified (expected molecular mass)kDa140Smt3 (15), Ubc9 (18), and Sod1 (16)248Smt3 (15) and Mrp8 (25)352Smt3 (15) and Ipp1 (32)455Smt3 (15), Elp5 (35), and Tdh3 (36)560Smt3 (15), Aos1 (39), and Fba1 (40)665Smt3 (15), Tif2 (45), and Tef2 (50)768Smt3 (15), Tif2 (45), and Rpa49 (47)870Smt3 (15) and Pgk1 (45)975Smt3 (15) and Pgi1 (61)1085Smt3 (15) and Uba2 (71)1190Smt3 (15) and Uba2 (71)12100Smt3 (15) and Cdc3 (60)13110Smt3 (15), Cdc3 (60), and Eft2 (93) Open table in a new tab Verification of Sumoylation of Elp5 and Sod1—We asked whether some of these candidate proteins in Table II could be verified by methods other than mass spectrometry. Elp5 is one subunit of a six-subunit Elongator Complex that associates with the elongating form of RNA polymerase II (24Krogan N.J. Greenblatt J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8203-8212Google Scholar). To verify Elp5 as a sumoylated substrate, the C-terminal 6HisFLAG-tagged Elp5 cells were transformed with pYES-2HA-Smt3 plasmid. Tagged Elp5 was purified by Ni+-NTA resin under denaturing conditions and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation. The purified Elp5 was readily detected by anti-FLAG (Fig. 3A), whereas the sumoylated Elp5 was detected by anti-HA (Fig. 3B). The sumoylated Elp5 appears in the exact same region as in Fig. 2, which was originally identified by mass spectrometry. The relatively faint upper band in Fig. 3A detected by anti-FLAG appears to coincide with the sumoylated Elp5 revealed by anti-HA in Fig. 3B. It thus appears that stoichiometrically, the sumoylation of Elp5 is fairly low. We also purified Elp5 under native conditions, in which Elp4 and Elp6 of the elongator complex were copurified; however, only Elp5 was found to be sumoylated.2 To verify the sumoylation of Sod1 in yeast, C-terminal 6HisFLAG-tagged Sod1 was purified from cells transformed with 2HA-Smt3. As shown in Fig. 3C, when the purified Sod1 was detected by anti-FLAG, an additional faint band corresponding to the molecular weight of sumoylated Sod1 could be seen. When the same purified protein sample was detected by anti-HA in Fig. 3D, the sumoylated Sod1 was clearly detected at a position that coincided to the upper band in Fig. 3C, as well as Band 1 in Fig. 2. Clearly, Sod1 is sumoylated in yeast under these growth conditions. To further examine the sumoylation of Sod1, we purified the sumoylated Sod1 by three steps of affinity purification as described previously. Silver staining of the purified protein in Fig. 4A indicates that the sumoylated Sod1 was highly pure, along with some additional unmodified Sod1. The identity of the sumoylated Sod1 was again confirmed by anti-HA Western blot (see Fig. 4B). Furthermore, tryptic peptides from only Sod1 and Smt3 were found in the band corresponding to the sumoylated Sod1 by mass spectrometry. 3W. Zhou, J. J. Ryan, and H. Zhou, unpublished results. Additionally, two sumoylated peptides from Sod1 were identified by tandem mass spectrometry analysis (Table III). Trypsin digestion of a sumoylated protein will produce sumoylated peptide(s) containing an internal lysine residue, modified by a fragment derived from the C terminus of Smt3 with the sequence EQIGG via an isopeptide bond. The expected mass modification on the lysine residue due to sumoylation is 484.5 Da, which was used in tandem mass spectra analysis. Single mutation of these sumoylation sites revealed that Sod1 was modified at more than one site by Smt3 2; however, it is presently unknown how many lysine residues of Sod1p could be sumoylated. Further studies are needed to reveal the biological function of the sumoylation of Sod1 in yeast.Table IIISumoylated peptides identified by tandem mass spectrometry analysisProteinModified lysinePeptide sequence identified by LC-MS/MSCdc3Lys-63aThe site is a canonical consensus sequence ψKX(D/E) (ψ corresponds to a hydrophobic residue, X denotes any residue, and either an acidic D or E is the fourth amino acid) (15).(R)FEAAESDVKbThe modified lysine.VEPGLGMGITSSQSEKPol30Lys-127aThe site is a canonical consensus sequence ψKX(D/E) (ψ corresponds to a hydrophobic residue, X denotes any residue, and either an acidic D or E is the fourth amino acid) (15).(K)LMDIDADFLKbThe modified lysine.IEELQYDSTLSLPSSEFSKLys-164(R)DLSQLSDSINIMITKbThe modified lysine.ETIKSod1Lys-19aThe site is a canonical consensus sequence ψKX(D/E) (ψ corresponds to a hydrophobic residue, X denotes any residue, and either an acidic D or E is the fourth amino acid) (15).(K)GDAGVSGVVKbThe modified lysine.FEQASESEPTTVSYEIAGNSPNAERLys-70(K)KbThe modified lysine.THGAPTDEVRSpp41Lys-981aThe site is a canonical consensus sequence ψKX(D/E) (ψ corresponds to a hydrophobic residue, X denotes any residue, and either an acidic D or E is the fourth amino acid) (15).(K)GVTTPIKbThe modified lysine.IEDSDANVPPVSIAVSTIEPSQDKLys-1154aThe site is a canonical consensus sequence ψKX(D/E) (ψ corresponds to a hydrophobic residue, X denotes any residue, and either an acidic D or E is the fourth amino acid) (15).(K)RPQIKbThe modified lysine.PEVSVINLVQNLVNTKRhr2Lys-85(R)TYDAIAKbThe modified lysine.FAPDFADEEYVNKMrp8Lys-137(K)EFKbThe modified lysine.DIPDLKAos1Lys-35SAKbThe modified lysine.VLLINLGAIGSEITKa The site is a canonical consensus sequence ψKX(D/E) (ψ corresponds to a hydrophobic residue, X denotes any residue, and either an acidic D or E is the fourth amino acid) (15Johnson E.S.

Open table in a new tab Interestingly, enzymes that are known to catalyze sumoylation events in yeast, including the heterodimeric E1 enzyme consisting of Aos1 and Uba2 and the E2 enzyme Ubc9, were found to be sumoylated (see Table II). Ubc9 was found to be autosumoylated previously (25Bencsath K.P. Podgorski M.S. Pagala V.R. Slaughter C.A. Schulman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47938-47945Google Scholar). The sumoylation of E1 and E2 enzymes are not due to thioester formation between E1 and E2 enzymes with Smt3p, because they are unaffected by 100 mm DTT under boiling conditions. One previously known sumoylation substrate Cdc3 was also identified in this experiment. Additionally, translation initiation factor Tif2, translation elongation factors Tef2 and Eft2, and RNA polymerase I subunit Rpa49 were identified, along with several metabolic proteins. It thus appears that sumoylation is linked to protein translation in the ribosome and RNA polymerase function. Identification of Sumoylated Proteins in Yeast Cells under Stress Conditions—We next asked whether protein sumoylation is affected by various cellular stresses, including oxidative stress and changes in growth media. We found that the sumoylation pattern was affected significantly under these conditions, as shown in Fig. 5. Although there is a relatively low level of sumoylation in yeast cells without stress, in the presence of 1 mm H2O2 or 10% ethanol, many more proteins become sumoylated. Particularly when cells were treated with ethanol, the abundance of monomer Smt3p dropped significantly, whereas a much higher level of protein sumoylation was found. We chose to purify the sumoylated proteins from cells treated with hydrogen peroxide and ethanol, and the purified proteins were visualized by silver staining in Fig. 6. Because no discrete bands were present from the Western blot analysis in Fig. 5, the gel in Fig. 6 was sliced into 20 equal segments. The proteins from each gel slice were identified, and the results are shown in Table IV. Smt3p was found in all gel slices analyzed, indicating that there is a high level of sumoylation of the other proteins identified in the same gel slice. Based on their electrophoretic mobility, most of these proteins have observed molecular weights significantly higher than their theoretical molecular weights, suggesting that they are likely sumoylated. These sumoylated protein candidates appear to be involved in many diverse cellular pathways, as summarized in Table V.Fig. 6Silver staining of the purified sumoylated proteins from HZY1017 cells following hydrogen peroxide and ethanol treatments. Twenty equal segments were sliced from the gel and subjected to in-gel digestion and mass spectrometry analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2083733004,"Interferon (IFN)-λ1, -λ2, and -λ3 are the latest members of the class II cytokine family and were shown to have antiviral activity. Their receptor is composed of two chains, interleukin-28R/likely interleukin or cytokine or receptor 2 (IL-28R/LICR2) and IL-10Rβ, and mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, and STAT5. Here, we show that activation of this receptor by IFN-λ1 can also inhibit cell proliferation and induce STAT4 phosphorylation, further extending functional similarities with type I IFNs. We used IL-28R/LICR2-mutated receptors to identify the tyrosines required for STAT activation, as well as antiproliferative and antiviral activities. We found that IFN-λ1-induced STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated through tyrosines 343 and 517 of the receptor, which showed some similarities with tyrosines from type I IFN receptors involved in STAT2 activation. These two tyrosines were also responsible for antiviral and antiproliferative activities of IFN-λ1. By contrast, STAT4 phosphorylation (and to some extent STAT3 activation) was independent from IL-28R/LICR2 tyrosine residues. Taken together, these observations extend the functional similarities between IFN-λs and type I IFNs and shed some new light on the mechanisms of activation of STAT2 and STAT4 by these cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2165924903,"Wnt signaling pathways regulate many developmental responses; however, little is known about how Wnt ligands function on a biochemical level. Recent studies have shown that Wnt-3a is palmitoylated before secretion. Here we report that Drosophila Wnt-1 (Wingless) also undergoes a lipid modification. Lipidation occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is dependent on Porcupine, a putative O-acyltransferase. After modification, DWnt-1 partitions as a membrane-anchored protein and is sorted into lipid raft detergent-insoluble microdomains. Lipidation, raft targeting, and secretion can be blocked by the addition of 2-bromopalmitate, a competitive inhibitor of O-acyltransferase activity. Based on these results we propose a model whereby lipidation targets Wnt-1 to secretory vesicles that deliver the ligand to specialized microdomains at the cell surface where it can be packaged for secretion.

Wnt ligands play key roles in many developmental pathways (1Martinez Arias A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2Huelsken J. Behrens J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3977-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3Moon R.T. Bowerman B. Boutros M. Perrimon N. Science. 2002; 296: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). To understand how Wnts regulate so many developmental activities, it is necessary to define the biochemical steps that constitute the actual signal transduction events. With this goal in mind, we are studying the synthesis and secretion of active Wnt-1 ligand in Drosophila melanogaster. The WNT genes encode a large family of secreted proteins; these ligands share a signature WNT motif (C-K-C-H-G-(LIVMT)-S-G-X-C), 22 conserved cysteines, many highly charged amino acid residues, and several potential glycosylation sites. Based on their amino acid sequences, Wnt proteins should be soluble, secreted glycoproteins; yet, Wnts do not exhibit the properties expected of soluble hydrophilic proteins. For example, we have examined Drosophila Wnt-1 expression in transgenic S2 cells and found that only about 20% of the secreted protein is present in soluble conditioned medium; the majority of the extracellular Wnt-1 is associated with the cell surface and extracellular matrix (4Reichsman F. Smith L. Cumberledge S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Recent work by Nusse and co-workers (5Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates III, J.R. Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar) has shown that murine Wnt-3a is palmitoylated at a conserved cysteine residue (Cys-77). Their discovery suggests for the first time that lipid modifications may account for the unusual behavior of Wnt ligands. How palmitoylation affects Wnt-3a signaling and whether or not other Wnts are modified in a similar manner are questions now under investigation. Here, we provide evidence that Drosophila Wnt-1 is also lipid-modified. In addition, we investigate the functional significance of the lipid modification and the role of porcupine in Wnt-1 maturation and secretion. Many types of proteins (including cytosolic, transmembrane, and secreted proteins) are known to undergo S-palmitoylation, the reversible addition of palmitate to a cysteine via a thioester bond (6Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This posttranslational acylation is readily reversible and can regulate both protein localization and function. The addition of the palmitoyl moiety increases protein hydrophobicity and promotes membrane association (6Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation also affects intracellular trafficking in that palmitoylated proteins are frequently targeted to specific intracellular organelles as well as to detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs) 1The abbreviations used are: DRM, detergent-resistant microdomain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DFz2, DFrizzled2; Syx1A, syntaxin 1A; porc-, porcupine-; Hh, hedgehog; Drac-1, Drosophila Rac-1. 1The abbreviations used are: DRM, detergent-resistant microdomain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DFz2, DFrizzled2; Syx1A, syntaxin 1A; porc-, porcupine-; Hh, hedgehog; Drac-1, Drosophila Rac-1. located at the plasma membrane (7Patterson S.I.

These DRMs, commonly referred to as lipid rafts, are rich in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids and so exist in a separate liquid-ordered phase within the plasma membrane (9Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar). Raft DRMs often form signal transduction centers. The cellular machinery needed for signal transduction becomes organized as some proteins are targeted to rafts, whereas others are excluded. For example, cell surface receptors are sometimes localized to same membrane microdomains where their downstream intracellular partners are also concentrated (10Qanbar R. Bouvier M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Secreted proteins can also be palmitoylated. The mature form of Hedgehog, Hh-Np, contains two unusual lipid modifications (a C-terminal linked cholesterol moiety and an N-terminal palmitoyl adduct). These lipid modifications increase Hh-Np hydrophobicity, influence apical sorting of the ligand, and likely play a role in the partitioning of Hh-Np into raft DRMs (11Pepinsky R.B. Zeng C. Wen D. Rayhorn P. Baker D.P. Williams K.P. Bixler S.A. Ambrose C.M. Garber E.A. Miatkowski K. Taylor F.R. Wang E.A. Galdes A. J. Biol.

Skinny Hedgehog, a putative O-acyltransferase, is required for the palmitoylation of Drosophila Hh-Np (15Jeong J. McMahon A.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Clonal analysis studies (12Chamoun Z. Mann R.K. Nellen D. von Kessler D.P. Bellotto M. Beachy P.A. Basler K. Science. 2001; 293: 2080-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) suggest that palmitoylation is essential for Hh signaling in the wing disc. In the absence of Skinny Hedgehog activity, Hh-Np is not palmitoylated, and Hedgehog signaling activity is greatly reduced. Skinny Hedgehog belongs to a diverse family of membrane-bound O-acyltransferases (16Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 111-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Many of these enzymes catalyze the transfer of fatty acids to hydroxyl groups on hydrophobic targets. The target substrates vary widely and include lipids (cholesterol acyltransferase), alginate (AlgI), and waxes (wax synthase). Skinny Hedgehog is somewhat unusual in that it is required for the synthesis of a thioester-linked fatty acid. The chemistry of S-palmitoylation and the palmitoyl acyltransferase enzymes have not been well studied. Some palmitoyl acyltransferases reside in the cytosol; others, like Skinny Hedgehog, are thought to function within the ER (6Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Jeong J. McMahon A.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Curiously, the vertebrate Sonic Hedgehog protein, Shh-Np, contains an amide-linked palmitoyl group at the N-terminal Cys. Pepinsky et al. (11Pepinsky R.B. Zeng C. Wen D. Rayhorn P. Baker D.P. Williams K.P. Bixler S.A. Ambrose C.M. Garber E.A. Miatkowski K. Taylor F.R. Wang E.A. Galdes A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14037-14045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) have suggested that Shh-Np acylation occurs via a two-step mechanism, which is the initial synthesis of a thioester intermediate linking the palmitoyl group to the side chain of the terminal cysteine followed by an intramolecular rearrangement that transfers the palmitoyl group to the N-terminal nitrogen (11Pepinsky R.B.

The presence of the amide bond may be functionally significant because an amide bond is far more stable than a thioester linkage. It is intriguing that porcupine also encodes a putative multipass transmembrane protein belonging to the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase superfamily (16Hofmann K. Trends Biochem.

Genetic and immunocytochemical studies suggest that porcupine is required for the secretion of active Wnt-1 ligand. porcupine functions upstream and is required by Wnt-1 expressing cells. Wnt-1 is synthesized in porcupine- mutants; however, it accumulates within the expressing cells. All extracellular Wnt-1 staining is absent, suggesting that Wnt-1 secretion is blocked in the porcupine- mutant animals (16Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 111-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 21van den Heuvel M. Harryman-Samos C. Klingensmith J. Perrimon N. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5293-5302Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The Wnt-1 secretion defect can be bypassed by driving overexpression of Wnt-1. In this case, ectopic Wnt-1 secretion leads to ectopic signaling and death. Thus porcupine has an essential role in directing proper Wnt-1 secretion. Studies with transgenic S2 cells (18Tanaka K. Okabayashi K. Asashima M. Perrimon N. Kadowaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4300-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Tanaka K. Kitagawa Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have shown that Porcupine and the N-terminal portion of Wnt-1 can be co-immunoprecipitated in the same complex, suggesting that Porcupine may interact directly with Wnt-1. Several questions should now be addressed. Does Porcupine mediate a posttranslational modification of Wnt-1? If so, what is the modification, and why is this modification necessary for normal Wnt-1 secretion? Here, we report a series of experiments testing the hypothesis that porcupine is required for lipidation of Wnt-1. We present evidence that Wnt-1 is lipid-modified and that this modification converts Wnt-1 into a membrane-anchored protein that is partitioned into specialized lipid raft microdomains before secretion. Moreover, we show that Porcupine activity is required for both lipidation and the subsequent targeting of DWnt-1 to specialized raft DRMs at the cell surface. Cell Culture, Protein Induction, and Western Blotting—Drosophila S2 cell lines were cultured as described (4Reichsman F. Smith L. Cumberledge S. J.

Butyl-Sepharose Chromatography—Cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in 2 × 106 cells/ml cold binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.025% CHAPS), with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, E-64, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) (Sigma). Whole cell lysates were prepared by passing the cell suspension through a 27½-gauge needle 20 times and then centrifuging at 5000 × g for 5 min to remove debris. Whole cell lysates were incubated with butyl-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) (3:7 v/v ratio of beads to lysate) for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound and bound proteins were separated by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min. Proteins were eluted from the resin in a series of ½ column volume washes.

S2-DWnt-1 and S2-DFz2 cells were pelleted, resuspended in cold PBS and 0.05% CHAPS (2 × 105 cells/ml) containing 1× protease inhibitors mixture, and then lysed by passing the cell suspension 20 times through a 27½-gauge needle. Lysates were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min to remove debris, and then total membranes were isolated by centrifuging the lysate at 80,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Membrane fractions were resuspended in 100 mm sodium carbonate at pH 11.0 for 30 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 80,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Equal fractions of supernatant and pellet were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Triton X-114 Phase Separation—5 × 106 cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold Triton lysis buffer (200 μl of Tris-buffered saline-condensed Triton X-114 and 800 μl of Tris-buffered saline) and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C, which was followed by gentle shaking at 4 °C for 1 h. Supernatant was incubated at 37 °C for 8 min and then centrifuged at 1000 × g at room temperature for 10 min. The aqueous phase and the detergent phase were separated, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. Preparation of Whole Animal Extracts—hs-wg;porc- larva were generated by crossing porcPB16;FM7c females to hs-wg:TM6Tb males. Late third instar porcPB16;hs-wg animals were identified by scoring for non-Tubby, y-male larvae. Two genotypes were used for hs-wg control animals; they are hs-wg;FM7c (obtained from the cross described above) and hs-wg;TM6Tb. Individual larvae were heat-shocked for 1 h at 37 °C and then allowed to recover at 25 °C for 2 h. After heat shock and recovery, each animal was lysed individually. For butyl-Sepharose chromatography, each animal was lysed in 100 μl of binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, with 1× protease inhibitor mixture) by first homogenizing the animal with a pestle and then passing the extract 20 times through a 27½-gauge syringe, which was followed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min to remove debris. Crude extracts were subjected to butyl-Sepharose chromatography. For sodium carbonate extraction, crude protein extracts were obtained by homogenizing each larvae in cold PBS and 0.05% CHAPS (2 × 105 cells/ml) containing 1× protease inhibitors mixture as described above. After centrifuging at 5000 × g for 5 min to remove debris, the membrane fraction was isolated and subjected to sodium carbonate extraction as described above. For Triton X-114 phase separation, each larva was lysed in 100 μl of ice-cold Triton lysis buffer by homogenization with a pestle, and then the lysate was passed through a 27½-gauge needle 20 times. Protein extracts were subjected to Triton X-114 phase separation as described above. Hydroxylamine Treatment of S2-DWnt-1 Whole Cell Extract—5 × 106 cells were collected and lysed in 500 μl of PBS with 1× protease inhibitors mixture. The lysates were mixed with 500 μl of 2 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, or 500 μl of 2 m hydroxylamine/HCl, pH 7.5, and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The samples were then subjected to butyl-Sepharose hydrophobic chromatography and Western blot analyses as described above. Isolation of Lipid Raft Detergent-resistant Microdomains—Raft DRMs were prepared and isolated as described (24Rietveld A. Neutz S. Simon K. Eaton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12049-12054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 25Waheed A. Jones T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32409-32412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in PBS and then resuspended in cold TNET buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100) with 1× protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were lysed by passing the suspension through a 27½-gauge needle 20 times; lysates were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min to remove debris, and the supernatant was diluted to 1:2 (v/v) with OptiPrep™, a 60% (w/v) solution of iodixanol in water (Accurate Chemicals and Scientific Corp.) to reach a final concentration of 40% OptiPrep. Step gradients were formed in Beckman SW60 tubes by adding 1 ml of the 40% OptiPrep-cell suspension overlaid with 3.0 ml of 30% OptiPrep and 1.0 ml of 5% OptiPrep in TNET. Gradients were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 h. 0.5-ml fractions were collected (from the top). Equal amounts of each fraction were subjected 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. To isolate lipid rafts from larvae, each animal was lysed in 100 μl of TNET buffer and then was passed 20 times through a 27½-gauge needle. Debris were removed by centrifuging the lysates at 5000 g for 5 min. The crude extract was mixed with 200 μl of 60% OptiPrep in TLS55 tubes (Beckman) and then overlaid with 900 μl of 30% OptiPrep, 300 μl of 5% OptiPrep. Gradients were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 h. 150-μl fractions were collected (from the top) and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Cholesterol/Sterol Depletion of S2 Cells Using Methyl-β-cyclodextrin and Lovastatin—We examined the effects of lovastatin (gift from Merck and Co.) and methyl-β-cyclodextrin at a variety of concentrations, checking both cell viability and cholesterol/ergosterol levels to identify the optimal conditions and drug concentrations. Confluent S2-DWnt-1 cells were incubated in lipid-free medium (Schneider's Drosophila medium with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and 2.5% penicillin/streptomycin) containing 0.5% methyl β-cyclodextrin (Sigma) with ethanol or with 100, 200, and 500 μm lovastatin (Calbiochem) for 2-3 h at 25 °C and then heat-shocked at 37 °C for 1 h followed by a 2-h recovery at 25 °C. Cells were monitored hourly for viability. Loss on cell viability was <5% for cells treated with 100 and 200 μm lovastatin and 20-30% for cells cultured in 500 μm lovastatin. After treatment, the cells were collected and washed. Whole cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by fractionation over butyl-Sepharose as described above. Total lipids were extracted as described in Ref. 26Jones H.E. Harwood J.L. Bowen I.D. Griffiths G. Lipids. 1992; 27: 984-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar. Neutral lipids were analyzed by multi-one-dimensional thin layer chromatography as described previously (27White T. Bursten S. Federighti D. Lewis R.A. Nudelman E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) using three sequential solvent systems: chloroform:methanol: acetic acid (90:10:0, v/v/v) and then hexane:diethyl ether:cetone (60: 40:5, v/v/v) followed by hexane:iethyl ether (97:3, v/v). The thin layer chromatography plates were sprayed with Premulin dye (Sigma), and the fractionated lipids were visualized using a PhosphorImager Storm 840 imaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Each lipid spot was compared with known standards and quantified using ImageQuant 2.0 software (Amersham Biosciences). After growth in 0.5% methyl-β-cyclodextrin and 100 m lovastatin, S2 cells showed a 62% decrease in total cholesterol/ergosterol levels. 2-Bromopalmitate Treatment of S2 Cells—S2-DWnt-1 cells were grown to confluency and transferred into low fetal bovine serum medium (Schneider's Drosophila medium with 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin). Cells were incubated for 1-2 h at 25 °C with 2-bromopalmitate ranging from 0, 200, 400, and 800 μm in Me2SO. DWnt-1 expression was induced by heat shocking cells at 37 °C for 1 h and allowing them to recover at 25 °C for 2 h. Preparation of conditioned medium was as described in Reichsman et al. (4Reichsman F. Smith L. Cumberledge S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). A Posttranslational Modification in the ER Converts DWnt-1 Into a Membrane-anchored Protein—We started these studies by asking whether DWnt-1 displays hydrophobic properties similar to those described for murine Wnt-3a (5Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates III, J.R. Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). The first set of experiments examined the hydrophobicity of Wnt-1 using standard hydrophobic chromatography techniques (Fig. 1a). Whole cell lysates were prepared from transgenic S2 cell lines expressing Wnt-1 under control of the inducible Hsp70 promoter (S2-DWnt-1). Extracts were solubilized in the presence of 0.025% CHAPS and then incubated with butyl-Sepharose. After incubation, the hydrophobic resin was washed, unbound proteins were collected, and bound proteins were eluted in a series of salt and detergent washes. All fractions were then analyzed by Western blotting. Hydrophilic proteins typically do not bind butyl-Sepharose; peripheral membrane proteins bind weakly and are usually eluted by agents that disrupt electrostatic and H-bond interactions. Integral membrane proteins bind tightly and are eluted only by detergents and organic solvents. The three panels in Fig. 1a show the elution profiles for DWnt-1, PCNA (a soluble hydrophilic nuclear protein), and DFz2 (a seven-pass transmembrane protein). As expected, PCNA did not bind butyl-Sepharose and was recovered in the flow-through (Fig. 1a, middle panel). DWnt-1 bound to the butyl-Sepharose beads, remained bound in subsequent low ionic strength washes, and was finally eluted by 1% SDS, a strongly ionic detergent (Fig. 1a, top panel). This type of chromatographic behavior is indicative of proteins that contain a strongly hydrophobic surface. In fact, the elution profile of DWnt-1 was identical to that of DFz2 (compare the top and bottom panels of Fig. 1a). These observations led us to hypothesize that DWnt-1 is partitioning as a membrane-anchored protein. We tested this hypothesis by asking whether DWnt-1 meets the standard experimental criteria for integral membrane proteins as defined by their behavior during sodium carbonate extraction and Triton X-114 phase separation (Fig. 1, b and c). S2 whole cell lysates were extracted with sodium carbonate, integral membrane proteins were separated from luminal and peripheral membrane proteins by centrifugation, and the fractions were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1b). As expected, PCNA was found in the supernatant, whereas DWnt-1 and DFz2 remained with the membrane fraction. To be certain that DWnt-1 was partitioning into membranes and not simply precipitating at a high pH level, we also carried out Triton X-114 phase separation studies (Fig. 1c). Cells were lysed in the presence of Triton X-114, the insoluble material was discarded, and the aqueous and detergent phases were separated by centrifugation. Both phases were then examined by Western blotting. Fig. 1c shows that PCNA remained in the aqueous phase after Triton X-114 extraction, whereas DWnt-1 and DFz2 partitioned into the detergent phase. Thus in all three experiments, DWnt-1 displayed the characteristic properties of a membrane-anchored protein. This hydrophobicity is remarkably similar to that described previously for murine Wnt-3a (5Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates III, J.R. Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be a feature common to many if not all Wnt ligands. Two observations suggested that DWnt-1 is lipidated in the ER and that this posttranslational modification creates a membrane anchor. First, we found that DWnt-1 lost its hydrophobic properties after treatment with hydroxylamine-HCl (Fig. 2a). Hydroxylamine-HCl cleaves thioester and ester bonds, releasing fatty acyl groups from cysteine, serine, and threonine residues. Fig. 2a shows the butyl-Sepharose chromatographic profiles for DWnt-1 before and after hydroxylamine treatment. After treatment, the ligand no longer bound butyl-Sepharose, eluting instead in the flow-through fraction. Second, while carrying out a series of in vitro translation reactions with and without microsomes, we found that untranslocated DWnt-1 remained water-soluble, whereas DWnt-1 synthesized inside the ER partitioned as a membrane-anchored protein after sodium carbonate extraction (data not shown). Together, these results support the hypothesis that Wnt-1 hydrophobicity is a result of lipid modification, and the lipidation process occurs in the ER. Given previous work demonstrating that murine Wnt-3a is palmitoylated at amino acid 77, a conserved cysteine, we tested this idea directly. 2-Bromopalmitate Inhibits DWnt-1 Lipidation—If DWnt-1 is modified by the addition of an ester- or thioester-linked lipid, it should be possible to block DWnt-1 lipidation by inhibiting acyltransferase activity. We tested this idea by expressing DWnt-1 in the presence and absence of 2-bromopalmitate and then assaying for DWnt-1 hydrophobicity. 2-Bromopalmitate blocks the transfer of palmitate from palmitoyl-CoA to cysteinyl thiols and is a general inhibitor of O-acyltransferase activities (28Webb Y. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig. 2b. DWnt-1 protein synthesized in the presence of 400 or 800 μm of 2-bromopalmitate showed a dramatic decrease in butyl-Sepharose binding and an apparent loss of hydrophobicity (Fig. 2b). These results argue that DWnt-1 is lipidated and that its hydrophobicity is most likely attributed to acyltransferase activity. We speculate that the lipid group is likely to be a palmitoyl adduct as has been reported for murine Wnt-3a (5Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates III, J.R. Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). However, 2-bromopalmitate can also inhibit other enzymes associated with lipid metabolism (29Coleman R.A. Rao P. Fogelsong R.J. Bardes E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1125: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have not been able to directly label DWnt-1 using a radiolabeled palmitate or palmitoyl-CoA precursor. 2L. Zhai, D. Chaturvedi, and S. Cumberledge, unpublished results. Thus definitive confirmation of the lipid moiety may require direct physical measurements such as mass spectrometry analysis of fragmentation patterns. Lipidation Targets DWnt-1 to Lipid Raft Microdomains—What is the functional significance of DWnt-1 lipidation? Because many palmitoylated proteins are associated with raft DRMs (6Linder M.E. Des"

https://openalex.org/W2037825839,"Oxidative modifications of cellular components have been described as one of the main contributions to aged phenotype. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two distinct life spans can be considered, replicative and chronological. The relationship between both aging models is still not clear despite suggestions that these phenomena may be related. In this work, we show that replicative and chronological-aged yeast cells are affected by an oxidative stress situation demonstrated by increased protein carbonylation when compared with young cells. The data on the identification of these oxidatively modified proteins gives clues to better understand cellular dysfunction that occurs during aging. Strikingly, although in both aging models metabolic differences are important, major targets are almost the same. Common targets include stress resistance proteins (Hsp60 and Hsp70) and enzymes involved in glucose metabolism such as enolase, glyceraldehydes-3-P dehydrogenase, fructose-1,6-biphosphate aldolase, pyruvate decarboxylase, and alcohol dehydrogenase. In both aging models, calorie restriction results in decreased damage to these proteins. In addition, chronological-aged cells grown under glucose restriction displayed lowered levels of lipid peroxidation product lipofuscin. Intracellular iron concentration is kept almost unchanged, whereas in non-restricted cells, the values increase up 4–5 times. The pro-oxidant effects of such increased iron concentration would account for the damage observed. Also, calorie-restricted cells show undamaged catalase, which clearly appears carbonylated in cells grown at a high glucose concentration. These results may explain lengthening of the viability of chronological-aged cells and could have an important role in replicative life span extension by calorie restriction.

Such damage will lead to altered structure and loss of biological function (1Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Google Scholar, 2Sinclair D. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 857-867Google Scholar). Superoxide anions cause the release of iron-sulfur clusters of several enzymes leading to its inactivation (3Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1478-1483Google Scholar). The hydroxyl radical generated by H2O2 and transition metals, such as iron or copper, or by radiolysis is involved in protein backbone fragmentation or modification of amino acid side chains (1Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Google Scholar). There are increasing evidence that accumulation of these dysfunctional molecules in the cell over a lifetime contributes to the aging phenotype (4Harman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7124-7128Google Scholar, 5Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Google Scholar). In this context, the pioneering studies of Stadtman and co-workers (6Oliver C.N. Ahn B. Moerman E.J. Goldstein S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5488-5491Google Scholar, 7Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Google Scholar) describe that oxidatively modified proteins (measured as protein carbonylation) accumulate as a function of cell age in human erythrocytes and fibroblasts. Moreover, protein damage in premature aging diseases such as progeria and Werner's syndrome was much higher than in age-matched normal individuals (7Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Google Scholar). Oxidative modification of proteins has also been associated to aging-related pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (8Smith C.D. Carney J.M. Starke R.P. Oliver C.N. Stadtman E.R. Floyd R.A. Markesbery W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10540-10543Google Scholar). Using a proteomic approach, the identification of specific damaged proteins provided new insights into mechanisms of this neurodegenerative disease (9Butterfield D.A. Free Radic. Res. 2002; 36: 1307-1313Google Scholar, 10Butterfield D.A. Brain Res. 2004; 1000: 1-7Google Scholar, 11Choi J. Forster M.J. McDonald S.R. Weintraub S.T. Caroll C.A. Gracy R.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1155-1162Google Scholar). In yeast cells, two types of aging have been described, chronological and replicative. Chronological aging refers to the ability of stationary cultures to maintain viability over time. Investigations on this field have been used as a valuable model to study oxidative damage and aging of post-mitotic tissues of higher organisms (2Sinclair D. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 857-867Google Scholar, 13MacLean M. Harris N. Piper P.W. Yeast. 2001; 18: 499-509Google Scholar, 14Herman P.K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 602-607Google Scholar). The damaged cell components cannot be diluted in these non-dividing cells. Consistently, the systems that get rid of these damaged components or prevent such damage will contribute to an increased chronological life span. Stationary phase cells become more resistant to heat and oxidative stresses, and overexpression of Sod1 and Sod2 extends life span by 30%. The metabolism of these cells tends to accumulate glycogen and trehalose, and the cell wall thickens (15Werner-Washburne M. Braun E.L. Crawford M.E. Peck V.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1159-1166Google Scholar). Respiration is the main source of energy obtained from previously stored nutrients. Cell division in budding yeast cells occurs a finite number of times. As cells grow old, they accumulate bud scars, increase their size, and become unfertile and the nucleolus fragments. At the metabolic level, glucose metabolism shifts from glycolysis toward gluconeogenesis, which depends on the function of snf1, a kinase involved in cellular-adaptive responses to glucose deprivation (reviewed in Ref. 16Bitterman K.J. Medvedik O. Sinclair D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 376-399Google Scholar). The regulation of this replicative aging points toward the Sir2 protein, a class III histone deacetylase that consumes NAD+ and suppresses rDNA recombination (17Bitterman K.J. Anderson R.M. Cohen H.Y. Latorre-Esteves M. Sinclair D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45099-45107Google Scholar). Such recombination leads to the formation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles, which accumulate in old cells and are involved in cell death (18Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Google Scholar). Calorie restriction is one of the models that has been proven to extend life span from yeast to mammals (19Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Google Scholar, 20Roth G.S. Ingram D.K. Lane M.A. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1999; 47: 896-903Google Scholar). Lengthening of yeast life span was described by limiting the available glucose (0.5%) in a sir2-dependent manner or by reducing the activity of glucose-sensing cyclic AMP-dependent kinase (21Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Google Scholar, 22Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Google Scholar). Cultures with limited glucose showed increased respiration compared with 2% glucose. Interestingly, overexpression of transcription factor Hap4, which triggers the expression of genes involved in aerobic respiration, also extended life span even in 2% glucose (22Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Google Scholar). Because under aerobic respiration the NAD+/NADH ratio differs with respect to fermenting conditions, changes in this ratio would regulate Sir2 activity under calorie restriction (22Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Google Scholar, 23Lin S.J. Ford E. Haigis M. Liszt G. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 12-16Google Scholar). Aging studies in budding yeast have reported recently that (i) carbonylated proteins accumulate with replicative age and (ii) oxidized proteins are not inherited by daughter cells (24Aguilaniu H. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Nyström T. Science. 2003; 299: 1751-1753Google Scholar). In this work, we have identified oxidatively damaged proteins produced as the yeast cell age as well as other markers such as lipofuscin accumulation, iron concentration, and lipid peroxidation. The effect of calorie restriction on these parameters has also been analyzed. A survey of enzyme activities of the main protein targets indicated that oxidative modification of catalase can play an important role on the cell viability in chronological aging. Organisms and Culture Conditions—The strain used throughout this work was Saccharomyces cerevisiae CML128 (25Gallego C. Garí E. Colomina N. Herrero E. Aldea M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7196-7206Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in rich YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or under calorie restriction (YPD medium with 0.5% glucose) by incubation in a rotary shaker at 30 °C. Cell viability was compared by spreading serial dilutions of the cultures in YPD plates with solid medium and incubation at 30 °C for 3 days. When indicated, cell growth were performed in synthetic medium either with 2 or 0.5% glucose and supplemented with amino acids, adenine and uracil, as described previously (26Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Michell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 207-210Google Scholar). Isolation of Replicative Old Mother Cells—Old cells (16–18-generation-old) were purified by a modification of the biotin-streptavidin magnetic sorting procedure (27Park P.U. McVey M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 468-477Google Scholar). 60 ml of exponentially growing cells to an A600 of 0.5–0.6 (∼6–12 × 108 cell) were labeled with 50 mg of biotin for 30 min. After several washes with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound biotin, streptavidin-coated paramagnetic iron beads (Qiagen) were added. Cells were incubated for 60 min and resuspended in 250 ml of the corresponding YPD medium (normal or calorie-restricted). Cell growth was allowed for ∼400–450 min (four generations). At this time, cells were centrifuged, resuspended in the respective medium, and sorted in a magnet. Unbound cells were removed, and the sorting procedure was repeated once. After purification, cells were resuspended in fresh medium (250 ml) and allowed to grow for four generations. The entire procedure was repeated twice, resulting in 16–18-generation-old cells. In the last sorting separation, the purification step was repeated three times. At the end, cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at -20 °C. In our hands and compared with published procedures, (i) more cells could be isolated in each experiment, (ii) final recovery was better, and (iii) the amount of medium needed was reduced. To determine age and purity, bud scars were counted after labeling with fluorescent brightener (Calcofluor) followed by fluorescent microscopy visualization as described previously (27Park P.U. McVey M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 468-477Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cells isolated by the sorting procedure were resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, plus 10 mm dithiothreitol and treated with zymoliase at 30 °C for 90 min to digest the cell wall. A concentrated solution of SDS previously heated at 95 °C was added (final SDS concentration: 6%) and incubated for 5 min at 95 °C. Cell extracts were obtained after centrifugation to remove cell debris and magnetic beads. Protein concentration was determined by the Micro Dc Bio-Rad kit. Protein carbonyl groups were derivatized with dinitrophenylhydrazine as published previously (28Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Google Scholar). In the case of chronological aging, cell extracts were prepared as described previously (29Cabiscol E. Bellí G. Tamarit J. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44531-44538Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method, and protein was derivatized with dinitrophenylhydrazine as before. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis— Protein from cell extracts was precipitated with acetone (at room temperature to minimize SDS precipitation), rinsed three-times in acetone, and resuspended in rehydration buffer (9 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% immobilized pH gradient buffer (Amersham Biosciences), and traces of bromphenol blue) at a final concentration of 2–4 mg/ml. Isoelectric focusing (10–30 μg of protein) was performed in immobilized pH gradient strips. Second dimension SDS-PAGE was performed on 11% acrylamide gels followed by anti-dinitrophenyl Western blot (30Cabiscol E. Piulats E. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27393-27398Google Scholar). Parallel gels were silver-stained to visualize total protein and were used for protein identification. Proteins were identified by fingerprint mass spectrometry. Analyses—Total cellular iron was determined under reducing conditions with bathophenanthroline sulfonate as chelator (29Cabiscol E. Bellí G. Tamarit J. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44531-44538Google Scholar). Detection of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) was carried out by means of a fluorimetric assay (31Brown R.K. Kelly F.J. Punchard N.A. Kelly F.J. Free Radicals: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1996: 119-131Google Scholar). Lipofuscin was detected by its broad spectrum of autofluorescence, but to simplify the figure, only one barrier filter image is shown (λex 450–490; λem 520 nm). Quantification of protein carbonyl content of crude extracts was performed by high pressure liquid chromatography after dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatization (28Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Google Scholar). Values are given in nmol/mg protein. Resistance to H2O2 was tested on cells grown either on 2% glucose or 0.5% glucose. At the middle of exponential phase (A600 0.5), 5 mm H2O2 was added to the culture. After a 1-h treatment, viability was measured by plating serial dilutions (1:5) on YPD plates. Enzyme Activities—The following cell extracts were broken using glass beads and assayed as described in the respective references: alcohol dehydrogenase and enolase (32Maitra P.K. Lobo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 475-488Google Scholar), pyruvate decarboxylase (33Lynen F. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 17-33Google Scholar), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (34Flikweert M.T. Van der Zanden L. Janssen W. M. Th.M. Steensma H.Y. Van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Yeast. 1996; 12: 247-257Google Scholar), catalase, and super-oxide dismutase (SOD) (35Jakubowski W. Bilinski T. Bartosz G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 659-664Google Scholar). To determine Mn-SOD activity, 1 mm NaCN, which inhibits 95% of the CuZn-SOD activity, was added to the reaction mixture (36Geller B.L. Winge D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 105-114Google Scholar). CuZn-SOD activity was obtained by subtracting Mn-SOD activity from the total activity. Calorie Restriction Prevents Protein Oxidative Damage Resulting from Replicative Aging—One of the most studied markers resulting from oxidative stress is protein carbonyl formation (30Cabiscol E. Piulats E. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27393-27398Google Scholar, 37Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3027-3032Google Scholar, 38Costa V.M.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 253-259Google Scholar). Although protein damage produced under replicative aging in yeast was already described (24Aguilaniu H. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Nyström T. Science. 2003; 299: 1751-1753Google Scholar), identification of major oxidized proteins has not yet been performed. Crude extracts from purified populations of young (1–2-generation-old) and old (16–18-generation-old) cells were derivatized with dinitrophenylhydrazine. Proteins were submitted to two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by Western blot anti-dinitrophenyl. The results shown in Fig. 1 indicated that there was an increased level of protein damage in old cells compared with young ones. Oxidized proteins were identified by mass spectrometry (Table I). Main targets involved glycolytic enzymes and stress resistance proteins like Ssa1 and Ssa2 (Hsp70 proteins) and the mitochondrial Hsp60. Damage to these proteins was clearly reduced in old cells isolated from cultures grown under calorie restriction (Fig. 1). This result is consistent with the role of calorie restriction extending replicative life span in yeast.Table IIdentification of major oxidized proteins in both replicative and chronologically aged cellsReplicativeChronologicalSpot numberaSpot number refers to two-dimensional gels obtained from replicatively aged cells (Fig. 1)ProteinbProteins were identified by fingerprint mass spectrometry.

Medvedik O. Sinclair D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 376-399Google Scholar). However, as for replicative aging, identification of oxidized proteins under chronological aging has not been performed. Western blot anti-dinitrophenyl of two-dimensional gels from cells grown for several weeks in YPD showed an increase in protein carbonylation (Fig. 2, A and B). Peptide fingerprinting mass spectrometry allowed identification of main oxidized proteins (Table I). It is worth noting that replicative and chronological-aged cells shared most of the oxidized proteins. Hsp70 and the mitochondrial Hsp60 were common targets, but Hsp90s (both the inducible Hsp82 and the constitutive Hsc82) and catalase T were only present as damaged proteins under chronological aging. Also, the enzymes from the glycolytic and the energy metabolism pathways became highly oxidized in both models. Enolase 1 is highly induced after the diauxic shift and present in equally amounts along the stationary phase compared with enolase 2. This isoenzyme was more prone to oxidation than enolase 1, which could only be detected after day 23 (Fig. 2A). It is also interesting to observe that several major spots were clearly resistant to oxidation (Fig. 2C). Those spots are indicated in the legend of Fig. 2. Calorie restriction also prevented oxidative damage on budding aging (Fig. 2D). A time course of protein oxidation was quantitated by high pressure liquid chromatography (Fig. 2E). A clear increase was observed in cells grown at high glucose concentration; meanwhile, cells grown with 0.5% glucose showed lower and stable levels of protein carbonyls. Calorie Restriction Prevents Several Phenotypic Characteristics of Aging and Increases Chronological Life Span—In addition to protein oxidation, we analyzed several phenotypic traits (iron, lipofuscin, and TBARS) on chronological-aged yeast grown either on 2 or 0.5% glucose. Iron is one of the main agents involved in oxidative damage, which through the Fenton reaction produces the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. As shown in Fig. 3A, there was a 4–5-times increase of iron accumulation in cells grown on 2% glucose. In these cells, lipofuscin accumulation, which has been known for many years as a hallmark of aging in higher organisms (40Brunk U.T. Terman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 196-2002Google Scholar), also was clearly visible (Fig. 3B). Its broad fluorescent spectrum has been described as indicative of this insoluble mixture of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, which present additionally high concentrations of metals, especially iron (40Brunk U.T. Terman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 196-2002Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation measured as TBARS showed a straight increase over time in cells grown on 2% glucose, reaching (after 40 days) values 8–10 times higher than those observed in exponentially growing cells (Fig. 3C). These aging markers were greatly reduced under calorie restriction (Fig. 3, A–C). The results described above are in agreement with the differences in cell viability observed over the stationary phase (Fig. 3D). Under our conditions, <5% of the cells remained viable when grown in YPD with 2% glucose after 60 days in culture. After the same period, >90% of the cells were viable when cultured in YPD with 0.5% glucose. Calorie restriction also increased survival when synthetic medium was used instead of YPD (Fig. 3E). The increase in viability could be explained by an improved resistance to oxidative stress. Increased respiration on low glucose would trigger the synthesis of antioxidant systems. In agreement with this assumption, the results shown in Fig. 3F indicated that calorie-restricted cells presented higher resistance to H2O2. Enzyme Activities Are Differentially Affected by Aging and Calorie Restriction—The relevance of protein oxidation in enzyme activity could give a clue of its role in cell viability. The activity of the main oxidatively damaged enzymes was compared among cells cultured on 2 or 0.5% glucose from exponential to late stationary phase (60 days). As is shown in Fig. 4, the evolution of catalase activity was clearly different among cells grown on 2 and 0.5% glucose. While the activity remained high in 0.5% glucose, a progressive decrease starting around day 20 was observed in the 2% glucose. Interestingly, this inactivation was concomitant with its carbonylation (Fig. 4). The difference observed in catalase activity prompted us to study SOD, another antioxidant enzyme, especially relevant in stationary phase (41Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Google Scholar). There was a well known increase in both cytosolic and mitochondrial SOD activities during the diauxic shift. In stationary phase, a greater decrease was observed in cells grown in 2% glucose compared with 0.5% glucose. These differences were maintained until day 60 (36 versus 92 units/mg in CuZn-SOD and 36 versus 68 units/mg in Mn-SOD) (Fig. 4). Activities of the glycolytic enzymes showed a decrease starting around day 30, reaching a minimum level at day 60, in accordance with maximum protein oxidation. During this period, no differences in protein levels, measured by Western blot, were found (data not shown). The lack of correlation between increase in protein carbonylation and maintenance of enzyme activities at the beginning of stationary phase may be explained by synthesis of isoenzymes with different physiological functions to those present in exponential phase. However, no relevant differences between restricted versus non-restricted cells were observed at the end of the stationary phase (Fig. 4). The results described in this paper showed that oxidative damage found in both replicative and chronological-aged yeast presented clear differences between cells grown on 2% and cells grown on 0.5% glucose. In chronological aging, the metabolic change occurring along the diauxic shift triggered a huge induction of stress defenses. As a result, cells in stationary phase are highly resistant to several stresses including oxidative stress (42Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Google Scholar, 43Stephen D.W. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is a ROS increase observed in old cells grown at high glucose concentration. ROS formation may be a consequence of the iron accumulation throughout the stationary phase. Iron is a transition metal essential in redox reactions, but this property makes it potentially toxic. Lipofuscin, which contains high amounts of this metal, also accumulates in this phase. This often called age pigment is an intralysosomal, insoluble polymeric substance primarily composed of cross-linked protein residues and lipids and is formed because of iron-catalyzed oxidative processes (40Brunk U.T. Terman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 196-2002Google Scholar). Because iron accumulated in lipofuscin is not available for the cells, this situation could be sensed as an intracellular metal depletion and iron transport system would be induced to promote entrance of iron. Consequently, ROS generation will increase and damage to all cellular macromolecules will occur. Protein carbonyl detection as a measure of oxidative damage revealed that two important groups of proteins became modified in this situation: 1) enzymes of the glycolytic pathway and 2) molecular chaperones. Interestingly, these targets were already identified as oxidatively modified proteins by treatment of yeast cells with H2O2 (30Cabiscol E. Piulats E. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27393-27398Google Scholar). Under such stress, major targets such as enolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were highly inactivated because of oxidative modification. Beside the susceptibility of glycolytic enzymes to oxidation during aging, an interesting observation is the different oxidative modification of enolase isoenzymes. Although enolase 2 involved in glycolytic flux appears to be one of the first oxidized proteins, enolase 1 expressed in the post-diauxic shift and involved in gluconeogenesis showed a marked resistance to oxidation. Whether this means that an evolutionary adaptation to stressing conditions occurs in yeast cells as they age (24Aguilaniu H. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Nyström T. Science. 2003; 299: 1751-1753Google Scholar, 44Laun P. Pichova A. Madeo F. Fuchs J. Ellinger A. Kohlwein S. Dawes I. Fröhlich K.U. Breitenbach M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1166-1173Google Scholar) will deserve future investigations. It has been described that replicative aged cells show markers of oxidative stress (24Aguilaniu H. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Nyström T. Science. 2003; 299: 1751-1753Google Scholar, 44Laun P. Pichova A. Madeo F. Fuchs J. Ellinger A. Kohlwein S. Dawes I. Fröhlich K.U. Breitenbach M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1166-1173Google Scholar). The results presented here obtained from a proteomic analysis revealed that oxidatively modified proteins in replicative aged cells were, interestingly, highly similar to those we found in chronological aging. Five enzymes of the glycolytic pathway were oxidatively damaged. How can such a modification be interpreted with respect to life span? An inactivation of glycolytic enzymes will lead to the impairment of glucose utilization, which correlates with the enhancement of the gluconeogenic and energy storage pathways observed during replicative aging (45Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36000-36007Google Scholar). In addition, reducing glycolysis has proved to increase longevity in several organisms (46Guarente L. Kenyon C. Nature. 2000; 408: 255-262Google Scholar). Therefore, decreased activity of these enzymes on high glucose cultures would act in favor of life span lengthening. Molecular chaperones are involved on protein translocation, folding, and assembly, and their expression is induced in several stresses (47Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgeopoulus C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 457-494Google Scholar). Our results showed that Hsp60, Hsp70s, and Hsp90s became carbonylated under replicative and/or chronological aging. It is reasonable to assume that such modifications would alter their chaperone activity, thus affecting cell survival. This assumption is based on the fact that mutants of mitochondrial Hsp60 are not viable (48Reading D.S. Hallberg R.L. Myers A.M. Nature. 1989; 337: 655-659Google Scholar) and that increased expression of Hsp60 confers a higher resistance to oxidative stress (29Cabiscol E. Bellí G. Tamarit J. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44531-44538Google Scholar). Also, mutations on Hsc82 results in a decrease of chronological life span (49Harris N. MacLean M. Hatzianthis K. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 258-263Google Scholar). Our results also showed that, in chronological aging, actin appeared as a carbonylated protein. Aguilaniu et al. (24Aguilaniu H. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Nyström T. Science. 2003; 299: 1751-1753Google Scholar) propose that actin skeleton is required for proper segregation of oxidized proteins during cytokinesis. This hypothesis is based on both the inhibition of actin assembly by latrunculin A and the atypical spatial distribution of actin in a Δsir2 mutant. In each case, retention of oxidized proteins by mother cells was abolished. Based on these results, oxidative modification of actin provides some clues to explain why replicative life span decreased after passage through the stationary phase (50Ashrafi K. Sinclair D. Gordon J.I. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9100-9105Google Scholar). Calorie restriction has been described to extend life span in several organisms (19Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Google Scholar), including replicative life span in yeast (21Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Google Scholar). With respect to high glucose, the main metabolic change is a shift from fermentation to respiration. The increase in mitochondrial activity then would trigger the formation of ROS, and consequently, antioxidant defenses would be induced. Such mild stress may promote a better adaptation to ROS, explaining the decreased oxidative damage observed in calorie-restricted aged cells (both replicative and chronological). Consistently, resistance to H2O2 was higher in cells grown on 0.5% glucose with respect to those grown on 2% glucose. In replicative aging, the reduction of protein damage observed in 18-generation-old yeast grown on 0.5% glucose was especially relevant for Hsps (Fig. 1). This reduced oxidative damage may work synergically with Sir2p, which is regulated by NAD+/NADH levels, to lengthen life span (22Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Google Scholar). Respiratory metabolism increases this ratio and thus favors Sir2p activity. Chronological life span was also increased on calorie-restricted cells. Additionally, markers of aging such as protein oxidation, TBARS, and lipofuscin as well as iron accumulation were also reduced in these cells. Elucidation of how calorie restriction prevents iron and lipofuscin accumulation could be crucial for understanding the aging of post-mitotic cells. One of the important results described in this paper refers to the different evolution of catalase activity in stationary phase in calorie-restricted versus non-restricted cells (see Fig. 4). The oxidative inactivation observed could be the result of an anomalous reaction between H2O2 and iron in the catalytic center. In fact, irreversible inactivation in the presence of an excess of H2O2 has been described in in vitro assays (51Lardinois O.M. Free Radic. Res. 1995; 22: 251-274Google Scholar). Maintenance of catalase activity in calorie-restricted cells may account for the higher viability observed (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, it has been reported that mutations in ctt1 of S. cerevisiae have a small effect on cell viability in stationary phase (41Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Google Scholar). This apparent contradiction can be attributed to differences in culture conditions. Although in our experiments cells were inoculated in rich medium and cultured without any change, cells were pregrown in synthetic-defined medium and replaced by water at the initial stationary phase as described by Longo et al. (41Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Google Scholar). This could imply a different metabolism, making catalase activity less important. Alternatively, one might consider the altered regulation of antioxidant genes in catalase-deficient cells. It has been reported that overexpression of SOD2 increased SOD1 and catalase activities as a consequence of H2O2 production (52Harris N. Costa V. MacLean M. Mollapour M. Moradas-Ferreira P. Piper P.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1599-1606Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that SOD1 and SOD2 are essential for stationary phase survival, especially the cytosolic isoenzyme (12Fabrizio P. Liou L.L. Moy V.N. Diaspro A. Selvestrone Valentine J. Gralla E.B. Longo V.D. Genetics. 2003; 163: 35-46Google Scholar, 41Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Google Scholar). In accordance with the increased life span of calorie-restricted cells, higher levels of cytosolic SOD activity were found in cells at late stationary phase compared with non-restricted ones. The results described in this paper provide evidence that both aging models can be explained, at least in part, by physiological changes triggered by oxidative damage to specific proteins produced by a stress situation inside the cell. The success of calorie restriction slowing down aging may be attributed to a better preparation of young cells to cope with increased stress situation. This would keep molecular chaperones catalase and SOD functional as the cells grow old. We thank Vanessa Guijarro for excellent technical assistance. We are indebted to Rodney L. Levine for critical review of the paper and helpful suggestions."

Rap is a small GTPase that is closely related to the small GTPase archetype, Ras. Like Ras, Rap cycles between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form. Activation of Rap is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, such as Epac, which catalyze exchange of GDP for GTP. Rap is inactivated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; RAPL, regulator of adhesion and polarization enriched in lymphoid tissues; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; MDCK-Eco, MDCK cells stably expressing the ecotropic receptor; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RalGDS, Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; AJ, adherens junction.1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; RAPL, regulator of adhesion and polarization enriched in lymphoid tissues; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; MDCK-Eco, MDCK cells stably expressing the ecotropic receptor; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RalGDS, Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; AJ, adherens junction. such as RapGAP, which catalyze the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. Rap is activated by a wide variety of extracellular signals. Second messengers including calcium, diacylglycerol, and cAMP directly activate Rap exchange factors and mediate activation of Rap (1Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Rap was first identified in a genome-wide functional screen for proteins that could revert the transformed phenotype of K-Ras (2Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M.

This finding was followed by a number of reports that suggested that Rap antagonized Ras signaling; these reports were based principally on experiments using constitutively active mutants of Rap. However, our subsequent studies did not find evidence for antagonism of Ras signaling by endogenous Rap (3Zwartkruis F.J. Wolthuis R.M. Nabben N.M. Franke B. Bos J.L.

In general, the capacity of integrins to mediate productive adhesion to the extracellular matrix is dependent on both the affinity of integrins for their extracellular matrix ligand and integrin avidity, which relates to the degree of clustering. Rap has been implicated in the modulation of both of these processes (8Kinbara K. Goldfinger L.E. Hansen M. Chou F.L. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 767-776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of proteins have been shown to interact with Rap and are proposed to function as effectors for Rap. These proteins contain a Ras binding domain or structurally related Ras association RA domain (7Bos J.L. de Bruyn K. Enserink J. Kuiperij B. Rangarajan S. Rehmann H. Riedl J. de Rooij J. van Mansfeld F. Zwartkruis F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 83-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, regulator of adhesion and polarization enriched in lymphoid tissues (RAPL) was identified as a protein that interacts with Rap and promotes adhesion in B-cells (9Katagiri K. Maeda A. Shimonaka M. Kinashi T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Another potential candidate is AF-6, which binds both Rap and the actin-binding protein profilin (10Boettner B. Govek E.E. Cross J. Van Aelst L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9064-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To what extent these or other putative Rap effectors mediate the effects of Rap has yet to be firmly established.Cadherins are a large family of transmembrane adhesion molecules that mediate calcium-dependent homotypic adhesion between cells and thus the formation and maintenance of solid tissues (11Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar, 12Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is important for the formation and maintenance of contacts between epithelial cells. The modulation of cadherin-cadherin interactions is critical in normal processes such as morphogenesis and wound healing but can also influence the invasiveness of tumor cells. Indeed, loss or mutation of E-cadherin or associated molecules is a common feature in invasive carcinomas. Cadherins are regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. Strong cell-cell contacts are dependent on the linkage of cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton via catenins and the clustering of cadherins and associated proteins into adherens junctions (13Kemler R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Activation of certain cell-surface receptors, including many growth factor receptors and integrins, results in intracellular signals that either disrupt or strengthen cell-cell contacts (14Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). GTPases of the Rho family (15Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G.

Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 546-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and tyrosine phosphorylation of cadherin and the catenins (17Noe V. Chastre E. Bruyneel E. Gespach C. Mareel M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 65: 43-62PubMed Google Scholar) have been implicated in mediating these responses, although the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Studies in Drosophila showed that loss of the Rap gene resulted in asymmetric positioning of cadherins at cell-cell contact sites, suggesting that Rap may directly modulate cadherin function (18Knox A.L. Brown N.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Dock4, an activator of Rap, which is disrupted in a number of human cancers, was found to enhance the formation of adherens junctions, supporting a role for Rap in cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in mammalian tissues (19Yajnik V. Paulding C. Sordella R. McClatchey A.I. Saito M. Wahrer D.C. Reynolds P. Bell D.W. Lake R. van den Heuvel S. Settleman J. Haber D.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 673-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We have examined the role of Rap in E-cadherin-mediated adhesion. We find that Rap is required for the formation and maintenance of cadherin-mediated adhesion and that this appears to be independent of the effects of Rap on integrins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Plasmids—Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells stably expressing the ecotropic receptor (MDCK-Eco) were provided by Dr. Saskia van Es, The Netherlands Cancer Institute. MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and with 5% CO2. To generate MDCK empty vector and Epac1 stable cell lines, MDCK-Eco cells were infected with Epac1 or empty vector ecotropic virus. 48 h after infection, cells were placed under selection with Zeocin (0.2 mg/ml). The Epac1 gene was linked via an IRES sequence to a Zeocin resistance gene and therefore transcribed onto a single mRNA. Thus, cells resistant to Zeocin can be presumed to express Epac1. Epac expression was stable for a period of at least 8 weeks, the maximum period in which cells were used for experiments. Virus for infections was produced as described previously (20Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 21Michiels F. van der Kammen R.A. Janssen L. Nolan G. Collard J.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 295-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in Phoenix packaging cells that stably expressed Epac1 or vector control. MDCK-GFP-E-cadherin cells were generated similarly using MDCK cells infected with GFP-E-cadherin amphotropic virus, followed by selection on Zeocin. Ras-transformed MDCK cells (f3 cells) (22Mareel M.M. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. De Bruyne G.K. Vleminckx K. Hoogewijs A. Fiers W.C. Van Roy F.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 47: 922-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) were infected with V12Rap amphotropic virus coexpressing GFP, and a positive polyclonal cell pool was obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. OvCar3 cells were obtained from ATCC and were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Canine E-cadherin-human Fc chimeric secretor cells (293-ET7) were provided by Dr. W. J. Nelson (Stanford University) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Chimeric protein was purified from conditioned medium using a 2-ml protein G-Sepharose column (Hi-Trap, Amersham Biosciences), eluted, dialyzed, and concentrated. The chimeras are secreted as dimers, considered to be the minimal functional unit for homotypic E-cadherin interactions (23Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G.

V12Rap1A in LZRS-GFP was from Dr. Rob Roovers, University Medical Centre, Utrecht. Epac1 was subcloned from a PMT2 vector (24de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.

For transient transfections, plasmids RapGAP1, N17Rap1, V12Rap1, and the Ras binding domain of RalGDS were as described previously (3Zwartkruis F.J. Wolthuis R.M. Nabben N.M. Franke B. Bos J.L.

Enserink J.M. Kuiperij H.B. de Rooij J. Price L.S. Schwede F. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). For transient transfection of MDCK cells, 24 h after seeding, cells were washed with PBS and placed in low calcium-containing buffer (PBS with 100 μm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml glucose). Cells were transfected with FuGENE overnight in this buffer and then were refreshed with normal serum-containing medium and cultured for a further 48 h. This approach yielded higher transfection efficiencies compared with transfection in normal medium. For fluorescence microscopy, MDCK cells or MDCK-f3 cells were seeded on glass coverslips. 48 h after seeding, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After blocking for 1 h in PBS with 5% goat serum and 0.2% BSA, Epac was labeled with anti-Epac1 mouse monoclonal antibody 5D3, which was generated in our laboratory, followed by Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody. Cadherins were labeled either with rat anti-E-cadherin (DECMA, Sigma) or with mouse anti-pan-cadherin (Sigma). β-Catenin was labeled with a mouse anti-β-catenin antibody (Transduction Labs). These were followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rat or anti-mouse antibodies. All antibody labelings were performed in PBS and 0.2% BSA. All secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Cells were examined on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope fitted with a Zeiss Axiocam CCD camera or with a confocal microscope (Leica) if indicated. For cell scattering experiments with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), cells were seeded at low density in 6-well tissue culture dishes and grown for 48 h. Cells were stimulated with HGF (Sigma) in the presence or absence of 100 μm 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (4Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). 18 h after treatment, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Phase-contrast images were obtained using a Leica inverted microscope and were photographed.Adhesion Assays—Adhesion assays were performed essentially as described previously (29de Bruyn K.M. Rangarajan S. Reedquist K.A. Figdor C.G. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29468-29476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected as above. 48 h after transfection with a luciferase reporter and the indicated constructs, cells were detached with EDTA (1 mm) at 37 °C and recovered for 1 h in serum-free medium with 0.5% BSA. 5 × 105 cells were added to wells of 96-well Nunc Maxisorp plates that had been precoated with the indicated proteins and left to adhere at 37 °C for 3 h. Wells were washed three times with wash buffer (PBS, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2) and lysed, and luciferase was measured as described previously (28Rangarajan S. Enserink J.M. Kuiperij H.B. de Rooij J. Price L.S. Schwede F. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Wells were coated with fibronectin (5 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C and blocked with 1% heat-denatured BSA. For E-cadherin binding, wells were coated overnight with 10 μg/ml goat anti-Fc (Jackson Laboratories) and blocked with 1% heat-denatured BSA, followed by incubation with 50 ng/ml recombinant Fc-E-cadherin.Rap1 Activation Assays and Immunoblotting—Rap1 was assayed as described previously (30Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and active Rap was precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads precoupled to a GST fusion protein of the Ras binding domain of RalGDS. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and solubilized in SDS sample buffer. A portion of the cell lysate was reserved for analysis of total Rap content. Rap1 was detected following Western blotting with anti-Rap1 antibodies, which recognize both Rap1A and Rap1B isoforms, but not Rap2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Epac1 in total cell lysates was detected with monoclonal antibody 5D3. MAP kinase activity was determined with a phosphospecific MAP kinase antibody (Cell Signaling Technology).RESULTSActivated Rap Promotes Cadherin-mediated Cell-Cell Contacts in Mesenchymal Ras-transformed MDCK Cells—To examine the role of Rap in homotypic cadherin interactions, we examined the effects of expression of constitutively active Rap1A on the morphology of Ras-transformed MDCK-f3 cells (f3 cells) (17Noe V. Chastre E. Bruyneel E. Gespach C. Mareel M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 65: 43-62PubMed Google Scholar). Despite expression of E-cadherin, f3 cells failed to form significant cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts and displayed a mesenchymal phenotype. Stable expression of V12Rap1A by retroviral transduction resulted in a phenotypic reversion of the Ras-transformed phenotype toward that of wild type MDCK cells. Thus, cells lost their fibroblastoid phenotype and instead grew in tightly packed colonies (Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that consistent with this phenotypic change was an accumulation of cadherin and β-catenin at sites of cell-cell contact (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis with antiphosphospecific MAP kinase antibodies showed that there was no effect of stable expression of the constitutively active Rap1 on MAP kinase activation and therefore that V12Rap1 did not exert its effects on cell morphology by antagonizing oncogenic Ras signaling (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we detected no difference in the expression levels of a variety of different cadherin isoforms between wild type and V12Rap1-expressing f3 cells (not shown). We conclude that constitutive Rap1 activation induces the restoration of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesions and reversion of the Ras-transformed phenotype of MDCK-f3 cells.Endogenous Rap Signaling Antagonizes HGF-induced Cell Scattering—To examine the effect of activation of endogenous Rap on cells, we generated MDCK cells in which the level of Rap activation could be directly regulated. To do this, we used retroviral induction to stably express Epac1, an exchange factor for Rap that is regulated by cAMP. Epac1 was found to be stably expressed as determined by Western blotting of cell extracts and by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal anti-Epac1 antibody (Fig. 2). We recently described the use of a cAMP analog, 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, which specifically activates Epac without activating protein kinase A (4Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Thus, Rap1 activity could be stimulated with 8CPT-2Me-cAMP in Epac1-expressing MDCK cells, but not in empty vector-expressing cells, which do not express detectable levels of Epac1 (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence studies showed that Epac1 was expressed to varying levels in the polyclonal cell population and was localized predominantly at the plasma membrane, being particularly apparent at cell-cell junctions. The expression of Epac did not result in a discernable effect on E-cadherin distribution, nor did Rap activation produce such an effect when induced by overnight treatment with 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Expression of Epac1 in MDCK cells.A, polyclonal MDCK cells stably expressing either empty vector or Epac1 coupled to a Zeocin resistance gene were treated with or without 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (8CPT-cAMP). Western blots show levels of active Rap1 precipitated from cell lysates, total Rap1 (active and inactive) present in cell lysates, and Epac1. Note that Epac1 is undetectable in empty vector-expressing cells. 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (100 μm) induced Rap1 activation specifically in cells expressing Epac1. B, immunofluorescence images of empty vector MDCK cells and cells expressing Epac1, labelled with anti-E-cadherin or anti-Epac1 antibodies. Cells expressing Epac1 were treated with and without 8CPT-2Me-cAMP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further examine the role of endogenous Rap in cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, we examined the effect of increased Rap activity on HGF-induced responses in MDCK cells. HGF treatment of empty vector control cells resulted in the reduction of cell-cell contacts, cell flattening, and acquisition of a migratory phenotype (Fig. 3A, middle panels). These morphological changes were less pronounced in cells expressing Epac, which have a higher basal level of Rap activity. Treatment with the Epac activator 8CPT-2Me-cAMP strongly suppressed HGF-induced morphological changes in Epac1-expressing cells, but had no effect on the HGF-induced response in control cells (Fig. 3A, lower panels). Consistent with these results, immunofluorescence studies showed that HGF treatment led to the reduction of E-cadherin staining at cell-cell contacts and its internalization into intracellular vesicles. Activation of Epac with 8CPT-2Me-cAMP suppressed the HGF-induced loss of E-cadherin from cell-cell junctions, most visibly in those cells expressing higher levels of Epac1 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that increased activity of endogenous Rap suppresses HGF-induced disruption of cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts and acquisition of a migratory phenotype.Fig. 3Rap activation suppresses HGF-induced disruption of adherens junctions.A, MDCK cells grown on tissue culture dishes expressing either empty vector or Epac1 were stimulated with HGF (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (8CPT-cAMP) (100 μm). 24 h after stimulation, cells were fixed and visualized. Note that Epac1 cells treated with 8CPT-2Me-cAMP are resistant to HGF-induced morphological changes (compare lower panels). B, E-cadherin staining at cell-cell junctions is preserved in Epac-expressing cells treated with 8CPT-2Me-cAMP. Epac1-expressing cells were stimulated with HGF in the presence or absence of 8CPT-2Me-cAMP. Cells were fixed and stained with anti-E-cadherin or anti-Epac1 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Activation of c-Met, the cell-surface receptor for HGF, results in activation of a number of intracellular cell signaling pathways that ultimately promote the disruption of cadherin-cadherin adhesions. To determine whether Epac-Rap activation resulted in reduced signaling by c-Met, e.g. because of receptor internalization or reduced expression, we examined the effects on HGF-induced MAP kinase activation. Stimulation of cells with HGF resulted in an equal induction of MAP kinase phosphorylation in both empty vector and Epac1-expressing MDCK cells (Fig. 4). Furthermore, MAP kinase phosphorylation was not affected by activation of Epac-Rap signaling by 8CPT-2Me-cAMP. These results suggest that Rap activation does not prevent HGF-induced disruption of adherens junctions by suppressing signaling by c-Met or activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. HGF stimulation did not stimulate Rap1 activation in MDCK cells. Indeed, in some experiments, such as that shown in Fig. 4, Rap1 activation was reduced following HGF treatment, although this was not a consistent observation.Fig. 4Rap activation does not perturb c-Met signaling. MDCK cells stably expressing either empty vector or Epac1 were treated for 15 min with 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (8CPT-cAMP) to activate Epac and Rap. Cells were then stimulated with or without HGF for a further 15 min. Cell lysates were analyzed for both active Rap1 and total Rap1 as above and were analyzed for phosphorylated MAP kinase (phospho-MAPK) using a phosphospecific anti-MAP kinase antibody. Lysates were also analyzed for Epac1 levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Rap1 Activity Is Required for the Maintenance of Adherens Junctions—The above results suggest that increased Rap activation promotes cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. To examine whether Rap activation is required for cadherin-mediated adhesion, we first studied the effects of Rap inhibition on the distribution of E-cadherin in OvCar3 ovarian carcinoma cells. Expression of the Rap GTPase activating protein Rap-GAP1, an inhibitor of Rap activity, induced a marked reduction in E-cadherin levels at the sites of cell-cell interaction. Indeed, cell-cell contacts were often broken between RapGAP-expressing cells and often resulted in the acquisition of a migratory phenotype (Fig. 5A). Expression of a dominant negative mutant of Rap1, N17Rap1, led to a similar loss of E-cadherin staining at cell-cell junctions (not shown). This suggests that Rap signaling is required for the maintenance of cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts. Expression of a constitutively active Rap1 mutant, V12Rap1A, did not result in obvious changes in the distribution of E-cadherin (not shown).Fig. 5Inhibition of Rap suppresses E-cadherin-mediated adhesion.A, expression of Rap1GAP1 inhibits cell-cell contact in OvCar3 cells. Cells were co-transfected with Rap1GAP1 and GFP to identify transfected cells, fixed, and stained with anti-E-cadherin antibodies. B, adhesion to Fc-E-cadherin. MDCK cells were added to wells coated with Fc-E-cadherin (E) or fibronectin (Fn) in the presence of 1.8 mm CaCl2 (+) or 50 μm CaCl2 (–), a calcium concentration that does not support E-cadherin-mediated adhesion. The number of adherent cells/microscopic field is presented (n = 4; ±S.D.).

Chem.</i> 278, 12305–12309). As a first step toward obtaining three-dimensional information about this large complex or ""metabolon"" and the locations of PIC and ANC therein, we dispersed ATP synthasomes into single complexes and visualized negatively stained images by electron microscopy (EM) that showed clearly the classical headpiece, central stalk, and basepiece. Parallel immuno-EM studies revealed the presence of PIC and ANC located non-centrally in the basepiece, and other studies implicated an ATP synthase/PIC/ANC stoichiometry near 1:1:1. Single ATP synthasome images (7506) were boxed, and, using EMAN software, a three-dimensional model was obtained at a resolution of 23 Å. Significantly, the basepiece is oblong and contains two domains, the larger of which connects to the central stalk, whereas the smaller appears as an extension. Docking studies with known structures together with the immuno-EM studies suggest that PIC or ANC may be located in the smaller domain, whereas the other transporter resides nearby in the larger domain. Collectively, these finding support a mechanism in which the entry of the substrates ADP and P<sub>i</sub> into mitochondria, the synthesis of ATP on F<sub>1</sub>, and the release and exit of ATP are very localized and highly coordinated events."
https://openalex.org/W2129879745,"The molecular mechanisms involved in the hepatic tropism of hepatitis C virus (HCV) have not been identified. We have shown previously that liver-expressed C-type lectins L-SIGN and DC-SIGN bind the HCV E2 glycoprotein with high affinity (Lozach, P.

To analyze the functional relevance of this interaction, we generated pseudotyped lentivirus particles presenting HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2 at the virion surface (HCV-pp). High mannose N-glycans are present on E1 and, to a lesser extent, on E2 proteins of mature infectious HCV-pp. Such particles bind to both L-SIGN and DC-SIGN, but they cannot use these receptors for entry into cells. However, infectious virus is transmitted efficiently when permissive Huh-7 cells are cocultured with HCV-pp bound to L-SIGN or to DC-SIGN-positive cell lines. HCV-pp transmission via L-SIGN or DC-SIGN is inhibited by characteristic inhibitors such as the calcium chelator EGTA and monoclonal antibodies directed against lectin carbohydrate recognition domains of both lectins. In support of the biological relevance of this phenomenon, dendritic cells expressing endogenous DC-SIGN transmitted HCV-pp with high efficiency in a DC-SIGN-dependent manner.

How HCV reaches hepatocytes, the principal site of virus replication, is not clear. Several cellular proteins have been proposed to act as receptors for HCV on hepatocytes including CD81, scavenger receptor class B, type I, and the low density lipoprotein receptor (1Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M. Rosa D. Grandi G. Abrignani S. Science. 1998; 282: 938-941Google Scholar, 2Scarselli E. Ansuini H. Cerino R.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12766-12771Google Scholar), but these cellular proteins are not sufficient to mediate viral entry into target cells (4Bartosch B. Vitelli A. Granier C. Goujon C. Dubuisson J. Pascale S. Scarselli E. Cortese R. Nicosia A. Cosset F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41624-41630Google Scholar). Furthermore, they are expressed on several cell types in vivo and therefore cannot explain the hepatic tropism of HCV. HCV in blood can diffuse freely into the liver. However, it is likely that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) represent an obstacle to passive diffusion from the blood into the hepatic tissue. LSEC prevent access of leukocytes to hepatocytes (5Limmer A. Sacher T. Alferink J. Kretschmar M. Schonrich G. Nichterlein T. Arnold B. Hammerling G.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2395-2406Google Scholar) and limit the passage of molecules larger than 12 nm in diameter from the sinusoidal lumen to hepatocytes (6Kempka G. Kolb-Bachofen V. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 176: 38-48Google Scholar). Thus, passive diffusion through the fenestrated liver endothelium seems unlikely to mediate rapid and efficient hepatocyte targeting by HCV (mean diameter superior to 50 nm). LSEC seem to play a role in the capture and concentration of hepatotropic viruses such as Duck Hepatitis B virus before their transmission to neighboring hepatocytes (7Breiner K.M. Schaller H. Knolle P.A. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 803-808Google Scholar). Duck Hepatitis B virus whose envelope proteins are glycosylated (8Swameye I. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9434-9441Google Scholar) can be detected in the LSEC of infected ducks several hours after infection. C-type lectins-like L-SIGN might be the receptor responsible for liver-specific retention of enveloped hepatotropic viruses. L-SIGN is highly expressed in LSEC (9Bashirova A.A. Geijtenbeek T.B. van Duijnhoven G.C. van Vliet S.J. Eilering J.B. Martin M.P. Wu L. Martin T.D. Viebig N. Knolle P.A. KewalRamani V.N. van Kooyk Y. Carrington M. J. Exp.

A. 2001; 98: 2670-2675Google Scholar) but not in hepatocytes. Furthermore, the related molecule, DC-SIGN, is detected in the liver in Kupffer cells (11Schwartz A.J. Alvarez X. Lackner A.A. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2002; 18: 1021-1029Google Scholar), which are immobile liver macrophages localized close to LSEC and hepatocytes. L-SIGN and DC-SIGN act as pathogen-recognition receptors (12Van Kooyk Y. Geijtenbeek T.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 697-709Google Scholar) and share 77% sequence homology. The principal characteristic of these C-type lectins is that they interact with mannose residues of glycoproteins in a calcium-dependent manner via their C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (13Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Google Scholar, 14Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Google Scholar). Several motifs localized in their cytoplasmic domain could be involved in the internalization of the lectin by endocytosis and its recycling toward the plasma membrane (12Van Kooyk Y. Geijtenbeek T.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 697-709Google Scholar). Several viruses including HCV bind to these lectins via their envelope glycoproteins (15Alvarez C.P. Lasala F. Carrillo J. Muniz O. Corbi A.L. Delgado R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6841-6844Google Scholar, 16Halary F. Amara A. Lortat-Jacob H. Messerle M. Delaunay T. Houles C. Fieschi F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Moreau J.F.

Recently, DC-SIGN has been shown to mediate the infection of dendritic cells (DC) and a DC-SIGN expressing cell line by the Dengue virus, another member of the flaviviridae and Flavivirus (18Navarro-Sanchez E.

HCV E1 and E2 surface glycoproteins are naturally retained in the endoplasmic reticulum via their transmembrane domains and carry 6 and 11 high mannose N-glycans, respectively (20Cocquerel L. Duvet S. Meunier J.C. Pillez A. Cacan R. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2641-2649Google Scholar, 21Cocquerel L. Meunier J.C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J.

A. 2003; 100: 4498-4503Google Scholar) reported that the HCV glycoproteins and virions contained in the sera of HCV patients were captured by L-SIGN and DC-SIGN. The high mannosylated glycoform of HCV E2 binds to L-SIGN and DC-SIGN with high affinity (kd = 6 and 3 nm, respectively) (23Lozach P.Y. Lortat-Jacob H. de Lacroix de Lavalette A. Staropoli I. Foung S. Amara A. Houles C. Fieschi F. Schwartz O. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Altmeyer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20358-20366Google Scholar). However, due to the lack of an efficient culture system and purified HCV virions, no information is available on the glycosylation status of E1 and E2 on mature infectious HCV virions or on the functional relevance of these interactions. In this study, we investigated the role of L-SIGN and DC-SIGN in viral entry and transmission to hepatocytes using pseudotyped lentivirus particles carrying functional E1 and E2 glycoproteins (26Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Google Scholar, 27Hsu M. Zhang J. Flint M. Logvinoff C. Cheng-Mayer C. Rice C.M. McKeating J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our results show that HCV-pp can interact with L-SIGN or DC-SIGN in a different manner compared with other viruses and that L-SIGN may act as a tissue-specific capture receptor for HCV. Reagents and Antibodies—Murine monoclonal antibodies (mAb) A4, A11, and H52 are directed against linear epitopes of E1 (A4) and E2 (A11 and H52) glycoproteins. Polyclonal human antibody New Lav Blot is directed against all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proteins including the p24 core protein. Phycoerythrin-conjugated murine mAbs anti-DC-SIGN (FAb161P), anti-L-SIGN (FAb162P), and anti-L-SIGN/anti-DC-SIGN (FAb1621P) were purchased from R&D Systems. Murine mAbs anti-L-SIGN/anti-DC-SIGN (mAb1621) and anti-L-SIGN (mAb162) were also purchased from R&D Systems. 1B10 is a DC-SIGN murine mAb directed against a conformational epitope of the DC-SIGN CRD and was described previously (16Halary F. Amara A. Lortat-Jacob H. Messerle M. Delaunay T. Houles C. Fieschi F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Moreau J.F. Dechanet-Merville J. Immunity. 2002; 17: 653-664Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse mAb anti-CD14 (MϕP9) and anti-CD1a (HI149) were purchased from BD Biosciences. As controls, mouse isotypic antibodies IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG1-fluorescein isothiocyanate, IgG2b-fluorescein isothiocyanate, and IgG2b-phycoerythrin were used. Envelope Proteins, Packaging, and Transfer Vector Constructs—The p8.71 HIV packaging construct, encoding the HIV gag and pol genes, and the pTrip-GFP and pTrip-luciferase plasmids, encoding an HIV-based transfer vector containing a CMV-GFP or a CMV-luciferase internal transcriptional unit, respectively, were described previously (Fig. 1A) (29Yee J.K.

The pCDNA3-VSVG (vesicular stomatitis virus G protein) and phCMV-cE1E2 expression vectors encode the VSVG protein and the E1 and E2 glycoproteins from a HCV 1a genotype, respectively (Fig. 1A) (26Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Google Scholar). The plasmid coding for the env gene of the JR-cerebral spinal fluid isolate was used to produce HIV pseudoparticles (HIV-pp) (32Amara A. Vidy A. Boulla G. Mollier K. Garcia-Perez J. Alcami J. Blanpain C. Parmentier M. Virelizier J.L. Charneau P. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2550-2558Google Scholar). It codes for an HIV genome in which the Nef gene has been replaced by a luciferase reporter gene. Cell Lines and C-type Lectin Expression—Huh-7 is an adherent human hepatocytic cell line, and HEK293T is a human kidney cell line. Both cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. BTHP1 cells are non-adherent human Raji B cells, previously misidentified as THP1 cells (33Wu L. Martin T.D. Carrington M. KewalRamani V.N. Virology. 2004; 318: 17-23Google Scholar). BTHP1 cells expressing L-SIGN (BTHP1-LS) were generated by transduction with the retroviral pTrip vector expressing L-SIGN. The pCDNA3-L-SIGN (DC-SIGNR) sequence was digested by BamHI (5′) and XhoI (3′) and inserted into the pTrip vector. BTHP1, BTHP1-LS, and BTHP1 expressing DC-SIGN (BTHP1-DCS) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All of the products used for cell culture were from Invitrogen. Purification of Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) and Dendritic Cells—Human PBMC were isolated from healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll (Amersham Biosciences). Monocytes were negatively selected with magnetic beads coated with a mixture of antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec). They were seeded at 106 cells·ml–1 and subsequently cultured in fresh RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 50 ng·ml–1 recombinant human interleukin-4 (PeproTech), and 800 units·ml–1 recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Schering-Plough) for 6 days. Differentiation of dendritic cells (DC) was assessed by FACS analysis using CD14 down-regulation and CD1a up-regulation as parameters. For enhancement assays, isolated PBMC were cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% FCS medium containing phytohemagglutinin (3 μg·ml–1, Murex) and interleukin-2 (10 units·ml–1, Chiron) for 3 days as previously described (32Amara A. Vidy A. Boulla G. Mollier K. Garcia-Perez J. Alcami J. Blanpain C. Parmentier M. Virelizier J.L. Charneau P. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2550-2558Google Scholar). They were then seeded at 106 cells·ml–1 and subsequently cultured in fresh RPMI 1640 medium containing interleukin-2 (10 units·ml–1). Production and Purification of Pseudotyped Lentivirus Particles— HEK293T cells were seeded 1 day before transfection at 2.5 × 106 cells in a 10-cm plate in 10 ml of DMEM, 10% FCS. Medium was replaced 3 h before transfection by fresh medium (10 ml). Cells were transfected using a standard phosphate calcium transfection method (Clontech). The transfecting DNA mixture (1 ml) was composed of 8 μg of p8.71, 8 μg of pTrip-GFP or pTrip-luciferase, and 5 μg of glycoprotein(s) encoding plasmid. HCV-pp and VSV-pp correspond to lentivirus particles pseudotyped with HCV E1 and E2 glycoproteins and VSVG glycoprotein, respectively (Fig. 1A). For Δenv-pseudotyped lentivirus particles (Δenv-pp), the amount of envelope-encoding plasmid was replaced by the same amount of p8.71 plasmid (13 μg total). Medium was replaced 16 h after transfection by DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (8 ml). To produce HCV-pp carrying high mannose N-glycans (HCV-ppDMJ), α-mannosidase I and II inhibitors 1-deoxymannojirimycin hydrochloride (DMJ, 1 mm, Calbiochem) and swainsonine (5 mm, Sigma) were added. For the production of 35S-labeled HCV-pp, the medium was supplemented with 200 μCi·ml–1 [35S]cysteine and methionine (Pro-Mix 35S, Amersham Biosciences). HCV-pp were harvested in culture supernatants 24 h after transfection. Supernatants were cleared by centrifugation and filtered through 0.45-μm pore-sized membranes. HCV-pp were purified by ultracentrifugation through a 2.5-ml 20% sucrose cushion in a Beckman SW 28 rotor (28000 rpm; 2 h, 30 min; 4 °C). Virus was concentrated 100 times in FCS-free DMEM, and the p24 antigen content was determined with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunodetection of Cell Surface Antigens—L-SIGN and DC-SIGN were detected by FACS using phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-L-SIGN (FAb162P), anti-DC-SIGN (FAb161P), and anti-L-SIGN/anti-DC-SIGN (FAb1621P) antibodies. CD14 and CD1a were detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD14 (MϕP9) and anti-CD1a (HI149). Cells were washed in FCS-free DMEM and resuspended in A buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% γ-globulin, and 0,1% sodium azide (all from Sigma)) followed by incubation with antibodies at a 1:100 dilution for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and fixed with paraformaldehyde (3.2%, Electron Microscopy Sciences) prior to FACS analysis (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) and data-processed with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Glycosylation of HCV-pp Proteins—HCV-pp (6 μg of p24 equivalent) were submitted to a 20–60% sucrose density gradient (10 ml) using a Beckman SW 41 rotor (40,000 rpm; 18 h; 4 °C). Fractions (500 μl) were collected and analyzed (18 μl) directly by Western blotting. Purified HCV-pp or HCV-ppDMJ extracts (200 ng of p24 equivalent) were denatured in 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 5 min followed by an overnight incubation at 37 °C in G7 buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, New England Biolabs), Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, New England Biolabs) containing endoglycosidase H (2 milliunits of Endo H, Roche Applied Science) or peptide N-glycosidase F (1000 U of PNGase F, New England Biolabs). HCV-pp subjected to the same procedure in the absence of PNGase F or Endo H were used as a control. Protein extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris gels, Invitrogen) and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). Incubation with primary antibodies A11 (anti-E2; 2 μg·ml–1), H52 (anti-E2; 2 μg ml–1), A4 (anti-E1; 2 μg·ml–1), and New Lav Blot (anti-HIV, 1:200) was followed by incubation with an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, NA931V (Amersham Biosciences) (1:1000). Bound antibodies were detected by exposure to enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL+, Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by a video acquisition system (Intelligent Dark Box II, Fuji) and Image Gauge software (Fuji). Cell Infection with HCV-pp—Adherent cells (5 × 104) were plated in 12-well plates 24 h before infection in DMEM containing 10% FCS. 105 cells were washed three times with FCS-free medium, and 300 μl of diluted pseudotyped retroviral particles in FCS-free DMEM were added for 1 h at 37 °C under gentle agitation every 15 min without the addition of facilitating reagents such as DEAE-dextran or Polybrene. Subsequently, 300 μl of DMEM containing 10% FCS were added. 16 h later, viral inoculum was removed and replaced with 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were harvested 52 h later. When GFP was used as the reporter gene, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (3,2%) and positive GFP cells were analyzed by FACScan (FAC-SCalibur, BD Biosciences). When luciferase was used as a reporter gene, cells were harvested in 150 μl of lysis B buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 15% v/v glycerol) and 50 μl of lysis extract were measured in substrate B buffer containing 1 mm luciferin (Sigma) and 20 mm ATP (Sigma) in a Lumat LB 9501 (Berthold) to determinate the luciferase activity. Binding of HCV-pp and HCV-ppDMJ to DC-SIGN and L-SIGN— Binding assays were performed on 106 BTHP1, BTHP1-LS, BTHP1-DCS, or dendritic cells in 200 μl of C buffer (RPMI 1640 medium without FCS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2) in 96-well plates. Cells were incubated with 35S-labeled HCV-pp (30 ng of p24 equivalent) for 3 h at 37 °C under gentle shaking. Virus-cell mixtures were then transferred to a new plate, and unbound radioactivity was removed by five washes with C buffer. Cell pellets were resuspended in C buffer prior to the addition of Optiphase Supermix solution (Wallac), and bound radioactivity was counted in a 1450 Microbeta Trilux γ counter (Wallac). For binding inhibition assays, cells were preincubated with inhibitors in C buffer for 30 min at 4 °C before the addition of labeled particles containing inhibitor. Inhibitors were used at a final concentration of 20 μg·ml–1 for mannan (Sigma), 1B10, MAb1621, and isotype control IgG or at 5 mm for EGTA (Sigma). HCV-pp-specific binding to BTHP1, BTHP1-DCS, BTHP1-LS, or dendritic cells was calculated as shown in Equation 1. Bound cpm from HCV-pp−Bound cpm from Δenv-pp (Eq. 1) HCV-pp and HCV-ppDMJ Transmission by DC, BTHP1-LS, and BTHP1-DCS Cells—Huh-7 cells (5 × 104) were plated 1 day before transmission in 12-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Before coculture, cells were washed three times with FCS-free medium and incubated in 300 μl of FCS-free DMEM. HCV-pp (150–300 ng of p24 equivalent) were incubated with BTHP1, BTHP1-LS, BTHP1-DCS, or dendritic cells (106) as described. Cells were resuspended in 300 μlof DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and added to Huh-7 cells. Co-culture was carried out for 68 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times followed by the harvesting and FACScan analysis or luciferase activity measurement as described. Virus transmission results were calculated as follows: 1) GFP(+) cells in coculture × 100/GFP(+) cells following direct infection with the same amount of HCV-pp and 2) RLU in coculture × 100/RLU following direct infection with same amount of HCV-pp. Enhancement of HCV-pp and HIV-pp infection by L-SIGN and DC-SIGN were tested using Huh-7 and activated PBMC target cells, respectively. Huh-7 cells (2.5 × 104) were plated in 24-well plate in DMEM and 10% FCS 24 h before transmission. BTHP1, BTHP1-LS, BTHP1-DCS, or dendritic cells (5 × 105) were incubated with low and otherwise non-infectious quantities of HCV-pp, HCV-ppDMJ (50 ng of p24 equivalent) or with HIV-pp as described previously (34Kwon D.S. Gregorio G. Bitton N. Hendrickson W.A. Littman D.R. Immunity. 2002; 16: 135-144Google Scholar) for 3 h at 37 °C. The DC, BTHP1, BTHP1-LS, and BTHP1-DCS virus mixture then was directly added to Huh-7 cells or activated human T lymphocytes cells (5 × 104). Co-culture was carried out for 68 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times prior to lysis in buffer B and luciferase activity measurement as described previously. Characterization of Functional HCV-pp—To study the interactions between HCV and L-SIGN or DC-SIGN, we produced lentivirus-pseudotyped particles carrying unmodified HCV E1 and E2 glycoproteins (Fig. 1A) (26Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Google Scholar, 27Hsu M. Zhang J. Flint M. Logvinoff C. Cheng-Mayer C. Rice C.M. McKeating J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7271-7276Google Scholar, 28Drummer H.E. Maerz A. Poumbourios P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 385-390Google Scholar). The E1 and E2 lentivirus pseudotype particles, HCV-pp, were biologically functional because they could infect the hepatocytic cell line Huh-7 as evidenced by the expression of either a GFP (Fig. 1B) or a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 1C). Non-infectious lentivirus viral particles lacking surface glycoprotein (Δenv-pp) were used as negative controls. Lentivirus particles carrying the G envelope protein of VSV were used as positive controls (VSV-pp). HCV-pp were separated on a sucrose gradient, and fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting. The E1 protein was distributed in fractions in which neither E2 nor HIV core protein could be significantly detected (Fig. 2A). The fractions in which E1 protein was detected alone might correspond to lipid droplets carrying E1 protein. Infectious HCV-pp was present only in fractions where E1, E2, and HIV p24 core protein colocalized (Fig. 2A). No E1 or E2 protein was detected in Δenv-pp or supernatant of cells transfected with E1 and E2 protein coding plasmids alone (data not shown). The subcellular compartment of HCV budding, i.e. where E1/E2 heterocomplexes interact with cores to form virus particles, and the presence of highly mannosylated or complex N-glycans on the HCV virion have not been determined. In agreement with a previous report (28Drummer H.E. Maerz A. Poumbourios P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 385-390Google Scholar), the HCV-pp-associated E2 is partially resistant to Endo H, indicating the N-glycan modification by Golgi-resident enzymes (Fig. 2B). To simulate a situation in which HCV N-glycans are not modified in the Golgi, we generated HCV-pp in the presence of swainsonine and DMJ, which inhibit Golgi α-mannosidases and therefore prevent complex glycosylation. The infectivity of these heavily mannosylated particles (HCV-ppDMJ) in Huh-7 cells was similar to that of HCV-pp produced in the absence of swainsonine and DMJ (data not shown). As expected, HCV-ppDMJ E2 glycoprotein remains completely sensitive to Endo H, demonstrating that it is highly mannosylated (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, E1 proteins on HCV-pp and HCV-ppDMJ had the same glycosylation pattern (Fig. 2, B and C). We concluded that the upper band observed for E1 after Endo H treatment was a carbohydrate residue, which is not accessible to Endo H enzyme, and was not a complex carbohydrate residue. Our data suggest that during HCV-pp maturation, all of the E1 N-glycans and a minor fraction of E2 N-glycans remain inaccessible to glycosylation-modifying enzymes. HCV-pp and HCV-ppDMJ represent two glycosylation profiles of functional HCV E1 and E2 proteins that may be present on wild type virions. Therefore, HCV-pp and HCV-ppDMJ are tools of choice to explore the biochemical correlations of a functional interaction of HCV with C-type lectin receptors. HCV-pp and HCV-ppDMJ Bind to L-SIGN and DC-SIGN—We previously reported that soluble HCV E2 protein binds to L-SIGN and DC-SIGN with high affinity (23Lozach P.Y. Lortat-Jacob H. de Lacroix de Lavalette A. Staropoli I. Foung S. Amara A. Houles C. Fieschi F. Schwartz O. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Altmeyer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20358-20366Google Scholar). To study interactions between these lectins and functional E1 and E2 proteins on HCV-pp, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN were expressed on the surface of BTHP1 human cell line (BTHP1-LS and BTHP1-DCS, respectively) (Fig. 3A). Dendritic cells, which express DC-SIGN, were also differentiated from human PBMC. CD14 down-regulation and CD1a up-regulation confirmed the differentiation into DC (Fig. 8A). Δenv-pp and Δenv-ppDMJ (produced in the presence of swainsonine and DMJ) did not bind to BTHP1 and BTHP1-LS but interacted weakly with BTHP1-DCS or dendritic cells. Δenv-pp (or Δenv-ppDMJ), which does not incorporate viral glycoproteins, was used to define background values. Both 35S-labeled HCV-pp and HCV-ppDMJ bound to BTHP1-LS and BTHP1-DCS but not to control cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, DC-SIGN expressed on DC bound HCV-pp and HCV-ppDMJ (Fig. 8B).

To investigate the detailed bioenergetics of the in situ mitochondria, a method is described to monitor continuously the respiration of primary cerebellar granule neuron cultures while simultaneously imaging cytoplasmic Ca(2+) and mitochondrial membrane potential. Coverslip-attached cells were perfused in an imaging chamber with upstream and downstream flow-through oxygen electrodes. The bioenergetic consequences of chronic glutamate exposure were investigated, including ATP supply and demand, proton leak, and mitochondrial respiratory capacity during chronic glutamate exposure. In 25 mM K(+) medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed serum, cells utilized 54% of their respiratory capacity in the absence of receptor activation (37% for ATP generation, 12% to drive the mitochondrial proton leak, and the residual 5% was nonmitochondrial). glutamate initially increased mitochondrial respiration from 51 to 68% of capacity, followed by a slow decline. It was estimated that 85% of this increased respiration was because of increased ATP demand, whereas 15% was attributable to a transient mitochondrial proton leak. N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation was only responsible for 62% of the increased respiration. When adjusted for cell death over 3 h of glutamate exposure, respiration of the viable cells remained near basal and protonophore stimulated respiration to the same extent as control cells. Pyruvate-supplemented media protected cells from glutamate excitotoxicity, although this was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that excitotoxicity under these conditions is not because of an ATP deficit or uncoupling. Furthermore, mitochondria maintain the same respiratory capacity as in control cells."

This leads to cascades of intracellular signaling that result in the regulation of various cellular activities. However, the molecular mechanism of RAFTK autophosphorylation is not yet known.

In addition, overexpression of kinase-mutated RAFTK inhibited wild type RAFTK autophosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner by a trans-acting interaction. Trans-acting autophosphorylation was also observed between endogenous and exogenous RAFTK upon potassium depolarization of neuroendocrine PC12 cells.

RAFTK transduces key extracellular signals through tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to various cellular responses, and is also implicated in the regulation of numerous cellular activities (5Girault J.A.

Analyses of FAK activation events have shown that phosphorylation of FAK occurs at six sites in vivo: two sites (Tyr397 and Tyr407) within the FAK N-terminal region; two sites (Tyr576 and Tyr577) within the kinase domain activation loop; and two sites (Tyr861 and Tyr925) within the C-terminal region. Four FAK tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Tyr397, Tyr576, Tyr577, and Tyr925) are conserved at analogous positions in RAFTK (Tyr402, Tyr579, Tyr580, and Tyr881). Among these four tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr402 is known to be autophosphorylated (2Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J.

Although the autophosphorylation of RAFTK is reported to play an important role in various systems, the detailed mechanism of this event, such as the nature and sites of its autophosphorylation, are unknown. In this study, we focused on the following questions: 1) Is the autophosphorylation of RAFTK a cis- or trans-acting event? 2) What are the essential components needed for RAFTK autophosphorylation? 3) Is Tyr402 the only autophosphorylation site? 4) Is RAFTK self-associated similar to the heterodimerization of other receptor-type tyrosine kinases? Better understanding of the initial steps of RAFTK activation will provide insights into RAFTK-mediated cellular functions, such as cell adhesion and migration, stress response, and induction of neuronal long term potentiation.

A kinase-negative mutant of RAFTK (KM) was constructed by replacing Lys475 with an Ala residue using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A point mutant of RAFTK (Y402F) was also constructed by replacing Tyr402 with a Phe residue using site-directed mutagenesis. The GFP-tagged wild type (WT) or kinase mutant (KM) RAFTK was subsequently prepared by subcloning the RAFTK construct as an EcoRI/EcoRI fragment in-frame at the 3′ end of a GFP tag in a pEGFP-C3 vector, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech).

PC12 cells, SYF, and SYF + Src cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated plates a day before transfection and then transiently transfected with various cDNA constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The cell lysates were prepared with modified RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies as indicated. The immunoprecipitates were washed and analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation as described below. Transient Transfection of HEK 293 Cells—Transient transfection of cDNA constructs into HEK 293 cells was performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Empty vector cDNA was used as a transfection control. After 24 or 48 h of transfection, the cells were examined for expression of the tagged GFP proteins under an immunofluorescent microscope. The cell lysates were prepared with modified RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies, followed by immunoblotting as described below. Preparation of Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblotting—The cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm Na3VO4 and 1 mm NaF). Immunoprecipitations were performed with the indicated antibodies, followed by protein G incubation. The immunoprecipitates were separated by either 8% SDS-PAGE or 7% Tris-acetate-NuPAGE (Novex, San Diego, CA) under reducing conditions, electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and processed for immunoblotting using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Biosciences). Levels of tyrosine phosphorylation, Tyr402-specific phosphorylation, and the amounts of RAFTK protein were quantified using a software program for densitometry analysis (Un-Scan-It; Silk Scientific Corp.). Each band was normalized to the total RAFTK level in the respective sample. In Vitro Pull-down Assay—The fast protein liquid chromatography affinity chromatography column was prepared with mouse anti-FLAG® M2 antibody-attached agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of FLAG-tagged WT RAFTK and 2 μg of GFP-tagged WT RAFTK, followed by preparation of whole cell lysates with modified RIPA lysis buffer. 4 ml of the cell lysates (1 mg/ml) were loaded on anti-FLAG affinity column beads. After extensive washing with Tris-buffered saline buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), each 1-ml fraction of elutes was collected after loading 5 ml of FLAG® peptide (100 mg/ml in Tris-buffered saline buffer; Sigma) for competitive elution according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). The collected fraction samples were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Autophosphorylation of RAFTK Requires Both Intact RAFTK Kinase Activity and the Tyrosine Residue at 402—RAFTK, a FAK subfamily member, is an intracellular tyrosine kinase that mediates tyrosine phosphorylation in various signaling pathways (6Avraham H. Park S. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Upon extracellular stimulation, such as by cell adhesion, intracellular Ca2+ increase, or growth factors, RAFTK undergoes autophosphorylation followed by subsequent molecular interaction and the activation of downstream signaling cascades. To analyze the molecular mechanism of RAFTK autophosphorylation, various deletion and point mutations of RAFTK were constructed (Fig. 1A). HEK 293 cells have no endogenous expression of RAFTK. These cells were transfected with the RAFTK constructs and analyzed for the tyrosine phosphorylation status of RAFTK by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and autophosphorylation at Tyr402 by immunoblotting with phospho-specific anti-Tyr(P)402-RAFTK antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, although wild type RAFTK (WT-FLAG and WT-GFP) was highly phosphorylated, a kinase mutant of RAFTK (KM-GFP) and RAFTK with a point mutation (tyrosine to phenylalanine) of the autophosphorylation site at 402 (Y402F-FLAG) were not phosphorylated. The pan RAFTK tyrosine phosphorylation was correlated with the RAFTK Tyr402 phosphotyrosine. This demonstrates that intact kinase activity and the tyrosine residue 402 were essential for RAFTK autophosphorylation. These data were further supported by the expression of an N terminus deletion mutant (del N-FLAG), which showed no phosphorylation because of the lack of the Tyr402 site, although it contained an intact kinase domain. Interestingly, autophosphorylation was detected in a C terminus deletion mutant (del C-FLAG) that contained the kinase domain and the autophosphorylation site at Tyr402, suggesting that the C terminus region was not essential for RAFTK autophosphorylation at residue 402. RAFTK Autophosphorylation Was Mediated by a Trans-acting Mechanism Not by a Cis-acting Mechanism—Autophosphorylation of a kinase can be accomplished by two different mechanisms. One is intramolecular cis-autophosphorylation and the other is intermolecular trans-autophosphorylation. We hypothesized that if autophosphorylation can be mediated by a transacting mechanism, the interaction between RAFTK kinase activity and the tyrosine residue at 402 present in different RAFTK molecules would mediate the autophosphorylation of RAFTK. However, if the autophosphorylation is mediated by a cis-acting mechanism, the two components, RAFTK kinase activity and the tyrosine residue at 402, should be present in a single RAFTK molecule. To investigate this hypothesis, we utilized co-expression of two RAFTK constructs differentially fused with either FLAG epitope (an eight-amino acid peptide, DYKDDDDK) or GFP. As shown in Fig. 2A, a GFP-tagged kinase mutant RAFTK (KM-GFP) was phosphorylated at Tyr402 by co-expressed FLAG-tagged wild type RAFTK (WT-FLAG), suggesting the existence of trans-acting autophosphorylation of RAFTK. Confirming the trans-autophosphorylation of RAFTK, co-expression of Y402F-FLAG with KM-GFP showed that intact kinase domain-containing Y402F-FLAG phosphorylated KM-GFP (Fig. 2A), although neither of the constructs could be autophosphorylated alone (Fig. 1B). Based on the tyrosine phosphorylation level of KM-GFP, the trans-autophosphorylation activity of WT-FLAG was much greater than that of Y402F-FLAG (Fig. 2A). Next, we examined whether trans-autophosphorylation is the only autophosphorylation mechanism or whether cis-autophosphorylation also plays a role in RAFTK autophosphorylation. We reasoned that if the autophosphorylation of RAFTK was mediated by a trans-acting mechanism, overexpression of KM-GFP would inhibit the autophosphorylation of WT-FLAG through competition. Therefore, the level of WT-FLAG autophosphorylation could be determined by the relative amounts of the kinase-inactive molecule (KM-GFP) upon their co-expression. However, if the autophosphorylation occurs in a single molecule through a cis-acting mechanism, the autophosphorylation of WT-FLAG would be preserved at a certain level of phosphorylation regardless of KM-GFP co-expression. To this end, we co-transfected WT-FLAG and KM-GFP in various doses to examine the potential competition between the two constructs. As shown in Fig. 2B, KM-GFP inhibited the autophosphorylation of WT-FLAG at Tyr402 in a dose-dependent manner, and overexpression of KM-GFP almost completely abolished the autophosphorylation of WT-FLAG, indicating that RAFTK autophosphorylation is a trans-acting event not a cis-acting event. As a control, we examined the effect of the del N-FLAG RAFTK construct on WT-FLAG autophosphorylation upon their co-expression. As shown in Fig. 2C, del N-FLAG did not inhibit the autophosphorylation of WT-FLAG at Tyr402, indicating that inhibition of WT-FLAG autophosphorylation was a specific process dependent on the kinase-defective KM-GFP. To confirm that the inhibition of RAFTK wild type autophosphorylation by the RAFTK kinase mutant was through a trans-acting interaction and not through inhibition of RAFTK subcellular localization by the focal adhesion targeting domain at its C terminus, we examined the effects of KM-GFP on the autophosphorylation of del C-FLAG that lacks a C terminus region (Fig. 1A). In support of the trans-acting interaction of RAFTK, KM-GFP inhibited the autophosphorylation of del C-FLAG at 402 (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the KM-mediated inhibition of autophosphorylation is not dependent on the C terminus, which controls the subcellular localization of RAFTK to focal adhesion sites. Although we as well as other groups have reported that the RAFTK kinase mutant worked as a dominant negative (2Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B.

The intermolecular trans-phosphorylation of RAFTK provides a molecular basis for the observation that the RAFTK kinase mutant dominant-negatively inhibits wild type RAFTK autophosphorylation. Overexpression of exogenous RAFTK might produce clustering of the protein independent of subcellular localization. It may also explain why overexpression of RAFTK by transient transfection or viral infection leads to a high level of RAFTK phosphorylation. However, under physiological conditions, extracellular stimuli may provide a signal that results in the clustering of RAFTK and trans-autophosphorylation. For example, potassium depolarization of neuroendocrine PC12 cells induced a distinct redistribution of RAFTK at point contacts, which serve as activation centers for the recruitment of various signaling molecules, such as Src, paxillin, and Grb2. 2S.-Y.

Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). The interaction between exogenous GFP-tagged kinase-mutated RAFTK (KM-GFP) and endogenous RAFTK was monitored by examining autophosphorylation of KM-GFP upon potassium depolarization. As shown in Fig. 3A, immunoblotting with 4G10 and anti-Tyr(P)402-RAFTK antibodies revealed that autophosphorylation of KM-GFP was induced in the presence of endogenous RAFTK upon KCl stimulation. GFP-tagged wild type RAFTK (WT-GFP) showed constitutively autophosphorylated RAFTK (Fig. 3A). Although endogenous RAFTK showed induction of phosphorylation upon KCl stimulation in PC12 cells transfected with either vector-GFP (V-GFP) or KM-GFP, endogenous RAFTK showed induction of phosphorylation in cells transfected with WT-GFP in the absence of KCl stimulation (Fig. 3A). These results demonstrate that trans-acting autophosphorylation of RAFTK also occurs between exogenous and endogenous RAFTK. As a control, we expressed GFP-tagged WT or KM RAFTK in 293 cells that have no endogenous RAFTK expression. We found that exogenous GFP-tagged kinase-mutated RAFTK (KM-GFP) did not induce any autophosphorylation either in the presence or absence of KCl stimuli in the RAFTK-deficient HEK 293 cells (Fig. 3B), whereas the GFP-tagged wild type RAFTK (WT-GFP) showed constitutive autophosphorylation (Fig. 3B). These data support the notion that the autophosphorylation of kinase-mutated RAFTK requires endogenous RAFTK activity. Association between Differentially Tagged RAFTKs—Next, to further characterize the molecular interaction of RAFTK in trans-autophosphorylation, we investigated association between differentially tagged RAFTKs. FLAG-tagged wild type RAFTK (WT-FLAG) and GFP-tagged wild type RAFTK (WT-GFP) were co-immunoprecipitated in a dose-dependent manner upon their co-expression (Fig. 4A). This suggests that physical association of two RAFTK molecules can be detected during trans-autophosphorylation. To confirm the association between the differentially tagged RAFTKs, we analyzed this association by an in vitro pull-down assay using affinity chromatography with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose. As shown in Fig. 4B, WT-GFP was specifically associated and eluted with WT-FLAG. This supports the co-immunoprecipitation result (Fig. 4A). The relative amount of co-associated WT-GFP with WT-FLAG was very small, suggesting that the self-association of RAFTK was weak and transient. Analysis of RAFTK Regions Mediating Self-association—To further investigate the self-association region(s) in RAFTK, we analyzed the association of WT-GFP with various deletion mutants using immunoprecipitation. Both the N- and C-terminal deletion mutants associated with wild type RAFTK (WT-GFP), albeit at a significantly decreased level as compared with the WT-FLAG and KM-FLAG, indicating that the N- or C-terminal region was partially responsible for the association with WT-GFP (Fig. 5). Even deletion of the N terminus and Kinase domain (del NK) or of the kinase domain alone (del NC) showed some association. This suggests the possibility of multiple association regions. Because many receptor-type tyrosine kinases demonstrate a formation of stable dimers and trans-acting autophosphorylation (21Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3453) Google Scholar), we attempted to detect the formation of stable dimers using nondenatured native gel electrophoresis, a sucrose density gradient, and chemical coupling with various cross-linkers. However, we did not observe the formation of a stable complex using any of these approaches (data not shown). Although RAFTK induces trans-acting autophosphorylation as shown in receptor-type tyrosine kinases (21Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3453) Google Scholar), our data indicate that the trans-interaction of RAFTK does not form stable dimers. Thus, this suggests that RAFTK self-association is a transient event with more dynamic spatial and temporal responses. The Trans-autophosphorylation of RAFTK Is a Src Kinase-independent Process—Autophosphorylated RAFTK induces the activation of Src kinase through the association of RAFTK phosphotyrosine at 402 and the Src-SH2 domain (8Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Activated Src, in turn, mediates the phosphorylation of RAFTK at several tyrosine residues in the kinase domain and the C terminus region of RAFTK, which leads to increased RAFTK kinase activity and the recruitment of signaling molecules, such as Grb2 (6Avraham H. Park S. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 8Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). To analyze whether Src also plays a role in RAFTK trans-autophosphorylation through either increased RAFTK kinase activity or direct phosphorylation of Tyr402, we utilized two cell lines: a murine embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking Src family kinases (SYF) and a c-Src-reintroduced cell line (SYF + Src). First, we examined the autophosphorylation of various RAFTK constructs upon single transfection. As shown in Fig. 6A (first panel with 4G10 antibody), in SYF cells only the WT-FLAG and del C-FLAG showed the tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas in SYF + Src cells the KM-GFP, Y402F-FLAG, and del N-FLAG as well as WT-FLAG and del C-FLAG showed significant tyrosine phosphorylation. However, Src did not affect the autophosphorylation level of RAFTK at Tyr402 (Fig. 6A, second panel with anti-Tyr(P)402-RAFTK-specific antibody), although Src significantly increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK. These data suggest that Src does not affect RAFTK autophosphorylation either directly or indirectly. To examine the expression of Src in these two cell lines, whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with Src antibody. Lack of Src expression was observed in the SYF cells, and positive expression of Src was found in the SYF + Src cells (Fig. 6A, fifth panel). Interestingly, immunoblotting with anti-phosphospecific Tyr(P)418-Src antibody against the active form of Src kinase demonstrated that Src is constitutively activated in the SYF + Src cells (Fig. 6A, sixth panel). Because c-Src-reintroduced SYF + Src cells were immortalized by simian virus 40 large T antigen from murine embryonic fibroblasts, SV40 large T antigen might activate c-Src and lead to the phosphorylation of RAFTK in the absence of interactions with Tyr402 of RAFTK. This possibility is consistent with another report investigating the interaction of v-Src with FAK, which showed that the FAK Tyr397 autophosphorylation site was not required for v-Src to stably interact with and phosphorylate FAK (22Roy S. Ruest P.J. Hanks S.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In comparison, because HEK 293 cells do not have constitutively activated Src, only autophosphorylated RAFTK can activate Src, which is followed by Src-mediated phosphorylation of the Tyr579/580 residues (Fig. 1B). It is important to note that in the SYF + Src cells, overexpression of Src induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of KM-GFP, Y402F-FLAG, and del N-FLAG other than at site Tyr402 (compare first and secondpanels of Fig. 6A showing pan phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody and Tyr(P)402 phosphospecific antibody). Next, we examined the trans-autophosphorylation of RAFTK upon co-transfection of KM-GFP with various RAFTK constructs. As shown in Fig. 6B (first panel with 4G10 antibody), in SYF cells the KM-GFP was phosphorylated at a low level by co-transfection of WT-FLAG, Y402F-FLAG, del C-FLAG, and del N-FLAG, whereas in SYF + Src cells the KM-GFP was significantly increased in phosphorylation by co-transfection of WT-FLAG, Y402F-FLAG, del C-FLAG, and del N-FLAG. However, Src did not significantly affect the trans-autophosphorylation of KM-GFP at Tyr402 (Fig. 6B, second panel with anti-Tyr(P)402-RAFTK-specific antibody), although Src did significantly increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of KM-GFP. These data suggest that Src does not affect RAFTK autophosphorylation either directly or indirectly. Trans-autophosphorylation of RAFTK Occurred Only at Tyr402—Although it is well established that RAFTK is autophosphorylated upon stimulation, it is unclear to date whether the autophosphorylation occurs only at Tyr402 or at other additional sites. Lakkakorpi et al. (14Lakkakorpi P.T. Bett A.J. Lipfert L. Rodan G.A. Duong L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11502-11512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) reported that RAFTK-Y402F showed autophosphorylation activities based on an in vitro kinase assay with immunoprecipitated RAFTK-Y402F, suggesting the existence of additional autophosphorylation sites in addition to Tyr402. However, this result cannot exclude the possibility that a co-immunoprecipitated kinase, such as Src, might mediate RAFTK phosphorylation at other sites. Moreover, there is no report yet showing the autophosphorylation of RAFTK other than at the Tyr402 site in vivo. Therefore, we investigated whether the trans-autophosphorylation of RAFTK occurs in vivo at tyrosine residues other than Tyr402 using co-transfection of Y402F-FLAG with various RAFTK constructs. To this end, we utilized Src family kinase-deficient SYF cells, as compared with SYF + Src cells, to block the possible Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK. As shown in Fig. 6C, upon co-transfection of the indicated constructs, none of the RAFTK constructs phosphorylated Y402F-FLAG in the Src family-deficient SYF cells, whereas RAFTK-Y402F was phosphorylated in the c-Src reintroduced SYF + Src cells, indicating that RAFTK trans-autophosphorylation occurs only at residue Tyr402. Thus, RAFTK tyrosine residue 402 is a unique trans-autophosphorylation site for RAFTK activation. Although Lakkakorpi et al. (14Lakkakorpi P.T. Bett A.J. Lipfert L. Rodan G.A. Duong L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11502-11512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) reported the phosphorylation of RAFTK-KM at Tyr402, Tyr579/580, and Tyr881 in primary osteoclast-like cells, suggesting the possible involvement of another tyrosine kinase(s), given our data showing that activated Src phosphorylated RAFTK independent of the Tyr402 site (Fig. 6B) and that endogenous RAFTK can phosphorylate RAFTK-KM in a trans-acting mode, the suggestion that another kinase(s) may phosphorylate RAFTK Tyr402 is not convincing. Role of Src in RAFTK-mediated Paxillin Phosphorylation—Because RAFTK can exhibit several different levels of phosphorylation status, it is of interest to examine which state is critical for the phosphorylation of substrates, such as paxillin. Paxillin is a focal adhesion molecule and is well known as an in vivo substrate of RAFTK. We investigated whether autophosphorylation of RAFTK would be sufficient to phosphorylate paxillin or whether Src-mediated RAFTK phosphorylation would be required. We examined RAFTK-mediated paxillin phosphorylation in SYF as compared with SYF + Src cell lines using co-expression of various RAFTK constructs with paxillin. As shown in Fig. 7, RAFTK-mediated paxillin phosphorylation was significantly enhanced in the SYF + Src cells. These data suggest that autophosphorylation of RAFTK is not required for paxillin phosphorylation and that Src plays an important role in RAFTK-mediated paxillin phosphorylation. KM-GFP showed some paxillin phosphorylation in the SYF + Src cells, which might be mediated by Src activity (Fig. 7). Interestingly, in both cell lines, paxillin was significantly phosphorylated by del C-FLAG that lacks the RAFTK C-terminal region including the paxillin-binding focal adhesion targeting domain (Fig. 7), suggesting an alternative pathway for RAFTK to phosphorylate paxillin. Although RAFTK autophosphorylation is an initial step in RAFTK activation leading to the recruitment and activation of Src, activated Src, in turn, plays an important role in RAFTK-mediated paxillin phosphorylation as shown in Fig. 7. This result suggests an interdependent loop-like activation mechanism involving RAFTK and Src. This concerted activation mechanism of RAFTK and Src may provide a crucial step for tight regulation upon physiological stimuli. Based on our study, the activation of RAFTK occurs in several steps: 1) upon its stimulation, RAFTK trans-phosphorylates the autophosphorylation site 402, which induces RAFTK activation; 2) the RAFTK phosphotyrosine 402 then recruits and activates Src kinase, which in turn phosphorylates the kinase domain of RAFTK and enhances its kinase activity; and 3) the enhanced RAFTK activity induces the activation of downstream signaling pathways. Our results may provide important clues for the pharmacological application of RAFTK. Because RAFTK activity and downstream signaling heavily depend on RAFTK autophosphorylation of 402 through Src recruitment, blocking the Tyr402 autophosphorylation of RAFTK can be a good therapeutic target to inhibit RAFTK function. We are grateful to Drs. Jerome E. Groopman and In-Woo Park for much appreciated advice, discussion, and support of this work. We also thank Janet Delahanty for editing the manuscript."

The plant cell wall forms a structurally heterogeneous physiological barrier that in many cases must be perturbated before colonization by a pathogen can take place. To do so, fungal and bacterial pathogens are armed with a deconstructing mixture of enzymes that depolymerize polysaccharides in the plant cell wall (1Walton J.D. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). At the same time, plants can secrete proteins that inhibit these degradative glycosidases, including polygalacturonase-inhibitor proteins (2Albersheim P. Anderson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1815-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), pectin lyase inhibitor proteins (3Bugbee W.M. Phytopathology. 1993; 83: 63-68Crossref Google Scholar), and two different classes of endoxylanase inhibitors (4Debyser W. Derdelinckx G. Delcour J.A. J. Am. Soc. Brew. Chem. 1997; 55: 153-156Google Scholar, 5Rouau X. Surget A. J. Cereal Sci. 1998; 28: 63-70Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Endo-1,4-β-d-xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8, further referred to as xylanases) are key enzymes in the degradation of xylan, next to cellulose the most abundant natural polysaccharide, and arabinoxylan, an important quality-determining nonstarch polysaccharide in cereals. Plant xylanases, a topic of recent work (6Wu S.S.H. Suen D.F. Chang H.C. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49055-49064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), are believed to have a regulatory function during processes of fertilization, seed germination, and programmed cell death. Microbial xylanases are increasingly better characterized because of their growing use in biotechnological processes to the benefit of processing and/or product quality parameters (e.g. bread making (7Courtin C.M. Roelants A. Delcour J.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1999; 47: 1870-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), pasta processing (8Ingelbrecht J.A. Moers K. Abécassis J. Rouau X. Delcour J.A. Cereal Chem. 2001; 78: 721-729Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), wheat gluten-starch separation (9Christophersen E.A. Jacobsen T.S. Wagner P. Starch Staerke. 1997; 49: 5-12Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and paper and pulp production (10Suurnäkki A. Tenkanen M. Buchert J. Viikari L. Adv. Biochem. Eng.

Based on amino acid sequence similarities, the data base of “carbohydrate-active enzymes” (12Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar) groups xylanases mainly into glycosyl hydrolase (GH) 1The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase; TAXI, Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor; ANXI, Aspergillus niger xylanase I; XIP, xylanase-inhibiting protein. families 10 and 11. GH family 10 xylanases possess a TIM-barrel (β/α)8 topology, with the two catalytic residues located at the C termini of strands β-4 and β-7 (13White A. Withers S.G. Gilkes N.R. Rose D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12546-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). GH family 11 xylanases have a β-jelly roll structure in which the substrate-binding groove is formed by the concave face of the inner β-sheet (14Campbell R. Rose D.R. Wakarchuk W. To R. Sung W. Yaguchi M. Suominen P. Reinikainen T. Proceedings of the Second TRICEL Symposium on Trichoderma reesei Cellulases and Other Hydrolases. Foundation for Biotechnical and Industrial Fermentation Research, Helsinki1993: 63-72Google Scholar). The only endogenous wheat xylanase characterized to date belongs to GH family 10. The two-step reaction mechanism for the hydrolysis of the β-1,4-linkages between d-xylosyl residues in arabinoxylan by these retaining GHs is well understood. However, there is a paucity of information on the mechanism underlying their inhibition by naturally occurring inhibitors. To date, two distinct types of xylanase inhibitors have been isolated from wheat, i.e. Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor (TAXI) (4Debyser W. Derdelinckx G. Delcour J.A. J. Am. Soc. Brew. Chem. 1997; 55: 153-156Google Scholar) and xylanase-inhibiting protein (XIP)-type endoxylanase inhibitors (5Rouau X. Surget A. J. Cereal Sci. 1998; 28: 63-70Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). At least two TAXI-type inhibitors, TAXI-I and TAXI-II, have been identified both with molecular masses of ∼40 kDa but differing from one another in pI (8.9 and 9.3, respectively) (15Gebruers K. Debyser W. Goesaert H. Proost P. Van Damme J. Delcour J.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Both TAXI-I- and TAXI-II-type inhibitors occur in two molecular forms, A and B. After reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, form B dissociates into a 10- and a 30-kDa fragment, whereas the molecular mass of form A (40 kDa) is not affected by this treatment. Because the N-terminal sequences of the 30- and 40-kDa polypeptides are identical, the 10- and 30-kDa polypeptides of form B, held together by one disulfide bond, are believed to be derived from form A by processing, possibly mediated by proteolytic enzymes (16Fierens K. Brijs K. Courtin C.M. Gebruers K. Goesaert H. Raedschelders G. Robben J. Van Campenhout S. Volckaert G. Delcour J.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Xylanase inhibitor protein-I (XIP-I) is a glycosylated monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 29 kDa and a pI value of 8.7–8.9. XIP-I possesses a (β/α)8 barrel fold and displays structural features typical of GH family 18 but lacks chitinase activity (17Payan F. Flatman R. Porciero S. Williamson G. Juge N. Roussel A. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). There is no sequence homology between TAXI- and XIP-type inhibitors. Moreover they have different xylanase specificities. Both TAXI-type inhibitors specifically inhibit bacterial and fungal GH family 11 xylanases, with Ki values ranging from 12.3 to 20.1 nm. Although TAXI-I inhibition activity seems to be independent of the pH optima of the xylanases, TAXI-II inhibition of GH family 11 enzymes with low pH optima is weak or absent (15Gebruers K. Debyser W. Goesaert H. Proost P. Van Damme J. Delcour J.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). XIP-I inhibits fungal xylanases from both GH families 10 and 11, with Ki values between 3.4 and 610 nm, with exception of the GH family 10 Aspergillus aculeatus xylanase but does not affect bacterial GH family 10 and 11 xylanases (18Flatman R. McLauchlan W.R. Juge N. Furniss C. Berrin J.-G. Hughes R. Manzanares P. Ladbury J.E. O'Brien R. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We describe here the x-ray structures of TAXI-I alone and TAXI-I in complex with Aspergillus niger xylanase I (ANXI). Despite very low sequence homology levels, TAXI-I is structurally homologous with the pepsin-like family of aspartic proteases. Reasons are put forward for a lack of proteolytic activity. The structure of the ANXI·TAXI-I complex reveals the molecular basis for the tight binding inhibition. The extensive interactions provide a deeper understanding for the differences in TAXI-I and TAXI-II-type inhibition specificities. TAXI protein homologues are discussed and indicate a physiological function of TAXIs as plant protective microbial GH inhibitors. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Phasing of TAXI-I—TAXI-I was purified from wheat (var. Soissons) flour as described previously (19Gebruers K. Goesaert H. Brijs K. Courtin C.M. Delcour J.A. J. Enzyme Inhib. Med. Chem. 2002; 17: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Crystals were obtained in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.6) containing 23% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 and 0.15 m ammonium sulfate, using the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method at room temperature. TAXI-I crystals belong to space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 50.26 Å, b = 66.72 Å, and c = 106.06 Å. A TAXI-I gold derivative was obtained when crystals were soaked in 1.5 mm KAuCl4 solution for 20 h. Glycerol at a concentration of 20% was used as cryoprotectant. Native and single wavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a MAR CCD detector using synchrotron radiation at the X11 and BW7A beam lines of the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany) to a resolution limit of 1.70 and 1.75 Å, respectively. All data were integrated and scaled with the HKL suite (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Statistics on the collected data are given in Table I. One Au atom position could be located by anomalous difference Patterson analysis. After confirmation and refinement of the Au atom site with autoSHARP (21Fortelle La de E. Bricogne G.

J. 2001; 353: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the 2Fo - Fc difference electron density map indicates an N-glycosylation for residue Asn105. Because of a low occupancy or high thermal motion, no defined spatial arrangement could be assigned and hence no glycan moiety was included in the model. Structure Determination of the ANXI·TAXI-I Complex—The xylanase·inhibitor complex was prepared as described previously (25Sansen S. De Ranter C.J. Gebruers K. Brijs K. Courtin C.M. Delcour J.A. Rabijns A. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor-diffusion geometry at 277 K with a reservoir solution containing 0.25 m magnesium acetate and 17% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 in a sodium cacodylate buffer (0.1 m, pH 6.5). Prior to x-ray exposure, crystals were cryoprotected as described above. A complete data set to a resolution of 1.8 Å could be collected with an ADSC Q4R CCD detector at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) on beam line ID14-EH1. Data were processed using MOSFLM (26Leslie A.G.W. Jnt. CCP4/ESF-EACMB Newslett. Protein Crystallogr. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and SCALA (24Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). The space group was assigned as P31 or P32, with unit cell parameters a = b = 88.43 Å and c = 128.99 Å. Further statistics are summarized in Table I. According to Matthews coefficient calculations (27Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 82: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the asymmetric unit consists of two inhibitor·enzyme complex molecules. In four consecutive molecular replacement protocols (CNS, Ref. 28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Glore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jaing J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) two TAXI-I and two xylanase molecules were independently positioned in the asymmetric unit by using the native TAXI-I structure and that of the native ANXI (PDB code 1ukr) (29Krengel U. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) as templates. The orientation of the molecules was found with data between 15 and 4.0 Å. The positioning of the oriented molecules resulted in the first model of the ANXI·TAXI-I complex when space group P32 was used. Initial rigid body refinement was followed by cycles of maximum likelihood refinement with REF-MAC (24Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) and manual rebuilding. Table I lists the refinement statistics. The final model exhibits good stereochemical parameters with all residues in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. As for the native TAXI-I structure, three surface loop regions of TAXI-I cannot be defined by electron density. Overall Structure of TAXI-I—The structure of TAXI-I (residues 1–381) is numbered starting from the first residue of the mature protein as determined by gene sequencing (17Payan F. Flatman R. Porciero S. Williamson G. Juge N. Roussel A. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). TAXI-I folds as a two β-barrel domain protein with a few helical segments, and the separate domains are divided by an extended cleft (Fig. 1A). A homology search with the program Dali (30Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar) reveals a close structural relationship with the pepsin-like family of aspartic proteases and identified the architecture of the Rhizomucor miehei protease as the most similar structure (Z-score = 27.6). The nomenclature of the secondary structure elements is illustrated in Fig. 1B. Loop regions will hereafter be referred to as LXxYy, with X and Y as the secondary structure elements, respectively, at the N and the C terminus of the connecting loop. The six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet B (Na, Nj, Ni, Cy, Cz, and Ck) between the N and C domain forms the backbone of the molecule with each domain contributing three strands. In the N domain three β-sheets (N1–N3) are found to be packed orthogonally in a three-layered sandwich. Although N2 and N3 are composed of three (Ne, Nf, and Ng) and four (Ng, Nf, Nb, and Nc) antiparallel β-strands, respectively, sheet N1 consists of seven (Na, Nb, Nc, Nh, Nd, Ng, and Nf) mixed β-strands. A fairly similar image is seen in the C domain, three (C1–C3) β-sheets of which, C1 (Cl, Co, Cx, Cp, and Cw) and C3 (Ct, Cs, Cm, and Cn), are orthogonally packed in a two-layered sandwich. C1 and C2 (Cq, Cr, Cv, and Cu) are formed out of anti-parallel β-strands, whereas C3 is composed of mixed β-strands. Three long loops LNdHa, LHaNe, and LNeNf, together forming the outer rim of the N domain, are stabilized by disulfide bridges between Cys50 and Cys71, Cys55 and Cys80, and Cys66 and Cys92. The antiparallel topology of these three strands, together with the positions of the half-cysteines constituting the three disulfide bridges, makes the portion Cys50-Cys92 of TAXI-I look like a knottin domain. The small structural knottin motif is characterized by a triple-stranded β-sheet to which three disulfide bonds between Cys1-Cys4, Cys2-Cys5, and Cys3-Cys6 (Cys1 being the first cysteine at the N-terminal end of the domain) in a “disulfide through disulfide knot” provide a rigid framework (31Rees D.C. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 475-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In TAXI-I, however, none of the disulfide bridges “thread” through the macrocycle formed by the two other disulfide bonds and their interconnecting backbone. Therefore, this small cysteine-rich TAXI-I domain can be classified as knottin-like. Loop LNdHa is further connected to the end of β-strand Ng by a fourth disulfide bridge between Cys39 and Cys124. The TAXI-I structure also presents a disulfide bond between the β-strands Cr and Cv (Cys282-Cys327) of the C domain and one interdomain disulfide connection between Cys167 and Cys378. This interdomain bond is not only of particular interest with regard to the defined molecular forms A and B of TAXI-type inhibitors, in addition to hydrophobic interactions between side-chain atoms, it also procures the major maintaining force for the position of the C-terminal loop LCzCterm. SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing circumstances on dissolved TAXI-I crystals indicates the presence in the crystal of both molecular forms A and B (data not shown). Hence, the absence of clearly defined electron density for residues His263, Ala264, Asn265, Gly266, Ala267, Pro268, and Val269 can be explained, because form B presumably results from a proteolytic cleavage of form A after Asn265 (16Fierens K. Brijs K. Courtin C.M. Gebruers K. Goesaert H. Raedschelders G. Robben J. Van Campenhout S. Volckaert G. Delcour J.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These residues are part of loop LHeCq, connecting the longest α-helix He present in the structure, with β-sheet C2, the outer rim of the C domain (Fig. 1). The loop LHeCq is believed to protrude deeply into the solvent and hence to be very flexible. This freedom of movement can be inspected in the crystal packing, for which the N domain makes many more surface contacts with symmetry-related molecules than the C domain. It is also reflected in the slightly higher individual B-factors of the residues adjacent to this region. In our opinion, the partial cleavage has no profound effect on the overall architecture of TAXI-I, and hence both molecular forms can coexist in TAXI-I crystals. Comparison with Pepsin Fold and Lack of Proteolytic Activity of TAXI-I—The structure of TAXI-I is highly similar to the core structure of R. miehei aspartic protease (PDB code 2rmp) (32Yang J. Quail J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with a root mean square deviation of 1.78 Å for 241 pairs of Cα atoms while sharing only 15.3% of sequence identity over the equivalenced positions. Differences between the structures are confined primarily to the loop regions. Similar statistics for secondary structure matching were found for other proteins of the pepsin-like family with an aspartic protease fold. According to the program Dali (30Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), fungal endothiapepsin, yeast and fungal acid protease, human and mouse renin, and plant phytepsin folds all display an equal strength in structural similarity and an equally low degree of sequence identity (maximum 16%). A structure-based sequence alignment of aspartic proteases deposited in the PDB reveals 23 strictly conserved residues. Each of them occupies a similar spatial position in all proteins, believed to serve as conformational determinants specifying the uniqueness of the fold. Therefore, it is striking that in TAXI-I only seven of them are conserved. Tyr16 and Trp36, in β-strand Nb and Nd, are involved in mediating two separate loops through hydrogen bonds. Tyr16 Oη is hydrogen-bonded (2.6 Å) to Oϵ1 of Glu354 on loop LHhCy in central sheet B. Trp36 fills a large void in the N domain, with Nϵ stabilizing the main-chain Tyr85 oxygen in loop LNeNf. Gly142, Gly180, and Gly349 are invariably located at a turn and ascertain the peculiarities of this fold. Lastly, Asp29 and Thr236 are part of the two catalytic triads known to constitute the active site of aspartic proteases. With only a few exceptions, aspartic-type peptidases attack the scissile peptide bond by a nucleophilic water molecule activated by two Asp residues, located in two Asp-Thr-Gly motifs at the active site. With respect to the standard numbering system for mature pepsin, residues Asp32, Thr33, Gly34, Asp215, Thr216, and Gly217 are shown to be Asp29, Val30, Ala31, Ser235, Thr236, and Arg237 for the equivalent positions in TAXI-I (Fig. 2A). The replacement of Asp by Ser in position 235, together with a subtle change in the placement of the nucleophilic solvent molecule, normally situated medially between the two active-site Asp residues, might be expected to thwart the nucleophilic capability of the water molecule and hence render TAXI-I proteolytically inactive. A similar observation is seen in a model of the structure of bovine pregnancy-associated glycoproteins, a class of proteins structurally related to pepsin and for the greater part proteolytically inactive (33Xie S. Green J. Bixby J.B. Szafranska B. DeMartini J.C. Hecht S. Roberts M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12809-12816Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, the position of the Arg237 side chain, strongly hydrogen bonded to Asp29 through Nϵ to Oδ1 (2.86 Å) and Nζ2 to Oδ2 (2.77 Å), is such that the P1-P1′-binding position of a possible substrate is occupied. This completely covers the “active-site area” and hence prevents accession by a possible substrate (Fig. 2A). Finally, another significant difference between pepsin-like aspartic proteases and TAXI-I is the position of the so-called “flap region” (34Bialey D. Cooper J.B. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2129-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a β-hairpin loop crucial for the substrate-specificity. A determining factor for the positioning of this region in pepsin is the orientation of Tyr74, which is juxtaposed with Trp39 and defined by an Oη–Nϵ distance of 3.1 Å. In TAXI-I, this whole region is tilted inwards, driven by the aforementioned hydrogen bond between Trp36 Nϵ and the main-chain Tyr85 oxygen, resulting in a closure of the “substrate-binding area” (Fig. 2B). Interaction Interface—The structure of the ANXI·TAXI-I complex reveals extensive interactions, resulting in the burial of 992 Å2 of accessible surface area. Five TAXI-I loop regions (LNiNj, LHdCk, LHfCs, LHhCy, and LCzCterm) completely cover the deep substrate-binding and active site cleft of the xylanase through ionic, hydrogen-bonding, hydrophobic, and water-bridged contacts (Fig. 3A). Upon binding, no major conformational changes take place in the TAXI-I structure. In the xylanase, the “thumb” region is displaced (in accordance with the description by Törrönen et al. (35Törrönen A. Harkki A. Rouvinen J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2493-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) based on the resemblance of the overall structure to a right-hand shape) with respect to the uncomplexed ANXI structure (PDB code 1ukr) (29Krengel U. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This region, a β-hairpin loop encompassing residues 110–130, points back toward the bottom of the cleft (or “hand palm”) with the shortest spanning distance of 4.3 Å (Pro119 Cβ to Tyr10 Oη). Upon intercalation of the loop LCzCterm of TAXI-I, this distance is lengthened to 7.35 Å. Changes in this region have previously been observed when comparing native xylanase and substrate-liganded xylanase structures. They are driven by changes in torsion angles mainly concentrated in the area at the base of the thumb. In the ANXI·TAXI-I complex, this movement originates from side-chain rotations at the “tip of the thumb.” The side-chain χ3-torsion angle of Arg115 is flipped by 168°, compared with the uncomplexed structure, forming three hydrogen bonds with TAXI-I main-chain oxygen atoms in loop LCzCterm. In Glu118, a rearrangement of 94° in the χ2-torsion angle results in two hydrogen bridges with Oδ2 of Asp355 on the LHhCy loop of TAXI-I. Structural Basis for the Inhibition of Xylanase—The active site of GH family 11 xylanases contains two conserved Glu residues located on either side of the extended open cleft. Hydrolysis of xylosidic substrates proceeds via a double displacement mechanism in which the nucleophilic catalyst Glu79 forms a covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate, which is subsequently hydrolyzed by the acid/base catalyst Glu170 (numbers as described previously (29Krengel U. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar)). To this end, both Glu residues are part of an extended hydrogen bond network, which is capable of fine tuning their respective catalytical properties and of which the constituting residues function as substrate-binding and positioning subsites. These sites, that bind the glycon or aglycone regions of the substrate, are prefixed by - and +, respectively, and the number that identifies each subsite is related to the proximity to the site of bond cleavage, which takes place between subsites -1 and +1 (29Krengel U. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the ANXI·TAXI-I structure, the His374 imidazole ring of TAXI-I is located in between the two catalytic Glu residues of ANXI (Fig. 3B). The Nϵ2 atom virtually takes the place of the xylose C-1 atom in subsite -1 during hydrolysis and is highly stabilized through ionic interaction with Glu79 Oϵ2 (distance 2.63 Å). Furthermore, the Nδ2 atom is hydrogen"

https://openalex.org/W2032878080,"The BRCA1 tumor suppressor and the BARD1 protein form a stable heterodimeric complex that can catalyze the formation of polyubiquitin chains. Expression of BRCA1 fluctuates in a cell cycle-dependent manner, such that low steady-state levels of BRCA1 gene products are found in resting cells and early G1 cycling cells and high levels in S and G2 phase cells. Although transcriptional activation of the BRCA1 gene can account for induction of BRCA1 expression at the G1/S transition, the mechanisms by which BRCA1 is down-regulated during cell cycle progression have not been addressed. Here we show that the steady-state levels of BRCA1 protein remain elevated throughout mitosis but begin to decline at the M/G1 transition.

Formation of these conjugates occurs throughout G1 and S, but not in cells arrested in prometaphase by nocodazole. The proteasome-sensitive ubiquitin conjugates of BRCA1 appear to be distinct from BRCA1 autoubiquitination products and are probably catalyzed by the action of other cellular E3 ligases. Interestingly, co-expression of BARD1 inhibits the formation of these conjugates, suggesting that BARD1 serves to stabilize BRCA1 expression in part by reducing proteasome-sensitive ubiquitination of BRCA1 polypeptides.

Germline mutations of the BRCA1 gene are responsible for a substantial proportion of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers (1Wooster R. Weber B.L. N. Engl. J.

In this clinical setting, BRCA1 serves as a tumor suppressor that contributes to tumorigenesis through loss of function. The protein it encodes has been implicated in a number of biological processes, including the cellular response to DNA damage (3Jasin M.

As a key regulator of the DNA damage response, BRCA1 presumably promotes tumor suppression by preserving genomic stability. However, the molecular mechanisms by which it carries out these functions are not understood and, as a consequence, it is still unclear why inherited mutations of the BRCA1 gene predispose women to breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 polypeptide contains two recognizable amino acid motifs: a RING domain near the N terminus and two tandem copies of the BRCT domain at the C terminus (14Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennett L.M. Ding W. Bell R. Rosenthal J. Hussey C. Tran T. McClure M. Frye C. Hattier T. Phelps R. Haugen-Strano A.

In vivo, BRCA1 exists as a heterodimer with BARD1, a distinct protein that harbors a similar array of RING and BRCT motifs (15Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Since the phenotypes of mice null for either Brca1 or Bard1 are essentially indistinguishable, the functions of both proteins are likely to be mediated through the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer (16McCarthy E.E. Celebi J.T. Baer R. Ludwig T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5056-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and indeed BARD1 has already been implicated with BRCA1 in homology-directed repair of chromosomal breaks (17Westermark U.K. Reyngold M. Olshen A.B. Baer R. Jasin M. Moynahan M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7926-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). BRCA1 and BARD1 associate by assembling a stable 4-helix bundle from the α helices that flank their respective RING domains (18Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.-C. Klevit R.E.

This enzymatic activity implies that BRCA1/BARD1 functions as an E3 ligase that promotes ubiquitin modification of specific substrate proteins, and that these are likely to include important effectors of BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression (25Baer R. Ludwig T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 26Ohta T. Fukuda M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2079-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although definitive substrates of BRCA1/BARD1 have not yet been identified, autoubiquitination of the BRCA1 subunit is observed during in vitro reactions catalyzed by BRCA1/BARD1 (22Chen A.

In vitro, BRCA1/BARD1 directs the formation of ubiquitin polymers through an unconventional isopeptide linkage involving lysine residue K6 of ubiquitin (27Wu-Baer F. Lagrazon K. Yuan W. Baer R. J.

However, the functional consequences of BRCA1 autoubiquitination and the cellular role of K6-linked polyubiquitin chains are still unclear. Early studies established that BRCA1 expression fluctuates in a cell cycle-dependent manner. While the steady-state levels of BRCA1 polypeptides are low in resting (G0) cells and G1 cycling cells, these levels increase considerably as cycling cells enter S phase (31Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ruffner H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The induction of BRCA1 protein expression that occurs near the G1/S boundary is probably driven by transcriptional activation, since it is preceded by a sharp increase in the levels of BRCA1 mRNA that begins in late G1 (33Gudas J.M. Li T. Nguyen H. Jensen D. Rauscher III, F.J. Cowen K.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 717-723PubMed Google Scholar, 34Vaughn J.P. Davis P.L. Jarboe M.D. Huper G. Evans A.C. Wiseman R.W. Futreal P.A. Marks J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 711-715PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the promoter region of BRCA1 harbors binding sites for E2F transcription factors that may be responsible for the cell cycle-dependent induction of BRCA1 transcription (35Wang A. Schneider-Broussard R. Kumar A.P. MacLeod M.C. Johnson D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4532-4536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which BRCA1 levels are down-regulated as cells progress from S phase to the next G1 phase have not been examined. Here we show that, after peaking in late G1, the steady-state levels of BRCA1 mRNA steadily decline as cycling cells divide and enter the subsequent G1 phase. In addition, we find that BRCA1 polypeptides are subject to ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation at specific stages of cell cycle progression and that dimerization with BARD1 serves to protect BRCA1 polypeptides from ubiquitination in vivo. These data indicate that the cell cycle regulation of BRCA1 expression is determined in part by active degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Cell Culture—The T24, HeLa, and 293 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection and maintained in McCoy's 5A, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Iscove's media, respectively, supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The following drugs were obtained from Calbiochem and used at the noted concentrations unless otherwise specified: cycloheximide (100 μg/ml), MG132 (20 μm), ALLN (100 μm), ALLM (100 μm), and lactacystin (25 μm). Cells were treated with drugs at ∼50% confluence. Western Analysis and Antibodies—Samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE by adding 5× protein loading dye (0.313 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 25% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and denaturing at 70 °C for 10 min. For Western analysis of BRCA1, 20-μg aliquots of total cell lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE on 3–8% Tris-acetate gels (Invitrogen) run at 135 V for 2 h. For analysis of PTTG, samples were separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) in MES 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. buffer, while analyses of other proteins were performed using 8% Tris-glycine gels. The BARD1-specific polyclonal antiserum (15Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat.

A. 1997; 94: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have been described. Other antibodies used include BRCA1 (Santa Cruz C-20), cyclin A (Oncogene Ab-3), cyclin B1 (BD Pharmingen), PTTG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), α-tubulin (Oncogene Ab-1), Plk1 (Santa Cruz H-152), and ubiquitin (Santa Cruz P4D1). Cell Cycle Analysis—T24 cells were arrested in G0 by contact inhibition as described (36Jin Y. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Wei F. Ayi T.-C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were synchronized in prometaphase by a thymidine/nocodazole block that entailed a 12 h treatment with 2 mm thymidine followed by a 14–18 h treatment with 50 ng/ml nocodazole; the mitotic cells were then harvested by shake-off, and released into nocodazole-free medium after washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Both the attached and unattached cells were harvested at each time point and used for FACS, Western, and Northern analyses. For FACS, the cells were stained with propidium iodide as described (36Jin Y. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Wei F. Ayi T.-C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur using CellQuest software. For Western analysis, the cells were lysed in low salt Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, BMB protease inhibitor pellet), and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm NaVO4) and analyzed as described above. For Northern analysis, cytoplasmic RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and 20-μg aliquots were evaluated by Northern filter hybridization with radiolabeled cDNA probes for BRCA1, BARD1, and β-actin using ExpressHyb solution (Clontech). Identification of Ubiquitinated Conjugates of Exogenous BRCA1 in Vivo—The FLAG-BRCA1 expression plasmid (Fl4-BRCA1-wt/pCMV) encodes full-length human BRCA1 with an N-terminal extension of 39 residues that contains four tandem FLAG epitopes; this plasmid was generated by inserting a cDNA sequence for single FLAG-tagged BRCA1 into the pCMV-Fl3-Not vector (derived from the 3×FLAG-CMV-7 plasmid; Sigma). The Fl4-BR771/pCMV expression vector encodes a truncated BRCA1 fragment (ΔBRCA1; amino acids 1–771) with the same N-terminal extension containing four tandem FLAG epitopes; it was prepared by inserting a cDNA sequence for single FLAG-tagged ΔBRCA1 into the pCMV-Fl3-Not vector. The C61G and I26A mutants of BRCA1 were generated using the Stratagene Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit. The mammalian expression plasmids pMT107 and pMT123 were a gift from Dr. Dirk Bohmann; these encode polyproteins comprised of 8 tandem copies of the His6-tagged or HA-tagged ubiquitin, respectively (37Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). To examine in vivo ubiquitination of exogenous BRCA1 polypeptides, 2 × 106 293 cells were seeded onto a 100-mm plate. After 12 h the cells were transfected using 25–30 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) with 10–12 μg of total plasmid DNA encoding FLAG-BRCA1, BARD1, and/or His6-Ub, all under the control of a CMV promoter. At 30 h after transfection, the cells were treated with MG132 or the specified drug for an additional 6 h. The cells (∼2 × 107 cells at ∼70% confluence) were then lysed by a brief sonication in 700 μl of FLAG lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% Sarkosyl, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, BMB protease inhibitor pellet), phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4), and deubiquitinase inhibitors (5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 10 nm ubiquitin aldehyde). Immunoprecipitations were performed by rotating 630 μl of cell lysate with 50 μl of anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma, 20% slurry) at 4 °C for 10–12 h. The beads were washed four times with FLAG lysis buffer and eluted for 12 h at 4 °C with 500 μg/ml FLAG peptide in 40 μl of FLAG lysis buffer. Samples were separated on 3–8% Tris-acetate gels (Invitrogen), and Western analyses were performed with antibodies that recognize BRCA1 (Oncogene Ab-1), BARD1 (polyclonal 669D), and ubiquitin (Santa Cruz P4D1). Purification of Endogenous Ubiquitinated Proteins—To generate a cell line that stably expresses His6-tagged ubiquitin, HeLa cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with a mammalian expression plasmid (His-Ub8/pCIN4) that encodes a polyprotein comprised of 8 tandem copies of His6-Ub; this plasmid was generated by excising the polyprotein cDNA sequence from pMT107 (37Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) and inserting it into the pCIN4 vector (pIRES-neo; Clontech). HeLa cell transformants were selected with 0.5 mg/ml G418, and maintained in 0.25 mg/ml G418. The thymidine/nocodazole block and release were performed as described above, with only unattached cells collected at the mitotic time points and only attached cells at the interphase time points. Double thymidine blocks were performed by seeding 2 × 106 cells onto each 100-mm plate, culturing the cells in 2 mm thymidine for 14 h, releasing the cells in thymidine-free medium for 10 h, treating for another 14 h with 2 mm thymidine, and releasing in thymidine-free medium containing 50 ng/ml nocodazole. MG132 addition and cell collection were performed at the time points described (six 100-mm plates at each time point for nocodazole release, four 100-mm plates for double thymidine release). Approximately 1 × 106 cells from each time point were used for FACS analysis, and the remaining cells were lysed in 10 ml of lysis buffer (6 m guanidinium HCl, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0) and sonicated for 2 min on ice. To analyze the lysates directly by Western blotting, trichloroacetic acid precipitation was performed by diluting 10 μl of lysate into 500 μl of water containing 80 μg/ml sodium deoxycholate as a carrier. After adding 71 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid, the sample was incubated on ice for 1 h and then microcentrifuged for 15 min. The pellet was washed twice with cold acetone, dried, resuspended in 1× protein dye, and denatured for Western analysis. To isolate ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, the remainder of the cell lysate was incubated with 50 μl of Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) for 2 h. The beads were then washed eight times for 5 min each with 4 ml of buffer containing 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol supplemented with the following: 1) 6 m guanidinium HCl, pH 8.0; 2) 8 m urea, pH 8.0; 3) 8 m urea, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 6.3; 4) 8 m urea, pH 6.3; 5) 8 m urea, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 6.3; 6) 8 m urea, pH 6.3; 7) 8 m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 6.3; or 8) 8 m urea, pH 6.3. The ubiquitin conjugates were then eluted with 50 μl NTA elution buffer (0.15 m Tris-HCl pH 6.7, 200 mm imidazole, 5% SDS, 0.72 m β-mercaptoethanol, 30% glycerol). After adding 5× protein loading dye and denaturing at 70 °C for 10 min, the eluates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. RNAi Transfections—The siRNAs specific for human BACH1 (AGCUUACCCGUCACAGCUUdTdT) (38Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) and human BARD1 (AACAGUAACAUGUCCGAUGAAdTdT) were synthesized by Dharmacon RNA Technologies (Lafayette, CO). In addition, a SMARTpool of four siRNAs specific for BARD1 was also obtained from Dharmacon. HeLa cells were grown in 6-well plates in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without antibiotics. At 30% confluence, the cells were transfected with 80 pmol of siRNA and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 6 h, the transfection mixtures were replaced with complete medium. After culturing the cells for an additional 18 h, the transfection procedure was repeated, and the cells were harvested for analysis 48 h after the initial transfection. Cell Cycle Regulation of BRCA1 and BARD1—To confirm the cell cycle regulation of BRCA1 and BARD1 expression, T24 bladder carcinoma cells were arrested in G0 by contact inhibition, released into fresh medium, and collected at various time points. In accord with previous studies (31Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ruffner H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), BRCA1 polypeptides are undetectable in arrested T24 cells but begin to appear by 16-h post-induction as cells approach the G1/S transition (Fig. 1A). The levels of BRCA1 increase further during S and G2/M, before decreasing as the cells enter the next G1 phase by 36 h after induction. BRCA1 exists predominantly in a hypophosphorylated state in G1, but becomes hyperphosphorylated in S and G2/M, and reverts to a hypophosphorylated form again in the next G1 phase (31Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ruffner H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 39Thomas J.E. Smith M. Tonkinson J.L. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 801-809PubMed Google Scholar, 40Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). As reported previously (33Gudas J.M. Li T. Nguyen H. Jensen D. Rauscher III, F.J. Cowen K.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 717-723PubMed Google Scholar, 34Vaughn J.P. Davis P.L. Jarboe M.D. Huper G. Evans A.C. Wiseman R.W. Futreal P.A. Marks J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 711-715PubMed Google Scholar), expression of BRCA1 mRNA is maximal in late G1 and decreases as the cells traverse the cell cycle and enter the next G1 phase (Fig. 1B). Using a BARD1-specific polyclonal antibody, we find that BARD1 protein expression is also regulated with respect to the cell cycle (Fig. 1A). Protein levels follow a similar pattern as for BRCA1, appearing in late G1, increasing during S and G2/M, and decreasing as the cells enter the next G1 phase. The cell cycle-dependent nature of BARD1 protein expression differs from that described previously using a monoclonal antibody raised against BARD1 (36Jin Y. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Wei F. Ayi T.-C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); this discrepancy arose because the monoclonal antibody cross-reacts with a nonspecific band that co-migrates with BARD1 (see Supplementary Data and Discussion). The mRNA expression of BARD1 follows the same pattern as that of BRCA1, peaking in late G1 and decreasing during the remainder of the cell cycle (Fig. 1B). Thus, BRCA1 and BARD1 expression are co-induced at both the mRNA and protein level as cells progress from G1 to S phase. To determine the timing and kinetics of the decrease in BRCA1 and BARD1 protein levels from the G2/M to G1 phase, HeLa cells were arrested in prometaphase by a thymidine/nocodazole block, released into nocodazole-free medium, and collected at hourly time points. Upon release from mitotic arrest, we observed a steady decrease in the levels of BARD1 and especially BRCA1 (Fig. 2A). Although the steady-state levels of their mRNAs also decline after mitosis (Fig. 2B), this result suggests that BRCA1 and BARD1 polypeptides are actively degraded in vivo. Therefore, the kinetics of BRCA1 and BARD1 expression were compared with those of other proteins known to be proteolyzed during mitotic progression, including factors that begin to degrade in prometaphase (cyclin A), at the metaphase/anaphase transition (cyclin B1 and the securin PTTG), and at the M/G1 transition (Plk1) (41Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2A, the decline in BRCA1 and BARD1 levels starts later (2–3 h after nocodazole release) than that of cyclin B1 or PTTG (1–2 h after release), and continues into the next G1 phase. This pattern more closely resembles that of Plk1, a protein kinase that undergoes proteasome-mediated degradation beginning at the M/G1 transition (42Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 43Ferris D.K. Maloid S.C. Li C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). BRCA1 Degradation Is Mediated by the Proteasome—To test whether endogenous BRCA1 and BARD1 polypeptides are actively degraded, their steady-state levels in asynchronous 293 cells were monitored after treatment with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 3A, BRCA1 protein levels declined within a few hours and displayed a much shorter half-life than α-tubulin. This implies that proliferating 293 cells possess an active mechanism for BRCA1 degradation. BARD1 protein levels decrease only slightly after 8 h of cycloheximide treatment, with a longer half-life and slower rate of turnover than BRCA1. Thus, BRCA1 may be the more tightly regulated subunit of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer. To determine whether BRCA1 degradation is mediated by the proteasome, we tested whether the cycloheximide-induced decrease in endogenous BRCA1 levels can be prevented by various proteasome inhibitors. MG132, ALLN, and ALLM are peptide aldehydes that inhibit the proteasome, as well as other cellular proteases, including cathepsins and calpains, with varying degrees of efficacy (44Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar); while MG132 and ALLN appear to inhibit most of these proteases, ALLM is a relatively poor inhibitor of the proteasome. When 293 cells were treated for 8 h with cycloheximide and various concentrations of these inhibitors, the cycloheximide-induced decrease in BRCA1 levels was prevented by increasing concentrations of MG132 and ALLN, but not ALLM (Fig. 3B). The decrease was also prevented by lactacystin, a more specific inhibitor of the proteasome, implying that BRCA1 degradation after cycloheximide treatment is indeed mediated by the proteasome in 293 cells. BRCA1 Is Degraded by Ubiquitin-mediated Proteolysis—Since the effect of proteasome inhibitors on cellular BRCA1 levels may be direct or indirect, we sought to determine whether the BRCA1 protein can be ubiquitinated in vivo. Therefore, 293 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding His6-tagged ubiquitin (to increase the cellular pool of free ubiquitin) and FLAG-tagged BRCA1. After treatment with various proteasome inhibitors, the cells were lysed in the presence of deubiquitinase inhibitors (N-ethylmaleimide and ubiquitin aldehyde). The FLAG-BRCA1 polypeptides were then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 beads and eluted with FLAG peptide. In these experiments, the cell lysis and immunoprecipitations were conducted under st"
https://openalex.org/W2034339628,"MLN51 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that is overexpressed in breast cancer. The function of MLN51 in mammals remains elusive. Its fly homolog, named barentsz, as well as the proteins mago nashi and tsunagi have been shown to be required for proper oskar mRNA localization to the posterior pole of the oocyte. Magoh and Y14, the human homologs of mago nashi and tsunagi, are core components of the exon junction complex (EJC). The EJC is assembled on spliced mRNAs and plays important roles in post-splicing events including mRNA export, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and translation. In the present study, we show that human MLN51 is an RNA-binding protein present in ribonucleo-protein complexes. By co-immunoprecipitation assays, endogenous MLN51 protein is found to be associated with EJC components, including Magoh, Y14, and NFX1/TAP, and subcellular localization studies indicate that MLN51 transiently co-localizes with Magoh in nuclear speckles. Moreover, we demonstrate that MLN51 specifically associates with spliced mRNAs in co-precipitation experiments, both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, at the position where the EJC is deposited. Most interesting, we have identified a region within MLN51 sufficient to bind RNA, to interact with Magoh and spliced mRNA, and to address the protein to nuclear speckles. This conserved region of MLN51 was therefore named SELOR for speckle localizer and RNA binding module. Altogether our data demonstrate that MLN51 associates with EJC in the nucleus and remains stably associated with mRNA in the cytoplasm, suggesting that its overexpression might alter mRNA metabolism in cancer.

MLN51 presents a correlated pattern of gene amplification and transcript overexpression in breast cancers and cancer-derived cell lines (1Tomasetto C. Regnier C. Moog-Lutz C. Mattei M.G. Chenard M.P.

In addition, elevated quantities of MLN51 protein have been found in 30% of primary breast tumor samples tested, although no correlation between MLN51 overexpression and a specific histological tumor type or grade has been found (4Degot S. Regnier C.H. Wendling C. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Tomasetto C. Oncogene. 2002; 21 (and references therein): 4422-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). MLN51 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein containing, within its amino-terminal half, a coiled-coil domain followed by two nuclear localization signals responsible for its nuclear localization. Its carboxyl-terminal half contains putative Src homology domains 2 and 3 binding sites and mediates its cytoplasmic retention (4Degot S. Regnier C.H. Wendling C. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Tomasetto C. Oncogene. 2002; 21 (and references therein): 4422-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Finally, MLN51 is well conserved during evolution in mammals as well as in more distant species such as worm and fly. From these results, we proposed previously (4Degot S. Regnier C.H. Wendling C. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Tomasetto C. Oncogene. 2002; 21 (and references therein): 4422-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that MLN51 might have a basal cellular function and that its overexpression in cancer cells may have deleterious effects. The MLN51 counterpart in the fly, called Barentsz, has been isolated from a functional genetic screening, as a gene essential for oskar mRNA localization (5van Eeden F.J. Palacios I.M. Petronczki M. Weston M.J. St. Johnston D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Messenger RNA localization to discrete cellular regions is an important process well described during oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. For instance, localization of bicoid and oskar mRNAs to the anterior and posterior poles of the oocyte, respectively, defines the anteriorposterior axis of the embryo (6St. Johnston D. Cell. 1995; 81: 161-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Both mRNAs are synthesized in nurse cells and then routed to the oocyte at opposite poles where they remain (7Driever W. Nusslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1988; 54: 95-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 8Ephrussi A. Lehmann R. Nature. 1992; 358: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Bicoid mRNA translation occurs at the anterior pole only after egg fertilization, whereas oskar mRNA translation is coupled to its localization at the posterior pole and starts at mid-oogenesis. The mechanisms that underlie oskar mRNA localization have been elucidated in part by the identification of mutants bearing oskar mRNA localization defects in D. melanogaster (9van Eeden F. St. Johnston D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To date, many mutants, including those with defects in the kinesin heavy chain, staufen, mago nashi, tsunagi, cytoplasmic tropomyosin II and barentsz genes, have been identified (10Martin S.G. Leclerc V. Smith-Litiere K. St. Johnston D. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 4201-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The trans-acting factors involved in oskar mRNA localization complex have diverse functions and are conserved in mammals. Kinesin heavy chain and tropomyosin II are related to cytoskeletal filaments, whereas staufen, mago nashi, and tsunagi are RNA-binding proteins. Although the kinesin heavy chain and staufen mammalian orthologs have also been shown to be implicated in mRNA localization (11Severt W.L. Biber T.U. Wu X. Hecht N.B. DeLorenzo R.J. Jakoi E.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3691-3702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Roegiers F. Jan Y.N. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 220-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), a similar role for the mago nashi and tsunagi human orthologs (Magoh and Y14) is not known. In contrast, the function of Magoh and Y14 in mRNA metabolism is well described. The stable Magoh/Y14 heterodimer is a core component of the exon junction complex (EJC) (13Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 14Kataoka N. Yong J. Kim V.N. Velazquez F. Perkinson R.A. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Mol.

This complex contains at least six proteins as follows: Aly/REF, SRm160, RNPS1, UAP56, Y14, and Magoh (13Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 14Kataoka N. Yong J. Kim V.N. Velazquez F. Perkinson R.A. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Mol.

Nature. 2001; 413: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). As a consequence of splicing, EJC is assembled onto nascent mRNA in a sequence-independent manner at a defined position located 20–24 nucleotides upstream of the exon-exon junction (13Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). In addition, Y14 and Magoh remain stably associated with mRNA after export to the cytoplasm (15Le Hir H. Gatfield D. Izaurralde E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4987-4997Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 16Kataoka N. Diem M.D. Kim V.N. Yong J. Dreyfuss G.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, the EJC provides a link between pre-mRNA splicing and downstream events, including mRNA nuclear export, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (reviewed in Refs. 20Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar and 21Le Hir H. Nott A. Moore M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 215-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), and translation (22Wiegand H.L. Lu S. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11327-11332Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23Nott A. Le Hir H. Moore M.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The functional characterization of barentsz, the fly ortholog of MLN51, was especially supportive because it gave clues regarding MLN51 function. Barentsz was found to be in the oskar mRNA localization complex (5van Eeden F.J. Palacios I.M. Petronczki M. Weston M.J. St. Johnston D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), indicating that this protein acts directly on the fate of some mRNAs. Introduction of the mouse Mln51 gene into barentsz-deficient flies showed that MLN51 recapitulates some barentsz-specific features such as its subcellular localization, its interaction with staufen, and its incorporation into the oskar mRNA localization complex (24Macchi P. Kroening S. Palacios I.M. Baldassa S. Grunewald B. Ambrosino C. Goetze B. Lupas A. St. Johnston D. Kiebler M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, MLN51 cannot rescue the barentsz-mutant phenotype, as oskar mRNA remains at the anterior pole of the oocyte in these mutant flies (24Macchi P. Kroening S. Palacios I.M. Baldassa S. Grunewald B. Ambrosino C. Goetze B. Lupas A. St. Johnston D. Kiebler M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although MLN51 and barentsz have common structural elements, the low overall homology score between both proteins might underline species-specific functions. In fly oocytes, barentsz subcellular localization is strongly altered in mago nashi mutants (5van Eeden F.J. Palacios I.M. Petronczki M. Weston M.J. St. Johnston D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential relationship between these proteins. The role of human MLN51 remains elusive. However, as Magoh is a core EJC component, we have investigated whether human MLN51 is functionally linked to Magoh in mammalian cells by interacting with EJC components and/or as part of the EJC. Probes, cDNA Library Screening, cDNA Cloning, and Sequence Analysis—For cDNA library screening, 100,000 plaque-forming units were plated on LB agar, and the nylon filter replicas (Hybond N, Amersham Biosciences) were hybridized at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.4% Ficoll, 0.4% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 20 mmol/liter sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.5% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 36–48 h with 32P-labeled MLN51-specific mouse and fish probes diluted to 1 × 106 cpm/ml. Stringent washes were performed at 60 °C in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Filters were autoradiographed at -80 °C for 24–72 h. Plaques that gave a signal were subjected to a secondary screening using the same conditions. Pure plaques were directly recovered as bacterial colonies using the pBluescript/λ-ZAPII in vivo excision system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mouse MLN51 cDNA was isolated in two steps. First, by using two overlapping mouse ESTs (GenBank™ accession numbers AI842301 and AI876771), we designed two oligonucleotides primers and amplified an 800-bp internal cDNA fragment from mouse stomach mRNA by RT-PCR. Second, this fragment was used as a probe to screen a mouse stomach cDNA library, and from the four independent clones that were isolated, the complete mouse MLN51 cDNA sequence was established (GenBank™ accession number AJ292072). The fish MLN51 counterpart (GenBank™ accession number AJ555546) was isolated by using a similar strategy. A zebrafish MLN51-specific probe was obtained similarly by RT-PCR using 14-h post-fertilization fish mRNA as template and the two following synthetic oligonucleotides: 5′ primer ACT132 (5′-GAGCATGACGTGAGAGGCCAGG-3′) and reverse primer ACT133 (5′-GGCTCTCGACTGGGTGAACCGG-3′). This probe was used to screen an 18–40-h post-fertilization zebrafish cDNA library. Inserts contained in the mouse- and zebrafish-positive clones were sequenced on both strands, and a consensus cDNA nucleotide sequence was established from the different clones using the Autoassembler software (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA). To construct the frog MLN51 cDNA sequences, we aligned overlapping ESTs from either Silurana tropicalis or Xenopus laevis, and we established the complete MLN51 sequences from both frog species (GenBank™ accession numbers BN000153 and BN000152). To identify and define the MLN51 protein family members, we used PipeAlign (25Plewniak F. Bianchetti L. Brelivet Y. Carles A. Chalmel F. Lecompte O. Mochel T. Moulinier L. Muller A. Muller J. Prigent V. Ripp R. Thierry J.C. Thompson J.D. Wicker N. Poch O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3829-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). PipeAlign is a protein family analysis tool that integrates a five-step process ranging from the search for sequence homologs in protein sequence and three-dimensional structure data bases to the definition of the hierarchical relationship between and within subfamilies. Research for other MLN51 homologous sequences in all available data bases, at both the nucleotide and protein levels, were performed using BLAST software (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59926) Google Scholar). Multiple alignments and phylogenic trees were built using ClustalW and Phylowin (Genetics Computer Group, Wisconsin package version 10), respectively. The ESPript program was used for multiple alignment representation (27Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Metoz F. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). The Protparam and Profilescan softwares were used to determine the molecular weight and the pHi. Prosite (28Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), PSORTII (29Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar), and Coils (30Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar) software allowed the finding of putative motifs for post-translational modifications, the prediction of the subcellular localization, and the identification of coiled-coil domains in all MLN51 counterparts, respectively. These software packages are available from the Expasy Molecular Biology Server. Cloning and Constructs—Poly(A)+ mRNAs from HeLa cells were subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT) or random primers and Expand reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics). The complete open reading frames of Magoh (GenBank™ accession number NM_002370) (31Zhao X.F. Colaizzo-Anas T. Nowak N.J. Shows T.B. Elliott R.W. Aplan P.D. Genomics. 1998; 47: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Y14/RNA-binding motif protein 8 (RBM8) (Gen-Bank™ accession number NM_005105) (14Kataoka N. Yong J. Kim V.N. Velazquez F.

Seol W. DeMaria M. Rosenzweig M. Jung J.U. Immunity. 1997; 6: 571-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number NM_006362) were obtained by RT-PCR using HeLa cells single strand cDNA as template and the following synthetic oligonucleotides: 5′ primer AEI-184 (5′-CCTCTCGAGATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGCTTATGGAGAGTGACTTTTATCTG-3′) and reverse primer AEI183 (5′-CACCAATATTCAGTCTAGATTGG-3′); 5′ primer AEI181 (5′-CCTCTCGAGATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGCTTATGGCGGACGTGCTAGATCTT-3′) and reverse primer AEI180 (5′-GAGGACCTGTCAGCGACGTCTC-3′); and 5′ primer AEI187 (5′-CCTCTCGAGATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGCTTATGGCGGACGAGGGGAAGTCG-3′) and reverse primer AEI186 (5′-GACTACGATCACTTCATGAATGC-3′), respectively. To generate FLAG-tagged fusion proteins, synthetic oligonucleotides containing the nucleotide sequence encoding the FLAG peptide in-frame with 5′ end of each cDNA of interest were used as 5′ PCR primers. After amplification, the purified products (Nucleospin, Macherey Nagel, Duren, Germany) were directly cloned into the pCR3.1 expression vector (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA), generating pCR3.1-FLAG-magoh, pCR3.1-FLAG-Y14, and pCR3.1-FLAG-TAP. The vectors encoding MLN51 and truncated version of the protein fused to the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) were constructed by PCR (using pCR3.1-MLN51 as template). PCR fragments corresponding to MLN51/1–703 and 1–383 were obtained using the following oligonucleotides: AEG200 (5′-GAGACAATTGCGTTCTCCGTAAGATGGCGGAC-3′) as forward primer, AGF274 (5′-CAATTGTTAACTGGAACCCCTGCTTACAAC-3′) and AGF273 (5′-CAATTGTTATGGCTCTGAGGCTGCCTCTTC-3′) as reverse primers, respectively. PCR fragments corresponding to MLN51/137–703, 137–383, and 137–283 were obtained by using AGF268 (5′-AACAATTGGGACACCAAAAGCACTGTGACT-3′) as forward primer and AGF274, AGF273, and AGF-272 (5′-CAATTGTTAGCGATGAGACTTGTTTAGCCG-3′) as reverse primers, respectively. PCR fragments corresponding to MLN-51/277–703 and 277–481 were obtained using AGF269 (5′-AACAATTGGCGGCTAAACAAGTCTCATCGC-3′) as forward primer and AGF274 (5′-AACAATTGTTATGGCTCTGAGGCTGCC-3′) as reverse primer, respectively. Finally, MLN51/377–703 was obtained using AGF270 (5′-AACAATTGGGAAGAGGCAGCCTCAGAGCCA-3′) and AGF274 as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Each fragment was directly cloned into pST1-Blue (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). The inserts were released by MunI digestion and inserted in-frame into the EcoRI site of the pEYFP-C1 expression vector (Clontech). Expression vectors allowing the production and purification of recombinant full-length (1–703) or truncated (1–351, 352–703, and137–183) proteins from Escherichia coli were generated as described above. The coding region was inserted in fusion with the tandem affinity purification (TAP) protein (Euroscarf, Frankfurt, Germany) and the polyhistidine tag at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends, respectively. All vectors were verified by sequencing from both strands. The pCR3.1-MLN51, pEGFP-Rev-NES, and pSG5-Lasp-1 expression vectors have been described before (4Degot S. Regnier C.H. Wendling C.

Purification of Recombinant Proteins in E. coli—Plasmids allowing the synthesis of full-length (1–703) or truncated (1–351, 352–703, and 137–283) MLN51 recombinant proteins together with a control plasmid encoding the TAP protein fused to a polyhistidine tag were all derivatives of pET28a (Novagen). Proteins were purified first on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or on HIS select HC nickel affinity gel (Sigma) as described by the manufacturers, and then eluted proteins were purified on calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene) as described previously (35Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were analyzed by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry on normal phase NP20 ProteinChip® arrays (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, CA) and by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE. Finally, recombinant proteins were dialyzed against 1.5× PBS containing 10% glycerol. Antibodies—The polyclonal anti-green fluorescent protein and the monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 or polyclonal anti-FLAG antibodies were from Cliniscience (Montrouge, France) and Sigma, respectively. Detection of MLN51 was done using anti-MLN51Ct or anti-MLN51Nt (4Degot S. Regnier C.H. Wendling C. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Tomasetto C. Oncogene. 2002; 21 (and references therein): 4422-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-PABP, anti-FMRP, anti-9G8, and anti-L7a antibodies were a kind gift of N. Sonenberg, B. Bardoni, R. Gattoni, and A. Ziemiecki, respectively. Cy3- or Cy5-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA), Amersham Biosciences, and Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), respectively. Immunoprecipation and Immunoblotting—For the co-immunoprecipitation of transfected proteins, HeLa cells (2 × 106) were plated on 10-cm dishes and transfected using JetPEI™ transfection reagent (Polyplus transfection, Illkirch, France) with a total of 10 μg of DNA containing various expression plasmids. After 24 h, cells were washed twice in serum-free medium and incubated for 24 h in complete medium. Cells were collected and washed in 1× PBS. Lysis was performed by incubating the cells 15 min at 4 °C in 150 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100; 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. One mg of total protein extract was incubated for 10–12 h at 4 °C with 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody affinity resin (Sigma). The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1.4 m β-mercaptoethanol, bromphenol blue). Eluted proteins were recovered from the beads by centrifugation. Total proteins, input proteins, or eluted proteins were resolved by 12 to 8% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose sheets (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked in PBS containing 3% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Rabbit anti-MLN51Ct, anti-Lasp-1, anti-PABP, anti-L7a, anti-FLAG polyclonal sera, mouse anti-FMRP, and anti-FLAG monoclonal sera were used as primary antibodies at dilutions of 1/2000, 1/5000, 1/1000, 1/2000, 1/2000, 1/5000 and 1/10000, respectively. After washing, the blots were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse at 1/10000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antigoat at 1/1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used. Finally, protein-antibody complexes were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce). Cell Fractionation Using Sucrose Gradient Sedimentation—Confluent 15-cm dishes of HeLa or MCF7 cells were washed twice in cold PBS, and cells were collected by gentle scraping in PBS. After centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 250 mm sucrose, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Cell lysates were then homogenized with 15 strokes in a 5-ml Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again. The supernatant was aliquoted, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. For cell fractionation, 150 μl of 10 mg/ml cell extract was mixed with an equal volume of gradient buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded on 4 ml of 10–40% linear sucrose gradient. One-tenth of the collected fractions was analyzed by Western blot. For cell fractionation after RNase treatment, cell extracts were incubated with 10 μg of RNase A and 50 units of RNase T1 for 15 min at 37 °C before loading on the gradient as described above. For cell fractionation under EDTA treatment, cell extracts were mixed with an equal volume of gradient buffer containing 30 mm EDTA and devoid of MgCl2, incubated on ice 15 min, and loaded on a 4-ml 10–40% linear sucrose gradient containing 30 mm EDTA. After centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C, 300-μl aliquots were collected from the top to the bottom of the gradient and labeled as fraction 1–14. To visualize ribosomal RNA, RNA extraction was performed using the RNASolv® reagent (Omega Bio-tek, Lilburn, GA) from one-tenth of each collected fraction. RNAs were analyzed by denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide. Oligo(dT) Chromatography, RNA Homopolymers Binding Assay, and Northwestern Analysis—Purification of poly(A)-containing mRNPs present in polyribosomes was done as described by Lindberg and Sundquist (36Lindberg U. Sundquist B. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 451-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, fractions from sucrose gradient containing L7a were pooled, dialyzed, concentrated, and incubated in 1 ml of binding buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, and 25 mm EDTA in the presence of 20 mg of oligo(dT)-cellulose (type 7, Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at room temperature. After 2 washes with 1 ml of binding buffer, elution of the adsorbed mRNP complexes was done in elution buffer containing 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, and 25% formamide. Fractions corresponding to input, unbound, wash, and eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blot for the presence of MLN51, PABP, L7a, and FMRP. MLN51 and Lasp-1 were transcribed-translated using the TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate or wheat germ systems (Promega, Madison, WI) from pCR3.1-MLN51 and pSG5-Lasp-1 vectors according to the manufacturer's conditions. For RNA homopolymers binding assays, RNA homopolymer-conjugated agarose beads poly(A), poly(G), poly(C)m and poly(U) (Sigma) were mixed to the in vitro transcribed-translated MLN51 and Lasp-1 proteins in RNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl) for 30 min at 20 °C. After three washes in RNA binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot. Northwestern analysis was performed as described (37Bertrandy S. Burlet P.

https://openalex.org/W2052078181,"Among the phenotypes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants lacking CuZn-superoxide dismutase (Sod1p) is an aerobic lysine auxotrophy; in the current work we show an additional leaky auxotrophy for leucine. The lysine and leucine biosynthetic pathways each contain a 4Fe-4S cluster enzyme homologous to aconitase and likely to be superoxide-sensitive, homoaconitase (Lys4p) and isopropylmalate dehydratase (Leu1p), respectively. We present evidence that direct aerobic inactivation of these enzymes in sod1Δ yeast results in the auxotrophies. Located in the cytosol and intermembrane space of the mitochondria, Sod1p likely provides direct protection of the cytosolic enzyme Leu1p. Surprisingly, Lys4p does not share a compartment with Sod1p but is located in the mitochondrial matrix. The activity of a second matrix protein, the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme aconitase, was similarly lowered in sod1Δ mutants. We measured only slight changes in total mitochondrial iron and found no detectable difference in mitochondrial “free” (EPR-detectable) iron making it unlikely that a gross defect in mitochondrial iron metabolism is the cause of the decreased enzyme activities. Thus, we conclude that when Sod1p is absent a lysine auxotrophy is induced because Lys4p is inactivated in the matrix by superoxide that originates in the intermembrane space and diffuses across the inner membrane.

CuZn-SOD is localized to the cytosol, nucleus, and the inter-membrane space (IMS) of the mitochondria, suggesting that it exerts its protective effect in multiple compartments (1Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Google Scholar). Another SOD that contains manganese (Mn-SOD or Sod2p) is located in the matrix of mitochondria. Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking CuZn-SOD (sod1Δ) have distinct and well established aerobic phenotypes including diminished growth, auxotrophies for lysine and either methionine or cysteine, decreased ability to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources (2Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Google Scholar, 3Gralla E.B. Scandalios J.G. Cold Spring Harbor Monograph Series 34. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 495-525Google Scholar), increased “free” (EPR-detectable) iron (4Srinivasan C. Liba A. Imlay J.A. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29187-29192Google Scholar), hypersensitivity to millimolar concentrations of zinc (5Wei J.P. Srinivasan C. Han H. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44798-44803Google Scholar), and exquisite sensitivity to redox-cycling drugs such as the herbicide paraquat (6Hassan H.M. Moody C.S. Can J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1982; 60: 1367-1373Google Scholar, 7Bilinski T. Litwinska J. Blaszczynski M. Acta Microbiol. Pol. 1985; 34: 15-17Google Scholar). All of these phenotypes (except zinc sensitivity) are also observed in mutants lacking the copper chaperone for CuZn-SOD 2This gene was first identified as part of the lysine biosynthetic pathway, hence the name LYS7. Since then, its true function, insertion of copper into CuZn-SOD, has been discovered. We agree with a recent proposal to rename the yeast gene CCS1 so that its name better reflects its function and agrees with the names of similar genes in other organisms. Therefore, we are using the name CCS1. (lys7Δ or ccs1Δ) and thus contain a form of the Sod1p polypeptide that is inactive because of a lack of copper in the active site (5Wei J.P. Srinivasan C. Han H. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44798-44803Google Scholar, 8Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J. Casareno R.L. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Google Scholar). Mutants lacking Sod2p have a less dramatic phenotype; they are sensitive to redox cycling drugs and grow poorly on nonfermentable carbon sources but show no aerobic auxotrophies (2Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Google Scholar). Many cellular components are susceptible to oxidative damage, including proteins, lipids, and DNA (9Costa V. Moradas-Ferreira P. Mol. Aspects Med. 2001; 22: 217-246Google Scholar, 10Jamieson D.J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1511-1527Google Scholar). However, targets of superoxide-specific damage are much more limited. A particular type of protein prosthetic group, solvent-exposed 4Fe-4S clusters occurring in nonelectron transfer proteins, have been shown to be specifically damaged by superoxide at low concentrations (11Beinert H. Holm R.H. Munck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Google Scholar). These clusters differ from the iron-sulfur clusters found in electron transfer proteins in that one iron atom, rather than being covalently bound to the enzyme, is labile and able to interact with its substrate to promote dehydration. The most extensively studied enzyme of this class is aconitase, a dehydratase of the tricarboxylic acid cycle located in the mitochondrial matrix. Aconitase is subject to reversible inactivation by superoxide resulting in loss of the labile iron atom, leaving a 3Fe-4S cluster (12Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Google Scholar, 13Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Google Scholar). We have observed previously reversible inactivation of aconitase in yeast lacking Mn-SOD (14Longo V.D. Liou L.L. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 131-142Google Scholar) supporting a model of superoxide-mediated inactivation of 4Fe-4S cluster enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix. Studies in bacterial systems have shown that two 4Fe-4S cluster containing dehydratases, dihydroxy-acid dehydratase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase (15Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1478-1483Google Scholar), are specifically sensitive to superoxide (16Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Google Scholar, 17Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Google Scholar). Inactivation of these enzymes leads to a deficiency in branched chain amino acid biosynthesis and a decreased capacity to utilize gluconate as a carbon source, respectively. In the eukaryotic organism S. cerevisiae, two enzymes share distinct homology with aconitase, homoaconitase (Lys4p) and isopropylmalate dehydratase (Leu1p). These enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of lysine and leucine, respectively. Lys4p catalyzes the conversion of cis-homoaconitate to homoisocitrate as part of the α-aminoadipate pathway of lysine biosynthesis (18Irvin S.D. Bhattacharjee J.K. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 401-408Google Scholar). Although it has not been directly proven to contain a 4Fe-4S cluster, Lys4p is homologous to aconitase, particularly at active site residues involved in the 4Fe-4S cluster coordination (18Irvin S.D. Bhattacharjee J.K. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 401-408Google Scholar, 19Bhattacharjee J.K. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 12: 131-151Google Scholar), and its activity can be inhibited by iron chelators (20Flint D.H. Allen R.M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2315-2334Google Scholar). Lys4p is therefore a potential target for superoxide-mediated inactivation. Leu1p catalyzes a two-step reaction that converts α-isopropylmalate to β-isopropylmalate during leucine biosynthesis and is located in the cytosol (18Irvin S.D. Bhattacharjee J.K. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 401-408Google Scholar). Yeast defective in formation of cytosolic Fe-S clusters exhibit a leucine auxotrophy (21Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Google Scholar) indicating the necessity of the Leu1p Fe-S cluster. Fe-S cluster metabolism is an important process as indicated by (a) the abundance of enzymes requiring some form of cluster, and (b) the fact that mutations affecting cluster synthesis are often lethal. Fe-S synthesis occurs in the mitochondria, and defects in the biosynthetic pathway generally result in dramatic accumulation of iron within the mitochondria (22Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Google Scholar, 23Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Google Scholar, 24Voisine C. Cheng Y.C. Ohlson M. Schilke B. Hoff K. Beinert H. Marszalek J. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1483-1488Google Scholar). Iron entry into the mitochondria for Fe-S cluster production, as well as heme synthesis, requires a mitochondrial membrane potential, a reducing environment, and the availability of ATP and NADH (25Muhlenhoff U. Richhardt N. Gerber J. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29810-29816Google Scholar, 26Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18989-18996Google Scholar). A tight lysine auxotrophy is a classic phenotype of sod1Δ yeast. We hypothesized that Lys4p is susceptible to superoxide inactivation and that this sensitivity leads to the lysine auxotrophy. A leucine auxotrophy has not been reported for sod1Δ yeast, but based on the above information we decided to look for and found a previously undescribed leaky leucine auxotrophy in sod1Δ yeast. In this study we demonstrate inactivation of the iron-sulfur cluster enzymes Lys4p and Leu1p in the sod1Δ mutant under aerobic conditions. In addition, we localize Lys4p in the mitochondrial matrix and show that levels of mitochondrial total and free iron are similar in wild type and sod1Δ strains. Overall, we conclude that both auxotrophies are caused by direct inactivation of the respective protein by superoxide and that Sod1p protects them by lowering superoxide levels. In the case of Lys4p, the protection by Sod1p is exerted from one compartment (the IMS) across a membrane barrier to the matrix and is required despite the presence of Mn-SOD in the matrix. Yeast Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—Strains are listed in Table I (27Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Genet. 1989; 16: 7-12Google Scholar). Plasmid pADCl (30Spain B.H. Koo D. Ramakrishnan M. Dzudzor B. Colicelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25435-25444Google Scholar) was obtained from Catherine F. Clarke. Plasmid pADCL-LYS4-HA, a high copy plasmid carrying an epitope-tagged homoaconitase gene, was prepared as follows. A 2-kb fragment containing the LYS4 gene was obtained by PCR of genomic DNA isolated from yeast strain S288C using PCR primers 5′-TCGCGTCGACATGCTACGATCAACCACATTTACTCG and 5′-AGATATTTCGGGCCGCCCTAGTTGGGATTTGACCCAACCTTCC. This fragment was digested with SalI and NotI and cloned into the polylinker site of plasmid pADCL, which contains a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag, creating plasmid pADCL-LYS4-HA. This plasmid was transformed into the wild type yeast strains EG103, MO-59–13c, and X3356-1B by using standard yeast transformation procedures. To reintroduce the LEU2 gene, strains EG103 and EG118 were transformed with plasmid YIp351 (31Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Google Scholar) to create EG103L (wild type LEU2) and EG118L (sod1Δ LEU2). In strain JW101 (lys1Δ) the LEU2 gene was introduced as part of the deletion of CCS1(LYS7). These strains were used to examine the activity of Leu1p.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainRelevant genotypeComplete genotypeSourceEG103Wild typeMATα leu2 his3 trp1 ura328EG103LWild type/LEU2EG103 with YIp351This workEG118sod1ΔMATα leu2 his3 trp1 ura3 sod1Δ::URA328EG110sod2ΔMATα leu2 his3 trp1 ura3 sod2Δ::TRP127EG118Lsod1Δ/LEU2EG118 with YIp351This workLL101EG103/LYS4-HAEG103 with pADCL-LYS4-HAThis workJW101ccs1Δ (lys7Δ)MATα leu2 his3 trp1 ura3 ccs1Δ::LEU25BY4741Wild typeMATa leu2 his3 met15 ura3PurchasedaFrom Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL.BY4741-6913sod1ΔMATa leu2 his3 met15 ura3 sod1Δ::KANRPurchasedaFrom Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL.BY4741-614ccs1ΔMATa leu2 his3 met15 ura3 ccs1Δ::KANRPurchasedaFrom Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL.MO-59-13clys4Δlys429X3356-1Blys4ΔMATα lys4 gal2J. K. Bhattacharjeea From Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL. Open table in a new tab Unless otherwise stated, all experiments in liquid media were performed in synthetic medium with 2% glucose (SD) supplemented with amino acids, adenine, and uracil as described (32Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 207-210Google Scholar). In addition, a 4-fold excess of the supplements tryptophan, leucine, uracil, adenine, methionine, and histidine was added (SDC). Specific amino acids were dropped out as indicated (e.g. SD-Leu is SDC with leucine omitted). Growth was followed by monitoring the turbidity at 600 nm (A600; A600 of 1 = 1 × 107 cells/ml). For paraquat studies, yeast pre-cultures were grown in standard YPD media and inoculated at an initial A600 of 0.05, although all other experiments used pre-cultures grown in SDC. For the Lys4p experiments, cultures were inoculated in SDC at an A600 of 0.025 for EG103/EG110 and an A600 of 0.05 for EG118. These cultures were allowed to grow at 30 °C, 220 rpm until mid-log phase (A600 of 1–2), spun down, washed, and resuspended in SD-Leu-Lys-Trp. This medium was used so that the effect of the absence of lysine could be measured under conditions where neither strain could grow, because removing only lysine would have allowed the wild type but not the sod1Δ mutant to grow. These cultures were then incubated at 30 °C, 220 rpm and collected at the indicated times. For Leu1p experiments, cultures were inoculated in SD-Leu at an A600 of 0.05 for EG103L and EG118L. Yeast for aconitase experiments were inoculated in SDC medium at an A600 of 0.05. The above cultures were allowed to grow at 30 °C, 220 rpm until mid-log phase (assays) or with timed absorbance readings as indicated. Protein Extracts—Glass bead lysis was used to prepare crude soluble extracts. Samples were processed and stored under argon or nitrogen to avoid exposure of the lysates to oxygen, preventing inactivation of the enzymes during and after lysis. For Lys4p experiments, equal volumes of concentrated cell suspension (A600 10–30) and 0.5-mm glass beads were mixed and subjected to 6–10 rounds of 1 min of vortexing followed by 1 min on ice, under argon in a septum-sealed glass test tube. Particulate matter was spun out by centrifugation at 3080 × g in a Jouan CR422 centrifuge. For Leu1p and aconitase assays, lysis was performed under nitrogen in a septum-sealed test tube using 0.5-mm glass beads with a ratio of 30 s vortexing followed by 30 s on ice, six times. Enzymatic Assays—Lysine levels were determined by measuring the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ coupled to the conversion of lysine to saccharopine by saccharopine dehydrogenase as described by Nakatani et al. (33Nakatani Y. Fujioka M. Higashino K. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 225-231Google Scholar). Lys4p activity was determined as described by Broquist (34Broquist H.P. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 17: 112-129Google Scholar) and Strassman and Ceci (35Strassman M. Ceci L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5401-5407Google Scholar) using homoisocitrate as a substrate and measuring spectrophotometrically the production of homoaconitate, which absorbs at 240 nm. Briefly, the absorbance at 240 nm of 1 nmol of homoisocitrate in 0.33 m potassium phosphate, pH 8.5, was followed for 10 min at 30 °C. The activity of the extracts was taken as the difference between the slopes obtained with and without added substrate. Leu1p activity was determined spectrophotometrically in a similar manner as described by Kohlhaw (36Kohlhaw G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 423-429Google Scholar), by watching the disappearance of citraconate (Aldrich) at 235 nm. Briefly, a 0.5-ml assay mixture containing 4 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.4 mm citraconate, and 100–300 μg of protein was assayed for 3 min in a 2-mm path length cuvette. Aconitase activity was determined spectrophotometrically as described by Gardner et al. (37Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Google Scholar) by monitoring the formation of NADPH at 340 nm. Briefly, the assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm sodium citrate, 0.6 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm NADP+, 2 units of NADP+ isocitrate dehydrogenase, and 50–100 μg of protein. The absorbance change was measured for 5 min, and the slope was calculated from the linear portion. Isolation of Mitochondria and Localization of Homoaconitase—Mitochondria were isolated from EG103, LL101, and EG118 and purified on linear Nycodenz density gradients as described by Glick and Pon (38Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Google Scholar). The partial lysis experiment described in Fig. 5 was performed as described (39Koehler C.M. Merchant S. Oppliger W. Schmid K. Jarosch E. Dolfini L. Junne T. Schatz G. Tokatlidis K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6477-6486Google Scholar, 40Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Muller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Google Scholar) except that trypsin was used, because CuZn-SOD is resistant to proteinase K under the conditions of the experiment. Briefly, samples of purified mitochondria were diluted 10-fold into 20 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mg/ml trypsin and sorbitol such that the final sorbitol concentrations ranged from 0.6 m (no change in sorbitol concentration to maintain whole mitochondria) to 0.06 m (10-fold decrease in sorbitol concentration to rupture the outer membrane, forming mitoplasts and releasing the intermembrane space proteins into solution where they are digested by the trypsin). Mitochondria/mitoplasts were then pelleted, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting to determine subcellular localization of the proteins. An ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. Polyclonal antibodies raised against yeast Sod1p were affinity-purified using cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose covalently linked to the appropriate protein (41Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against cytochrome b2 (cyt b2), Hsp60, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGD1) were kindly provided by C. Koehler (UCLA). Affinity-purified anti-HA antibody was purchased from Sigma. EPR Analysis—Mitochondrial samples for EPR were prepared by placing 150 μl of 25 mg/ml purified mitochondria (see above) into a 4-mm EPR tube (Wilmad), flash-frozen in dry ice/ethanol, and stored at –80 °C. “Free iron” (high spin rhombic Fe(III), g = 4.3) spectra were collected on a Bruker X-band spectrophotometer at 96 K using a variable temperature nitrogen gas setup with a Wilmad quartz Dewar insert. Parameters were as follows: center field, 1560 G; sweep width, 500 G; frequency 9.33 GHz; microwave power, 31.8 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 20 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; receiver gain, 1.1 × 105; time constant, 81.92 ms. Each spectrum is representative of an average of eight scans. Free iron quantification was done as described (42Srinivasan C. Gralla E.B. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 173-180Google Scholar). All EPR data processing was performed with Bruker WINEPR software. Metal Analysis—Total mitochondrial iron levels were determined on a Thermo-Jarrel Ash Iris 1000 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AE). 1 mg of purified mitochondria was placed in an Eppendorf tube, allowed to dry at 95 °C for 4 h, dissolved in 1 ml of 20% nitric acid Optima (Fisher), and incubated at 95 °C for 18 h in a sealed tube. Digestion volume was confirmed to be constant, and the full 1 ml was added to 3.5 ml of metal-free water. A blank (1 ml of nitric acid to 3.5 ml metal-free water) was also included, and the value was subtracted from each sample. The Leaky Leucine Auxotrophy of CuZn-SOD Delete Yeast—A classic phenotype of yeast lacking CuZn-SOD (sod1Δ) is their inability to grow aerobically in the absence of the amino acids lysine and methionine (or cysteine) in their growth medium (43Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski A. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 533-539Google Scholar). These auxotrophies are very tight; there is little to no growth in air without the addition of lysine and methionine to the sod1Δ strain (Fig. 1B) (3Gralla E.B. Scandalios J.G. Cold Spring Harbor Monograph Series 34. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 495-525Google Scholar) or to the ccs1Δ strain (Fig. 1C). Note that the sod1Δ and ccs1Δ strains grow well in complete medium or in medium lacking threonine. Although there is a 4Fe-4S cluster protein in the leucine biosynthetic pathway, Leu1p, that is potentially superoxide-sensitive, no defects in leucine synthesis have been reported previously for sod1Δ yeast. Such an auxotrophy may have been overlooked in the earlier studies because many of the parental strains utilized carried a leu2 mutation and were therefore unable to synthesize leucine, regardless of the status of Leu1p (43Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski A. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 533-539Google Scholar). Therefore, we constructed LEU2+ strains EG103L and EG118L by transforming EG103 and EG118 strains with an integrating plasmid carrying the LEU2 gene. We then examined the ability of EG103L and EG118L to grow aerobically in medium lacking leucine. These experiments showed that there is a leaky auxotrophy for leucine in strains lacking CuZn-SOD activity, and strains with sod1Δ or ccs1Δ mutations grew much more slowly without leucine (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained with sod1Δ and ccs1Δ mutants derived from the S. cerevisiae strain BY4741 (data not shown). As with the methionine and lysine auxotrophies, the leucine auxotrophy was not observed in sod1Δ cells grown anaerobically or in strains lacking the matrix enzyme Mn-SOD (SOD1+sod2Δ) (data not shown). Induced Amino Acid Auxotrophies in Wild Type Yeast Exposed to Paraquat—The bipyridyl herbicide paraquat (methyl viologen) is known to give rise to intracellular superoxide production, and sod1Δ yeast are exquisitely sensitive to it. Elevated concentrations of paraquat in wild type yeast are expected to replicate the phenotype of sod1Δ strains assuming enough superoxide is generated to overtax the ability of the cells to cope with it. Wild type cells can grow in complete medium with concentrations of paraquat as high as 5 or 10 mm (28Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Google Scholar). However, 0.25 mm paraquat induced amino acid auxotrophies for lysine, methionine, and leucine (Fig. 2), indicating that the pathways producing these amino acids are especially sensitive to superoxide. Indeed, the observed pattern is quite similar to that seen in sod1Δ yeast, and paraquat causes almost complete growth inhibition of the wild type strain in media lacking lysine or methionine and partial growth inhibition in medium lacking leucine. These data support the conclusion that the three amino acid auxotrophies of sod1Δ yeast are specifically due to the presence of superoxide and prompted us to look for inactivation of specific 4Fe-4S cluster proteins involved in these amino acid biosynthetic pathways. The Activity of 4Fe-4S Cluster Enzymes—We analyzed the activity of the three aconitase-like 4Fe-4S cluster enzymes in our wild type and sod1Δ strains in order to determine whether their activities are affected by the absence of Sod1p. Aconitase is the classic example of an enzyme that is inactivated by superoxide-mediated oxidation of its 4Fe-4S cluster (13Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Google Scholar). Aconitase has been reported to be inactivated in yeast lacking either Mn-SOD (sod2Δ) (14Longo V.D. Liou L.L. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 131-142Google Scholar) or CuZn-SOD (44Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Google Scholar), and we found similar results under the conditions used in the present study (Fig. 3A). The addition of 1 mm paraquat to the wild type strain also caused a decrease in aconitase activity. Thus aconitase is susceptible to inactivation by superoxide produced by both natural and artificial means. Because aconitase is not a rate-limiting enzyme, decreases in its activity do not necessarily affect growth or respiration rate. Mn-SOD and aconitase are both located in the mitochondrial matrix, so it is perhaps not surprising that aconitase activity is decreased in sod2Δ strains. The fact that aconitase activity was also affected in sod1Δ yeast is harder to explain, because the two proteins are not present in the same cellular compartment. The activity of Lys4p, the 4Fe-4S cluster containing enzyme in the lysine biosynthetic pathway, was measured in the sod1Δ, the sod2Δ, and wild type yeast that had been grown for 12 h in medium lacking lysine, tryptophan, and leucine. We observed a dramatic difference between wild type and the mutants, although the specific activity of Lys4p was low even in wild type cells (Fig. 3B). This result is somewhat surprising, as the sod2Δ mutant does not exhibit a lysine auxotrophy. To address this point, we measured free lysine levels in the three strains, and we found that there was 12.5 ± 2 nmol per mg of protein in wild type, 5.0 ± 0.8 nmol per mg of protein in sod1Δ, and 16.0 ± 2 nmol per mg of protein in sod2Δ. The level of free lysine in the sod1Δ mutant was less than half that of wild type, indicating that the inactivation of Lys4p in this strain affected the amount of available lysine and providing a good explanation for the observed lysine auxotrophy. The sod2Δ strain actually had a slightly higher level of lysine than the wild type strain, consistent with the fact that sod2Δ yeasts do not exhibit a lysine auxotrophy. It remains unclear why the sod2Δ strain can still make wild type levels of lysine with the drastically lowered enzyme activity that we observed. To test whether the inactivation of the cytosolic 4Fe-4S cluster protein Leu1p could be the cause of the leaky leucine auxotrophy, we measured its activity in sod1Δ, sod2Δ, and wild type yeast, as well as wild type yeast exposed to paraquat. In sod1Δ and wild type plus paraquat, the Leu1p activity was approximately half that of the wild type control (Fig. 3C). The moderate level of inactivation correlates well with the observed leakiness of the leucine auxotrophy; enough leucine is produced to support some growth but at a lower rate. Because Leu1p and Sod1p are both cytosolic proteins, it seems likely that Sod1p exerts a direct protective effect. The sod2Δ strain had the same Leu1p activity as wild type, indicating that the matrix-localized Mn-SOD plays little or no role in protecting this cytosolic protein. Restoration of 4Fe-4S Cluster Enzyme Activity by Low Oxygen—When cells are grown anaerobically, the lysine (and leucine) auxotrophies of the sod1Δ mutant are not observed (43Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski A. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 533-539Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether anaerobiosis affected the Lys4p and Leu1p activities. After 12 h of aerobic growth in SDC-Leu-Lys-Trp (Lys4p) or in SDC-Leu (Leu1p), cultures were divided in two. One of these cultures was placed in low aeration conditions (either under 3% oxygen with no shaking or under 100% nitrogen), and the other was returned to normal culture conditions, shaking with ambient oxygen conditions (high aeration). As before, under high aeration the activities of these enzymes were reduced, but 3 h in low oxygen conditions fully restored the Lys4p activity in both sod1Δ and sod2Δ cells (Fig. 4A) and the Leu1p activity in sod1Δ (Fig. 4C).

A distinct feature of class II HDACs is their ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a cell type- and signal-dependent manner. We demonstrate here that treatment with the 26 S proteosome inhibitors, MG132 and ALLN, leads to detection of ubiquitinated HDAC7 and causes accumulation of cytoplasmic HDAC7. We also show that treatment with calyculin A, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, leads to a marked increase of HDAC7 but not HDAC5. The increase in HDAC7 is accompanied by enhanced interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and HDAC7. HDAC7 mutations that prevent the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins also block calyculin A-mediated stabilization. Expression of constitutively active calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase I stabilizes HDAC7 and causes an increased association between HDAC7 and 14-3-3. Together, our results suggest that calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase I-mediated phosphorylation of HDAC7 acts, in part, to promote association of HDAC7 with 14-3-3 and stabilizes HDAC7.

Acetylation and deacetylation of histone tails are critical mechanisms regulating gene expression. Acetylation of histone tails has been suggested to play a role in remodeling chromatin and to serve as signals for specific recognition by transcription factors and chromatin remodeling proteins (1Ajiro K.

HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9 constitute a subclass that contain a catalytic domain in their carboxyl-terminal region and an N-terminal noncatalytic region showing limited sequence homology with each other. Among these four HDACs, HDAC7 contains the most divergent sequence in its amino terminus (11Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar). This region of HDAC7 possesses, however, three short regions containing sequences highly conserved in the other class II members. In addition, association of myocyte enhancer factors 2 with class II HDACs via the N-terminal region appears to be conserved among HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9 (12Kao H.Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.C. Simon C.

Leptomycin B treatment blocks nuclear export of HDAC4, -5, and -7, suggesting a role for CRM1 in nuclear export of the class II HDACs. The N terminus of class II HDACs contains three highly conserved serine residues that are critical for nuclear export. Sequence analyses indicate that these three serines are putative targets of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs) and 14-3-3 proteins. 14-3-3 family proteins interact with phosphorylated serine or threonine-containing motifs present in proteins implicated in cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and regulation of gene expression (31Fu H.

Exogenous expression of a constitutively active form of CaMK I and CaMK IV promotes nuclear export of HDAC7 and HDAC5, respectively (12Kao H.Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.C. Simon C. Juguilon H. Khochbin S. J.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6312-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We proposed that CaMK I-mediated phosphorylation on these serine residues promotes association of class II HDACs with cytoplasmic 14-3-3 proteins (12Kao H.Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.C. Simon C. Juguilon H. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47496-47507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Mutational studies demonstrated that serine to alanine mutations abrogate both 14-3-3 binding and nuclear export (12Kao H.Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.C. Simon C. Juguilon H. Khochbin S. J. Biol.

However, it is not clear whether cytoplasmic class II HDACs associate with 14-3-3 proteins and, if they do, the functional significance of this association. Many transcription factors such as p53 and nuclear hormone receptors have been shown to be targets of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (34Blanquart C. Barbier O. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Glineur C. J.

Sci. 1997; 22: 372-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is catalyzed by a set of enzymes, E1, E2, and E3, via three sequential steps (39Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar, 40Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is first activated by a single ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1. Subsequently, one of several E2 enzymes (ubiquitin-conjugating proteins) transfers ubiquitin from E1 to a member of the ubiquitin-protein ligase family, E3, that is responsible for covalent attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues in substrate proteins. Ubiquitin-marked proteins are then recognized by the 26 S proteosome and degraded. Regulation of protein degradation by the proteosome pathway depends primarily on the ubiquitination of targeted proteins. Recent studies have demonstrated the phosphorylation of substrate proteins implicated in ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated proteolysis (41Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4086) Google Scholar, 42Willems A.R. Goh T. Taylor L. Chernushevich I. Shevchenko A. Tyers M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol.

In this study, we demonstrate that cytoplasmic HDAC7 is a target of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Increased phosphorylation leads to a marked increase of endogenous and transfected HDAC7. This phosphorylation-dependent activity requires the N-terminal conserved serine residues of HDAC7. We show that phosphorylation promotes association of endogenous HDAC7 with 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm. Co-expression of a constitutively active CaMK I promotes HDAC7/14-3-3 interactions and results in an increase of HDAC7. Our data suggest a concerted regulation of HDAC7 activity by phosphorylation-mediated nuclear export and ubiquitin-regulated proteolysis. Plasmid Construction and Reagents—The plasmids pCMX, pCMX-mHDAC7 (WT)-HA, and pCMX-1F-14-3-3ϵ have been described previously (12Kao H.Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.C. Simon C. Juguilon H. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47496-47507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The plasmids pCMX-1F-mHDAC7 (wild type), pCMX-1F-mHDAC7 (S178A/S344A/S479A), and pCMX-1F-CaMK I were constructed by PCR of HDAC7 or SRα-CaMK I expression vector (a kind gift from Dr. Anthony Means) and subcloned into pCMX-1F vector. HA-Ub + 1 expression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Sajay Pimplikar. MG132 and calyculin A were purchased from Sigma. ALLN was from Calbiochem. Anti-HDAC4, -5, and -7 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Since class II HDACs are homologous to each other, we first determined the specificity of antibodies against HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7. We found that anti-HDAC7 antibodies were specific for HDAC7 and did not cross-react with HDAC4 or HDAC5 (Fig. 1A). Similarly, HDAC4 and HDAC5 antibodies did not cross-react with their family members. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we used anti-HDAC7 antibodies generated by immunizing rabbits with GST fusion protein containing the first 254 amino acids of mouse HDAC7 followed by sequential purification by GST and GST-HDAC7-(2–254) affinity columns. The specificity of these antibodies was examined by Western blot analyses. We found that our purified antibodies were specific for HDAC7 and did not cross-react with family members HDAC4 or HDAC5 (Fig. 1B). We have also probed with preimmune serum and found no signals (data not shown). Anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies were from Sigma and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads and anti-HA agarose beads were from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Anti-14-3-3, anti-ubiquitin, anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, anti-lamin B, and anti-β-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Coimmunoprecipitation—For co-immunoprecipitations, HEK293 cells on 10 × 10-cm plates were transfected with 10 μg of the appropriate plasmids using either CaPO4 or liposomes. Cells were harvested after 48 h, washed with 1× PBS, and resuspended in resuspension buffer (1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). Cells were sonicated and cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatants were kept as whole cell extract. After preclearing by incubation with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), immunoprecipitations were carried out using M2-agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing four times with resuspension buffer, samples were boiled in SDS loading buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the appropriate antibodies. For in vivo ubiquitination of HDAC7, after treatment by 26 S proteosome inhibitors, HEK293 cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer. Co-immunoprecipitation was also performed in radioimmune precipitation buffer. Fractionation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts—Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared according to Ref. 44Dalal S.N. Schweitzer C.M. Gan J. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4465-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol with added protease inhibitors) for 30 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 × g for 3 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to yield cytoplasmic extracts. The pelleted nuclei were washed once with lysis buffer and resuspended in lysis buffer, briefly sonicated, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were kept as nuclear extracts. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using 14-3-3 antibodies followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses probed with 14-3-3 and purified HDAC7 antibodies. Inhibitor Studies—For endogenous proteins, subconfluent HEK293 cells were treated with 10 nm calyculin A for 1 h followed by cell extract preparation or fractionation. Transfected cells were treated with 20 nm calyculin A for 1 h before harvest, and the expression level of transfected proteins was examined. HEK293 cells or HEK293 cells transfected with expression vectors expressing HA-HDAC7 were treated with 20 μm MG132 or 25 nm ALLN 48 h posttransfection for the indicated time before harvesting cells. Inhibitors of 26 S Proteosome Stabilize Cytoplasmic HDAC7—To determine whether class II HDACs are subject to proteosome-mediated degradation, HEK293 cells were treated with ALLN and MG132, inhibitors of the 26 S proteosome. Cells were harvested after 2–4 h of treatment, and extracts were subjected to Western blot analyses with antibodies against class II HDACs (Fig. 2). We found that all three HDACs were stabilized by ALLN and MG132, although the degree of stabilization differed. The stabilization of HDAC4 and -5 was modest but reproducible. In contrast, stabilization of HDAC7 was more dramatic. Subcellular fractions were prepared for Western blot analyses probed with anti-HDAC7 antibodies. We found that MG132 caused an accumulation of HDAC7 in the cytoplasmic but not the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3A). Additionally, we found that whole cell extracts and the cytoplasmic fraction of HEK293 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-HDAC7 contained increased amounts of HA-HDAC7 in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 3, B and C). These results indicate that class II HDACs can be stabilized by 26 S proteasome inhibitors and that proteolysis of both endogenous and transfected HDAC7 is mediated, in part, by the 26 S proteasome.Fig. 3Cytoplasmic HDAC7 is stabilized by 26 S proteosome.A, cytoplasmic HDAC7 is stabilized by MG132. Nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) fractions were prepared, fractionated on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting probed with anti-HDAC7. Anti-actin and anti-lamin B were used as cytoplasmic and nuclear markers, respectively. B, transfected HA-HDAC7 is stabilized by MG132. Whole cell extracts were prepared, and Western blots were probed with anti-HA (upper panel) and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH)(lower panel) antibodies, respectively. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a loading control. C, cytoplasmic HA-HDAC7 in transfected cells is stabilized by MG132. Western blots were performed as in A except that fractions were prepared from cells transfected with HA-HDAC7 (B). As a control, HDAC7 (S-A), which was shown to constitutively localize in the nucleus, was included for fractionation (lanes 9 and 10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ectopic Expression of Ubiquitin Decreases the Expression of HDAC7—To test whether Ub has a role in proteasomal degradation of HDAC7, we tested the ubiquitination of this protein. Whole cell extracts were prepared from cells treated with ALLN or MG132 followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-HDAC7 antibodies and Western blot analysis using anti-Ub antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4A, immunoprecipitated HDAC7 proteins were ubiquitinated in both ALLN-treated (lane 4) and MG132-treated cells (lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, immunoprecipitation in the absence of anti-HDAC7 antibodies did not yield ubiquitination signals (lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore, cotransfection of a Ub frameshift mutant, Ub +1 (which blocks 26 S proteasome activity) (45van Leeuwen F.W. de Kleijn D.P. van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A. Sluijs J.A. Koycu S. Ramdjielal R.D. Salehi A. Martens G.J. Grosveld F.G. Peter J. Burbach H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) leads to a dramatic increase in HDAC7 (Fig. 4B) and the detection of a ubiquitinated protein whose size was similar to that of FLAG-HDAC7 (Fig. 4C, left panel, lane 4). Immunoprecipitation of Ub +1-containing lysates with M2 (anti-FLAG antibodies)-agarose beads followed by blotting with anti-Ub antibodies demonstrated that FLAG-HDAC7 was ubiquitinated (right panel, lane 4). To further demonstrate that HDAC7 is capable of being ubiquitinated in vivo, HA-Ub and FLAG-HDAC7 expression plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293 cells, and IP was carried out using M2-agarose beads. Fig. 5 shows the expression of ubiquitinated cellular proteins (upper panel) and FLAG-HDAC7 (bottom panel). MG132 treatment led to an accumulation of ubiquitinated cellular proteins and an increased level of FLAG-HDAC7. M2 beads co-precipitate FLAG-HDAC7 species that can be detected by anti-HA antibodies (lane 4). These co-precipitated species represent FLAG-HDAC7 species covalently linked to Ub, indicating that HDAC7 is a target of the ubiquitination machinery. The addition of MG132, which inhibits proteosomal degradation of HDAC7, leads to an accumulation of ubiquitinated HDAC7 (lanes 5 and 6). Together, our results strongly suggest that HDAC7 is subjected to Ub-mediated proteolysis. Phosphorylation Regulates the Steady State Level of HDAC7 and Promotes HDAC7/14-3-3 Association—Ubiquitination is not the only effector of protein degradation. Phosphorylation has been implicated in the regulation of protein stability in several systems (41Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4086) Google Scholar). To investigate whether phosphorylation might control the steady state level of HDAC7, we conducted inhibitor studies using calyculin A, an inhibitor of serine and threonine phosphoprotein phosphatases. As shown in Fig. 6A, calyculin A treatment of HEK293 cells led to a marked increase of HDAC7 but not HDAC5 or β-actin. Cell fractionation demonstrated that cytoplasmic HDAC7 was the target of phosphorylation-mediated stabilization (Fig. 6B, lanes 1 and 3). Since 14-3-3 proteins associate with phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-containing motifs in HDAC7, we tested whether hyperphosphorylation induced by calyculin A can promote HDAC7/14-3-3 interaction. Immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted and showed that the increase of HDAC7 correlated with an enhancement of HDAC7/14-3-3 association (Fig. 6C, compare lanes 1 and 3). Similar to endogenous HDAC7, transfected FLAG-tagged HDAC7 was also stabilized by calyculin A (Fig. 6D, lane 2). However, the S178A/S344A/S479A HDAC7 mutant that is defective in 14-3-3 association and is constitutively nuclear (12Kao H.Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.C. Simon C. Juguilon H. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47496-47507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) was not stabilized by calyculin A (Fig. 6D, lanes 3 and 4). These data suggest that phosphorylation increased the steady state level of HDAC7 and promoted the association between HDAC7 and 14-3-3 proteins in the cytosol. Furthermore, our data indicate that the residues Ser178, Ser344, and Ser479 are critical for phosphorylation-dependent stabilization of HDAC7. Calyculin A and MG132 Inhibit Distinct Pathways Leading to Stabilization of HDAC7—To examine whether calyculin A and MG132 exert their inhibitory effects on the same pathway, cells were treated with MG132 (Fig. 7A, lane 2), calyculin A (lane 3), or their combination (lane 4). We found that treatment of both MG132 and calyculin A had an additive effect on the expression of FLAG-HDAC7 (lane 4). Immunoprecipitation was used to examine whether FLAG-HDAC7 is ubiquitinated in the presence of MG132, calyculin A, or their combination (Fig. 7B, upper panel). Whereas MG132 treatment resulted in significant accumulation of ubiquitinated HDAC7 (Fig. 7B, lower panel, lane 2), calyculin A treatment only had a slight effect (lane 3). These results suggest that MG132 and calyculin A mediate stabilization of HDAC7 through distinct pathways. Co-expression of CaMK I Increases Steady State Level of HDAC7 and Promotes HDAC7/14-3-3 Association—Since elevated phosphorylation up-regulates the steady state level of HDAC7 and because CaMK I is responsible for phosphorylation of the conserved serine residues of HDAC7 (12Kao H.Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.C. Simon C. Juguilon H. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47496-47507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), we tested whether CaMK I was capable of regulating HDAC7 stability. As shown in Fig. 8A, ectopic expression of CaMK I or 14-3-3ϵ increased HDAC7 accumulation (top panel, lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, co-expression of CaMK I and 14-3-3ϵ results in an additive of accumulated HDAC7 (lane 4). Immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies demonstrated that HDAC7 associates with higher levels of 14-3-3 proteins in the presence of CaMK I (bottom panel, compare lanes 6 and 8), suggesting that CaMK I promoted HDAC7/14-3-3 association (lanes 6 and 8). GST pull-down assays were carried out to examine the association between 14-3-3 and HDAC7 (Fig. 8B). GST-14-3-3ϵ interacted more strongly with HDAC7 co-transfected with CaMK I. These data suggest that phosphorylation-dependent stabilization of HDAC7 is partly mediated by activation of CaMK I signaling, which in turn promotes HDAC7 association with 14-3-3. Both class I and class II HDACs have been shown to be targets of protein modifications such as sumoylation and ubiquitination. Sumoylation has been implicated in modulating HDAC1-mediated transcriptional repression (46David G. Neptune M.A. DePinho R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23658-23663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 47Colombo R. Boggio R. Seiser C. Draetta G.F. Chiocca S. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and plays a role in nuclear import of HDAC4 (48Kirsh O. Seeler J.S. Pichler A. Gast A. Muller S. Miska E. Mathieu M. Harel-Bellan A. Kouzarides T. Melchior F. Dejean A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2682-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HDAC6 is implicated in the control of protein ubiquitination (49Seigneurin-Berny D. Verdel A. Curtet S. Lemercier C. Garin J. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8035-8044Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that the steady state levels of HDAC4, -5, and -7 are sensitive to MG132 and ALLN, inhibitors of the 26 S proteosome. We further demonstrated that HDAC7 was subject to Ub-mediated proteolysis and that this proteolysis was modulated by phosphorylation of HDAC7. Our results are the first to demonstrate that phosphorylation regulates HDAC protein stability. We noted that the degrees of MG132-mediated stabilization of class II HDACs were quite different. In contrast to HDAC7, the levels of HDAC4 and HDAC5 were only moderately elevated by MG132. We speculate that this observation may be related to the subcellular distribution of class II HDACs. Indeed, we previously reported that the subcellular localizations of HDAC5 and HDAC7 are differentially regulated (12Kao H.Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.C. Simon C. Juguilon H. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47496-47507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In all of the cell lines examined, including HEP-G2, MCF7, and HEK293 cells (data not shown), a larger fraction of HDAC5 was present in the nucleus than HDAC7. In the current study, we further demonstrated that calyculin A treatment resulted in accumulation of HDAC7 but not HDAC5. It is possible that these observations are interconnected. Nevertheless, our data suggest that despite their sequence similarity, the mechanisms regulating the activities of HDAC5 and HDAC7 are distinct. Previously, we and others have shown that nuclear export of class II HDACs requires conserved serine residues in the N terminus of class II HDACs (12Kao H.Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.C. Simon C. Juguilon H. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47496-47507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 29Wang A.H. Kruhlak M.J. Wu J. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Posner B.I.

A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Mutations of these serine residues abolished 14-3-3 and HDAC7 association and also caused the accumulation of nuclear HDAC7. These results suggest a strong correlation between 14-3-3 binding and nuclear export or inhibition of nuclear import of HDAC7. Our present studies demonstrate that phosphorylation causes accumulation of HDAC7 and enhanced association of HDAC7 with 14-3-3 proteins. Furthermore, the putative 14-3-3 binding sites within HDAC7 are critical for phosphorylation-mediated stabilization of HDAC7. These data suggest that 14-3-3 proteins may be involved in stabilization of HDAC7. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that HDAC7 forms stable complexes with 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4). Interestingly, a recent paper suggested that 14-3-3 is involved in stabilization of p53 by blocking Mdm2 binding (51Yang H.Y. Wen Y.Y. Chen C.H. Lozano G. Lee M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7096-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is associated with the stability of several proteins. The peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase, Pin1, binds a phosphorylated serine/threonine-containing motif with a distinct specificity (followed by a proline residue, (S/T)P) (52Yaffe M.B. Elia A.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Pin1 is able to regulate stability of its interacting partners (53Ryo A. Nakamura M. Wulf G. Liou Y.C. Lu K.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that Pin1 potentiates p53 transcription activity by stabilizing p53, although the detailed mechanism involved is not clear (54Wulf G.M. Liou Y.C. Ryo A. Lee S.W. Lu K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47976-47979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 55Zacchi P. Gostissa M. Uchida T. Salvagno C. Avolio F. Volinia S. Ronai Z. Blandino G.

Nature. 2002; 419: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Conversely, β-catenin has been shown to be a target of Ub-mediated proteolysis in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (57Matsuzawa S.I. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 58Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of β-catenin enhanced its interaction with βTrCP, a phosphorylation-dependent E3 ligase, which promotes its degradation. These observations prompted us to investigate the role of phosphorylation in the stability of HDAC7. Our current study demonstrates that when activated, CaMK I may stabilize cytoplasmic HDAC7. Consistent with this observation, calyculin A treatment led to a marked increased accumulation of cytoplasmic HDAC7, and this activity depended on the conserved serine residues, Ser178, Ser344, and Ser479, which are CaMK I target sites. The fact that the CaMK I consensus recognition site overlaps with the 14-3-3 binding site suggests a possible coordinate action of these molecules. Our results suggested that CaMK I in cooperation with 14-3-3 proteins stabilizes HDAC7. It remains possible that kinases other than CaMK I may have a similar effect on the steady state levels of HDAC7. Two models may account for the mechanism underlying proteolysis of HDAC7. In the first, hyperphosphorylated HDAC7 is a preferred substrate for Ub-mediated proteolysis (Fig. 9A). It has been recently suggested that βTrCPs, ubiquitin E3 ligases, specifically target phosphorylated substrates for degradation (59Winston J.T. Koepp D.M. Zhu C. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1180-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 60Winston J.T. Strack P. Beer-Romero P. Chu C.Y. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). If this were the case for HDAC7, the steady state level of cytoplasmic HDAC7 (presumably phosphorylated at conserved serines) would depend on the abundance of cytoplasmic 14-3-3 proteins. Once bound by 14-3-3 proteins, phosphorylated HDAC7 would be protected from proteolysis through a mechanism yet to be elucidated. In the second model, unphosphorylated HDAC7 may be subject to Ub-mediated proteolysis (Fig. 9B). Two lines of evidence favor the latter model. First, our fractionation experiments demonstrate that Ub-mediated degradation of HDAC7 occurs in the cytoplasm where the conserved serine residues of HDAC7 are probably phosphorylated. Second, calyculin A and ectopic expression of a constitutively active form of CaMK I do not promote degradation; instead, they markedly increased the steady state levels of HDAC7. These observations favor the model in which ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis degrades unphosphorylated HDAC7 but does not exclude the first model. It will be of interest to identify the putative E3 ligase responsible for HDAC7 ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis. Our observation that calyculin A causes stabilization of cytoplasmic HDAC7 is surprising, since phosphorylation of Ser178/Ser344/Ser479 is thought to promote CaMK I-dependent cytoplasmic retention of HDAC7, and cytoplasmic HDAC7 is subject to proteosome-mediated degradation. Based on our current and previous studies, we hypothesize that phosphorylation of the conserved serine residues (Ser178/Ser344/Ser479) may serve dual functions. It may promote export of nuclear HDAC7, and it may stabilize cytoplasmic HDAC7. This mechanism ensures that newly exported HDAC7 will not be degraded once transported to the cytoplasm. Alternatively, it provides a mechanism to protect HDAC7 from proteolysis and store newly synthesized HDAC7 in the cytoplasm until there is a signal directing HDAC7 to the nucleus. The steady state level of cytoplasmic HDAC7 may vary in different cell types, depending on the abundance of signaling molecules such as CaMK I and 14-3-3 and therefore may explain differential subcellular distribution of HDAC7 in different cell types.

https://openalex.org/W2080559673,"The mammalian double-stranded RNA-binding proteins Staufen (Stau1 and Stau2) are involved in RNA localization in polarized neurons. In contrast to the more ubiquitously expressed Stau1, Stau2 is mainly expressed in the nervous system. In Drosophila, the third double-stranded RNA-binding domain (RBD3) of Staufen is essential for RNA interaction. When conserved amino acids within the RBD3 of Stau2 were mutated to render Stau2 defective for RNA binding, the mutant Stau2 proteins accumulate predominantly in the nucleolus. This is in contrast to wild type Stau2 that mostly localizes in the cytosol. The nuclear import is dependent on a nuclear localization signal in close proximity to the RBD3. The nuclear export of Stau2 is not dependent on CRM1 but rather on Exportin-5. We show that Exportin-5 interacts with the RBD3 of wild type Stau2 in an RNA-dependent manner in vitro but not with mutant Stau2. When Exportin-5 is down-regulated by RNA interference, only the largest isoform of Stau2 (Stau262) preferentially accumulates in the nucleolus. It is tempting to speculate that Stau262 binds RNA in the nucleus and assembles into ribonucleoparticles, which are then exported via the Exportin-5 pathway to their final destination.

Whereas only one Staufen gene exists in Drosophila, mammals possess two genes encoding for Stau1 and Stau2 proteins. Due to alternative splicing, three Stau2 isoforms with molecular masses of 62, 59, and 52 kDa exist (4Duchaîne T.F. Hemraj I. Furic L. Deitinghoff A. Kiebler M.A. DesGroseillers L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3285-3295Google Scholar). In contrast to the more ubiquitously expressed Stau1, Stau2 is mainly present in the nervous system. Both Staufen proteins, however, are predominantly found in the cytoplasm around the perinuclear region and associated with the endoplasmic reticulum in either untransfected or transfected cell lines (4Duchaîne T.F. Hemraj I. Furic L. Deitinghoff A. Kiebler M.A. DesGroseillers L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3285-3295Google Scholar, 5Kiebler M.A. Hemraj I. Verkade P. Köhrmann M. Fortes P. Marión R.M. Ortín J. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 288-297Google Scholar). In hippocampal neurons, Staufen proteins additionally appear within distinct RNA-containing particles in distal dendrites (4Duchaîne T.F. Hemraj I. Furic L. Deitinghoff A. Kiebler M.A. DesGroseillers L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3285-3295Google Scholar, 5Kiebler M.A. Hemraj I. Verkade P. Köhrmann M. Fortes P. Marión R.M. Ortín J. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 288-297Google Scholar). Recent work suggested that the brain specific Stau2 plays an important role in the delivery of (yet unidentified) RNAs into dendrites of hippocampal neurons (6Tang S.J. Meulemans D. Vazquez L. Colaco N. Schuman E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 463-475Google Scholar). To address the question whether RNA binding determines the subsequent cellular localization of Stau2, we introduced specific point mutations into the RBD3 that render Stau2 incompetent for RNA binding in vitro and we analyzed the subsequent cellular localization. Based on the work performed in Drosophila by Ramos et al. (7Ramos A. Grunert S. Adams J. Micklem D.R. Proctor M.R. Freund S. Bycroft M. St Johnston D. Varani G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 997-1009Google Scholar), two mutations were generated by replacing “H203MK205” to “AMA” (Stau2AMA). In a second mutant, four mutations were introduced by replacing “H203MK205... K225K226” to “AMA... AA” and the quadruple mutant was named “IV” (Stau2IV) (supplemental Fig. S1A). The two clusters of mutations are located in loop2 and loop 4 of the αβββα structure of RBD3, respectively (7Ramos A. Grunert S. Adams J. Micklem D.R. Proctor M.R. Freund S. Bycroft M. St Johnston D. Varani G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 997-1009Google Scholar). The two mutant GST-Stau2RBD3 fusion proteins showed no residual RNA binding activity compared with the wild type protein in vitro (supplemental Fig. S1B). The same results were obtained using exogenously expressed full-length proteins in BHK cells (data not shown). To test whether other mutations in the same region of the RBD3 would yield similar results, the conserved methionine (M204) between the amino acids histidine 203 and lysine 205 was mutated to alanine (supplemental Fig. S1A; control mutant Stau2HAK). This mutation did not affect the RNA binding capacity of the resulting dsRBD3, suggesting that this methionine, like in Drosophila Stau, is not involved in the binding of double-stranded RNA (see Fig. 4A, data not shown). Stau-2 Mutants Accumulate in the Nuclear Compartment— BHK cells were transfected and GFP fluorescence was analyzed 16–18 h after transfection. The majority of the GFP-Stau2WT fusion protein was detected in the cytoplasm, associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes (Fig. 1A; see also Ref. 4Duchaîne T.F. Hemraj I. Furic L. Deitinghoff A. Kiebler M.A. DesGroseillers L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3285-3295Google Scholar). An additional, yet weak, fluorescence was sometimes detected in the nuclear compartment, probably due to high levels of expression. In contrast, BHK cells expressing either GFP-Stau2AMA or GFP-Stau2IV (data not shown) mutant recombinant proteins showed a drastically altered localization pattern; they accumulated in the nucleus and, to a higher degree, in nucleoli-like structures. The observed fluorescence was confirmed by immunostaining using a Stau2-specific antibody (supplemental Fig. S2A). To exclude that any of the observed phenotype might be due to a possible truncation of the resulting fusion proteins, we performed Western blot analysis of extracts from BHK cells transfected with either wild type or mutant GFP-Stau2 proteins. Fig. 1B shows that the full-length fusion proteins (63 + 25 kDa) were not degraded. We also tested whether the observed pattern could either be due to the addition of the GFP tag or to its relative position within the fusion protein. We therefore introduced the same mutations into a cDNA encoding for Stau2 tagged with hemagglutinin (Stau2-HA). Cells were transfected with the resulting constructs and immunostained with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Wild type Stau2-HA yielded a pattern similar to GFP-Stau2, whereas cells transfected with any of the RNA-binding-deficient Stau2 mutants showed loss of the cytoplasmic localization and nuclear accumulation (supplemental Fig. S2B). To identify whether the Stau2 mutants indeed accumulated in the nucleolus, BHK cells expressing GFP-Stau2WT or mutant GFP-Stau2AMA were immunostained with anti-fibrillarin antibodies (Fig. 1C). In the latter case, the signal from GFP and fibrillarin displayed identical patterns confirming that the RNA-binding deficient Stau2 mutants reside in nucleoli. Similar results were obtained in BHK cells transfected with the construct coding for Stau2IV (data not shown). Since Stau262 was shown to have a distinct cellular distribution compared with Stau259 and Stau252isoforms (4Duchaîne T.F. Hemraj I. Furic L. Deitinghoff A. Kiebler M.A. DesGroseillers L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3285-3295Google Scholar), we tested whether Stau259 yielded the same intracellular mislocalization upon mutation of the RBD3. The AMA mutation was therefore introduced into the Stau259 cDNA tagged with EYFP at the C terminus. Both mutant Stau2-EYFP isoforms accumulated into the nuclear compartment, with a prominent signal in the nucleolus (Fig. 2). As a control, BHK cells were transfected with Stau2HAK-EYFP; they showed an identical pattern compared with Stau2WT-EYFP. This HAK mutant indicated that not all mutations residing within the RBD3 cause a potential misfolding of the resulting fusion protein that could lead to the observed nucleolar localization. We then quantified the nuclear accumulation of the various Stau2 mutant fusion proteins in BHK cells. Whereas only a low percentage of cells transfected with the two wild type Stau2 isoforms showed a significant nuclear and nucleolar accumulation (5% ± 0.7 for Stau262 and 19% ± 4 for Stau259, respectively), the vast majority of cells transfected with the two Stau2AMA-EYFP mutants displayed an altered subcellular localization. In contrast, BHK cells transfected with the Stau2HAK-EYFP mutant control showed a comparable pattern to the wild type. We then investigated whether this localization pattern was also observed in neurons. When primary cultured hippocampal neurons expressed the Stau2AMA-EYFP mutants, a nuclear and nucleolar accumulation was observed (supplemental Fig. S3A). These data suggest that nucleolar accumulation of the RNA-binding-deficient Stau2 proteins may be a common phenomenon. The nuclear and nucleolar accumulation of the various Stau2 mutants prompted us to determine whether Stau2 behaves as a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein. Computer analysis revealed two possible nuclear localization consensus sequences (NLS) located between the dsRBD3 and dsRBD4 and an additional cluster of basic residues (PRRRR) within the RBD4 (Fig. 3A). We cloned GFP in frame with the RBD3 + RBD4 derived from both wild type Stau2 and mutant Stau2AMA and transfected these constructs into BHK cells. Cells expressing GFP-Stau2RBD3WT+4 gave a predominantly cytoplasmic localization pattern (see Fig. 2). Additionally, a moderate nucleolar accumulation was observed, probably due to the absence of the other RNA-binding domains. As expected, the mutant GFP-Stau2RBD3AMA+4 was predominantly nucleolar like the mutant Staufen2AMA. To demonstrate that the nuclear localization was indeed mediated by the putative NLS, we introduced specific point mutations into the bipartite NLS in the Stau2 mutant background by replacing the amino acids KK(X)14KKR to AA(X)14AAA. The mutated construct Stau2AMANLS*+4 yielded, when expressed in BHK cells, a comparable subcellular localization to wild type GFP-Stau2RBD3WT+4. Consistent with this result, the homologous NLS in Stau1, which shares 63% identity with Stau2, is able to import a cytoplasmic protein into the nucleus in a nuclear import assay. 2L. DesGroseillers, personal communication. Interestingly, this change in the intracellular localization of Stau is not observed in Drosophila, since the Dstau deficient for RNA binding activity remains in the cytoplasm of the germ line cells. 3I. Palacios and D. St. Johnston, unpublished observation. To determine whether the RBD3 plays a role in nucleolar targeting, BHK cells expressing the RBD3 tagged with EYFP were analyzed. Fluorescence signal was detected in the cytoplasm but no significant accumulation in the nucleolus was observed. The nucleoli were free of fluorescence suggesting that RBD3 alone is not responsible for the nucleolar targeting of the fusion protein (Fig. 3A, arrowheads). In contrast, the addition of the bipartite NLS led a specific nucleolar targeting of the chimeric protein. To verify whether the NLS contained a nucleolar localization signal, cells were transfected with a construct expressing the NLS tagged with YFP. Nuclear, but not nucleolar, accumulation was observed suggesting that the NLS was not responsible for the nucleolar targeting. These results indicate that both RBD3 and NLS are needed for the nucleolar targeting. Taken together, our data suggest that the RNA binding activity in the RBD3 of Stau2 might modulate this nucleolar targeting. We next investigated whether wild type Stau2 accumulates in the nucleus or in a nucleolar compartment upon addition of leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of the CRM1-dependent protein export. BHK cells were transfected with the constructs expressing either long (Stau262-HA) or short (Stau59-HA) wild type Stau2, then treated 18 h after transfection with 50 nm of LMB before fixation. As shown in Fig. 3B, the addition of LMB did not result in a detectable accumulation of Stau2 proteins in the nucleus. Similar results were obtained even after 10 h incubation with LMB (data not shown). As a positive control, cells transfected with a construct expressing the NES-containing protein axin1 (8Wiechens N. Heinle K. Englmeier L. Schohl A. Fagotto F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5263-5267Google Scholar) showed accumulation of the reporter protein in the nuclear compartment upon LMB treatment. These results exclude a possible protein export via CRM1 but not via other potential exportins that are insensitive to LMB. Stau-2 Interacts with the Export Factor Exportin-5—The first experimental evidence for such an additional export pathway for Staufen came from work in mammalian cells identifying exportin-5 (Exp-5) as the export receptor for double-stranded RNA-binding proteins including Staufen (9Brownawell A.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 53-64Google Scholar). Recently, Exp-5 has been also identified as a carrier for tRNA (10Bohnsack M.T. Regener K. Schwappach B. Saffrich R. Paraskeva E.

Brownawell A.M. Doglio A. Bertrand E. Macara I.G. Dargemont C J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5505-5508Google Scholar) and for the nuclear export of pre-miRNAs (13Bohnsack M.T. Czaplinski K. Görlich D. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 102: 185-191Google Scholar, 14Lund E. Guttinger S. Calado A. Dahlberg J.E. Kutay U. Science. 2004; 303: 95-98Google Scholar, 15Yi R. Qin Y. Macara I.G. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 17: 3011-3016Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis confirmed that exportin 5 mRNA was present in both BHK cells and hippocampal neurons (supplemental Fig. S2C) indicating that Exp-5 is a candidate export receptor for Staufen proteins in these cell types. We therefore tested whether the RNA-defective Stau2 mutant proteins still interacted with Exp-5 by using an in vitro binding assay. The double-stranded RBD3 from either wild type, control mutant HAK, mutant IV, or mutant AA (only “K225K226” was changed) fused with GST were incubated in the presence of double stranded RNA. A significant increase in Exp-5 binding was detected for both GST-Stau2RBD3WT and GST-Stau2RBD3HAK but not for GST-Stau2RBD3AA (see scheme in supplemental Fig. S1A), when double-stranded RNA was added (Fig. 4A, +dsRNA). In contrast, mutant GST-Stau2 RBD3AA as well as the quadruple mutant GST-Stau2 RBD3IV did not show any Exp-5 binding. We then went on to verify whether Stau2 directly interacts with Exp-5 via protein-protein interaction or whether RNA mediates this interaction. In the absence of RNA, none of the recombinant proteins bound to Exp-5 in the presence of RanQ69L (Fig. 4A, +RNase). The fact that Stau2WT needs RNA to bind to Exp-5 in vitro suggests that this interaction is not direct but rather mediated by RNA. It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that Exp-5 can potentially discriminate whether Stau2 is bound to RNA or not and specifically exports assembled Stau-containing RNPs into the cytosol. To verify whether the down-regulation of Exp-5 in mammalian cells would indeed result in an accumulation of Stau2 into the nuclear compartment, we performed RNA interference (16Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Google Scholar). Constructs expressing siRNA complementary to two different regions of human Exp-5 (si-1 and si-2; target the same regions of Exp-5 as described in Ref. 15Yi R. Qin Y. Macara I.G. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 17: 3011-3016Google Scholar) were tested for their ability to reduce the level of the heterologously expressed Exp-5 tagged with c-Myc in HeLa Cells (Fig. 4B). In contrast to the si-1 plasmid, the expression of the si-2 construct led to a significant reduction of Exp-5-Myc expression. Moreover, coexpression of si-RFP did not alter the level of Exp-5-Myc-tagged protein (data not shown). To determine the effect of Exp-5 down-regulation on the cellular localization of Stau2 in vivo, HeLa cells were then cotransfected with Stau262-EYFP and si-2 plasmids. Indeed, the expression of si-2 against Exp-5 induced a clear accumulation of the fluorescent fusion protein in the nuclear compartment and in particular in nucleoli (Fig. 4C, siExp5-2). A cytoplasmic signal was still detectable. This can be explained by residual Exp-5 expression in siRNA-treated cells. The percentage of cells showing enrichment of Stau262-EYFP in the nuclear compartment was then quantified (Fig. 4C, graph; p < 0.001 Student's t test). Comparable with the expression of Stau2-EYFP alone, coexpression with si-RFP did not alter the cellular localization of Stau262. The same results were obtained in hippocampal neurons (supplemental Fig. S3B). We then repeated the experiments for the Stau259 isoform. To our surprise, the down-regulation of Exp-5 did not cause a significant nucleolar accumulation of the 59-kDa isoform as demonstrated for the longer isoform (data not shown). Several studies showed that the nucleolus is not only the compartment where rRNAs assemble with ribosomal subunits but also the place where RNPs assembly occurs (17Politz J.C. Lewandowski L.B. Pederson T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 411-418Google Scholar). Although the functional reason of the observed nucleolar accumulation is still elusive, the mislocalization of the RNA-binding-deficient Stau2 mutants suggests that the interaction of Staufen with either ribosomal subunits or alternatively with (unknown) double-stranded RNAs, i.e. tRNAs, rRNA, miRNA, or mRNAs, might occur in the nucleus. The association of Stau2 with ribosomes in a translation-independent manner has been reported recently (4Duchaîne T.F. Hemraj I. Furic L. Deitinghoff A. Kiebler M.A. DesGroseillers L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3285-3295Google Scholar). Other RNA-binding proteins also accumulate into the nucleus or the nucleolus, such as the fragile X mental retardation protein that is detected in the nucleolar compartment upon treatment with LMB due to the presence of a NES (18Tamanini F. Bontekoe C. Bakker C.E. van Unen L. Anar B. Willemsen R. Yoshida M. Galjaard H. Oostra B.A. Hoogeveen A.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 863-869Google Scholar). Another example is the human RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1. Interestingly, the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of this double-stranded RNA-binding protein is also regulated by its dsRBDs (19Strehblow A. Hallegger M. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3822-3835Google Scholar) depicting a mechanism similar to the one described here for Stau2. The NLS activity of ADAR1 is also regulated by its main RBD. The import of ADAR1, however, does not require a functional RNA binding activity. The data presented suggest the following conclusions. First, all isoforms of Stau2 protein have the potential to enter the nucleus via their functional NLS. Second, the binding of Stau2 to RNA interferes with its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. It is tempting to speculate that the RNA binding induces a conformational change in Stau2 that causes masking of the NLS. In contrast, if Stau2 is not bound to RNA, the NLS is exposed, and Stau2 is subsequently imported into the nucleus to bind newly synthesized RNA. Third, Exp-5 interacts with the Stau2RBD3 in both an RNA- and RanGTP-dependent manner in vitro but no longer to RNA-binding-deficient Stau2 mutants. Fourth and most importantly, our data suggest a functional role of Stau262 in the nucleus, where it might bind double-stranded RNA. The role of the Stau259 isoform is much less clear. Future experiments are planned to investigate the different roles of the various Stau2 isoforms within the mammalian cells in more detail and to determine whether Staufen proteins play any role in the transport of distinct RNA species.

The ω-conotoxins MVIIA and CVID are selective N-type calcium channel inhibitors with potential in the treatment of chronic pain. The β and α2δ-1 auxiliary subunits influence the expression and characteristics of the α1B subunit of N-type channels and are differentially regulated in disease states, including pain. In this study, we examined the influence of these auxiliary subunits on the ability of the ω-conotoxins GVIA, MVIIA, CVID and analogues to inhibit peripheral and central forms of the rat N-type channels. Although the β3 subunit had little influence on the on- and off-rates of ω-conotoxins, coexpression of α2δ with α1B significantly reduced on-rates and equilibrium inhibition at both the central and peripheral isoforms of the N-type channels. The α2δ also enhanced the selectivity of MVIIA, but not CVID, for the central isoform. Similar but less pronounced trends were also observed for N-type channels expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. The influence of α2δ was not affected by oocyte deglycosylation. The extent of recovery from the ω-conotoxin block was least for GVIA, intermediate for MVIIA, and almost complete for CVID. Application of a hyperpolarizing holding potential (-120 mV) did not significantly enhance the extent of CVID recovery. Interestingly, [R10K]MVIIA and [O10K]GVIA had greater recovery from the block, whereas [K10R]CVID had reduced recovery from the block, indicating that position 10 had an important influence on the extent of ω-conotoxin reversibility. Recovery from CVID block was reduced in the presence of α2δ in human embryonic kidney cells and in oocytes expressing α1B-b. These results may have implications for the antinociceptive properties of ω-conotoxins, given that the α2δ subunit is up-regulated in certain pain states.

Multiple isoforms of the β and α2δ subunits also exist that can interact with the α1 subunit to produce N-type Ca2+ channels with different gating properties, allowing the fine tuning of synaptic transmissions (11Wu L.G.

The modulatory effects of auxiliary subunits on the biophysical properties of Ca2+ channel α1 subunits have been well characterized. When expressed alone, α1 subunits produce functional channels with kinetic properties that differ substantially from those of the native channel (24Lacerda A.E. Kim H.S. Ruth P. Perez-Reyes E.

In the present study, we show that the affinity of the ω-conotoxins CVID and MVIIA to block N-type Ca2+ channel current is reduced in the presence of α2δ, and we identify position 10 in ω-conotoxins as having an important influence on the extent of recovery from channel block. Oocyte Injection and Recording—Oocytes (stages V–VI) were surgically removed from mature Xenopus laevis frogs anesthetized by immersion in 0.1% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (MS-222). The follicular cell layer was removed by incubating oocytes in Ca2+-free solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) plus 2 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma type 1) for 2 h at room temperature. Oocytes were rinsed several times, sorted, and maintained at 18 °C in an ND96 storage solution that contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 5 mm pyruvate plus 50 μg/ml gentamycin (pH 7.4). cRNA was synthesized in vitro from linearized template cDNA using an Ambion mMessage mMachine kit. cDNA encoding the rat central α1B-d and peripheral α1B-b isoforms of the N-type Ca2+ channel, as well as the rat β3 subunit, were kindly provided by Dr. D. Lipscombe (Brown University, Providence, RI). The rabbit α2δ (α2δ-1) subunit was a gift from Drs. N. Klugbauer and F. Hofmann (Technology University of Munich). Oocytes were injected with 2.5–50 ng of each subunit cRNA using a precision injector (Drummond) as indicated under “Results.” For co-expression studies, cRNAs encoding for the α1B, β3, and α2δ subunits were injected at a 1:1:1–5 concentration ratio, respectively. Injected cells were maintained in ND96 solution at 18 °C for 2–14 days prior to experiments. Electrophysiological recordings were made in a solution containing 85 mm tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, and 5 mm BaCl2 adjusted to pH 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid. Depolarization-activated Ba2+ currents were recorded using a two-electrode voltage clamp with virtual ground circuit (GeneClamp 500B amplifier; Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA). Voltage and current electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances that ranged from 0.2–1.0 megaohms in the recording solution. Depolarization-activated Ba2+ currents were evoked from a holding potential of either -80 mV or -120 mV by test voltages generated using pCLAMP 8.0 software and a Digidata 1200 series interface (Axon Instruments Inc.). Membrane currents were filtered at 1–2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Capacitative and leak currents were subtracted on-line using a -P/4 pulse protocol. Oocytes were continuously perfused with recording solution at a flow rate of 2 ml/min at room temperature (∼22 °C). Cells showing <15% change in current amplitude over a 10-min incubation period were used in these studies to avoid problems associated with current rundown. In an attempt to minimize the contamination of recordings by Ca2+-activated chloride currents, oocytes were injected with 46 nl of 50 mm 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetate solution at least 15 min prior to recording. All recordings were performed in a small volume (100 μl) Perspex bath. Deglycosylation of intact Xenopus oocytes was performed for 2 h at room temperature followed by overnight incubation at 18 °C in oocyte media with the addition of 10 units of peptide:N-glycosidase F. ω-Conotoxins were diluted in recording solution and perfused at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Recordings were made for at least 5 min in the presence of each toxin until the current amplitude stabilized before washout. For each of the ω-conotoxins studied, the rate of onset of toxin block and the rate of the measurable recovery from block during toxin washout were obtained from single exponential fits to the data using Prism software (GraphPad). The Kd for each toxin was then calculated using Equation 1, Kd=Koff/Kon(M) eq.1 where Koff = 1/τoff (s-1) and Kon = (1/τon - Koff)/[toxin] (m-1·s-1). HEK Cell Expression and Electrophysiology—HEK tsA201 cells were maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were split to 10% confluence with trypsin-EDTA and transfected 12 h later with cDNAs encoding α1B (25Stea A. Dubel S.J. Pragnell M. Leonard J.P. Campbell K.P. Snutch T.P.

Cells were moved to 28 °C 24 h after transfection and maintained for up to 7 days. Cells were transferred into 20 mm barium external solution containing 20 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm glucose, and 65 mm CsCl (pH 7.2) and recorded at room temperature (∼22 °C). Borosilicate glass pipettes of ∼3-megaohm resistance were filled with a cesium methane sulfonate-based internal solution containing 109 mm CsCH3SO4, 4 mm MgCl2, 9 mm EGTA, and 9 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Data were acquired and filtered at 1 kHz with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pCLAMP 8.0 software (Axon Instruments Inc.). Series resistance was compensated to 90%. Membrane currents were evoked every 15 s by 150-ms test pulses from -100 mV to +10 or +20 mV. Cells were perfused directly with control or toxin-containing bath solutions via a custom-built perfusion system allowing complete solution changes in <1 s. Data were leak-subtracted and analyzed with Clampfit 8.0 (Axon Instruments Inc.), and graphed in SigmaPlot 2000 (SPSS Inc.). Peptide Synthesis—The ω-conotoxins CVID, [K10R]CVID, MVIIA, [R10K]MVIIA, GVIA, and [O10K]GVIA (see Fig. 1) were assembled manually using t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry in situ neutralization solidphase peptide synthesis (39Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar), deprotected, cleaved, and purified as described previously (40Nielsen K.J. Adams D. Thomas L. Bond T. Alewood P.F.

The purified reduced peptides were oxidized in aqueous 0.33 m NH4Oac and 0.5 m guanidine-HCl (pH 7.8) for 2–4 days at 4 °C in the presence of reduced and oxidized glutathione (molar ratio 1:100:10). Oxidized peptides were purified by preparative reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (40Nielsen K.J. Adams D. Thomas L. Bond T. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Mol.

Mass spectra were measured on a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) equipped with an electrospray atmospheric pressureionization source. Radioligand Binding Assays—ω-Conotoxin displacement of 125I-GVIA from rat brain membrane was performed as described previously (41Nielsen K.J. Adams D.A. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Thomas L.

Data are from at least three experiments, each performed in triplicate. 1H NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX 500 spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient unit or on a Bruker DMX 750 spectrometer equipped with a x,y,z-gradient unit. Peptide concentrations were ∼2 mm. Hα chemical shifts were obtained from spectra of CVID, [K10R]CVID, MVIIA, [R10K]MVIIA, GVIA, and [O10K]GVIA in 95% H2O and 5% D2O (pH ∼3.5) at 293 K. Restraints used for the three-dimensional structure calculations of [R10K]MVIIA, GVIA and [O10K]GVIA were from spectra recorded at 275 and 293 K. Three-dimensional solution structures were calculated using the torsion angle dynamics/simulated annealing protocol in XPLOR version 3.851, as described previously (41Nielsen K.J. Adams D.A. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Thomas L. Schroeder T. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6741-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Effects of β3 and α2δ Subunits on the Biophysical Properties of N-type Ca2+Channels Expressed in Oocytes—Depolarization-activated Ba2+ currents were recorded in Xenopus oocytes 3–5 days following the injection of 2.5 ng of cRNA encoding for the α1B-d (central isoform) of the N-type Ca2+ channel (Fig. 2). Currents evoked by 150-ms voltage steps to 0 mV from a holding potential of -80 mV typically ranged from 150–500 nA in peak current amplitude (Fig. 2A). Co-expression of the β3 subunit at a 1:1 ratio with α1B-d increased the peak current of current-voltage (I-V) relationships 2-fold compared with α1B-d expressed without the addition of recombinant β3. In agreement with a previous report (8Lin Z. Haus S. Edgerton J. Lipscombe D. Neuron. 1997; 18: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), β3 had only minor effects on the activation and inactivation kinetics of Ca2+ channel current (Fig. 2A). Co-expression of the β3 subunit caused a significant (p < 0.001) hyperpolarizing shift in the half-maximal activation voltage (V½) from -2.6 ± 0.8 (n = 11) for α1B-d alone to -8.3 ± 0.8 (n = 16) in the presence of β3 (Fig. 2, B and C). Co-expression of the α1B-d and β3 subunits together with the α2δ subunit resulted in an additional enhancement of the peak current amplitude (Fig. 2, A and B). On average, the peak current amplitude from the I-V curve obtained in the presence of the α2δ subunit was 2-fold larger than that obtained with the α1B-d + β3 subunit combination alone. Ca2+ channel currents recorded from oocytes expressing α2δ also exhibited faster activation and inactivation kinetics during the 150-ms test pulse (Fig. 2A). Co-expression of α2δ + β3 caused a small but significant (p < 0.01) depolarizing shift of V½ for α1B-d activation to -5.2 ± 0.6 mV (n = 16) compared with β3 alone (-8.3 ± 0.8 mV) (Fig. 2, B and C). A similar α2δ-induced depolarizing shift of I-V curves has been reported for N- and R-type Ca2+ channels (29Wakamori M. Mikala G. Mori Y. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 42Qin N. Olcese R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1324-C1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α1B-b (peripheral isoform) channel current amplitude and channel properties were also modulated by β3 and α2δ subunits in a manner similar to their influence on α1B-d. Effect of β3 and α2δ Subunits on the Inhibition by ω-Conotoxins of N-type Ca2+Channel Current Expressed in Oocytes—To assess the influence of different auxiliary subunits on the pharmacology of ω-conotoxins at N-type Ca2+ channels, we compared the ability of the ω-conotoxins CVID and MVIIA and the analogs [K10R]CVID and [R10K]MVIIA (see Fig. 1) to inhibit N-type currents mediated by either α1B alone, α1B + β3, or α1B + β3 + α2δ. On- and off-rates of channel block and estimates of potency (Kd) for the different Ca2+ channel subunit combinations were obtained following application and washout of each toxin (Fig. 3, A and B). In all cases, the current decrease attributed to toxin block reached a steady state and was fitted by a single exponential function. A single exponential function also fitted recovery from block during toxin washout (Fig. 3C). The kinetics, extent, and recovery from block were determined for each toxin from curve fits. Data obtained for the peripheral (α1B-b) and central (α1B-d) isoforms of the N-type Ca2+ channel are presented in Tables I and II, respectively.Table IKinetics and extent of block by the ω-conotoxins CVID, MVIIA, and analogues on the peripheral (α1B-b) N-type Ca2+channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes alone or in combination with β3 and α2δ subunits ω-Conotoxins were applied at 1 nm (α1B-b, α1B-b + β3) or at 100 nm (α1B-b + β3 + α2δ).

CVID was less potent than MVIIA, especially at the α1B-d subunit (Tables I and II; Fig. 4A). The analogues [K10R]CVID and [R10K] MVIIA had similar profiles of inhibition of α1B to CVID and MVIIA, respectively. Co-expression of the α2δ subunit with α1B + β3 subunit dramatically reduced the apparent affinity of the N-type Ca2+ channel for the ω-conotoxins (Figs. 4 and 5), ranging from 150–680-fold at α1B-b to 80–220-fold at α1B-d (Tables I and II). At both splice variants, the effect of α2δ was most prominent for [K10R]CVID and CVID compared with MVIIA and [R10K]MVIIA. The reduction in potency induced by α2δ arose from a markedly reduced on-rate for these ω-conotoxins without any significant effect on off-rate kinetics (Tables I and II; Fig. 5). The same influence of α2δ on the kinetics and potency of ω-conotoxin block at α1B were also observed in the absence of the added β3 (Table III). Similar estimates of potency (log IC50) were obtained using equilibrium concentration-response data obtained for ω-conotoxins CVID (-9.93 ± 0.03, -7.66 ± 0.03) and MVIIA (-10.19 ± 0.07, -8.30 ± 0.03) inhibition of α1B-d + β3 in the absence or presence of α2δ, respectively (Fig. 4B).Table IIIKinetics and extent of block by ω-conotoxin CVID at α1B-d ± β3 at different holding potentials (HP) and after peptide + N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; 10 units) treatment (53Gurnett C.A.

https://openalex.org/W1994864391,"Integrin αIIbβ3 plays a critical role in platelet function, promoting a broad range of functional responses including platelet adhesion, spreading, aggregation, clot retraction, and platelet procoagulant function. Signaling events operating downstream of this receptor (outside-in signaling) are important for these responses; however the mechanisms negatively regulating integrin αIIbβ3 signaling remain ill-defined. We demonstrate here a major role for the Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP1) and Src family kinase, Lyn, in this process. Our studies on murine SHIP1 knockout platelets have defined a major role for this enzyme in regulating integrin αIIbβ3-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) accumulation, necessary for a cytosolic calcium response and platelet spreading. SHIP1 phosphorylation and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 metabolism is partially regulated through Lyn kinase, resulting in an enhanced calcium flux and spreading response in Lyn-deficient mouse platelets. Analysis of platelet adhesion dynamics under physiological blood flow conditions revealed an important role for SHIP1 in regulating platelet adhesion on fibrinogen. Specifically, SHIP1-dependent PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 metabolism down-regulates the stability of integrin αIIbβ3-fibrinogen adhesive bonds, leading to a decrease in the proportion of platelets forming shear-resistant adhesion contacts. These studies define a major role for SHIP1 and Lyn as negative regulators of integrin αIIbβ3 adhesive and signaling function.

These studies define a major role for SHIP1 and Lyn as negative regulators of integrin αIIbβ3 adhesive and signaling function. Integrins are a large family of heterodimeric transmembrane receptors mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Adhesive events mediated through these receptors are fundamental to a broad range of physiological processes, including embryogenesis, inflammation, immunity, and hemostasis (1Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Google Scholar, 2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Google Scholar, 3Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar). A common feature of all integrins is their ability to respond to environmental cues, leading to changes in receptor conformation/clustering and a corresponding alteration in integrin adhesive function. The responsiveness of integrins is due in part to their ability to respond and transmit signals across the plasma membrane in a bi-directional manner, via inside-out and outside-in signaling processes. A major pathway involved in integrin bi-directional signaling involves the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 1The abbreviations used are: PI or PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; SHIP1, Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase-1; FGN, fibrinogen; DIC, differential interference contrast; PWB, platelet wash buffer; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine; TXA2, thromboxane A2; PECAM-1, platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; Ab, antibody; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 3-kinases). These enzymes phosphorylate membrane inositol phospholipids at the 3-OH position, and are classified into 3 distinct classes based on their primary structure, mode of regulation, and in vitro substrate specificity (reviewed in Ref. 4Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Google Scholar). The Class I PI 3-kinases are activated by a diverse array of cell surface receptors and principally phosphorylate the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), generating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3). This lipid is in turn rapidly metabolized by one or more 5-phosphatases producing phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2). Both PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 have important second messenger functions within the cell, recruiting, and activating a wide range of pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing signaling proteins involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, cytoskeletal remodeling, and glucose metabolism (for review see Refs. 5Payrastre B. Missy K. Giuriato S. Bodin S. Plantavid M. Gratacap M. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 377-387Google Scholar and 6Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Google Scholar). An integrin whose adhesive function is tightly regulated by PI 3-kinases is the platelet integrin, αIIbβ3. This receptor plays a key role in regulating a variety of functional platelet responses, including platelet spreading, aggregation, clot retraction and microvesiculation, and as such, has an indispensable role in hemostasis (7Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Google Scholar, 8Phillips D.R. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Prasad K.S. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 246-258Google Scholar). The precise molecular basis by which PI 3-kinase lipid products induce integrin αIIbβ3 activation has not been clearly defined, although several target enzymes, including AKT (PKB) (9Watanabe N.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23382-23390Google Scholar) are likely to be involved. PI 3-kinases also play an important role in integrin αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling, regulating functional responses such as shear-resistant platelet adhesion, spreading, and irreversible platelet aggregation (14Yap C.L. Anderson K.E. Hughan S.C. Dopheide S.M. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 151-158Google Scholar, 15Mazzucato M. Pradella P. Cozzi M.R. De Marco L. Ruggeri Z.M.

The involvement of PI 3-kinases in integrin αIIbβ3 bi-directional signaling is well established, however the mechanisms negatively regulating integrin αIIbβ3 signaling have not been so clearly delineated. One possible candidate is the SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP1). SHIP1 has been demonstrated to be a key negative regulator of PI 3-kinase signaling in a variety of cell types (17Huber M. Helgason C.D. Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Humphries R.K. Krystal G.

S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Google Scholar) and has recently been demonstrated to play an important role in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 metabolism in platelets (23Pasquet J.M. Quek L. Stevens C. Bobe R. Huber M. Duronio V. Krystal G. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2793-2802Google Scholar, 24Giuriato S. Pesesse X. Bodin S. Sasaki T. Viala C. Marion E. Penninger J. Schurmans S. Erneux C. Payrastre B. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 199-207Google Scholar). Studies in thrombin-stimulated platelets have demonstrated that SHIP1 phosphorylation is regulated downstream of integrin αIIbβ3 (25Giuriato S. Payrastre B. Drayer A.L. Plantavid M. Woscholski R. Parker P. Erneux C. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26857-26863Google Scholar), raising the possibility that this enzyme participates in integrin αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. However, one problem with such a hypothesis is that integrin αIIbβ3 has not previously been demonstrated to promote formation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in platelets (26Gironcel D. Racaud-Sultan C. Payrastre B. Haricot M. Borchert G. Kieffer N. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 253-256Google Scholar). In fact, it has been suggested that integrin αIIbβ3 primarily stimulates PtdIns(3,4)P2 accumulation through the action of a Class II PI 3-kinase (possibly PI 3-kinase C2α), a signaling pathway that is not regulated by SHIP1 (27Zhang J.

Using SHIP1–/– mouse platelets, we have demonstrated that integrin αIIbβ3 can induce substantial amounts of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation. Enhanced PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation was associated with accelerated calcium flux and an increased rate of platelet spreading. Moreover, under flow conditions, SHIP1 played an important role in negatively regulating the stability of integrin αIIbβ3-dependent adhesion contacts. Our studies have also identified an important role for the Src kinase family member, Lyn, in regulating SHIP1 phosphorylation and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation. Our findings define an important role for SHIP1 and Lyn as negative regulators of integrin αIIbβ3 signaling.

Mouse Strains—129/C57Bl/6J SHIP1+/+ and SHIP1–/– mice (18Liu Q. Oliveira-Dos-Santos A.J. Mariathasan S. Bouchard D. Jones J. Sarao R. Kozieradzki I. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. Dumont D.J. J. Exp.

Dunn A.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 301-311Google Scholar) were generated at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (Melbourne, Australia). Antibodies—The anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-SHIP1 polyclonal serum was a kind gift from Dr. Peter Parker (Protein Phosphorylation Laboratory, Cancer Research UK, London Research Institute). Platelet and Red Cell Preparation—Human blood was obtained from healthy volunteers who had not received any anti-platelet medication in the preceding 2 weeks. Blood was anticoagulated with acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) anticoagulant (13 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm citric acid, 20 mm dextrose, and 10 mm theophylline). Washed human platelets and red cells were prepared as previously described (33Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Giuliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41377-41388Google Scholar, 34Yuan Y. Kulkarni S. Ulsemer P. Cranmer S.L. Yap C.L. Nesbitt W.S. Harper I. Mistry N. Dopheide S.M. Hughan S.C. Williamson D. de la Salle C. Salem H.H. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36241-36251Google Scholar). Human washed platelets were kept at 37 °C in platelet-washing buffer (PWB) (4.3 mm K2HPO4, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 24.3 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.5, 113 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) containing theophylline (10 mm) and apyrase (0.04 units/ml), and then resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (10 mm Hepes, 12 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose) prior to use in adhesion studies. Mouse platelets were isolated from blood collected from the inferior vena cava of anesthetized animals (60 mg/kg sodium pentobarbitone), anticoagulated with a combination of low molecular weight heparin (40 units/ml) and ACD. To obtain an optimal amount of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), blood was mixed with 300 μl of PWB and then centrifuged at 250 × g for 2 min. PRP was removed and a further 300 μl of PWB added to the remaining blood, which was centrifuged again at 250 × g for 2 min. This step was repeated, and platelets from the pooled PRP were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 1 min and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer for adhesion studies. Static Adhesion Assays—Static adhesion assays were performed using a modified method of Yuan et al. (36Yuan Y. Dopheide S.M. Ivanidis C. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21847-21854Google Scholar). Briefly, glass coverslips (12 mm in diameter; Lomb Scientific, Australia) were coated with fibrinogen (FGN) (100 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature. The uncoated glass surface was blocked with 5% heat-inactivated human serum pretreated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (50 μg/ml). Platelets (human at 2 × 107/ml; mouse at 3 × 107/ml) in Tyrode's buffer supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 (or 1 mm EGTA and 2 mm MgCl2) were allowed to adhere to the fibrinogen matrix for the indicated period of time. Non-adherent platelets were removed by gentle washing, then adherent platelets fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and imaged using differential interference contrast (DIC) or phase contrast microscopy for surface area analysis as described previously (33Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Giuliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41377-41388Google Scholar). In control studies, non-stimulated platelets were fixed while suspended in Tyrode's buffer. The increase in surface area of adherent platelets was expressed in pixels following subtraction of the surface area of resting platelets. Where indicated, platelets were preincubated with vehicle alone (0.25% Me2SO), the PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 (20 μm) or wortmannin (100 nm), the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 (10 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C prior to the performance of adhesion assays. To examine the role of ADP in platelet spreading on fibrinogen, platelet adhesion was performed in the presence of apyrase (1 units/ml, ADPase activity), while the role of TXA2 was assessed by pretreating platelets with aspirin (1 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C. The pharmacological activity of these inhibitors was confirmed as follows: PP2 (10 μm) abolished collagen (10 μg/ml)-induced platelet aggregation; apyrase (1 unit/ml) abolished ADP (25 μm)-induced platelet aggregation; aspirin (1 mm) blocked arachidonic acid (1.2 mm)-induced platelet aggregation; LY294002 (20 μm), and wortmannin (100 nm) inhibited thrombin (1 unit/ml)-induced PI 3-kinase lipid production. Mouse Platelet Adhesion to Fibrinogen under Flow Conditions—Flow assays were performed as described (33Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Giuliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41377-41388Google Scholar). Mouse whole blood anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparin (40 units/ml) was perfused over fibrinogen-coated (100 μg/ml) glass microcapillary tubes at a wall shear rate of 600 s–1 for 5 min. Platelet-matrix interactions were visualized using DIC microscopy (Leica DMIRB, Leica, Germany) and video-recorded for off-line analysis. Platelet tethering was quantitated in 5 random fields at the indicated times during perfusion, and normalized to platelet count (expressed as number of platelets per mm2, divided by the total number of platelets perfused over the 5-min period). Platelet count in blood from SHIP1–/– mice tended to be lower than that of SHIP1+/+ littermates (SHIP1–/–, 460 ± 111 × 109/liter; compared with SHIP1+/+, 590 ± 151 × 109/liter; n = 3, p = 0.296), although hematocrit was unaltered. In studies examining stability of platelet contacts, stationary adhesion was defined as an adherent platelet that did not move more than one cell diameter over a 10-s observation period. A tethered cell was classified as one which interacted with the matrix surface for a minimum of 40 ms. Analysis of Cytosolic Calcium Flux under Static and Flow Conditions—Washed mouse platelets were loaded with calcium dyes and changes in cytosolic calcium levels were monitored according to published methods (16Nesbitt W.S. Kulkarni S. Giuliano S. Goncalves I. Dopheide S.M. Yap C.L. Harper I.S. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2965-2972Google Scholar, 37Goncalves I. Hughan S.C. Schoenwaelder S.M. Yap C.L. Yuan Y. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34812-34822Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse platelets (2 × 108/ml in PWB) were loaded with Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-AM (1 μm) and Fura Red-AM (1.25 μm) for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of 1.25 μm Probenecid. Dye-loaded platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (3 × 107/ml) containing 1.25 mm Probenecid, and then allowed to adhere to fibrinogen-coated (100 μg/ml) glass coverslips under static conditions in the presence of CaCl2 (1 mm), or EGTA and MgCl2 (1 mm and 2 mm, respectively). For studies under flow conditions, platelets (1 × 108/ml) were reconstituted with packed red blood cells (50% hematocrit) in Tyrode's buffer supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, then perfused through fibrinogen (100 μg/ml)-coated microcapillary tubes at 600 s–1. To examine changes in calcium flux, sequential confocal images of adherent platelets were captured at a scan rate of 0.568 frames/s for 200 frames at the indicated time points. Real-time platelet calcium flux was analyzed from ratiometric fluorescence measurements and converted to intracellular calcium concentrations as described (14Yap C.L. Anderson K.E. Hughan S.C. Dopheide S.M. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 151-158Google Scholar, 16Nesbitt W.S. Kulkarni S. Giuliano S. Goncalves I. Dopheide S.M. Yap C.L. Harper I.S. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2965-2972Google Scholar). SHIP1 Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Washed human or mouse platelets (3 × 107/ml) in 1 mm CaCl2 supplemented Tyrode's buffer were treated with vehicle (0.25% Me2SO) or PP2 (10 μm) for 10 min, then applied onto a fibrinogen (100 μg/ml)-coated 10-cm dish for 30 min at 37 °C. Non-adherent platelets were removed and adherent cells lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 158 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm benzamidine). To examine the level of SHIP1 tyrosine phosphorylation in resting cells, non-stimulated platelets suspended in Tyrode's buffer were lysed. All lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and SHIP1 immunoprecipitated from the resultant supernatant using a specific anti-SHIP1 polyclonal Ab and protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed, then boiled in reducing conditions (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue), and immunoprecipitated SHIP1 was subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (4G10). The membrane was then stripped and re-probed with the anti-SHIP1 antibody to examine SHIP1 protein loading. Western blots were quantified by densitometry (GelPro software), and SHIP1 tyrosine phosphorylation was expressed as a percentage of control platelets. HPLC-based Phospholipid Analysis—Human or mouse platelets were washed twice with phosphate-free Tyrode's buffer containing the platelet activation inhibitor theophylline (10 mm), then labeled with 0.3 mCi/ml inorganic [32P]H3PO4 for 2 h at 37 °C. Unincorporated [32P]H3PO4 was removed by washing platelets twice with phosphate-free Tyrode's buffer in the presence of theophylline (10 mm) and then resuspended in theophylline-free Tyrode's buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2. 32P-labeled platelets were allowed to adhere to a fibrinogen (100 μg/ml)-coated glass dish for 60 min at room temperature. Non-adherent platelets were removed, adherent cells lysed, then lipids extracted and separated by HPLC analysis according to the method of Stephens et al. (38Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 105-114Google Scholar). In other studies, mouse platelets were suspended at 3 × 108/ml in Tyrode's buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2, and then stimulated with 1 unit/ml thrombin (or saline as a vehicle control) for 10 min. Control and thrombin-stimulated platelets were lysed and lipids extracted as detailed above. Phosphoinositide peaks co-eluting with commercially available PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 standards were integrated and expressed as a percentage of total phospholipid applied. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was analyzed using a Student's t test, using Prism software (GraphPad Software for Science, San Diego, CA). Adhesion-dependent PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 Formation in SHIP1–/– Platelets—To investigate the potential involvement of SHIP1 in integrin αIIbβ3 signal transduction, changes in the cellular levels of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides were examined in control (SHIP1+/+) and SHIP1-deficient (SHIP1–/–) platelets. In initial studies, lipid profiles of human and wild-type mouse platelets were examined in fibrinogen-adherent platelets (an integrin αIIbβ3-specific ligand), to determine if there were significant species differences. In both cases, PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 were barely detectable in resting platelets; however, increases in PtdIns(3,4)P2 were readily observed in spreading platelets (see Fig. 1, A–C). Notably, there was also a very small increase in the cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in both mouse and human platelets (Fig. 1, A and C). Time course adhesion studies (10–90 min) did not reveal any clear substrate-product relationship between the two lipid species (data not shown). In control studies we confirmed that the increases in PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels were dependent on PI 3-kinases as they were abolished by pretreating platelets with LY294002 (Fig. 1A). Resting SHIP1–/– platelets displayed a slightly elevated basal PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 level, compared with matched SHIP1+/+ platelets (Fig. 1, B and C). Following 60 min of adhesion to fibrinogen, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels increased significantly in SHIP–/– platelets (>10-fold higher levels than in SHIP1+/+) (Fig. 1C), representing ∼6% of the levels of PtdIns(4,5)P2 (data not shown). This increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was specific as there was no significant increase in the levels of other phosphoinositides (data not shown). Reduced PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 metabolism in SHIP1–/– platelets is typically associated with a corresponding reduction in the cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4)P2 compared with SHIP1+/+ platelets (23Pasquet J.M. Quek L. Stevens C. Bobe R. Huber M. Duronio V. Krystal G. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2793-2802Google Scholar, 24Giuriato S. Pesesse X. Bodin S. Sasaki T. Viala C. Marion E. Penninger J. Schurmans S. Erneux C. Payrastre B. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 199-207Google Scholar), a finding confirmed in thrombin-stimulated SHIP1–/– platelets (Fig. 1D) (24Giuriato S. Pesesse X. Bodin S. Sasaki T. Viala C. Marion E. Penninger J. Schurmans S. Erneux C. Payrastre B. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 199-207Google Scholar). Interestingly, in fibrinogen-adherent SHIP1–/– platelets, there was no significant decrease in PtdIns(3,4)P2 levels. In fact, there was a slight elevation in PtdIns(3,4)P2 levels in SHIP1–/– platelets, although this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 1C). To provide further evidence that integrin αIIbβ3 can regulate the cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, we pretreated SHIP1–/– platelets with an antagonist of integrin αIIbβ3 prior to thrombin stimulation. These studies demonstrated that inhibition of ligand binding to integrin αIIbβ3 prevented PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation by up to 70% (data not shown). Overall, these studies support a potentially important role for SHIP1 in regulating integrin αIIbβ3-dependent PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation in platelets. Enhanced Platelet Spreading and Cytosolic Calcium Flux in SHIP1–/– Platelets—Adhesion of human and wild-type mouse platelets to a fibrinogen matrix is associated with the generation of a sustained oscillatory calcium response that promotes lamellipodial extension and platelet spreading (37Goncalves I.

Chem. 2003; 278: 37520-37529Google Scholar). PI 3-kinases play an important role in this process by promoting calcium release from internal stores (14Yap C.L. Anderson K.E. Hughan S.C. Dopheide S.M. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 151-158Google Scholar, 16Nesbitt W.S. Kulkarni S. Giuliano S. Goncalves I. Dopheide S.M. Yap C.L. Harper I.S. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2965-2972Google Scholar). To examine whether dysregulated metabolism of PI 3-kinase lipid products resulted in alterations in calcium signaling, cytosolic calcium flux was examined in adherent platelets using a confocal-based dual-dye ratiometric assay. In contrast to a previous report in platelets (23Pasquet J.M. Quek L. Stevens C. Bobe R. Huber M. Duronio V. Krystal G. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2793-2802Google Scholar), but in agreement with reports in other cell types (17Huber M. Helgason C.D. Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Humphries R.K. Krystal G.

However, the onset of an oscillatory calcium response occurred significantly more rapidly in SHIP1–/– compared with SHIP1+/+ platelets (Fig. 2A). Significantly, there was no difference in the peak level of cytosolic calcium or the overall pattern of cytosolic calcium flux in SHIP1–/– platelets (data not shown). SHIP1–/– platelets typically spread more rapidly on the fibrinogen substrate and extended more prominent filopodia and lamellae (Fig. 2, B and C). In fact, whereas 30 min of"

In the present study the ferredoxin-dependent nitrate reductase NarB of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 was analyzed by spectropotentiometry and protein film voltammetry. Metal and acid-labile sulfide analysis revealed nearest integer values of 4:4:1 (iron/sulfur/molybdenum)/molecule of NarB. Analysis of dithionite-reduced enzyme by low temperature EPR revealed at 10 K the presence of a signal that is characteristic of a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster. EPR-monitored potentiometric titration of NarB revealed that this cluster titrated as an n = 1 Nernstian component with a midpoint redox potential (Em) of –190 mV. EPR spectra collected at 60 K revealed a Mo(V) signal termed “very high g” with gav = 2.0047 in air-oxidized enzyme that accounted for only 10–20% of the total molybdenum. This signal disappeared upon reduction with dithionite, and a new “high g” species (gav = 1.9897) was observed. In potentiometric titrations the high g Mo(V) signal developed over the potential range of –100 to –350 mV (Em Mo6+/5+ = –150 mV), and when fully developed, it accounted for 1 mol of Mo(V)/mol of enzyme. Protein film voltammetry of NarB revealed that activity is turned on at potentials below –200 mV, where the cofactors are predominantly [4Fe-4S]1+ and Mo5+. The data suggests that during the catalytic cycle nitrate will bind to the Mo5+ state of NarB in which the enzyme is minimally two-electron-reduced. Comparison of the spectral properties of NarB with those of the membrane-bound and periplasmic respiratory nitrate reductases reveals that it is closely related to the periplasmic enzyme, but the potential of the molybdenum center of NarB is tuned to operate at lower potentials, consistent with the coupling of NarB to low potential ferredoxins in the cell cytoplasm. Bacterial cytoplasmic assimilatory nitrate reductases are the least well characterized of all of the subgroups of nitrate reductases.

Nitrate is a widely used and readily available source of inorganic nitrogen for plants and microorganisms (1Falkowski P.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 272-275Google Scholar). Fixed inorganic nitrogen is mainly supplied to natural environments either from human agricultural or industrial activities or from biological nitrogen fixation. Most of it is converted to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria, and the nitrate then serves as a nitrogen source for assimilation or as a respiratory electron acceptor. Bacterial nitrate reductases are molybdoenzymes that can catalyze the two-electron reduction of nitrate to nitrite and can be classified into three groups according to their localization and function (2Richardson D.J. Berks B.C. Russell D.A. Spiro S. Taylor C.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 165-178Google Scholar). Respiratory membrane-bound nitrate reductases are generally integral membrane protein complexes with the active site located on the cytoplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane and are constituted by subunits (e.g. NarI and NarH) that mediate electron transfer from the quinol pool to the catalytic subunit, NarG, which contains a bismolybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (bis-Mo-MGD) 1The abbreviations used are: bis-Mo-MGD, bismolybdopterin guanine dinucleotide; NarB, Synechococcus sp.

These membrane-bound nitrate reductases couple quinol oxidation by nitrate to the generation of a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient, and their synthesis is normally unaffected by ammonium but repressed by oxygen (2Richardson D.J.

Periplasmic nitrate reductases are also linked to quinol oxidation in respiratory electron transport chains, but they have a range of different functions including the disposal of reducing equivalents during aerobic growth and nitrate respiration in nitrate-limited environments (5Ellington M.J. Bhakoo K.K. Sawers G. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4767-4774Google Scholar, 6Potter L.C. Millington P. Griffiths L. Thomas G.H. Cole J.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 77-84Google Scholar). In periplasmic nitrate reductases, electrons from quinol are generally passed through one or two cytochrome c-containing proteins (NapC and NapB) to the catalytic subunit, NapA, that contains a bis-Mo-MGD cofactor and a [4Fe-4S] cluster (7Breton J.

Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 928-934Google Scholar). As with the membrane-bound nitrate reductases, synthesis of the periplasmic nitrate reductase is insensitive to ammonium, but the enzyme can be expressed either anaerobically or aerobically depending on the organism (2Richardson D.J. Berks B.C. Russell D.A. Spiro S. Taylor C.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 165-178Google Scholar). The periplasmic and membrane-bound nitrate reductases are catalytically quite distinct (2Richardson D.J. Berks B.C. Russell D.A. Spiro S. Taylor C.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 165-178Google Scholar). This distinctness is reflected in their molecular structures that show that cysteine provides a thiol ligand to the molybdenum atom in the periplasmic enzymes, whereas aspartate provides one or two oxygen ligands to the molybdenum atom in the membrane-bound enzymes (3Jormakka M. Richardson D. Byrne B. Iwata S. Structure. 2004; 12: 95-104Google Scholar, 4Bertero M.G. Rothery R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct.

As a result the two enzyme groups exhibit quite distinct Mo(V) EPR spectra (8Butler C.S. Charnock J.M. Bennett B. Sears H.J. Reilly A.J. Ferguson S.J. Garner C.D. Lowe D.J. Thomson A.J. Berks B.C. Richardson D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9000-9012Google Scholar). In contrast to the wealth of spectroscopic and structural data on the two groups of respiratory nitrate reductases, no detailed spectropotentiometric analysis has been carried out on any bacterial assimilatory nitrate reductase, despite the importance of such enzymes in the eutrophication and subsequent spoilage of many fresh and marine water systems (1Falkowski P.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 272-275Google Scholar). Genes or enzymes for assimilatory nitrate reduction have been described from various bacterial sources (11Lin J.T. Stewart V. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 1-30Google Scholar), including several strains of cyanobacteria (12Flores E. Herrero A. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 487-517Google Scholar), Klebsiella oxytoca (13Lin J.T. Goldman B.S. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2370-2378Google Scholar), Bacillus subtilis (14Ogawa K. Akagawa E. Yamane K. Sun Z.W. LaCelle M. Zuber P. Nakano M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1409-1413Google Scholar), and Azotobacter vinelandii (15Gangeswaran R. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 103-108Google Scholar). In A. vinelandii and cyanobacteria the enzymes are monomeric cytoplasmic or thylakoid-associated proteins that contain molybdenum, iron, and acid-labile sulfide and use flavodoxin, in the case of A. vinelandii (15Gangeswaran R. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 103-108Google Scholar), or ferredoxin and flavodoxin, in the case of the cyanobacteria (16Mikami B. Ida S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 791: 294-304Google Scholar, 17Hirasawa M. Rubio L.M. Griffin J.L. Flores E. Herrero A. Li J. Kim S.K. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Knaff D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1608: 155-162Google Scholar), as the physiological electron donor. The synthesis of assimilatory nitrate reductases in bacteria is insensitive to aerobiosis but inhibited by ammonium, contrasting with both the respiratory nitrate reductase groups (11Lin J.T. Stewart V. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 1-30Google Scholar, 12Flores E. Herrero A. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 487-517Google Scholar). Cyanobacteria are a highly significant group of phototrophic bacteria in ecological terms as they make a dominant contribution to carbon and nitrogen cycling in many environments on Earth (1Falkowski P.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 272-275Google Scholar). They carry out oxygenic photosynthesis using a photosynthetic apparatus that is similar to that of the chloroplasts of eukaryotic algae and higher plants, of which the cyanobacterial system is considered to represent the phylogenetic ancestor (12Flores E. Herrero A. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 487-517Google Scholar). Cyanobacteria preferentially use inorganic nitrogen for growth, being able as a group to assimilate nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and dinitrogen. The assimilation of nitrate by cyanobacteria takes place in the cytoplasm. Thus, the process first requires the entrance of nitrate into the cell, for which a high affinity active transport system exists. Transport is then followed by the two-electron reduction of nitrate to nitrite catalyzed by the assimilatory nitrate reductase and the further six-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonium by a siroheme-containing nitrite reductase. The ammonium is then incorporated into carbon skeletons, mainly utilizing the glutamine synthetase (GS)/glutamine:2-oxoglutarate amidotransferase (GOGAT) pathway (12Flores E. Herrero A. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 487-517Google Scholar, 18Luque I. Flores E. Herrero A. Plant Mol.

Acta. 1994; 1184: 296-298Google Scholar). In recent years, a wealth of knowledge on the genetics of nitrate reduction in cyanobacteria has been obtained, mainly through studies in the unicellular strain Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 (21Rubio L.M. Herrero A. Flores E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 845-850Google Scholar, 22Rubio L.M. Flores E. Herrero A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1200-1206Google Scholar, 23Rubio L.M. Flores E. Herrero A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 358-362Google Scholar). Recently the heterologous expression, purification, and kinetic characterization of the ferredoxin-dependent nitrate reductase, NarB, of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 was reported (24Rubio L.M. Flores E. Herrero A. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 72: 13-26Google Scholar), which used metal and chemical analysis to confirm the presence of an iron-sulfur center and a bis-Mo-MGD cofactor and identified cysteine residues important in binding the cluster. However, the molecular nature of the cluster (i.e. [3Fe-4S] or [4Fe-4S]) could not be unambiguously determined. The present paper provides a spectropotentiometric and film voltammetric analysis of NarB, the first such study for any bacterial assimilatory nitrate reductase. This work resolves the nature of the cofactors and reveals some intriguing redox properties of the enzyme. These results are considered in the light of recent studies on quinol-dependent membrane-bound and periplasmic respiratory nitrate reductase systems and the distinct physiological role of NarB in ferredoxin-dependent nitrate assimilation. Organisms, Growth Conditions, and Plasmids—The Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Stratagene) was used for expression of recombinant protein. E. coli was grown in Luria-Bertani medium. The plasmid pC-SLM85, encoding NarB with a hexahistidine tag fused to its C terminus, has been described previously (24Rubio L.M. Flores E. Herrero A. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 72: 13-26Google Scholar). Expression of NarB—E. coli strain DH5α was used for the expression of pCSLM85. Cultures were grown overnight to saturation in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. An aliquot of the overnight culture was diluted 1:25 in LB medium and grown at 37 °C. At A600 of 0.6, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were grown at 37 °C for 3 h. The induced cells were harvested, washed, and collected by centrifugation. Enzyme Assays and Protein Determinations—Nitrate reductase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by substrate-dependent oxidation of reduced methyl viologen (ϵ600 nm = 13,700 m–1 cm–1). Assays (3-ml final volume) were carried out by mixing at 25 °C in anaerobic cuvettes containing 0.5 mm methyl viologen, 25 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0, and nitrate, chlorate, selenate, tellurate, or nitrite. Methyl viologen was reduced by the addition of 0.5 mm sodium dithionite, and turnover was initiated by the addition of purified NarB (40 nm). Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten description of enzyme kinetics to determine Km and kcat for the tested substrates. Protein determination was by the methods of Markwell et al. (25Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Google Scholar) or Bradford (26Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Purification of NarB—The cell pellet containing NarB was resuspended in 5 volumes (v/w) buffer A (25 mm Hepes, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol). The cells were then lysed by French press disruption, and the crude extract was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was chromatographed on a 25-ml TALON column charged with Ni2+ (BD Biosciences) in buffer A with a superimposed 200-ml linear gradient from 10 to 250 mm imidazole. The fractions were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the fractions containing NarB were identified through specific interaction with antibodies against histidine tags. The peak fractions of NarB were pooled, buffer-exchanged to remove the imidazole, and concentrated using a Centricon Plus-20 concentrator (molecular mass cutoff, 30,000 Da; Millipore Corp.). The protein was then loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted in 25 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. All purification steps, except for gel filtration, were carried out at 4 °C. The protein was stored either at –80 °C or in liquid nitrogen because of the lability of NarB at 4 °C for prolonged periods of time. Potentiometric Titrations—Chemical redox titrations were performed with the sample stirred in a glass cell housed in an anaerobic chamber and thermostatted at 4 °C with platinum working and calomel reference electrodes. Potassium ferricyanide was used to fully oxidize the protein to 400 mV, and dithionite was used as the reductant in the potential range of 50 to –550 mV. Titrations were performed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl. Electrode-solution mediation was facilitated by the following mediators at a 10 μm concentration: neutral red, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, safranine T, and phenosafranine. After equilibration at each potential, a 300-μl sample was removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the EPR spectrum was recorded. All potentials are given relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. Spectroscopy—Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX system X-band spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instrument ESR-9 liquid helium flow cryostat and a dual mode EPR cavity. Spin quantification of the EPR signals due to the [4Fe-4S] cluster and Mo(V) was estimated by double integration and comparison with a 2 mm Cu-EDTA standard, all measured under non-saturating conditions. Conditions of measurement are as described in the appropriate figure legends. EPR simulation was carried out using WINEPR Simfonia Version 1.25 (Bruker). Where simulations are presented, experimental and simulated spectra are aligned with a magnetic field range corresponding to a microwave frequency of 9.6800 GHz. UV-visible absorption spectra of purified NarB were obtained on a Hitachi U4001 UV-visible spectrometer. Protein Film Voltammetry—Protein film voltammetry was performed with a three-electrode cell configuration housed in an anaerobic chamber as described previously (27Butt J.N. Anderson L.J. Rubio L.M. Richardson D.J. Flores E. Herrero A. Bioelectrochemistry. 2002; 56: 17-18Google Scholar). All potentials are reported with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode. Films of NarB were prepared by coating freshly polished pyrolytic graphite edge (PGE) electrodes or gold electrodes coated with mercaptopropionic acid, with a submicroliter quantity of ∼40 μm enzyme containing 2 mm neomycin. Metal and Sulfide Analysis—Iron and molybdenum content in purified nitrate reductase preparations was determined by electrothermic atomic absorption spectrometry. The iron content was also determined in colorimetric assays using bipyridyl (28Eady R.R. Robson R.L. Richardson T.H. Miller R.W. Hawkins M. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 197-207Google Scholar), and acid-labile sulfide was determined as described by Rasmussen et al. (29Rasmussen T. Berks B.C. Sanders-Loehr J. Dooley D.M. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12753-12756Google Scholar). The Properties of the Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 NarB Preparations Used in the Spectropotentiometric Analyses—The Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 NarB was purified as a recombinant His6-tagged protein from E. coli strain DH5α. The protein migrated as a single 78-kDa protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1A, inset) and was the only visible band in Coomassie Blue-stained gels of the samples used for spectroscopy and protein film voltammetry. The metal and acid-labile sulfur content of the preparations (mean of three determinations) was 4:4.2:1.2 (iron/sulfur/molybdenum)/NarB. The enzyme had a kcat of 80 s–1 when assayed using reduced methylviologen as the electron donor and nitrate as the electron acceptor. The Km for nitrate was 0.05 mm yielding a kcat/Km of 1,600 s–1 mm–1. Chlorate served as an alternative substrate for which the kcat was lower than for nitrate (5 s–1) and the Km was much higher (2.5 mm), giving a kcat/Km of 2 s–1mm–1, which is 800× lower than that for nitrate. Selenate was also able to serve as an alternative substrate with a similar Km to chlorate (2.5 mm) but with a much lower kcat of ∼1 s–1 (kcat/Km = 0.4 s–1 mm–1). NarB turnover was sensitive to inhibition by azide and cyanide. Azide inhibition could be modeled for a simple competitive inhibitor with a KI of 13 mm. Cyanide was a much more potent inhibitor, but the pattern of inhibition was more complex and suggestive of mixed inhibition that could be defined by an I50 of 0.01 mm. NarB was also stimulated by chloride anions exhibiting a 2- and 4-fold increase in nitrate reductase activity in the presence of 100 and 500 mm NaCl, KCl, or NH4Cl. Spectropotentiometric Characterization of the NarB Iron-Sulfur Cluster—The UV-visible spectrum of air-oxidized NarB exhibits broad absorption shoulders at around 320, 400, and 450 nm (Fig. 1A). The features at 400–450 nm decrease in intensity on reduction with dithionite and are indicative of the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster, consistent with previous studies on this enzyme (24Rubio L.M. Flores E. Herrero A. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 72: 13-26Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum of air-oxidized NarB showed weak features in the g = 2.1 region that are characteristic of the presence of a [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster, but integration of this signal suggested that it maximally accounted for 0.05 spin/NarB (Fig. 1B, spectrum I). However, on reduction with dithionite an intense rhombic signal developed with simulated parameters of g1,2,3 = 2.058, 1.951, 1.908. Such signals are characteristic of a S = ½[2Fe-2S]1+ or [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster. However, the temperature dependence (the signal did not persist above 40 K) and the metal/sulfide ratio of approximately 4:4:1 (iron/sulfur/molybdenum) suggest that the signal arises from a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster. Spin quantification revealed that the signal accounted for ∼1 spin/NarB showing that the iron-sulfur content of the NarB could be entirely accounted for by this signal. An additional signal was observed at g ∼ 2, which also increased in intensity in the dithionite-reduced sample (Fig. 1B, spectrum II). This signal arises from Mo(V) and was studied in more detail at 60 K (see below). The addition of nitrate to reduced enzyme resulted in the disappearance of the [4Fe-4S]1+ EPR signal, showing that the cluster is acting as a functional redox center facilitating the reduction of the added nitrate (Fig. 1B, spectrum III). NarB samples were electrochemically poised at a range of potentials between 400 and –400 mV. The [4Fe-4S]1+ EPR signal developed over the potential range of 0 to –400 mV, and the titration could be fitted with a simple n = 1 Nernstian curve from which a midpoint potential of –190 mV for the [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ couple could be derived (Fig. 2). Spectropotentiometric Analysis of the NarB Molybdenum Center—The EPR spectrum collected at 60 K of air-oxidized NarB was dominated by a rhombic and highly anisotropic signal with simulation parameters as follows: g1,2,3 = 2.0228, 1.9983, 1.9930; gav = 2.0047; anisotropy (g1–g3) = 0.030; and rhombicity (g1–g2/g1–g3) = 0.82 (Fig. 3A). The signal was split by a weakly interacting I = ½ nucleus (A1,2,3 = 0.68, 0.75, 0.68 mT) that remained in spectra collected from enzyme exchanged into D2O. This signal was assigned to a Mo(V) species that is similar to a signal termed very high g and observed in Paracoccus pantotrophus periplasmic nitrate reductase (8Butler C.S. Charnock J.M. Bennett B. Sears H.J. Reilly A.J. Ferguson S.J. Garner C.D. Lowe D.J. Thomson A.J. Berks B.C. Richardson D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9000-9012Google Scholar), and this signal accounted for 10–20% of the total molybdenum in NarB, depending on the preparation (four independent preparations were examined). Reduction of the enzyme with a 20-fold excess of dithionite led to the disappearance of this signal, but a new Mo(V) signal appeared that also accounted for ∼20% of total molybdenum in the sample and that could be described by the following simulation parameters: g1,2,3 = 1.9970, 1.9902, 1.9820; gav = 1.9897; anisotropy (g1–g3) = 0.015; and rhombicity (g1–g2/g1–g3) = 0.45 (Fig. 3B). The signal was split by two weakly interacting I = ½ nuclei, one of which was only resolved in the g1 feature (A11,2,3 = 0.65, 0.60, 0.50 mT and A21 = 0.22 mT) and is similar to a signal termed high g and observed in P. pantotrophus periplasmic nitrate reductase (8Butler C.S. Charnock J.M. Bennett B. Sears H.J. Reilly A.J. Ferguson S.J. Garner C.D. Lowe D.J. Thomson A.J. Berks B.C. Richardson D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9000-9012Google Scholar). Neither Mo(V) signal was present at significant levels when the NarB preparations were equilibrated with a redox mediator mixture under anaerobic conditions at electropositive potentials (∼400 mV). As the potential was lowered to below 0 mV the high g signal began to appear and accounted for ∼1 spin/mol of NarB when fully developed in samples poised below –280 mV (Fig. 4A). No decrease in intensity was observed in samples poised at –550 mV. Addition of nitrate to such samples resulted in a decrease in intensity of the Mo(V) signal. The titration was fitted with an n = 1 Nernstian curve, from which a midpoint potential of –150 mV for the Mo6+/5+ couple was derived (Fig. 4B). The very high g signal was not seen in the anaerobic titration and was only apparent in the air-equilibrated samples.Fig. 4Variation of Synechococcus nitrate reductase Mo(V) EPR signal intensity with potential.A, selected spectra from different potentials in the titration (arrows indicate decreasing potential). The spectral parameters are g1,2,3 = 1.9970, 1.9902, 1.9820. B, plot of normalized signal intensity (measured from the trough of the g3 feature) versus potential. The data were fitted with an n = 1 Nernstian curve with Em =–150 mV. Conditions of measurement were as follows: NarB (50 μm) in 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 8.0); temperature, 60 K; microwave power, 2 milliwatts; microwave frequency, 9.68 GHz; and modulation amplitude, 0.5 mT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Protein Film Voltammetry of NarB—Films of NarB on PGE electrodes gave rise to catalytic currents for which the essential features were retained during potential cycles after the second scan, with scan rates up to 20 mV s–1 and electrode rotation rates from 1000 to 5500 rpm. No faradaic response was observed in the absence of enzyme at all nitrate concentrations investigated. Thus the voltammograms can be considered to reflect steady-state behavior of the enzyme. Analysis of the cyclic voltammogram under substrate-limited conditions (e.g. 0.01 mm NaNO3 in Fig. 5A) shows that there is no significant current (and hence electron transfer to nitrate) until the applied potential is lowered to below –250 mV. Decreasing the potential further then results in a sharp increase in current amplitude until a local maximum is reached at around –450 mV. The presence of maxima and minima in the cyclic voltammograms using both PGE electrodes and gold electrodes coated with mercaptopropionic acid cannot be due to substrate depletion because the feature is apparent on both the forward and reverse sweeps. Moreover, the local minimum is not due to product inhibition because addition of 5 mm nitrite did not enhance this feature. The amplitude of the catalytic current measured at –450 mV was dependent on nitrate concentration, and this could be fitted to a simple Michaelis-Menten description to yield a Km for nitrate of 0.08 mm. This was similar to the Km obtained in solution state assays (0.05 mm) using dithionite-reduced methylviologen as the electron donor, which provides electrons at a similar potential. This provided evidence that forming a film on the electrode surface had not structurally perturbed the active site of the enzyme. Increasing the substrate concentration to 1 mm nitrate resulted in the local maxima and minima being masked from the catalytic wave form; this was primarily due to the catalytic current at the negative potential extreme continuing to increase at nitrate concentrations where the catalytic current at more positive potentials had reached a nitrate-independent value. The Km for nitrate measured at –650 mV increased to 0.350 mm, suggesting a redox potential-dependent structural change in the catalytic site of NarB that decreases its affinity for nitrate. This work has presented the first spectropotentiometric study of a bacterial assimilatory nitrate reductase and now provides the opportunity for the first comparison of the redox properties of members from the three main subgroups of bacterial nitrate reductases, the assimilatory, periplasmic, and membrane-bound enzymes (2Richardson D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2131378971,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) plays important roles in vascular physiology and homeostasis. Whether eNOS catalyzes nitric oxide biosynthesis or the synthesis of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and peroxynitrite is dictated by the bioavailability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and l-arginine during eNOS catalysis. The effect of BH4 and l-arginine on oxygen-induced radical intermediates has been investigated by single turnover rapid-freeze quench and EPR spectroscopy using the isolated eNOS oxygenase domain (eNOSox). Three distinct radical intermediates corresponding to >50% of the heme were observed during the reaction between ferrous eNOSox and oxygen. BH4-free eNOSox produced the superoxide radical very efficiently in the absence of l-arginine. l-Arginine decreased the formation rate of superoxide by an order of magnitude but not its final level or EPR line shape. For BH4-containing eNOSox, only a stoichiometric amount of BH4 radical was produced in the presence of l-arginine, but in its absence a new radical was obtained. This new radical could be either a peroxyl radical of BH4 or an amino acid radical was in the vicinity of the heme. Formation of this new radical is very rapid, >150 s–1, and it was subsequently converted to a BH4 radical. The trapping of the superoxide radical by cytochrome c in the reaction of BH4(–) eNOSox exhibited a limiting rate of ∼15 s–1, the time for the superoxide radical to leave the heme pocket and reach the protein surface; this reveals a general problem of the regular spin-trapping method in determining radical formation kinetics. Cytochrome c failed to trap the new radical species. Together with other EPR characteristics, our data strongly support the conclusion that this new radical is not a superoxide radical or a mixture of superoxide and biopterin radicals. Our study points out distinct roles of BH4 and l-arginine in regulating eNOS radical intermediates.

Nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; B, biopterin; BH2, 7,8-dihydrobiopterin; BH4, (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin; BH4(+) eNOSox, BH4-reconstituted eNOS oxygenase domain; BH4(–) eNOSox, BH4-deficient eNOS oxygenase domain; eNOS, endothelial NOS; eNOSox, eNOS oxygenase domain; Fe(II), ferrous heme; Fe(II)O2, oxyferrous heme; Fe(III), ferric heme; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; iNOS, inducible NOS; nNOS, neuronal NOS; NO, nitric oxide; P½, power at half-saturation; SEITU, S-ethylisothiourea. which catalyzes nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis, is a complicated cytochrome P450-like enzyme. Three substrates (l-arginine, NADPH, and oxygen) and four products (NO, l-citrulline, NADP+, and water) are involved in the 5-electron oxidation of the guanidino nitrogen of l-arginine to yield NO. Four cofactors, FMN and FAD in the reductase domain and heme and BH4 in the oxygenase domain, participate in catalysis (1Feldman P.L. Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Chem. Eng. News. 1993; 51: 26-38Google Scholar, 2Raman C.S. Martásek P. Masters B.S.S. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Phorphyrin Handbook. Academic Press, New York2000: 293-339Google Scholar). The reductase domain mainly functions as the source of reducing equivalents generated after NADPH binding, and the heme center is the site of the key chemical events. A tight coupling between the reductase and oxygenase domains maximizes NO formation rather than producing side products such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and even peroxynitrite (3Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9220-9225Google Scholar, 4Xia Y. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Zweier J.L. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14533-14536Google Scholar). When NOS behaves as a superoxide synthase or peroxynitrite synthase, it may cause endothelial dysfunction, arteriosclerosis, and even vascular injury and septic shock (7Wang W. Wang S. Yan L.

Res. 1996; 78: 1051-1063Google Scholar). The two major controlling factors in achieving an optimal redox coupling are the timely supply of l-arginine and the integration of BH4 into the oxygenase domain. Superoxide radical formation in three different NOS isoforms has been studied extensively in the presence or absence of either l-arginine or BH4 mainly by spin-trapping and EPR spectroscopy (3Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9220-9225Google Scholar, 4Xia Y. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Zweier J.L. J.

It was found that autoxidation of flavin in the reductase domain dominates superoxide formation in iNOS (11Xia Y. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22635-22639Google Scholar), whereas breakdown of the Fe(II)O2 (or Fe(III)O–2) heme intermediate is the main source of superoxide in nNOS and eNOS (3Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B.

Furthermore, superoxide formation in nNOS is almost completely inhibited by l-arginine, whereas in eNOS only BH4 appears to suppress superoxide formation fully (3Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9220-9225Google Scholar, 4Xia Y. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

It is critical to understand these isozyme-specific regulatory processes of eNOS to develop strategies to intervene in NOS-derived vascular dysfunction in an isozyme-specific manner. Several experimental barriers hamper elucidation of the underlying mechanisms regarding the differential regulation of superoxide formation by l-arginine and/or BH4. First, most previous studies were carried out under steady-state conditions, which involve many complicated chemical steps from both the reductase and the oxygenase domains, and it is difficult to locate the key steps that define the kinetics of superoxide formation. Second, most of the previous studies used excess BH4 in addressing the effect of BH4 in regulating superoxide formation. The presence of free BH4 complicates data interpretation because of its side reactions. BH4 reacts with superoxide directly at a respectable rate, 105m–1 s–1 (14Vasquez-Vivar J. Whitsett J. Martasek P. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 975-985Google Scholar). This same effect was claimed to be the mechanism by which BH4 prevents NO feedback inhibition of nNOS by channeling NO to peroxynitrite formation (15Griscavage J.M. Fukuto J.M. Komori Y. Ignarro L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21644-21649Google Scholar). Thus, excess BH4 could change the overall steady-state kinetics of NO production. In addition, autoxidation of free BH4 could itself be a source of superoxide, thus causing overestimation of the NOS-derived superoxide. Third, the commonly used spin-trapping EPR measurement for superoxide radical is an indirect determination for superoxide. The rate-limiting radical capturing of spin-trap masks the true rate of superoxide formation, and the trapping efficiency also leads to underestimation of the total amount of superoxide radical (16Janzen E.G. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 188-198Google Scholar). To achieve an unambiguous resolution of the regulatory mechanisms of l-arginine and/or BH4 on superoxide formation, we decided to take direct approaches. We focused on the eNOS oxygenase domain and examined the fate of the Fe(II)O2 heme complex by optical and EPR spectroscopy under single turnover conditions. We thus exclude possible superoxide formation from flavin oxidation. Rapid-freeze trapping/EPR measurement was used to replace spin-trapping to obtain direct structural and kinetic data for superoxide and other radical intermediates (17Palmer G. Bray R.C. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2657-2666Google Scholar). More reliable quantification for the amount of radical intermediate(s) was accomplished without the complication of trapping efficiency encountered in spin-trapping and the secondary degradation of spin adduct (16Janzen E.G. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 188-198Google Scholar). Only NOS-bound BH4 was evaluated, thus eliminating potential side reactions. In this study, we provide the first direct structural as well as kinetic information for a superoxide, a BH4, and a new radical intermediate occurring during the reaction between ferrous eNOSox and oxygen. This work convincingly shows that BH4 is the factor that dictates the radical structure, whereas l-arginine, on the other hand, has no effect on the radical structure but exhibits substantial influence on the radical kinetics. Our data also substantiate the functional role of BH4 in minimizing the formation of oxygen active species under uncoupled condition of eNOS. Materials—BH4, BH2, and 5-methyl BH4 were obtained from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Horse heart cytochrome c (type III), bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase, grade I, was purchased from Roche Applied Science. SEITU was the product of Alexis, San Diego. Expression and Purification of Human eNOS Oxygenase Domain (eNOSox)—Recombinant human eNOSox was prepared using a yeast expression system as described previously (18Du M. Yeh H.C. Berka V. Wang L.H. Tsai A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6002-6011Google Scholar). The biopterin content of the purified eNOSox from yeast expression was less than 0.2/subunit, mainly present as BH2. All eNOS preparations were stored at liquid nitrogen temperature in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.15 m NaCl. BH4(+) eNOSox or BH2(+) eNOSox was prepared by an anaerobic reconstitution process as we described earlier (18Du M. Yeh H.C. Berka V. Wang L.H. Tsai A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6002-6011Google Scholar). Excess BH4 or BH2 was removed by gel filtration, and the reconstituted protein was then concentrated and stored at liquid nitrogen temperature before use. Biopterin Determination—Total biopterin content of purified eNOS was measured using the procedure described previously (20Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1119-1129Google Scholar). Quantitation of individual biopterin redox species in eNOSox was conducted by a combination of chemical quench and HPLC as described recently. 2V. Berka, H.-C. Yeh, D. Gao, F. Kiran, and A.-L. Tsai, submitted for publication. Quantitation of Superoxide—eNOSox-released superoxide was determined by the cytochrome c trapping reaction using a difference absorbance coefficient of 21 mm–1 cm–1 at 550 nm (29Kuthan H. Ullrich V. Estabrook R.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 551-558Google Scholar). Stopped-flow Experiments—Kinetics of the reaction between Fe(II) eNOSox and oxygen was determined using an Applied Photophysics model SX-18MV stopped-flow instrument with a rapid scan diode array accessory (21Berka V. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9373-9383Google Scholar). The fluid channels were incubated with dithionite solution for several hours and then washed with nitrogen-saturated buffer before sample loading. Reactants were rendered anaerobic by repeated vacuum/argon cycles in a tonometer. The reaction time courses were analyzed by nonlinear regression to single or multiple exponential functions. Biopterin Radical Formation Kinetics in eNOSox—The procedure was essentially the same as that published recently (18Du M. Yeh H.C. Berka V. Wang L.H. Tsai A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6002-6011Google Scholar). Ferrous eNOSox prepared by anaerobic stoichiometric titration with dithionite was reacted with oxygenated buffer or oxidized cytochrome c. Samples at different reaction time points were collected for EPR analysis by the rapid-freeze technique using an Update Instrument (Madison, WI) System 1000 rapid-freeze apparatus placed inside an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory). Reaction mixtures were sprayed through a 0.008-inch diameter nozzle into –140 °C isopentane and collected into EPR tubes with a custom-built pressure-packing device (22Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Kulmacz R.J. Wu G. Palmer G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 165-171Google Scholar). Spectrometry—UV-visible spectra were recorded with a HP8453 diode array spectrophotometer with 1-nm spectral band width. EPR spectra were recorded at liquid helium or liquid nitrogen temperatures on a Bruker EMX spectrometer (18Du M. Yeh H.C. Berka V. Wang L.H. Tsai A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6002-6011Google Scholar). Unless specified otherwise, the conditions for liquid nitrogen EPR measurements were: microwave power, 2 mW; frequency, 9.29 GHz; modulation amplitude, 2 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; and time constant, 0.33 s. Liquid helium EPR conditions used for heme structure determination were the same, except for microwave power, 1 mW; frequency, 9.61 GHz; and modulation amplitude, 10 G. The microwave power dependence was analyzed by nonlinear regression to the equation log(S/P1/2)=−b/2log(P1/2+P)+b/2log(P1/2)+logK (Eq. 1) where P is the power, S is the peak to trough amplitude of the EPR signal, P½ is the power at half-saturation, and b and K are floating parameters (23Hales B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 384-395Google Scholar). Three Radical Species Induced by Oxygen in Ferrous eNOSox—A single turnover reaction between ferrous eNOSox and oxygen was conducted in the presence or absence of BH4 and/or l-arginine. EPR examination of the radical intermediates trapped by rapid-freeze quench revealed three distinct species (Fig. 1). In the absence of both BH4 and l-arginine, a radical with axial symmetry was induced by oxygen (Figs. 1B and 2c). The EPR spectrum of this radical had gz = 2.077 and gx,y = 2.007 (at zero crossover); it exhibited homogeneous microwave power dependence. The very high P½ of ∼50 mW at 115 K (Fig. 1B, inset) and the EPR line shape were typical of the isolated superoxide radical (24Bennett J.E. Mile B. Thomas A. Trans. Farad. Soc. 1968; 64: 3200-3209Google Scholar, 25Knowles P.F. Gibson J.F. Pick F.M. Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1969; 111: 53-58Google Scholar). The same radical species was also observed when l-arginine was included (Fig. 3f).Fig. 2EPR spectra of oxygen-induced radical intermediates in eNOSox and their arithmetic treatments. EPR spectra recorded at 2 mW and 115 K for the oxygen-induced radicals in 40 μm BH4(+) eNOS plus 0.2 mm l-arginine (a), BH4(+) eNOS (b), and BH4(–) eNOS (c) are shown. Spectrum d was obtained by subtracting proportions of a from b to removal maximally the wing bands signals at g = 1.99 and 2.023. Spectrum e was obtained by removing maximally the g = 2.040 broad feature by subtracting portions of spectrum c from b.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3EPR spectra of oxygen-induced superoxide radical of eNOSox in the presence/absence of BH4, BH2, l-arginine, or SEITU. Control EPR spectra were obtained for the reaction of anaerobic ferric l-arginine-free BH4(+) eNOS versus aerobic buffer (a) and l-arginine-free ferrous BH4(+) eNOS versus anaerobic buffer (b). Spectra c–g are reactions of ferrous eNOSoxversus oxygenated buffer: c, BH2(+) eNOSox + 0.4 m m l-arginine; d, BH4(+) eNOSox + 0.2 mm SEITU; e, BH4(–) eNOSox + 0.2 mm SEITU; f, BH4(–) eNOSox + 0.4 mm; l-arginine; g, l-arginine-free BH2(+) eNOSoxh, l-arginine-free 5-methyl-BH4(+) eNOSox.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the presence of BH4, the freeze trapped radical species showed a distinctly different EPR line shape (Fig. 1, A and C). With both BH4 and l-arginine present, a 40 G wide symmetric spectrum centered at 2.0023 (Figs. 1A and 2a) was trapped and has been documented as a BH4-derived cation or neutral radical (18Du M. Yeh H.C. Berka V. Wang L.H. Tsai A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6002-6011Google Scholar, 26Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Google Scholar, 27Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Google Scholar, 28Schmidt P.P. Lange R. Gorren A.C. Werner E.R. Mayer B Andersson K.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 151-158Google Scholar). This radical also showed homogeneous power dependence with a P½ of ∼14 mW (Fig. 1A, inset). In contrast, a previously unidentified radical species was trapped in the presence of BH4 when l-arginine was omitted (Figs. 1C and 2b). This radical exhibited a small broad peak at g = 2.040 and a dominant symmetric feature centered at 2.0048. This dominant feature was more symmetric than the g = 2.007 perpendicular component of the superoxide radical but with a broader line width, 20 G, and clear satellites at g = 1.99 and 2.023. The microwave power dependence was heterogeneous with the center peak-to-trough showing a P½ of 4.7 mW and the g = 1.99 feature a P½ of 14.7 mW (Fig. 1C, inset). Suspecting that the new radical species shown in Fig. 1C might be a mixture of the superoxide and BH4 radicals, we attempted to reproduce this third species by linear combinations of the superoxide and BH4 radicals. Spectra a–c in Fig. 2 are the individual radical EPR spectra of the BH4 radical, the new radical species, and superoxide, respectively, acquired at 1 mW and 115 K. Spectrum d was obtained by subtracting a from b and spectrum e by subtracting c from b; the amounts of a and c were adjusted to produce the most plausible resultant spectra. Spectrum d has nominal g values of 2.0023 and 2.045, with the 2.0023 signal significantly more symmetric than that of the superoxide radical. Spectrum e is an isotropic species centered at g = 2.0023 with a width of ∼47 G between the two shoulders and a 19 G peak-to-trough width at the center. Spectrum d does not resemble c, nor does e resemble a. Thus, the new radical species does not appear to be a mixture of superoxide and BH4 radical. Generation of these three radical species was oxygen-dependent because there was no radical formation when ferrous eNOSox was mixed with anaerobic buffer (Fig. 3a). Only the ferrous form of eNOSox was capable of radical formation because anaerobic ferric eNOSox failed to produce radical upon mixing with oxygen (Fig. 3b). The redox state of biopterin showed a decisive effect on the oxygen-induced radical species. BH2-reconstituted eNOSox failed to generate either the biopterin radical or the new radical when reacted with oxygen. The only radical species observed was superoxide (Fig. 3, c and g). Further addition of l-arginine decreased the maximal radical level by more than 80%, from 0.5 to 0.1 spin/heme. Replacing l-arginine with SEITU, a competitive inhibitor of l-arginine, also led only to superoxide radical formation (Fig. 3, d and e). eNOSox with bound BH4 substantially decreased the amount of superoxide radical formation from 0.3 to 0.06 spin/heme. The new radical species observed in the presence of BH4 and absence of l-arginine (Fig. 1C or 2b) is BH4-specific because replacement by either BH2 or 5-methyl BH4 yielded only superoxide radical (Fig. 3h). Kinetic Relationship between Heme Redox Changes and Radical Formation—The kinetics of heme oxidation, followed in the optical stopped-flow, was compared with the kinetics of radical production, followed by rapid-freeze EPR, at relatively high enzyme concentrations (30–40 μm) to obtain reliable quantitative data for the radicals. We first describe the results of BH4(–) eNOSox. The absorbance changes at 400 nm upon mixing ferrous eNOSox with oxygen were very different in the presence and absence of l-arginine (Fig. 4A). In the absence of l-arginine, there was a biphasic increase that could be fit by a double-exponential function of approximately equal amplitudes and rate constants of 150 and 3.6 s–1. In the presence of 200 μm l-arginine, there was an initial decrease at 207 s–1 followed by an increase at 3 s–1. Similar biphasic kinetics were also observed for the rapid-scan and single-wavelength kinetic measurements at lower enzyme concentrations (∼5 μm) (data not shown). However, in the absence of l-arginine the fast phase contributed only 5–10% to the overall absorbance changes at 400 nm. 3V. Berka and A.-L. Tsai, unpublished results. The observed biphasic increase at 400 nm at high enzyme concentrations (Fig. 4A) in the absence of l-arginine indicates both fast and slow phases during the oxidation of ferrous heme to the ferric heme. In contrast, with l-arginine present, the Fe(II)O2 intermediate was stable as an optical intermediate, thus leading to the bimodal changes at 400 nm in opposite directions, indicating a reaction sequence as in Reaction 1. Fe(II)↔Fe(II)O2→Fe(III) Reaction 1 The parallel rapid-freeze quench data without l-arginine showed an initial burst of superoxide radical which is maintained at the level of ∼0.5 spin/heme for ∼300 ms and then slowly decays at a rate of ∼2 s–1 (Fig. 4C). This initial burst of radical signal is compatible with the 150 s–1 phase in the optical data after taking into account the 7-ms dead time of our rapid-freeze system (22Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Kulmacz R.J. Wu G. Palmer G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 165-171Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, the superoxide radical kinetic data showed a much slower rate in the presence of l-arginine (16 s–1) but also leveled off at about 0.5 spin/heme (Fig. 4C). The radical signal subsequently decayed at a rate, 1.8 s–1, similar to that in the absence of l-arginine. In the reaction containing l-arginine, the radical formation rate appeared to be faster than the positive phase of the bimodal kinetics in the stopped-flow data, 14.5 versus 2.4 s–1 (Fig. 4, A versus C, and Table I). The amplitude change of the corresponding heme EPR signal at g = 7 was also quantified for its time-dependent amplitude changes in the same set of rapid-freeze samples and showed a rate constant of 5.1 s–1, closer but still somewhat slower than the rate of superoxide radical formation.Table IEPR characteristics and kinetics parameters for three different radical intermediates induced by oxygen in eNOSoxConditionsRadical species[Spin]P½Fe2+-O2 → Fe3+RadicalFormationDecay+ Cyt c3+%mWs-1s-1s-1s-1+BH4 + l-ArgBH4˙+90 ± 7a[spin] / [BH4].13.8 ± 115.4 ± 1.713.1 ± 2.7cBased on g = 2 signal at 11 K.2NDdND, not done.10.9 ± 1.5bDetermined by g = 7 signal at 11 K.+BH4 - l-ArgNew63 ± 11a[spin] / [BH4].4.0 ± 1.5166 ± 42eDouble exponential fit.FastNDFastRadical13.2 ± 0.4eDouble exponential fit.≥166≥166-BH4 - l-ArgO2·¯42 ± 13f[spin] / [heme].54 ± 3164 ± 24eDouble exponential fit.FastNDDecay3.9 ± 0.7eDouble exponential fit.≥16414.5 ± 5-BH4 + l-ArgO2·¯47 ± 10f[spin] / [heme].51 ± 22.4 ± 0.914.5 ± 7.8cBased on g = 2 signal at 11 K.1.8∼05.1 ± 0.5bDetermined by g = 7 signal at 11 K.a [spin] / [BH4].b Determined by g = 7 signal at 11 K.c Based on g = 2 signal at 11 K.d ND, not done.e Double exponential fit.f [spin] / [heme]. Open table in a new tab To explore further the identity of the radical intermediate, we included cytochrome c and/or superoxide dismutase in the oxygenated buffer in the comparative kinetic measurements. We monitored cytochrome c reduction at 550 nm as an index of its reaction with superoxide radical (29Kuthan H. Ullrich V. Estabrook R.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 551-558Google Scholar). In the absence of l-arginine and cytochrome c, there was a biphasic decrease at A550, and the rates and contributions of each phase matched the changes at 400 nm (Fig. 4, A versus B), indicating that these changes originated from eNOS heme. When 100 μm cytochrome c was included, we observed a single exponential increase at A550 with a rate constant of 10 s–1. The total change at 550 nm corresponded to ∼10 μm reducing equivalents, or the trapping of 10 μm superoxide radical (Fig. 4B). This value agreed with the production of superoxide to a maximum level of 0.5 spin/heme measured by rapid-freeze quench EPR (Fig. 4C). Further, inclusion of superoxide dismutase in the oxygenated buffer substantially reduced the absorbance change at 550 nm, confirming that superoxide radical provided the reducing equivalents to cytochrome c. Parallel rapid-freeze EPR experiments containing 200 μm cytochrome c yielded a kinetic decay from ∼0.45 spin/heme down to <0.05 spin/heme superoxide radical at a rate of 14.5 s–1 (Fig. 4C). Further increasing the concentration of cytochrome c did not accelerate the superoxide radical decay rate. This rate is thus the dead time required for cytochrome c to trap superoxide released from eNOSox. In the presence of l-arginine, cytochrome c more effectively trapped the superoxide radical because of the slow rate of generation of superoxide. In this case, only a small amount of superoxide radical was observed even at the earliest time point of freeze quench (∼7 ms) (Fig. 4C). A similar set of stopped-flow kinetic data (Fig. 4B) was also obtained for the reactions containing l-arginine (not shown) but the rate of cytochrome c reduction was 4 s–1. This value is lower than that obtained in the absence of l-arginine, 10 s–1, possibly because of a limit by the slow radical formation, 14.5 s–1. In the case of BH4(+) eNOSox the stopped-flow kinetics at 400 nm were similar to those for BH4(–) eNOSox, but the rate for the second phase was increased several fold (Fig. 5A). Without l-arginine, the absorbance at 400 nm showed a biphasic increase with rate constants of 166 and 13 s–1 with contributions in total amplitude of 55 and 45%, respectively. The rapid-freeze quench of this sample trapped the new radical species (Figs. 1C and 2b). The radical formation showed an initial burst to the level of 0.54–0.61 spin/BH4 and lasted for ∼500 ms before decaying at 2 s–1 (Fig. 5B). There was a gradual time-dependent change in EPR line shape of the radical intermediate from that shown in Fig. 1C to an EPR line shape typical of the BH4 radical after a few seconds of reaction with oxygen (data not shown). The microwave power dependence determined for the sample trapped at an early stage of the reaction was P½ = 5 mW, different from th"
https://openalex.org/W2118449713,"Insulin stimulates glucose uptake into muscle and fat cells by translocating glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the cell surface, with input from phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and its downstream effector Akt/protein kinase B. Whether PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) suffices to produce GLUT4 translocation is unknown. We used two strategies to deliver PI(3,4,5)P3 intracellularly and two insulin-sensitive cell lines to examine Akt activation and GLUT4 translocation. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the acetoxymethyl ester of PI(3,4,5)P3 caused GLUT4 migration to the cell periphery and increased the amount of plasma membrane-associated phospho-Akt and GLUT4. Intracellular delivery of PI(3,4,5)P3 using polyamine carriers also induced translocation of myc-tagged GLUT4 to the surface of intact L6 myoblasts, demonstrating membrane insertion of the transporter. GLUT4 translocation caused by carrier-delivered PI(3,4,5)P3 was not reproduced by carrier-PI 4,5-bisphosphate or carrier alone. Like insulin, carrier-mediated delivery of PI(3,4,5)P3 elicited redistribution of perinuclear GLUT4 and Akt phosphorylation at the cell periphery. In contrast to its effect on GLUT4 mobilization, delivered PI(3,4,5)P3 did not increase 2-deoxyglucose uptake in either L6GLUT4myc myoblasts or 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The ability of exogenously delivered PI(3,4,5)P3 to augment plasma membrane GLUT4 content without increasing glucose uptake suggests that input at the level of PI 3-kinase suffices for GLUT4 translocation but is insufficient to stimulate glucose transport. Insulin stimulates glucose uptake into muscle and fat cells by translocating glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the cell surface, with input from phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and its downstream effector Akt/protein kinase B. Whether PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) suffices to produce GLUT4 translocation is unknown. We used two strategies to deliver PI(3,4,5)P3 intracellularly and two insulin-sensitive cell lines to examine Akt activation and GLUT4 translocation. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the acetoxymethyl ester of PI(3,4,5)P3 caused GLUT4 migration to the cell periphery and increased the amount of plasma membrane-associated phospho-Akt and GLUT4. Intracellular delivery of PI(3,4,5)P3 using polyamine carriers also induced translocation of myc-tagged GLUT4 to the surface of intact L6 myoblasts, demonstrating membrane insertion of the transporter. GLUT4 translocation caused by carrier-delivered PI(3,4,5)P3 was not reproduced by carrier-PI 4,5-bisphosphate or carrier alone.

In contrast to its effect on GLUT4 mobilization, delivered PI(3,4,5)P3 did not increase 2-deoxyglucose uptake in either L6GLUT4myc myoblasts or 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The ability of exogenously delivered PI(3,4,5)P3 to augment plasma membrane GLUT4 content without increasing glucose uptake suggests that input at the level of PI 3-kinase suffices for GLUT4 translocation but is insufficient to stimulate glucose transport. Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding the intracellular signaling and traffic mechanisms regulating insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (1Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin.

Scand. 2003; 178: 297-308Google Scholar). However, the precise signals linking the occupied insulin receptor to the gain in active glucose transporters (GLUT4 isoform) on the surface of muscle and fat cells are still incompletely mapped (2Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Google Scholar). GLUT4 cycles continuously to and from the plasma membrane, and at steady state, the majority of GLUT4 resides in intracellular compartments (4Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol.

The enzyme phosphorylates the 3′-OH position of the inositol ring to generate the lipid products PI 3-phosphate, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3in vitro (19Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Google Scholar). The main lipid produced in vivo in response to insulin stimulation is PI(3,4,5)P3 (13Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 677-683Google Scholar, 13Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Google Scholar, 20Tsakiridis T.

However, it is not known whether the elevation in PI 3-kinase products, specifically PI(3,4,5)P3, suffices to cause GLUT4 translocation or whether GLUT4 translocation suffices to increase glucose uptake. Stimuli such as interleukin 4 and clustering of integrin β1 fail to increase glucose uptake even though they augment PI(3,4,5)P3 levels (29Isakoff S.J. Taha C. Rose E. Marcusohn J. Klip A. Skolnik E.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10247-10251Google Scholar, 30Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33119-33122Google Scholar). We have shown previously that delivery of the acetoxymethyl (AM) ester of PI(3,4,5)P3 to 3T3-L1 adipocytes to increase intracellular levels of this lipid product of PI 3-kinase did not increase glucose uptake, although it could partially rescue the inhibitory action of wortmannin on stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin (31Jiang T. Sweeney G. Rudolf M.T. Klip A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11017-11024Google Scholar). However, the effect of PI(3,4,5)P3-AM on GLUT4 localization and Akt activation was not analyzed. Here we demonstrate that PI(3,4,5)P3-AM causes Akt phosphorylation and distribution of GLUT4 to the periphery of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, using an additional strategy developed by Ozaki et al. (32Ozaki S. DeWald D.B. Shope J.C. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11286-11291Google Scholar) to deliver PI(3,4,5)P3 into cells we examine the cell surface exposure of myc-tagged GLUT4 in L6 muscle cells. We find that carrier-mediated delivery of PI(3,4,5)P3 causes Akt activation as well as translocation and incorporation of GLUT4myc into the plasma membrane of L6 myoblasts. Yet, again, this increase in the GLUT4myc content at the cell surface was not accompanied by an increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake. We propose that PI(3,4,5)P3 suffices to elicit translocation and insertion of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane. Because such action is insufficient to mimic the insulin-dependent gain in glucose uptake, we propose that input(s) additional to PI(3,4,5)P3 are required for the culmination of increased transport of glucose into muscle and fat cells through the translocated transporters. Materials—Di-C12-PI(3,4,5)P3-AM was synthesized as described previously (31Jiang T. Sweeney G. Rudolf M.T. Klip A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11017-11024Google Scholar). All phosphoinositides, as well as the nitrobenzoxadiazoyl (NBD)-labeled or BodipyTMR (Bodipy)-conjugated versions of PI(3,4,5)P3, carrier (neomycin), and anti-PI(3,4,5)P3 mouse IgG were from Echelon Biosciences (Salt Lake City, UT). BCECF-AM (31Jiang T. Sweeney G. Rudolf M.T. Klip A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11017-11024Google Scholar) and BAPTA-AM were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Human insulin (Humulin) was obtained from Eli Lilly Canada, Inc. (Toronto, ON). Polyclonal anti-GLUT4 and monoclonal anti-GLUT4 serum (1F8) were from Biogenesis Inc. (Sandown, NH). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and Cy3-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was from Molecular Probes. Polyclonal antibodies to Akt2 and Akt3, and Akt substrate peptide (Crosstide) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal antibody to Akt1 (D17) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). [γ32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-pS473Akt antibody was from Cell Signaling (Mississauga, ON). 2-Deoxy-d-[3H]glucose was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. o-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride reagent was from Sigma. All electrophoresis and immunoblotting reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade. All cell culture solutions and supplements were obtained from Invitrogen. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 fibroblasts (a kind gift from Dr. G. Holman, University of Bath, UK) were grown in a monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% calf serum and 1% antibiotic solution (10,000 units/ml penicillin and 10 mg/ml streptomycin) in an atmosphere of 9% CO2 at 37 °C. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (33Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Google Scholar). L6 muscle cells stably overexpressing GLUT4 tagged with a myc epitope at the first exofacial loop (L6GLUT4myc) were grown as described previously (15Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in myoblast monolayers or in detached, rounded-up myoblasts as described by Foster et al. (34Foster L.J. Li D. Randhawa V.K. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44212-44221Google Scholar). PI(3,4,5)P3-AM Loading and Carrier-mediated PI(3,4,5)P3 Delivery— For treatment with PI(3,4,5)P3-AM, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum starved for 2 h followed by incubation with medium containing PI(3,4,5)P3-AM added from a stock made in dimethyl sulfoxide. The final concentration of PI(3,4,5)P3-AM was 150 μm, and control cells were treated with the corresponding concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide (0.12%). Carrier-mediated delivery of PI(3,4,5)P3 was performed as follows: A 1 mm stock solution of phosphoinositides and 1 mm carrier (neomycin) was prepared in HEPES-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na-HEPES, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Phosphoinositides and carrier were mixed (10 μm each) with serum-free α-minimum Eagle's medium in glass test tubes, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, followed by bath sonication (10 s at 35% maximum intensity, Sonic Dismembrator, model 300, Fisher). Phosphoinositides and carrier-containing medium were then applied to the cells for the indicated time period. Seven different lots of dipalmitoyl PI(3,4,5)P3 were used for the various assays described in this study using carrier-mediated phosphoinositides delivery. Lot numbers CF-1-178, CF-II-47, CF-41-138, CF-41-162, and CF-66-107 reproducibly elicited most or all of the different biological effects that they were tested for. The biological activity of CF-41-138 was confirmed in two independent laboratories (at York University and at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON). Two other lots, CF-II-29 and CSB-30-162, showed no biological effect in any of the cell-based assays tested and were not included in the results presented in this study. NMR analysis of these two lots confirmed that they were chemically equivalent to the active lots, and the disparity is likely the result of hydrolysis of esters or phosphoesters during shipment and storage. Fluorescent Detection of Fluorophore-conjugated PI(3,4,5)P3 and Indirect Immunofluorescent Detection of PI(3,4,5)P3—For fluorescent detection of PI(3,4,5)P3, NBD-PI(3,4,5)P3 or Bodipy-PI(3,4,5)P3 were incubated with carrier and applied to detached rounded-up L6GLUT4myc myoblasts (see details below) or 3T3-L1 adipocytes grown on glass coverslips, respectively. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and fixed for 30 min with 3% paraformaldehyde. Excess fixative was quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl, and coverslips were mounted using Dako mounting medium. For indirect immunofluorescent detection of PI(3,4,5)P3, cells were treated with carrier only or with PI(3,4,5)P3 as described above, fixed, and quenched as detailed above. Cells were then permeabilized using 0.2% saponin in PBS for 3 min at room temperature, followed by 10-min blocking with 5% goat serum in PBS and incubation for 1 h at room temperature with anti-PI(3,4,5)P3 mouse IgG. Coverslips were washed three times and reacted further with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. Images were obtained using a Zeiss Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope 510 (Thornwood, NY). Background nonspecific fluorescence was determined by the same protocol in the absence of primary antibody. GLUT4 Localization in Permeabilized 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Pretreated with PI(3,4,5)P3-AM—Determination of GLUT4 distribution by immunofluorescence was performed after fixing and permeabilizing the cells. Briefly, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were trypsinized and replated at a lower density on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. The cells were allowed to settle for 24 h and then serum starved for 3 h prior to treatment for 15 min with either 100 nm insulin or 150 μm PI(3,4,5)P3-AM. Coverslips holding the cells were then immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C. Excess paraformaldehyde was reacted with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min and blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS for 30 min. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the GLUT4 C terminus (35Sargeant R. Mitsumoto Y. Sarabia V. Shillabeer G. Klip A. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1993; 16: 147-162Google Scholar) were used at a dilution of 1:250 to label GLUT4 within the cells, and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were used to label the primary antibodies. Fluorescence was detected using a Zeiss Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope 510. Immunofluorescent Detection of GLUT4, Akt/PKB, and p-S473Akt in Plasma Membrane Lawns from Adipocytes Pretreated with PI(3,4,5)P3-AM—Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes grown on glass coverslips were serum deprived for 2 h. Cells were then treated for 20 min with 100 nm insulin or 150 μm PI(3,4,5)P3-AM. Control experiments were also performed using palmitate, BCECF-AM, BAPTA-AM, and PI (150 μm, 20 min). Plasma membrane lawns (sheets) were prepared as described previously (33Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Google Scholar, 36Volchuk A. Narine S. Foster L.J. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8169-8176Google Scholar) with slight modifications. After the various treatments, cells were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Hypotonic swelling buffer (23 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) was added in three quick rinses. Four ml of breaking buffer (70 mm KCl, 30 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm microcystin, pH 7.5) were added to each well, and the solution was aspirated up and down using a 1.0-ml pipetter to promote cell breakage. The coverslips were washed twice in breaking buffer and incubated with cold 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min on ice followed by three washes in PBS. Excess fixative was quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl and PBS for 5 min followed by three washes with PBS at room temperature. The lawns were subsequently blocked by a 1-h incubation in 5% goat serum in PBS at room temperature, then incubated for 60 min with antibodies (1:250 dilution of anti-GLUT4, 1:150 dilution of anti-Akt, 1:250 of anti-pS473Akt) at room temperature and washed three times in PBS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Cy3-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies (1: 250) were added for 45 min then rinsed with four washes with PBS. Coverslips were mounted with Dako mounting solution. Images were obtained using a Leica DM1RB inverted fluorescent microscope with a 40× objective. All images were collected under identical gain settings. Images were analyzed using ImageJ software by comparing pixel intensities of lawns and their respective backgrounds among the various conditions tested in each experiment. Akt Activity in 3T3-L1 Adipocyte Lysates Treated with PI(3,4,5)P3-AM—3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated for 30 min with 100 nm insulin or 150 μm PI(3,4,5)P3-AM, lysed, and the in vitro kinase activities of Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 were determined as described previously (33Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on 6-well plates were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 30 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm Na3VO4,1mm dithiothreitol, and 100 nm okadaic acid. Antibody (2 μg/condition) precoupled to protein A-/protein G-Sepharose beads (20 μl of 100 mg/ml each/condition) was added to 250 μg of total protein from cell lysates. Antibody-coupled beads were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and once with ice-cold lysis buffer before use. The indicated enzymes were immunoprecipitated by incubating with the antibody-bead complex for 2–3 h under constant rotation at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were isolated and washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin, and 100 nm okadaic acid) and twice with 1 ml of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 nm okadaic acid, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The complexes were then incubated under constant agitation for 30 min at 30 °C with 30 μl of reaction mixture (kinase buffer containing 5 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ32P]ATP plus 100 μm Crosstide as substrate in Akt assays). After the reaction, 30 μl of the supernatant was transferred onto Whatman p81 filter paper and washed four times for 10 min with 3 ml of 175 mm phosphoric acid and once with distilled water for 5 min. Filters were air dried and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Immunofluorescent Detection of GLUT4myc in Intact, Rounded-up Myoblasts upon Carrier-mediated Delivery of PI(3,4,5)P3—Rounded-up myoblasts were used to detect surface GLUT4myc as described previously (34Foster L.J. Li D. Randhawa V.K. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44212-44221Google Scholar). Briefly, quiescent L6 myoblasts were detached from their substratum by incubation in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS for 10 min. Dislodged cells were suspended in HEPES-buffered RPMI and allowed to begin reattaching onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips for 10 min. These rounded-up cells were then treated for 10 min with 100 nm insulin or PI(3,4,5)P3 plus carrier, each 10 μm unless otherwise stated, for 10 min, as described above. After rinsing with PBS, coverslips with rounded-up myoblasts were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 min, and then excess paraformaldehyde was reacted with 0.1 m glycine for 10 min. Cells were then incubated at 4 °C with 5% goat serum in PBS for 15 min. Monoclonal antibody against the myc epitope (1:150) was then added for 1 h to label surface GLUT4myc followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200) for 50 min. Cells were postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and excess paraformaldehyde was reacted with 0.1 m glycine for 10 min. Coverslips were mounted on slides using Dako antifade solution, and fluorescence was detected using a Zeiss Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope 510. Akt Phosphorylation in L6 Myoblasts upon Carrier-mediated Delivery of PI(3,4,5)P3—L6 myoblasts grown on coverslips were treated with insulin or PI(3,4,5)P3 plus carrier as described above, washed three times with cold PBS supplemented by 100 nm okadaic acid and 1 mm Na3VO4, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS supplemented with the phosphatase inhibitors for 30 min, after which excess paraformaldehyde was quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Immunohistochemistry-compatible anti-pS473Akt antibody (Cell Signaling) (1:250) was prepared in blocking solution and applied to the coverslips for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, fluorophore-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was used to detect pAkt immunoreactivity. Z-stack images were acquired using laser confocal images, collapsed into a single image, and analyzed as described below for intracellular GLUT4myc. Quantification of Cell Surface GLUT4myc in L6 Myoblast Monolayers upon Carrier-mediated Delivery of PI(3,4,5)P3—Quantification of GLUT4myc at the surface of adhered myoblasts was performed as described previously with slight modifications (37Wang Q. Khayat Z. Kishi K. Ebina Y. Klip A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 193-197Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment of quiescent L6GLUT4myc myoblasts with or without 100 nm insulin or PI(3,4,5)P3 plus carrier (10 μm each) at 37 °C as indicated, cells in 24-well tissue culture plates were placed on ice and rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS for 15 min, and then reacted at 4 °C for 1 h with either a monoclonal anti-myc antibody (kind gift from Dr. M. Moran, University of Toronto, Canada, 8 μg/ml in HEPES-modified RPMI containing 3% goat serum), or a commercial anti-myc antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz, 1:100 in 5% goat serum in PBS). After four washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were fixed with 3% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 10 min followed by quenching with 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 10 min and incubation with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, 1:1,000 in PBS containing 3% goat serum) at 4 °C for 1 h. The cell monolayers were then washed six times with PBS, then 1 ml/well of 0.4 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride reagent (horseradish peroxidase substrate) was added at room temperature for 20–30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.25 ml of 3 n HCl, and the A492 nm was measured. Control wells remained untreated with either primary antibody or both primary and secondary antibodies. Measurements of surface GLUT4myc in control wells were subtracted from values in all other treatments. Immunofluorescent Detection of Perinuclear GLUT4myc in Adhered L6 Myoblasts upon Carrier-mediated Delivery of PI(3,4,5)P3—L6 myoblasts grown on glass coverslips were exposed to the different treatments (insulin, PI(3,4,5)P3 plus carrier, or carrier alone) and then fixed and permeabilized to detect intracellular GLUT4myc by immunofluorescence (38Randhawa V.K. Bilan P.J. Khayat Z.A. Daneman N. Liu Z. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Peng X.R. Coppola T. Regazzi R. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2403-2417Google Scholar). Images at a magnification of ×100 using a Zeiss Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope 510 were acquired from several fields of view from at least three separate experiments. To obtain an integrated image of total intracellular protein with minimal contribution of the surface signal, the whole cell was scanned along the z axis by optical slicing 0.4 μm apart. A single composite image (collapsed XY projection) of the optical cuts in which the outline of the nucleus was discernible was generated using LSM 5 Image software (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) and used for subsequent analyses. For this study, the “cone” morphology was defined as a characteristic polarized clustering of GLUT4myc around the nucleus, which spans less than two-thirds of the nuclear perimeter and exhibits a peak-like distribution. In contrast, the “crown” morphology was defined by a distinctly uniform, tight ring of GLUT4myc about the nuclear perimeter. The number of cells exhibiting these morphologies is expressed as percent of the total number of cells analyzed. Determination of 2-Deoxyglucose upon Carrier-mediated Delivery of PI(3,4,5)P3—2-Deoxyglucose uptake was measured as described previously (39Rudich A. Konrad D. Torok D. Ben-Romano R. Huang C. Niu W. Garg R.R. Wijesekara N. Germinario R.J. Bilan P.J. Klip A. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 649-658Google Scholar). Briefly, L6 myoblast monolayers or 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum deprived for 4 h and exposed to insulin, carrier alone or PI(3,4,5)P3 plus carrier, as indicated. The monolayers were washed twice with HEPES-buffered saline, and any remaining liquid was aspirated. Cells were then incubated for 5 min in HEPES-buffered saline containing 10 μm unlabeled 2-deoxyglucose and 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (0.5 μCi/ml). The radioactivity was then aspirated and the cells washed three times in ice-cold saline solution. In some experiments, the wash solution contained 2 mm HgCl2 to ensure blockade of any possible efflux of free 2-deoxyglucose during the wash. This addition did not change the results, suggesting that there was no free he"
https://openalex.org/W2069421104,"ARH is an adaptor protein required for efficient endocytosis of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (LDLRs) in selected tissues. Individuals lacking ARH (ARH-/-) have severe hypercholesterolemia due to impaired hepatic clearance of LDL. Immortalized lymphocytes, but not fibroblasts, from ARH-deficient subjects fail to internalize LDL. To further define the role of ARH in LDLR function, we compared the subcellular distribution of the LDLR in lymphocytes from normal and ARH-/- subjects. In normal lymphocytes LDLRs were predominantly located in intracellular compartments, whereas in ARH-/- cells the receptors were almost exclusively on the plasma membrane. Biochemical assays and quantification of LDLR by electron microscopy indicated that ARH-/- lymphocytes had >20-fold more LDLR on the cell surface and a ∼27-fold excess of LDLR outside of coated pits. The accumulation of LDLR on the cell surface was not due to failure of receptors to localize in coated pits since the number of LDLRs in coated pits was similar in ARH-/- and normal cells. Despite the dramatic increase in cell surface receptors, LDL binding was only 2-fold higher in the ARH-/- lymphocytes. These findings indicate that ARH is required not only for internalization of the LDL·LDLR complex but also for efficient binding of LDL to the receptor and suggest that ARH stabilizes the associations of the receptor with LDL and with the invaginating portion of the budding pit, thereby increasing the efficiency of LDL internalization.

The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) 1The abbreviations used are: LDLR, low density lipoprotein receptor; LDR, low density lipoprotein; EEA, early endosome antigen; β-VLDL, β-migrating very low density lipoprotein; apo, apolipoprotein; ARH, autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding. mediates the rapid endocytosis of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins. Internalization of the LDLR occurs via clathrin-coated pits and is mediated by a tyrosine-containing motif (NPXY) in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor (1Davis C.G. Lehrman M.A. Russell D.W. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1986; 45: 15-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The molecular machinery that sorts the LDLR to coated pits and promotes its rapid internalization has not been fully defined. Recently a crucial component of the machinery that internalizes LDLR was identified by elucidation of the molecular basis of autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH), a rare form of severe hypercholesterolemia. Patients with ARH have normal LDLR but markedly reduced clearance of circulating LDL by the liver (2Zuliani G. Vigna G.B. Corsini A. Maioli M. Romagnoni F. Fellin R. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 25: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Zuliani G. Arca M. Signore A. Bader G. Fazio S. Chianelli M. Bellosta S. Campagna F. Montali A. Maioli M. Pacifico A. Ricci G. Fellin R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The disorder is caused by mutations that inactivate a 308-amino acid adaptor protein named ARH (4Garcia C.K. Wilund K. Arca M. Zuliani G. Fellin R. Maioli M. Calandra S. Bertolini S. Cossu F. Grishin N. Barnes R. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2001; 292: 1394-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). ARH contains four highly conserved domains (5Cohen J.C. Kimmel M. Polanski A.

Biol. 2003; 23: 1963-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The first is a ∼40-amino acid N-terminal domain of unknown function that is followed by a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (4Garcia C.K. Wilund K. Arca M. Zuliani G. Fellin R. Maioli M. Calandra S. Bertolini S. Cossu F. Grishin N. Barnes R. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2001; 292: 1394-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). PTB domains are found in a variety of adaptor proteins involved in receptor trafficking and signaling (7Yan K.S. Kuti M. Zhou M.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Typically PTB domains of adaptor proteins bind receptors via a consensus sequence, NPXY, in the cytoplasmic tail. In vitro studies with purified recombinant proteins indicate that the PTB domain of ARH binds to the unphosphorylated FDNPVY internalization sequence in LDLR in a sequence-specific manner (8Mishra S.K. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16099-16104Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9He G. Gupta S. Yi M. Michaely P. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. J. Biol.

PTB domains share structural similarity with phosphoinositide-binding pleckstrin homology domains (10Forman-Kay J.D. Pawson T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and some PTB domains, including the domain in ARH, bind phosphoinositides (8Mishra S.K. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16099-16104Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4915-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Downstream of the PTB domain in ARH is a canonical clathrin box sequence (LLDLE), a conserved motif that mediates binding of several adaptor proteins to the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain (13Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 14Traub L.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The clathrin box sequence in ARH can mediate high affinity binding to the heavy chain of clathrin (8Mishra S.K. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16099-16104Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9He G. Gupta S. Yi M. Michaely P. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44044-44049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Finally ARH contains a highly conserved sequence at its C terminus that binds the β2-subunit of AP2, a second structural protein in coated pits (9He G. Gupta S. Yi M. Michaely P. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44044-44049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The combination of these three functional regions in one protein coupled with the requirement of ARH for LDL endocytosis led to the proposition that ARH is required either to chaperone LDLR to the coated pit or to promote the internalization of the receptor (8Mishra S.K. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16099-16104Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9He G. Gupta S. Yi M. Michaely P. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44044-44049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the specific role of ARH in LDLR endocytosis has been hampered by the fact that cultured skin fibroblasts, which provided critical insights into other aspects of LDLR function, do not recapitulate the defective LDLR internalization observed in ARH subjects (2Zuliani G. Vigna G.B. Corsini A. Maioli M. Romagnoni F. Fellin R. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 25: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whereas fibroblasts from LDLR-/- patients (homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) take up radiolabeled LDL at less than 10% of the rate observed in fibroblasts from normal individuals, fibroblasts from most ARH subjects take up and degrade LDL at 50–100% of the normal rate (15Arca M. Zuliani G. Wilund K. Campagna F. Fellin R. Bertolini S. Calandra S. Ricci G. Glorioso N. Maioli M. Pintus P. Carru C. Cossu F. Cohen J. Hobbs H.H. Lancet. 2002; 359: 841-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast to fibroblasts, LDLR function is significantly impaired in immortalized lymphocytes from ARH patients (16Norman D. Sun X.M. Bourbon M. Knight B.L. Naoumova R.P. Soutar A.K. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Wilund K.R. Yi M. Campagna F. Arca M. Zuliani G. Fellin R. Ho Y.K. Garcia J.V. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. Hum. Mol.

To further define the role of ARH in LDLR function we examined the cellular distribution and ligand binding characteristics of the LDLR in ARH-/- lymphocytes. Materials—All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Rabbit anti-LDLR IgG used for immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy was from Maine Biotechnology Services, Inc. (Portland, ME). Rabbit anti-LDLR (4548) used in biochemistry experiments was a gift from Joachim Herz. The mouse monoclonal antibody to LDL receptor (C7) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-human transferrin receptor antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), and mouse monoclonal anti-EEA was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa-Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and 10-nm gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG and PD-10 columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Formaldehyde was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), and sulfosuccinimidyl-6-biotinamido hexanoate and neutravidin-agarose were from Pierce. All other chemicals were from Sigma. LDL was prepared from freshly drawn human plasma as described previously (18Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Lymphocytes, isolated from circulating blood of normal subjects, subjects with ARH deficiency, and subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia, were immortalized using the Epstein-Barr virus (19Louie L.G. King M.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 637-638PubMed Google Scholar). Lymphocytes were maintained in Medium A (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). To upregulate expression of the LDLR, lymphocytes were grown in Medium B (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) human lipoprotein-poor serum, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immortalized normal, ARH-/-, and LDLR-/- lymphocytes were grown in Medium B for 48 h prior to mounting on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. The coverslips were rinsed briefly with Hanks' balanced salt solution and Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) before fixation in freshly prepared 3% (v/v) formaldehyde in Buffer A for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were rinsed twice in PBS (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.3) and then incubated in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 30 min. After rinsing twice in PBS, the fixed cells were permeabilized in PBS plus 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 7 min at 4 °C and then conditioned with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. For double immunofluorescence staining, rabbit anti-LDLR IgG (0.5 μg/ml) with either mouse monoclonal anti-human transferrin receptor (10 μg/ml) or mouse monoclonal anti-EEA (2.5 μg/ml) antibodies were applied to the coverslips overnight at 4 °C. The coverslips were rinsed with PBS and then incubated for 2 h with Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml) and Alexa-Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (10 μg/ml). The coverslips were rinsed in PBS prior to mounting and imaged using a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope. Electron Microscopy—Cultured lymphocytes were immersion-fixed in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in Buffer A for 60 min. The lymphocytes were suspended in 2% (w/v) agar and then infused in 2 m sucrose containing 15% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (10 kDa). Frozen ultrathin sections were prepared using a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome equipped with a Leica EMFCS cryochamber. The sections were lifted onto nickel grids in 1.8% (v/v) methylcellulose and 2.3 m sucrose (1:1) and stored overnight on gelatin at 4 °C (20Tokuyasu K.T. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1978; 63: 287-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 21Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1980; 12: 381-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 22Liou W. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Before immunolabeling, the gelatin was liquefied at 37 °C, and the nickel grids were removed. The sections were washed by floating the sections on droplets of PBS. For immunogold localization, the grids with the attached thin sections were conditioned on droplets containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS (Buffer B) for 10 min at room temperature. The grids were incubated for 2 h in the presence of rabbit anti-LDLR IgG antibody and diluted in Buffer B to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. The sections were rinsed on droplets of PBS and then incubated with 10-nm gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:40) in Buffer B containing 10% normal goat serum. Finally the grids with the attached thin sections were rinsed in PBS, fixed with 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min, embedded, and stained with methylcellulose and uranyl acetate (20Tokuyasu K.T. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1978; 63: 287-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 21Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1980; 12: 381-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). For cell surface immunolabeling, the lymphocytes were formaldehyde-fixed as described above, rinsed in Buffer B, and incubated with rabbit anti-LDLR IgG antibody (1 μg/ml) in Buffer B for 17 h. The primary antibodies were localized by incubating the cells for 2 h with 10-nm gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:40) in Buffer B. After extensive washings, the cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and postfixed in 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide. Subsequently the specimens were rinsed in distilled water, dehydrated with graded ethanol, and then Epon-embedded according to the manufacturer's protocol (Electron Microscope Science). Ultrathin sections (∼80 nm) were cut with a diamond knife using a Leica Ultracut R ultramicrotome and placed on Formvar/carbon-coated nickel grids. Ultrathin sections were stained with 3% aqueous uranyl acetate (15 min) and lead acetate (5 min). Electron micrographs were taken using a JEOL 1200 electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Colloidal gold-conjugated LDL was produced as described previously (23Pathak R.K. Yokode M. Hammer R.E. Hofmann S.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly 100 ml of 10% (w/v) gold chloride was added to 100 ml of boiling H2O. After 10 s, 2 ml of 1% trisodium citrate was added, and the mixture was maintained at 100 °C for 5 min. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, adjusted to a pH of 6 with dipotassium phosphate, and then centrifuged at 800 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove aggregates. The colloidal gold was collected by centrifugation at 17,500 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The centrifuged material was aspirated to a volume of 1 ml. The colloidal gold pellet was resuspended and added to an equal volume of human LDL (1 mg/ml), which had been dialyzed overnight in 50 mm EDTA, pH 6.0. After allowing the mixture to equilibrate to room temperature (60 min), the mixture was overlaid on a 35% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 17,500 × g for 60 min at 12 °C. The colloidal gold-LDL in the pellet was resuspended in PBS (2.5 ml), solvent-exchanged over a PD-10 column equilibrated in PBS, and dialyzed twice against 3 liters of PBS at 4 °C. The colloidal gold-labeled LDL was used within 5 days of synthesis. Immortalized lymphocytes were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml in Medium B and cultured for 2 days. Cells were then counted and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells in 1 ml of Medium B at either 4 or 37 °C prior to addition of 10 μg/ml colloidal gold-labeled LDL. The cells were maintained at either 4 or 37 °C for 90 min prior to centrifugation at 900 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and then washed three times using Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Cells were fixed, embedded, sectioned, and placed on nickel grids as described above. Quantification of Gold Labeling—Electron microscope images were obtained by randomly taking 100 photographs of each cell type (normal, ARH-/-, and LDLR-/-) that had been labeled with the LDLR-specific antibody and 25 photographs of each cell type labeled with the colloidal gold-LDL. The length of the non-coated pit membranes, the diameter of the coated pits, and the number of gold particles associated with each of these two regions were determined. The labeling intensity was expressed as the number of gold particles per micrometer length of the different regions of the plasma membrane. Clusters of tightly associated gold particles in the experiments using LDL were counted as one since these likely represented aggregates of LDL. Gold particles separated by a gap greater than twice their diameter were counted as single particles. Quantification of Cell Surface LDLR—A total of 5 × 106 lymphocytes were washed with ice-cold Medium C (1× Eagle's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and incubated on a rotator with 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody to human LDLR (C7) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the human LDLR (4548) (7 μg/ml) for 90 min at 4 °C. Cells incubated with 4548 were washed five times in Buffer C and then resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer C with 1 μCi of 125I-Protein A prior to rotating for 60 min at 4 °C. After incubation with either 125I-C7 or 125I-Protein A, cells were washed three times with Buffer C and twice with Buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and then resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer D. Cellular protein was determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar), and the 125I counts were determined using half of the sample. The counts were normalized to the cellular protein. In the case of C7, counts were converted to fmol of C7. All experiments were performed in triplicate. An additional method used to quantify cell surface LDLR was by biotinylating the cell surface proteins (25Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly 2.5 × 106 cells were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS plus sulfosuccinimidyl-6-biotinamido hexanoate (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing. Cells were then washed with Buffer D and incubated with Buffer D for 30 min on ice to quench any residual biotin reagent. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with 60 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 4 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) at room temperature for 30 min with end-over-end mixing. Cells were subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge to remove insoluble debris. A total of 15 μl of lysate was retained (Lysate). A total of 40 μl of lysate was added to 100 μl of a 50% slurry of neutravidin-agarose and 660 μl of lysis buffer. The mixture was rotated for 60 min at 4 °C and then pelleted. The supernatants consisted of unbiotinylated material, which contained internal proteins (Internal). The beads were washed three times with 15 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm EGTA, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.0 and then in the same buffer without NaCl. Proteins that remained associated with the beads were biotinylated and represented proteins exposed on the cell surface. This material was eluted by incubating the beads in SDS sample buffer at 90 °C for 5 min (Surface). Samples were then size-fractionated by 5–17% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and processed for immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal anti-LDLR antibody (4548). Endocytosis of LDLR—Endocytosis of the LDLR was monitored using a modification of the protocol described previously (26Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 493-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Briefly 5 × 106 lymphocytes were aliquoted into 5 ml of Medium B. Monensin was added to a final concentration of 25 mm for 0, 5, 20, or 60 min such that all incubations ended at the same time. Cells were plunged into ice-cold PBS to inhibit further endocytosis, washed with cold PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS plus sulfosuccinimidyl-6-biotinamido hexanoate (1 mg/ml), and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing. Samples were then processed for surface expression of LDLR using neutravidin-agarose as described above. Lipoprotein Binding Assays—Radiolabeled human 125I-LDL and rabbit 125I-labeled β-migrating very low density lipoprotein (125I-β-VLDL) binding assays were performed in triplicate as described previously (18Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Acid and EDTA washes were conducted at 4 °C using Buffer E containing 50 mm Tris maleate, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.6 (control), Buffer E at pH 5.0 (acid wash), or Buffer E with 10 mm EDTA (EDTA wash) for 1 h with end-over-end mixing prior to addition of 125I-LDL. The experiments used to compile the data for the Scatchard plots included the following modifications. In each experiment, 2.5 × 106 lymphocytes were suspended in 100 μl of ice-cold Medium C. The cells were then incubated with 5 μg/ml 125I-LDL together with increasing concentrations of cold LDL (up to 5 mg/ml). The specific activity of the labeled LDL in each assay was recalculated based upon the total LDL concentration. Bound and free counts were separated by centrifugation of the cells through a cushion of Medium C plus 10% sucrose at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Tubes were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and cut to separate the bound and free LDL. The amount of free and bound LDL in each assay was calculated using the specific activity of LDL in each assay and assembled into a Scatchard plot. Ligand blot assays were performed as described previously (27Daniel T.O. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4606-4611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In normal cells, LDL binds to the LDLR on the cell surface, and the LDL·LDLR complex is internalized and delivered to endosomes. In the low pH environment of the endosome, the receptor dissociates from the lipoprotein and recycles to the cell surface. LDL that is released from the receptor in the endosome is degraded, delivering cholesterol to the cell. The degradation of 125I-LDL is severely compromised in ARH-/- lymphocytes despite an increased amount of LDL binding to the surfaces of these cells (16Norman D. Sun X.M. Bourbon M. Knight B.L. Naoumova R.P. Soutar A.K. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Wilund K.R. Yi M. Campagna F. Arca M. Zuliani G. Fellin R. Ho Y.K. Garcia J.V. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3019-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine whether the decreased LDL degradation in ARH-/- cells is due to a failure of LDLR internalization, ARH-/- and normal lymphocytes were treated with monensin to block LDLR recycling, and the rates of disappearance of LDLR from the cell surface were compared in the two cell lines (Fig. 1). The half-life of LDLR at the plasma membrane was ∼8 min in normal lymphocytes, a value similar to that seen in fibroblasts (26Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 493-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In contrast, no loss of surface LDLR was detected in ARH-/- cells after 60 min. These results are consistent with a failure of LDLR to be internalized in ARH-/- lymphocytes. A potential consequence of the failure to internalize LDLR is an accumulation of receptors on the cell surface. We examined the localization of the LDLR in normal and ARH-/- cells using immunofluorescence. In normal lymphocytes LDLR staining was observed predominantly in internal compartments (Fig. 2). The internal LDLR staining co-localized with the early endosome marker EEA1 (Fig. 2) and partially co-localized with the lysosomal marker lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (data not shown). In contrast, LDLR was predominantly on the cell surface of ARH-/- lymphocytes. The distribution of LDLR in the ARH-/- lymphocytes mirrors the distribution observed previously in hepatocytes from ARH-/- mice (28Jones C. Hammer R.E. Li W.P. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29024-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The relative abundance of surface LDLR on normal and ARH-/- cells was quantified by biotinylating cell surface proteins, precipitating with neutravidin-agarose, and immunoblotting for the LDLR. ARH-/- cells had ∼20-fold more LDLR on the cell surface than normal cells (Fig. 3A). A similar increase in LDLR number was seen when cell surface LDLRs were detected with 125I-labeled monoclonal anti-LDLR antibody or with polyclonal anti-LDLR followed by 125I-Protein A (Fig. 3, B and C).Fig. 3Loss of ARH dramatically increases the amount of immunodetectable LDLR on the cell surface. In A, LDLR-/-, normal, and ARH-/- cells were treated with a non-cell-permeable biotinylation reagent, washed, and lysed with Triton X-100. After removal of insoluble debris, one-fourth of the lysate was set aside, while two-thirds of the lysate was incubated with neutravidin-agarose to precipitate biotinylated proteins. Shown in the upper portion of A is an immunoblot of lysates (lanes 1–3), biotin-free material (lanes 4–6), and biotinylated material (lanes 7–9). Lanes 1, 4, and 7 were from LDLR-/- lymphocytes; lanes 2, 5, and 8 were from normal cells; and lanes 3, 6, and 9 were from ARH-/- cells. The lower portion of A shows a quantification of the immunoblot normalized to sample size. In B, the relative number of LDLRs on the cell surface was determined by incubating LDLR-/-, ARH-/-, and normal lymphocytes with an 125I-labeled mouse monoclonal antibody against the LDLR (C7) at 4 °C for 90 min. Cells were washed, lysed, and counted on a γ counter. The cellular protein content was determined and used to normalize each sample. In C, the relative number of LDLRs on the cell surface was determined by incubating LDLR-/-, normal, and ARH-/- lymphocytes and a no-cell control with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the LDLR at 4 °C. Cells were then washed, incubated with 125I-Protein A, washed again, lysed, and counted on a γ counter. The cellular protein content was used to normalize each sample.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the accumulation of LDLR on the plasma membranes of ARH-/- lymphocytes reflected a failure to cluster the receptors in coated pits, the surface distribution of LDLR was examined by immunoelectron microscopy. In agreement with the immunofluorescence data (Fig. 2), LDLR was located predominantly on the cell surfaces of ARH-/- lymphocytes, while in normal cells the LDLR was associated with internal vesicular structures resembling endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 4). Quantification of immunogold particles on the cell surface revealed a ∼23-fold increase in the number of LDLRs/μm of membrane in the ARH-/- cells (Table I). Surprisingly there were at least as many LDLRs/μm of membrane in the coated pits of ARH-/- cells as in normal cells (Table I). The large increase (>27-fold) in the number of LDLRs in the non-coated pit membrane of the ARH-/- cells resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of surface LDLRs in coated pits of the ARH-/- cells as compared with normal cells (1 versus 31%). Thus, the loss of ARH resulted in"
https://openalex.org/W1991465877,"The α4β1-integrin (very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), CD49d/CD29) is an adhesion receptor involved in the interaction of lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and stem cells with the extracellular matrix and endothelial cells. This and other integrins have the ability to regulate their affinity for ligands through a process termed “inside-out” signaling that affects cell adhesion avidity. Several mechanisms are known to regulate integrin affinity and conformation: conformational changes induced by separation of the C-terminal tails, divalent ions, and reducing agents. Recently, we described a fluorescent LDV-containing small molecule that was used to monitor VLA-4 affinity changes in live cells (Chigaev, A., Blenc, A. M., Braaten, J. V., Kumaraswamy, N., Kepley, C. L., Andrews, R. P., Oliver, J. M., Edwards, B. S., Prossnitz, E. R., Larson, R. S., and Sklar, L. A. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 48670–48678). Using the same molecule, we also developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay to probe the “switchblade-like” opening of VLA-4 upon activation. Here, we investigated the effect of reducing agents on the affinity and conformational state of the VLA-4 integrin simultaneously with cell activation initiated by inside-out signaling through G protein-coupled receptors or Mn2+ in live cells in real time. We found that reducing agents (dithiothreitol and 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid) induced multiple states of high affinity of VLA-4, where the affinity change was accompanied by an extension of the integrin molecule. Bacitracin, an inhibitor of the reductive function of the plasma membrane, diminished the effect of dithiothreitol, but had no effect on inside-out signaling. Based on this result and differences in the kinetics of integrin activation, we conclude that conformational activation of VLA-4 by inside-out signaling is independent of and additive to reduction-regulated integrin activation.

Elbarbary A. Zhu M. Ashjian P. Benhaim P. Hedrick M.H. Fraser J.K. Immunol. Lett. 2003; 89: 267-270Google Scholar). VLA-4 has a flexible molecular structure that allows initial capture, tethering, rolling, and firm attachment of cells using the same counterstructure (3Alon R. Kassner P.D. Carr M.W. Finger E.B. Hemler M.E. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1243-1253Google Scholar, 4Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 228-234Google Scholar). These properties appear to result from regulation of affinity and conformation by “inside-out” signaling (5Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Google Scholar, 6Takagi J. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 141-163Google Scholar). Although the precise molecular mechanism of integrin conformational activation is unknown, significant understanding of this mechanism has been achieved in the last several years. One model involves the “mechano-conformational” regulation of integrin affinity and conformation. It is based on the idea that the separation of the intracellular α- and β-subunit tails may initiate “a piston-like or scissors-like motion” of the transmembrane domains (7Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T. Plow E. Qin J. Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Google Scholar). This motion results in a large conformational rearrangement of the integrin, accompanied by a “switchblade-like” opening of the molecule (8Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Google Scholar) and its conformational activation (5Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Google Scholar, 6Takagi J.

Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Google Scholar). This “tail separation model” is supported by the experiments by Lu et al. (11Lu C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14642-14648Google Scholar) and Takagi et al. (12Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 412-416Google Scholar), in which unclasping of the link between C-terminal parts of the integrin subunits results in the conformational activation of the molecule. A direct demonstration of the spatial separation of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 integrin tails by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been recently published (10Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Google Scholar). The tail separation might be induced by binding of adaptor proteins such as talin (a common adaptor protein that binds to the β-subunits) (13Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Google Scholar) and paxillin (an α4-specific adaptor, whose binding is regulated by phosphorylation of the integrin) (14Han J. Rose D.M. Woodside D.G. Goldfinger L.E.

Another model suggests that integrin conformation is regulated by reduction of the disulfide bonds and possibly involves protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) (17Essex D.W. Li M. Miller A. Feinman R.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6070-6075Google Scholar, 18Lahav J. Jurk K. Hess O. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. Luboshitz J. Kehrel B.E. Blood. 2002; 100: 2472-2478Google Scholar, 19Lahav J. Wijnen E.M.

Moreover, dithiothreitol (DTT) and other reducing agents elevate integrin-mediated cell adhesion avidity (21Edwards B.S. Curry M.S. Southon E.A. Chong A.S. Graf Jr., L.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 2288-2301Google Scholar, 22Edwards B.S. Southon E.A. Curry M.S. Salazar F. Gale J.M. Robinson M.K. Graf Jr., L.H. Born J.L. J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 89-92Google Scholar). Bacitracin, an inhibitor of the reductive function of the plasma membrane, and anti-PDI monoclonal antibody (mAb) cause inhibition of ligand binding to the β3-integrin (19Lahav J. Wijnen E.M. Hess O. Hamaia S.W. Griffiths D. Makris M. Knight C.G. Essex D.W. Farndale R.W. Blood. 2003; 102: 2085-2092Google Scholar). A number of mutational studies have shown that disruption of disulfides in the integrin β3-subunit results in constitutively active integrins (Cys5, Cys435, Cys560, Cys598, Cys663, and Cys687) (25Butta N.

Truncated β3-subunits (amino acids 1–469) lacking the Cys-rich domain form heterodimers that bind fibrinogen with high affinity (29Wippler J. Kouns W.C. Schlaeger E.J. Kuhn H. Hadvary P. Steiner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8754-8761Google Scholar). In addition, all 56 cysteines in the integrin β-subunits were found to be well conserved throughout evolution (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 30Brower D.L. Brower S.M. Hayward D.C. Ball E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9182-9187Google Scholar). Thus, there is good evidence that reduction or disruption of the disulfide bonds could be an important mechanism in the regulation of the integrin-dependent cell adhesion. Recently, we developed a new approach for monitoring the relationship between VLA-4 affinity, cell avidity, and molecular conformation. Using a VLA-4-specific fluorescent probe based on an LDV-containing compound, we were able to monitor changes in integrin affinity and conformation in real time in live cells in response to cell activation by inside-out signaling (31Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48670-48678Google Scholar, 32Chigaev A. Buranda T. Dwyer D.C. Prossnitz E.R. Sklar L.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3951-3962Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated a strong correlation between VLA-4 affinity and cell adhesion avidity (33Chigaev A. Zwartz G. Graves S.W. Dwyer D.C. Tsuji H. Foutz T.D. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38174-38182Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to investigate the role of reducing agents in regulating integrin conformation and affinity. We found that reducing agents induced multiple affinity states of VLA-4 and that the affinity changes were accompanied by an extension of VLA-4 detected using FRET. Bacitracin, an inhibitor of the reductive function of the plasma membrane, diminished the effect of reducing agents and had no effect on the inside-out signaling generated using G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Based on these results and differences in the kinetics of integrin activation, we conclude that the activation of VLA-4 by inside-out signaling is independent of activation by reducing agents.

(Richmond, VA). Octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). All other reagents were from Sigma. Cell Lines and Transfectant Construct—The human monoblastoid cell line U937 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Site-directed mutants of the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) in U937 cells were prepared as described (34Kew R.R. Peng T. DiMartino S.J. Madhavan D. Weinman S.J. Cheng D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 329-337Google Scholar). High expressers were selected using the MoFlo flow cytometer (Cytomation, Inc., Fort Collins, CO). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum; harvested; resuspended in 1 ml of HEPES buffer (110 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) containing 0.1% human serum albumin; and stored on ice. The buffer was depleted of lipopolysaccharide by affinity chromatography over polymyxin B-Sepharose (Detoxigel, Pierce). Cells were counted using a Coulter Multisizer/Z2 analyzer. For experiments, cells were suspended in HEPES buffer at 1 × 106 cells/ml and warmed to 37 °C. The expression of VLA-4 was measured with fluorescent mAbs and quantified by comparison with a standard curve generated with Quantum Simply Cellular microspheres (Bangs Laboratories, Inc., Fishers, IN) stained in parallel with the same mAb. This produces an estimate of the total mAb-binding sites/cell. Typically, we find 40,000–60,000 VLA-4 sites/U937 cell. Kinetic Analysis of Binding and Dissociation—Kinetic analysis of the binding and dissociation of the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule was described previously (31Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48670-48678Google Scholar). Briefly, U937 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were preincubated in HEPES buffer containing 0.1% human serum albumin under different conditions for 10–40 min at 37 °C: divalent cations (Mn2+, Ca2+), DTT (up to 3 mm), or 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS; up to 50 mm). Flow cytometric data were acquired for up to 1000sat37 °C while the samples were stirred continuously at 300 rpm with a 5 × 2-mm magnetic stir bar (Bel-Art Products, Pequannock, NJ). Samples were analyzed for 30–120 s to establish a base line. The fluorescent ligand was added, and acquisition was re-established, creating a 5–10-s gap in the time course. For real-time activation experiments, U937 cells were preincubated with 4 nm LDV-FITC-containing small molecule for 15 min at 37 °C. Then, data were acquired for 30–120 s to establish a base line, and DTT (3 mm), N-formyl-l-methionyl-l-leucyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-phenylalanine (fMLFF; 100 nm), or ATP (1 μm) was added. Acquisition was re-established, and data were acquired continuously for up to 1000 s. The concentration of the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule chosen for the experiments (4 nm) is below the dissociation constant (Kd) for binding to resting VLA-4 (low affinity; Kd ∼ 12 nm) and above the Kd for the physiologically activated receptor (high affinity; Kd ∼ 1–2 nm) (31Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48670-48678Google Scholar). Therefore, the transition from the low to high affinity receptor state leads to increased binding of the probe (from ∼25 to ∼70–80% of receptor occupancy, respectively), which is detected as an increase in the mean channel fluorescence. For dissociation kinetic measurements, cell samples were preincubated with the fluorescent ligand (4–10 nm) and treated with excess unlabeled LDV-containing small molecule (2 μm), and the dissociation of the fluorescent molecule was followed. The resulting data were converted to mean channel fluorescence versus time using FCSQuery software (developed by one of us, B. S. E.). Cell Pretreatment with Bacitracin—U937 cells were preincubated on ice for 1.5 h with 1 mm bacitracin. Prior to the experiment, 4 nm LDV-FITC-containing small molecule was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 15 min. Data were acquired using a flow cytometer for 30 s to establish a base line. Then, DTT (3 mm), fMLFF (100 nm), or ATP (1 μm) was added. For dissociation experiments, cells were preincubated with bacitracin and the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule as described above and treated with excess unlabeled LDV-containing small molecule (2 μm). The dissociation of the fluorescent molecule was followed. FRET Detection of Integrin Conformational Activation—The FRET assay was performed with a peptide donor (the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule, which specifically binds to the α4-integrin head group) and octadecyl rhodamine B acceptors incorporated into the plasma membrane previously described in detail (32Chigaev A. Buranda T. Dwyer D.C. Prossnitz E.R. Sklar L.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3951-3962Google Scholar). Briefly, U937 cells were preincubated with 50–100 nm LDV-FITC-containing small molecule to saturate low affinity sites of the integrin in HEPES buffer containing 0.1% human serum albumin supplemented with 1 mm Mn2+, 1 mm Ca2+, 1–3 mm DTT, or a combination of the reagents for up to 50 min at 37 °C. Next, samples were incubated with different concentrations of R18 (up to 20 μm) for 1 min. Donor intensities (FL1) were measured using a BD Biosciences FACScan flow cytometer at 37 °C. The quenching curves generated using the following procedure characterize the distance of closest approach between the integrin head group and the surface lipid membrane as was shown previously (32Chigaev A. Buranda T. Dwyer D.C. Prossnitz E.R. Sklar L.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3951-3962Google Scholar). For real-time FRET experiments, U937 cells were stably transfected with the wild-type FPR or its non-desensitizing mutant (FPRΔST) (35Hsu M.H. Chiang S.C. Ye R.D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29426-29429Google Scholar, 36Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15213-15219Google Scholar). The U937 cells were preincubated with 50–100 nm LDV-FITC-containing small molecule in HEPES buffer containing 1.5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed for 60–120 s to establish a base line, and then saturating R18 (10 μm final concentration) was added to yield maximal quenching. 1 min after R18 was added, the fMLFF peptide (0.1 μm), ATP (1 μm), or DTT (3 mm) was added. Flow cytometer acquisition was re-established after a 5–10-s gap. The cells were also tested using low concentrations of the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule (3–5 nm) to determine the affinity change as described above. Statistical Analysis—Curve fits and statistics were determined using GraphPad Prism. Mean values are presented in Table I and the figures. Each experiment was repeated three times. The experimental curves represent the mean of two independent runs. S.E. values were calculated using GraphPad Prism.Table ISummary of dissociation rate constants for U937 cells treated with different concentrations of DTT and DMPSCell treatmentFraction of VLA-4 receptors in affinity statekoff = 0.06 s-1aThis LDV-FITC-containing small molecule dissociation rate corresponds to the low affinity (resting) state of VLA-4 (31, 33).koff = 0.01 s-1bThis LDV-FITC-containing small molecule dissociation rate corresponds to the physiologically activated affinity state (31).koff = 0.002 s-1Untreated0.970.03300 μm DTT0.610.140.251 mm DTT0.280.190.523 mm DTT0.120.30, 0.37 (0.014)0.58, 0.63 (0.002)1 mm DMPScBecause of the difference in redox potentials, DMPS was used at a higher concentration than DTT.0.780.090.1320 mm DMPS0.450.420.1350 mm DMPS0.200.570.23a This LDV-FITC-containing small molecule dissociation rate corresponds to the low affinity (resting) state of VLA-4 (31Chigaev A.

Open table in a new tab Reducing Agents Generate Multiple Affinity States of the VLA-4 Integrin as Detected Using the Fluorescent Ligand— Multiple affinity states of VLA-4 have been detected using the LDV-FITC-containing molecule in real time in response to activation by divalent cations; activating mAbs; or inside-out signaling in response to stimulation of CXC chemokine receptor-2 and -4, FPR, and IgE and interleukin-5 receptors (31Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48670-48678Google Scholar). The affinity of the LDV-FITC probe for the integrin varies in parallel with the affinity of a native ligand, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Cell adhesion avidity was found to be strongly dependent on the affinity of the integrin (33Chigaev A. Zwartz G. Graves S.W. Dwyer D.C. Tsuji H. Foutz T.D. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38174-38182Google Scholar, 37Zwartz G. Chigaev A. Foutz T. Larson R.S. Posner R. Sklar L.A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1243-1252Google Scholar). Here, we used the same LDV-FITC-containing molecule to probe the affinity of VLA-4 on the surface of U937 cells treated with different concentrations of DTT and DMPS. DMPS is known to be a membrane-impermeable reducing agent due to the presence of a charged acidic group. Fig. 1A shows a typical binding and dissociation experiment in which the LDV-FITC-containing molecule was added to a cell suspension after 30 s of stirring. Excess unlabeled competitor was added 3 min later. By fitting the dissociation kinetics to double exponential curves, we extracted rate constants corresponding to states of different affinity (Table I). In all experiments, with the exception of those performed with untreated cells, a combination of high and low affinity state receptors was detected (Fig. 1, A–C). For untreated cells, only a single exponential fit was needed, and koff ∼ 0.06–0.1 s–1 was obtained. This off-rate corresponds to the resting receptor state (31Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48670-48678Google Scholar). In addition, a resting state was detected in cells treated with low concentrations of reducing agents (300 μm DTT and 1–20 mm DMPS) (Table I). Changes in VLA-4 affinity were strongly dose-dependent, and fits required at least two dissociation rates. Under the strongest reducing conditions (3 mm DTT), the dissociation could be fit with two rates (0.014/s and 0.002/s) or with three rates, resembling the resting, intermediate, and high affinity states. For consistency, all the data were fit with three fixed rates, with higher concentrations of DTT and DMPS or longer incubation times resulting in a larger fraction of high affinity receptors (Table I). The progression of quantitatively similar states led to the idea that a sequential reduction of each of the disulfide bonds generates a distinctive conformation of the molecule (Fig. 1D). Kinetics of the Affinity Changes Induced by Mn2+and DTT in Real Time—Next, real-time activation was used to measure the kinetics of the VLA-4 affinity change. U937 cells were preincubated with the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule and treated with DTT alone or in combination with 1 mm Mn2+ (Fig. 2). Mn2+ is used to induce a higher affinity state of VLA-4 with a distinctive extended conformation (31Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48670-48678Google Scholar, 32Chigaev A. Buranda T. Dwyer D.C. Prossnitz E.R. Sklar L.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3951-3962Google Scholar). The effect of Mn2+ was stable and irreversible for >1000 s. The addition of DTT induced a slow and gradual increase in the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule binding. This was completely different from a rapid activation induced by Mn2+ (Fig. 2A). Next, when the two stimuli were added together, biphasic binding kinetics were observed. A rapid binding phase (60–120 s) resembling the Mn2+-alone curve was followed by a slow gradual signal increase similar to the DTT-alone curve (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the dissociation kinetics (Fig. 2B) confirmed that DTT added together with Mn2+ created higher VLA-4 affinity than Mn2+ added alone (a slower dissociation rate corresponds to a state of higher affinity (31Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48670-48678Google Scholar)). Exposure of disulfides to solvent is a factor that regulates the rate of disulfide reduction by reducing agents. Therefore, we investigated whether a conformational change in the integrin molecule induced by cations affects the response to DTT. We subtracted the curve corresponding to activation by Mn2+ alone (Fig. 2A, closed circles) from the curve corresponding to DTT and Mn2+ (open circles). The resulting curve is plotted in Fig. 2C (open circles) together with the DTT-alone curve from Fig. 2A (closed triangles). We found that the slope of the curve corresponding to DTT and Mn2+ minus Mn2+ was approximately two times larger than that of the curve corresponding to DTT alone. Thus, the rate of DTT-induced activation of integrin was higher for the extended conformation induced by Mn2+. This suggests that the conformational change in VLA-4 induced by ions facilitates a subsequent change in the affinity induced by DTT. Presumably, this could be achieved by exposing disulfides, which are less accessible to DTT in the resting conformation. Next, cells were preincubated with Mn2+ in the presence or absence of DTT (Fig. 2D) to test whether the addition of DTT can generate a higher affinity state than that induced by Mn2+ alone. In our previous experiments, the dissociation constant (Kd) for the binding of the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule in 1 mm Mn2+ (in the absence of other divalent ions) was ∼0.1–0.3 nm, and koff was ∼0.0005–0.0007 s–1 (33Chigaev A. Zwartz G. Graves S.W. Dwyer D.C. Tsuji H. Foutz T.D. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38174-38182Google Scholar). Fig. 2D shows that the koff was at least five times slower for DTT-treated cells (koff ∼ 0.0001 s–1). This value corresponds to a Kd of ∼20–60 pm. Thus, the addition of DTT induced a higher affinity state compared with divalent cations only. This suggests that the mechanism of integrin activation by reducing agents is independent of and additive to the one induced by ions. Kinetics of the Affinity Changes Induced through Inside-out Signaling Differ from those Induced by Activation by DTT—Next, to determine whether DTT affects integrin activation through inside-out signaling, cells were treated with DTT alone or in combination with activation using two GPCR ligands: fMLFF (ligand for the FPR) (Fig. 3) and ATP (ligand for P2Y receptors) (Supplemental Fig. 1). Whereas U937 cells are transfected with the FPR (34Kew R.R. Peng T. DiMartino S.J. Madhavan D. Weinman S.J. Cheng D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 329-337Google Scholar, 36Pr"

This phenomenon is associated with the ability of the cyclic nucleoside to inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines without affecting the differentiation process of the dendritic cells (DCs). Here we investigated the ability of cAMP to modulate the endotoxin signaling by exposing DCs to exogenous 8-bromium-cyclic AMP in the presence or absence of H89, a selective inhibitor of the protein kinase A, one of the major molecular targets of the cyclic nucleoside. cAMP affects the early lipopolysaccharide-induced signaling cascade dissociating the activation of NF-κB, p38, and ERK pathways from the stimulation of c-Src and Lyn kinases. This phenomenon was prevented by H89. The pharmacological block of Src-like tyrosine kinases induces comparable results confirming the involvement of this family of enzymes in the mechanism controlling the release of cytokines in human monocyte-derived iDCs. We propose that the cAMP-protein kinase A-dependent pathway regulates the functional plasticity of iDCs by gating the Toll-like receptor signaling at the level of Src-like kinases.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 271-296Google Scholar, 2Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Google Scholar). In peripheral tissues, DCs display an immature phenotype characterized by a high rate of endocytosis and low antigen-presenting capability. Upon encountering microbial products or inflammatory cytokines, immature DCs (iDCs) undergo a complex maturation process. They reduce the antigen uptake capability and up-regulate the cell surface expression of a variety of proteins including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II and adhesion and costimulatory molecules. Maturation of DCs is also associated with changes in the cell surface expression of several chemokine receptors (3Sallusto F. Schaerli P. Loetscher P. Schaniel C. Lenig D. Mackay C.R. Oin S. Lanzavecchia A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2760-2769Google Scholar). This phenomenon is crucial for their migration from inflamed tissues to regional lymph nodes. The continuous traffic of T-lymphocytes through the paracortical areas of lymph nodes makes this a prime site for antigen-loaded DCs to encounter the low frequency, antigen-specific naive T-cells and to initiate the immune response. The antigen-presenting capacity of DCs critically depends on their state of maturation that determines the extent of T-cell activation as well as the type of T-cell response. A number of facts have shown that DCs can be not only immunogenic but also tolerogenic, both intrathymically (4Brocker T. Riedinger M. Karjalainen K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 541-550Google Scholar, 5Finkelman F. Lees A. Bimbaum R. Gause W. Morris S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1406-1414Google Scholar) and in the periphery (6Shwartz R.H. Science. 1990; 248: 1349-1350Google Scholar). DCs display a functional plasticity (7Lanzavecchia A. Sallusto F. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 291-298Google Scholar) and can be instructed to polarize T-cells by mediators that are present in the peripheral environment. These factors affect the differentiation process of the iDCs, the exit of the mature DCs (mDCs) from the inflamed tissues (8D'Amico G. Frascaroli G. Bianchi G. Transidico P. Doni A. Vecchi A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Mantovani A. Nat. Immun. 2000; 1: 387-391Google Scholar), and the production of cytokines by mDCs after they have migrated to the lymph nodes (9Kalinski P. Hilkens C.M.

Because protein kinase A (PKA) is one of the molecular targets of the cyclic nucleoside, we also tested the ability of H89, a selective PKA inhibitor, to prevent the cAMP-mediated effects. We found that cAMP was able to uncouple the NF-κB, p38, and ERK pathways from the activation of Src family kinases. The modified signaling cascade generated in the presence of high intracellular levels of cAMP was able to support the maturation process and the synthesis of IL-10, but it was not sufficient to induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Significantly, these effects were prevented by preincubating DCs with H89. These findings shed new light on the role of the cAMP/PKA pathway in the early biochemical events regulating the process of dendritic cell maturation. Media and Reagents—The medium used throughout was RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 ng/ml streptomycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) or 2% human serum (Sigma). Granulocytes monocytes-colony stimulating factor was purchased from Schering-Plough (Kenilworth, NJ) and used at a concentration of 50 ng/ml. IL-4 was obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). 8-Br-cAMP and PGE2 were purchased from Sigma and used at 200 and 1 μm, respectively. H89 and PP2 were purchased from Calbiochem and used at 10 μm. In Vitro Generation and Culture of Human DCs—DCs were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as described (21Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Google Scholar), with some modification. Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 30 ml of leukocyte-enriched buffy coat from healthy donors by centrifugation with F Lymphoprep gradient (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway), and the light density fraction was recovered. Monocytes were purified by positive selection using anti-CD14 conjugated magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bologna, Italy). CD14+ cells were cultured at a concentration of 0.5–1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum or 2% human serum (Sigma), 25 mm HEPES, and 2 mm glutamine (complete medium) containing 50 ng/ml granulocytes monocytes-colony stimulating factor and 250 ng/ml IL-4. Cells were cultured for 4–5 days to obtain a population of iDCs. For preparation of mDCs, iDCs were cultured for 24–48 h in the presence of 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma). Autologous iDCs were generated in the presence of 2% human serum (Sigma). T-lymphocyte Differentiation—T-lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors by Lymphoprep (Nyegaard, Oslo, Norway) density gradient centrifugation. Resting T-cells were then purified from plastic nonadherent cells by the adherence of nylon wool (Robbins Scientific Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) to remove B cells followed by a two-step (40 and 50%, respectively) Percoll gradient (Amersham Biosciences). Resting lymphocytes were recovered from the highly density cell fraction. The CD4+ CD45RA cells were separated by negative selection using subset-specific monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD8, -CD19, -DR, -CD45RO, CD16, -CD56, -γδ TCR, all from BD Biosciences) and anti-Ig-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Dynal; Oslo, Norway). Purity of the lymphoid population was tested by flow cytometry. The purity of the naive lymphocytes was also tested by a functional assay; stimulation with an optimal dose of PHA (1 μg/ml) did not induce a detectable mitogenic response. Conversely, an optimal response was observed upon addition to the culture of 10% dendritic cells or anti-CD28 antibody (BD Biosciences) (data not shown). The mitogenic capability of 8-Br-cAMP-treated dendritic cells was tested by stimulating naive T-cells with increasing doses of TSST-1 (Sigma), in the absence or in the presence of 10 of the following autologous antigen-presenting cells: monocytes, DCs exposed for 18 h to LPS and DCs generated in the presence of LPS and 8-Br-cAMP. After 5 days, cells were cultured for an additional 12 h with [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) before being harvested. The T-cell differentiation assay was performed by culturing 5 × 106 naive lymphocytes with 1 × 106 irradiated allogeneic or autologous LPS-treated DCs generated in the presence or in the absence of 8-Br-cAMP and pulsed with TSST-1 (100 μg/ml). After 5 days, lymphocytes were expanded for an additional 7 days with human recombinant IL-2 (10 units/ml). The production of cytokines was tested by flow cytometry. Flow Cytometry—For surface marker analysis, iDCs or mDCs were treated with the following monoclonal antibodies conjugated to FITC or phycoerythrin for direct staining: anti-HLA-I and anti-CD14 from Sigma; anti-CD40, anti-CD86, anti-CD1a, anti-CD83, anti-HLA-DR, CD54, CXCR4, and CCR5 from BD Biosciences. The cells were also stained with the corresponding FITC- or phycoerythrin-conjugated isotype-matched control antibody from BD Biosciences. For indirect staining, cells were incubated with an anti-CCR7 antibody (BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit Ig antibodies (BD Biosciences). After washing, cells were incubated with avidin-FITC (BD Pharmingen). All incubations were in the presence of 10 μg/ml human IgG to prevent binding through the Fc portion of antibodies. For intracellular cytokine detection, brefeldin A (5 μg/ml; Sigma) was added to the culture medium. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized by using a cytokine staining kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Intracellular IFN-γ and IL-4 were detected by using a double-staining technique and analyzed by FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). Western Blot and Kinase Assay—Total cell lysates were obtained in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. 50 μg of total proteins from each lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis proteins were transferred on a nitrocellulose filter membrane (Protan, Schleicher & Schuell) by using a Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad) and transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol. Membranes were placed in 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween 20 (PBST) at 4 °C for 2 h to block the nonspecific binding sites. For detection of phospho-p38 SAPK, phospho-ERK-1/2, IκBα, tubulin, phospho-CREB, c-Jun, Lyn, and c-Src-specific antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) were used. Filters were incubated with specific antibodies before being washed three times in PBST and then incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). After further washing with PBST, peroxidase activity was detected by using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). To carry out the kinase assay, 50 μg of protein cell lysate were immunoprecipitated using 50 μl of protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads conjugated with the specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunocomplexes were washed twice in the lysis buffer and incubated for 5 min in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 μm ATP) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; l Ci = 37 GBq). MAPK assay (p38 and ERK-2) were performed by incubating immunocomplexes at room temperature for 20 min in kinase buffer containing 4 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma). Immunocomplexes were boiled for 5 min and separated on 8 or 15% (Src-like kinases and MAPK assay, respectively) SDS gels. Autoradiography was done for 5–18 h on Kodak XAR 5 film. Immunoenzymatic Detection of Cytokines—TNF-α, IL-12, and IL-10 were measured by an ELISA developed in our laboratory using cytokine-specific capture and detection antibodies (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (monoclonal antibody 11 for detection of TNF-α; antibody JES3-12G8 for detection of IL-10, and antibody C11.5 for detection of IL-12). A standard curve for each assay was generated by using the corresponding human recombinant cytokine (BD Pharmingen). The concentration of cytokines in the cell supernatants was determined by extrapolation from the appropriate standard curve. Chemotaxis Assay—Dendritic migration was assessed in a 48-well chemotaxis chamber (Neuro Probe, Cabin John, MD) using polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes (Nucleopore) with 5-μm diameter. Chemokines and dendritic cells (50,000/well), both in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.5% bovine serum albumin were placed into the lower and upper wells, respectively. After 45 min at 37 °C, the membrane was removed, washed, fixed, and stained. All assays were done in triplicate, and for each well the migrated cells were counted in five high power fields. Electophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Total cell extract were prepared by using a detergent lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and Complete protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in detergent lysis buffer (30 μl/5 × 106 cells). The cell lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The protein content of the supernatant was determined, and equal amounts of protein (10 μg) were added to a reaction mixture containing 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 100,000 cpm of a 32P-labeled consensus NF-κB binding oligonucleotide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in a final volume of 20 μl. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and run on a 4% acrylamide gel. Autoradiography was done for 5–18 h on Kodak XAR 5 film. cAMP Does Not Affect the Phenotypical Changes Induced by the Exposure of Immature DCs to LPS—The ability of cAMP-elevating agents to trigger the differentiation program of human monocyte-derived DCs has been documented by several authors (17la Sala A. Ferrari D. Corinti S. Cavani A. Di Virgilio F. Girolomoni G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1611-1617Google Scholar, 18Wilkin F. Stordeur P. Goldman M. Boeynaems J.M. Robaye B. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 9: 2409-2417Google Scholar, 19Wilkin F. Duhant X. Bruyns C. Suarez-Huerta N. Boeynaems J.M. Robaye B. J. Immunol. 2001; 12: 7172-7177Google Scholar, 20Gagliardi M.C. Sallusto F. Marinaro M. Langenkamp A. Lanzavecchia A. De Magistris M.T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2394-2403Google Scholar). Here we investigated the effects of high intracellular levels of cAMP on the LPS-generated signaling. As expected, the incubation of iDCs for 24–48 h with 100 ng/ml endotoxin was associated with up-regulation of CD80, CD86, CD54, HLA-DR, and the de novo expression of CD83 (Fig. 1A). Addition of 8-Br-cAMP (200 μm) to culture medium did not affect CD86, CD83 and HLA-DR up-regulation but inhibited the increase of CD54 expression induced by LPS (Fig. 1A). Because the switch in chemokine receptor expression on DCs is crucial to regulate their traffic from the inflamed tissues to the lymph nodes (3Sallusto F. Schaerli P. Loetscher P. Schaniel C. Lenig D. Mackay C.R. Oin S. Lanzavecchia A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2760-2769Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of 8-Br-cAMP on this event. Immature DCs expressed low levels of CCR5 and undetectable levels of CCR7 and CXCR4 as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1B). Stimulation by LPS resulted in a marked up-regulation of CCR7 accompanied by a decrease in the levels of CCR5 expression. 8-Br-cAMP did not affect the LPS-induced modulation of CCR5 and CCR7 but induced, even when added alone, a marked up-regulation of CXCR4 (Fig. 1B, and data not shown). To investigate whether these changes were generated by variations at the transcriptional level, we evaluated CCR5, CXCR4, and CCR7 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 1C). Stimulation by LPS induced accumulation of CCR7 and CXCR4 mRNAs and, conversely, decreased CCR5 mRNA levels (Fig. 1C). 8-Br-cAMP did not block the LPS-induced modulation of CCR5 and CCR7 and increased the LPS-induced accumulation of CXCR4 mRNA (Fig. 1C). Finally, we verified the capability of DCs to migrate toward a chemokine gradient. As expected, immature DCs responded to RANTES but did not migrate toward SDF-1 and SLC (Fig. 1D). Upon stimulation by LPS, DCs acquired the ability to migrate toward SDF-1 and SLC but failed to respond to RANTES. DCs exposed to LPS in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP showed a higher capability to migrate toward RANTES, SDF-1, and SLC than immature or LPS-stimulated DCs. Therefore, the high intracellular level of cAMP, obtained by culturing DCs in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP, does not prevent most of the events associated with their typical terminal differentiation process, including up-regulation of costimulatory and HLA-DR molecules, de novo expression of CD83, and switch in chemokine receptors. cAMP Blocks the Release of the Pro-inflammatory Cytokines and Impairs the Ability of DCs to Polarize a T-cell Response toward the Th1 Profile—In response to bacterial endotoxin, immature DCs are able to release a complex mixture of immunomodulatory factors including cytokines, chemokines, and arachidonic acid derivatives (1Steinman R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 271-296Google Scholar, 2Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Google Scholar, 3Sallusto F. Schaerli P. Loetscher P. Schaniel C. Lenig D. Mackay C.R. Oin S. Lanzavecchia A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2760-2769Google Scholar). The relative amount of proinflammatory and regulatory mediators released accounts for the ability of mature DCs to promote inflammation or, conversely, to instruct the immune response toward a tolerogenic pathway. Thus, cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-12 favor local inflammation and Th1 response, whereas IL-10 attenuates the inflammatory response and blocks DCs migration to the draining lymph nodes (8D'Amico G. Frascaroli G. Bianchi G. Transidico P. Doni A. Vecchi A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Mantovani A. Nat. Immun. 2000; 1: 387-391Google Scholar). In our experimental conditions, stimulation of iDCs by LPS induced the release of TNF-α, IL-12, and IL-10 (Fig. 2A). The presence of 8-Br-cAMP resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-α and IL-12 secretion but did not impair IL-10 production (Fig. 2A). Of note, at low dosage (2–20 μm) 8-Br-cAMP increased the LPS-induced IL-10 secretion (Fig. 2A). Because IL-12 is a key cytokine for the induction of the pro-inflammatory type of immune response, DCs induced to mature by LPS in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP should be able to induce naive T-cell proliferation but unable to drive efficient Th1 differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated CD4+ naive T-cells with increasing doses of TSST-1 in the presence of fresh autologous monocytes or LPS-treated DCs exposed or not to 8-Br-cAMP. As expected, LPS-pulsed DC, but not monocytes, were able to stimulate allogeneic naive T-cells to proliferate, whether or not they were pretreated with 8-Br-cAMP (data not shown). On the contrary, the presence of 8-Br-cAMP modulated the capability of both autologous and allogenic DCs to polarize the differentiation program of naive T-cells toward the Th1 phenotype by decreasing the ratio of IFN-γ/IL-4-producing T-cells (Fig. 2B). cAMP Does Not Impair the Activation of NF-κB, p38, and ERK-1/2 Pathways Induced by LPS—NF-κB is a ubiquitously expressed family of transcription factors that control the expression of a number of genes involved in inflammation, immune response, and protection from apoptosis (22Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immun. 2002; 3: 221-227Google Scholar). In most cells types NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm bound to the inhibitory subunit IκB. Upon stimulation of cells with different agents, such as inflammatory cytokines, IκB is phosphorylated on specific serine residues, polyubiquitinated, and degraded through a proteosome-dependent pathway. The released NF-κB dimer translocates rapidly to the nucleus where it activates the transcription of target genes (20Gagliardi M.C. Sallusto F. Marinaro M. Langenkamp A. Lanzavecchia A. De Magistris M.T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2394-2403Google Scholar). To investigate if cAMP was able to interfere with the activation of NF-κB mediated by LPS, we performed an EMSA on extract from DCs treated with LPS in the presence or absence of 8-Br-cAMP. LPS treatment caused nuclear translocation of NF-κB and induced its DNA binding activity (Fig. 3A, top panel). The presence of 8-Br-cAMP did not affect the nuclear translocation and the DNA binding activity of NF-κB induced by LPS. The specificity of the protein-DNA complex was confirmed by a competition assay. Binding was competed by the addition of nonradioactive κB oligonucleotide (data not shown). To investigate further the NF-κB pathway, we monitored the level of the inhibitory subunit IκBα by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3A (middle panel), IκBα protein levels in the whole cell lysate decreased 30 min after treatment with LPS. Such a decrease was not affected by treatment of cells with the cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP. The reappearance of IκBα 120 min after LPS treatment is a consequence of the NF-κB transcriptional activity. Because 8-Br-cAMP did not impair LPS-induced accumulation of IκBα at later time points, we can conclude that the stimulation of the cAMP-dependent pathway did not affect the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. LPS has been shown to activate multiple signaling pathways in dendritic cells, including p38 SAPK and ERK (23Ardeshna K.M. Pizzey A.R. Devereux S. Khwaja A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1039-1046Google Scholar). Activation of these kinases is associated with their phosphorylation and can be detected by Western blotting using phosphorylation-specific antibodies. We found that the phosphorylated form of p38 SAPK and ERK accumulated within 30 min from the addition of LPS to the cells (Fig. 3B) and remained stable for the next 2 h (Fig. 3B). Stimulation of the cAMP pathway did not prevent these biochemical changes (Fig. 3B). To corroborate this finding further, we measured the phosphotransferase activity of ERK and p38 SAPK on an exogenous substrate. These experiments showed that 8-Br-cAMP increased the stimulation of ERK and p38 activity induced by LPS (Fig. 3C). According to these data, we found that the addition of H89, a selective PKA inhibitor, inhibited accumulation of phospho-ERK induced by LPS (data not shown). cAMP Prevents the LPS-induced Activation of c-Src and Lyn Kinases—A number of studies have documented the ability of the endotoxin to induce accumulation of phosphotyrosine proteins in macrophages (24Weinstein S.L. Gold M.R. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4148-4152Google Scholar, 25Stefanova I. Corcoran M.L. Horak E.M. Wahl L.M. Bolen J.B. Horar I.D. J. Biol.

We therefore measured the autophosphotransferase activity of Src family tyrosine kinases upon stimulation with LPS in the absence or in the presence of the cAMP analog. We found that LPS induced an increase in the activity of c-Src and Lyn which, indeed, was inhibited by the ad"

In yeast, this requires the DEF1 gene, the product of which forms a complex with the transcription-coupling repair factor, Rad26. However, whether Def1 is directly involved in RNAPII ubiquitylation has remained unclear. Here we report the establishment of a reconstituted system for studying UV-induced RNAPII ubiquitylation, which mimics the known requirements for this process in vitro. Using this system, we show that Def1 is indeed directly required for RNAPII ubiquitylation. Moreover, Def1 interacts with RNAPII in a damage-dependent manner. These results support a model in which Def1 interacts with RNAPII in response to DNA damage, recruiting the ubiquitylation machinery to enable its modification and subsequent degradation.

UV-induced DNA damage elicits a complex cellular response, which includes induction of genes required for repair, signaling to checkpoint proteins, and direct activation of various repair pathways (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). DNA lesions in the coding strand of active genes pose a particular threat to genome integrity and cellular survival, and multiple mechanisms have evolved to minimize the detrimental effects of such transcription obstacles (2Svejstrup J.Q. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The best studied of these mechanisms is transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR), 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, transcription-coupled DNA repair; RNAPII, RNA polymerase II; HA, hemagglutinin; YPD, yeast extract-peptone-dextrose.1The abbreviations used are: TCR, transcription-coupled DNA repair; RNAPII, RNA polymerase II; HA, hemagglutinin; YPD, yeast extract-peptone-dextrose. during which the transcribed strand of an active gene is repaired much faster than the nontranscribed strand and the genome in general (3Bohr V.A.

Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of TCR remains poorly understood but requires the protein products of genes that are mutated in patients suffering from the severe neurodegenerative disorder known as Cockayne's syndrome (5de Boer J. Hoeijmakers J.H. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The function in TCR of one of these proteins, Cockayne's syndrome B, is conserved from yeast to man (the yeast homologue is called Rad26) (6van Gool A.J. Verhage R. Swagemakers S.M. van de Putte P.

Another transcription-relevant response to DNA damage is ubiquitylation and degradation of RNAPII (7Ratner J.N. Balasubramanian B. Corden J. Warren S.L. Bregman D.B. J. Biol.

Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) uncovered an intriguing connection between TCR and RNAPII ubiquitylation in yeast; the TCR protein Rad26 forms a stable complex with a protein called Def1 when isolated from chromatin. Like yeast cells lacking RAD26, def1 cells are no more sensitive than wild type cells to UV irradiation, but DEF1 deletion dramatically exacerbates the damage sensitivity of cells compromised for nucleotide excision repair (i.e. rad16 def1 mutants are much more UV-sensitive than rad16 single mutants). However, in contrast to rad26 cells, def1 cells have normal rates of both TCR and general DNA repair. These data suggest that Def1 is part of a pathway that represents an alternative to DNA repair. Most significantly, cells lacking the DEF1 gene are unable to ubiquitylate and degrade RNAPII in response to DNA damage. Taken together, these data suggest that Rad26-mediated TCR and Def1-mediated RNAPII ubiquitylation/degradation represent interconnected but distinct ways of contending with DNA damage in active genes (11Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The appealing model that resulted from the identification and initial genetic characterization of DEF1 (11Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12Svejstrup J.Q. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) predicts that Def1 is directly involved in RNA polymerase II ubiquitylation. However, biochemical evidence for this idea has been lacking. Resolving this issue is particularly pressing because def1 cells also have transcription defects (11Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which raises the possibility that the effect of DEF1 deletion on ubiquitylation could be indirect. For example, Def1 might be required for the transcription of genes encoding ubiquitylation factors. Here we report the establishment of a reconstituted yeast in vitro system to study damage-induced protein ubiquitylation; we used this assay to show that Def1 protein is indeed directly involved in ubiquitylation of RNAPII. We also demonstrate the existence of a damage-dependent interaction between Def1 and RNAPII.

The lysate was adjusted to pH 4.5 with acetic acid, and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C.

The column was washed with 5 column volumes of the equilibration buffer before eluting the bound proteins in a linear gradient to 0.5 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.1. Myc-ubiquitin eluted at ∼300 mm ammonium acetate. Fractions containing ubiquitin were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl and stored at –80 °C. Def1-6HA and Rpb1-3HA were both purified using the same one-step affinity purification procedure. Yeast strains containing the tagged proteins were grown in 10-liter YPD cultures to a density of ∼2 × 107 cells/ml. The cells were washed in 500 ml of ice-cold sterile water, and the cell pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of extraction buffer (0.2 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.39 m ammonium sulfate, 10 mm MgSO4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol plus protease inhibitors). Cells were disrupted under liquid nitrogen using a SPEX Certiprep freezer mill (Glen Creston), allowed to thaw on ice, and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti45 rotor for 2 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and recentrifuged before being applied to 0.5 ml of protein G beads coupled to the anti-HA antibody 12CA5. The cell lysate was incubated with the antibody beads at 4 °C with mixing for 4 h to overnight. The beads were washed extensively with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. The HA-tagged protein was released from the beads by the addition of 5 mg/ml HA peptide (21Winkler S.G. Lacomis L. Philip J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Svejstrup J.Q. Tempst P. Methods (Orlando). 2002; 26: 260-269Google Scholar) into the above buffer and incubation at 30 °C for 15 min. Eluates were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. In Vitro Ubiquitylation—Yeast strains were grown in cultures of up to 10 liters at 30 °C until they reached a density of ∼2 × 107 cells/ml. For experiments with the temperature-sensitive mutant FW1808 (as well as its parent strain FY56), the cultures were then incubated for 1 further hour at the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) (or at the permissive temperature as control) before harvesting and preparation of extracts. For a comparison between def1, rad26, and wild type extracts, the cells were resuspended in saline, UV-irradiated (100 J/m2), and allowed to recover in fresh YPD medium for 1 h at 30 °C before preparing extracts. Whole cell extracts were prepared as previously described (13Kong S.E. Svejstrup J.Q. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For each 100 μl of in vitro ubiquitylation reaction, 200 μg of extract was incubated with 2 μg of Myc-ubiquitin, 1 μg of HA-tagged RNAPII, 1mm ATP, and 10 μm lactacystin in Ub reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, plus protease inhibitors). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h before being placed on ice and diluted with 200 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, plus protease inhibitors). 10 μl of protein G beads coupled with the anti-Myc antibody 9E11 were then added to each reaction, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C with mixing for 4 h to overnight. The beads were washed twice with 400 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer, twice with 400 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer with 1 m NaCl, and finally with Nonidet P-40 buffer again. Bound proteins were eluted by the addition of SDS-sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were loaded onto a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted, and probed with the anti-RNAPII C-terminal domain antibody 4H8, which recognizes the Ser-5 phosphorylated form of Rpb1, and separately with the anti-Myc antibody 9E10 to uncover total protein ubiquitylation. In the ubiquitylation assay using extracts from rsp5-ts (Fig. 2), the initial immunoprecipitation was performed with 4H8 antibody to immunoprecipitate RNAPII and the blot was then probed with 9E10 antibody to reveal ubiquitylation. Def1-RNAPII Co-immunoprecipitation—A yeast strain expressing a 6xHA-tagged version of Def1 was grown in 1-liter YPD cultures to a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. The cells were resuspended in saline, UV-irradiated, and allowed to recover in fresh YPD medium at 30 °C. 100-ml samples were taken at the time points indicated. The cells were harvested, resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Hcl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 0.025% Tween 20, plus protease inhibitors), and lysed by bead beating. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at full speed in a refrigerated microcentrifuge twice for 10 min. Equal amounts of protein were added to 10 μl of anti-HA-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) and incubated with mixing, at 4 °C for at least 4 h. The beads were washed four times with 400 μl of lysis buffer followed by washing twice in 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Bound proteins were eluted by the addition of SDS-sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were loaded onto a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted, and probed with the anti-RNAPII C-terminal domain antibody 4H8, to reveal co-immunoprecipitated RNA polymerase, and 12CA5, to reveal the amount of Def1 precipitated. Reconstitution of RNAPII Ubiquitylation in Vitro—Our previous studies showed that nucleotide excision repair and RNAPII transcription can be faithfully reconstituted in vitro using crude cell-free yeast extracts. During preparation, these extracts are effectively depleted for nucleic acids so that no transcription or translation can take place (13Kong S.E. Svejstrup J.Q. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For the preparation of extract to reconstitute RNAPII ubiquitylation in vitro, cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase and UV-irradiated prior to cell disruption (see “Materials and Methods” for details). Using such extracts in combination with recombinant Myc-tagged ubiquitin (endogenous ubiquitin is removed in the course of extract preparation) and highly purified HA-tagged RNAPII enabled us to establish an in vitro system for the study of RNAPII ubiquitylation (Fig. 1). RNAPII ubiquitylation in this reconstituted system required the addition of ATP and ubiquitin (Fig. 1B), and the ubiquitin chains conjugated to RNAPII in the extracts grew longer with increased incubation time (Fig. 1C) as expected. Even though UV irradiation of cells prior to extract preparations was routinely employed, this did not appear to be strictly required for the ubiquitylation activity of the extracts. Most of the experiments described under “Materials and Methods” were done with an incubation time during which only one or a few ubiquitin molecules could be conjugated to RNAPII. We conclude that ubiquitylation of RNAPII can be reconstituted in a cell-free system in vitro. Ubiquitylation in Vitro Requires Rsp5 Ubiquitin Ligase Activity—It was important to establish whether the in vitro ubiquitylation reaction faithfully reconstitutes the key aspects of the reaction as it occurs in living cells. In yeast, the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 is required for UV-induced ubiquitylation and degradation of RNAPII (9Beaudenon S.L. Huacani M.R. Wang G. McDonnell D.P. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Extracts were therefore prepared from wild type cells and from cells expressing a temperature-sensitive allele of RSP5 (rsp5-ts), respectively. These extracts were then used in RNAPII ubiquitylation reactions in vitro (Fig. 2). ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent RNAPII ubiquitylation occurred in both wild type and rsp5-ts extract at the permissive temperature (Fig. 2, upper panel). By contrast, a dramatic difference in the efficiency of ubiquitylation was observed at 37 °C. Wild type extracts maintained the ability to ubiquitylate RNAPII, whereas only little modification was observed in rsp5 extracts (Fig. 2, lower panel). These results demonstrate that Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase activity is required for UV-induced RNAPII modification also in the reconstituted in vitro reaction. Ubiquitylation in Vitro Requires Def1—Having established that the ubiquitylation system can indeed be used to reconstitute aspects of RNAPII ubiquitylation in vitro, we next investigated whether Def1 protein is directly required for this activity (Fig. 3). Previous data obtained with live cells had shown that DEF1, but not RAD26, is required for damage-induced RNAPII ubiquitylation and degradation, but whether the involvement of Def1 was direct was not assessed (11Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Extracts from wild type, def1, and rad26 strains were prepared, and RNAPII ubiquitylation was compared (Fig. 3A). Extracts from wild type and rad26 cells supported robust ubiquitylation of RNAPII, whereas little, if any, RNAPII ubiquitylation was observed in def1 extracts (Fig. 3A, upper panel; compare lanes 3, 4, and 5). Importantly, the failure to ubiquitylate RNAPII in def1 extracts was not due to a general deficiency in protein ubiquitylation in the extract, as other proteins were modified as efficiently in the def1 extract as in wild type and rad26 extracts (Fig. 3A, lower panel). This indicates that Def1 is specifically required for ubiquitylation of RNAPII. Although these results clearly support the idea that Def1 is directly involved in RNAPII ubiquitylation, direct evidence for this conclusion requires that defective ubiquitylation observed in the def1 extract can be rescued by back-adding purified Def1 protein. Def1 protein was therefore purified to virtual homogeneity from the soluble, DNA-free fraction of a yeast cell-free extract (Fig. 3B) and used in combination with the ubiquitylation-deficient def1 extract (Fig. 3C). Addition of Def1 to these extracts indeed recovered RNAPII ubiquitylation activity without affecting overall protein ubiquitylation (Fig. 3C, upper and lower panels, compare lanes 3–5 with lane 2), indicating that Def1 protein is directly required for modification of RNAPII. Def1 Interacts with RNAPII in a Damage-dependent Manner—The effect of Def1 on RNAPII ubiquitylation might conceivably be achieved through direct interactions with the polymerase. Such interactions might be constitutive, but they could also be induced by DNA damage. To examine these possibilities, cells expressing an epitope-tagged version of Def1 were grown to mid-logarithmic phase and UV-irradiated. Extracts were prepared at different times during recovery, and Def1 was immunoprecipitated. Finally, the presence of RNAPII in the precipitates was examined by Western blotting (Fig. 4). A low but clearly detectable amount of RNAPII co-immunoprecipitated with Def1 in the absence of UV irradiation (Fig. 4B, lane 1). However, a dramatic increase in the amount of RNAPII associated with Def1 was observed shortly after UV irradiation (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). As cells recovered after UV irradiation, detectable interaction between Def1 and RNAPII also decreased (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 4, 5, and 6). No immunoprecipitation signals were obtained from side-by-side control experiments with cells expressing untagged Def1 (data not shown). Only a small proportion of the total RNAPII within these extracts was precipitated by Def1 under these conditions (data not shown). These results show that Def1 and RNAPII interact in a way that is strongly enhanced by UV irradiation. The transient nature of the interaction in all likelihood reflects that the Def1-interacting polymerases subsequently become substrates for ubiquitylation and eventually degraded. The data shown here are notable for several reasons. First, they demonstrate that Def1 protein is indeed directly involved in RNAPII ubiquitylation. Our findings thus support the idea that Def1 interacts with RNAPII in response to DNA damage, recruiting the ubiquitylation machinery to enable its modification and subsequent degradation. The exact manner in which this occurs remains unknown, but preliminary experiments with purified Def1 and Rsp5 suggest that these proteins do not interact directly. 2J. Reid and J. Q. Svejstrup, unpublished data. In general, questions about the mechanism of action of Def1 await the development of a purified RNAPII ubiquitylation system, which is presently in progress. Second, the cell-free ubiquitylation assay used here is likely to be generally applicable for studying UV-induced protein modification. A mammalian cell-free system for studying RNAPII ubiquitylation has also been reported (14Mitsui A. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6054-6059Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Lee K.B. Wang D. Lippard S.J. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4239-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Because the yeast extracts we employ also support DNA repair and transcription under similar conditions (13Kong S.E. Svejstrup J.Q. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the procedure potentially can be used to more generally study damage responses. This is particularly attractive because of the extraordinary genetic tractability of S. cerevisiae, in which numerous mutants with defects in various repair and checkpoint pathways have been isolated. We thank Prof. Fred Winston for supplying the rsp5 temperature-sensitive yeast strain."
https://openalex.org/W2059253071,"Hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein 1 (HS1) is an F-actin- and actin-related proteins 2 and 3 (Arp2/3)-binding protein that undergoes a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation upon B cell antigen receptor (BCR) activation. Density gradient centrifugation of Triton X-100 lysates from B lymphocytes demonstrated that HS1 was translocated in response to BCR cross-linking into lipid raft microdomain along with Arp2/3 complex and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. HS1-green fluorescent protein was localized in membrane patches enriched with GM1 gangliosides and BCR in the cells treated with anti-IgM antibody. Colocalization of HS1-green fluorescent protein with BCR was also correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1. Interestingly a murine HS1 mutant at the tyrosine residues Tyr388 and Tyr405 targeted by Syk failed to respond to BCR cross-linking for either translocation into lipid rafts or colocalization with BCR within cells. Furthermore HS1 was unable to translocate into lipid rafts in a chicken B cell line deficient in Syk. Reintroducing a Syk construct into the Syk knock-out cells recovered effectively both tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation of HS1 into lipid rafts. In contrast, translocation of HS1 into rafts was normal in a Lyn knock-out B cell line, and an HS1 mutant at the tyrosine residue Tyr222 targeted by Lyn maintained the ability to partition into rafts upon BCR cross-linking. These data indicate that Syk plays an important role in the translocation of HS1 into lipid rafts and may be responsible for actin assembly recruitment to rafts and subsequent antigen presentations.

Immune response in mammals is initiated by coordinated recognition of foreign antigens through cell surface receptors on lymphocytes.

Wienands J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that BCR-mediated signaling events often occur in membrane microdomains or lipid rafts that are rich in glycosphingolipid and cholesterol (2Pierce S.K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 3Cheng P.C. Dykstra M.L. Mitchell R.N. Pierce S.K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 4Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts tend to select certain types of proteins and exclude others (4Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar), thereby creating a specific environment wherein a protein can be phosphorylated by local tyrosine kinases and may become prone to interact with other local proteins in the same local environment. In lymphocytes lipid rafts undergo frequent clustering and form membrane patches upon receptor cross-linking. Consequently the lipid raft-associated molecules often display asymmetric distribution. Many processes of membrane clustering appear to be dependent on reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton meshwork, which is associated with lipid rafts on the inner side of the plasma membrane (5Rodgers W. Zavzavadjian J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The actin assembly is also necessary for the maintenance of the integrity of lipid raft (6Gomez-Mouton C. Abad J.L. Mira E. Lacalle R.A. Gallardo E. Jimenez-Baranda S. Illa I. Bernad A. Manes S. Martinez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9642-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), the antigen transportation into endosomes following BCR cross-linking (7Brown B.K. Song W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 414-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and the formation of immunological synapses (8Jordan S. Rodgers W. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism for the recruitment of actin assembly to lipid rafts is unclear. Upon receptor cross-linking, actin assembly is rapidly initiated in lipid rafts in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner (9Harder T. Simons K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Interestingly BCR cross-linking also provokes translocation of BCR itself into lipid rafts in an actin-independent manner (2Pierce S.K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), suggesting that BCR in the rafts may trigger a signal transduction that ultimately leads to actin assembly. It is known that an early phase of the BCR-mediated signal transduction involves activation of several non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases including Lyn and Syk, thereby resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple intracellular proteins (10Kurosaki T. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 515-527PubMed Google Scholar). One of the prominent phosphorylated proteins upon BCR cross-linking is HS1, which is expressed exclusively in cells of hematopoietic and lymphoid origins (11Kitamura D. Kaneko H. Miyagoe Y. Ariyasu T. Watanabe T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9367-9379PubMed Google Scholar). HS1 is structurally related to cortactin, a cortical actin-associated protein that is expressed in most adherent cells and implicated in the actin assembly mediated by Arp2/3 complex (12Uruno T. Liu J. Li Y. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26086-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Like cortactin, HS1 contains a characteristic repeated domain comprised of three and one-half 37-amino acid repeat units, a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain at the C terminus, and an Arp2/3 binding domain at the N terminus (Fig. 1A). Our recent study has demonstrated that HS1 promotes actin assembly and branching by binding to both Arp2/3 complex and F-actin (13Uruno T. Zhang P. Liu J. Hao J.J. Zhan X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A pathological significance of HS1 binding to F-actin has been indicated in a recent report that aberrant expression of an HS1 mutant lacking a functional domain for F-actin binding is genetically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease characterized by the activation of autoreactive B lymphocytes (14Sawabe T. Horiuchi T. Koga R. Tsukamoto H. Kojima T. Harashima S. Kikuchi Y. Otsuka J. Mitoma H. Yoshizawa S. Niho Y. Watanabe T. Genes Immun. 2003; 4: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Studies with HS1 knock-out mice, which displayed a defect in antigen-induced clonal expansion and lymphocyte deletion (15Taniuchi I. Kitamura D. Maekawa Y. Fukuda T. Kishi H. Watanabe T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3664-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), demonstrated that HS1 is intimately implicated in BCR and T cell receptor signalings. There is also evidence showing that HS1 is required for the apoptotic response to BCR cross-linking because B cells with low levels of HS1 expression are apparently resistant to apoptosis (16Fukuda T. Kitamura D. Taniuchi I. Maekawa Y. Benhamou L.E. Sarthou P. Watanabe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7302-7306Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism for the function of HS1 in BCR signaling remains to be established. Biochemical studies have established HS1 as a prominent substrate of protein-tyrosine kinases Syk and Src family proteins including Lyn, Fgr, Fyn, and Lck (17Yamanashi Y. Okada M. Semba T. Yamori T.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Direct association of HS1 with Lyn or Lck is evident in T and B lymphocytes and erythroid cells during the differentiation mediated by erythropoietin (21Takemoto Y. Sato M. Furuta M. Hashimoto Y. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1699-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Takemoto Y. Furuta M. Li X.K. Strong-Sparks W.J. Hashimoto Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7887-7893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A complex of HS1 and Lck with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 virions was also reported (24Ott D.E. Coren L.V. Johnson D.G. Kane B.P. Sowder R.C. Kim Y.D. Fisher R.J. Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Henderson L.E. Virology. 2000; 266: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although HS1 can be targeted by multiple tyrosine kinases, phosphorylation of HS1 at a full level requires a sequential and coordinated process involving Syk and Src. Phosphorylation is first initiated by Syk at Tyr388/Tyr405 in murine HS1 or Tyr378/Tyr397 in human HS1 and subsequently by Src-related kinases at Tyr222, presumably due to an enhanced interaction between phosphorylated HS1 and the SH2 domain of Src kinases (20Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Takemoto Y. Sato M. Furuta M. Hashimoto Y. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1699-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of HS1 phosphorylation has not yet been illustrated. In this study, we show that HS1 was recruited along with Arp2/3 complex and WASP into lipid rafts and associated with BCR upon BCR cross-linking in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. We also show that the process of HS1 translocation into lipid rafts requires Syk and its mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, our data imply that tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 mediated by Syk may be an important mechanism to induce actin assembly within lipid rafts in response to antigen stimulation. Cell Lines and Antibodies—Immature mouse B cell line WEHI-231 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Chicken DT40, DT40Syk-/-, and DT40Lyn-/- cells were provided by Dr. Tomohiro Kurosaki (Kansai Medical University, Moriguchi, Japan). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and penicillin-streptomycin. Rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to mouse HS1 was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 306-320. Mouse anti-HS1 monoclonal antibody was from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada). Lyn, CD71 (H-300), and histone H1 (AE-4) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-WASP and phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). TRITC-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 fragment anti-mouse IgM, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 fragment anti-mouse IgM, and peroxidase-conjugated Affini-Pure F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgM were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). All anti-IgM antibodies are specifically against the μ chain. Goat anti-mouse IgM and IgG antibodies were from Sigma. Cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit conjugated with peroxidase was from Sigma, and TRITC-CTB conjugate was from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Goat anti-chicken IgM antibodies were from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). Plasmid Constructions—Plasmid pHJ117, which encodes HS1-GFP, was prepared by PCR. Briefly a murine HS1 cDNA clone from ATCC was used as the template in PCR using CCGGAATTCATGTGGAAGTCTGTAGTGGGGC and CGCGGATCCAGGAGCTTGACATAGTTTG CAGG (EcoRI and BamHI sites are underlined) as primers. The resulting PCR product was inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). To prepare virus HS1-GFP, the EcoRI-NotI fragment of HS1-GFP from pHJ117 was inserted into the EcoRI and NotI sites of retroviral vector MGIN (a gift of Dr. Robert Hawley, Holland Laboratory), resulting in plasmid pHJ124. To prepare pHJ133 encoding HS1Y388F/Y405F-GFP, point mutations at Y388F and Y405F were generated using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) based on pHJ117. The resulting DNA fragment was inserted into the EcoRI and NotI sites of MGIN. Plasmid pHJ172, which encodes human Syk tagged by red fluorescent protein (RFP) at its C terminus, was prepared by PCR using pCDNA3.1-Syk (a gift of Dr. Susette C. Mueller) as the template and CCGGAATTCATGGCCAGCAGCGGCATGGC and CGCGGATCCCGGTTCACCACGTCATAGTAGTA (EcoRI and BamHI sites are underlined) as primers. The resulting PCR product was inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pDsRed-Express-N1 (Clontech). The EcoRINotI fragment encoding Syk-RFP was isolated from pHJ172 and further inserted into the EcoRI and NotI sites of retroviral vector MGIN, resulting in plasmid pHJ179. Virus Preparation and Viral Infection—Retrovirus-packaging cells (293GPG) were the gift of Dr. Richard C. Mulligan, Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, antibiotics, 2 μg/ml puromycin, and 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Packaging cells (1 × 106) were transfected with pHJ124 or pHJ133 using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). To harvest viruses, the transfectants were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 mml-glutamine. The medium of the transfectants was collected at 48, 72, and 96 h after transfection and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Gelman Sciences, Ann Harbor, MI). The virus medium was stored at -70 °C. For viral infection, WEHI-231 cells or DT40 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 in 35-mm dishes. On the next day, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh medium containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene and 1 ml of viral supernatant. After 24 h of incubation, the culture medium was changed to the same fresh medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 for WEHI-231 cells or 2 mg/ml G418 for DT40 cells. Expression of GFP proteins was verified by fluorescence microscopy. To increase the efficiency of infection, the cells were infected with the same viruses for two or three times. After 2 weeks of selection in the medium containing G418, the cells were sorted in a fluorescence-activated cell sorting system (BD Biosciences) according to light scatter and fluorescence intensity. To express human Syk into DT40Syk-/- cells bearing HS1-GFP, the cells were reinfected with the virus pHJ179. Expression of Syk-RFP was verified by fluorescence microscopy and Western blot. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells (1 × 107) to be analyzed were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), suspended in 1 ml of a serum-free medium, and treated with 20 μg/ml anti-IgM antibodies at 37 °C. After incubation for the times as indicated, the cells were mixed with 6 ml of ice-cold PBS. Following one wash with cold PBS, cells were lysed in 500 μl of TNE buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged briefly to remove insoluble materials. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with protein G-Sepharose coupled with HS1 monoclonal antibody or GFP monoclonal antibody. In some experiments, immunoprecipitation was performed with protein A-Sepharose coupled with appropriate polyclonal antibodies. The immunoprecipitates and aliquots of cell lysates were resolved by 10% (v/v) SDS-PAGE, transferred to Millipore Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted using appropriate primary antibodies followed by secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Bio-Rad). Blots were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography. Gel quantification was performed based on analysis of scanned blot images using Scion Image software. Lipid Raft Isolation—Lipid rafts were isolated by lysis of cells in Triton X-100 followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously (3Cheng P.C. Dykstra M.L. Mitchell R.N. Pierce S.K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In brief, WEHI-231 or DT40 cells (1 × 108) in 10 ml of growth medium were stimulated with goat anti-IgM antibody (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 5 or 15 min. The treated cells were collected and lysed for 30 min on ice in TNE buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and cellular debris. All procedures were performed on ice. The clarified supernatants were diluted 1:1 with 85% sucrose in TNE buffer, and 2 ml of the solution was layered at the bottom of a Beckman 14 × 89-mm centrifuge tube. The lysate was then overlaid with 6 ml of 35% sucrose and 4 ml of 5% sucrose in TNE buffer. The samples were centrifuged at 38,500 rpm in an SW41 rotor for 18-20hat4 °C. Twelve fractions of 1 ml each were collected from the top of the gradient after centrifugation. Aliquots of each fraction with the same volume were resolved by 10% (v/v) SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. In some experiments, the blot membrane was stripped and reblotted with antibodies as indicated. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—To analyze colocalization of HS1-GFP or HS1Y388F/Y405F-GFP with GM1, cells grown at log phase were stained with 25 μg/ml TRITC-CTB for 20 min on ice and centrifuged briefly to remove unbound reagents. The pellets were resuspended in a serum-free medium and then incubated with 20 μg/ml anti-IgM antibodies at 37 °C for 5 min. The stimulated cells was washed once with cold PBS, resuspended in 50 μl of cold PBS, and placed on ice. Before microscopic inspection, 5 μl of the cell samples was transferred to a glass slide, covered with a glass coverslip, and inspected under a confocal microscope. The images captured by the digital camera on the microscope were further processed with Adobe Photoshop software. To analyze colocalization of HS1-GFP or HS1Y388F/Y405F-GFP with BCR, cells grown at log phase were stimulated by addition of 25 μg/ml TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM followed by incubation at 37 °C for the times as indicated. For the time point at 0, cells were placed on ice for 5 min and incubated with TRITC-anti-IgM antibody on ice without shifting to 37 °C. The stimulated cells were washed once with cold PBS, resuspended in 50 μl of cold PBS, and examined as above. HS1 Is Cotranslocated into Lipid Rafts with Arp2/3 Complex and WASP—In an effort to explore the signaling pathway in which HS1 is involved, we examined the potential of HS1 to associate with lipid rafts of WEHI-231 B lymphocytes. The B cells were stimulated with anti-mouse IgM (μ chain) antibody, which cross-links BCR on the cell surface and subsequently triggers a signal cascade to apoptosis (25Reth M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 97-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The treated cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, and the lysates were subjected to a sucrose gradient centrifugation (3Cheng P.C. Dykstra M.L. Mitchell R.N. Pierce S.K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Fractions of 1 ml were collected from the top of the centrifuge tube and analyzed for the presence of HS1 by immunoblotting with HS1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, left panel, most HS1 proteins in non-treated cell lysates were found in fractions 10-12 near the bottom of the centrifugation tube. These fractions are rich in detergent-soluble materials as well as cytoskeletal proteins and thereby referred to here as high (density) fractions. Small amounts of HS1 proteins were also detected in fractions 4-6 in which lipid rafts are normally located (4Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts in those fractions were verified by the presence of GM1 gangliosides and protein-tyrosine kinase Lyn, both of which are known to associate constitutively with lipid rafts (3Cheng P.C. Dykstra M.L. Mitchell R.N. Pierce S.K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Upon BCR cross-linking, more HS1 proteins were apparently partitioned into rafts as evidenced by a gradual shifting from fraction 12 to fraction 5. HS1 was also found in the fractions 7-9 between high density and raft fractions of the stimulated cells. In contrast, CD71, the receptor for transferrin that is known to be a non-raft-associated protein (26Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 27Shrivastava P. Katagiri T. Ogimoto M. Mizuno K. Yakura H. Blood. 2004; 103: 1425-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was predominantly found in the high fractions of the cells treated with or without anti-IgM antibody. Trace amounts of CD71 detected in the raft fractions of non-treated cells may be caused by an incomplete solubility of membranes in the lysates, which might also explain the presence of some HS1 proteins in the raft fractions of non-stimulated cells. To ensure that the shifting of HS1 to the lighter fractions was not due to a nonspecific raft or membrane association, the same fractions were also probed with antibody against histone H1, which is not a membrane-associated protein. This analysis demonstrated histone H1 was exclusively distributed in high fractions of either stimulated or non-stimulated cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, the protein associated with fractions 7-9 may represent a transition form during the process of the recruitment of HS1 to lipid rafts. In addition to HS1, we also analyzed Arp2/3 complex and WASP as these molecules are also implicated in actin dynamics. Arp2/3 complex was detected by antibody against Arp3, a subunit of Arp2/3 complex (13Uruno T. Zhang P. Liu J. Hao J.J. Zhan X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Like HS1, these proteins were present predominantly in the high fractions of non-treated cells but also in the raft fractions of the cells treated with anti-IgM antibody (Fig. 1B). We also immunoblotted the fractions with anti-IgM antibody (μ chain-specific) to detect BCR. While there was significant BCR immunoreactivity found in lipid raft fractions in resting cells, a slightly gradual increase in the intensity of BCR bands in fractions 5-9 of the lysates derived from stimulated cells was evident, although the extent of the translocation appeared to be less significant than that for HS1. A previous report had described that translocation of BCR into rafts is more efficient in mature B lymphocyte CH27 cells than in WEHI-231 cells (28Sproul T.W. Malapati S. Kim J. Pierce S.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6020-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the association of BCR and HS1 with raft fractions in the lysates from CH27 cells as well. Consistent with the previous report, the translocation of BCR into rafts was readily detected in CH27 cells (Fig. 1C). Residues Tyr388 and Tyr405 Are Required for HS1 Translocation into Lipid Rafts upon BCR Cross-linking—To study the role of HS1 in BCR signaling in more detail, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 in WEHI-231 cells upon BCR cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 2, HS1 underwent a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation that reached a plateau within 5 min followed by a rapid decline and eventual disappearance in 2 h. The induction appeared to be specific for BCR cross-linking because no apparent increase in HS1 phosphorylation was observed in the cells treated with anti-IgG antibody (Fig. 2, right panels). This result is consistent with a previous report by others (17Yamanashi Y. Okada M. Semba T. Yamori T. Umemori H. Tsunasawa S. Toyoshima K. Kitamura D. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3631-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To determine the tyrosine phosphorylation status of HS1 in rafts, we analyzed by phosphotyrosine immunoblot the HS1 associated with raft and high density fractions of the cells with and without anti-IgM antibody treatment. As shown in Fig. 2B, a significant level of phosphorylated HS1 was found in a pooled raft fraction of the stimulated cells. Next we analyzed whether tyrosine phosphorylation was required for HS1 raft association. As a result, we prepared a GFP-tagged murine HS1 mutant where Tyr388 and Tyr405 were replaced by phenylalanine; these residues correspond to Tyr378 and Tyr397 in human HS1 that are targets for Syk protein-tyrosine kinase (19Brunati A.M. Donella-Deana A. James P. Quadroni M. Contri A. Marin O. Pinna L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7557-7564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The resulting mutant, HS1Y388F/Y405F-GFP, was introduced into WEHI-231 cells via a retroviral vector. The defect of this mutant in tyrosine phosphorylation was verified by phosphotyrosine immunoblot (Fig. 3A). While HS1-GFP was readily phosphorylated in the cells treated with anti-IgM antibody, HS1Y388F/Y405F-GFP failed to show any increase in its phosphorylation level in response to BCR cross-linking. To visualize the distribution of HS1-GFP variants in relation to lipid rafts within cells, cells expressing HS1Y388F/Y405F-GFP and HS1-GFP were incubated with TRITC-CTB for GM1 ganglioside staining and anti-IgM antibody for BCR cross-linking. The treated live cells were then examined by confocal microscopy. As a control, cells without IgM antibody treatment were examined in parallel. In most (∼75%, n = 300) non-treated cells, HS1-GFP displayed a cell peripheral and punctate staining (Fig. 3B, a and a′), a pattern similar to what has been described for cortactin in adherent cells (29Liu J. Huang C. Zhan X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A punctate staining was also seen with GM1 as detected by TRITC-CTB (Fig. 3B, b and b′). Some GM1 puncta were apparently colocalized with or in proximity to HS1-GFP puncta (Fig. 3B, c). After BCR cross-linking, both HS1-GFP and GM1 were evidently translocated into large patches in many cells (∼80%, n = 200) (Fig. 3B, d, e, d′, and e′) where their colocalization was more evident (Fig. 3B, f). In contrast, HS1Y388F/Y405F-GFP displayed a quite diffuse pattern in the cytoplasm either in most (∼95%, n = 200) non-treated cells (Fig. 3B, g and g′) or in the cells treated with anti-IgM antibody (Fig. 3B, j and j′). No colocalization of the mutant with GM1 was detected in patches under either condition (Fig. 3B, i and l). The lipid raft association with HS1-GFP and HS1Y388F/Y405F-GFP mutant was also examined by gradient centrifugation of Triton X-100 lysates of their overexpressors. As shown in Fig. 3C, both HS1-GFP and HS1Y388F/Y405F-GFP proteins were mainly found in the high fraction in resting cells. Upon BCR cross-linking, only HS1-GFP but not HS1Y388F/Y405F-GFP was shifted into the lipid raft fractions. These data indicate that lipid raft association requires functional tyrosine residues Tyr388 and Tyr405. Residues Tyr388 and Tyr405 Are Required for HS1 to Co"
https://openalex.org/W2072250637,"Taurine is present in high concentrations in neutrophils, and when the cells are stimulated taurine can react with hypochlorous acid (HOCl) to form taurine-chloramine (Tau-Cl). This compound retains oxidant activity and can affect the neutrophil itself or surrounding tissue cells. We have investigated the effects of Tau-Cl on MAPK signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Tau-Cl caused no loss in intracellular glutathione or inactivation of the thiol-sensitive enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, indicating that it had not entered the cells. However, stimulation of HUVEC with Tau-Cl (20–100 μm) induced the rapid activation of ERK within 10 min. This activation was abolished by inhibition of MEK by U0126, indicating that it was not because of direct oxidation of ERK. No activation of p38 was detected. These results suggest that Tau-Cl reacts with a cell membrane target that results in intracellular ERK activation. Tau-Cl over the same concentration range and time scale stimulated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in A431 cells and HUVEC. The EGF receptor inhibitor PD158780 significantly attenuated Tau-Cl-induced phosphorylation of both the EGF receptor and ERK. This implicates the EGF receptor in the upstream activation of ERK. The Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolol[3,4-d]pyrimidine had no effect on Tau-Cl-induced EGF receptor or ERK activation. We propose that Tau-Cl acts on an oxidant-sensitive target on the cell surface, this being either the EGF receptor itself or another target that can interact with the EGF receptor, with consequential activation of ERK.

Cells respond to oxidative stress through the activation of multiple signaling pathways that control responses ranging from proliferation and transformation to growth arrest, apoptosis, or cell death (1Guyton K.Z.

Critical signaling pathways involved in all these processes are the phosphorylation cascades leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolol[3,4-d]pyrimidine; Tau-Cl, taurine chloramine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolol[3,4-d]pyrimidine; Tau-Cl, taurine chloramine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (4Milligan S.A. Owens M.W. Grisham M.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 255-262Google Scholar, 5Jope R.S. Zhang L. Song L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 365-370Google Scholar, 6Lee K. Esselman W.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1121-1132Google Scholar). Oxidative stress also activates tyrosine kinases (2Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Google Scholar). The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is one such tyrosine kinase that is activated by various oxidants (7Zhang P. Wang Y.Z. Kagan E. Bonner J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22479-22486Google Scholar, 8Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Google Scholar). Although it is well recognized that reactive oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid, superoxide, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite can activate cell-signaling pathways, the mechanisms by which this occurs is not fully understood. One likely mechanism involves modification of reduced thiol proteins either through oxidation or nitrosylation. Oxidation may be direct or a consequence of changes in the redox state within the cells and may be regulated through antioxidant pathways involving glutathione or thioredoxin (9Dickinson D.A. Forman H.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1019-1026Google Scholar). However, despite intensive investigation of oxidant-sensitive processes, the critical targets have not been identified. Neutrophils are a major source of biological oxidants. When stimulated, these cells produce vast amounts of superoxide that dismutates to H2O2. The enzyme myeloperoxidase utilizes H2O2 and chloride to produce hypochlorous acid (HOCl) (10Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 3-15Google Scholar), a potent oxidant that reacts with a wide range of biological targets (11Prutz W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 110-120Google Scholar, 12Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 204-210Google Scholar), and is implicated as a cause of inflammatory tissue damage (13Pullar J.M. Vissers M.C.M. Winterbourn C.C. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 259-266Google Scholar). Thiols and thioethers are most readily oxidized by HOCl, and this oxidant also reacts with amino groups to generate chloramines (Reaction 1). HOCl+RNH2→RNHCl+H2O Reaction 1 Chloramines retain many of the oxidizing properties of HOCl, showing a high reactivity with thiol groups, and can oxidize thioethers and heme proteins (14Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Thomas E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6676-6772Google Scholar, 15Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Melton D.F. Thomas E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10404-10413Google Scholar, 16Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 572-579Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity of these oxidants depends on their structure and their ability to cross the plasma membrane (17Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 585-593Google Scholar, 18Thomas E.L. Infect. Immun. 1979; 25: 110-116Google Scholar). HOCl and small uncharged chloramines like monochloramine (NH2Cl) are readily permeable across cell membranes and are cytotoxic at low concentrations (15Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Melton D.F. Thomas E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10404-10413Google Scholar). Other chloramines, however, are much less permeable, and their toxicity varies accordingly. Glycine chloramine and histamine chloramine enter cells slowly and react with intracellular constituents (19Vissers M.C.M. Lee W.-G. Hampton M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46835-46840Google Scholar, 20Thomas E.L. Jefferson M.M. Learn D.B. King C.C. Dabbous M.K. Redox. Rep. 2000; 5: 191-196Google Scholar), whereas taurine chloramine (Tau-Cl; –SO3CH2CH2NHCl), which is charged and much less membrane-permeable, has low toxicity toward a number of cell types (15Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Melton D.F. Thomas E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10404-10413Google Scholar, 21Tatsumi T. Fliss H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1597-H1607Google Scholar, 22Weiss S.J. Klein R. Slivka A. Wei M. J. Clin. Investig. 1982; 70: 598-607Google Scholar). The formation of Tau-Cl and its low permeability are of interest for several reasons. First, it provides a model of a chlorinated oxidant that will be restricted to the outside of the cell, and therefore allows investigation of oxidant-sensitive membrane targets. Second, neutrophils contain high concentrations (20 mm) of taurine (23Fukuda K. Hirai Y. Yoshida H. Nakajima T. Usui T. Clin. Chem. 1982; 28: 1758-1761Google Scholar), some of which is released and becomes chlorinated when the cells are stimulated (15Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Melton D.F. Thomas E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10404-10413Google Scholar, 22Weiss S.J. Klein R. Slivka A. Wei M. J. Clin. Investig. 1982; 70: 598-607Google Scholar, 24Weiss S.J. Lampert M.B. Test S.T. Science. 1983; 222: 625-628Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that taurine is one of the physiological targets for chlorination by HOCl, leading to the generation of Tau-Cl at inflammatory sites. It has been proposed that Tau-Cl formation is a detoxification mechanism for HOCl, providing protection against neutrophil-induced cytotoxicity (25Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Melton D.F. Jefferson M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3321-3329Google Scholar). However, Tau-Cl is also a reactive oxidant, and more recent reports suggest that it can affect cell signaling pathways. It has been shown to inhibit activation of NFκB and production of NO, tumor necrosis factor-α, and other pro-inflammatory molecules in various cell models (26Barua M. Liu Y. Quinn M.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2275-2281Google Scholar, 27Marcinkiewicz J. Grabowska A. Bereta J. Stelmaszynska T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 667-674Google Scholar, 28Kanayama A. Inoue J. Sugita-Konishi Y. Shimizu M. Miyamoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24049-24056Google Scholar) and to induce cell growth arrest and activation of p53 (29Vile G.F. Rothwell L.A. Kettle A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 122-128Google Scholar). How Tau-Cl mediates cell signaling has not been determined. We and others have shown that HOCl and some chloramines are capable of causing proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in a wide range of cells (29Vile G.F. Rothwell L.A. Kettle A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 122-128Google Scholar, 30Vissers M.C.M. Pullar J.M. Hampton M.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 443-449Google Scholar, 31Englert R.P. Shacter E. J. Biol.

Gastroenterol. 1997; 25: 179-185Google Scholar) and that HOCl at sublethal concentrations is capable of activating ERK and p38 (33Midwinter R.G. Vissers M.C.M. Winterbourn C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 13-20Google Scholar). Given that many of the physiological effects of HOCl are likely to occur via the intermediacy of chloramines, we have investigated the ability of Tau-Cl to activate MAPK pathways in endothelial cells. We demonstrate that Tau-Cl activates ERK but not p38, and we provide evidence for the involvement of the EGF receptor in this process. Reagents—Cell culture media and supplies were from Invitrogen. Primary antibodies directed against anti-phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-p38, and phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), and anti-ERK and anti-EGF receptors were from Sigma. The MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)-specific inhibitor U0126, EGF receptor-specific inhibitor PD158780, and the Src family-specific inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolol[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) were obtained from Calbiochem. Complete™ protease inhibitors were from Roche Applied Science. Reagent HOCl was supplied by Sara Lee (Auckland, New Zealand). All other chemicals unless stated were purchased from Sigma. Preparation of Tau-Cl—Tau-Cl was freshly prepared on the day of use by adding 2 mm NaOCl dropwise to 10 mm taurine in PBS, with vigorous vortexing. Chloramine was monitored by UV absorption spectra (200–400 nm) to ensure the absence of dichloramine and unreacted HOCl (34Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Google Scholar). Tau-Cl concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using ϵ252 nm = 415 m–1 cm–1. Alternatively, the concentration of HOCl and chloramines was determined by reaction with 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid, and the change in absorbance was measured at A412 (ϵ = 28,200 m–1 cm–1). The 5-fold excess of taurine ensured that only the monochloramine and no dichloramine was formed. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from umbilical cords obtained with informed consent, harvested, and grown in M-199 media supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum and growth supplements as described previously (35Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512Google Scholar). Cells were used in the second or third passage after primary culture. A431 cells that have a greater EGF receptor density were utilized in some experiments. They were purchased from American Type Culture Collections (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cell Treatment with Tau-Cl—All experiments were carried out in 6-well plates containing ∼6 × 105 cells per well. Cells were not made quiescent by the removal of serum before treatment. Prior to treatment with Tau-Cl, cultures were washed three times with HBSS to remove potential scavengers of the chloramine. The indicated concentrations of Tau-Cl in 1 ml of HBSS was added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) Assay—Cells were lysed after treatment by the addition of 0.025% Nonidet P-40 in PBS and spun to obtain a cytoplasmic extract. GAPDH activity was assayed in an enzymatically linked reaction with phosphoglycerate kinase by following the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm (36Beutler E. Red Cell Metabolism: A Manual of Biochemical Methods. Grune and Stratton, Inc., Orlando, FL1984: 51-52Google Scholar). Reduced Glutathione Measurements—After exposure to the chloramine, HUVEC were derivatized directly on the plate with 1 mm monobromobimane for 20 min in the dark. Cell proteins were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (5% (w/v) final concentration) and scraped, and the precipitated protein was spun out (37Cotgreave I.A. Moldeus P. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1986; 13: 231-249Google Scholar). The fluorescently labeled supernatant was separated by high pressure liquid chromatography using a SPHERI-5 ODS 5 micron column (Brownlee Columns, Applied Biosystems, Inc., San Jose, CA) with a fluorescent detection system (excitation 394 nm and emission 480 nm) (37Cotgreave I.A. Moldeus P. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1986; 13: 231-249Google Scholar). The retention times and peak areas from the cell extracts were compared with a standard GSH solution, derivatized, and separated as above. Western Blotting—After treatment, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1.6 mg ml–1 Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 15 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Equal amounts of proteins from cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were probed with antibodies against dually phosphorylated ERK1/2, p38 (New England Biolabs), phosphotyrosine PY20 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), EGF-receptor, or ERK (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used to visualize the immunoblotted proteins through enhanced chemiluminescence. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford (Bio-Rad) assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed by lysing the cells in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1.6 mg ml–1 Complete™ protease inhibitors. Supernatants (200–500 μg of protein) were incubated with 1–2 μg of the indicated antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 16 h at 4 °C with rotation. After a brief centrifugation, pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in gel loading buffer. Proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Densitometric analysis of Western blots was carried out using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Low Cytotoxicity and Cell Permeability of Taurine Chloramine—To establish that the low cell permeability of Tau-Cl applies to HUVEC, the rate of oxidant consumption by the cells was measured, and the activities of GAPDH and the intracellular GSH concentration were monitored. GAPDH is a thiol enzyme that is particularly sensitive to oxidants, provided they can penetrate the cells (35Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512Google Scholar). Very little Tau-Cl was consumed from the medium during incubation with HUVEC, with 90% remaining after 1 h (Fig. 1A), whereas HOCl was consumed within 20 min. Little HOCl was consumed when cells were not present. Tau-Cl showed no cytotoxic effects at any of the time points or concentrations investigated, as determined by flow cytometry with propidium iodide (data not shown). Morphologically, HUVEC also appeared unchanged when treated with up to 500 μm of Tau-Cl. There was no membrane shrinkage, and the cells remained firmly attached to the plate. There was no detectable decrease in GAPDH activity (Fig. 1B) or significant loss of GSH (Fig. 1C) on treating the cells for 10 min with up to 100 μm Tau-Cl. This contrasts with HOCl, which under the same conditions causes 50% inactivation of GAPDH at 18 μm, complete inactivation with 50 μm, and 50% loss of GSH at 40 μm (Fig. 1C) (35Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512Google Scholar). The inability of Tau-Cl to inactivate intracellular GAPDH was not because of a lack of reactivity toward the enzyme. When HUVEC were lysed before the addition of Tau-Cl and then assayed for GAPDH activity, total inhibition of GAPDH activity was achieved with less than 10 μm chloramine (Fig. 1B). These results confirm the low permeability of Tau-Cl and its inaccessibility to intracellular targets. The lack of GSH oxidation also indicates that Tau-Cl does not affect the overall thiol redox state through transmembrane electron transfer. Tau-Cl Activates ERK—Various members of the MAPK family have been shown to be activated by cell-permeable oxidants such as H2O2 and HOCl (1Guyton K.Z. Liu Y.G.M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Google Scholar, 4Milligan S.A. Owens M.W. Grisham M.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 255-262Google Scholar, 5Jope R.S. Zhang L. Song L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 365-370Google Scholar, 33Midwinter R.G. Vissers M.C.M. Winterbourn C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 13-20Google Scholar). To determine whether the ERK and p38 MAPK pathways are activated in HUVEC treated with the impermeable oxidant Tau-Cl, the phosphorylated activated forms of ERK and p38 were analyzed. Activation of ERK was seen (Fig. 2A). It was significant over the concentration range 20–200 μm Tau-Cl and maximal, on average, at 50 μm (Fig. 2B). Although taurine alone at high concentrations has been shown to activate ERK in osteoblasts (38Park S. Kim H. Kim S.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1107-1111Google Scholar), we saw no activation of ERK in our system at the concentrations of taurine routinely used in our investigation (Fig. 2A). With 20 μm Tau-Cl, significant ERK phosphorylation was detected at 5 min, was maximal at 10 min, and returned to basal levels within 30 min (Fig. 3). HOCl has previously been shown to activate p38 as well as ERK in HUVEC (33Midwinter R.G. Vissers M.C.M. Winterbourn C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 13-20Google Scholar). However, when HUVEC were treated with Tau-Cl, p38 activation was not evident at any of the times or concentrations where ERK activation was observed (Fig. 2C).Fig. 3Time course of ERK activation by Tau-Cl.A, HUVEC were treated with 20 μm Tau-Cl for the indicated times. Cells were lysed, and the soluble fraction was blotted for phosphorylated ERK (top panel) or total ERK as a loading control (bottom panel). B, composite densitometric analysis of phospho-ERK normalized to zero time. Results represent means ± S.D. from five independent experiments. *, p < 0.05 compared with control using Mann-Whitney test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether Tau-Cl acts on ERK directly, cells were pretreated with U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK, the kinase directly upstream from ERK, before the addition of Tau-Cl. Activation of ERK by Tau-Cl was fully inhibited by pretreatment with U0126 (Fig. 2D), indicating that Tau-Cl does not act directly on the kinase but must have a target further upstream in this signaling cascade. EGF Receptor Phosphorylation by Tau-Cl—As Tau-Cl was not able to activate ERK directly and was incapable of entering the cell, a potential membrane target of Tau-Cl action was sought. One of the upstream signaling events for the activation of ERK involves the activation of the EGF receptor. To investigate the ability of Tau-Cl to activate the EGF receptor, the EGF receptor overexpressing A431 cell line was used. Activation of the receptor involves the tyrosine phosphorylation at multiple sites depending on the stimulus (39Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Google Scholar, 40Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar). Treatment of A431 cells with Tau-Cl caused an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (Fig. 4A) that was evident at 20 μm and maximal at 50 μm oxidant (Fig. 4B). With these Tau-Cl concentrations, no changes were observed in the levels of the immunoprecipitated receptor (Fig. 4A). In a time course experiment, phosphorylation of the EGF receptor occurred within 5 min of Tau-Cl addition, was maximal at 15 min, and maintained for over an hour (data not shown). Others have shown (41Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Google Scholar, 42Oliveira C.J. Schindler F. Ventura A.M. Morais M.S. Arai R.J. Debbas V. Stern A. Monteiro H.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 381-396Google Scholar) that activated ERK is capable of phosphorylating the EGF receptor. To determine whether ERK participated in Tau-Cl-induced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, A431 cells were pretreated with the MEK inhibitor U0126. ERK activation was prevented, but only a minor decrease in the phosphorylation of EGF receptor was seen, suggesting that ERK was not responsible for this effect (data not shown). To establish whether phosphorylation of EGF receptor by Tau-Cl preceded that of ERK, a specific EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD158780 was used. Treatment of A431 cells with this inhibitor dramatically decreased the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by EGF as well as decreasing base-line phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Phosphorylation of the EGF receptor induced by Tau-Cl was also suppressed by PD158780 (Fig. 5A). Western blotting with an antibody against the EGF receptor confirmed that the receptor band was present, so low recovery cannot explain the low phosphotyrosine reactivity. ERK phosphorylation induced by either EGF or Tau-Cl was completely abolished when EGF receptor activation was inhibited by PD158780 (Fig. 5B). Thus, Tau-Cl-induced activation of ERK appears to require prior activation of the EGF receptor. The possibility that EGF receptor activation occurred via the Src family kinases (6Lee K. Esselman W.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1121-1132Google Scholar, 43Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney J.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Google Scholar) was explored by using PP2, a specific Src family kinase inhibitor. PP2 did not inhibit ERK activation by Tau-Cl (Fig. 5C), implying that the activation of ERK by Tau-Cl is dependent on the action of the EGF receptor but is independent of Src family kinase activation. Similar results were seen when HUVEC were used, but due to the lower EGF receptor numbers the results were less pronounced. As shown in Fig. 5D, Tau-Cl treatment caused EGF receptor phosphorylation that was inhibited by PD158780, and PD158780 also inhibited ERK phosphorylation. In this study, we have shown that the cell-impermeable oxidant Tau-Cl can activate an intracellular signaling pathway. Tau-Cl activated ERK quickly and at low concentrations and also caused tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in two cell types. Tau-Cl has been shown by others (15Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Melton D.F. Thomas E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10404-10413Google Scholar, 21Tatsumi T. Fliss H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1597-H1607Google Scholar, 22Weiss S.J. Klein R. Slivka A. Wei M. J. Clin. Investig. 1982; 70: 598-607Google Scholar) to have low membrane permeability, and we have provided good evidence that it does not enter HUVEC. It did not alter intracellular GSH levels or GAPDH activity. The only Tau-Cl consumption seen was a small but consistent loss of about 2 μm immediately on adding to the cells, and the continued presence of the oxidant provided no obvious further stress to the cells. We propose that the initial small loss of Tau-Cl was because of reaction with extracellular targets, and oxidation of one or more of these was responsible for activating the signal responses. ERK phosphorylation was inhibited by U0126, an inhibitor of upstream MEK, indicating that a direct reaction between Tau-Cl and ERK was not responsible for activation. This is consistent with findings that ERK activation by other oxidants is also indirect (7Zhang P. Wang Y.Z. Kagan E. Bonner J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22479-22486Google Scholar, 44Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21003-21010Google Scholar). MEK inhibition did not prevent phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, which suggests that ERK was not responsible for this reaction, as has been observed with NO-treated cells (42Oliveira C.J. Schindler F. Ventura A.M. Morais M.S. Arai R.J. Debbas V. Stern A. Monteiro H.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 381-396Google Scholar). However, the specific inhibitor PD158780, which blocks phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, also prevented ERK activation. Activation of ERK and the EGF receptor occurred over the same time frame and concentration range of Tau-Cl. Taken together, these findings provide strong support for activation of the EGF receptor being the upstream signal for ERK activation (Fig. 6). Our evidence that Tau-Cl did not enter the cells implies that EGF receptor activation occurs by oxidation of an extracellular target. As shown in Fig. 6, this could either be a direct reaction with an accessible site on the receptor itself or a reaction with an alternative membrane target that enables receptor activation. Several oxidants including H2O2 and peroxynitrite induce the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, albeit at higher concentrations than Tau-Cl (5Jope R.S. Zhang L. Song L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 365-370Google Scholar, 7Zhang P. Wang Y.Z. Kagan E. Bonner J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22479-22486Google Scholar, 8Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Google Scholar, 43Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney J.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Google Scholar). In these cases, the oxidants do not appear to act directly on the receptor, but there is no evidence to suggest that they act extracellularly. Activation by H2O2 or peroxynitrite is inhibited, at least partially, by Src inhibitors (5Jope R.S. Zhang L. Song L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 365-370Google Scholar, 43Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney J.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Google Scholar). However, this was not the case with Tau-Cl, implying a different mechanism. Most interesting, activation by H2O2 results only in tyrosine phosphorylation and not the combined tyrosine, serine, and threonine phosphorylation that occurs with EGF (8Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Google Scholar). If this were also the case with Tau-Cl, it raises the possibility that a surface tyrosine phosphatase may be inactivated by oxidation. Although it is well established that various oxidants activate MAPK and other cell signaling pathways (1Guyton K.Z. Liu Y.G.M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Google Scholar, 7Zhang P. Wang Y.Z. Kagan E. Bonner J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22479-22486Google Scholar, 45Whisler R.L. Goyette M.A. Grants I.S. Newhouse Y.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 319: 23-35Google Scholar), specific mechanisms and targets for oxidation are not well understood. One proposal is that depletion of cellular GSH and alterations in cell redox potential affect the thiol oxidation status of signaling proteins (9Dickinson D.A. Forman H.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1019-1026Google Scholar). However, the lack of GSH oxidation makes this mechanism unlikely with Tau-Cl. Alternatively, there is evidence in some cases that inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases such as PTP1B, which contain oxidant-sensitive critical thiol groups, leads to increased phosphorylation of various proteins, including the EGF receptor (6Lee K. Esselman W.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1121-1132Google Scholar, 45Whisler R.L. Goyette M.A. Grants I.S. Newhouse Y.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 319: 23-35Google Scholar) and consequent signal transduction. However, this is also difficult to rationalize with Tau-Cl activation as phosphatases tend to be located and act intracellularly. Chloramines are relatively selective oxidants for thiol groups and methionines (16Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 572-579Google Scholar), forming disulfides and sulfoxides, respectively. Surface-accessible residues of these amino acids would be likely targets for Tau-Cl. The EGF receptor does contain external cysteine-rich regions, but these are considered to contain structural disulfide bonds (46Abe Y. Odaka M. Inagaki F. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Kohda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11150-11157Google Scholar). There are six internal thiols in the kinase domain that have been shown to be targets for thiol reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide, which block kinase activity (47Woltjer R.L. Staros J.V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9911-9916Google Scholar). A role for oxidation of EGF receptor cysteine residues in activation by Tau-Cl is therefore not readily apparent. Further investigation is needed to determine specifically whether the EGF receptor or other proteins contain cysteines or methionines at or near the cell surface whose oxidation is associated with receptor activation. A number of studies using human leukocytes, fibroblasts, and synoviocytes have shown that pretreatment with Tau-Cl decreases the ability of the cells to up-regulate production of inflammatory cytokines and messengers such as IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor, and nitric oxide (26Barua M. Liu Y. Quinn M.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2275-2281Google Scholar, 27Marcinkiewicz J. Grabowska A. Bereta J. Stelmaszynska T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 667-674Google Scholar, 48Park E. Schuller-Levis G. Quinn M.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4778-4784Google Scholar, 49Chorazy M. Kontny E. Marcinkiewicz J. Maslinski W. Amino Acids (Vienna). 2002; 23: 407-413Google Scholar, 50Marcinkiewicz J. Immunol. Lett. 2003; 89: 187-191Google Scholar). This may involve inhibition of activation of the transcription factor, NFκB (49Chorazy M. Kontny E. Marcinkiewicz J. Maslinski W. Amino Acids (Vienna). 2002; 23: 407-413Google Scholar, 51Liu Y. Barua M. Serban V. Quinn M.R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2003; 526: 365-372Google Scholar). The findings of Kanayama et al. (28Kanayama A. Inoue J. Sugita-Konishi Y. Shimizu M. Miyamoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24049-24056Google Scholar) that high concentrations of Tau-Cl oxidized a methionine residue in its inhibitor, IκB, and prevented IκB degradation support this mechanism. At first, this action appears contrary to the evidence that Tau-Cl does not enter cells. However, the experimental conditions used in these studies differ markedly from ours. Their Tau-Cl concentrations were about 10-fold higher; incubation times were much longer, and most important, the studies were performed in full medium. As the medium is rich in amino acids, chloramine exchange could occur to give more permeable species that are capable of reaching intracellular targets. Our results have implications for the physiological role of neutrophil-derived oxidants. Neutrophils contain about 20 mm taurine, some of which is released and able to trap HOCl when the cells are stimulated (22Weiss S.J. Klein R. Slivka A. Wei M. J. Clin. Investig. 1982; 70: 598-607Google Scholar). At inflammatory sites, taurine and amino groups on surrounding proteins are likely to be targets for the HOCl produced by neutrophils. Like Tau-Cl, protein-bound chloramines should be membrane-impermeable. Our findings suggest that rather than being protective, formation of these chloramines could contribute to the cellular responses to inflammation by activating the EGF receptor and the ERK arm of the MAPK pathway. In particular, they could contribute to the endothelial dysfunction seen at sites of chronic inflammation such as atherosclerotic plaques (52Podrez E.A. Abu-Soud H.M. Hazen S.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1717-1725Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that Tau-Cl activates ERK and that this is most likely a consequence of EGF receptor activation via oxidation of a cell surface target. The pattern of MAPK activation is different for Tau-Cl compared with HOCl and other oxidants, reinforcing the point that reactive oxygen species do not all have the same cellular effects. As individual chloramines differ in their reactivity and cell permeability, they may also elicit different cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W1971216691,"Activation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene transcription in response to all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) or a glucocorticoid such as dexamethasone (Dex) requires a distinct arrangement of DNA-response elements and their cognate transcription activators on the gene promoter. Two of the accessory factor-binding elements involved in the Dex response (gAF1 and gAF3) coincide with the DNA-response elements involved in the RA response. We demonstrate here that the combination of Dex/RA has a synergistic effect on endogenous PEPCK gene expression in rat hepatocytes and H4IIE hepatoma cells. Reporter gene studies show that the gAF3 element and one of the two glucocorticoid receptor-binding elements (GR1) are most important for this effect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that when H4IIE cells were treated with Dex/RA, ligand-activated retinoic acid receptors (retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor) and glucocorticoid receptors are recruited to this gene promoter, as are the transcription coregulators p300, CREB-binding protein, p/CIP, and SRC-1. Notably, the recruitment of p300 and RNA polymerase II to the PEPCK promoter is increased by the combined Dex/RA treatment compared with Dex or RA treatment alone. The functional importance of p300 in the Dex/RA response is illustrated by the observation that selective reduction of this coactivator, but not that of CREB-binding protein, abolishes the synergistic effect in H4IIE cells.

Extracellular signals received by eucaryotic cells are transferred to the nucleus where the transcription of specific sets of genes is modulated (1Levine M. Tjian R. Nature. 2003; 424: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The final targets of these signaling pathways are different combinations of transcription factors that bind to DNA-response elements and form various protein-protein interactions on gene promoters and thereby either activate or repress gene transcription. DNA-response elements in gene promoters often overlap or are adjacent to one another (2Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1131-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This provides various possibilities for the recruitment of transcription factors and their cognate coregulators in response to distinct signals and creates the potential for considerable flexibility in gene regulation.

Glucagon (acting through cAMP), glucocorticoids, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), and thyroid hormone activate PEPCK gene expression, whereas insulin and glucose are inhibitory (3Sasaki K. Cripe T.P.

O'Brien R.M. Mitchell J.A. Davis C.M. Imai E. Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2184-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Scott D.K.

Activation of PEPCK gene transcription by Dex also requires a multicomponent glucocorticoid-response unit (GRU), which consists of two nonconsensus glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites (GR1 and GR2) (8Scott D.K. Stromstedt P.E. Wang J.C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and four accessory factor-binding sites (gAF1, gAF2, gAF3, and the cAMP-response element (CRE)), which bind COUP-TF/HNF4, HNF3β, COUP-TF, and C/EBPβ, respectively (9Hall R.K.

A mutation of any one of the accessory elements results in a 50–60% reduction of Dex-induced PEPCK gene transcription in H4IIE hepatoma cells (11Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Any combination of the mutation of two elements nearly abolishes this response (11Scott D.K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Most interesting, RARE1 and RARE2 in the RARU are coincident with gAF1 and gAF3 in the GRU (4Lucas P.C. O'Brien R.M. Mitchell J.A. Davis C.M. Imai E. Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2184-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Scott D.K.

The respective transcription factors are present in about the same abundance in the H4IIE cell nucleus, and each binds with approximately the same affinity to these elements. Thus, it is of interest to understand how a cell responds to either of these inducers, whether different constellations of accessory factors and coregulators are used for each response and whether there is any functional interaction between the two units in the presence of both ligands.In this study, we demonstrate that the Dex/RA combination has a synergistic effect on endogenous PEPCK gene expression in both primary hepatocytes and H4IIE hepatoma cells. This response is most dependent on the gAF3 and GR1 elements. Upon treatment with Dex/RA, ligand-activated RAR/RXR heterodimers, GR, HNF3β, HNF4α, p/CIP, SRC-1, CBP, p300, and RNA polymerase II (pol II) are present on the PEPCK gene promoter. Notably, the recruitment of p300 and pol II on the PEPCK promoter is increased upon Dex/RA treatment. The important role of p300 is illustrated by the fact that its reduction results in a selective loss of the synergistic effect of Dex/RA, whereas a similar reduction of CBP has no effect.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids—The PEPCK·luciferase (PEPCK-LUC) reporter gene construct was made by cloning the PEPCK gene promoter (–467 to +69) into pGL3 basic (Promega), as described previously (14Stafford J.M. Waltner-Law M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3811-3819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The gAF1-Gal4 PEPCK-LUC, gAF2-Gal4 PEPCK-LUC, or gAF3-Gal4 PEPCK-LUC reporter constructs were constructed by replacing gAF1, gAF2, or gAF3 with a Gal4 DNA-binding element, as described previously (15Waltner-Law M. Duong D.T. Daniels M.C. Herzog B. Wang X.L. Prasad R. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10427-10435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). gAF1·gAF3-Gal4 PEPCK-LUC was constructed by further mutating the gAF1 element of gAF3-Gal4 PEPCK-LUC plasmid to a Gal4 DNA-binding element using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence of the Gal4 DNA-binding element is 5′-CGGAGGACTGTCCTCCGACCA-3′. gAF3αm PEPCK-LUC, gAF3γm PEPCK-LUC, gAF3Em PEPCK-LUC, gAF1-COUP-TF PEPCK-LUC, and gAF1-HNF4α PEPCK-LUC were made as described previously (15Waltner-Law M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10427-10435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). mGR1 PEPCK-LUC and palGR1 PEPCK-LUC were made by converting the GR1 element to a block mutation or palindromic GRbinding element, respectively. mGR2 PEPCK-LUC was constructed by replacing the GR2 site with a block mutation. mGR1/2 PEPCK-LUC was made by replacing the GR1 site in mGR2 PEPCK-LUC with a block mutation. The oligonucleotides used to construct mGR1, mGR2, and palGR1 were described previously (8Scott D.K. Stromstedt P.E. Wang J.C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). gAF1-cRARE PEPCK-LUC or gAF3-cRARE PEPCK-LUC was made by replacing gAF1 or gAF3 element individually with a consensus retinoic acid receptor-binding element (cRARE) (16Nakashatri H. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 890-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used to generate gAF1-cRARE PEPCK-LUC and gAF3-cRARE PEPCK-LUC are as follows: gAF1-cRARE, 5′-ATTCCCTTCTGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCAGGAGTGACACC-3′, and gAF3-cRARE, 5′-CGTCCCGGCCGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCACCACCTGACAA-3′. The sequence of all of the constructs was verified by DNA sequence analysis.Cell Culture and Transfection—H4IIE hepatoma cells were grown in stationary culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfection was performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (17O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 10 μg of a reporter plasmid (wild type or mutations of PEPCK-LUC). The cells were subsequently washed and incubated for 18 h in DMEM containing 500 nm dexamethasone (Dex) and/or 5 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) (Sigma). Cells were harvested by trypsin digestion and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was measured and corrected for transfection efficiency with Renilla luciferase activity using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega).H4IIE cells are transfected with <1% efficiency; therefore, a rat kidney fibroblast cell line, KNRK cells, was employed. These cells express abundant amounts of p300 and CBP and are transfected with ∼80% efficiency, as measured by the expression of enhanced green fluorescent proteins. They are therefore very useful in establishing the efficacy and selectivity of candidate siRNA molecules. KNRK cells were grown at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 5% calf serum, nonessential amino acids, and 4.5 g/liter glucose. These cells were cultured in 6-well plates for 24 h and transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). 2 μg of the siRNA vectors were transfected into 0.5 × 106 cells, and 0.5 μg of enhanced green fluorescent proteins were cotransfected as a control for transfection efficiency. Control cells were transfected with empty pSUPER vector. Cells were assayed for p300 or CBP expression 72 h after transfection by using Western blot assays of cell lysates. α-Actin was used to control for any differences in cell numbers or protein loading.Real Time PCR—Primary hepatocytes were deprived of serum overnight and then were either left untreated or were treated with 500 nm Dex and/or 5 μm RA for 4 h. Total RNA was extracted from these cells, and 0.5 μg of this was transcribed using 50 units of Taqman reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) and 125 μm random hexamer primers. Real time PCR reactions were performed on one-tenth of the reverse-transcribed RNA using primers specific for the PEPCK and cyclophilin genes. A 50-μl master mix of the following reaction components was prepared for each real time PCR: 18 μl of water, 100 nm forward primer, 100 nm reverse primer, 25 μl of 2× SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), and 5 μl (one-tenth) of the reverse-transcribed RNA. The sequence of the forward PEPCK primer was 5′-GAATCAGCCAGATGTAATCCCG-3′, and the sequence of the reverse PEPCK primer was 5′-CATTGTGCTTGCTGGTTTGC-3′. The sequence of the forward cyclophilin primer was 5′-AAGGTGAAAGAAGGCATGAGCA-3′, and the sequence of the reverse cyclophilin primer was 5′-AGTTGTCCACAGTCGGAGATGG-3′. The following real time PCR protocol was used: denaturation and enzyme activation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by a two-step amplification and quantification program consisting of 40 cycles of denaturation for 15 s at 95 °C and annealing/extension for 1 min at 60 °C. Data were analyzed using the SDS version 1.7a Installer software package.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays (ChIP)—H4IIE cells (1 × 108 cells per treatment) were kept in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for about 48 h. After a 2-h hormone treatment, protein-DNA cross-linking was performed with 1% formaldehyde in serum-free DMEM at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were then harvested into PBS buffer (ice-cold 1× PBS with protease inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, with protease inhibitors). After incubation on ice for 20 min, the lysates were mixed with 25-μm-diameter glass beads (MO-SCI Corp.) and sonicated (VirSonic; 2.5-mm tip) at 4 °C 10 times with 15-s pulses at a setting of 6 (output of 6 watts) to shear chromatin to ∼500-bp fragments. The supernatant from each sample was divided into aliquots for a subsequent 10-fold dilution in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, with protease inhibitors). Each sample was pre-cleared to reduce nonspecific background using 40 μl of a 1:1 protein A/G-agarose slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) supplemented with 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Stratagene) for 3 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The beads were then pelleted, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The precleared extracts were incubated overnight with 4 μg of the antibody or without antibody (as a negative control) at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Immune complexes were collected using 40 μl of a 1:1 protein-A/G-agarose slurry plus 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, with constant rotation for 3 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were pelleted at 1000 × g for 2 min and washed for 10 min at room temperature with 1 ml of each of the following buffers in succession: low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8), and 2× with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8). Chromatin complexes were eluted from the beads by two 1-h incubations with 160 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) at room temperature. The DNA-protein cross-links were reversed by incubating the samples at 65 °C for ≥12 h. The RNA and protein in the samples were digested using an RNase mixture (Ambion) and 50 μg/ml proteinase K, respectively. The DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and resuspended in 50 μl of nuclease-free water. Five microliter aliquots were used for each PCR or real time PCR utilizing primers specific for PEPCK or β-actin promoters. The forward primer used for the PEPCK gene promoter was 5′-GTTTCACGTCTCAGAGCTGA-3′; the reverse primer was 5′-ACCGTGACTGTTGCTGATGC-3′. The forward and reverse primers used for the β-actin gene promoter were described previously (18Duong D.T. Waltner-Law M.E. Sears R. Sealy L. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32234-32242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Real time PCR was performed as described above. The antibodies used for GR, RAR, RXR, HNF3β, HNF4α, PCAF, p300, CBP, SRC-1, and p/CIP were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-RNA polymerase II was from Berkeley Antibody Co. (Richmond, CA).Small Interfering RNA—The mammalian vector pSUPER was used for the expression of siRNAs specifically targeted against rat p300 and CBP mRNAs. The pSUPER vector consists of an H1-RNA promoter, which directs the synthesis of siRNA transcripts (19Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar). The target sequence of the p300 mRNA is a 21-nucleotide sequence corresponding to nucleotide positions 88–108 downstream from the transcription start site of this gene, which is separated by a 9-nucleotide noncomplementary spacer sequence followed by the reverse complement of the same 21-nucleotide sequence. The cloning of the sequence was facilitated by BamHI and HindIII flanking sites. This vector is referred to as p300 siRNA. The siRNA specific for CBP was made in a similar way by using a 21-nucleotide sequence corresponding to nucleotide positions 122–142 downstream of the transcription start site of this gene; the resulting vector is referred to as CBP siRNA.Western Blot Analysis—siRNA-treated KNRK cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. These cells were disrupted in a detergent lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm Na4P2O7, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 nm microcystin, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). A 40-μg aliquot of protein from each treatment was loaded on a 6% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). The membrane was incubated for 2 h with the appropriate antibody, followed by incubation with an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using the ECL immunodetection system (Amersham Biosciences). To assess the specificity of siRNA, the membrane probed with p300 antibody was re-probed with CBP antibody and vice versa.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test, with the significance level set at p < 0.05.RESULTSDexamethasone and Retinoic Acid Have a Synergistic Effect on PEPCK Gene Expression—Dexamethasone (Dex) and retinoic acid (RA) each induce transcription of the PEPCK gene in H4IIE hepatoma cells through some shared DNA elements (2Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1131-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Lucas P.C. O'Brien R.M. Mitchell J.A. Davis C.M. Imai E. Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Granner D.K. Proc.

This is not a clonal cell line (20Pitot H.C. Peraino C. Morse P.A. Potter V.R. Nat. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 1964; 13: 229-242PubMed Google Scholar), so it is possible that different populations of cells in a culture respond to each inducer. If so, the summed responses to the two ligands should be additive. To determine the effect of the Dex/RA combination on PEPCK gene expression, real time RT-PCR assays were performed to quantify PEPCK mRNA upon Dex and/or RA treatment. Cyclophilin mRNA was also measured as a normalization control. RA and Dex caused a 4- and 2.7-fold induction, respectively, and the combination resulted in a synergistic 13.3-fold effect in H4IIE cells (Fig. 1A). In rat primary hepatocytes, PEPCK mRNA is induced 15- and 7.4-fold upon treatment with RA or Dex, respectively. When both ligands are present, a much greater than additive 39-fold induction was observed (Fig. 1B). This indication of an effect on mRNA induction within a single population of cells was confirmed at the protein level in an immunofluorescent experiment performed on primary hepatocytes. PEPCK expression is induced in 71, 67, or 70% of hepatocytes upon treatment with RA, Dex, or Dex/RA, respectively (data not shown). Because more than 50% of the cells respond to treatment with either or both ligands, we conclude that there are no discrete populations of hepatocytes that respond to either Dex or RA or to the combination. Also, in keeping with the observations noted in Fig. 1B, the intensity of staining was greater in the cells treated with the Dex/RA combination (data not shown).RAR/RXR Heterodimers at the gAF3 Element Are Primarily Involved in the Synergistic Effect—The involvement of specific cis-elements and their cognate transcription factors in this synergistic effect was defined by using a number of variations of the PEPCK-LUC reporter plasmid, which contains the wild type PEPCK promoter from –467 to +69 ligated to the luciferase reporter gene. Upon treatment of H4IIE cells with 5 μm RA, 500 nm Dex, or a combination of the two, PEPCK promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene expression is induced 3.4-, 8.6-, and 16.3-fold, respectively (see Fig. 2). This greater than additive response is qualitatively similar to that noted in expression of the endogenous gene (see Fig. 1A); hence, this transient transcription approach can be used to define the DNA elements and associated transcription factors involved in this response.Fig. 2The gAF3 element is primarily involved in the synergistic effect. Mutations of PEPCK-LUC that replace gAF1, gAF2, or gAF3 with a Gal4 DNA-binding element(s) individually, or gAF1 and gAF3 in combination, were made. H4IIE cells were transfected with 10 μg of a reporter plasmid (wild type or mutated forms of PEPCK-LUC) and 100 ng of PRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase vector as a control for transfection efficiency. Cells were left untreated or were treated with 500 nm Dex and/or 5 μm RA for 18 h, and cell lysates were prepared for dual luciferase assays as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data represent the mean ± S.E. of five to eight independent experiments. Results illustrated are normalized to the basal activity of each PEPCK-LUC reporter gene construct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Mutations of PEPCK-LUC that replace gAF1, gAF2, or gAF3 with a Gal4 DNA-binding element(s) individually, or gAF1 and gAF3 in combination, were made to identify the involvement of these accessory elements in the synergistic effect. Results consistent with previously published data from our laboratory show that any single mutation of these three gAFs reduces the Dex-induced response by about 50%, and the mutation of both gAF1 and gAF3 abolishes the response (Fig. 2) (11Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). By contrast, the major effect of RA is facilitated through gAF3, although a small effect is mediated through gAF1. gAF2 is not involved in the RA effect, as noted earlier (13Sugiyama T. Scott D.K. Wang J.C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, gAF2 has no qualitative effect on the synergistic response (the total effect is reduced because of the decreased response to Dex), whereas both gAF1, and especially gAF3, have major effects (Fig. 2).The gAF1 element was converted to a consensus binding element for either HNF4α or COUP-TF which do not bind RXR (9Hall R.K. Sladek F.M. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In accordance with a previous observation, the presence of consensus HNF4α- or COUP-TF-binding elements at gAF1 decreases the RA-induced response by about 50% (Fig. 3) (7Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6260-6264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A significant synergistic effect of Dex/RA was not achieved from these constructs. However, the presence of a consensus RAR/RXR-binding element (cRARE) at gAF1, which excludes HNF4α or COUP-TF binding, promotes a significant increase of the RA response but reduces the Dex response by about 50% (Fig. 3). Nonetheless, the synergistic effect is fully supported when gAF1 is replaced by a cRARE (gAF1-cRARE PEPCK-LUC).Fig. 3cRARE at gAF1 restores the synergistic effect. H4IIE cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of wild type PEPCK-LUC or mutated forms of PEPCK-LUC in which the gAF1 element was replaced with a consensus binding element for either an HNF4α, COUP-TF homodimer, or RAR/RXR heterodimers. Cells were left untreated or were treated with 500 nm Dex and/or 5 μm RA for 18 h. Dual luciferase assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results illustrated are normalized to the basal activity of each PEPCK-LUC reporter gene construct. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of five to eight independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The gAF3 element includes two RAR/RXR sites, α and γ, separated by a 5-bp β linker sequence (see Fig. 4). An E box, which binds the transcription factor USF, is located immediately downstream (Fig. 4). The α and γ elements, and the E box, were mutated in the context of PEPCK-LUC to determine which component of gAF3 is involved in the synergistic effect. As expected from previous studies (11Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the E box mutation does not affect either of the Dex or RA responses nor does it have an effect on the Dex/RA response. A mutation of the α site slightly reduces the RA-induced response but has no significant effect on the Dex-induced response or on the Dex/RA-induced synergistic effect. By contrast, a mutation of the γ site of gAF3 significantly reduces both the RA and Dex effects and abolishes the synergistic effect of Dex/RA on PEPCK gene expre"

Heparin completely inhibited zero-length cross-linking of the 337-372 peptide to factor Xa but not to factor X. In the presence of calcium, factor Xa showed greater affinity for heparin than factor X. Studies using factor Xa mutants in which heparin-binding exosite residues were individually replaced by Ala showed that the R240A mutant was defective in recognition of the Lys36 cleavage site, generating the A137-372 intermediate with ∼20% the catalytic efficiency of wild type. This defect likely resulted from an ∼4-fold increase in Km for the A1 substrate because kcat values for the wild type and mutant were equivalent. Cleavage of the A1-A2 domain junction by factor Xa R240A was not blocked by the 337-372 peptide. Studies using mutant factor VIII where clustered acidic residues in the 337-372 segment were replaced by Ala showed that a factor VIIIa D361A/D362A/D363A mutant possessed a ∼1.6-fold increase in Km for factor X compared with wild type. However, similar Km values were observed for recombinant factor X and R240A substrates. These results indicate that the binding regions of factor X and factor Xa for A1 domain overlap and that both utilize acidic residues 361-363. Furthermore, factor Xa but not factor X interacts with high affinity at this site via residues contained within the heparin-binding exosite of the proteinase.

Factor VIII, a plasma protein deficient or defective in individuals with hemophilia A, functions as a cofactor for the serine protease, factor IXa, in the anionic phospholipid surface-dependent conversion of factor X to Xa (1Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Factor VIII is synthesized as a multidomain, single chain molecule (A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2) consisting of 2,332 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of ∼300 kDa (2Wood W.I. Capon D.J. Simonsen C.C.

Factor VIII is processed to a series of divalent metal ion-dependent heterodimers following cleavage at the B-A3 junction, generating a heavy chain consisting of the A1, A2, and heterogeneous fragments of partially proteolyzed B domains, together with a light chain consisting of the A3, C1, and C2 domains (2Wood W.I. Capon D.J. Simonsen C.C. Eaton D.L. Gitschier J. Keyt B. Seeburg P.H. Smith D.H. Hollingshead P. Wion K.L. Delwart E. Tuddenham E.D.G. Vehar G.A. Lawn R.M.

Factor Xa and thrombin convert factor VIII into an active form, factor VIIIa, following limited proteolysis at Arg372, Arg740, and Arg1689 (5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Proteolysis at Arg372 and Arg1689 are essential for generating factor VIIIa cofactor activity (6Fay P.J. Blood Rev. 2004; 18: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Cleavage at the former site exposes a functional factor IXa-interactive site within the A2 domain that is cryptic in the unactivated molecule (7Fay P.J. Mastri M. Koszelak M.E. Wakabayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12434-12439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cleavage at the latter site liberates the cofactor from its carrier protein, von Willebrand factor (8Lollar P. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10451-10455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as contributes to overall specific activity of the cofactor (9Regan L.M. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and Lys36 (11Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16502-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) within the A1 subunit. Inactivation after cleavage at Arg336 likely occurs by altered interaction of the A2 subunit with the truncated A1 (12Koszelak Rosenblum M.E. Schmidt K. Freas J. Mastri M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11664-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) coupled with an increase in the Km for substrate factor X (13Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1634-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the latter reflecting loss of a factor X-interactive site within an acidic residue-rich region defined by residues 337-372 (14Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Other proteases including activated protein C (5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and factor IXa (15Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown also to attack this site. Furthermore, cleavage at Lys36 by factor Xa has been suggested to alter the conformation of A1 limiting productive interaction with the A2 subunit (13Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1634-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus factor Xa represents a unique enzyme relative to factor VIII in that its catalytic mechanisms include both the up- and down-regulation of cofactor function. An interactive site for factor Xa in factor VIII necessary for activation has been mapped within the residues 2253-2270 of the C2 domain (16Nogami K. Shima M. Hosokawa K. Suzuki T. Koide T. Saenko E.L. Scandella D. Shibata M. Kamisue S. Tanaka I. Yoshioka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31000-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated recently that the 337-372 acidic region following the A1 domain, in particular a cluster of amino acid residues 361-363, contributes to a unique factor Xa-interactive site within the factor VIII heavy chain (17Nogami K. Lapan K.A. Zhou Q. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15763-15771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Factor Xa also interacts with these residues in the A1 subunit, possibly via the heparin-binding exosite of this protease (18Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and this binding modulates cleavage at Lys36 (11Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16502-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We now report on the mechanisms of interaction between the acidic region (residues 337-372) in the factor VIII A1 domain and zymogen factor X or proteinase factor Xa using a combination of approaches employing synthetic peptides and recombinant factor VIII and factor X mutants. Our results indicate that both zymogen and proteinase share a common interactive site in A1 that overlaps with a cluster of acidic residues at position 361-363. Furthermore, factor Xa but not factor X interacts with high affinity at the 337-372 sequence with participation of residue Arg240 of heparin-binding exosite in the proteinase. Reagents—Purified recombinant factor VIII preparations were generous gifts from Bayer Corp. (Berkeley, CA). The monoclonal antibodies 58.12 (19O'Brien L.M. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J.

Phospholipid vesicles containing 20% phosphatidylserine, 40% phosphatidylcholine, and 40% phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma) were prepared using N-octyl glucoside (21Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide corresponding to factor VIII residues 337-372 was prepared by Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. (Hopkinton, MA). Biotinylated peptide was prepared using sulfo-NHS-biotin as described previously (17Nogami K. Lapan K.A. Zhou Q. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15763-15771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The B-domainless factor VIII expression construct RENeo factor VIII and baby hamster kidney cells were gifts kindly provided by Dr. Pete Lollar. Proteins—The factor VIII light and heavy chains were isolated from EDTA-treated factor VIII after chromatography on SP- and Q-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (7Fay P.J. Mastri M. Koszelak M.E. Wakabayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12434-12439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The A2 and A1 subunits were purified from thrombin-cleaved factor VIII heavy chain by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Hi-Trap heparin column and a Mono Q column as reported previously (12Koszelak Rosenblum M.E. Schmidt K. Freas J. Mastri M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11664-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of the isolated subunits followed by staining with GelCode Blue (Pierce) showed >95% purity. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Recombinant Factor VIII and Factor X Preparations—Recombinant wild type factor VIII, as well as three clustered mutants, factor VIII341-345Ala, factor VIII347-349Ala, and factor VIII361-363Ala (clustered mutants in which Glu341-Glu342-Glu344-Asp345, Asp347-Asp348-Asp349, and Asp361-Asp362-Asp363 are replaced by Ala, respectively), were constructed, expressed, and purified as described previously (17Nogami K. Lapan K.A. Zhou Q. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15763-15771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recombinant wild type factor X as well as seven mutants in which Ala was individually substituted for heparin-binding exosite residues (R93A, K96A, R125A, R165A, K169A, K236A, and R240A) were constructed, expressed, and fully γ-carboxylated proteins were purified as described previously (18Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Chen L. Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recombinant factor X derivatives were converted to their activated forms (factor Xa) with RVV-X as described previously (24Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor Xa Generation Assay—The rate of conversion of factor X to factor Xa was monitored in a purified system (25Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 30 nm factor VIII was activated by the addition of 10 nm thrombin in the presence of 10 μm phospholipid vesicles. Thrombin activity was inhibited after 1 min by the addition of 2.5 units/ml hirudin, and the reactions were initiated with the addition of 0.5 nm factor IXa and the indicated amounts of factor X. Aliquots were removed at appropriate times to assess initial rates of product formation and added to tubes containing EDTA (50 mm final concentration) to stop the reaction. Rates of factor Xa generation were determined by the addition of the chromogenic substrate, S-2765 (0.46 mm final concentration). Reactions were read at 405 nm for 10 min using a Vmax microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Factor X Solid Phase Binding Assay—The direct binding assay was performed using a modification of our previously reported method (14Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All reactions were run at 22 °C. The A1 subunit (50 nm) was bound to the microtiter well in 15 mm NaCO3, 35mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C. After washing the wells with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20), each well was blocked in wash buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h. After washing three times, mixtures of 300 nm factor X and varying amounts of DEGR-factor Xa in wash buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin were added to the wells and incubated for 40 min. After several rapid washings, 30 nm RVV-X activator in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.2 m NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2, was added and incubated for 15 min. This was followed by the addition of the chromogenic substrate, S-2765 (0.46 mm final concentration), and the plate was read at 405 nm for 20 min using a Vmax microtiter plate reader. Control experiments showed that the RVV-X enzyme did not hydrolyze the chromogenic substrate. The amount of nonspecific binding of factor X to the blocked wells containing no A1 subunit was less than 5% of the total signal, and the amount of specific binding was obtained by subtracting nonspecific binding of factor X. Cross-linking with EDC—Cross-linking reactions containing the indicated concentrations reactants together with biotinylated 337-372 peptide were run in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20 at 4 °C for 1 h. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-electrophoresis sample buffer and boiling. Binding to Heparin-Sepharose—Factor X or factor Xa (50 μg) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20 was applied to a 0.5-ml heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the above buffer. The column was washed and protein eluted with a step gradient of 0.15-0.5 m NaCl using increments of 20 mm NaCl (1 ml/step), and 1-ml fractions were collected. The factor Xa elution position was determined after a 50-fold dilution of each fraction using the column equilibration buffer and addition of the chromogenic substrate, S-2765 (0.46 mm final concentration). Samples were read at 405 nm for 5 min using a Vmax microtiter plate reader. The elution position of factor X was determined using a similar method after the reaction of each diluted fraction with 30 nm RVV-X activator for 15 min to convert the zymogen factor X to active enzyme. Cleavage of the A1 or Isolated Heavy Chain Subunit by Recombinant Factor Xa—Recombinant factor Xa derivatives were added to the isolated A1 or heavy chain subunit at the indicated concentration in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20, and reactions were run at 22 °C. Samples were taken at the indicated times, and reactions were immediately terminated and prepared for SDS-PAGE by adding SDS and boiling for 3 min. Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed using 8 or 13% gels according to the procedure of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was carried out using a Bio-Rad mini gel apparatus at 150 V for 1 h. The protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed using the factor VIII monoclonal antibody followed by anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody. The signal was detected using the enhanced chemifluorescence system (Amersham Biosciences), and blots were scanned at 570 nm using Storm 860 (Molecular Devices). In addition, the biotinylated peptide was probed using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. The signal was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences), and blots were exposed to film for various times. Densitometric scans were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Devices). Data Analyses—All experiments were performed at least three separate times, and average values are shown. The Km and kcat values for factor VIIIa/IXa-catalyzed activation of factor X and factor Xa-catalyzed cleavage of A1 subunit were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation, with catalytic efficiencies expressed as the ratio of kcat/Km. Interprotein binding energy was calculated by Equation 1. ΔG0=−RTlnKd (Eq. 1) To evaluate the inhibition of the interaction between factor X and A1 subunit by DEGR-factor Xa, nonlinear least squares regression analysis was performed according to a competition inhibition model using Equation 2, %binding=Bmax·[factor X]Kd·[1+[DEGR−factor Xa]Ki]+[factor X] (Eq. 2) where Bmax represents maximum binding, Kd is the dissociation constant for factor X and A1 subunit, and Ki is the inhibition constant for DEGR-factor Xa interaction with A1 subunit. The apparent rate constants (k) for cleavage of indicated A1 subunit substrates by factor Xa were analyzed as reported previously (11Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16502-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The apparent rate constant values (k11, k12, k21, and k22) in Scheme I are based on the parallel and series reactions for intact A1 subunit cleavage by factor Xa and were estimated by nonlinear least squares regression using multiple equations as described previously (11Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16502-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). D1-D4 represent low levels of small degradation products that derive from the A1 substrates. Relationship of the 337-372 Acidic Region Interaction with Factor X and Factor Xa—The C-terminal acidic region separating A1 and A2 domains in the factor VIII heavy chain represents a common interactive site for factor X (14Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and factor Xa (17Nogami K. Lapan K.A. Zhou Q. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15763-15771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To investigate mechanisms employed by the zymogen and proteinase in interacting with this region, we first tested the capacity of DEGR-factor Xa to inhibit binding of factor X to the A1 subunit in a solid phase assay. The assay employed measures factor X bound to immobilized A1 subunit after its conversion to factor Xa by RVV-X and subsequent quantitation of the proteinase concentration by a chromogenic substrate (14Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that the binding of factor X to A1 subunit was of affinity (Kd ∼600 nm) similar to that reported previously (14Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mixtures with various concentrations of DEGR-factor Xa and factor X (300 nm) were reacted with 50 nm A1 subunit as described under “Materials and Methods.” DEGR-factor Xa inhibited the binding of factor X to A1 by ∼50% in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Because this is a nonequilibrium assay, the apparent Ki value calculated from fitting the curve (18.0 ± 2.0 nm) suggested that the interaction of A1 subunit with factor Xa occurs with an affinity value that was >20-fold that of factor X. We observed that DEGR-factor Xa failed to yield complete inhibition of factor X binding to the immobilized A1 subunit. The reason for this partial (∼50%) level of inhibition is not known but may reflect the presence of another factor X-interactive site in addition to the common binding site. Alternatively, this observation may reflect a limitation of the solid phase binding assay resulting from altered conformations in the immobilized A1 subunit and/or the nonequilibrium conditions employed. To address these issues, an alternate form of analysis was used to characterize the competition between zymogen and proteinase for interaction with the A1 subunit. Previous results from our laboratory demonstrated that the zero-length cross-linking reagent, EDC, mediated covalent linkage between a peptide corresponding to residues 337-372 of the A1 subunit and the heavy chains of factor X (14Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or factor Xa (17Nogami K. Lapan K.A. Zhou Q. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15763-15771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting that both proteins form salt bridge(s) with the peptide sequence. Thus, EDC was utilized as a complementary solution phase approach to study direct interaction of these proteins with this factor X/Xa-interactive sequence. Mixtures containing equivalent concentrations of factor X and DEGR-factor Xa were combined with a fixed concentration (40 μm) of biotinylated 337-372 peptide and reacted with 300 μm EDC as described under “Materials and Methods.” Samples of the reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, and bands representing cross-linked products were quantitated using densitometry scanning (Fig. 2A). Cross-linked products of 337-372 peptide with DEGR-factor Xa showed significantly greater density compared with factor X. At the maximum protein concentration employed (1.6 μm), reaction products containing DEGR-factor Xa were ∼10-fold greater than factor X-containing products. These observations were consistent with the results from the solid binding assay using the intact A1 subunit. Furthermore, the EDC-mediated cross-linking procedure was modified to a competition format to assess relative inhibitory activities of DEGR-factor Xa (or factor X) on the formation of cross-linked products of peptide with factor X (or DEGR-factor Xa). 500 nm factor X or factor Xa and 40 μm biotinylated 337-372 peptide were reacted with 300 μm EDC in the presence of various concentrations of DEGR-factor Xa or factor X, respectively. DEGR-factor Xa completely inhibited the formation of cross-linked product of factor X and 337-372 peptide (Fig. 2B, left panel). However, factor X showed little if any inhibition for DEGR-factor Xa and 337-372 peptide cross-linking (Fig. 2B, right panel). These data, taken together with results from the solid phase assay, suggest that both factor X and factor Xa interact with common region within the 337-372 region of A1 subunit, that this interaction is mutually exclusive, and that the proteinase form of the substrate possesses a markedly greater affinity for this site compared with the zymogen. Effect of Heparin on Factor X or Factor Xa and 337-372 Peptide Binding with EDC—We speculated recently that factor Xa may interact with the A1 337-372 region via its heparin-binding exosite (11Nogami K.

To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of heparin on the EDC-mediated cross-linking of the 337-372 peptide to factor X and factor Xa. 500 nm factor X or factor Xa was reacted with 40 μm biotinylated 337-372 peptide followed by the addition of 300 μm EDC in the presence of various concentrations of heparin as described under “Materials and Methods.” Products of the reactions were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A), and the density of cross-linked products observed was quantitated using densitometry (Fig. 3B). Heparin completely blocked the formation of cross-linked product comprised of 337-372 peptide and factor Xa in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 1.4 ± 0.2 units/ml). In contrast, heparin-dependent inhibition of the cross-linking between 337-372 peptide and factor X was marginal, yielding ∼65% of the control value for cross-linked product at the highest concentration of heparin employed (10 units/ml). These results support the hypothesis that factor Xa interacts directly with the 337-372 region via its heparin-binding exosite of the proteinase. The negative results observed with factor X also serve as a control for the lack of interaction of the peptide with heparin. The failure of heparin to alter the interaction of peptide with factor X would be consistent with a putative heparin proexosite in the zymogen. Alternatively, factor X may bind peptide by an unrelated mechanism. The disparate effects of heparin on interactions involving factor X/Xa with the 337-372 segment of A1 were consistent with differential affinities of the zymogen and proteinase for the proteoglycan. The affinities of factors X and Xa for heparin were evaluated by a NaCl gradient elution of the protein from a heparin-Sepharose column (Fig. 4). Factor Xa elution was monitored by amidolytic activity, whereas column fractions containing factor X were first converted to factor Xa prior to running the amidolytic assay. Factor Xa was eluted at a NaCl concentration of 0.22 m, whereas factor X failed to bind the column at 0.1 m NaCl and was recovered in the flow-through fraction. These observations indicated a modest affinity for factor Xa for heparin, whereas little if any affinity of factor X for heparin was determined under these reaction conditions. These results are consistent with heparin binding of factor Xa mediated through the heparin-binding exosite, whereas this site is not formed in the zymogen. Proteolysis of A1 Subunit after Reaction with Factor Xa Heparin-binding Exosite Mutants—Contribution of the heparin-binding exosite of factor Xa to its catalytic mechanisms involving the 337-372 sequence was evaluated further using two factor VIII-derived substrates, purified A1 subunit and the isolated factor VIII heavy chain. Factor Xa proteolytically inactivates factor VIIIa, cleaving the A1 subunit to a terminal product designated A137-336. This product may be derived via two pathways as identified by the intermediates, A11-336 and A137-372, generated by initial cleavage at Arg336 and Lys36, respectively (11Nogami K. Wakabayashi H.

https://openalex.org/W2113274097,"The decarboxylase/dehydrogenase (E1b) component of the 4-megadalton human branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) metabolic machine is a thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzyme with a heterotetrameric cofactor-binding fold. The E1b component catalyzes the decarboxylation of α-keto acids and the subsequent reductive acylation of the lipoic acid-bearing domain (LBD) from the 24-meric transacylase (E2b) core. In the present study, we show that the binding of cofactor ThDP to the E1b active site induces a disorder-to-order transition of the conserved phosphorylation loop carrying the two phosphorylation sites Ser292-α and Ser302-α, as deduced from the 1.80-1.85 Å apoE1b and holoE1b structures. The induced loop conformation is essential for the recognition of lipoylated LBD to initiate E1b-catalyzed reductive acylation. Alterations of invariant Arg287-α, Asp295-α, Tyr300-α, and Arg301-α that form a hydrogen-bonding network in the phosphorylation loop result in the disordering of the loop conformation as elucidated by limited proteolysis, accompanied by the impaired binding and diminished reductive acylation of lipoylated LBD. In contrast, kcat values for E1b-catalyzed decarboxylation of the α-keto acid are higher in these E1b mutants than in wild-type E1b, with higher Km values for the substrate in the mutants. ThDP binding that orders the loop prevents phosphorylation of E1b by the BCKD kinase and averts the inactivation of wild-type E1b, but not the above mutants, by this covalent modification.

The BCKD complex catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain α-keto acids (BCKAs) derived from leucine, isoleucine, and valine (1Chuang D.T. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Creighton T.E. Encyclopedia of Molecular Medicine. 5. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 393-396Google Scholar) (Reaction 1), R−CO−COOH+CoA−SH+NAD+→R−CO−S−CoA+CO2↑+NADH+H+REACTION 1 Genetic defects in the BCKD complex result in the heritable Maple Syrup Urine Disease manifested by often-fetal ketoacidosis, encephalopathy, and mental retardation (2Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Vogelstein B. Childs B. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1971-2006Google Scholar). The 4 × 106-dalton BCKD complex is organized around a cubic core comprising 24 lipoate-bearing dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2b) subunits, associated with multiple copies of branched-chain α-keto acid decarboxylase/dehydrogenase (E1b), dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), the BCKD kinase, and the BCKD phosphatase. The kinase and the phosphatase regulate activity of the BCKD complex by a reversible phosphorylation (inactivation)/dephosphorylation (activation) cycle (3Harris R.A. Hawes J.W. Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Sato J. Jaskiewicz J. Hurley T.D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 271-293Google Scholar). Reaction steps catalyzed by the three enzyme components, analogous to those elucidated for the cognate pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (4Reed L.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1974; 7: 40-46Google Scholar), are as shown in Reactions 2-6. R−CO−COOH+E1b−ThDP→E1b−R−COH=ThDP+CO2↑REACTION 2 E1b−R−COH=ThDP+E2b−[lipS2]→E2b−[R−CO−S−lipSH]+E1b−ThDPREACTION 3 E2b−[R−CO−S−lipSH]+CoA−SH→R−CO−S−CoA+E2b−[lip(SH)2]REACTION 4 E2b−[lip(SH)2]+E3−FAD→E2b−[lipS2]+E3−FADH2REACTION 5 E3−FADH2+NAD+→E3−FAD+NADH+H+REACTION 6 These reaction steps epitomize a classic case of substrate channeling in multienzyme complexes. The E1b component binds thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) and catalyzes the ThDP-mediated decarboxylation of α-keto acids (Reaction 2), resulting in an enamine-ThDP intermediate (E1b-R-COH=ThDP), and the reductive transfer of the enamine to the lipoyl moiety that is covalently attached to E2b (abbreviated as E2b-[lipS2]) (Reaction 3). The lipoyl-bearing domain (LBD) carrying the S-acyldihydrolipoamide serves as a “swinging arm” (5Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Google Scholar) to transfer the acyl group from E1b to the E2b active site, where it is converted to acyl-CoA (Reaction 4). Finally, the E3 component with a tightly bound FAD moiety re-oxidizes the dihydrolipoyl residue on E2b (E2b-[lip(SH)2]) (Reaction 5) with NAD+ as the ultimate electron acceptor (Reaction 6). The overall reaction is the production of branched-chain acyl-CoA, CO2, and NADH from BCKAs (Reaction 1). The E1b component of the human BCKD metabolic machine belongs to the superfamily of ThDP-dependent enzymes (6Jordan F. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 184-201Google Scholar) with 20 known members to date. There are currently nine crystal structures for ThDP-dependent enzymes in the Protein Data Bank, including E1b components of the human (7Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.T. Hol W.G. Structure. 2000; 8: 277-291Google Scholar) and Pseudomonas (8Ævarsson A. Seger K. Turley S. Sokatch J.R. Hol W.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 785-792Google Scholar) BCKD complexes. The human and Pseudomonas E1b components are α2β2 heterotetramers with a distinct ThDP-binding fold. Two ThDP-binding sites are located in α-β′ and α′-β subunit interfaces. The α subunits bind to the diphosphate modules through residues in a conserved sequence motif (9Hawkins C.F. Borges A. Perham R.N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 77-82Google Scholar) and involve a bridging Mg2+ ion (7Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.T. Hol W.G. Structure. 2000; 8: 277-291Google Scholar), and the β subunits bind to the pyrimidine modules of the cofactors. Moreover, a unique K+ ion-binding pocket in the human E1b α subunit is crucial for the conformation of a cofactor-binding loop (7Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.T. Hol W.G. Structure. 2000; 8: 277-291Google Scholar). The E1b ThDP-binding fold has also been observed recently in the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1p) component of the human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (10Ciszak E.M. Korotchkina L.G. Dominiak P.M. Sidhu S. Patel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21240-21246Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Ser292-α and Ser302-α (in the α subunit) of human E1b by the BCKD kinase abolishes the overall activity (Reaction 1) of the human BCKD complex (11Cook K.G. Bradford A.P. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 731-735Google Scholar). In a crystal structure of human E1b refined to 1.85 Å, these two phosphorylation sites are located in a so-called phosphorylation loop region in the human E1b active site (12Wynn R.M. Machius M. Chuang J.L. Li J. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43402-43410Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the sequence for the phosphorylation loop region is highly conserved among heterotetrameric (α2β2) E1 proteins from BCKD and pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes (12Wynn R.M. Machius M. Chuang J.L. Li J. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43402-43410Google Scholar, 13Fries M. Chauhan H.J. Domingo G.J. Jung H.I. Perham R.N. Eur. J.

The invariant His291-α in the phosphorylation loop region coordinates to ThDP, and the mutation of this residue disrupts the binding of the cofactor (12Wynn R.M. Machius M. Chuang J.L. Li J. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43402-43410Google Scholar, 14Hawes J.W. Schnepf R.J. Jenkins A.E. Shimomura Y. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31071-31076Google Scholar). The significance of sequence conservation for the phosphorylation loop region in E1b from Pseudomonas putida and E1p from the Gram-positive prokaryote Bacillus stearothermophilus is not entirely known, because these bacterial heterotetrameric E1 proteins are not regulated by reversible phosphorylation. In the present study, we dissect the role of the phosphorylation loop region in E1b catalysis in the context of the BCKD metabolic machine. We focus on residues in this loop region that are invariant among heterotetrameric E1 proteins of α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (Fig. 1A). Our results show that ThDP binding to apoE1b orders the phosphorylation loop region through the formation of a hydrogen-bonding network. The loop conformation is required for the recognition of E2b LBD domain to initiate E1b-catalyzed reductive acylation (Reaction 3). Moreover, this loop conformation prevents the inactivation of E1b through phosphorylation by the BCKD kinase. Thus, the cross-talk between cofactor binding and the phosphorylation loop region in E1b serves as a feed-forward switch for catalysis and subsequent substrate channeling in the human BCKD metabolic machine. This concerted regulatory mechanism through cofactor binding may have applications to other cofactor-dependent enzymes that are integral components of multienzyme complexes. Constructs and Proteins—N-terminally and C-terminally His6-tagged wild-type and mutant E1b proteins were produced as described previously (15Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Song J.L. Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 179-191Google Scholar) with mutations introduced using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit provided by Stratagene. Wild-type and mutant apoE1b proteins were obtained by exhaustive dialysis in the presence of 0.2 mm EDTA. C-terminally His6-tagged LBD (residues 1-84 of the E2b subunit) was expressed (16Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36905-36908Google Scholar) and lipoylated in vitro with dl-6,8-thioctic acid using LplA, a lipoic-protein ligase, as described earlier (17Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 192-200Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—The BCKD complex was reconstituted with E1b, lipoylated E2b (lip-E2), and E3 at a molar ratio of 12:1:55 as described previously (17Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 192-200Google Scholar). The oxidative decarboxylation of KIV catalyzed by the reconstituted complex (Reaction 1) was monitored by the increase of absorbance at 340 nm. ThDP-mediated decarboxylation by the isolated E1b component (Reaction 2) was assayed at 30 °C with KIV as substrate in the presence of an artificial electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) as described previously (18Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Moss C.C. Song J.L. Li J. Awad N. Mandel H. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17792-17800Google Scholar). The oxidation of enamine-ThDP (RCOH=ThDP) by DCPIP converts enamine-ThDP to a free acid (RCOOH), which promotes the turnover of enamine-ThDP with concomitant release of the product acid from E1b. Reduction of DCPIP was monitored by the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm. The direct measurement for the rate of decarboxylation by E1b was carried out by incubating wild-type or mutant E1b (15 μg each) with 1 mm [1-14C]KIV, 1 mm Mg-ThDP, and 100 μm DCPIP for 10 min in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 30 °C. The released CO2 was collected, and its radioactivity was counted as described previously (17Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 192-200Google Scholar). The assay for reductive acylation of lip-LBD catalyzed by E1b (Reaction 3) was carried out as described previously with modifications (12Wynn R.M. Machius M. Chuang J.L. Li J. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43402-43410Google Scholar). This assay is based on the irreversible decarboxylation step (Reaction 2) combined with the rate-limiting reductive acylation reaction, both catalyzed by E1b. The coupled reactions allow the use of [U-14C]KIV instead of enamine-ThDP as a substrate, with lip-LBD in lieu of E2b as the other. The assay was initiated by adding [U-14C]KIV (final concentration 2 mm) to the reaction mixture (final volume 250 μl) containing 16 μm lip-LBD and 0.16 μm E1b. After incubation at 22 °C for 45 s, the assay was terminated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final 10% (v/v) concentration, followed by the addition of 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin as a carrier. The precipitate was washed two times with 10% trichloroacetic acid to remove excess [U-14C]KIV and radiolabeled enamine-ThDP released from the denatured E1b protein. The washed pellet containing radiolabeled lip-LBD was resuspended in 50 μl of 8 m urea. To the suspension, 2 ml of scintillation mixture was added, and the radioactivity was determined. The nonspecific radioactivity trapped by nonlipoylated LBD and the E1b protein served as a blank. Binding Measurements Based on Tryptophan Fluorescence Quenching—Steady-state fluorescence quenching upon ThDP binding (19Hennig J. Kern G. Neef H. Bisswanger H. Hubner G. Bisswanger H. Schellenberger A. Biochemistry and Physiology of Thiamin Diphosphate Enzymes. AuC Intemann, Prien, Germany1966: 243-251Google Scholar) to wild-type and mutant E1b was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50 B luminescence spectrometer in the photon counting mode. Fluorescence intensities were recorded at 25 °C using a 3-ml quartz cuvette at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and an emission wavelength of 335 nm. Slit widths were set at 5 nm for excitation and 10 nm for emission. A 290 nm cut-off emission filter was installed to reduce light scattering effects. Protein concentrations for E1b and ThDP (A235 nm = 11,300 m-1 cm-1, pH > 7.0) were determined spectrophotometrically. The concentration for all protein samples was 0.2 μm (as heterotetramers) in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. Fluorescence readings were corrected for dilution and inner filter effects using Equation 1 (20Lakowicz J.R.M. Maliwal B.P. Cherek H. Balter A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1741-1752Google Scholar), Fcorr=Fobs(V/Vo)×100.5d(Aex+Aem) (Eq. 1) where, Fcorr is the corrected fluorescence intensity value; Fobs is the experimentally measured fluorescence intensity; V0 is the initial volume of the sample; V is the volume after adding ThDP; d is the path length of the cuvette; Aex is the absorption of the sample at the excitation wavelength; and Aem is the absorption of the sample at the emission wavelength. Three different readings were taken and averaged, and the experiment was repeated two times (n = 3). The binding data were fitted by nonlinear regression using the program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Essex Junction, VT) according to Equation 2 describing a bimolecular reaction (21Nemeria N. Yan Y. Zhang Z. Brown A.M. Arjunan P. Furey W. Guest J.R. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45969-45978Google Scholar), (−ΔF/F0)=(−ΔFmax/F0)×[ThDP]/(Kd+[ThDP]) (Eq. 2) where ΔF is the (corrected) fluorescence change; F0 is the fluorescence intensity prior to the addition of ThDP; ΔFmax is the maximal fluorescence change; Kd is the dissociation constant; and [ThDP] is the concentration of ThDP in the cuvette. The parameters determined by the fitting procedure were ΔFmax and Kd. Binding of LBD to E1b Studied by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Human E1b and lip-LBD, both C-terminally His6-tagged, were dialyzed exhaustively against the same reservoir of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.2 mm EDTA to remove bound Mg2+ ions and ThDP. Immediately prior to ITC measurements, MgCl2 and ThDP stock solutions were added to both E1b and lip-LBD to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. A stock of 1.5 mm lip-LBD in the syringe was added in 8-μl increments to a reaction cell containing 1.8 ml of 75 μm human E1b (based on the αβ heterodimer), and the resulting heat changes were measured at 22 °C in a Microcal (Northampton, MA) VP-ITC microcalorimeter. Binding isotherms were derived from heat changes resulting from the binding reactions as described previously (12Wynn R.M. Machius M. Chuang J.L. Li J. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43402-43410Google Scholar). Curve fitting and the derivation of thermodynamic parameters were carried out with the ORIGIN software package provided by Microcal. X-ray Crystallography of Wild-type and Mutant E1b Proteins—Crystals of wild-type and mutant human E1b proteins (C-terminally His6-tagged on the β subunit) were grown at 22 °C via the vapor diffusion method and frozen in liquid nitrogen as described previously (12Wynn R.M. Machius M. Chuang J.L. Li J. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43402-43410Google Scholar). For holoE1b crystals, Mn2+ ions could replace Mg2+ required for the binding of ThDP to E1b. The presence of Mn2+ ions in crystals resulted in improved x-ray diffraction qualities without affecting the catalytic properties (data not shown). Crystals obtained with this procedure exhibited the symmetry of space group P3121 with cell parameters of ∼145 × 145 × 69 Å and contained one αβ heterodimer per asymmetric unit. The crystals diffracted x-rays to a minimum Bragg spacing (dmin) of 1.8 Å. For x-ray diffraction, crystals were flash-cooled in liquid propane and kept at about 100 K during data collection at beamlines 19ID and 19BM (Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). Data sets were processed with the HKL2000 package (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar).

Manual adjustments to the models were carried out with the program O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). The electron density clearly showed the presence of glycerol molecules in the crystal structure. After the refinement of the protein part was complete, solvent molecules were added where stereochemically reasonable. Single residues with little corresponding electron densities were included in the model, when they were flanked by residues with well defined electron density. Complete refinement statistics are listed in Table I (see B). Limited Proteolysis of Wild-type and Mutant E1b Proteins—The digestion of 20 μg of apoE1b was carried out in a 50-μl volume in the presence and absence of ThDP for different times on ice in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 μg of chymotrypsin. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 mm PMSF, and the digestion mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis in 12% gels. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Blue or blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for N-terminal sequencing. Phosphorylation of E1b by the BCKD Kinase—A mixture containing 1 μg of E1b protein, 0.75 μg of lip-E2b, and 0.1 μg of maltose-binding protein-tagged rat BCKD kinase (26Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Meng M.

The phosphorylation reaction was initiated by adding 0.4 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 0.5 μCi/nmol ATP) to the above reaction mixture. After 1 min, the reaction was terminated by adding a concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% (w/v) SDS, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 500 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (w/v) bromphenol blue) with 1:5 dilution and immediately placed on ice. Samples were then heated at 65 °C for 10 min prior to loading onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 and vacuum-dried. Quantitative analysis of 32P incorporation to E1b was carried out by scanning a storage phosphor screen with a Typhoon 9200 Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences) using ImageQuant software. Structure of the Phosphorylation Loop Region in the E1b Active Site—We defined previously (12Wynn R.M. Machius M. Chuang J.L. Li J. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43402-43410Google Scholar) the phosphorylation loop region of human E1b to encompass residues Tyr286-α to Gln312-α. Electron density was not visible for residues Thr293-α, Ser294-α, and Ala299-α and between Ser302-α and Asn307-α in wild-type human E1b structure. The phosphorylation loop is generally ordered to varying degrees in different crystals. There is no apparent correlation between the order of the phosphorylation loop and crystallization conditions or crystal handling procedures. For example, an H146A-β′ mutant features electron density for the entire loop, and this is presented for illustrative purposes in Fig. 1B in a superposition with the wild-type E1b structure. The conformation of the phosphorylation loop region consists of a loop that harbors the two phosphorylation sites (Ser292-α and Ser302-α), followed by a short helix (Val303-α to Lys311-α) and a turn (Gln312-α to His314-α). Fig. 1C shows the four invariant residues (Arg287-α, Asp295-α, Tyr300-α, and Arg301-α) in the human E1b active site, whose side chains are located within a distance of 3 Å from each other forming an intricate hydrogen-bonding network in the phosphorylation loop region. Mutations in the Hydrogen-bonding Network Impede Catalysis of E1b and the BCKD Complex—To decipher the roles of these residues in catalysis, kinetic parameters of E1b mutants in the hydrogen-bonding network were determined. The decarboxylation activity of E1b according to Reaction 2 was measured with DCPIP as an electron acceptor. The conversion of R287A-α, Y300A-α, Y300F-α, and R301A-α mutations results in significantly higher Km values for the substrate KIV than the wild type (50.2 μm) (Table II). The highest increase (46-fold over the wild-type) was observed with the R287A-α variant. In contrast, the D295A-α mutant shows a Km for KIV similar to the wild type. In addition, Km values for ThDP for the mutants are 2-6-fold higher than for the wild type (6.6 μm). These kinetic parameters strongly suggest that the four residues forming the hydrogen-bonding network are critical for high affinity cofactor and/or substrate binding. Most interesting, kcat values for all five mutants are markedly elevated ranging from 2- to 3-fold over the wild type.Table IIKinetic parameters for the E1b-catalyzed decarboxylation reaction (Reaction 2) determined by the spectrophotometric DCPIP assayE1bKIVaDCPIP assays for KIV kinetic constants were carried out at 1 mm ThDP with varying KIV concentrations from 0.4 μm to 16 mm.

Open table in a new tab The decarboxylation of KIV by wild-type and mutant E1b (Reaction 2) was also measured directly by a radiochemical assay using [1-14C]KIV as a substrate in the presence of DCPIP. At the saturating substrate concentration of 1 mm, wild-type and D295A-α E1b show the decarboxylation rates of 9.9 and 28.8 nmol of CO2/min/nmol E1b, respectively (Fig. 2). These values are close to kcat values of 11.7 and 29.1 min-1, respectively, for wild-type and D295A-α E1b measured by the spectrophotometric DCPIP assay (Table II). Rates of decarboxylation for [1-14C]KIV are also increased in the Y300F-α and R301A-α mutant E1b compared with the wild type. Because Km values for KIV of these mutants are elevated (Table II), the rates of decarboxylation measured at the nonsaturating 1 mm [1-14C]KIV concentration are lower than kcat values. The robust nonenzymatic decarboxylation of [1-14C]KIV at high substrate concentrations prevented the accurate measurement of kcat values for these two E1b variants. Nonetheless, the above results confirm that the rate of decarboxylation for the keto acid is significantly enhanced in the phosphorylation loop mutants over the wild type. Effects of the above mutations on the overall activity, i.e. the oxidative decarboxylation of KIV catalyzed by the BCKD complex (Reaction 1), were also studied. The BCKD complex was reconstituted with wild-type or mutant E1b in the presence of lipoylated E2b and E3 at a molar ratio of 12:1:55. Y300A-α, Y300F-α, and R301A-α mutants show 3-8-fold increased Km values for KIV. The D295A-α variant shows the same Km value for KIV as the wild type (Table III), similar to that determined by the E1b decarboxylation assay (Reaction 2). It is striking that the BCKD complex reconstituted with the R287A-α mutant shows no detectable overall activity, despite the robust decarboxylase activity (Reaction 2) of this E1b mutant. The kcat values for the other four mutants are significantly lower than for the wild type. The Km value of wild-type E1b for ThDP is 0.63 μm, which is an order of magnitude lower than that measured for E1b alone. The higher Km values for ThDP combined with reduced kcat for the re"

We have quantified lamellipodial protrusion dynamics in human vascular smooth muscle cells exposed to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and type I collagen, two distinct ligands presented to vascular cells during arterial remodeling. Video microscopy revealed that FGF-2 stimulated a modest increase in lamellipodial protrusion rate that peaked within 15 min. This response was associated with immediate but transient activation of Rac1 and was inhibited in cells infected with retrovirus containing cDNA encoding dominant-negative Rac1. A 1-h exposure to FGF-2 also set up a second phase of more striking lamellipodial protrusion evident at 24–36 h. This delayed response was most pronounced when cells were on type 1 collagen and was associated with FGF-2-induced expression of collagenase-1 that localized to the edge of protruding lamellipodia. Moreover, late membrane protrusion was inhibited when cells were on collagenase-resistant type I collagen, implicating degraded collagen as a mediator. For cells on collagen, the immediate activation of Rac1 by FGF-2 was followed by a sustained wave of Rac1 activation that was inhibited when cleavage of the collagen triple helix was prevented and also by blockade of αvβ3 integrin. We conclude that lamellipodial protrusion in smooth muscle cells can be regulated by waves of Rac1 activation, corresponding to the sequential presentation of FGF-2 and remodeled collagen. The findings thus reveal a previously unrecognized level of coordination among extracellular input that enables cells to maintain protrusive activity over prolonged periods.

The findings thus reveal a previously unrecognized level of coordination among extracellular input that enables cells to maintain protrusive activity over prolonged periods. In the mature vasculature, smooth muscle cells (SMCs) 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cell; ECM, extracellular matrix; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBD, protein-binding domain.1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cell; ECM, extracellular matrix; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBD, protein-binding domain. serve primarily as units of contraction. However, vascular SMCs also have the capacity to migrate and do so during vascular remodeling and disease. In these circumstances, SMCs migrate to regions in the vessel wall that have been damaged, for example by inflammation, where they replicate and elaborate the extracellular matrix (ECM). Although this process is designed to be reparative, it can also be deleterious leading to narrowing of the vessel lumen, restricted blood flow, and organ ischemia.SMC migration, like that of other cells, proceeds in a cycle that begins with the formation and protrusion of veil-like structures at the leading edge of the cell known as lamellipodia. Lamellipodia can stably attach to the ECM substrate, which enables traction forces to be generated to move the cell body forward. The trailing aspect of the cell then retracts to complete the cycle. Although all components of the migration cycle are necessary for cell translocation, protrusion of plasma membrane effectively leads the cell to its new location and is thus deemed to represent the essence of cell motility.Intensive investigation in recent years has elucidated the mechanistic basis of lamellipodial protrusion as well as the signaling paths that impinge on the protrusion machinery (1Pollard T.D. Nature. 2003; 422: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3230) Google Scholar). Central to the process is a dynamic network of branching actin filaments that serve to push membrane forward. Each new branch of actin in the lamellipodial network forms on the side of a parent filament, under the control of the Arp 2/3 complex of proteins. Assembly of the Arp 2/3 complex is activated by the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and related proteins. Rho family GTPases, in turn, activate the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteins. Of the Rho GTPases, Rac1 is particularly important to lamellipodial protrusion because it can effectively switch the lamellipodial ruffling process on or off, depending on its state of activation (3Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3049) Google Scholar, 4Hall A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar).In contrast to growing data on the intracellular events underlying lamellipodial protrusion, less is known about the environmental signals that regulate these events. One extracellular factor that is known to generally influence SMC migration is fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2, basic FGF) (6Jackson C.L. Reidy M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1024-1031PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pickering J.G. Uniyal S. Ford C. Chau T. Laurin M.A. Chow L.H. Ellis C.G. Fish J. Chan B.M.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). FGF-2 is liberated to act on SMCs following vascular injury and can stimulate SMCs to crawl from the medial vascular layer into the intimal layer (6Jackson C.L. Reidy M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1024-1031PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lindner V. Reidy M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3739-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). We have observed that SMC migration is particularly enhanced by FGF-2 when cells are on a substrate of type I collagen (7Pickering J.G. Uniyal S. Ford C. Chau T. Laurin M.A. Chow L.H. Ellis C.G. Fish J. Chan B.M.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This apparent synergy between FGF-2 and type I collagen is noteworthy given the abundance of type I collagen fibrils in the interstitium of the vessel wall and the consequent need for migrating SMCs to navigate through this network.The basic mechanism by which FGF-2 promotes SMC migration is not fully defined, but current evidence suggests that FGF-2 alters the interplay between SMCs and the surrounding ECM (9Boilly B. Vercoutter-Edouart A.S. Hondermarck H. Nurcombe V. Le Bourhis X. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In keeping with this concept, FGF-2 is one of a limited number of factors that can induce the expression of collagenase-1 in SMCs (10Pickering J.G. Ford C.M. Tang B. Chow L.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 475-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which could effectively clear a path for SMC migration. In addition, we recently determined that FGF-2-induced expression of collagenase-1 enabled migrating SMCs to efficiently release their tail from the collagen substrate, which allowed the tail to smoothly retract into the cell body (11Li S. Chow L.H. Pickering J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35384-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, FGF-2-induced type I collagen degradation appears to regulate the final, rear retraction phase of the locomotory cycle. Whether or not FGF-2, type I collagen, or their combination plays a more direct role in cell migration by driving lamellipodial protrusion is unknown. Protrusive processes at the cell front are fundamentally distinct from retraction events at the cell rear, yet these two processes must be coordinated for effective translocation of the cell. It is an intriguing question, therefore, whether the same environmental stimuli can orchestrate both forward protrusion and also rear retraction of plasma membrane and, if so, how this might occur.To evaluate the impact of FGF-2 on plasma membrane protrusion in SMCs, we undertook video microscopic analyses of lamellipodial activity in primary human vascular SMCs. We provide evidence that lamellipodial protrusion is regulated by two temporally and mechanistically distinct phases. Exposure of SMCs to FGF-2 resulted in immediate but transient activation of Rac1 and transient protrusion of plasma membrane. This was followed by a prolonged phase of Rac1 activation and lamellipodial activity that was particularly striking when the cells were on a type 1 collagen substrate. This second wave of Rac1-mediated protrusion of plasma membrane was associated with collagenase-1 expression at the edge of protruding lamellipodia. Moreover, the second wave was dependent on type I collagen cleavage and signaling through αvβ3 integrin. The findings suggest a model whereby environmental cues are dynamically coordinated to generate a sequential activation system for Rac1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Reagents—Primary cultures of human vascular SMCs were established by explant outgrowth of unused segments of internal thoracic artery retrieved at the time of coronary artery bypass surgery (12Pickering J.G. Bacha P. Weir L. Jekanowski J. Nichols J.C. Isner J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 724-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SMCs were studied in the second to fourth subcultures, and their identity was confirmed morphologically and by positive immunostaining for smooth muscle α-actin (1A4; Dako). The cells were grown in M199 supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics and plated on substrates of human fibronectin (100 μg/ml), rat tail collagen (100 μg/ml), or mouse tail collagen (100 μg/ml). Fibronectin was purified from human plasma by gelatin-Sepharose chromatography, as described (13Pickering J.G. Chow L.H. Li S. Rogers K.A. Rocnik E.F. Zhong R. Chan B.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Rat and mouse tail collagen (primarily type I collagen) were isolated by solubilization in acetic acid, as described (14Bell E. Ivarsson B. Merrill C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1274-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar, 15Li S. Van Den Diepstraten C. D'Souza S.J. Chan B.M. Pickering J.G. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1045-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Mutant, collagenase-resistant collagen was prepared from tails of mice (B6,129S-Col1a1tm1Jae; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) bearing targeted substitutions of 3 amino acids at the collagenase cleavage site of the α1(I) collagen chain (16Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2819-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Liu X. Wu H. Byrne M. Jeffrey J. Krane S. Jaenisch R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These mutations render the triple helical domain of type I collagen resistant to cleavage by interstitial collagenases. Monoclonal anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody (LM609) was purchased from Chemicon, and nonspecific control mouse IgG was obtained from the P3 cell line (ATCC).Generation of Recombinant Retrovirus and Infection of Human SMCs—A retroviral gene delivery system (18Rocnik E.F. van der Veer E. Cao H. Hegele R.A. Pickering J.G. J. Biol.

The bicistronic cassette was excised and cloned into pLNCX2 (Clontech). Retroviral delivery constructs were introduced into the Phoenix-amphotropic retrovirus packaging/producing cell line (kindly provided by Dr. G. P. Nolan, Stanford University Medical School, CA; distributed by ATCC) (20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar) by calcium phosphatemediated transfection. The virus-containing culture supernatant was harvested 48–72 h later and, after centrifugation and filtration (0.45-μm pore filters), was added to proliferating human SMCs with 5 μg/ml Sequa-brene for 48 h. SMC infection efficiency was estimated at 40% based on EGFP fluorescence. The cells stably expressing mutant DNA constructs or EGFP alone were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. Expression of mutant constructs was confirmed by Western blot analysis.Time Lapse Videomicroscopy and Measurement of Lamellipodial Protrusion Rate—SMC motility was evaluated using digital time lapse video microscopy (11Li S. Chow L.H. Pickering J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35384-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Rocnik E.F. Chan B.M.C. Pickering J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1889-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The cells plated onto 35-mm culture dishes coated with human fibronectin, rat tail collagen, or mouse tail collagen were imaged with an inverted microscope (Axiovert S100; Carl Zeiss, Inc. Thornwood, NY) using Hoffman-modulated contrast optics. The images were digitally acquired every 10 s over a 5–20-min recording period, using a CCD video camera (Sony XC-75/75CE) and time lapse software (Northern Eclipse, Empix Imaging, Inc.). Ambient temperature was maintained at 37 °C by mounting the culture dish in a temperature control cell (CC-100; 20/20 Technology Inc. Wilmington, NC), and a stream of warmed (37 °C) and humidified air was delivered continuously over a culture lid to prevent condensation. To maintain physiologic pH in the room air, the cells were incubated in bicarbonate-reduced medium M199 with Hanks' salts and 25 mm Hepes.To measure membrane protrusion, images acquired either 10 or 30 s apart were digitally overlaid, and a Boolean difference operation was applied. Subtracting the first of the two images from the second yielded the area of membrane that had protruded during the time interval (see Fig. 1). The area of all cell segments that had protruded over the 10- or 30-s interval was expressed as a fraction of the total cell area, determined from the first of each of the paired images. This procedure was repeated for the entire stack of images acquired over a 5–20-min recording (i.e. 30–120 serial image pairs, when using a 10-s image acquisition interval). The protrusion values were averaged and expressed as a mean fractional protrusion rate.Membrane protrusion rates were determined in SMCs exposed to FGF-2 (25 ng/ml) for the designated period of time. Prior to stimulation, SMCs were rendered quiescent by incubating in M199 with 1% FBS for 48 h. To assess the effects of a discrete pulse of FGF-2, FGF-2 was removed from the cultures after 30 min, 1 h, or 4 h. The cells were then acid-washed twice (50 mm glycine, pH 2.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone) to remove receptor-bound FGF-2. SMCs were then incubated with basal media (M199 with 1% FBS) until the 24-h time point, at which time the lamellipodial protrusion rate was quantified.Immunohistochemistry—Expression of collagenase-1 in human SMCs was assessed in SMCs grown on collagen-coated coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were incubated with a monoclonal antibody against human collagenase-1 (Calbiochem, Cambridge, MA), and bound primary antibody was detected using biotin-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and avidin-peroxidase and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride chromogen.cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA Activity Assays—To assay the activity of Rac1 and cdc42, SMC lysate was affinity-purified using a fragment of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) (22Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The assay exploits the fact that PAK1, a downstream effector of Rac1 and cdc42, binds the respective GTPase in only its activated, GTP-bound form. cDNA from the protein-binding domain of PAK1 (PBD, corresponding to amino acids 67–150) was amplified by PCR from human placental cDNA and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T. This construct was expressed in Escherichia coli, and bacteria were lysed by passing through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. and mixing with 1% Triton X-100. The lysate was mixed with 300 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biosciences), and the PBD-GST beads mixture was suspended in 150 μl of interaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin).After stimulating SMCs on the designated substrate with FGF-2, the cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with cold interaction buffer. Lysate containing 200 μg of protein (Bio-Rad) was incubated with 20 μl of the PBD-GST bead mixture overnight at 4 °C. Affinity-purified proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted using monoclonal antibodies against human Rac1 (BD Transduction Laboratories) or human cdc42 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bound primary antibody was detected with anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibody and chemiluminescence detection reagents (ECL; Roche Applied Science) and x-ray film (X-Omat LS; Eastman Kodak Co.) exposure. The bands were assessed by densitometry (ChemiDoc; Bio-Rad), and the amount of PBD-bound Rac1 was compared with total cellular Rac1, ascertained by simultaneously immunoblotting cell lysate that was not subjected it to affinity purification. RhoA activity was assessed in a manner similar to that for Rac1, except that SMCs were lysed using RIPA buffer, and GTP-bound RhoA was affinity-precipitated using a Rhotekin-GST fusion protein (cDNA kindly supplied by M. Schwartz, La Jolla, CA) expressed in E. coli, as described (23Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using a monoclonal antibody against human RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).RESULTSFGF-2 Stimulates Plasma Membrane Protrusion of Human Vascular SMCs—Migrating human SMCs are spread, quasipolygonal cells that have one or more lamellipodial extensions. In the absence of a strong directional stimulus for SMC migration membrane activity is unpredictable; some lamellipodia protrude, whereas other extensions might cease ruffling and shrink. Therefore, to accurately assess membrane protrusion in SMCS, we undertook rapid acquisition time lapse microscopy and analyzed the entire cell periphery throughout the recording period. Images acquired either 10 or 30 s apart were paired and digitally overlaid, and the area of protruding regions were quantified by a Boolean difference operation (Fig. 1). The proportion of the cell that displayed protrusion was quantified in serial image pairs for the entire recording period, from which a mean fractional protrusion rate was determined.To determine whether FGF-2 could acutely influence plasma membrane dynamics, membrane protrusion in individual human SMCs was tracked serially under resting conditions (M199 with 1% FBS), following the addition of 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and following the addition of FGF-2. As depicted in Fig. 2, there was a prompt increase in plasma membrane protrusion following delivery of FGF-2. Averaged data showed that within 5 min of administration of FGF-2, there was a 1.4-fold increase in the fractional membrane protrusion rate (p < 0.01). This response reached a peak 10–15 min after delivery of growth factor and declined thereafter (Fig. 2, D and E). The substrate on which SMCs were plated had no effect on this immediate protrusion response to FGF-2, with no differences observed between SMCs on type I collagen, fibronectin, or vitronectin (data not shown).Fig. 2Acute effect of FGF-2 on plasma membrane protrusion in human vascular SMCs. Shown are Hoffman-modulated contrast images of a human SMC under basal conditions (A, M199 and 1% FBS), 3 min after the addition of 1% bovine serum albumin (B), and 3 min after the addition of 25 ng/ml FGF-2 (C). The outlines represent the initial cell contours from A. Bar, 10 μm. D, serial membrane protrusion measurements from a single SMC monitored for 5 min under basal conditions, 5 min after the delivery of bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 20 min after the delivery of FGF-2 (25 ng/ml). Membrane protrusion was measured as the relative area of membrane that had extended over each 10-s interval, as described in the legend to Fig. 1. E, average fractional lamellipodial protrusion rates under base-line conditions and following FGF-2 stimulation. The data represent the mean fractional protrusion rate ± S.E. from a total of 11–14 cells from four separate experiments. For each cell, the average fractional protrusion was determined from serial images every 30 s during the designated period. *, p < 0.01 versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To translocate the distances required in vivo, the relatively slow moving SMCs can be expected to crawl for sustained periods. Therefore, we next evaluated plasma membrane dynamics 36 h after the addition of FGF-2 to the cultures. As shown in Fig. 3 (including the video files), at this time point there was a marked increase in lamellipodial activity that was more pronounced than that seen immediately following FGF-2 delivery. In addition, we observed that the magnitude of the late protrusion response depended on the ECM substrate. Fractional plasma membrane protrusion rate for FGF-2-treated SMCs on collagen was substantially higher than that for FGF-2-treated SMCs on fibronectin (9.8 ± 0.9 versus 3.3 ± 0.4% min–1, p < 0.001). The greater protrusive response for FGF-2-treated SMCs on type I collagen versus fibronectin did not seem to be a function of differential base-line adhesive forces, because SMCs abundantly express both collagen and fibronectin receptors (7Pickering J.G. Uniyal S. Ford C. Chau T. Laurin M.A. Chow L.H. Ellis C.G. Fish J. Chan B.M.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and varying the concentration of fibronectin (1–200 μg/ml) did not yield a response to FGF-2 that was as great as that for SMCs on type I collagen (10 or 100 μg/ml) (data not shown). In summary, FGF-2 induces immediate lamellipodial protrusion of SMCs but also endows SMCs with a pronounced ability to ruffle and extend lamellipodia for a sustained period. The magnitude of the sustained response depends on the ECM environment, with an apparent interplay between FGF-2 and type I collagen.Fig. 3Delayed effect of FGF-2 on plasma membrane protrusion in human vascular SMCs.A–D, paired photomicrographs of SMCs on rat tail collagen (100 μg/ml) acquired 5 min apart. The cells were rendered quiescent in M199 with 1% FBS for 24 h, followed by the addition of vehicle (A and B) or 25 ng/ml FGF-2 (C and D) for 36 h. The outlines represent the initial cell contours from the first image in each sequence, and arrows point to regions of plasma membrane that protruded over 5 min. Corresponding movie files (see movie files Control.Mov and FGF.mov, available as supplemental material in the online version of this article) further illustrate the enhanced lamellipodial ruffling and protrusion observed in SMCs 36 h after the addition of FGF-2. E, fractional lamellipodial protrusion rates for control and FGF-2-treated SMCs plated on either fibronectin or rat tail collagen. The average membrane protrusion rate for a given cell was ascertained over a 10-min recording period.

Ford C.M. Tang B. Chow L.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 475-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that lamellipodial activity might be influenced by proteolytic alteration of the collagen substrate. To verify that collagenase-1 was expressed in FGF-2-treated SMCs and to localize the enzyme, SMCs were immunostained using a monoclonal antibody against collagenase-1. No immunoreactivity was evident in vehicle-treated, subconfluent SMCs on either type I collagen or fibronectin. However, after treatment with FGF-2, collagenase-1 immunoreactivity was observed at the cell body, along the length of the tail, and, interestingly, as discrete signals at the edge of the extending lamellipodia (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Expression of collagenase-1 in human vascular SMCs. SMCs plated on rat tail collagen were incubated for 36 h with vehicle (A) or 25 ng/ml FGF-2 (B) and immunostained for collagenase-1, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” No signal was evident in unstimulated SMCs. However, FGF-2-treated SMCs show cell-associated collagenase-1, including a localized rim of immunoreactivity at the leading edge of the cell (arrows).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine the functional consequences of collagenase action on lamellipodial dynamics, we analyzed membrane protrusion of SMCs plated on collagenase-resistant mutant collagen. This substrate was prepared from the tails of mice harboring a mutation in the col1A1 gene corresponding to the collagenase-1 cleavage site. This mutation renders the collagen triple helix resistant to cleavage at the rate-limiting cleavage site, three-quarters of the way along the length of the triple helix (16Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As illustrated in the figures and video files of Fig. 5, the ability of FGF-2 to stimulate late, sustained membrane protrusion was blunted when SMCs were plated on collagenase-resistant mouse tail collagen. The mean lamellipodial protrusion rate of FGF-2-treated SMCs migrating on mutant collagen was 29% that of FGF-2-treated SMCs on wild-type mouse tail collagen (p < 0.01) and similar to the protrusion rates found for FGF-2-treated SMCs on fibronectin (Fig. 2). Thus, the capacity to proteolytically edit a type I collagen substrate substantially influences lamellipodial activity in SMCs.Fig. 5Effect of FGF-2 on plasma membrane protrusion in human vascular SMCs plated on wild-type or collagenase-resistant mouse tail collagen.A–D, paired photomicrographs of SMCs treated for 36 h with FGF-2, acquired 5 min apart.

https://openalex.org/W2013752837,"In many epithelial tissues in the body, the rate of Na+ reabsorption is governed by the activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). The assembly, trafficking, and turnover of the three ENaC subunits (α, β, and γ) is complex and not well understood. Recent experiments suggest that ENaC must be proteolytically cleaved for maximal activity and may explain the discrepancies reported in prior biochemical approaches focused on quantitating the trafficking and half-life of full-length subunits. As an alternative approach to examining the dynamics of ENaC subunits, we have generated doxycycline-repressible replication-defective recombinant adenoviruses encoding individual epitope-tagged mouse ENaC subunits and expressed these in polarized MDCK I cells. Co-infection with these viruses encoding all three subunits generates robust amiloride-sensitive currents in polarized MDCK cells. Significant current was also observed in cells expressing α- and γ-mENaC in the absence of β-mENaC. These currents did not appear to result from association with endogenous canine β-ENaC. Treatment of αβγ-expressing cells with cycloheximide (CHX) resulted in the rapid inhibition (within 3 h) of ∼50–80% of the initial current; however, a sizable fraction of the initial current remained even after 6 h of CHX. By contrast, CHX addition to cells expressing only α- and γ-mENaC resulted in rapid decay in current with no residual fraction. Our data suggest that ENaC channels of differing stoichiometries are differentially trafficked and degraded and provide support for the possibility that noncoordinate trafficking of ENaC subunits may function in vivo as a mechanism to modulate ENaC activity.

Pradervand S. Schild L. Hummler E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 877-897Google Scholar). Given the clinical importance of ENaC activity, the assembly, trafficking, and response to hormonal stimulation of ENaC subunits have been subjects of considerable study and debate. While biochemical studies from several laboratories universally report a short half-life for the total pool of newly synthesized ENaC subunits (typically 1–2 h) (2Valentijn J.A. Fyfe G.K.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Google Scholar), there is considerable dispute regarding the stability of ENaC subunits that have reached the plasma membrane. Some studies report rapid decay of all three cell surface subunits in polarized MDCK and A6 cells (4Hanwell D. Ishikawa T. Saleki R. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9772-9779Google Scholar, 5Alvarez de la Rosa D. Li H. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 427-442Google Scholar), whereas we and others have observed long half-lives of α- and γ-ENaC that were biotinylated at the apical plasma membrane of A6 cells (6Weisz O.A. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39886-39893Google Scholar, 8Kleyman T.R. Zuckerman J.B. Middleton P. McNulty K.A. Hu B. Su X. An B. Eaton D.C. Smith P.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F213-F221Google Scholar). We use the term noncoordinate regulation to describe this differential turnover of ENaC subunits and have proposed possible molecular models for this observation based on experimental results from many laboratories (6Weisz O.A. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39886-39893Google Scholar, 9Weisz O.A. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F833-F842Google Scholar). Considerable data suggest that activation of ENaC channels is regulated by proteolytic enzymes (10Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Google Scholar, 11Adachi M. Kitamura K. Miyoshi T. Narikiyo T. Iwashita K. Shiraishi N. Nonoguchi H. Tomita K. J. Am. Soc.

Recently, new evidence has emerged that suggests that activation of ENaC involves direct furin-mediated cleavage of α- and γ-ENaC subunits within the biosynthetic pathway (13Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37073-37082Google Scholar, 14Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P. Stockand J.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18111-18114Google Scholar). These results suggest that changes in biochemical levels of full-length ENaC subunits may not correlate directly with modulation of sodium currents. Because sodium current rather than biochemical levels of ENaC subunits is the ultimate expression of ENaC activity, we have taken an alternative approach to examining ENaC trafficking and dynamics by measuring the stability of ENaC current upon inhibition of new protein synthesis. To do this, we generated replication-defective recombinant adenoviruses (AVs) encoding epitope-tagged α-, β-, and γ-mENaC and used these to infect polarized MDCK I cells. Whereas uninfected cells have very low endogenous ENaC activity, co-infection of MDCK I cells with AVs encoding all three ENaC subunits generates a robust amiloride-sensitive, sodium-dependent current. Moreover, protein expression in our system is dependent on transcription via the tetracycline operon and can therefore be reversibly inhibited by inclusion of low levels of doxycycline in the growth medium. This system therefore offers tremendous flexibility in our ability to regulate the expression of ENaC subunits in a renal epithelial cell line that maintains physiologic regulatory mechanisms. Using this system, we have observed distinct current decay profiles in cycloheximide (CHX)-treated cells infected with different combinations of ENaC subunits. Our results suggest that stoichiometry-dependent trafficking of ENaC subunit combinations could serve as a physiological mechanism to regulate sodium reabsorption in vivo. Cell Lines and Adenoviruses—MDCK type I cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and penicillin (100 units/ml). The generation of cDNAs for mouse ENaC (mENaC) subunits epitope-tagged on their carboxyl termini (V5 tag on α- and γ-mENaC; FLAG tag on β-mENaC) is described in Ref. 13Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M.

The constructs were amplified by PCR and subcloned downstream of the tetracycline operon in the pAdtet vector using HindIII and SpeI restriction sites. Full-length β- and γ-xENaC were provided by Dr. Douglas Eaton and subcloned into pAdtet using standard cloning techniques. Replication-defective recombinant AVs were generated using the method described in Ref. 15Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Google Scholar. Unless otherwise stated, cells were seeded at high density (∼2 × 105 cells/well) on 12-mm transwells (0.4-μm pore; Costar, Cambridge, MA) for 3–5 days prior to infection with recombinant AV at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 60 for each subunit unless otherwise indicated. For optimal infection, filter-grown cells were rinsed extensively with calcium-free PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-Mg2+). Subsequently, individual transwells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C on 50-μl drops of PBS-Mg2+-containing virus, with an additional 150 μl of PBS-Mg2+/virus placed on the apical surface of the transwell. Samples were then returned to normal growth medium. Recombinant adenovirus (m.o.i. 60–100) encoding the constitutive expression of tetracycline-repressible transactivator was included in all experiments to enable doxycycline-repressible synthesis of ENaC subunits. Experiments were initiated the day after infection. PCR Analysis and Partial Cloning of Canine β-ENaC—Total RNA was isolated from 2 × 75-mm transwells of MDCK I cells using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion). Single-stranded cDNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA using the ProtoScript kit (New England Biolabs). The cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers designed against ENaC subunit nucleotide sequences that are invariant between Xenopus, rat, mouse, and human ENaC: α (5′-CTTCTGCAACAA(C/T)ACCACCATCC; 3′-GATGGAGGTCTCCAC(C/T)CCAGGC); β (5′-(G/T)T(A/G)AC(A/T)GAGTGGTACATCCTGC; 3′-AAT(A/T)CCCTTCCTGCTCAGGGTG); and γ (5′-AA(C/T)ATCATGGCACAGGTGCCTC; 3′-AGCATCTCAATACTGTTGGCTG). PCR products were cloned into pTOPO-BluntII (Invitrogen). Clones containing PCR products were sequenced. To obtain the C-terminal sequence of canine β-ENaC, a new 5′-specific primer (AACACATGATCCAGAACTGC) and a degenerate 3′ primer (CTAGATGGCCTCCACCTC(A/G)CTTGTC) against the 3′-untranslated region were generated. PCR and analysis were performed as above. Antibodies and Indirect Immunofluorescence—Monclonal anti-V5 antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. Although our β-mENaC construct is tagged with the FLAG epitope, we found that antibodies directed against β-ENaC were more effective at detecting this construct than commercially available anti-FLAG antibodies. The characterization of polyclonal antibodies directed against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of β-xENaC is described in Ref. 16Rokaw M.D. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A. Hui D. Middleton P.

This antibody recognizes β-mENaC in methanol-fixed cells and efficiently immunoprecipitates β-mENaC. An additional anti-β-ENaC antibody directed against the tail sequence of rat/mouse β-ENaC was the kind gift of Dr. Mark Knepper (17Masilamani S. Kim G.-H. Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Inv. 1999; 104: R19-R23Google Scholar). To localize α- and γ-mENaC-expressing cells, virally infected filter-grown MDCK I cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed for 20 min with 3% paraformaldehyde at ambient temperature, and then quenched briefly with PBS containing 10 mm glycine and 0.02% sodium azide (PBS-G) and permeabilized for 3 min in PBS-G containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. To localize cells expressing β-mENaC, cells were fixed with –20 °C methanol for 10 min. The subsequent steps were similar for both fixation conditions. After blocking nonspecific binding sites with 0.25% ovalbumin in PBS-G, filters were incubated with primary antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-V5 (1:200 dilution) or affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-β-xENaC (1:100 dilution)) for 20 min. The filters were then washed extensively and incubated with Cy3 or Cy2 conjugated with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies respectively (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) as appropriate. After further washing, filters were cut from their inserts, mounted onto glass slides, and viewed at × 60 magnification using a Nikon EFD-3 microscope. Images were captured using a Hamamatsu C5985 cooled CCD camera and processed using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems Inc.). Radiolabeling and Immunoprecipitation—Virally infected MDCK cells were starved in cysteine- and methionine-free medium, radiolabeled using Tran35S-label (50 μCi/ml; MP Biomedicals) for 1 h and chased in serum-free modified Eagle's medium. At the appropriate chase time, cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed in detergent solution (6Weisz O.A. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39886-39893Google Scholar). After a brief centrifugation to remove nuclei, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-β-ENaC or -V5 antibodies, and antibody-antigen complexes were collected using fixed Staphylococcus aureus (Pansorbin; Calbiochem) or protein G-coupled Sepharose (Sigma), respectively. After washing with radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS), samples were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed using a Personal FX phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). Electrophysiological Measurement of Current Decay in Cycloheximide-treated Cells—A 100× concentrated stock of cycloheximide (10 mg/ml; Sigma; prepared in MDCK I medium) was added to both the apical and basolateral surfaces of the transwell without changing the medium, and the cells were returned to the incubator. MDCK I cells treated with this concentration of CHX maintained normal transepithelial resistances for at least 7 h. Equivalent short circuit currents (Isc) were measured in a sterile hood at the indicated time intervals using an electrode voltage ohmmeter from World Precision Instruments. The electrode was calibrated using growth medium prior to measurement of the potential difference and resistance across the filter. Resistance was normalized to the surface area of the transwell. Current was calculated using the potential difference across the filter divided by the resistance normalized to surface area to obtain readings measured in μA/cm2. The rate of current decay was analyzed using OriginPro 6.1 statistical software (OriginLab). Data were fit to exponential decay functions; the statistically best fit for each data set was obtained with first order exponential decay fit to the equation y = y0 + A1e–x/t1. Fit of the data was not improved by use of two exponential functions or linear functions. For analysis of current decay in both αβγ- and αγ-expressing cells, R2 > 0.97 for all fits to first order exponential decay. Adenovirus-mediated Expression of mENaC Subunits in MDCK I Cells—Our studies utilized high resistance type I MDCK cells, which have been used previously for studies on the trafficking of heterologously expressed ENaC subunits (4Hanwell D. Ishikawa T. Saleki R. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9772-9779Google Scholar, 7Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Google Scholar). When grown as polarized monolayers on filter supports, we measured a very low Isc (0.27 ± 0.02 μA/cm2; n = 12) that was unaffected by the addition of 100 μm amiloride. Stimulation by overnight treatment with aldosterone or brief treatment with vasopressin increased currents to 0.87 ± 0.13 μA/cm2 (n = 3) and 0.85 ± 0.13 μA/cm2 (n = 3), respectively, but did not affect the amiloride-sensitive component. 2S. Mohan, J. R. Bruns, and O. A. Weisz, unpublished observations. To determine whether AV infection provides an effective method to express functional ENaC channels in these cells, we infected filter-grown polarized monolayers with recombinant AVs encoding epitope-tagged α-, β-, and/or γ-mENaC subunits. An AV encoding constitutively expressed tetracycline transactivator, required to drive expression from the tetracycline operon, was also included. Both α- and γ-mENaC carry C-terminal V5 tags, whereas β-mENaC is tagged with the FLAG epitope. The following day, cells were starved, metabolically labeled for 1 h, and solubilized, and ENaC subunits were immunoprecipitated using anti-V5 (Fig. 1A). Both α- and γ-mENaC subunits were readily detected in cells expressing either individual subunits or all three subunits. Similarly, antibodies directed against either mouse or Xenopus β-ENaC tail peptides efficiently precipitated AV-expressed β-mENaC (Fig. 1B). To confirm that AV infection of these MDCK cells is efficient, we performed indirect immunofluorescence on filter-grown MDCK I cells infected with AVs encoding all three mENaC subunits (Fig. 1C). α- and γ-mENaC were co-visualized using monoclonal anti-V5 antibody, whereas β-mENaC was visualized using a polyclonal antibody raised against β-xENaC. Whereas the fixation requirements for these antibodies precluded double-labeling, we routinely observed bright staining in >60% of cells in each field. By contrast, no staining was detected in mock-infected cells. Quantitation of short circuit currents in polarized MDCK I cells infected with AVs encoding all three ENaC subunits revealed sizable currents (Fig. 1D). Isc was completely blocked when sodium in the medium was replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine and recovered when sodium was restored. Moreover, the majority of current was inhibited when 100 μm amiloride was added. We generally measured an increase in Isc upon the addition of fresh growth medium to ENaC-expressing MDCK I cells, and this could account for the overshoot in amiloride-sensitive Isc that we observed upon replacement of sodium-free medium with normal growth medium. We then examined the ability of ENaC subunits expressed in varying combinations to generate amiloride-sensitive Isc in polarized MDCK cells. Expression of individual ENaC subunits or of αβ or βγ alone did not produce significant currents in these cells (Fig. 1E). However, coexpression of α- and γ-mENaC typically yielded amiloride-sensitive currents that were ∼30–40% of those observed in cells infected with AVs encoding all three subunits. This is somewhat higher than previous reports, which have suggested that expression of α- and γ-ENaC in Xenopus oocytes generates up to ∼20% of maximal Isc (18McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Google Scholar). Current Decay in mENaC-expressing MDCK Cells Treated with CHX—To examine the stability of ENaC current at the cell surface in the absence of new protein synthesis, we monitored the effect of CHX on Isc in polarized MDCK I cells infected with AVs encoding all three ENaC subunits or α- and γ-mENaC (Fig. 2). Control experiments demonstrated that this concentration of CHX (100 μg/ml) very rapidly decreased the rate of protein synthesis to 0.03% of control.2 The decay in Isc in αγ-expressing cells was rapid and essentially complete by 8 h of CHX treatment. By contrast, the addition of CHX to αβγ-expressing cells resulted in an initially rapid decline in Isc that leveled off after 2–3 h and remained relatively stable for the remainder of the incubation. Table I shows the half-time of decay calculated from five independent experiments performed using identical expression conditions for αβγ- and αγ-expressing cells. The pattern of initial current decay was best fit by a single exponential decay function with a mean time constant of 2.56 h ± 0.74 for αβγ-expressing cells and 2.12 h ± 0.46 for αγ-expressing cells (n = 5; mean ± S.D.) An example of the curve fitting is shown in Fig 2B. It is readily apparent that whereas all of the current decayed exponentially in αγ-expressing cells, the fit curve accounts for the decay of only ∼50% of the initial current in αβγ-expressing cells. The addition of amiloride after long CHX treatments reduced the current to that measured in uninfected MDCK I cells (not shown). These data are consistent with the possibility that cells infected with α- and γ-mENaC express a single population of channels, whereas αβγ-expressing cells may assemble channels of multiple stoichiometries with distinct current decay profiles (e.g. αγ and αβγ). Alternatively, the current decay profile we observed for αβγ-expressing cells may reflect two distinct populations of αβγ channels: a rapidly decaying pool that turns over with kinetics similar to the channels in αγ-expressing cells and a residual long lived pool.Table ITime constants and residual currents in αβγ- versus αγ-expressing MDCK I cellsExperimentTime constantResidual Isc at 6 hαβγαγαβγαγh% t = 012.011.8743.57.023.722.5129.811.132.871.5631.87.042.132.6645.714.452.042.0143.47.4 Open table in a new tab The Current Decay Profile Is Independent of ENaC Expression Level—To determine whether the difference in current decay profile between αβγ- and αγ-expressing cells was related to the higher initial currents we typically observed in αβγ-expressing cells, we compared current decay profiles from multiple experiments with a range of initial currents. To maximize the overlap between αβγ and αγ starting currents, we limited our analysis to experiments in which the initial currents in αβγ-expressing cells were below 20 μA/cm2. Fig. 3A shows the raw current traces measured upon CHX addition to αγ-expressing cells (black lines) versus αβγ-expressing cells (gray lines). Normalization of the initial Isc in each trace to 100% (Fig. 3B) demonstrates that the difference between αβγ and αγ current decay profiles is independent of initial Isc. On average, we found that 45.1 ± 2.3% of initial Isc remained after 3 h of CHX treatment, and 30.9 ± 2.5% of base-line Isc remained after 6 h in αβγ-expressing cells (n = 13; mean ± S.E.). By contrast, currents dropped to 26.3 ± 2.4% and 9.3 ± 1.5% of the initial values in cells expressing only α- and γ-mENaC after 3 and 6 h of CHX treatment, respectively (n = 5). The variability in Isc that we observed between experiments could reflect differences in ENaC expression per cell or, alternatively, differences in AV infection efficiency. Therefore, to confirm that the current decay profile upon CHX addition was independent of cellular ENaC expression level, we used doxycycline (DOX) to regulate the amount of ENaC expressed in cells after viral infection. Cells were co-infected with AVs encoding all three subunits, and DOX (0.03 ng/ml) was added to some samples immediately upon removal of the AV. This treatment resulted in a marked decrease in the Isc measured the following day (Fig. 3C, t = 0). However, upon the addition of CHX, both the rate of current decay and the fraction of residual Isc remaining after 6 h of CHX treatment were similar in DOX-treated versus untreated cells (Fig. 3D). Thus, it is unlikely that the residual Isc reflects saturation of the cellular capacity to internalize or degrade ENaC. MDCK I Cells Express Undetectable Levels of Endogenous β-ENaC Subunit—We next considered the possibility that the Isc we observed in MDCK I cells infected with AVs encoding α- and γ-mENaC was due to assembly of these subunits with endogenous canine β-ENaC. Species-specific trafficking motifs in the canine β-ENaC sequence might then account for the distinct decay curves we obtained in cells expressing only α- and γ-mENaC. To examine whether endogenous ENaC mRNA is expressed in our MDCK I cells, we first employed RT-PCR using conserved ENaC primers designed against highly conserved nucleotide sequences in each subunit to amplify total RNA isolated from polarized MDCK I cells (Fig. 4A). Whereas we obtained a significant signal when RNA was amplified using β-ENaC-specific primers, only trace levels of α- and γ-ENaC RNA were detected. Based on the sequence of the amplified PCR product, a new 5′-specific primer and a degenerate 3′ primer against the 3′-untranslated region of β-ENaC were generated and used to amplify the carboxyl-terminal sequence of canine β-ENaC. Repeated attempts to clone the amino-terminal region were unsuccessful. The carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequences of canine ENaC and mENaC were highly homologous and did not differ within regions thought to be important in regulating ENaC trafficking or stability (Fig. 4B). We then examined whether endogenous β-ENaC protein could be immunoprecipitated from polarized MDCK I cells. Alignment of canine and rat/mouse β-ENaC sequences revealed only two amino acid differences within the region used to raise anti-peptide antibodies against rat/mouse ENaC (Fig. 4C). In addition, we used an antibody directed against a peptide from the C-terminal region of Xenopus β-ENaC to immunoprecipitate radiolabeled MDCK I cells. Canine and mouse β-ENaC are identical to one another within the peptide sequence used to generate the anti-xENaC antibody (Fig. 4C). However, whereas both anti-mouse and anti-Xenopus β-ENaC antibody readily immunoprecipitated AV-expressed β-mENaC, they failed to detect endogenous protein (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we could not detect endogenous β-ENaC in MDCK I cells upon immunoprecipitation with anti-Xenopus β-ENaC and subsequent Western blotting using the anti-rat/mouse β-ENaC antibody (Fig. 4D). A background band of ∼105 kDa was routinely observed; however, treatment of MDCK I immunoprecipitates with N-glycanase prior to gel electrophoresis and Western blotting revealed only a minor shift in the mobility of this band, inconsistent with the six potential N-glycosylation sites in our partial canine β-ENaC sequence. A band of similar molecular weight has previously been detected in MDCK cell lysates and dog kidney samples blotted using the same antibody (19Morris R.G. Schafer J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 71-85Google Scholar). We also observed a similar background band in MDCK lysates immunoprecipitated with and then blotted using anti-β-xENaC. 3J. R. Bruns and O. A. Weisz, unpublished observations. By contrast, AV-expressed β-mENaC was readily detected in MDCK cell lysates, and the mobility of this protein was markedly shifted by N-glycanase treatment. Finally, we examined whether a pool of endogenous β-ENaC might be stabilized upon infection with AVs encoding α- and γ-mENaC; however, no canine β-ENaC was detected in these cells (Fig. 4D). We conclude that whereas MDCK I cells express ENaC subunit mRNA, they have undetectable levels of ENaC subunit protein and channel activity. The Current Decay Profile of αβγ-ENaC Is Species-independent—We next considered whether the C-terminal epitope tags on β- (or γ-) mENaC might contribute to the residual current we observed in αβγ-mENaC-expressing cells. To test this, we co-infected MDCK I cells with AVs encoding α-mENaC and non-epitope-tagged β- and γ-xENaC. This combination of ENaC subunits typically generated currents comparable with those we observed in αβγ mENaC-expressing cells. The current decay profile upon the addition of CHX to these cells was similar to that typically observed in cells expressing only mENaC subunits, with roughly 60% of the initial current remaining at 3 h (Fig. 5A). By contrast, CHX addition to αγ-mENaC-expressing cells in the same experiment resulted in much a more rapid decay in Isc (∼70% decay in 3 h). Residual Current Correlates with β-mENaC Expression— Our data suggest that MDCK I cells expressing all three subunits contain at least two populations of ENaC channels: a rapidly decaying pool and a stable pool. One hypothesis is that the initial rapid current decay upon CHX treatment to αβγ-expressing cells represents the efficient turnover of a population of αγ channels in these cells, whereas the stable, residual current reflects the slow turnover of cell surface αβγ channels. Alternatively, all channels in αβγ-expressing cells may have the same stoichiometry, but a subpopulation may be resistant to turnover. A prediction of the first hypothesis is that increasing the relative amount of β-mENaC expression relative to α- and γ-mENaC might drive the assembly of αβγ channels, resulting in an increased fraction of residual Isc upon CHX treatment. To test this, we infected MDCK I cells with AVs encoding α- and γ-mENaC at an m.o.i. of 60 each as usual and varied the amount of AV encoding β-mENaC from an m.o.i. of 0–60. Isc in cells expressing no β-mENaC (Fig. 6, αγ) declined rapidly as expected with essentially no residual current after 6 h. The addition of AV-β-mENaC at an m.o.i. of 20 or 60 resulted in a progressive increase in both the initial Isc and in the fraction"
https://openalex.org/W2037821263,"The Xenopus polo-like kinase Plx1 plays important roles during entry into and exit from mitosis (M phase). Previous studies revealed that Plx1 is activated by phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues, and purification of an activating enzyme from mitotic Xenopus egg extracts led to cloning and characterization of Xenopus polo-like kinase kinase (xPlkk1), which can phosphorylate and activate Plx1 in vitro. In the present study, a positive feedback loop between Plx1 and xPlkk1 was shown to result in each kinase phosphorylating and activating the other. Sequencing of radiolabeled xPlkk1 after phosphorylation by Plx1 in vitro identified three phosphorylation sites each spaced three amino acids apart, two of which have the consensus acidic-X-pSer-hydrophobic described for other polo-like kinase substrates. In addition, endogenous xPlkk1 in oocytes was phosphorylated on these sites in M phase but not in interphase. A mutant xPlkk1 in which these three amino acids were changed to alanine (xPlkk1(SA3)) was unable to be phosphorylated or activated in vitro by Plxl. Depletion of Plx1 from oocyte extracts prior to stimulation of the G2/M transition blocked the activation of xPlkk1, but depletion of xPlkk1 before stimulation did not block Plx1 activation. These results indicate that xPlkk1 may function downstream as a target of Plx1 rather than as an upstream activating kinase during the G2/M transition.

These results indicate that xPlkk1 may function downstream as a target of Plx1 rather than as an upstream activating kinase during the G2/M transition. Studies in many laboratories have shown that entry into mitosis is controlled by the activation of cyclin B/Cdc2 following dephosphorylation of Tyr-15 in Cdc2 by the dual specificity phosphatase Cdc25C. Cdc25C itself is activated at the G2/M transition by phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues (1Izumi T. Walker D.H. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 927-939Google Scholar, 2Hoffmann I.

Although this activating phosphorylation can be performed by cyclin B/Cdc2 itself (forming a positive feedback loop), evidence in Xenopus eggs and extracts and in mammalian cells suggests that initial activation of Cdc25C depends on phosphorylation by a polo-like kinase (4Izumi T.

However, prior phosphorylation is not obligatory, because Plx1 can efficiently phosphorylate bacterially expressed Cdc25C (see Fig. 2C), which presumably is not phosphorylated. Other studies on the interaction of Plx1 and Cdc25C have shown that overexpression of activated Plx1 accelerates phosphorylation of Cdc25C (14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell.

Because Plx1 controls both the activation and deactivation of cyclin B/Cdc2, it is a major player in the control of mitosis. This has focused attention on the pathway of Plx1 activation.

However, overexpression of xPlkk1 in oocytes accelerates the activation of Plx1 and the Cdc25C-dependent G2/M transition (24Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Google Scholar). xPlkk1 itself could be deactivated by treatment with serine/threonine phosphatases, indicating the existence of a polo-like kinase kinase kinase (24Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Google Scholar). These results suggest that a protein kinase cascade regulates activation of Plx1. When characterizing any new protein kinase, it is highly desirable to generate gain-of-function mutants to probe specific functions of the kinase itself in the absence of complex upstream signaling pathways. For protein kinases activated by phosphorylation, one approach to generating gain-of-function mutants is to mutate sites of activating phosphorylation to acidic residues, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, where the negatively charged amino acid may mimic the effects of phosphorylation. Such an approach has been used previously to generate constitutively active forms of Plx1, Mek1, and p90Rsk (15Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell.

Site-directed mutagenesis of XPLKK1 cDNA was performed by the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) on nucleotides 1315–2229, which had been subcloned from pOTVF-XPLKK1 into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI). The three serine residues, 482, 490, and 486, were mutated to Ala in that order with the following pairs of oligonucleotides: 5′-GCATGGACATCGCAATGAATTTGTCTGCGG-3′ and 5′-CCGCAGACAAATTCATTGCGATGTCCATGC-3′; 5′-GTCTGCGGACCTGGCCATTAACAAGGAAACTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGTTTCCTTGTTAATGGCCAGGTCCGCAGAC-3′; 5′-CATCGCAATGAATTTGGCCGCGGACCTGGCCATTAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTAATGGCCAGGTCCGCGGCCAAATTCATTGCGATG-3′.

The mutated region was excised with the restriction enzymes AfeI and BbvCI (nucleotides 1323–1924) and ligated into AfeI-BbvCI-cut XPLKK1 or XPLKK1(N162A) in the vector pOTVF to generate pOTVF-XPLKK1(SA3) and pOTVF-XPLKK1(NA;SA3), respectively. mRNAs were transcribed from these pOTVF constructs with the use of the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The full-length XPLKK1(SA3) and XPLKK1(NA;SA3) cDNAs were then subcloned into pVLFH. All cDNAs were fully sequenced to confirm the relevant mutations and the absence of incidental mutations. Plx1 and xPlkk1 proteins expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were isolated with TALON metal-affinity resin (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and eluted. Plx1 proteins were further purified by hydroxyapatite (CHT-1; Bio-Rad) and MonoS (HR5/5; Amersham Biosciences) chromatography, and the xPlkk1 proteins were further purified by MonoS chromatography. The basal specific activity of xPlkk1(SA3) was similar to that of xPlkk1, 2 nmol/min/mg, with myelin basic protein (MBP) as the substrate. Where indicated, the Sf9 cells were treated with 100 nm okadaic acid for 3 h prior to harvest to generate highly active enzymes (5Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9831-9835Google Scholar). Preparation of affinity-purified antibodies against Plx1 and xPlkk1 and of control IgGs depleted of antibody against Plx1 or xPlkk1 was as described previously (14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Google Scholar, 24Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Google Scholar). The purified xPlkk1 antibody was suitable for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation but proved unsuitable for immune-complex kinase assays. G2/prophase oocyte extracts were depleted of Plx1 or xPlkk1 by incubation with antibody covalently coupled to Affi-Prep protein A support beads (6Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Taieb F.E. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1791-1799Google Scholar). Phosphorylation Reactions—Samples were incubated at 30 °C in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Brij-35). For phosphorylation of Plx1 and xPlkk1, the kinase buffer was supplemented with 100 μg of ovalbumin/ml and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2–4 cpm/fmol). Reactions were stopped by the addition of one-fourth volume of 5× concentrated sample buffer, incubated at 95 °C for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and autoradiography. For activation experiments, Plx1 and xPlkk1 were preincubated together in 10 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP. At the indicated times, the samples were removed, added to kinase buffer supplemented with 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2–4 cpm/fmol), and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min with MBP (500 μg/ml) for xPlkk1 or Cdc25C (residues 1–264) (16.7 μg/ml) for Plx1. The reactions were analyzed as described above, and incorporation of radiolabel was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry of the excised gel bands. For identification of phosphorylation sites, 1 μg of Plk1 and 2 μg of xPlkk1 were incubated together for 30 min in a total volume of 60 μlin kinase buffer supplemented with 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10–15 cpm/fmol). Under these conditions incorporation of phosphate into xPlkk1 was ∼15 mol/mol. It proved necessary to remove radiolabeled Plx1 from the sample because radiolabeled peptides from Plx1 interfered with identification of peptides from xPlkk1. To accomplish this, the reaction was stopped by the addition of one-eighth volume of 5× concentrated sample buffer and incubated at 95 °C for 3 min. The sample was diluted with 15 volumes of buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), supplemented with 10 μg of anti-xPlkk1 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were adsorbed to Protein A beads and washed several times with kinase buffer. Radiolabeled xPlkk1 on the beads was cleaved with cyanogen bromide, and the peptides were eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The sample was then subjected to Edman degradation, and release of radioactivity was monitored at each cycle. The results were analyzed by the cleavage of a radiolabeled protein program (fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/crp/) (33MacDonald J.A. Mackey A.J. Pearson W.R. Haystead T.A.J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 314-322Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Google Scholar). Phosphospecific antisera (anti-xPlkk1–3P sera) against a peptide phosphorylated on all three phosphorylation sites were prepared by PhosphoSolutions (Aurora, CO). For preliminary characterization of these sera, xPlkk1(NA) was phosphorylated by Plx1(OA) as described above for the identification of phosphorylation sites, but the specific activity of the ATP was 650 cpm/pmol. Affinity-purified antibodies were prepared from these sera on a column containing the triply phosphorylated peptide. A Feedback Loop Between xPlkk1 and Plx1—Initial studies on the characterization of both Plx1 and xPlkk1 showed that both enzymes undergo autophosphorylation (14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Google Scholar, 24Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Google Scholar). Further analysis of reactions containing both Plx1 and xPlkk1 revealed greatly increased phosphorylation of each enzyme in the presence of the other (Fig. 1, lanes 1–3). The effect was much larger for xPlkk1 than for Plx1. The phosphorylation of Plx1 by xPlkk1 has been shown previously to activate Plx1 (24Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Google Scholar). To assess the effect of phosphorylation of xPlkk1 by Plx1 on its activity, xPlkk1 was preincubated with highly active Plx1, and its phosphotransferase activity was quantified. Time course studies demonstrated that xPlkk1 was activated by Plx1-dependent phosphorylation in a manner additive with activation due to autophosphorylation (Fig. 2). Activation was completely dependent on the presence of ATP during the preincubation (data not shown). The Plx1 used in these experiments was highly active enzyme purified from okadaic acid-treated Sf9 cells; identical results were obtained when a constitutively active mutant of Plx1, Plx1(T201D), was used (data not shown). In addition, Fig. 2C confirms that xPlkk1 can activate Plx1 invitro (24Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Google Scholar). Importantly, these results demonstrate that Plx1 phosphorylates activating sites in xPlkk1 in vitro. Since xPlkk1 was originally purified on the basis of phosphorylation and activation of Plx1 (24Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Google Scholar), this result suggests that a positive feedback loop exists between xPlkk1 and Plx1 in which each kinase is able to phosphorylate and activate the other. To identify the phosphorylation sites that activate xPlkk1 under these conditions, the enzyme was phosphorylated to near completion with Plx1 in vitro. A stoichiometry near 15 mol phosphate/mol xPlkk1 was observed after 30 min of incubation. The radiolabeled xPlkk1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation and cleaved with cyanogen bromide. Simultaneous Edman degradation of the labeled peptides was correlated with cycles of 32P release, and an algorithm analysis was used to assign cycles of 32P release to specific sites (33MacDonald J.A. Mackey A.J. Pearson W.R. Haystead T.A.J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 314-322Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, three sites of phosphorylation were identified, Ser-482, -486, and -490. The same sites were identified in catalytically inactive xPlkk1 that had been phosphorylated by Plx1 (data not shown) and thus were not due to autophosphorylation of xPlkk1. Two of these sites are conserved in the related mammalian kinases, Stk10, SLK, and LOK (25Walter S.A. Cutler Jr., R.E. Martinez R. Gishizky M. Hill R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18221-18228Google Scholar, 26Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Karasuyama H. Yamada E. Tsujikawa K. Todokoro K. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 491-498Google Scholar, 34Kuramochi S. Moriguchi T. Kuida K. Endo J. Semba K. Nishida E. Karasuyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22679-22684Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation of these sites is necessary for activation, these three amino acids were all changed to Ala, the mutant enzyme (xPlkk1(SA3)) was expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, and its ability to be phosphorylated and activated by Plx1 was assessed. As shown in Fig. 4, the ability of Plx1 to both phosphorylate and activate xPlkk1(SA3) in vitro was greatly reduced. xPlkk1 Phosphorylation in Vivo during Oocyte Maturation— During oocyte maturation xPlkk1 becomes highly phosphorylated, as judged by retarded mobility upon SDS-PAGE (24Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Google Scholar). To investigate the phosphorylation of these three serine sites of xPlkk1 in a physiologically relevant system, we generated a phosphospecific antibody against a peptide triply phosphorylated at Ser-482, -486, and -490. Western blots show that this antibody recognizes xPlkk1 phosphorylated by Plx1 but not unphosphorylated xPlkk1 or autophosphorylated xPlkk1 (Fig. 5A). This situation is analogous to that of phosphorylase kinase, where activating sites phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase are distinct from the sites involved in activation by autophosphorylation (35Sul H.S. Cooper R.H. Whitehouse S. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3484-3490Google Scholar). Moreover, in oocytes expressing ectopic xPlkk1, this antibody recognized xPlkk1 from M-phase (GVBD) oocytes but not from G2-phase oocytes (Fig. 5B). This antibody could also detect phosphorylation of endogenous xPlkk1 at these sites (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, a second protein that migrated with a slightly lower Mr than xPlkk1 was also recognized by this antibody in M-phase. This could represent an xPlkk1 degradation product not recognized by our anti-xPlkk1 antibody (Fig. 7C). These results indicate that phosphorylation at these sites occurs in vivo during the G2/M transition and are consistent with previous evidence that both Plx1 and xPlkk1 are phosphorylated/activated in M-phase oocytes (14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Google Scholar, 24Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Google Scholar).Fig. 7Effect of depletion of Plx1 on the phosphorylation of xPlkk1. Samples of a G2-phase extract were incubated with either anti-Plx1 antibody-coupled beads (Plx1 IgG) or anti-Plx1-depleted antibody-coupled beads (control IgG) and then supplemented with PKI or with PKI plus recombinant Plx1 (Plx1 IgG + Plx1). The samples were frozen at the indicated times and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples were immunoblotted for Plx1 (A) and assayed for histone H1 kinase activity (B). C, samples were immunoblotted with affinity-purified anti-xPlkk1–3P (upper panel) and anti-xPlkk1 (lower panel) antibodies. Exposure was for 4 min. Lanes Un and Ph, unphosphorylated and phosphorylated xPlkk1(NA) standards, respectively. Prestained molecular mass markers (in kDa) are indicated on the right, and the position of xPlkk1 is indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These results identify a feedback loop between Plx1 and xPlkk1 in which each kinase can phosphorylate and activate the other. In any positive feedback loop, it can be difficult to determine upstream/downstream relationships. To further elucidate the relationship between these two enzymes, we examined their activity in extracts from G2-phase oocytes. Upon treatment with the heat-stable inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKI, these extracts initiate the key molecular events that occur at the G2/M transition during oocyte maturation, including activation of Plx1, Cdc25C, and cyclin B/Cdc2 histone H1 kinase activity (6Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Taieb F.E. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1791-1799Google Scholar, 32Shibuya E.K. Polverino A.J. Chang E. Wigler M. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9831-9835Google Scholar). An advantage of this system is that it makes immunodepletion/reconstitution experiments feasible, and previously this approach was used to establish that the activation of Cdc25C is dependent on Plx1 (6Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Taieb F.E. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1791-1799Google Scholar). Thus, we immunodepleted xPlkk1 and assessed the effect on activation of Plx1, and conversely, we immunodepleted Plx1 and assessed the effect on the phosphorylation of xPlkk1. As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, depletion of xPlkk1 did not prevent activation of either Plx1 or histone H1 kinase activity. In contrast, immunodepletion of Plx1 did prevent activation of histone H1 kinase activity (Fig. 7B), as shown previously (6Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Taieb F.E. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1791-1799Google Scholar), and moreover, phosphorylation of xPlkk1 was impaired (Fig. 7C). Both of these effects were reversed by the addition of recombinant Plx1 to the depleted extract. Together, these results demonstrated that xPlkk1 is not required for the activation of Plx1 and suggested that it may instead be a downstream target of Plx1, at least during the G2/M transition. Evidence indicates Plx1 and xPlkk1 can be co-immunoprecipitated from M-phase extracts, and both kinases are localized on the mitotic spindle (data not shown), suggesting this feedback loop is likely to operate in a supramolecular “module” in M phase, analogous to the assembly of multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade components on a Ste5 scaffold (36Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Google Scholar). The three sites of phosphorylation identified are likely to be necessary for activation because the SA3 mutant of xPlkk1 was unable to be activated in vitro by purified Plx1. However, when these same three phosphorylation sites were mutated to either Asp or Glu, the enzyme expressed in Sf9 cells was not highly active (data not shown). Therefore, in this case, substitution of even a multiple phosphorylated residue(s) with an acidic residue(s) does not result in a constitutively active enzyme. Given the high stoichiometry of phosphorylation of xPlkk1 by Plx1, it seems likely that additional phosphorylation sites in xPlkk1 contribute to activity. It is of some interest that the three sites identified are spaced at intervals of four amino acids (Fig. 3). Two of these sites fit the consensus acidic-X-pSer-hydrophobic, which has been determined for several other substrates of polo-like kinases (37Zhou T. Aumais J.P. Liu X. Yu-Lee L.Y. Erikson R.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 127-138Google Scholar, 38Alexandru G. Uhlmann F. Mechtler K. Poupart M.A. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2001; 105: 459-472Google Scholar, 39Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Nishida E.

However, other phosphorylation sites that do not fit this paradigm have also been documented in substrates of polo-like kinases (41Yarm F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6209-6221Google Scholar, 42Liu X. Zhou T. Kuriyama R. Erikson R.L. J. Cell Sci. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). A similar pattern of phosphorylation at four-amino acid intervals has been reported for the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (43Zhang W. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 219-225Google Scholar, 44Fiol C.J. Wang A. Raeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6061-6065Google Scholar). In that case, the enzyme recognizes phosphoserine as part of its consensus motif. It seems unlikely that Plx1 also recognizes phosphoserine as part of its consensus motif, because there is no serine residue in xPlkk1 downstream of Ser-490 in the appropriate position (Fig. 3). Further work is necessary to determine whether the phosphorylation of xPlkk1 by Plx1 is ordered and to assess the relative contribution of each of the phosphorylation sites to enzyme activity. In summary, the results in this paper identify Plx1 as a relevant activating kinase for xPlkk1 and identify sites of phosphorylation in xPlkk1 required for activation. The identification of protein kinases that function physiologically as upstream polo-like kinase kinases remains an important avenue for further work.

https://openalex.org/W1992872235,"The unique structures of human choriogonadotropin (hCG) and related glycoprotein hormones make them well suited for studies of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. hCG is stabilized by a strand of its β-subunit that has been likened to a “seatbelt” because it surrounds α-subunit loop 2 and its end is “latched” by an intrasubunit disulfide bond to the β-subunit core. As shown here, assembly begins when parts of the NH2 terminus, cysteine knot, and loops 1 and 3 of the α-subunit dock reversibly with parts of the NH2 terminus, cystine knot, and loop 2 of the hCG β-subunit. Whereas the seatbelt can contribute to the stability of the docked subunit complex, it interferes with docking and/or destabilizes the docked complex when it is unlatched. This explains why most hCG is assembled by threading the glycosylated end of α-subunit loop 2 beneath the latched seatbelt rather than by wrapping the unlatched seatbelt around this loop. hCG assembly appears to be limited by the need to disrupt the disulfide that stabilizes the small seatbelt loop prior to threading. We postulate that assembly depends on a “zipper-like” sequential formation of intersubunit and intrasubunit hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms of several residues in the β-subunit cystine knot, α-subunit loop 2, and the small seatbelt loop. The resulting intersubunit β-sheet enhances the stability of the seatbelt loop disulfide, which shortens the seatbelt and secures the heterodimer. Formation of this disulfide also explains the ability of the seatbelt loop to facilitate latching during assembly by the wraparound pathway.

Gonadotropins and thyrotropins are structurally related glycoprotein hormone heterodimers in which a loop of their α-subunits is surrounded by a strand of their β-subunits like a “seatbelt” (1Lapthorn A.J.

With the exception of some teleost fish follitropins, the seatbelts of most vertebrate hormones is “latched” by an intrasubunit disulfide to a cysteine in the β-subunit core. The unusual structures of these heterodimers and the fact that their assembly can be studied within cells makes them useful for identifying factors that affect protein folding in the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; α1, α2, α3, α-subunit loops 1, 2, 3; β1, β2, β3, β-subunit loops 1, 2, 3; hCG, human choriogonadotropin; hFSH, human follitropin; hTSH, human thyrotropin; teFSH, teleost FSH found in salmon and related species in which the seatbelt is latched to a cysteine in the NH2-terminal end of the β-subunit.

Assembly of most hCG, hFSH, and hTSH in the ER occurs after the seatbelt is latched by a process in which the glycosylated end of loop α2 is “threaded” through a hole in the β-subunit (17Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35426-35436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This process is facilitated by disruption of a disulfide that we have termed the “tensor” because it stabilizes a small loop within the seatbelt that regulates its length (18Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35437-35448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Disruption of the tensor disulfide prior to assembly enlarges the hole in the β-subunit and facilitates threading; reformation of the tensor disulfide following threading tightens the seatbelt around loop α2, which stabilizes the heterodimer. Alternatively, the hCG heterodimer can be assembled by a process in which the seatbelt is wrapped around loop α2 before the seatbelt latch disulfide is formed; formation of the seatbelt latch disulfide completes assembly. The “wrapping” mechanism, which was first proposed on the basis of pulse-chase analysis (4Ruddon R.W. Sherman S.A. Bedows E. Protein Sci. 1996; 8: 1443-1452Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), appears to be used infrequently relative to the threading pathway for hCG assembly. Wrapping is required for assembly of hCG analogs in which the seatbelt is latched to a cysteine in the NH2-terminal end of the β-subunit, a site comparable with that of the FSH β-subunit found in salmon and many other teleost fish (19Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35449-35457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is also required for the assembly of heterodimers in which the seatbelt is latched to the α-subunit (5Xing Y. Lin W. Jiang M. Myers R.V. Cao D. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46953-46960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Studies described here were designed to learn why most hCG is assembled by a threading mechanism rather than a wraparound mechanism. Conceivably, the latched seatbelt is a component of the subunit docking site. As a result, formation of the seatbelt latch disulfide would increase the affinity of the β-subunit for the α-subunit, thereby facilitating assembly by a threading route. Alternatively, the unlatched hCG seatbelt might occupy positions near the subunit interface where it would be in a position to interfere with subunit docking or where it can destabilize the docked complex. This would reduce the amount of docked complex and interfere with assembly by a wraparound route. The finding that the end of the seatbelt scans the β-subunit to find its latch site (18Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35437-35448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) supports the notion that the seatbelt could contact the subunit interface. Efforts to distinguish these possibilities led us to study how the hCG α- and β-subunits dock and to determine how the latching of the seatbelt affected this process.Using intersubunit disulfide bonds to stabilize partially assembled intermediates, we found that the hCG β-subunit docks with the α-subunit in similar but not identical fashions when its seatbelt is latched or unlatched. Most docked complexes appear to dissociate before the heterodimer can be assembled by either pathway, a phenomenon that would favor threading by providing more time for the β-subunit to latch its seatbelt. Furthermore, the unlatched seatbelt appears to hinder docking and/or promote dissociation of the docked complex, a phenomenon that would also favor threading. By comparing the apparent positions of the subunits in the docked complexes with the structures of the assembled heterodimers, we devised models of heterodimer assembly. These suggest that while both threading and wrapping depend on the formation of similar intrasubunit and intersubunit hydrogen bonds, these would appear to form more readily by threading when the seatbelt is latched than by wrapping when it is unlatched.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructs used in these studies are illustrated in Fig. 1 and were produced by standard methods of site-directed mutagenesis (17Xing Y.

Chem. 2004; 279: 35426-35436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, most heterodimers were captured to microtiter plates using an antibody (A113) to the α-subunit and detected using a radioiodinated antibody (B110 or B111) to the β-subunit. Molecular modeling and cartoon illustrations were prepared with the aid of the programs Sybyl (Tripos, St. Louis, MO) and Sculpt (MDL Information Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA).RESULTSThe Subunits Dock in Similar but Not Identical Fashions When the Seatbelt Is Latched and Unlatched—We employed a disulfide scanning mutagenesis strategy to identify portions of the subunits that are likely to contact one another when the seatbelt is unlatched or when the tensor disulfide is disrupted. These are key intermediates in the wraparound and threading pathways, respectively (17Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35426-35436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The analogs used were derivatives of β-subunits that cannot latch their seatbelts (i.e. hCGβ-C26A,C110A) or form the tensor disulfide (i.e. hCGβ-C93A,C100A). While neither was capable of being assembled into stable heterodimers with the native α-subunit (6Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both were incorporated into heterodimers that are cross-linked by an intersubunit disulfide (Fig. 2). This property formed the basis of our strategy for identifying portions of the subunits likely to contact one another during assembly. We assumed that the ability of a disulfide to “rescue” complexes containing docked subunits that cannot otherwise be assembled into a heterodimer would be proportional to the time that its component cysteines are adjacent. Based on our expectation that contacts between the α-subunit and these β-subunit analogs during wrapping and threading would be at least somewhat similar to those in the heterodimer, we introduced cysteines into each subunit at sites that were capable of cross-linking the heterodimer. This approach may have caused us to overlook transient contacts that do not lead to assembly, but these were of lesser interest for these studies.Several intersubunit disulfides have been used to cross-link the subunits of hCG (7Heikoop J.C. van den Boogaart P. Mulders J.W.M. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Nat. Biotech. 1997; 15: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Einstein M. Lin W. Macdonald G.J. Moyle W.R. Exp. Biol. Med. 2001; 226: 581-590Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and we selected a few others by measuring the distances between the Cα carbons and between the Cβ carbons of every residue in the α- and β-subunits (not shown). We assumed that the most favorable disulfides would be at positions in which the maximum distances between these atoms would be ∼6–6.5 and 3.8–4.2 Å, respectively. Based on these considerations, we substituted cysteines for residues in the hCG α- and β-subunits to produce heterodimers having the potential to form the following disulfides: αQ5C-βR8C, αQ27C-βV44C, αV76C-βV44C, αC7S-βY37C, αR35C-βA35C, αY37C-βI33C, and αK51C-βD99C (Fig. 1). Note that the conversion of αCys7 to serine in α-C7S disrupted its ability to form an intra-subunit disulfide between α-subunit residues 7 and 31. The resulting free α-subunit cysteine (i.e. αCys31) can form a disulfide with the cysteine introduced into the β-subunit in place of hCG-βTyr37 (8Einstein M. Lin W. Macdonald G.J. Moyle W.R. Exp. Biol. Med. 2001; 226: 581-590Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As described next, each of these analogs formed cross-linked heterodimers that were stable at pH 2, 37 °C, a condition known to promote hCG dissociation (9Aloj S.M. Edelhock H. Ingham K.C. Morgan F.J. Canfield R.E. Ross G.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 159: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Formation of these disulfides in complexes lacking the abilities to latch their seatbelts or to stabilize the small seatbelt loop indicated that these portions of the subunits were also adjacent at some time during the period in which the subunits were docked to one another.Fig. 1Constructs used in these studies. The amino acid sequences of the constructs used in these studies are shown here. Residues above the sequence indicate amino acid substitutions. For example, α-Q5C represents an analog in which α-subunit residue αGln5 is converted to cysteine. Several analogs contain two or more substitutions. For example, hCGβ-C26A,C110A represents an analog in which both βCys26 and βCys110 are converted to alanine. As indicated by the bracket, hCGβ-δ(93:100)DA represents an analog in which all the residues in the tensor loop are replaced by aspartic acid and alanine. hCGβ-δ(93:100)DA,C26A is an analog of hCGβ-δ(93:100)DA in which βCys26 is converted to alanine, a mutation that prevents it from latching its seatbelt to loop β1. δ1,7hCGβ refers to an analog lacking residues 1–7 and that has an arginine at its N terminus (i.e. corresponding to hCG βArg8). δ2,8hCGβ is a construct encoding an hCGβ analog missing residues 2–8. This analog has a serine at its NH2 terminus (i.e. corresponding to hCG βSer1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To learn how interactions between the NH2-terminal portions of the subunits might affect subunit docking, we studied the formation of analogs that were cross-linked by the α5-β8 disulfide. Co-expression of α-Q5C and hCGβ-R8C led to the formation of an acid-stable heterodimer, indicating that it contained an intersubunit disulfide. When α-Q5C was co-expressed with hCGβ-R8C,C26A,C110A and hCGβ-R8C,C93A, C100A, β-subunits that cannot latch their seatbelts or form their tensor disulfides, respectively, we observed that 125 and 39% as much heterodimer was formed as that containing hCGβ-R8C (Fig. 2, left and right). This showed that an intersubunit disulfide had formed between the NH2-terminal ends of the α- and β-subunits while the subunits were docked with one another, even though the seatbelt latch and tensor disulfides could not be formed. It also revealed that the NH2-terminal portions of both types of β-subunits appear to contact the NH2-terminal portions of the α-subunit during subunit docking. The relative differences in the amounts of cross-linked docked subunits observed are impossible to interpret, however. They might indicate that contacts between the NH2-terminal ends of the subunits are favored more when the seatbelt is unlatched than when the tensor disulfide is disrupted. Then again, they might also reflect the tendency of seatbelt residue βCys110 to form a disulfide with βCys8 in hCGβ-R8C,C93A,C100A (18Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35437-35448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which would have rendered βCys8 incapable of forming an intersubunit disulfide with αCys5. Consequently, only that fraction of hCGβ-R8C,C93A,C100A in which the seatbelt is latched to βCys26 would be capable of being cross-linked by a disulfide.Parts of loop β2 contact loops α1 and α3 in hCG (1Lapthorn A.J.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To learn if these portions of the hCG β-subunit might participate in docking, we tested the abilities of cysteines that had been introduced in place of loop α1 residue αQ27C and loop α3 residue αV76C to form intersubunit disulfides with β-subunit analogs that contain a cysteine in place of hCG loop β2 residue βV44C. Co-expression of α-Q27C or α-V76C with hCGβ-V44C led to the formation of cross-linked heterodimers, all of which were acid stable. The α27-β44 and α76-β44 disulfides each stabilized 28% of the complexes containing the β-subunit that cannot latch its seatbelt. They were not as effective as the disulfide in the subunit NH2 termini (Fig. 2, left). This suggested that when the hCG seatbelt is unlatched, the subunits dock in orientations that favor the formation of NH2-terminal contacts relative to those between loop β2 and loops α1 and α3.The α27-β44 disulfide also rescued heterodimers that are unable to form the tensor disulfide. As a result, co-expression of α-Q27C and hCGβ-V44C,C93A,C100A led to 54% as much heterodimer that was formed when α-Q27C was expressed with hCGβ-V44C (Fig. 2, right). This was as good or better than the α5-β8 disulfide (i.e. 39%). Remarkably, the α76-β44 disulfide between αV76C in loop α3 and βV44C in loop β2 did not rescue docked complexes containing hCGβ-V44C,C93A,C100A (Fig. 2, right), an observation that remains puzzling. We did not expect to find that the α27-β44 disulfide would rescue docked complexes containing β-subunits that cannot form their tensor disulfides better than those that cannot latch their seatbelts. This was because hCGβ-V44C,C93A,C100A has the potential to latch its seatbelt to βCys44 and, as a consequence, this cysteine would not be capable of being cross-linked to residue αCys27 in α-Q27C. In contrast, it is not possible for hCGβ-C26A,V44C,C110A to latch its seatbelt to βCys44. Thus, the lower ability of the α27-β44 disulfide to rescue docked complexes containing an unlatched seatbelt may indicate that before it is latched, the seatbelt may impede the formation of contacts between the loops α1 and α3 with loop β2.We studied potential contacts between loop α2 and either the cystine knot or loop β1 using analogs that can form intersubunit disulfide bonds between residues α35-β35 and α37-β33. Both disulfides have been shown to cross-link the subunits in hCG (7Heikoop J.C. van den Boogaart P. Mulders J.W.M. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Nat. Biotech. 1997; 15: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Each rescued docked complexes containing β-subunits having latched seatbelts and disrupted tensor disulfides better than complexes containing β-subunits with unlatched seatbelts and intact tensor disulfides. Thus, the α35-β35 disulfide rescued 66% of the heterodimer containing α-R35C and hCGβ-A35C,C93A,C100A (Fig. 2, right), but only 8.5% of the heterodimer containing α-R35C and hCGβ-C26A,A35C,C110A (Fig. 2, left). The α37-β33 disulfide rescued 25% of the heterodimer containing α-Y37C and hCGβ-I33C,C93A,C100A (Fig. 2, right), but only 3.9% of the heterodimer containing α-Y37C and hCGβ-C26A,I33C,C110A (Fig. 2, left). The observations that the α35-β35 and α37-β33 disulfides formed more readily in analogs of hCGβ-C93A,C100A, which have latched seatbelts and disrupted tensor disulfides (Fig. 2, right), than in analogs of hCGβ-C26A,C110A, which have unlatched seatbelts and intact tensor disulfides (Fig. 2, left), suggested that loop α2 residues αArg35 and αTyr37 are more highly constrained during threading than wrapping. This would lead to increased contacts between the subunits, which would be expected to increase the stability of the docked complex.Efforts to detect other potential contacts that might stabilize the docked complex prior to assembly by the wraparound pathway led us to test the ability of the α31-β37 disulfide to secure the heterodimer. This disulfide was found to stabilize an hCG analog formed by co-expressing hCGβ-Y37C with α-C7A (8Einstein M. Lin W. Macdonald G.J. Moyle W.R. Exp. Biol. Med. 2001; 226: 581-590Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and was observed to rescue 15.6% of this material when hCGβ-C26A,Y37C,C110A was co-expressed with α-C7S (Fig. 2, right). We did not repeat these studies with analogs that are unable to form the tensor loop, because disulfides on either side of α31-β37 (i.e. α27-β44, α35-β35, and α37-β33) had already been found to rescue a much larger fraction of the heterodimer (Fig. 2, right). Considered together, these studies indicated that contacts near the cystine knots were likely to make a greater contribution to the threading pathway than to the wraparound pathway. The finding that these areas of the subunits are less likely to contact one another when the seatbelt is unlatched may reflect the ability of the unlatched seatbelt to disrupt contacts between the subunits, a topic to be considered later.We anticipated that the seatbelt would make extensive contacts with residues in loop α2 during the threading pathway and that we would not be able to distinguish these from contacts made during docking. Indeed, we had already found that disulfide bonds appear to form between unpaired cysteines in loop α2 and the tensor disulfides during threading (18Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35437-35448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To identify contacts between the seatbelt and the α-subunit that might facilitate docking in the wraparound pathway, we took advantage of a disulfide that forms between the seatbelt and loop α2, i.e. α51-β99 (7Heikoop J.C. van den Boogaart P. Mulders J.W.M. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Nat. Biotech. 1997; 15: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Einstein M. Lin W. Macdonald G.J. Moyle W.R. Exp. Biol. Med. 2001; 226: 581-590Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This disulfide rescued heterodimers containing α-K51C with hCGβ-C26A,D99C,C110A to 25.8% of the level observed when α-K51C was co-expressed with hCGβ-D99C (Fig. 2, left). This suggested that the tensor loop can participate in contacts with loop α2 while the seatbelt is unlatched. As noted later, we anticipate that hydrogen bonds between the backbone atoms of loop α2 residues αVal53-αGlu56 and seatbelt residues βThr98-βGly101, which include part of the tensor loop, are necessary for efficient completion of assembly by the wraparound pathway. These contacts do not appear to stabilize NH2-terminal portions of loop α2 that contact the β-subunit cystine knot, however, because analogs that are unable to latch their seatbelts were not rescued effectively by the α31-β37, α35-β35, or α37-β33 disulfides (Fig. 2, left).The abilities of intersubunit disulfides to rescue docked complexes containing β-subunits that cannot latch their seatbelts or form the tensor disulfide suggest that the manner in which subunits dock is similar but nonidentical during assembly by threading and wrapping mechanisms. The finding that the α5-β8 disulfide rescued the formation of both types of heterodimers supported the notion that contacts in the NH2-terminal region are important for the assembly of hCG and other lutropins. This is consistent with the observation that deletion of residues in the NH2 terminus of the β-subunit reduced secretion of hCG analogs in which the seatbelt is latched normally (10Huang J. Chen F. Puett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9311-9315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Slaughter S. Wang Y.H. Myers R.V. Moyle W.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).The ability of the α5-β8 disulfide to stabilize heterodimers lacking the abilities to latch their seatbelts suggested that contacts between the NH2-terminal portions of the subunits may have a dominant role during assembly by the wraparound pathway. To test this possibility, we monitored the abilities of analogs to form cross-linked heterodimers during assembly that can occur only by the wraparound pathway (Table I). Elimination of residues 1–7 or 2–8 reduced heterodimer secretion substantially (Table I). They also reduced assembly of heterodimers in which the seatbelt is latched to either α-subunit residue 37 (Table I, study 1) or to α-subunit residue 43 (Table I, study 2). This suggests that NH2-terminal contacts are likely to have a role in subunit docking even though they are not essential for docking.Table IInfluence of NH2 terminal hCGβ residues 1–7 and 2–8 on heterodimer assembly by threading and wraparound pathwaysData rowα-Subunitβ-SubunitTotal heterodimerng/50 μll ± S.E.Study 1, seatbelt latched to β26 or α371NativehCGβ14.73 ± 0.052Nativeδ1,7-hCGβ1.30 ± 0.023α-Y37ChCGβ-C26A5.92 ± 0.234α-Y37Cδ1,7-hCGβ-C26A<0.1Study 2, seatbelt latched to β26 or α435NativehCGβ27.75 ± 2.936Nativeδ1,7-hCGβ1.64 ± 0.097Nativeδ2,8-hCGβ<0.18α-S43ChCGβ-C26A7.56 ± 0.109α-S43Cδ1,7-hCGβ-C26A2.04 ± 0.13 Open table in a new tab The contribution of NH2-terminal contacts to assembly may explain our inability to detect assembly of hTSH and hFSH by a wraparound mechanism. These β-subunits have only one and two residues in their NH2-terminal ends, respectively. Therefore, the finding that hTSH and hFSH were unable to form heterodimers by a wraparound mechanism (17Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35426-35436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) may indicate that contacts between the NH2-terminal portions of both subunits are more important for assembly by a wrapping mechanism than for assembly by threading.Docking Is Readily Reversible, a Phenomenon That May Delay Most hCG Assembly Until the Seatbelt Is Latched—Experiments described next were performed during efforts to identify rate-limiting steps in glycoprotein hormone assembly and thereby learn why most hCG is assembled by a threading mechanism. These studies depended on our abilities to identify the relative rates of subunit docking, threading, and wrapping in the ER. We monitored these processes using the α5-β8 disulfide because of its ability to trap and rescue docked complexes in which the seatbelt is unlatched, a phenomenon that was required to detect early stages in the wraparound pathway. During these studies we compared the abilities of hCGβ to compete with hCGβ-R8C and hCGβ-R8C,C26A,C110A for α-Q5C for heterodimer formation. We reasoned that if threading or wrapping were not rate-limiting and occurred immediately after the subunits dock, then hCGβ would compete efficiently with hCGβ-R8C or hCGβ-R8C,C26A,C110A for heterodimer formation. Consequently, a substantial fraction of the heterodimer formed in the presence of hCGβ would lack an intersubunit disulfide and dissociate at pH 2, 37 °C. In contrast, if the subunits docked and undocked faster than the heterodimer became stabilized by threading or wrapping mechanisms, then hCGβ-R8C and hCGβ-R8C,C26A,C110A would constitute most of the β-subunit in the heterodimer.
