https://openalex.org/W2978904081,"Protein trafficking requires coat complexes that couple recognition of sorting motifs in transmembrane cargoes with biogenesis of transport carriers. The mechanisms of cargo transport through the endosomal network are poorly understood. Here, we identify a sorting motif for endosomal recycling of cargoes, including the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor and semaphorin 4C, by the membrane tubulating BAR domain-containing sorting nexins SNX5 and SNX6. Crystal structures establish that this motif folds into a β-hairpin, which binds a site in the SNX5/SNX6 phox homology domains. Over sixty cargoes share this motif and require SNX5/SNX6 for their recycling. These include cargoes involved in neuronal migration and a Drosophila snx6 mutant displays defects in axonal guidance. These studies identify a sorting motif and provide molecular insight into an evolutionary conserved coat complex, the 'Endosomal SNX-BAR sorting complex for promoting exit 1' (ESCPE-1), which couples sorting motif recognition to the BAR-domain-mediated biogenesis of cargo-enriched tubulo-vesicular transport carriers."

https://openalex.org/W2979126146,"Objective Although previous studies have reported a negative relationship between serum bilirubin concentration and the development of diabetes mellitus (DM), the relationship between bilirubin and insulin resistance has not been thoroughly assessed. This study was designed to determine the relationships between bilirubin, body fat distribution, and adipose tissue inflammation in patients with type 2 DM and the effect of bilirubin in an obese animal model. Method Body fat distribution was measured using an abdominal dual bioelectrical impedance analyzer in patients with type 2 DM. We also measured glycemic control, lipid profile, serum bilirubin concentration and other clinical characteristics, and determined their relationships with body fat distribution. In the animal study, biliverdin (20 mg/kg daily) was orally administered to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese (DIO) mice for 2 weeks, after which intraperitoneal insulin tolerance testing was performed. Then, adipocyte area, adipocytokine expression, and macrophage polarization were evaluated in epididymal adipose tissues. Results In the clinical study, univariate analysis showed that a lower bilirubin concentration was significantly correlated with higher body mass index, waist circumference, triglyceride, uric acid, creatinine, visceral fat area and lower HDL-C. In multivariate analyses, bilirubin concentration significantly correlated with diastolic blood pressure, creatinine, and visceral fat area. However, there was no association between bilirubin concentration and subcutaneous fat area. In the animal study, DIO mice treated with biliverdin had smaller adipocytes than untreated DIO mice and biliverdin improved HFD-induced insulin resistance. Biliverdin treatment reversed the higher gene expression of Cd11c, encoding an M1 macrophage marker, and Tnfa, encoding the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α, in the adipose tissues of DIO mice. These data suggest biliverdin administration alleviates insulin resistance by ameliorating inflammation and the dysregulation of adipocytokine expression in adipose tissues of DIO mice. Conclusions Bilirubin may protect against insulin resistance by ameliorating visceral obesity and adipose tissue inflammation."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the dual career phenomenon through the international student-athletes' views. Student-athletes competing at the 2017 Summer Universiade were recruited to respond a 31-item online survey encompassing demographic characteristics (Q1-8), sport and university engagement (Q9-13), student-athletes' knowledge and possible sources of information regarding dual career (Q14-22); and dual career support at personal, sport, and academic levels (Q23-31). Four hundred twenty-six respondents (males: 46%, females 54%), competing in 22 different sports (individual: 74%, team: 26%) from Africa (4%), America (20%), Asia (34%), Europe (39%), and Oceania (3), had experienced previous international sports events (94%). Differences among continents emerged for sport (p<0.001) and university (p = 0.039) engagement, and transfer time from home to the training venue (p = 0.030). Individual sports student-athletes showed higher sport engagement (p = 0.003) compared to team sports counterparts. Differences among university majors emerged for university engagement (p<0.001). Long absence from classes (57%), limited leisure time (50%), financial uncertainty (44%), reduction of training due to education (42%), and overload feelings (37%) emerged. The majority of the sample resulted not familiar with dual career programmes (60%) and public authorities (69%), envisaging national dual career policies at university (37%) and sport (25%) levels. Multiple relevant dual career supporters at personal, sport, and university levels were identified, mainly parents (86%) and coaches (65%). To strengthen the potential of the student-athletes of the future, a dual career network should be established among several stakeholders, for transnational cooperation and sharing of knowledge and best practices through extensive communication between policy-makers, practitioners and those having a strong supportive dual career role (e.g., parents, coaches, and university sport staff)."
https://openalex.org/W2977560903,"Background Prophages play a significant role in prokaryotic evolution, often altering the function of the cell that they infect via transfer of new genes e.g., virulence or antibiotic resistance factors, inactivation of existing genes or by modifying gene expression. Recently, phage therapy has gathered renewed interest as a promising alternative to control bacterial infections. Cataloging the repertoire of prophages in large collections of species’ genomes is an important initial step in understanding their evolution and potential therapeutic utility. However, current widely-used tools for identifying prophages within bacterial genome sequences are mainly web-based, can have long response times, and do not scale to keep pace with the many thousands of genomes currently being sequenced routinely. Methodology In this work, we present ProphET, an easy to install prophage predictor to be used in Linux operation system, without the constraints associated with a web-based tool. ProphET predictions rely on similarity searches against a database of prophage genes, taking as input a bacterial genome sequence in FASTA format and its corresponding gene annotation in GFF. ProphET identifies prophages in three steps: similarity search, calculation of the density of prophage genes, and edge refinement. ProphET performance was evaluated and compared with other phage predictors based on a set of 54 bacterial genomes containing 267 manually annotated prophages. Findings and conclusions ProphET identifies prophages in bacterial genomes with high precision and offers a fast, highly scalable alternative to widely-used web-based applications for prophage detection."
https://openalex.org/W2977651776,"Microliths-small, retouched, often-backed stone tools-are often interpreted to be the product of composite tools, including projectile weapons, and efficient hunting strategies by modern humans. In Europe and Africa these lithic toolkits are linked to hunting of medium- and large-sized game found in grassland or woodland settings, or as adaptations to risky environments during periods of climatic change. Here, we report on a recently excavated lithic assemblage from the Late Pleistocene cave site of Fa-Hien Lena in the tropical evergreen rainforest of Sri Lanka. Our analyses demonstrate that Fa-Hien Lena represents the earliest microlith assemblage in South Asia (c. 48,000-45,000 cal. years BP) in firm association with evidence for the procurement of small to medium size arboreal prey and rainforest plants. Moreover, our data highlight that the lithic technology of Fa-Hien Lena changed little over the long span of human occupation (c. 48,000-45,000 cal. years BP to c. 4,000 cal. years BP) indicating a successful, stable technological adaptation to the tropics. We argue that microlith assemblages were an important part of the environmental plasticity that enabled Homo sapiens to colonise and specialise in a diversity of ecological settings during its expansion within and beyond Africa. The proliferation of diverse microlithic technologies across Eurasia c. 48-45 ka was part of a flexible human 'toolkit' that assisted our species' spread into all of the world's environments, and the development of specialised technological and cultural approaches to novel ecological situations."

ROS production by KOR-inactivating antagonists norbinaltorphimine (norBNI) and JDTic blocks Gαi protein activation, but the signaling mechanisms and consequences of JNK activation by KOR agonists remain uncharacterized. Binding of arrestins to KOR causes desensitization of G protein signaling and acts as a scaffold to initiate MAPK activation. Here, we found that the KOR agonists U50,488 and dynorphin B stimulated biphasic JNK activation with an early arrestin-independent phase, requiring the small G protein RAC family small GTPase 1 (RAC1) and protein kinase C (PKC), and a later arrestin-scaffolded phase, requiring RAC1 and Ras homolog family member (RHO) kinase. JNK activation by U50,488 and dynorphin B also stimulated PRDX6-dependent ROS production but with an inverted U-shaped dose-response relationship. KOR agonist-induced ROS generation resulted from the early arrestin-independent phase of JNK activation, and this ROS response was suppressed by arrestin-dependent activation of the MAPK p38. The apparent balance between p38 MAPK and JNK/ROS signaling has important physiological implications for understanding of dynorphin activities during the stress response. To visualize these activities, we monitored KOR agonist–mediated activation of ROS in transfected live cells by two fluorescent sensors, CellROX Green and HyPerRed. These findings establish an important aspect of opioid receptor signaling and suggest that ROS induction may be part of the physiological response to KOR activation.

Activation of phospho-JNK by norBNI stimulates peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), which in turn stimulates NADPH oxidase to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Local production of ROS oxidizes the cysteine sulfhydryl of Gαi required for reversible palmitoylation. The depalmitoylated Gαi binds tightly to KOR but in a conformation that prevents nucleotide exchange by the KOR signaling complex (29Schattauer S.S. Land B.B. Reichard K.L. Abraham A.D. Burgeno L.M. Kuhar J.R. Phillips P.E.M. Ong S.E. Chavkin C. Peroxiredoxin 6 mediates Gαi protein-coupled receptor inactivation by cJun kinase.Nat.

The tightly bound, depalmitoylated KOR–Gαi complex is permanently inactivated, and recovery presumably requires new receptor synthesis to restore KOR function. Thus, these receptor-inactivating KOR antagonists are actually functional (JNK-biased) agonists that have long durations of effect through a JNK-dependent mechanism rather than through slow drug dissociation (27Bruchas M.R.

To address these questions, we have focused on how KOR activation by conventional agonists stimulates JNK signaling. KOR agonists were found to increase phospho-JNK by both arrestin-independent and arrestin-dependent mechanisms. JNK activation by KOR agonists stimulated the production of ROS that could be detected by the fluorescent sensors CellROX Green and HyPerRed in transfected HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells stably transfected with KOR respond to the selective agonist U50,488 (10 μm) with a biphasic increase in phospho-JNK (Fig. 1, B and C). Phospho-JNK immunoreactivity (IR) was significantly increased in an early phase at 15 min (170 ± 21% of basal, p < 0.05) and significantly increased in a late phase with a peak at 60 min (160 ± 21% of basal, p < 0.05). To confirm that the increase in JNK phosphorylation was mediated through KOR activation of Gαi, cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin (PTX; 10 ng/ml) 3 h prior to treatment with 10 μm U50,488 for 15 or 60 min, and cell lysates were immunoblotted for phospho-JNK IR (Fig. 1, D and E). PTX significantly inhibited U50,488-induced phospho-JNK IR compared with vehicle pretreatment at both 15 min (104 ± 4 and 138 ± 12%, respectively; p < 0.05) and 60 min (81 ± 12 and 126 ± 7%, respectively; p < 0.01). To further confirm agonist-induced JNK activity, we looked at U50,488-mediated phosphorylation of the JNK substrate c-Jun (Fig. 1, F and G). U50,488 treatment resulted in a monophasic increase in phospho-c-Jun IR with a significant increase at 60 min (172 ± 18% of basal, p < 0.01). We next sought to replicate these findings with dynorphin B, an endogenous peptide ligand for KOR (34Suda M. Nakao K. Yoshimasa T. Ikeda Y. Sakamoto M. Yanaihara C. Yanaihara N. Numa S. Imura H. Comparison of the action of putative endogenous κ-agonists, leumorphin and rimorphin in vitro.Life Sci. 1983; 33 Suppl. 1 (6319876): 275-27810.1016/0024-3205(83)90496-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 35Bian J.S.

Exp. Ther. 2000; 292 (10688624): 1065-1070PubMed Google Scholar). KOR-expressing HEK293 cells were treated for 5–60 min with 1 μm dynorphin B, and cell lysates were then immunoblotted for phospho-JNK (Fig. 1, H and I). Similar to U50,488, dynorphin B stimulated a biphasic increase in phospho-JNK IR with significantly increased phospho-JNK IR at 30 min (136 ± 6% of basal, p < 0.01) and 120 min (133 ± 12% of basal, p < 0.05), indicating that JNK activation by dynorphin is qualitatively similar to U50,488 but with slightly delayed kinetics. The reason for the slower kinetics of JNK phosphorylation following dynorphin is unclear as no difference in kinetics is observed in dynorphin-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 1, J and K). To assess the role of arrestin, we transfected KOR-expressing HEK293 cells with siRNA against arrestin 2, arrestin 3, or scrambled control siRNA prior to treatment with 10 μm U50,488 for 15 or 60 min. Selective knockdown of arrestin 2 or arrestin 3 was confirmed by immunoblotting for each isoform (Fig. 2, A and B). Arrestin 2 IR was selectively reduced by siRNA against arrestin 2 (48 ± 2% of control, p < 0.01) but not by siRNA against arrestin 3 (98 ± 16% of control). Arrestin 3 IR was significantly reduced by siRNA against arrestin 3 (38 ± 6% of basal, p < 0.001) but not by siRNA against arrestin 2 (89 ± 10% of basal). Knockdown of arrestin 2 or 3 had no effect on the early phase (15 min) of U50,488-stimulated phospho-JNK IR compared with control siRNA transfection (135 ± 12, 133 ± 8, and 139 ± 8% of basal, respectively) (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, knockdown of arrestin 3, but not arrestin 2, significantly inhibited the late phase (60 min) of U50,488-stimulated phospho-JNK IR at (102 ± 12% of basal, p < 0.05, and 143 ± 7% of basal, respectively) compared with control siRNA transfection (133 ± 5% of basal). These data suggest that the early-phase JNK activation by U50,488 is arrestin-independent, whereas later-phase activation at 60 min depends on arrestin 3 expression. We next sought to characterize the mechanisms underlying KOR-mediated JNK activation. A role for the small G protein RAC, but not RHO, in KOR-stimulated JNK phosphorylation has been described previously (32Kam A.Y. Chan A.S. Wong Y.H.

https://openalex.org/W2979106448,"Background Low quality and frequency of antenatal care (ANC) are associated with lower uptake of facility-based deliveries—a key intervention to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality. We implemented group ANC (G-ANC), an alternative service delivery model, in Kenya and Nigeria, to assess its impact on quality and attendance at ANC and uptake of facility-based delivery. Methods From October 2016‒January 2018, we conducted a facility-based, pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial with 20 clusters per country. We recruited women <24 weeks gestation during their first ANC visit and enrolled women at intervention facilities who agreed to attend G-ANC in lieu of routine individual ANC. The G-ANC model consisted of five monthly 2-hour meetings with clinical assessments alongside structured gestationally specific group discussions and activities. Quality of care was defined as receipt of eight specific ANC interventions. Data were obtained through facility records and self-report during a home-based postpartum survey. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings All women who completed follow up are included in the analysis (Nigeria: 1018/1075 enrolled women [94.7%], Kenya: 826/1013 [81.5%]). In Nigeria women in the intervention arm were more likely to have a facility-based delivery compared to those in the control arm (Nigeria: 76.7% [391/510] versus 54.1% [275/508]; aOR 2.30, CI 1.51–3.49). In both countries women in the intervention arm were more likely than those in the control arm to receive quality ANC (Nigeria: aOR 5.8, CI 1.98–17.21, p<0.001; Kenya: aOR 5.08, CI 2.31–11.16, p<0.001) and to attend at least four ANC visits (Nigeria: aOR 13.30, CI 7.69–22.99, p<0.001; Kenya: aOR 7.12, CI 3.91–12.97, p<0.001). Conclusions G-ANC was associated with higher facility-based delivery rates in Nigeria, where those rates associated with individual ANC were low. In both Kenya and Nigeria it was associated with a higher proportion of women receiving quality ANC and higher frequency of ANC visits."
https://openalex.org/W2978044204,"The role of the telomere repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2) in telomere maintenance is well-established. However, recent findings suggest that TRF2 also functions outside telomeres, but relatively little is known about this function. Herein, using genome-wide ChIP-Seq assays of TRF2-bound chromatin from HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, we identified thousands of TRF2-binding sites within the extra-telomeric genome. In light of this observation, we asked how TRF2 occupancy is organized within the genome. Interestingly, we found that extra-telomeric TRF2 sites throughout the genome are enriched in potential G-quadruplex-forming DNA sequences. Furthermore, we validated TRF2 occupancy at several promoter G-quadruplex motifs, which did adopt quadruplex forms in solution. TRF2 binding altered expression and the epigenetic state of several target promoters, indicated by histone modifications resulting in transcriptional repression of eight of nine genes investigated here. Furthermore, TRF2 occupancy and target gene expression were also sensitive to the well-known intracellular G-quadruplex-binding ligand 360A. Together, these results reveal an extensive genome-wide association of TRF2 outside telomeres and that it regulates gene expression in a G-quadruplex-dependent fashion."

Expression of LINC00284 in OC tissues and cells was determined. Next, the interaction between LINC00284 and mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST) was evaluated. Subsequently, OC cells were transfected with overexpressed (oe)-LINC00284, silenced (si)-LINC00284, si-NF-κB1, oe-MEST, or si-MEST plasmids to investigate the underlying mechanism of LINC00284 in OC. Afterwards, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated protein x (Bax), VEGF, and CD31 was determined to assess the effect of LINC00284 on OC cell proliferation, invasion, migration angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Finally, the effect of LINC00284 on tumorigenesis was investigated in nude mice models of OC. LINC00284 was highly expressed in OC. si-LINC00284 increased expression of MEST. si-LINC00284 or si-NF-κB1 led to the reduction in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, tube formation, angiogenesis, and tumorigenic ability and promoted apoptosis in OC by down-regulating MMP-2, MMP-9, Bcl-2, VEGF, and CD31 and up-regulating Bax. These effects were all reversed following the si-MEST. In vivo experiments found the same results, confirming the aforementioned findings.

https://openalex.org/W2977265152,"Background RNA sequencing has been proposed as a means of increasing diagnostic rates in studies of undiagnosed rare inherited disease. Recent studies have reported diagnostic improvements in the range of 7.5–35% by profiling splicing, gene expression quantification and allele specific expression. To-date however, no study has systematically assessed the presence of gene-fusion transcripts in cases of germline disease. Fusion transcripts are routinely identified in cancer studies and are increasingly recognized as having diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic relevance. Isolated reports exist of fusion transcripts being detected in cases of developmental and neurological phenotypes, and thus, systematic application of fusion detection to germline conditions may further increase diagnostic rates. However, current fusion detection methods are unsuited to the investigation of germline disease due to performance biases arising from their development using tumor, cell-line or in-silico data. Methods We describe a tailored approach to fusion candidate identification and prioritization in a cohort of 47 undiagnosed, suspected inherited disease patients. We modify an existing fusion transcript detection algorithm by eliminating its cell line-derived filtering steps, and instead, prioritize candidates using a custom workflow that integrates genomic and transcriptomic sequence alignment, biological and technical annotations, customized categorization logic, and phenotypic prioritization. Results We demonstrate that our approach to fusion transcript identification and prioritization detects genuine fusion events excluded by standard analyses and efficiently removes phenotypically unimportant candidates and false positive events, resulting in a reduced candidate list enriched for events with potential phenotypic relevance. We describe the successful genetic resolution of two previously undiagnosed disease cases through the detection of pathogenic fusion transcripts. Furthermore, we report the experimental validation of five additional cases of fusion transcripts with potential phenotypic relevance. Conclusions The approach we describe can be implemented to enable the detection of phenotypically relevant fusion transcripts in studies of rare inherited disease. Fusion transcript detection has the potential to increase diagnostic rates in rare inherited disease and should be included in RNA-based analytical pipelines aimed at genetic diagnosis."

We characterized microbial communities in vaginal swabs collected between 16–20 gestational weeks in the Zambian Preterm Birth Prevention Study to investigate whether HIV and its treatment alter the microbiome in pregnancy. We quantified relative abundance and diversity of bacterial taxa by whole-genome shotgun sequencing and identified community state types (CST) by hierarchical clustering. Associations between exposures—HIV serostatus (HIV+ vs HIV-) and preconceptional ART (ART+ vs ART-)—and microbiome characteristics were tested with rank-sum, and by linear and logistic regression, accounting for sampling by inverse-probability weighting. Of 261 vaginal swabs, 256 (98%) had evaluable sequences; 98 (38%) were from HIV+ participants, 55 (56%) of whom had preconceptional ART exposure. Major CSTs were dominated by: L. crispatus (CST 1; 17%), L.] iners (CST 3; 32%), Gardnerella vaginalis (CST 4-I; 37%), G. vaginalis & Atopobium vaginae (CST 4-II; 5%), and other mixed anaerobes (CST 4-III; 9%). G. vaginalis was present in 95%; mean relative abundance was higher in HIV+ (0.46±0.29) compared to HIV- participants (0.35±0.33; rank-sum p = .01). Shannon diversity was higher in HIV+/ART+ (coeff 0.17; 95%CI (0.01,0.33), p = .04) and HIV+/ART- (coeff 0.37; 95%CI (0.19,0.55), p < .001) participants compared to HIV-.

Restricting the comparison to 111 women in either CST 3 (L. iners dominance) or CST 1 (L. crispatus dominance), CST 3 frequency was similar in HIV- (63%) and HIV+/ART- participants (67%, AOR 1.31; 95%CI: (0.25,6.90), p = .7), but higher in HIV+/ART+ (89%, AOR 6.44; 95%CI: (1.12,37.0), p = .04).

Information about labour/delivery and newborn management/care were recorded on data collection forms. Causes of deaths were predominantly based on clinical diagnosis.671 were admitted to a neonatal area. Reasons included prematurity n = 213 (32%), respiratory issues n = 209 (31%), meconium stained amniotic fluid with respiratory issues n = 115 (17%) and observation for < 24 hours n = 97 (14%). Death occurred in 124 infants. Presumed causes were birth asphyxia (BA) n = 59 (48%), prematurity n = 19 (15%), presumed sepsis n = 19 (15%), meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) n = 13 (10%) and congenital abnormalities n = 14 (11%). More newborns who died versus survivors had oxygen saturation <60% on admission (37/113 vs 32/258; p≤0.001) respectively. Moderate hypothermia on admission was common i.e. deaths 35.1 (34.6-36.0) vs survivors 35.5 (35.0-36.0)°C (p≤0.001). Term newborns who died versus survivors were fourfold more likely to have received positive pressure ventilation after birth i.e. 4.57 (1.22-17.03) (p<0.02).Intrapartum-related complications (BA, MAS), prematurity, and presumed sepsis were the leading causes of death. Intrapartum hypoxia, prematurity and attendant complications and presumed sepsis, are major pathways leading to death. Severe hypoxia and hypothermia upon admission are additional contributing factors. Strategies to identify fetuses at risk during labour e.g. improved fetal heart rate monitoring, coupled with timely interventions, and implementation of WHO interventions for preterm newborns, may reduce mortality in this low resource setting."
https://openalex.org/W2978213497,"Vector-borne pathogens are a significant public health concern worldwide. Infections with these pathogens, some of which are emerging, are likely under-recognized due to the lack of widely-available laboratory tests. There is an urgent need for further advancement in diagnostic modalities to detect new and known vector-borne pathogens. We evaluated the utility of metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MGS) as a pathogen agnostic approach for detecting vector-borne pathogens from human blood samples.Residual whole blood samples from patients with known infection with Babesia microti, Borrelia hermsii, Plasmodium falciparum, Mansonella perstans, Anaplasma phagocytophilum or Ehrlichia chaffeensis were studied. Samples underwent DNA extraction, removal of human DNA, whole genome amplification, and paired-end library preparation, followed by sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2500.

The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has 19 GH3 proteins, of which 8 have confirmed biochemical functions. One Brassicaceae-specific clade of GH3 proteins was predicted to use benzoate as a substrate and includes AtGH3.7 and AtGH3.12/PBS3. Previously identified as a 4-hydroxybenzoic acid-glutamate synthetase, AtGH3.12/PBS3 influences pathogen defense responses through salicylic acid. Recent work has shown that AtGH3.12/PBS3 uses isochorismate as a substrate, forming an isochorismate-glutamate conjugate that converts into salicylic acid. Here, we show that AtGH3.7 and AtGH3.12/PBS3 can also conjugate chorismate to cysteine and glutamate, which act as precursors to aromatic amino acids and salicylic acid, respectively. The X-ray crystal structure of AtGH3.12/PBS3 in complex with AMP and chorismate at 1.94 Å resolution, along with site-directed mutagenesis, revealed how the active site potentially accommodates this substrate. Examination of Arabidopsis knockout lines indicated that the gh3.7 mutants do not alter growth and showed no increased susceptibility to the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, unlike gh3.12 mutants, which were more susceptible than WT plants, as was the gh3.7/gh3.12 double mutant.

Another clade of GH3 proteins with a characterized homologue is Brassicaceae-specific and has two members in Arabidopsis: AtGH3.7 and AtGH3.12/PBS3, which share 75% amino acid sequence identity (10Westfall C.S.

AtGH3.12/PBS3 was originally identified in a mutant screen for increased susceptibility to both avirulent and virulent Pseudomonas syringae strains and was named pbs3-1 (avrPphB susceptible 3) (14Warren R.F.

Interestingly, treatment of pbs3-1 plants with exogenous SA leads to normal induction of pathogen responsive transcripts and SA-glucosides after infection and the SA-treated pbs3-1 plants are as resistant to P. syringae infection as WT plants (17Nobuta K.

From these studies, it was proposed that AtGH3.12/PBS3 functions upstream of SA, potentially in its biosynthesis. Recent work identified a plastidial membrane transporter and AtGH3.12/PBS3 as required proteins in SA production (24Rekhter D. Lüdke D. Ding Y. Feussner K. Zienkiewicz K. Lipka V. Wiermer M. Zhang Y. Feussner I. Isochorismate-derived biosynthesis of the plant stress hormone salicylic acid.Science. 2019; 365 (31371615): 498-50210.1126/science.aaw1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In that study (24Rekhter D. Lüdke D. Ding Y. Feussner K. Zienkiewicz K. Lipka V. Wiermer M. Zhang Y. Feussner I.

This work also identified chorismate-glutamate as a secondary product of the enzyme (24Rekhter D. Lüdke D. Ding Y. Feussner K. Zienkiewicz K. Lipka V. Wiermer M. Zhang Y. Feussner I. Isochorismate-derived biosynthesis of the plant stress hormone salicylic acid.Science. 2019; 365 (31371615): 498-50210.1126/science.aaw1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To date, AtGH3.7, the other member of this clade, has escaped in vivo and biochemical characterization. SA can be synthesized by two routes in plants, both of which use the aromatic amino acid branch point metabolite, chorismate, as a precursor (25Vlot A.C. Dempsey D.A. Klessig D.F. Salicylic acid, a multifaceted hormone to combat disease.Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2009; 47 (19400653): 177-20610.1146/annurev.phyto.050908.135202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). In one pathway, the chorismate-derived aromatic amino acid phenylalanine is converted into SA through benzoate intermediates or coumaric acid (26Mauch-Mani B. Slusarenko A.J. Production of salicylic acid precursors is a major function of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in the resistance of Arabidopsis to Peronospora parasitica.Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 203-21210.2307/3870265Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The second pathway converts chorismate into SA using isochorismate synthase and AtGH3.12/PBS3 (18Wildermuth M.C. Dewdney J. Wu G. Ausubel F.M. Isochorismate synthase is required to synthesize salicylic acid for plant defence.Nature. 2001; 414 (11734859): 562-57510.1038/35107108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 27Serino L.

Genet. 1995; 249: 217-22810.1007/BF00290369Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). There are two isochorismate synthase genes in Arabidopsis, but the ics1/ics2 double mutant line still produces SA, suggesting that this pathway is not the only source of SA in this model plant (20Garcion C. Lohmann A. Lamodière E. Catinot J. Buchala A. Doermann P. Métreaux J.-P. Characterization and biological function of the ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 2 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Physiol. 2008; 147 (18451262): 1279-128710.1104/pp.108.119420Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). AtGH3.12/PBS3 forms isochorismate-glutamate, which then degrades into SA (24Rekhter D. Lüdke D. Ding Y. Feussner K. Zienkiewicz K. Lipka V. Wiermer M. Zhang Y. Feussner I. Isochorismate-derived biosynthesis of the plant stress hormone salicylic acid.Science. 2019; 365 (31371615): 498-50210.1126/science.aaw1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar); however, homologs of AtGH3.12/PBS3 and AtGH3.7 are only found in the Brassicaceae (10Westfall C.S. Zubieta C. Herrmann J. Kapp U. Nanao M.H. Jez J.M. Structural basis for prereceptor modulation of plant hormones by GH3 proteins.Science. 2012; 336 (22628555): 1708-171110.1126/science.1221863Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which raises a question of how widespread this new biosynthetic pathway actually is in the plant kingdom. Here, we re-examined the possible biochemical function of the Brassicaceae-specific clade proteins AtGH3.12/PBS3 and AtGH3.7 and, in the absence of commercially available isochorismate, identified each protein as chorismate-conjugating enzymes. Using a combination of steady-state kinetics, X-ray crystallography, and site-directed mutagenesis, the molecular basis of chorismate binding in AtGH3.12/PBS3 was revealed, which also provides insight on the isochorismate-conjugating activity of this protein. The in vivo role of AtGH3.7 was analyzed through P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 infection assays, and a double mutant gh3.7/gh3.12 Arabidopsis line was generated to determine the combined role of this unique class of GH3 proteins in the Brassicaceae family. Because of the relaxed substrate specificity that is typical of GH3 proteins, it is not surprising that AtGH3.12/PBS3 can recognize both chorismate and isochorismate as substrates (11Westfall C.S.

https://openalex.org/W2979067422,"Despite substantial research on the economic effects of transgenic insect-resistant Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton, there is still limited work on this technology’s impacts on human health. Due to the inbuilt insect resistance, Bt cotton requires fewer pesticide sprays than conventional cotton, which is not only advantageous from economic and environmental perspectives, but may also result in health benefits for farmers. Using socioeconomic and biophysical data from Pakistan, we provide the first evidence of a direct association between Bt gene expression in the plant and health benefits. A key feature of this study is that Bt cotton cultivation in Pakistan occurs in a poorly regulated market: farmers are often mistaken in their beliefs about whether they have planted Bt cotton or conventional cotton, which may affect their pesticide-use strategies and thus their pesticide exposure. We employ a cost-of-illness approach and variations in the measurement of Bt adoption to estimate the relationship between Bt cotton and farmers’ health. Bt adoption based on farmers’ beliefs does not reduce the pesticide-induced cost of illness. However, adoption based on measuring Bt gene expression is associated with significant health cost savings. Extrapolating the estimates for true Bt seeds to Pakistan’s entire Bt cotton area results in annual health cost savings of around US$ 7 million. These findings have important implications for the regulation of seed markets in Pakistan and beyond: improved regulations that ensure claimed crop traits are really expressed can increase the benefits for farmers and society at large."

We included patients with a MV duration ≥10 days, with or without tracheostomy. We explored the one-year mortality with a classical Cox regression model (adjustment on age, SAPS II, baseline diagnosis and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies) and a Cox regression model using tracheostomy as a time-dependant variable.29.5% patients underwent prolonged MV, out of which 25.6% received tracheostomy and 74.4% did not. At one-year, 45.2% patients had died in the tracheostomy group and 51.5% patients had died in the group without tracheostomy (p = 0.001). In the Cox-adjusted regression model, tracheostomy was not associated with improved one-year outcome (HR CI95 0.7 [0.5-1.001], p = 0.051), as well as in the model using tracheostomy as a time-dependent variable (OR CI 95 1 [0.7-1.4], p = 0.9).In our study, there was no statistically significant difference in the one-year mortality of patients undergoing prolonged MV when receiving tracheostomy or not.NCT01367093."
https://openalex.org/W2978270920,"Cancers of the head and neck have a high mortality rate, and roughly 10% of the patients die within six months of diagnosis. To our knowledge little has been written about this group. We wished to identify risk factors for early death, to predict and monitor patients at risk better and, if possible, avoid unjustified major treatment.This population-based nationwide study from the Swedish Head and Neck Cancer Register (SweHNCR) included data from 2008-2015 and 9733 patients at potential risk of early death. A total of 925 (9.5%) patients died within six months. For every year older the patients became, the risk of early death increased by 2.3% (p<0.001). The relative risk of death was 3.37 times higher (237%) for patients with WHO score 1 compared with WHO score 0. A primary tumour in the hypopharynx correlated with a 24% increased risk over the oral cavity (p<0.024). Patients with stage IV disease had a 3.7 times greater risk of early death than those with stage I (p<0.001). As expected, a 12 times increased risk of early death was noted in the palliative treatment group, compared to the curative group. Limitations to this study were that the actual cause of death was not recorded in the SweHNCR, and that socioeconomic factors, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, and HPV status, were not reported in SweHNCR until 2015. However, the fact that this is a population-based nationwide study including 9733 patients compensates for some of these limitations.Identification of patients at increased risk of early death shows that older patients with advanced disease, increased WHO score, primary tumour in the hypopharynx, and those given palliative treatment, are more likely than the others to die from head and neck cancer within six months of diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2978338290,"Pulmonary immunosuppression often occurs after burn injury (BI). However, the reasons for BI‐induced pulmonary immunosuppression are not clearly understood. Neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation (NETosis) are important components of a robust pulmonary immune response, and we hypothesized that pulmonary inflammation and NETosis are defective after BI. To test this hypothesis, we established a mouse model with intranasal LPS instillation in the presence or absence of BI (15% of body surface burn) and determined the degree of immune cell infiltration, NETosis, and the cytokine levels in the airways and blood on d 2. Presence of LPS recruited monocytes and large numbers of neutrophils to the airways and induced NETosis (citrullinated histone H3, DNA, myeloperoxidase). By contrast, BI significantly reduced LPS‐mediated leukocyte recruitment and NETosis. This BI‐induced immunosuppression is attributable to the reduction of chemokine (C‐C motif) ligand (CCL) 2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) and CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1a). BI also suppressed LPS‐induced increase in IL‐17A, IL‐17C, and IL‐17E/IL‐25 levels in the airways. Therefore, BI‐mediated reduction in leukocyte recruitment and NETosis in the lungs are attributable to these cytokines. Regulating the levels of some of these key cytokines represents a potential therapeutic option for mitigating BI‐mediated pulmonary immunosuppression.—Sakuma, M., Khan, M. A.

Thus, this study investigated the effect of EBF cessation time on childhood morbidity and adverse nutritional outcome in Ethiopia. Methods We used the 2011 and 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys. The study involved 2,433 children under six months of age. Logistic regression model was applied to determine the effect of EBF cessation time on outcome variables. Population Attributable Fraction was calculated to evaluate the public health impacts of EBF termination in the population. Results Discontinuing EBF at 0–3 months (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 3.53)) and 4–6 months (AOR: 3.57, 95% CI: 2.19, 5.83) increased diarrhea occurrence compared to children who continued EBF up to 6 months. Children who had terminated EBF at 4–6 months had increased odds of fever (AOR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.68) and acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) (AOR: 2.74, 95% CI: 1.61, 4.65). Cessation of EBF earlier than 4 months or between 4–6 months was associated with increased odds of having at least one childhood morbidity. Termination of EBF at 0–3 months and at 4–6 months were associated with increased occurrence of wasting (AOR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.45, 3.74) and underweight (AOR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.36, 3.91), respectively. Exclusive breastfeeding can avert 42% of diarrhea, 27% of ARI, 21% of fever, 26% of wasting and 23% of underweight burden among children under six months of age. Conclusions Termination of EBF before six months was associated with increased occurrence of diarrhea, fever and ARIs. It was also linked with increased occurrence of childhood wasting and underweight. The finding emphasized EBF for the first six months to reduce childhood morbidity and adverse nutritional outcomes."

Contrary to what has been proposed previously, poliovirus RdRp that was bound to RNA with an incorporated 2′-C-methyl nucleotide could still bind to the next incoming NTP. Our results also indicated that incorporation of the 2′-C-methyl nucleotide does not disrupt RdRp–RNA interactions and does not prevent translocation. Instead, incorporation of the 2′-C-methyl nucleotide blocked closure of the RdRp active site upon binding of the next correct incoming NTP, which prevented further nucleotide addition.

RNA-dependent RNA polymerase hepatitis C virus poliovirus 2′-C-methyladenosine heteronuclear single quantum coherence. The RdRp three-dimensional structure has been described as a cupped right hand with fingers, thumb, and palm subdomains, similar to the overall architecture of other single-subunit nucleic acid polymerases (17Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of poliovirus.Structure. 1997; 5 (9309225): 1109-112210.1016/S0969-2126(97)00261-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Viral RdRps are unique compared with other nucleic acid polymerases in that there are extensive interactions between the fingers and thumb subdomains, providing completely encircled active sites (18Ferrero D. Ferrer-Orta C. Verdaguer N. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases: a structural overview.Subcell.

The enclosure of the RdRp active site means that mechanisms of nucleotide selection, addition, and translocation may differ from other nucleic acid polymerases. There are available X-ray crystal structures for a number of RdRps, including those for flaviviruses and picornaviruses (18Ferrero D. Ferrer-Orta C. Verdaguer N. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases: a structural overview.Subcell. Biochem. 2018; 88 (29900492): 39-7110.1007/978-981-10-8456-0_3Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the only X-ray crystal structures with RdRp (in this case, from hepatitis C virus (HCV)) in complex with 2′-C-methyl nucleotides represent a step before nucleotide incorporation, with the triphosphorylated 2′-C-methyl nucleotide acting as the next incoming NTP (19Appleby T.C.

Although these structures have revealed molecular determinants important for nucleotide analog recognition, they provide little insight into the mechanism of RNA termination. A series of X-ray crystal structures of poliovirus (PV) and related RdRps provides insights into the steps of nucleotide incorporation and subsequent translocation (20Gong P. Kortus M.G. Nix J.C.

After base-pairing with the template nucleotide, the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyls of the incoming NTP make key hydrogen bonding interactions with Ser-288 and Asn-297 in motif B (PV numbering), triggering structural rearrangements to “close” the active site and prepare for the phosphoryl transfer reaction (21Gong P. Peersen O.B. Structural basis for active site closure by the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Critically, structural motif A is realigned to form a complete three-stranded β-sheet with motif C, which causes motif A residue Asp-233 to swing toward the RNA, allowing it to coordinate the magnesium ions necessary for catalysis (21Gong P. Peersen O.B. Structural basis for active site closure by the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The triphosphate of the incoming NTP is also realigned to promote inline nucleophilic attack from the primer 3′-hydroxyl, aided in part by conserved residues in motifs D and F (21Gong P. Peersen O.B.

The phosphoryl transfer reaction then takes place, according to the two metal ion mechanism shared by other nucleic acid polymerases (24Steitz T.A. DNA-dependent and RNA-dependent DNA-polymerases.Curr. Opin. Struct.

We have also proposed that there is a repositioning of motif D residue Lys-359 so that it can act as a general acid to protonate the pyrophosphate leaving the group (25Castro C. Smidansky E.

Following nucleotide addition, the active site reopens to release the pyrophosphate, but this conformational change is not tightly coupled to translocation as it is in other nucleic acid polymerases (22Shu B. Gong P. Structural basis of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalysis and translocation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

It has been proposed that additional structural changes in motif B then mechanically aid translocation (29Sholders A.J. Peersen O.B. Distinct conformations of a putative translocation element in poliovirus polymerase.J. Mol.

The 2′-C-methyl ribonucleotides may act at any of these steps to terminate RNA synthesis. Initial modeling studies have proposed that the next incoming NTP is prevented from binding because of a steric clash with the 2′-C-methyl group (13Migliaccio G. Tomassini J.E. Carroll S.S. Tomei L. Altamura S. Bhat B. Bartholomew L. Bosserman M.R. Ceccacci A. Colwell L.F. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Eldrup A.B. Getty K.L.

Excision of the incorporated 2′-C-methyl nucleotide through pyrophosphorolysis (i.e. the reverse of the nucleotide addition reaction) was not sensitive to the next NTP, which, the authors suggested, was also evidence that NTP binding was impeded (31Deval J. Powdrill M.H. D'Abramo C.M. Cellai L. Götte M. Pyrophosphorolytic excision of nonobligate chain terminators by hepatitis C virus NS5B polymerase.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51 (17502402): 2920-292810.1128/AAC.00186-07Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Incorporation of the 2′-C-methyl nucleotide might also disrupt interactions between the RdRp and RNA to promote RNA release, diminish the ability of the RdRp to form the catalytically competent closed conformation, and/or inhibit translocation after nucleotide analog incorporation. In the absence of X-ray crystal structure data, we used solution-state NMR studies of PV RdRp, along with steady-state kinetics, to provide insight into the mechanism of RNA chain termination by 2′-C-methyl ribonucleotides. These studies suggest that incorporation of 2′-C-methyl nucleotide prevents subsequent active-site closure, a prerequisite step for incorporation of the next incoming nucleotide. We first tested the ability of PV RdRp to incorporate 2′-C-methyl nucleotide. Here we used 2′-C-methyladenosine (2′-C-Me-A) as a representative member of the 2′-C-methyl nucleotide analogs (Fig. 2), and the ssAU RNA, which contains a 6-bp duplex flanked by four nucleotide 5′ overhangs (i.e. 5′-GCAUGGGCCC-3′) (32Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. Poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D(pol)). Assembly of stable, elongation-competent complexes by using a symmetrical primer-template substrate (sym/sub).J. Biol.

For the ssAU RNA, the next correct incoming nucleotides would be ATP followed by UTP. PV RdRp was able to incorporate 2′-C-Me-AMP, but this resulted in RNA chain termination, preventing the second nucleotide from being incorporated (Fig. 2). Previous kinetics studies had indicated that incorporation of 2′-C-Me-AMP occurs with reduced catalytic efficiency (33Liu X. Musser D.M. Lee C.A. Yang X. Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. Boehr D.D. Nucleobase but not sugar fidelity is maintained in the Sabin I RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.Viruses. 2015; 7 (26516899): 5571-558610.3390/v7102894Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), as evidenced by a decreased second-order rate constant kpol/Kd,app, where kpol is the maximum polymerase rate constant and Kd,app is the apparent dissociation constant for the incoming NTP (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the second-order rate constants for 2′-C-Me-AMP and 2′-dAMP incorporation were very similar, but 2′-C-Me-AMP was more efficiently incorporated than GMP (33Liu X. Musser D.M. Lee C.A. Yang X. Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. Boehr D.D. Nucleobase but not sugar fidelity is maintained in the Sabin I RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.Viruses. 2015; 7 (26516899): 5571-558610.3390/v7102894Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). As shown previously (13Migliaccio G. Tomassini J.E. Carroll S.S. Tomei L. Altamura S. Bhat B. Bartholomew L. Bosserman M.R. Ceccacci A. Colwell L.F. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Eldrup A.B. Getty K.L.

PV RdRp is 52 kDa in size, which has made analysis of backbone NMR spectra challenging. Nonetheless, it is now well-established that larger proteins (>50 kDa) can be studied by solution-state NMR using 13C isotopically labeled methyl groups, in part because of their favorable relaxation properties, which can result in higher signal to noise (34Rosenzweig R. Kay L.E. Bringing dynamic molecular machines into focus by methyl-TROSY NMR.Annu. Rev.

At both time-points, symptoms associated with concussion were assessed using the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT-3).Concussed patients had significantly weaker hfc in the following six regions 1-month post-concussion compared to HC: middle cingulate, posterior insula, middle occipital, spinal trigeminal nucleus, precentral and the pulvinar. There were no regions of significantly stronger hfc in concussed patients relative to HC. Longitudinally, patients showed significant symptom recovery 5-months post-concussion and had significant strengthening of hfc patterns in seven homotopic ROIs: middle cingulate, posterior insula, middle occipital, secondary somatosensory area, spinal trigeminal nucleus, precentral, and the pulvinar. Post-hoc analyses indicated a significant negative correlation between somatosensory functional connectivity strengthening and symptom severity.At 1-month post-concussion, patients had significantly weaker hfc in a number of pain-processing regions relative to HC. However, over a period of 5-months, region-pair connectivity showed significant recovery and normalization. Those patients with more successful symptom recovery at 5-months post-concussion had more functional somatosensory strengthening, suggesting an association between functional strengthening and post-concussion symptom recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2978827655,"Recently, changes in urinary albumin and in GFR have been recognized as risk factors for the development of end-stage kidney disease and mortality. Though most clinical epidemiology studies of chronic kidney disease (CKD) used renal function and proteinuria at baseline alone, definitive diagnosis of CKD with multiple measurements intensifies the differences in the risk for mortality between the CKD and non-CKD populations. We hypothesized that a transient diagnosis of proteinuria and reduced renal function each indicate a significantly higher mortality compared to definitive non-CKD as the negative control and lower mortality compared with definitive CKD as the positive control. The present longitudinal study evaluated a general-population cohort of 338,094 persons who received annual health checkups, with a median 4.3-year study period. There were 2,481 deaths, including 510 CVD deaths (20.6%) and 1,328 cancer deaths (53.5%), and mortality risk was evaluated for transient proteinuria and for transiently reduced renal function. The hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality and cancer mortality were not significant, but that for cardiovascular mortality was significantly higher for transient proteinuria (HR, 1.94 [95% confidence interval, 1.27–2.96] in men and 2.78 [1.50–5.16] in women). On the other hand, transiently reduced renal function was not significant for either cardiovascular mortality risk or cancer mortality risk. We surmise that this is the first study of the mortality risk of transient dipstick proteinuria in a large general-population cohort with cause-specific death registration. Transiently positive proteinuria appears to be a significant risk specifically for cardiovascular mortality compared with definitely negative for proteinuria."
https://openalex.org/W4231877095,"Developing effective therapies for back pain associated with intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is a research priority since it is a major socioeconomic burden and current conservative and surgical treatments have limited success. Polyphenols are naturally occurring compounds in plant-derived foods and beverages, and evidence suggests dietary supplementation with select polyphenol preparations can modulate diverse neurological and painful disorders. This study tested whether supplementation with a select standardized Bioactive-Dietary-Polyphenol-Preparation (BDPP) may alleviate pain symptoms associated with IVD degeneration. Painful IVD degeneration was surgically induced in skeletally-mature rats by intradiscal saline injection into three consecutive lumbar IVDs. Injured rats were given normal or BDPP-supplemented drinking water. In-vivo hindpaw mechanical allodynia and IVD height were assessed weekly for 6 weeks following injury. Spinal column, dorsal-root-ganglion (DRG) and serum were collected at 1 and 6 weeks post-operative (post-op) for analyses of IVD-related mechanical and biological pathogenic processes. Dietary BDPP significantly alleviated the typical behavioral sensitivity associated with surgical procedures and IVD degeneration, but did not modulate IVD degeneration nor changes of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in IVD. Gene expression analyses suggested BDPP might have an immunomodulatory effect in attenuating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in DRGs. This study supports the idea that dietary supplementation with BDPP has potential to alleviate IVD degeneration-related pain, and further investigations are warranted to identify the mechanisms of action of dietary BDPP."
https://openalex.org/W2977755673,"The quandong or native peach (Santalum acuminatum R.Br.) has been recognised as an important and tasty food resource among Aboriginal Australians in arid and semi-arid areas of southern Australia. It is valued for its fruit that is consumed raw or dried, and for its kernel, which is eaten raw or ground into paste for medicinal and skin care purposes. This paper reports on a study of ground stone implements within the Murray Darling Basin that has identified quandong stones as a distinct type of implement made specifically for the efficient cracking of quandong nuts. Data are presented on 1,327 ground stone implements from collections in 12 different locations in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), an area almost completely devoid of stone sources. Given the paucity of stone, multi-purpose use of implements is widely documented. Although it was common to find pits present in mortars and other ground stone tools demonstrating multiple functions, including use as anvils, a class of single purpose stones with multiple pits and distinctive form was identified. Most of these were found in areas known for groves of quandong and four were analysed for use-wear and residues along with two other ground stone items from the MDB. The results support their identification as specialised anvil stones for cracking quandong nuts."

NT1 has been associated with Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQB1*06:02 but full high-resolution HLA-typing of all loci in vaccine-induced NT1 remains to be done. Therefore, here we performed HLA typing by sequencing HLA-DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, DRB1, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1 and DPB1 in 31 vaccine-associated NT1 patients and 66 of their first-degree relatives (FDR), and compared these data to 636 Swedish general population controls (GP). Previously reported disease-related alleles in the HLA-DRB5*01:01:01-DRB1*15:01:01-DQA1*01:02:01-DQB1*06:02:01 extended haplotype were increased in NT1 patients (34/62 haplotypes, 54.8%) compared to GP (194/1272 haplotypes, 15.3%, p = 6.17E-16). Indeed, this extended haplotype was found in 30/31 patients (96.8%) and 178/636 GP (28.0%). In total, 15 alleles, four extended haplotypes, and six genotypes were found to be increased or decreased in frequency among NT1 patients compared to GP. Among subjects with the HLA-DRB5*01:01:01-DRB1*15:01:01-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 haplotype, a second DRB4*01:03:01-DRB1*04:01:01-DQA1*03:02//*03:03:01-DQB1*03:01:01 haplotype (p = 2.02E-2), but not homozygosity for DRB1*15:01:01-DQB1*06:02:01 (p = 7.49E-1) conferred association to NT1. Alleles with increased frequency in DQA1*01:02:01 (p = 1.07E-2) and DQA1*03:02//*03:03:01 (p = 3.26E-2), as well as with decreased frequency in DRB3*01:01:02 (p = 8.09E-3), DRB1*03:01:01 (p = 1.40E-2), and DQB1*02:01:01 (p = 1.40E-2) were found among patients compared to their FDR. High-resolution HLA sequencing in Pandemrix-associated NT1 confirmed the strong association with the DQB1*06:02:01-containing haplotype but also revealed an increased association to the not previously reported extended HLA-DRB4*01:03:01-DRB1*04:01:01-DQA1*03:02//*03:03:01-DQB1*03:01:01 haplotype. High-resolution HLA typing should prove useful in dissecting the immunological mechanisms of vaccination-associated NT1."
https://openalex.org/W2977284782,"Crangonyx islandicus is a groundwater amphipod endemic to Iceland, considered to have survived the Ice Ages in subglacial refugia. Currently the species is found in spring sources in lava fields along the tectonic plate boundary of the country. The discovery of a groundwater species in this inaccessible habitat indicates a hidden ecosystem possibly based on chemoautotrophic microorganisms as primary producers. To explore this spring ecosystem, we assessed its microbial diversity and analysed whether and how the diversity varied between the amphipods and the spring water, and if was dependent on environmental factors and geological settings. Isolated DNA from spring water and from amphipods was analysed using metabarcoding methods, targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Two genera of bacteria, Halomonas and Shewanella were dominating in the amphipod samples in terms of relative abundance, but not in the groundwater samples where Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas and Alkanindiges among others were dominating. The richness of the bacteria taxa in the microbial community of the groundwater spring sources was shaped by pH level and the beta diversity was shaped by geographic locations."

How GPCRs recruit and activate the Rabs is unclear. Here, we report that depletion of endogenous L-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) in HeLa cells inhibited recycling of the prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) DP1 receptor (DP1) to the cell surface after agonist-induced internalization and that L-PGDS overexpression had the opposite effect. Depletion of endogenous Rab4 prevented l-PGDS–mediated recycling of DP1, and l-PGDS depletion inhibited Rab4-dependent recycling of DP1, indicating that both proteins are mutually involved in this pathway. DP1 stimulation promoted its interaction through its intracellular C terminus with Rab4, which was increased by l-PGDS. Confocal microscopy revealed that DP1 activation induces l-PGDS/Rab4 co-localization. l-PGDS/Rab4 and DP1/Rab4 co-immunoprecipitation levels were increased by DP1 agonist treatment. Pulldown assays with purified GST-l-PGDS and His6-Rab4 indicated that both proteins interact directly. l-PGDS interacted preferentially with the inactive, GDP-locked Rab4S22N variant rather than with WT Rab4 or with constitutively active Rab4Q67L proteins. Overexpression and depletion experiments disclosed that l-PGDS partakes in Rab4 activation following DP1 stimulation. Experiments with deletion mutants and synthetic peptides revealed that amino acids 85–92 in l-PGDS are involved in its interaction with Rab4 and in its effect on DP1 recycling. Of note, GTPγS loading and time-resolved FRET assays with purified proteins suggested that l-PGDS enhances GDP-GTP exchange on Rab4.

https://openalex.org/W2978503611,"As a leading cause of neonatal sepsis, Streptococcus agalactiae, commonly known as Group B Streptococcus, is a major neonatal pathogen. Current global screening practices employ risk- or culture-based protocols for detection of these organisms. In Western Australia (WA), universal culture-based screening is provided, with subsequent intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for all S. agalactiae-positive women during labour. Widespread antibiotic exposure is not ideal and this is one of the factors driving development of vaccines against S. agalactiae. Vaccine candidates have focused on the capsule, surface proteins and pilus types, however, capsule serotypes are known to vary geographically. The aim of this study was to use genome sequencing to gain an understanding of the circulating genotypes in WA, and to assess variations in the associated gene pools. We sequenced 141 antenatal carriage (vaginal/rectal) isolates and 10 neonatal invasive disease isolates from WA. Based on the global PubMLST database, the 151 strains were characterised into 30 sequence types, with clustering of these mainly into clonal complexes 1, 12, 17, 19 and 23. Of the genes encoding eleven surface proteins that were analysed, the most prevalent were fbp, lmb and scpB which were present in ≥ 98% of isolates. A cluster of non-haemolytic isolates, one of which was a neonatal invasive disease isolate, appeared to lack the entire cyl locus. Admixture analysis of population structure revealed evidence of genetic transfer among the WA isolates across structural groups. When compared against the PubMLST S. agalactiae data, WA isolates showed high levels of strain diversity with minimal apparent clustering. This is the first whole genome sequence study of WA S. agalactiae isolates and also represents the first addition of Australian isolate data to PubMLST. This report provides insight into the distribution and diversity of vaccine targets of S. agalactiae within Western Australia, indicating that the most appropriate capsular vaccine for this population would be the proposed pentavalent (Cps Ia, Ib, II, III and V) preparation, whilst vaccines targeting surface proteins should ideally utilise Fbp, Lmb and/or ScpB."

However, most existing solutions of data-hiding need to encrypt secret data first, and embed the encrypt message into cover image, which is not promising any security once the embedding algorithm is leaked. In this paper, an efficient and adaptive data hiding scheme is presented which is based on a new reference matrix named secure reference matrix. The scheme is flexible enough to meet different data hiding capacities and image quality as needed, and we allow the reference matrix to be more secure since it is randomly generated each time and make it much harder for being attack with exhaustive manner by extending the possible solution. We give the detail protocol for our scheme and provide the practical test and performance analysis. Experimental results show that our scheme has a better flexibility and efficiency in embedding process, and the average value of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) for the stego-images which are generated by our scheme have a higher visual quality for different embedding capacities, and our scheme is more efficient compared with related work."
https://openalex.org/W2978383094,"In this study, we analyzed PRRS virus (PRRSv) specific lymphocyte function in piglets vaccinated with Ingelvac PRRSFLEX EU® at two and three weeks of age in the presence of homologous maternal immunity. Complete analysis of maternal immunity to PRRSv was evaluated postpartum, as well as passive transfer of antibodies and T cells to the piglet through colostrum intake and before and after challenge with a heterologous PRRSv at ten weeks of age. Maternal-derived antibodies were detected in piglets but declined quickly after weaning. However, vaccinated animals restored PRRSv-specific antibody levels by anamnestic response to vaccination. Cell analysis in colostrum and milk revealed presence of PRRSv-specific immune cells at suckling with higher concentrations found in colostrum than in milk. In addition, colostrum and milk contained PRRSv-specific IgA and IgG that may contribute to protection of newborn piglets. Despite the presence of PRRSv-specific Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in colostrum and milk, no PRRSv-specific cells could be detected from blood of the piglets at one or two weeks of life. Nevertheless, cellular immunity was detectable in pre-challenged piglets up to 7 weeks after vaccination while the non-vaccinated control group showed no interferon (IFN) γ response to PRRSv stimulation. After challenge, all piglets developed a PRRSv-specific IFNγ-response, which was more robust at significantly higher levels in vaccinated animals compared to the primary response to PRRSv in non-vaccinated animals. Cytokine analysis in the lung lumen showed a reduction of pro-inflammatory responses to PRRSv challenge in vaccinated animals, especially reduced interferon (IFN) α levels. In conclusion, vaccination of maternally positive piglets at 2 and 3 weeks of age with Ingelvac PRRSFLEX EU induced a humoral and cellular immune response to PRRSv and provided protection against virulent, heterologous PRRSv challenge."

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to which bacteria do not develop resistance easily may be the last hope. A few independent experimental studies have designed and studied the activity of AMPs on A. baumannii, however the number of such studies are still limited. With the goal of developing a rational approach to the screening of AMPs against A. baumannii, we carefully curated the drug activity data from 75 cationic AMPs, all measured with a similar protocol, and on the same ATCC 19606 strain. A quantitative model developed and validated with a part of the data. While the model may be used for predicting the activity of any designed AMPs, in this work, we perform an in silico screening for the entire database of naturally occurring AMPs, to provide a rational guidance in this urgently needed drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2978291880,"Background The mitochondrial genome encodes for thirty-seven proteins, among them thirteen are essential for the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Inherited variation in mitochondrial genes may influence cancer development through changes in mitochondrial proteins, altering the OXPHOS process and promoting the production of reactive oxidative species. Methods To investigate the association between mitochondrial genetic variation and breast cancer risk, we tested 314 mitochondrial SNPs (mtSNPs), capturing four complexes of the mitochondrial OXPHOS pathway and mtSNP groupings for rRNA and tRNA, in 2,723 breast cancer cases and 3,260 controls from the Multiethnic Cohort Study. Results We examined the collective set of 314 mtSNPs as well as subsets of mtSNPs grouped by mitochondrial OXPHOS pathway, complexes, and genes, using the sequence kernel association test and adjusting for age, sex, and principal components of global ancestry. We also tested haplogroup associations using unconditional logistic regression and adjusting for the same covariates. Stratified analyses were conducted by self-reported maternal race/ethnicity. No significant mitochondrial OXPHOS pathway, gene, and haplogroup associations were observed in African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, and Native Hawaiians. In European Americans, a global test of all genetic variants of the mitochondrial genome identified an association with breast cancer risk (P = 0.017, q = 0.102). In mtSNP-subset analysis, the gene MT-CO2 (P = 0.001, q = 0.09) in Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) and MT-ND2 (P = 0.004, q = 0.19) in Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone)) were significantly associated with breast cancer risk. Conclusions In summary, our findings suggest that collective mitochondrial genetic variation and particularly in the MT-CO2 and MT-ND2 may play a role in breast cancer risk among European Americans. Further replication is warranted in larger populations and future studies should evaluate the contribution of mitochondrial proteins encoded by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes to breast cancer risk."

Employees of large farms and H-2A workers (lawfully admitted, nonimmigrant workers performing temporary or seasonal agricultural work) are protected by minimum wage legislation, while some migrant workers (often those paid piece rates) are exempt. U.S. agriculture also is characterized by a large percentage of unauthorized workers who may or may not earn above minimum wage. Following insights from dual labor market theory and from theories of the signaling capacity of the minimum wage, we compare labor market outcomes in the agricultural sector (where minimum wage coverage is limited) to low wage/skill non-agricultural sectors (where minimum wage coverage is more complete) nationally using data from the Current Population Survey. We then extend our analysis to a detailed state-level case study of agricultural workers in California using a representative survey of employed farm workers. Results suggest wage increases for covered workers that exceed those for uncovered workers, but insignificant differences in hours worked. This is the first study to our knowledge to examine the impacts of minimum wage coverage on agricultural workers relative to other workers for the U.S."

https://openalex.org/W2977290983,"Background TB/HIV coinfection is a serious public health issue in Brazil, and patients with coinfection have difficulty adhering to treatments. Directly observed treatment (DOT) has been recommended by the World Health Organization, considering the vulnerability of those affected. The purpose is to investigate the occurrence of DOT and associated factors compared to conventional treatment in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Methods A retrospective cohort study was carried out with all patients with coinfection from 2009 to 2013 in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, the state capital with the highest rate of coinfection in Brazil. The data came from national health information systems. The dependent variable was the performance of DOT. Bivariate and multivariable models were used to determine factors associated with DOT. The percentage of cure and death was verified in a period of two years, comparing patients who received and did not receive DOT. Results 2,400 cases of coinfection were reported, with 1,574 males and 826 females and a mean age of 38 years ± 9.91 years. The occurrence of DOT was 16.9%. In the multivariable analysis, factors independently associated to DOT were the year (with greater chances of being received in 2012 and 2013), place of origin, non-white race (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.08–1.54), cases of relapse (OR = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.03–1.73), readmission after abandonment (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.20–1.83), transfer (OR = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.40–2.98), acid-fast bacilli (AFB) test with positive result in first sample (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.24–2.42), alcohol abuse (OR = 1.39; 95% CI = 1.16–1.67), and mental disorders (OR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.38–2.44.) Of the 532 cases of death, occurring in two years, 10.2% were in patients who underwent DOT and 89.8% in patients who did not undergo DOT (p<0.001). O percentual de óbitos em pessoas que receberam DOT foi de 13% e o percentual de óbitos para pessoas que receberam tratamento convencional foi de 24%. Conclusions There was an increase in the percentage of DOT over the years in the scenario studied, and the predictors for DOT were related to social vulnerability. In relation to death within two years, a lower proportion was found in patients who underwent DOT, suggesting a protective effect of the strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2977774534,"This paper presents the Hybrid Scalable-Minimized-Butterfly-Fat-Tree (H-SMBFT) topology for on-chip communication. Main aspects of this work are the description of the architectural design and the characteristics as well as a comparative analysis against two established indirect topologies namely Butterfly-Fat-Tree (BFT) and Scalable-Minimized-Butterfly-Fat-Tree (SMBFT). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed topology outperforms its predecessors in terms of performance, area and power dissipation. Specifically, it improves the link interconnectivity between routing levels, such that the number of required links isreduced. This results into reduced router complexity and shortened routing paths between any pair of communicating nodes in the network. Moreover, simulation results under synthetic as well as real-world embedded applications workloads reveal that H-SMBFT can reduce the average latency by up-to35.63% and 17.36% compared to BFT and SMBFT, respectively. In addition, the power dissipation of the network can be reduced by up-to33.82% and 19.45%, while energy consumption can be improved byup-to32.91% and 16.83% compared to BFT and SMBFT, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2977878374,"Background/Objectives This study examined the best practices with regard to infant and young child feeding in emergency (IYCF-E) program. This was done by observing a breastfeeding support scenario through wet nursing in Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. Methods Information on demographics, IYCF-E knowledge, wet nursing support, type of constraints faced, and possible ways to overcome such constraints was collected through face-to-face interviews with 24 conveniently selected wet nurses. Linear regression was used to analyze the associations. Results Mean age of wet nurses was 21.6 years; 16.67% had adequate knowledge about IYCF-E; and 29.17% had prior knowledge about wet nursing. Mean age of supported infants was 1.29 months, and 58.33% had a familial relationship with the wet nurses. Duration of breastfeeding support was significantly associated with the wet nurse’s age, age of the wet nurses’ youngest children, familial relationship with infants, knowledge about IYCF-E, and follow-ups from community nutrition workers (Ps <0.05). The status of facing problems (58.33%) was negatively correlated with duration of wet nursing, although this association was not statistically significant. The most extensively reported problems were as follows: misunderstandings with the infant’s family (85.71%), family workload and time limitations (21.43%), household distance (42.86%), and family members’ poor compliance (21.43%). Counseling from community nutrition workers (64.29%) and mediation by community leaders (57.14%) played key roles in mitigating such problems. Self-satisfaction (37.50%), counseling (62.50%), and religious inspiration (58.33%) were key motivators behind dedicated breastfeeding support. Conclusion Wet nursing in the Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh, was associated with several factors involving both supply and demand. The present findings may help design better IYCF-E programs in similar context."
https://openalex.org/W2977458428,"Niche theory suggests that the coexistence of ecologically similar species in the same site requires some form of resource partitioning that reduces or avoids interspecific competition. Here, from July 2013 to December 2015, we investigated spatial niche differentiation at three different scales of two sympatric congeneric spiders, Peucetia rubrolineata and P. flava, along an altitudinal gradient in shaded and open areas in an Atlantic forest in Serra do Japi, SP, Brazil. These spiders are peculiar in that they present an exclusive association with the plant Trichogoniopsis adenantha (Asteraceae). In theory, the coexistence of two Peucetia species could be explained by: (1) microhabitat segregation with individuals from different species occupying different parts of the same plants; (2) mesohabitat segregation with different species using plant in different environments; (3) macrohabitat segregation, where different species would not co-occur along the altitudinal gradient. With respect to micro-habitat use, in both species, different instars used different plant parts, while the same instars of both species used the same type of substrate. However, the two Peucetia species segregated by meso-habitat type, with P. rubrolineata preferring T. adenantha plants in shaded areas and P. flava preferring those in open areas. Our results support the hypothesis of niche partitioning begetting diversity, and highlight the importance of analyzing habitat use at multiple scales to understand mechanisms related to coexistence."
https://openalex.org/W2978268188,"Previous research has shown alcohol misuse amplifies the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections [STIs], including HIV, by increasing high risk sexual behaviors. Military populations are particularly vulnerable to both alcohol misuse and STIs due to the unique conditions of military service. This study estimated the prevalence of probable hazardous and harmful alcohol use and examined associations with transactional sex, sex with a sex worker, and multiple sexual partners among military personnel in the Armed Forces of the Republic of the Congo (FAC).A secondary analysis of data collected from a 2014 seroprevalence and behavioral epidemiology risk survey was performed. Participants included 703 active duty male service members 18 years of age or older who reported ever having sex. Patterns of harmful and hazardous drinking were measured with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Participants with an AUDIT score ≥ 8 (indicative of probable hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and possible alcohol dependence) were compared to those with an AUDIT score ≤ 7.A total of 15.8% received a score of 8 or higher on the AUDIT. These participants were more likely to be lower educated and of lower military rank. In separate multivariable models, an AUDIT score ≥ 8 was significantly associated with higher odds of sex with a commercial sex worker and having multiple sexual partners.Study results emphasize the need to address patterns of harmful and hazardous alcohol use in the FAC and integrate alcohol misuse education into the HIV prevention program. The development of military-specific interventions to reduce alcohol-related risky sexual behaviors are also needed. Lastly, implementing policies such as restricting alcohol availability and sales on military bases, and adding warning labels to advertisements and containers may provide a more comprehensive response to reduce problematic alcohol use."

We demonstrated that whereas in the bristle ""somal"" region Golgi units are composed of cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi compartments (""complete Golgi""), the bristle shaft contains Golgi satellites that lack the trans-Golgi compartment (hereafter referred to as ""incomplete Golgi"") and which are static and localized at the base area. However, in Dhc64C mutants, the entire bristle shaft was filled with complete Golgi units containing ectopic trans-Golgi components. To further understand Golgi bristle organization, we tested the roles of microtubule (MT) polarity and the Dhc-opposing motor, kinesin heavy chain (Khc). For our surprise, we found that in Khc and Ik2Dominant-negative (DN) flies in which the polarized organization of MTs is affected, the bristle shaft was filled with complete Golgi, similarly to what is seen in Dhc64C flies. Thus, we demonstrated that MTs and the motor proteins Dhc and Khc are required for bristle Golgi organization. However, the fact that both Dhc64C and Khc flies showed similar Golgi defects calls for an additional work to elucidate the molecular mechanism describing why these factors are required for bristle Golgi organization."
