https://openalex.org/W2094169801,"Schistosoma mansoni is responsible for the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis that affects 210 million people in 76 countries. Here we present analysis of the 363 megabase nuclear genome of the blood fluke. It encodes at least 11,809 genes, with an unusual intron size distribution, and new families of micro-exon genes that undergo frequent alternative splicing. As the first sequenced flatworm, and a representative of the Lophotrochozoa, it offers insights into early events in the evolution of the animals, including the development of a body pattern with bilateral symmetry, and the development of tissues into organs. Our analysis has been informed by the need to find new drug targets. The deficits in lipid metabolism that make schistosomes dependent on the host are revealed, and the identification of membrane receptors, ion channels and more than 300 proteases provide new insights into the biology of the life cycle and new targets. Bioinformatics approaches have identified metabolic chokepoints, and a chemogenomic screen has pinpointed schistosome proteins for which existing drugs may be active. The information generated provides an invaluable resource for the research community to develop much needed new control tools for the treatment and eradication of this important and neglected disease. Two international consortia this week report the whole genome sequences of the blood flukes Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum, two of the three major pathogens that cause schistosomiasis, also called bilharzia. Schistosomiasis is a 'neglected' tropical disease affecting more than 200 million people in 76 countries. Analyses of the new genome sequences provide insights into the molecular architecture and host interactions of these pathogens, as well as avenues for future development of targeted interventions for this disease. These are the first two flatworm genomes to be sequenced, so they offer new angles on the early events in animal evolution, in particular the determination of body pattern and the development of tissues into organs. Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum are the pathogenic agents that cause the tropical disease schistosomiasis. Here, and in an accompanying paper, the genomes of these two flatworms are sequenced and analysed. The results provide insights into the molecular architecture and host interactions of the flatworms, as well as avenues for future development of targeted interventions for schistosomiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2121379737,"Examining the behavioral consequences of selective CNS neuronal activation is a powerful tool for elucidating mammalian brain function in health and disease. Newly developed genetic, pharmacological, and optical tools allow activation of neurons with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution; however, the inaccessibility to light of widely distributed neuronal populations and the invasiveness required for activation by light or infused ligands limit the utility of these methods. To overcome these barriers, we created transgenic mice expressing an evolved G protein-coupled receptor (hM3Dq) selectively activated by the pharmacologically inert, orally bioavailable drug clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). Here, we expressed hM3Dq in forebrain principal neurons. Local field potential and single-neuron recordings revealed that peripheral administration of CNO activated hippocampal neurons selectively in hM3Dq-expressing mice. Behavioral correlates of neuronal activation included increased locomotion, stereotypy, and limbic seizures. These results demonstrate a powerful chemical-genetic tool for remotely controlling the activity of discrete populations of neurons in vivo.

These results demonstrate a powerful chemical-genetic tool for remotely controlling the activity of discrete populations of neurons in vivo. Methods to examine the behavioral consequences of activation of neuronal ensembles are powerful tools for understanding brain function, as exemplified by Wilder Penfield's pioneering studies of focal electrical stimulation of human cortex (Penfield and Jasper, 1954Penfield W. Jasper H.H. Epilepsy and the Functional Anatomy of the Human Brain.First Edition. Little Brown, Boston1954Google Scholar). The development of genetic and optical tools to visualize and activate neuronal activity with exquisite temporal resolution using microbial opsins (e.g., channelrhodopsin-2, halorhodopsin, Volvox carteri channelrhodopsin, optoXRs) has provided an expanding toolbox for decoding the neuronal correlates of brain function (Berndt et al., 2009Berndt A.

Temporally precise in vivo control of intracellular signalling.Nature. 2009; 458: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). However, the equipment, technological expertise, and invasiveness required for light-mediated activation, together with the relative inaccessibility to light of scattered neuronal populations, limits the potential applicability of these methods. Ideally, noninvasive remote control of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain would provide a valuable tool for elucidating how the activity of discrete populations of neurons and local circuits underlies behavior in health and disease. Accordingly, we sought to develop a chemical-genetic approach to control neuronal activity noninvasively in the mammalian brain by regulating signaling through a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Others have worked toward similar goals (see Luo et al., 2008Luo L. Callaway E.M. Svoboda K. Genetic dissection of neural circuits.Neuron. 2008; 57: 634-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, for review), and our work represents an effort to advance this field. In addition to the opsin-receptor chimeras (optoXRs) mentioned above, existing approaches to manipulating GPCR signaling pathways in neurons both in vitro and in vivo include ectopic expression of either GPCRs with engineered binding sites (e.g., Receptors Activated Solely by Synthetic Ligands, or RASSLs [Redfern et al., 1999Redfern C.H.

These approaches represent important advances for the pharmacological manipulation of neuronal activity and are valuable for many applications. However, continued improvements are needed to facilitate regulation of activity of discrete populations of CNS neurons selectively and noninvasively in vivo. RASSLs, for example, are activated by nonselective, pharmacologically active small molecules and in some tissues exhibit high levels of signaling in the absence of exogenous small-molecule agonists. Indeed, ectopic expression of RASSLs can result in pathologic phenotypes (Hsiao et al., 2008Hsiao E.C. Boudignon B.M. Chang W.C. Bencsik M. Peng J. Nguyen T.D. Manalac C. Halloran B.P. Conklin B.R.

The AlstR, while displaying no evidence of basal signaling, does not allow for remote manipulations of neuronal activity, as its ligand is unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier and must be directly infused into brain tissue (Tan et al., 2006Tan E.M. Yamaguchi Y. Horwitz G.D. Gosgnach S. Lein E.S. Goulding M. Albright T.D. Callaway E.M. Selective and quickly reversible inactivation of mammalian neurons in vivo using the Drosophila allatostatin receptor.Neuron. 2006; 51: 157-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, the AlstR is not used for neuronal activation, as its activity couples only to neuronal silencing. To advance these methods, we sought to develop a system for neuronal regulation in which (1) the exogenous ligand would be pharmacologically inert, (2) the exogenous ligand could be administered in the periphery and cross the blood-brain barrier to access receptors in deep brain structures and/or widely distributed neuronal populations, (3) receptor expression alone would not induce pathology (4) neuronal activity could be both increased and decreased, and (5) both spatial and temporal resolution would be sufficient to facilitate study of brain function in health and disease. With this ideal in mind, we used directed molecular evolution to develop a new generation of RASSLs, which we refer to as Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADDs), derived from the human muscarinic receptors (Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L. Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Engineered GPCRs as tools to modulate signal transduction.Physiology (Bethesda). 2008; 23: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This molecular evolution resulted in reduced potency and efficacy of the native ligand (acetylcholine) and high potency and efficacy of the orally bioavailable (Bender et al., 1994Bender D. Holschbach M. Stocklin G. Synthesis of n.c.a. carbon-11 labelled clozapine and its major metabolite clozapine-N-oxide and comparison of their biodistribution in mice.Nucl. Med. Biol. 1994; 21: 921-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), pharmacologically inert ligand, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H.

Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Importantly, these DREADDs lack detectable constitutive activity in vitro (Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L. Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5163-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar) and, thus, provide an attractive receptor-effector complex for modifying neuronal activity remotely. Furthermore, this system allows for manipulation of Gi-, Gq-, and Gs-coupled pathways (Pei et al., 2008Pei Y. Rogan S.C. Yan F. Roth B.L. Engineered GPCRs as tools to modulate signal transduction.Physiology (Bethesda). 2008; 23: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here, as a proof of concept, we describe a method by which the activity of identified populations of CNS neurons is regulated noninvasively in vivo. For these studies, we produced mice that express the Gq-coupled human M3 muscarinic DREADD (hM3Dq) specifically in principal neurons within the forebrain, particularly in the hippocampus and cortex, by driving expression in double-transgenic mice in a reversible fashion with the CAMKIIα tet transactivator (tTA; Mayford et al., 1996Mayford M. Bach M.E. Huang Y.Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Control of memory formation through regulated expression of a CaMKII transgene.Science. 1996; 274: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). We then recorded local field potential (LFP) and single-unit activity within hippocampus and showed a correlation between changes in neuronal activity and behaviors induced by the peripheral administration of CNO in mutant mice. We demonstrate CNO-mediated neuronal activation within hippocampus, as measured by dose-dependent changes in the LFP and increases in the firing rate of interneurons (likely driven by principal neuron firing). Moreover, excessive activation of this pathway by high-dose CNO resulted in limbic seizures and status epilepticus. The selective activation of GPCRs in defined neuronal populations afforded by this chemical-genetic approach provides an improved tool for the study of mammalian brain function in health and disease. Previously, we showed in vitro that hM3Dq signals exclusively via the canonical Gq pathway in nonneuronal cell types (Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L. Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5163-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, Conklin et al., 2008Conklin B.R. Hsiao E.C. Claeysen S. Dumuis A. Srinivasan S. Forsayeth J.R. Guettier J.M. Chang W.C. Pei Y. McCarthy K.D. et al.Engineering GPCR signaling pathways with RASSLs.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To assess whether hM3Dq couples to Gq in mixed neuronal-glial cultures, we visualized calcium flux with a calcium-sensitive dye in primary cultures of mouse postnatal day 1 (P1) hippocampal cells infected with hM3Dq-transducing lentivirus. CNO stimulated calcium transients only in those neurons expressing hM3Dq (identified by an IRES-driven mCherry reporter) and was without effect in uninfected neurons (Figure S1 and Movies S1 and S2 available online). Having thus demonstrated that hM3Dq conferred the ability to stimulate neuronal Gq signaling in vitro, we sought to determine whether expression of hM3Dq could alter neuronal function in vivo. We first generated transgenic mice expressing tetracycline-sensitive HA-tagged hM3Dq using the Tet-off system (i.e., transgene expression is repressed upon administration of tetracycline or its analog, doxycycline). This system allows for inducible, spatiotemporally regulated transgene expression. Pronuclear injection of B6SJL hybrid mouse oocytes with Tet Response Element (TRE)-hM3Dq DNA (Figure 1A) resulted in the birth of 35 mouse pups, of which ten carried the transgene. To determine whether we could achieve brain-region-specific expression of the hM3Dq protein, we crossed TRE-hM3Dq founders with CaMKIIα-tTA mice in which tTA expression is targeted to principal neurons mainly in cortex, hippocampus, and striatum (Mayford et al., 1996Mayford M. Bach M.E. Huang Y.Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Control of memory formation through regulated expression of a CaMKII transgene.Science. 1996; 274: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). We removed the brains from F1 adults and immunoprecipitated HA-hM3Dq protein from membrane fractions of whole-brain (minus cerebellum) homogenates. Initial immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitates revealed expression of HA-hM3Dq in double-transgenic (both TRE-hM3Dq and tTA transgenes) F1 progeny from two of the founder mice (data not shown). Subsequent studies of mutant F1 progeny from both sets of founder mice did not reveal any differences in receptor expression or activity; therefore, we chose only one of the founder lines (line 1) for subsequent studies. Hereafter, we refer to the mice from this line, which express HA-hM3Dq driven by the CaMKIIα promoter, as hM3Dq mice. Having determined that the CaMKIIα-tTA transgene effectively drives hM3Dq expression in the brain, we next sought to repress hM3Dq expression by doxycycline administration. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses similar to those described above revealed undetectable hM3Dq expression in both hM3Dq F1 progeny fed doxycycline-containing chow (200 mg/kg) for 1 month and single-transgenic (TRE-hM3Dq transgene only) mice fed normal chow (Figure 1C). These findings demonstrated, first, that doxycycline successfully repressed tTA-driven hM3Dq expression in vivo and, second, that hM3Dq expression could be temporally regulated. To examine the spatial distribution of transgene expression, we prepared coronal brain sections for immunofluorescence and probed them with an anti-HA antibody. We found that immunofluorescence was most intense in the cortex and hippocampus (Figures 2A–2C), as expected for CaMKIIα-tTA-driven transgene expression (Mayford et al., 1996Mayford M. Bach M.E. Huang Y.Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Control of memory formation through regulated expression of a CaMKII transgene.Science. 1996; 274: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Within the hippocampus, immunofluorescence was most intense in CA1 strata radiatum and oriens (Figure 2A), a pattern consistent with expression in the apical and basal dendrites of CA1 pyramids. Confocal immunofluorescent microscopic analysis of single CA1 pyramidal cells confirmed immunoreactivity in the soma and apical and basal dendrites (Figure 2B). Apical dendrite immunoreactivity was also detected in cortex (Figure 2C). Importantly, inclusion of doxycycline in the diet resulted in no detectable immunoreactivity in either cerebral cortex or CA1 (compare Figures 2D and 2E). Additionally, a Nissl stain revealed no overt structural differences between WT and hM3Dq mice (Figure S2). To obtain independent evidence of hM3Dq expression in the hM3Dq mice, we measured the Bmax of [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) binding in cortical and hippocampal membranes from wild-type and hM3Dq mice. Radioligand competition binding isotherms were first modeled based on prior affinity estimates obtained with cloned wild-type and hM3Dq receptors expressed in vitro (KD = 0.05 nM at hM3; KD = 1.6 nM at HA-hM3Dq; Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L. Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5163-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). We conducted computerized simulations with Prism 4.0 using different concentrations of [3H]QNB and various ratios of native to transgenic receptor expression in order to determine the optimal concentration of [3H]QNB, a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, for detection of both endogenous muscarinic receptors and hM3Dq receptors. Having determined the optimal assay conditions, competition curves were then obtained using unlabeled acetylcholine (which binds hM3Dq, albeit with lower affinity compared to wild-type mAChRs; Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L. Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5163-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar) and [3H]QNB. Data were fit simultaneously by LIGAND (Munson and Rodbard, 1980Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Ligand: a versatile computerized approach for characterization of ligand-binding systems.Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7716) Google Scholar) using weighted nonlinear regression analysis and a two-site model, which best described all data sets (by F test). In hM3Dq tissue, a distinct site emerged for which ACh had low affinity (1.0 mM in cortex, 1.7 mM in hippocampus) (Figure 2F and Table S1). The affinity of ACh for this site was similar to that of ACh for cloned hM3Dq, but not wild-type muscarinic, receptors (Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L. Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5163-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). The inclusion of doxycycline in the diet of hM3Dq mice eliminated this low-affinity site (Table S1). We concluded that (1) this low-affinity ACh site accounted for the difference in Bmax between hM3Dq and wild-type or doxycycline-treated tissue and that (2) the difference in Bmax was due to hM3Dq transgene expression. Indeed, computerized nonlinear least-squares regression analysis taking into account the difference in affinity of [3H]QNB for the hM3Dq and native mAChRs revealed an increase of 4- and 7-fold in the Bmax of [3H]QNB binding to membranes isolated from cortex and hippocampus, respectively, of hM3Dq compared to WT mice (Figure 2G and Table S1). These data indicate that hM3Dq was expressed in both cortex and hippocampus at levels greater than endogenous muscarinic receptors. A major goal of the evolution of the second generation of RASSLs was to minimize constitutive activity of hM3Dq and also to eliminate the activation of hM3Dq by endogenous ACh, thus limiting hM3Dq signaling in vivo in the absence of CNO. When expressed in yeast, cultured mammalian cells, and mouse pancreatic β-cells, no detectable constitutive activity of hM3Dq in the absence of CNO was found (Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L. Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5163-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar; J.-M. Guettier et al., personal communication). To test whether hM3Dq expression in vivo modified behavior in the absence of its exogenous activating ligand (CNO), we examined mouse appearance and behavior through a battery of neurobehavioral tests on single-transgenic (TRE-hM3Dq transgene only) and hM3Dq mice (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figures S3–S7; n = 11 littermate pairs). No qualitative differences were evident between control and hM3Dq mice. Specifically, the two groups were similar in observations regarding size, overall morphology, coat condition, body posture and gait, reflex response to gentle touch with a cotton swab on the whiskers or eyes, balance in an empty, shifting plastic cage, ability to climb a pole or walk across an elevated dowel, grip-strength in a wire-hang test, and responses during 20 s of tail-suspension. A variety of quantitative assessments of behavior were also performed. We quantified motor coordination using an accelerating rotarod, the results of which revealed no significant differences between hM3Dq and control mice (Figure S3). Likewise, no significant differences were detected in the elevated plus maze, acoustic startle response, prepulse inhibition of startle responses (PPI), latency to locate a food reward buried in bedding, the Morris water maze visual cue test, or acquisition and reversal learning in the Morris water maze (Figures S4–S6). In contrast to these measures that revealed no differences between the two genotypes, we did find subtle but unremarkable differences with respect to activity in an open field (Figure S7). hM3Dq mice demonstrated a tendency toward reduced locomotor activity as measured by total distance traveled in a locomotor chamber [F(1,20) = 6.15, p < 0.05] (Figure S7A). They further demonstrated fewer fine, stereotypic movements [F(1,20) = 6.63, p = 0.0181] (Figure S7B). However, no differences in rearing movements or in time spent in the center of the open field were detected (data not shown). Apart from the mild reduction of spontaneous locomotor activity, the hM3Dq mice were similar to controls on an extensive battery of tests of diverse behaviors, implying that overexpression of a Gq-coupled receptor has minimal untoward effects. After characterizing the behavior of hM3Dq mice in the absence of exogenous ligand, we sought to determine the effects of hM3Dq receptor activation by CNO. We first asked whether neurons from hM3Dq animals would respond to CNO. To address this question, we isolated acute hippocampal slices from hM3Dq and littermate control animals and performed whole-cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in the absence and presence of bath-applied CNO. To isolate membrane potential responses from synaptic responses, we performed these recordings in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). We found that bath application of CNO (500 nM) to hippocampal slices isolated from hM3Dq mice depolarized CA1 pyramidal cells by 8.0 ± 1.8 mV compared with baseline membrane potentials (p < 0.01; n = 7 neurons from 5 animals; Figures 3Ai and 3Aiii). In contrast to these findings in hM3Dq mice, we found no significant change in membrane potential of CA1 pyramidal neurons of hippocampal slices isolated from control (either single transgenic or wild-type) mice (p > 0.05, n = 7 neurons from 5 animals; Figures 3Aii an 3Aiii). We additionally asked whether bath application of CNO to hippocampal slices isolated from hM3Dq mice would increase the firing rate of CA1 pyramidal neurons. To that end, we performed whole-cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells in the absence of TTX. We found that bath application of CNO (500 nM) in the absence of TTX increased the firing rate of CA1 pyramidal cells (n = 8 neurons from 4 animals; Figure 3C). Because Gq signaling can affect membrane conductances through phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent mechanisms, we tested the dependence of the CNO-evoked depolarization on PLC. We performed whole-cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells in acute slices isolated from hM3Dq animals in the presence of TTX and the PLC inhibitor, U73122 (10 μM), and then bath applied CNO (500 nM). We found that in the presence of U73122, CNO had no significant effect on the membrane potential of CA1 pyramidal cells (p > 0.05, n = 6 neurons from 4 animals; Figures 3Bi and 3Biii). By contrast, in the presence of U73343 (10 μM), the inactive analog of U73122, CNO produced a significant depolarization of CA1 pyramidal neurons by 5.0 ± 0.72 mV (p < 0.01, n = 4 neurons from 4 animals; Figures 3Bii and 3Biii). These findings indicate that CNO-induced activation of hM3Dq depolarizes and increases the firing rate of CA1 pyramidal neurons through a PLC-dependent mechanism. Treatment of hM3Dq but not WT mice with CNO induced striking behavioral effects. Using a cohort of adult mice distinct from that in which baseline behavioral characterization was performed, we measured ambulation and episodes of repetitive beam breaks (generally representing fine movements or stereotypic behaviors) following peripheral administration of vehicle (saline) and low-dose (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) CNO (n = 10 hM3Dq; n = 14 controls). Among hM3Dq mice, significant behavioral effects were noted. When CNO was administered, activity (both total ambulation and repetitive beam breaks) increased in a dose-dependent fashion among hM3Dq mice and exceeded control levels. The administration of 0.1 mg/kg CNO resulted in a significant increase in repetitive beam breaks (p < 0.01) and a trend toward a significant increase in total locomotion in hM3Dq mice relative to controls. Administration of 0.3 mg/kg CNO produced a statistically significant increase in both total locomotion and repeated beam breaks in hM3Dq mice relative to controls (p < 0.01; Figures 4Ai and 4Bi). Furthermore, the increases in locomotion and repetitive beam breaks following CNO administration occurred in a time-dependent manner, such that locomotor activity gradually increased with time relative to controls (Figures 4Aii and 4Bii), and the increase in locomotor activity persisted >9 hr (Figure 7A; n = 4 hM3Dq; n = 4 controls). These data provide behavioral evidence of neuronal activation by CNO in hM3Dq mice and demonstrate the long duration of CNO activity in hM3Dq animals. To assess the behavioral responses of hM3Dq mice to higher doses of CNO, we observed control and hM3Dq mice treated in parallel with saline or increasing doses of CNO. We found that treatment of hM3Dq mice with 0.5 mg/kg CNO reliably evoked limbic seizures of behavioral class 1 (Figure 4Ci); no behavioral evidence of seizure activity was detected after administration of"

Here we present a draft genomic sequence for the worm. The genome provides a global insight into the molecular architecture and host interaction of this complex metazoan pathogen, revealing that it can exploit host nutrients, neuroendocrine hormones and signalling pathways for growth, development and maturation. Having a complex nervous system and a well-developed sensory system, S. japonicum can accept stimulation of the corresponding ligands as a physiological response to different environments, such as fresh water or the tissues of its intermediate and mammalian hosts. Numerous proteases, including cercarial elastase, are implicated in mammalian skin penetration and haemoglobin degradation. The genomic information will serve as a valuable platform to facilitate development of new interventions for schistosomiasis control."
https://openalex.org/W2041852635,"Mass-spectrometry-based methods for relative proteome quantification have broadly affected life science research. However, important research directions, particularly those involving mathematical modelling and simulation of biological processes, also critically depend on absolutely quantitative data--that is, knowledge of the concentration of the expressed proteins as a function of cellular state. Until now, absolute protein concentration measurements of a considerable fraction of the proteome (73%) have only been derived from genetically altered Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, a technique that is not directly portable from yeast to other species. Here we present a mass-spectrometry-based strategy to determine the absolute quantity, that is, the average number of protein copies per cell in a cell population, for a large fraction of the proteome in genetically unperturbed cells. Applying the technology to the human pathogen Leptospira interrogans, a spirochete responsible for leptospirosis, we generated an absolute protein abundance scale for 83% of the mass-spectrometry-detectable proteome, from cells at different states. Taking advantage of the unique cellular dimensions of L. interrogans, we used cryo-electron tomography morphological measurements to verify, at the single-cell level, the average absolute abundance values of selected proteins determined by mass spectrometry on a population of cells. Because the strategy is relatively fast and applicable to any cell type, we expect that it will become a cornerstone of quantitative biology and systems biology."

However, it remains unknown whether receptor recycling influences AMPAR lateral diffusion and whether EZs are important for the expression of synaptic potentiation. Here, we demonstrate that the presence of both EZs and AMPAR recycling maintain a large pool of mobile AMPARs at synapses. In addition, we find that synaptic potentiation is accompanied by an accumulation and immobilization of AMPARs at synapses resulting from both their exocytosis and stabilization at the PSD. Displacement of EZs from the postsynaptic region impairs the expression of synaptic potentiation by blocking AMPAR recycling. Thus, receptor recycling is crucial for maintaining a mobile population of surface AMPARs that can be delivered to synapses for increases in synaptic strength.

At glutamatergic synapses, changes in the number of AMPARs tunes synaptic efficacy. Such modifications are dependent on both the availability of receptor binding sites inside the PSD and on the equilibrium between receptor influx and efflux at synapses (Newpher and Ehlers, 2008Newpher T.M.

These trafficking pathways were initially considered to be the main determinants of receptor density at synapses (Carroll et al., 1999aCarroll R.C. Beattie E.C. Xia H. Luscher C. Altschuler Y.

A few years ago, in addition to the intracellular trafficking, the lateral diffusion of glutamate receptors in the plasma membrane (Borgdorff and Choquet, 2002Borgdorff A.J. Choquet D.

Single-particle tracking of glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic membrane has demonstrated that AMPARs rapidly alternate between periods of Brownian-like lateral mobility, often at extrasynaptic sites, and periods of confinement or immobility, mostly at synapses. The reduced mobility of AMPARs at synapses is thought to occur as a result of interactions with PSD scaffold proteins. For example, stabilization of AMPARs at synaptic sites requires the interaction between stargazin-like transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs) and PSD-95 (Bats et al., 2007Bats C. Groc L. Choquet D. The interaction between Stargazin and PSD-95 regulates AMPA receptor surface trafficking.Neuron. 2007; 53: 719-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The dynamic interactions between glutamate receptors and PSD scaffold proteins results in mixed population of AMPAR mobility, with more than half of synaptic receptors able to exchange with the extrasynaptic membrane (Heine et al., 2008Heine M. Groc L. Frischknecht R. Beique J.C. Lounis B. Rumbaugh G. Huganir R.L. Cognet L. Choquet D. Surface mobility of postsynaptic AMPARs tunes synaptic transmission.Science. 2008; 320: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, Tardin et al., 2003Tardin C. Cognet L. Bats C. Lounis B. Choquet D. Direct imaging of lateral movements of AMPA receptors inside synapses.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4656-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Therefore, the fast exchange of mobile AMPARs at synapses is likely to be one major mechanism allowing for changes of synaptic strength (Heine et al., 2008Heine M. Groc L. Frischknecht R. Beique J.C. Lounis B. Rumbaugh G. Huganir R.L. Cognet L. Choquet D. Surface mobility of postsynaptic AMPARs tunes synaptic transmission.Science. 2008; 320: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). A direct link between receptor lateral mobility and synaptic potentiation has not been established yet. One hypothesis is that AMPAR lateral diffusion provides a pool of mobile receptors available in the vicinity of synapse to be recruited upon appropriate stimulus during synaptic potentiation. A variety of stimuli have been shown to modulate AMPAR lateral mobility over a wide dynamic range. For example, global glutamate application (Tardin et al., 2003Tardin C. Cognet L. Bats C. Lounis B. Choquet D. Direct imaging of lateral movements of AMPA receptors inside synapses.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4656-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), neuronal depolarization (Groc et al., 2004Groc L. Heine M. Cognet L. Brickley K. Stephenson F.A. Lounis B. Choquet D. Differential activity-dependent regulation of the lateral mobilities of AMPA and NMDA receptors.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), or long-term synapse-specific block of neuronal activity (Ehlers et al., 2007Ehlers M.D. Heine M. Groc L. Lee M.C. Choquet D. Diffusional trapping of GluR1 AMPA receptors by input-specific synaptic activity.Neuron. 2007; 54: 447-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) increase AMPAR movements inside synapses, while a local rise of intracellular calcium (Borgdorff and Choquet, 2002Borgdorff A.J. Choquet D. Regulation of AMPA receptor lateral movements.Nature. 2002; 417: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and high frequency neuronal activity (Heine et al., 2008Heine M. Groc L. Frischknecht R. Beique J.C. Lounis B. Rumbaugh G. Huganir R.L. Cognet L. Choquet D. Surface mobility of postsynaptic AMPARs tunes synaptic transmission.Science. 2008; 320: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) both rapidly immobilize AMPARs. Given that synaptic activity controls both the lateral diffusion and the intracellular trafficking of AMPARs, it is important to understand how these two processes are coupled to allow for the expression of synaptic plasticity. In addition, AMPAR endocytosis and exocytosis likely occur at membrane sites lateral to the PSD—either within or outside spines (Ashby et al., 2004Ashby M.C. De La Rue S.A. Ralph G.S. Uney J.

This suggests that receptor lateral diffusion to endocytic zones (EZs) and from exocytic sites will affect receptor accumulation at synapses (Choquet and Triller, 2003Choquet D. Triller A.

Chen J. Cao H. Oswald B.J. Hemar A. McNiven M.A. Dynamin 3 is a component of the postsynapse, where it interacts with mGluR5 and Homer.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the postsynaptic scaffold complex Homer/Shank (Lu et al., 2007Lu J. Helton T.D. Blanpied T.A. Racz B.

Importantly, disruption of this interaction leads to a displacement of EZs from the vicinity of the PSD, along with a decrease in the abundance of AMPARs at synapses. These findings suggest that spine-localized endocytosis may serve to capture AMPARs diffusing within the extrasynaptic membrane and allows their recycling to the plasma membrane for potential incorporation at synapses (Lu et al., 2007Lu J. Helton T.D. Blanpied T.A. Racz B. Newpher T.M. Weinberg R.J.

In the present study, we test the influence of EZs on the lateral diffusion of AMPARs and the expression of synaptic potentiation. Using single-particle tracking and high-resolution real-time fluorescence microscopy, we find that both EZs and local receptor recycling are required to maintain a mobile pool of AMPARs at synapses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this proximate pool of mobile AMPARs is essential for controlling the mobility and accumulation of synaptic receptors during synaptic potentiation. We first characterized the lateral mobility of surface GluA1-containing AMPARs at both synapses and EZs by combining single-particle tracking and live-cell fluorescence imaging. Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with Dyn3, along with Homer::GFP and clathrin::DsRed (Figure 1A). Homer and clathrin were used to monitor synapses and clathrin-rich zones, respectively. Importantly, overexpression of these fluorescently labeled proteins did not result in any detectable structural or functional effects on synapses, as reported in Figure S1 and Supplemental Data. In addition, overexpression of Dyn3 did not alter either synapse density (Figure S1E) or GluA1 synaptic accumulation (Figure S1F). Consistent with previous studies (Blanpied et al., 2002Blanpied T.A.

To unequivocally define synapses and EZs, we performed object segmentation by wavelet transform (see Experimental Procedures and Racine et al., 2007Racine V. Sachse M. Salamero J. Fraisier V.

Microsc. 2007; 225: 214-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A, lower inset) on fluorescence images, thus overcoming the possible bias of selecting thresholds. Consequently, AMPAR localization was distinguished as being either within synapses or clathrin puncta. To monitor AMPAR mobility at synapses and clathrin-rich zones, surface AMPARs were tagged with quantum dots (QDs) and imaged over 60 s time periods. QD trajectories reconstructed with ∼40 nm accuracy (see Experimental Procedures) revealed that GluA1-QD complexes alternate between periods of high and reduced mobility (Figures 1B and 1C).

The mean square displacement (MSD, a measure of the surface explored by the receptors versus time) of AMPARs at extrasynaptic zones varied quasilinearly with time, indicative of Brownian diffusion (Figure 1B, upper right panel). In contrast, the MSD function of synaptic receptors saturated, indicating that receptors were moving in a confined space (Figure 1B, upper right panel).

Direct imaging of lateral movements of AMPA receptors inside synapses.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4656-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), we observed that the percentage of immobile receptors at synapses was much higher than at extrasynaptic compartments (Figure 1B, lower left panel). In addition, the instantaneous diffusion coefficients of mobile receptors were significantly lower at synapses relative to extrasynaptic sites (Figure 1B, lower middle panel). Noteworthy, a large proportion of mobile synaptic receptors (80% ± 5%) exchanged between synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments during the imaging period (1 min), indicating that most receptors were only transiently stabilized at synapses on the minute time scale, with a shorter dwell time at synapses (Figure 1B, lower right panel) compared to extrasynaptic sites. We then analyzed the dynamics of surface AMPARs on clathrin-rich zones. About half of clathrin puncta (55%) were positioned in close proximity to the PSD (hereafter referred to as EZs). The remaining population of clathrin puncta was distributed along dendritic shafts, likely representing non-synapse-associated clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), as well as endosomal and trans-golgi network (TGN) organelles containing clathrin. Analogous to the observed receptor mobility at synapses, AMPAR lateral mobility at clathrin was reduced compared to extra-clathrin zones (Figure 1C and Movie S2). At clathrin puncta, the percentage of immobile receptors was doubled compared to extra-clathrin sites, and the median diffusion coefficient of mobile receptors was smaller than that outside clathrin (Figure 1C, lower panels). The overall dynamic behavior of AMPARs at clathrin puncta was highly confined, as shown by the strongly curved MSD function (Figure 1C, upper right panel). Interestingly, only half of the receptors found at clathrin-rich zones were permanently stabilized, while 48% ± 9% exchanged location between clathrin puncta and extra-clathrin areas with a mean dwell time of 2.9 ± 0.3 s on clathrin and 4.1 ± 0.6 s outside (Figure 1C, lower right panel). Importantly, GluA1 coupled to antibody-QD complexes could still undergo clathrin-mediated endocytosis, indicating that the observed GluA1-QD complexes were present at the cell surface and that the presence of QDs did not impair the trafficking functions of clathrin-rich zones (Figure S2 and Supplemental Data). A first analysis of the influence of synapse-EZ proximity on receptor dynamics revealed that there is a selective negative correlation between GluA1 mobility at synapses and the distance between synapses and clathrin-rich zones (Supplemental Data and Figure S3). GluA1 is more mobile at synapses next to an EZ than at synapses devoid of an EZ. In order to further investigate the role of EZ proximity to the PSD on AMPAR mobility, we used a point mutant of Dyn3 unable to bind Homer1 (Dyn3-PL), which was previously shown to displace EZs from the PSD and impair receptor recycling (Lu et al., 2007Lu J. Helton T.D. Blanpied T.A. Racz B. Newpher T.M. Weinberg R.J. Ehlers M.D. Postsynaptic positioning of endocytic zones and AMPA receptor cycling by physical coupling of dynamin-3 to Homer.Neuron. 2007; 55: 874-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Similar to previous experiments (Lu et al., 2007Lu J. Helton T.D. Blanpied T.A. Racz B. Newpher T.M. Weinberg R.J. Ehlers M.D. Postsynaptic positioning of endocytic zones and AMPA receptor cycling by physical coupling of dynamin-3 to Homer.Neuron. 2007; 55: 874-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), overexpression of Dyn3-PL reduced the percentage of PSDs associated with an EZ (Figure 2A) and reduced AMPAR accumulation at synapses. This effect was selective to synapses, as the number of synaptic AMPARs in Dyn3-PL-expressing neurons was not even half of that measured in Dyn3-Wt neurons, although the total surface expression was comparable under the two conditions (Figure 2B). Accordingly, expression of Dyn3-PL did not increase receptor number, either on clathrin puncta or at domains simultaneously excluding clathrin and synaptic staining (GluA1 fluorescence intensity/pixel: clath: Dyn3-Wt = 20.6 ± 1.2 a.u.; Dyn3-PL = 24.0 ± 1.0 a.u, p > 0.05; extra: Dyn3-Wt = 16.5 ± 1.2 a.u.; Dyn3-PL = 21.3 ± 1.4 a.u, p > 0.05, Student's t test, n = 15 neurons in each condition, data not shown). Interestingly, we observed that in Dyn3-PL neurons GluA1 mobility both at synapses and at clathrin-rich zones was not influenced by synapse-clathrin distance (Figures S4A and S4B and Supplemental Data). In the presence of a close EZ, wild-type synapses contain both mobile and immobile receptors (Figure 1). In order to test whether the presence of EZs influences AMPAR lateral diffusion at synapses, we uncoupled EZs from the PSD. Indeed, displacement of EZs, and the consequent impairment of receptor recycling with Dyn3-PL overexpression (Lu et al., 2007Lu J. Helton T.D. Blanpied T.A. Racz B. Newpher T.M. Weinberg R.J. Ehlers M.D. Postsynaptic positioning of endocytic zones and AMPA receptor cycling by physical coupling of dynamin-3 to Homer.Neuron. 2007; 55: 874-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), highly reduced the mobility of synaptic GluA1 compared to WT conditions (Figure 2C and Movie S4). Compared to Dyn3-Wt, in Dyn3-PL neurons the distribution of receptor diffusion coefficients at synapses was shifted to lower values (Figure 2D), and the immobile fraction of synaptic receptors doubled (Figure 2E). Accordingly, the mean MSD of synaptic trajectories in Dyn3-PL neurons reached a lower plateau compared to that in Dyn3-Wt neurons (Figure 2D, middle panel), revealing strong receptor confinement. Importantly, the fraction of immobile receptors is relative to the total number of receptors tracked in each condition. Taking into account that synapses in Dyn3-Wt neurons exhibit approximately twice the number of receptors as Dyn3-PL synapses (see Figure 2B), this suggests that the absolute number of immobile receptors in Dyn3-Wt and Dyn3-PL neurons is similar; therefore, the Dyn3-PL mutant had a specific reduction in the population of mobile synaptic AMPARs. In addition, Dyn3-PL neurons exhibited a lower rate of receptor exchange between synaptic and extrasynaptic sites (66% ± 6% versus 79% ± 7% exchanging receptors at synapses in Dyn3-PL and Dyn3-Wt, respectively) and a longer AMPAR dwell time at synapses (Figure 2E, right panel). Importantly, knockdown of endogenous Dyn3 by RNA interference had comparable effects to Dyn3-PL overexpression, thus indicating that endogenous Dyn3 is required for maintaining a mobile pool of receptors at synapses (Figure S5 and Supplemental Data). AMPAR lateral mobility at clathrin puncta and in membrane domains simultaneously excluding Homer::EGFP and clathrin::DsRed fluorescence was not significantly affected by the overexpression of any Dyn3 mutant (Figures S4C–S4G), as confirmed by the comparable MSD functions in Dyn3-Wt and Dyn3-PL expressing neurons (Figure 2D, right panel). Altogether, we conclude that removing EZs from the vicinity of the PSD selectively affects AMPAR mobility at synapses by reducing the mobile pool of re"

https://openalex.org/W1978597334,"Studies over the past decade have enunciated silent synapses as prominent cellular substrates for synaptic plasticity in the developing brain. However, little is known about whether silent synapses can be generated postdevelopmentally. Here, we demonstrate that highly salient in vivo experience, such as exposure to cocaine, generates silent synapses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell, a key brain region mediating addiction-related learning and memory. Furthermore, this cocaine-induced generation of silent synapses is mediated by membrane insertions of new, NR2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs). These results provide evidence that silent synapses can be generated de novo by in vivo experience and thus may act as highly efficient neural substrates for the subsequent experience-dependent synaptic plasticity underlying extremely long-lasting memory."

https://openalex.org/W1972612572,"Autophagy has been emerging as a novel cytoprotective mechanism to increase tumor cell survival under conditions of metabolic stress and hypoxia as well as to escape chemotherapy-induced cell death. To elucidate whether autophagy might also protect cancer cells from the growth inhibitory effects of targeted therapies, we evaluated the autophagic status of preclinical breast cancer models exhibiting auto-acquired resistance to the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Tzb). We first examined the basal autophagic levels in Tzb-naive SKBR3 cells and in two pools of Tzb-conditioned SKBR3 cells (TzbR), which optimally grow in the presence of Tzb doses as high as 200 microg/ml Tzb. Fluorescence microscopic analyses revealed that the number of punctate LC3 structures -a hallmark of autophagy- was drastically higher in Tzb-refractory cells than in Tzb-sensitive SKBR3 parental cells. Immunoblotting analyses confirmed that the lipidation product of the autophagic conversion of LC3 was accumulated to high levels in TzbR cells. High levels of the LC3 lipidated form in Tzb-refractory cells were accompanied by decreased p62/sequestosome-1 protein expression, a phenomenon characterizing the occurrence of increased autophagic flux. Moreover, increased autophagy was actively used to survive Tzb therapy as TzbR pools were exquisitely sensitive to chemical inhibitors of autophagosomal formation/function. Knockdown of LC3 expression via siRNA similarly resulted in reduced TzbR cell proliferation and supra-additively interacted with Tzb to re-sensitize TzbR cells. Sub-groups of Tzb-naive SKBR3 parental cells accumulated LC3 punctate structures and decreased p62 expression after treatment with high-dose Tzb, likely promoting their own resistance. This is the first report showing that HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells chronically exposed to Tzb exhibit a bona fide up-regulation of the autophagic activity that efficiently works to protect breast cancer cells from the growth-inhibitory effects of Tzb. Therapeutic targeting autophagosome formation/function might represent a novel molecular avenue to reduce the emergence of Tzb resistance in HER2-dependent breast carcinomas."

The conserved polarity protein Par6alpha localizes to the centrosome and coordinates forward movement of the centrosome and soma in migrating neurons. The cytoskeletal components that produce this unique form of cell polarity and their relationship to polarity signaling cascades are unknown. We show that F-actin and Myosin II motors are enriched in the neuronal leading process and that Myosin II activity is necessary for leading process actin dynamics. Inhibition of Myosin II decreased the speed of centrosome and somal movement, whereas Myosin II activation increased coordinated movement. Ectopic expression or silencing of Par6alpha inhibited Myosin II motors by decreasing Myosin light-chain phosphorylation. These findings suggest leading-process Myosin II may function to ""pull"" the centrosome and soma forward during glial-guided migration by a mechanism involving the conserved polarity protein Par6alpha."

We mapped and investigated observed historic and projected future changes in winter chill in California, quantified with two different chilling models (Chilling Hours, Dynamic Model).Based on hourly and daily temperature records, winter chill was modeled for two past temperature scenarios (1950 and 2000), and 18 future scenarios (average conditions during 2041-2060 and 2080-2099 under each of the B1, A1B and A2 IPCC greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, for the CSIRO-MK3, HadCM3 and MIROC climate models). For each scenario, 100 replications of the yearly temperature record were produced, using a stochastic weather generator. We then introduced and mapped a novel climatic statistic, ""safe winter chill"", the 10% quantile of the resulting chilling distributions. This metric can be interpreted as the amount of chilling that growers can safely expect under each scenario. Winter chill declined substantially for all emissions scenarios, with the area of safe winter chill for many tree species or cultivars decreasing 50-75% by mid-21st century, and 90-100% by late century.Both chilling models consistently projected climatic conditions by the middle to end of the 21st century that will no longer support some of the main tree crops currently grown in California, with the Chilling Hours Model projecting greater changes than the Dynamic Model. The tree crop industry in California will likely need to develop agricultural adaptation measures (e.g. low-chill varieties and dormancy-breaking chemicals) to cope with these projected changes. For some crops, production might no longer be possible."

Delayed RG differentiation in Fgf10 mutants occurs selectively in rostral cortex, paralleled by an extended period of symmetric NC divisions increasing progenitor number, coupled with delayed and initially diminished production of neurons and BPs.

Radial glia (RG), the progenitors of cortical neurons and basal progenitors (BPs), differentiate from neuroepithelial cells (NCs) with stem cell properties.

Thus, transient Fgf10 expression regulates timely differentiation of RG, and through this function, determines both length of the early progenitor expansion phase and onset of neurogenesis and ultimately the number of progenitors and neurons fated to specific cortical areas. Early in corticogenesis, cortical progenitors referred to as neuroepithelial cells (NCs) have stem cell properties and expand their numbers within the ventricular zone (VZ) by symmetric cell division that produces two like progenitors. Later, NCs differentiate into a mature progenitor termed a radial glia (RG) that exhibits asymmetric division to produce a pair of unlike cells comprised of an RG to maintain the proliferative pool and either a deep layer cortical neuron or a basal progenitor (i.e., intermediate progenitor) that establishes the subventricular zone (SVZ) and later produces superficial layer cortical neurons (Gotz and Huttner, 2005Gotz M. Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanisms that mediate this critical transition period that bridges the early expansion phase characterized by symmetric division of NCs with the later neurogenic phase characterized by asymmetric division of RG. However, the timing of the transition from NE to RG has critical implications for corticogenesis, because models predict that minor changes in the proportion of progenitors exhibiting one or the other division mode at early stages result in substantial changes in the number of progenitors and ultimately cortical size (Caviness et al., 1995Caviness Jr., V.S.

These predictions are supported by the analysis of mice genetically modified to express a stabilized form of β-catenin, which regulates the mode of cell division and leads to an increase in symmetric divisions producing progenitors (Chenn and Walsh, 2002Chenn A. Walsh C.A. Regulation of cerebral cortical size by control of cell cycle exit in neural precursors.Science. 2002; 297: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar) and mice with a deletion of either caspase-9 or Cpp32, which reduces apoptotic cell death among progenitors (Chenn and Walsh, 2002Chenn A.

Each of these genetic manipulations results in an increase in cortical progenitors and, presumably as a result, an increase in cortical size. Most, if not all, neurons generated in the cortical VZ are progeny of BLBP-positive RG that differentiate from BLBP-negative NCs (Anthony et al., 2004Anthony T.E. Klein C. Fishell G. Heintz N. Radial glia serve as neuronal progenitors in all regions of the central nervous system.Neuron. 2004; 41: 881-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Although NCs may produce a small proportion of neurons (Gotz and Huttner, 2005Gotz M. Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar), within the cortex they are primarily cortical stem cells that divide symmetrically to produce two like cells, expanding the progenitor pool before differentiating into BLBP-positive RG. Therefore, the differentiation of NCs into RG is a critical step in determining whether progenitors retain a symmetric mode of cell division that serves to expand progenitor pools or acquire an asymmetric mode to populate the cortex. Notch signaling is involved in the transition of NCs into RG. For example, Notch1 promotes RG identity when an activated form is overexpressed before the onset of neurogenesis (Gaiano et al., 2000Gaiano N. Nye J.S. Fishell G. Radial glial identity is promoted by Notch1 signaling in the murine forebrain.Neuron. 2000; 26: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) and BLBP expression is diminished in mice deficient for both Notch1 and Notch3 in the forebrain (Anthony et al., 2005Anthony T.E. Mason H.A. Gridley T. Fishell G. Heintz N. Brain lipid-binding protein is a direct target of Notch signaling in radial glial cells.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, Notch signaling is not the only determinant for RG differentiation because BLBP expression is not entirely abolished in Notch1 and Notch3 double-knockout mice. Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling is also implicated in the differentiation of NCs into RG. For example, in vivo studies based upon expressing a constitutively active form of the Fgf receptor, Fgfr2, indicate that its activation in NCs promotes their differentiation into RG (Yoon et al., 2004Yoon K. Nery S. Rutlin M.L. Radtke F. Fishell G. Gaiano N. Fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling promotes radial glial identity and interacts with Notch1 signaling in telencephalic progenitors.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9497-9506Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In contrast, though, in vitro studies of dissociated cortical cell cultures indicate that Fgfr1 and Fgfr3 promote the proliferation of cortical NCs, a function distinct from differentiation (Maric et al., 2007Maric D. Fiorio Pla A. Chang Y.H. Barker J.L. Self-renewing and differentiating properties of cortical neural stem cells are selectively regulated by basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling via specific FGF receptors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1836-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings indicate that the different Fgf receptors expressed by cortical NCs have distinct effects on their proliferation and differentiation. Fgf receptors expressed by cortical NCs are activated by unique subsets of Fgfs. Several Fgfs influence corticogenesis, but only Fgf2 has been reported to be expressed in the cortical VZ. Fgf2 is expressed by progenitors throughout the cortical VZ, and deletion of it results in diminished proliferation of progenitors (Vaccarino et al., 1999Vaccarino F.M. Schwartz M.L. Raballo R. Nilsen J. Rhee J. Zhou M. Doetschman T. Coffin J.D. Wyland J.J. Hung Y.T. Changes in cerebral cortex size are governed by fibroblast growth factor during embryogenesis.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Fgf8, Fgf17, and Fgf18 are expressed in the anterior neural ridge (ANR)/commissural plate (CoP) positioned at the anterior midline of the nascent neocortex. Fgf2 and Fgf8, which have been most studied, preferentially function through Fgfr1, Fgfr2c, and Fgfr3 and contribute to the proliferation and survival of cortical progenitors (Gutin et al., 2006Gutin G. Fernandes M. Palazzolo L. Paek H. Yu K. Ornitz D.M. McConnell S.K. Hebert J.M. FGF signalling generates ventral telencephalic cells independently of SHH.Development. 2006; 133: 2937-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Maric et al., 2007Maric D. Fiorio Pla A.

Receptor specificity of the fibroblast growth factor family.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Fgf15, which has a very dynamic expression pattern in forebrain, indirectly influences proliferation in cortex through its regulation of Fgf8 in the CoP (Borello et al., 2008Borello U. Cobos I. Long J.E. Murre C. Rubenstein J.L. FGF15 promotes neurogenesis and opposes FGF8 function during neocortical development.Neural Develop. 2008; 3: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Finally, Fgf7 is expressed in the antihem, a putative patterning center positioned along the rostral-caudal cortical axis at the border between dorsal telencephalon (dTel) and ventral telencephalon; Fgf7 preferentially binds Fgfr2b, but to date it has not been assigned a function in corticogenesis (Assimacopoulos et al., 2003Assimacopoulos S. Grove E.A. Ragsdale C.W. Identification of a Pax6-dependent epidermal growth factor family signaling source at the lateral edge of the embryonic cerebral cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6399-6403PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, progress has been made on defining Fgfs responsible for regulating proliferation of cortical progenitors, but Fgfs responsible for promoting the differentiation of NCs into RG remain vague. Here, we show that Fgf10, a high-affinity ligand for Fgfr2b, controls RG differentiation in the cortical VZ and through its regulation of this process has critical consequences for corticogenesis and patterning. The present study is based upon our analysis of expression patterns of each of the 22 members of the Fgf family, which reveal that Fgf10 has a particularly novel expression pattern suggestive of a prominent and unique role in corticogenesis. We find that Fgf10 is transiently expressed by cortical progenitors during the transition period coincident with the differentiation of NCs into RG. These findings prompted us to investigate the role of Fgf10 in this differentiation process and the consequences of altering Fgf10 expression on corticogenesis. We find that Fgf10 drives the timely differentiation of NCs into RG and through this function determines both the length of the expansion phase of NCs and the onset of neurogenesis. The generation of neurons and BPs, both the progeny of RG, is similarly effected by deletion of Fgf10, with each showing an initial delay and decrease in production followed by an increase. Thus, our findings demonstrate that through its regulation of RG differentiation, Fgf10 determines the size of progenitor pools both within the VZ and the SVZ, with significant consequences for neuronal production, and ultimately the size of the cortex as well as its laminar and area patterning. We analyzed Fgf expression in embryonic dTel and found that Fgf10 has a unique expression pattern that suggests a role in corticogenesis (Figure 1). Previous studies have shown that Fgf10 is expressed in early forebrain, with strong expression in infundibulum in ventral hypothalamus (Bachler and Neubuser, 2001Bachler M. Neubuser A. Expression of members of the Fgf family and their receptors during midfacial development.Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, Treier et al., 2001Treier M. O'Connell S. Gleiberman A. Price J. Szeto D.P. Burgess R. Chuang P.T. McMahon A.P. Rosenfeld M.G. Hedgehog signaling is required for pituitary gland development.Development. 2001; 128: 377-386PubMed Google Scholar), but expression in dTel has not been reported. Therefore, we analyzed in detail Fgf10 expression using in situ hybridization on sections of E9.5 to E16.5 telencephalon (Figure 1 and data not shown). Fgf10 expression is first detected at E9.5 but is weak and is limited to the anterior midline of dTel (Figures 1A and 1A′). At E10.0 to E10.5, Fgf10 expression becomes evident at the apical side of the entire VZ of dTel (Figures 1B, 1C, 1B′ and 1C′) and is sustained through E11.5 (Figures 1D and 1D′), after which it decreases in intensity, becoming undetectable by E13.5 (Figures 1E and 1E′). In summary, Fgf10 is transiently expressed in cortical progenitors at the apical side of the VZ during the transition period when NCs differentiate into RG, signaling the onset of the neurogenic phase. The restricted localization of Fgf10 transcripts suggest that Fgf10 is expressed by NCs at a specific stage of differentiation, most likely M phase. Our findings indicate that Fgf10 is expressed in progenitors during the period that they differentiate from NCs into RG, which go on to produce neurons and BPs, and subsequently glia (Anthony et al., 2004Anthony T.E.

Neuronal or glial progeny: regional differences in radial glia fate.Neuron. 2003; 37: 751-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). To address whether Fgf10 influences the differentiation of RG from NCs, we analyzed the expression of the RG-specific markers BLBP and GLAST in the cortex of Fgf10−/− mice compared to wild-type (WT) using specific antibodies (Hartfuss et al., 2001Hartfuss E. Galli R. Heins N. Gotz M. Characterization of CNS precursor subtypes and radial glia.Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Previous studies have reported that BLBP expression can be detected using immunostaining at E12.5 (Anthony et al., 2004Anthony T.E. Klein C. Fishell G. Heintz N. Radial glia serve as neuronal progenitors in all regions of the central nervous system.Neuron. 2004; 41: 881-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed mice between E10.5 and E13.5. We find no detectable staining in the cortex of either WT or Fgf10−/− mice at E10.5 (data not shown). However, by E11.5, we readily detect BLBP in WT mice with the strongest immunostaining in ventrolateral and dorsomedial cortex (Figure 2A) and mild expression in dorsolateral cortex (Figures 2A and 2D). In WT, BLBP immunostaining is stronger and more extensive in the cortex at E12.5 (Figures 2B and 2E). In contrast, BLBP immunostaining in the cortex of Fgf10−/− mice is deficient relative to WT (compare Figures 2A, 2B, 2D, and 2E to Figures 2A′, 2B′, 2D′, and 2E′). By E13.5, BLBP immunostaining is found throughout the cortical VZ in WT, and in contrast to earlier stages, immunostaining for BLBP in Fgf10−/− cortex at E13.5 is indistinguishable from WT (compare Figures 2C and 2C′). Immunostaining for GLAST corroborates our findings with BLBP. We find that GLAST immunostaining is more modest than that for BLBP during the transition period and is most detectable in lateral cortex (Figure 2F). Like BLBP, GLAST is also downregulated in Fgf10−/− cortex (Figure 2F′). We conclude from these findings that Fgf10 is required for the differentiation of NCs into RG. In addition to the induction of RG markers, we also examined within the VZ the expression of Occludin, a tight-junction marker localized to the surfaces of NCs, particularly their apical surface near the lumen of the lateral ventricle, that is characteristically downregulated as they differentiate into RG (Aaku-Saraste et al., 1996Aaku-Saraste E. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. Loss of Occludin and functional tight junctions, but not ZO-1, during neural tube closure–remodeling of the neuroepithelium prior to neurogenesis.Dev.

At E11.5, we observe strong expression of Occludin at the apical surface of the VZ in the cortex of both WT and Fgf10−/− mice (see Figures S1A and S1A′ available online). This expression is strongly diminished by E12.5 in WT cortex (Figures S1B and S1C), whereas in contrast, in Fgf10−/− mice it is diminished in caudal cortex at E12.5 but is aberrantly sustained in rostral cortex (Figures S1B′, S1C′, and S1E). By E13.5, Occludin expression is downregulated throughout the cortex of Fgf10−/− mice and resembles WT (Figures S1D and S1D′). Thus, downregulation of the expression of the tight-junction marker Occludin that occurs throughout WT cortex between E11.5 and E12.5 is delayed selectively in rostral cortex of Fgf10−/− mice, which correlates both spatially and temporally with the delay in upregulation of the expression of the RG markers BLBP and GLAST. These complementary sets of findings indicate that the deletion of Fgf10 delays the differentiation of RG from NCs in vivo. To test whether Fgf10 is sufficient to promote RG differentiation, we performed gain-of-function experiments by overexpressing Fgf10 using in utero electroporation. An expression vector with Fgf10 under the control of the CAG promoter was coelectroporated at E11.5 with an EGFP expression vector as a reporter to reveal the electroporation domains in the brains analyzed at E12.5. BLBP immunostaining in control vector-electroporated domains is identical to unelectroporated brains (n = 3; Figures 3B, 3C, 3E, and 3F and data not shown). In contrast, when Fgf10 is overexpressed, we find a higher level of BLBP immunostaining coincident with the ectopic domain of Fgf10 expression (n = 3; Figures 3B′, 3C′, 3E′, and 3F′). In summary, our gain-of-function analyses indicate that Fgf10 is sufficient to promote the differentiation of NCs into RG, whereas our loss-of-function analyses show that Fgf10 is required for the appropriate timing of this differentiation event. As described above, Fgf10 expression is first detected in rostral cortex, and then expands caudally (Figures 1A and 1B). Therefore, we speculated that the diminished expression of BLBP that we observe in Fgf10−/− cortex compared to WT may also be graded, resulting in a more pronounced effect on RG differentiation in rostral cortex. To address this issue, we compared the expression of BLBP across the rostral-caudal cortical axis in Fgf10−/− mice to their WT littermates at E11.5. Qualitatively, we find that BLBP immunostaining is substantially diminished rostrally in mutant cortex compared to WT, but that caudally the staining is similar (Figures 4A and 4A′). This impression is corroborated by quantification of fluorescence intensity of the BLBP immunostaining at five positions along rostral-caudal cortical axis (Figure 4B). Thus, BLBP expression is significantly diminished in rostral cortex of Fgf10 mutants compared to WT. To extend these findings, we performed two additional quantitative analyses of cortical BLBP expression in WT and Fgf10−/− littermates. First, we measured overall intensity of the fluorescence immunostaining at a mid-rostral level and find that relative to WT, the staining in Fgf10−/− cortex is diminished by 82% at E11.5 and 57% at E12.5, whereas the staining intensity is comparable in WT and mutant cortex at E13.5 (Figure 4C; n = 4). To address this issue at a cellular level, we dissociated, plated, and immediately immunostained cells from the rostral half of the cortex of WT and Fgf10−/− littermates at E11.5, E12.5, and E13.5 (Figures 4D–4G). At E11.5, 30% of WT cortical cells are BLBP positive, whereas only 10% of cells from Fgf10−/− cortex are BLBP positive (Figure 4G). At E12.5, 49% of cells are BLBP positive in WT cortex, compared to only 28% in Fgf10−/− cortex (Figure 4G). By E13.5, 48% of WT cortical cells are BLBP positive, compared to 52% in Fgf10−/− cortex (Figure 4G). These data show a 67% decrease in the percentage of cells that are BLBP positive in Fgf10−/− cortex compared to WT at E11.5, and a 42% decrease at E12.5. To restate these data, in the presence of Fgf10, we observe a 300% increase in VZ cells that are BLBP positive at E11.5 and a 175% increase at E12.5. By E13.5, BLBP immunostaining is virtually indistinguishable between WT and Fgf10−/− cortex. These quantitative data indicate that in WT cortex, BLBP expression progressively increases between E11.5 and E13.5, both in overall intensity and in the proportion of VZ cells expressing BLBP, overlapping with the transient expression of Fgf10. However, this progressive increase in BLBP immunostaining is delayed and transiently diminished in rostral cortex of Fgf10−/− mutants, but that by E13.5, when Fgf10 expression is normally downregulated in WT cortex, BLBP staining in Fgf10−/− cortex has increased and is comparable to WT. Thus, Fgf10 expression by NCs is required for their timely differentiation into RG in rostral cortex during the transition period. Our findings indicate that Fgf10 controls the differentiation of NCs into RG and that in the absence of Fgf10, this differentiation process is delayed. We predicted a similar delay in the production of the earliest generated neurons and BPs by differentiated RG. To address this issue, we used specific markers to compare WT and Fgf10−/− mice beginning at E10.5, when preplate neurons are first generated, through to E14.5, encompassing the period when neurons that will form layers 5 and 6 of the cortical plate are generated. Cortical preplate neurons, which arise from BLBP-positive RG (Anthony et al., 2004Anthony T.E. Klein C. Fishell G. Heintz N. Radial glia serve as neuronal progenitors in all regions of the central nervous system.Neuron. 2004; 41: 881-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), are generated between E10.5 and E12.5 and are uniquely marked by the T-box transcription factor, Tbr1 (Hevner et al., 2001Hevner R.F.

Tbr1 regulates differentiation of the preplate and layer 6.Neuron. 2001; 29: 353-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). In E10.5 WT mice, a low density of Tbr1-positive neurons forms the nascent preplate just beneath the pial surface (Figure 5A). In Fgf10−/− mice, we find a significant reduction in the number of Tbr1-positive neurons in rostral cortex compared to WT littermates (compare Figure 5A to 5A′, and 5G). In contrast to WT, sections through rostral cortex of Fgf10−/− mice have at most only one Tbr1-positive neuron, many have none. We continue to observe a significant reduction in the number of Tbr1-positive neurons at E11.5, with 83% fewer in the rostral cortex of Fgf10−/− mice compared to WT littermates (Figures 5B, 5B′, and 5G; n = 4). The difference in the numbers of Tbr1-positive neurons found in Fgf10−/− cortex compared to WT is less significant at E12.5, the last day of significant production of preplate neurons in WT, following which RG generate cortical plate neurons. This trend continues over the next 2 days with the Tbr1-positive cortical plate of the Fgf10−/− mice coming to more closely resemble that in WT (Figures 5D–5E′ and 5G). We confirmed the reduction in numbers of preplate neurons at E12.5 by TuJ1 immunostaining, which labels type III beta tubulin characteristic of all postmitotic neurons and reveals a significant reduction in neuronal density in Fgf10−/− cortex (Figures 5F and 5F′). In conclusion, in Fgf10−/− mice, cortical neurogenesis lags behind WT by about a day and a half to two days, a delay similar to that observed in the differentiation of their RG progenitors. We also analyzed the generation of BPs, which arise from RG and form the SVZ, a second germinal zone outside of the VZ that produces superficial layer neurons. For this analysis, we performed immunostaining from E11.5 through E17.5 using a marker specific for BPs, the T-box transcription factor Tbr2 (Englund et al., 2005Englund C. Fink A. Lau C. Pham D. Daza R.A. Bulfone A. Kowalczyk T. Hevner R.F. Pax6, Tbr2, and Tbr1 are expressed sequentially by radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, and postmitotic neurons in developing neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar; Figure S2). We find a significant reduction of BPs in Fgf10−/− cortex compared to WT littermates at E11.5 and E12.5 (Figures S2A, S2B, S2A′, and S2B′; n = 4, 42% reduction for E11.5, 40% for E12.5). In contrast, at E13.5, the number of BPs is the same in Fgf10−/− cortex as in WT, but between E14.5 and E17.5, we find a trend toward an increase in BPs, with the difference being statistically significant at E15.5 (Figure S2H). These findings indicate that the delay in the differentiation of NCs into RG within the cortical VZ is accompanied not only by a delayed onset of the production of neurons, but also by a diminished production of BPs. However, as for neurons, at later stages, production of BPs is increased in Fgf10−/− cortex compared to WT. Our findings above show that the differentiation of NCs into RG in the VZ is delayed in rostral Fgf10−/− cortex and is paralleled by a delay and reduction in both early neurogenesis and the initial production of BPs. We carried out additional analyses to assess potential implications of these findings. We first addressed whether the delay in RG differentiation and/or the Fgf10 deficiency results in a defect that alters cell cycle kinetics or survival of progenitors in the cortical VZ. Our analyses though indicate that the length of the cell cycle measured with the thymidine analog, BrdU, and apoptotic cell death revealed by immunostaining for activated Caspase-3, are indistinguishable between WT and Fgf10−/− mice (Figure S3). To address whether the delay in RG differentiation may affect the mode of cell division of progenitors, we first examined the ratio of cells that exit or reenter the cell cycle at early stages of neurogenesis. We exposed proliferating cells to a pulse of BrdU at E11.5 and 24 hr later fixed the mice and immunostained for Ki67 to mark actively proliferating cells. Cells that are singly labeled with BrdU have exited the cell cycle over the 24 hr period to become preplate neurons (Takahashi et al., 1999Takahashi T. Goto T. Miyama S. Nowakowski R.S. Caviness Jr., V.S. Sequence of neuron origin and neocortical laminar fate: relation to cell cycle of origin in the developing murine cerebral wall.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10357-10371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas those that are double labeled with BrdU and Ki67 are proliferating progenitors. We find that in rostral cortex, 66% fewer progenitors exit the cell cycle by E12.5 in Fgf10−/− mice compared to WT (Figures 6A, 6A′, and 6B; n = 4, p < 0.05). This result indicates that in Fgf10−/− cortex, at early stages of cortical neurogenesis, progenitors are more likely to remain in the proliferative mode than exit it and become neurons. This finding provides a mechanism to account for the reduced number of preplate neurons in Fgf10−/− cortex compared to WT and is consistent with the delayed differentiation of NCs into RG in Fgf10−/− cortex and the accompanying switch from symmetric to asymmetric division marking the onset of the neurogenic phase. Our findings show that in Fgf10−/− cortex, progenitors remain in a mode of symmetric division for an extended period, resulting in the production of two progenitors when they divide, and exhibit a delay in becoming neurogenic and exhibiting asymmetric division. To address this issue, we examined the mode of cell division by following in vitro the fate of rostral cortical progenitors that were dissociated from E12.5 cortex and plated at clonal density; isolated individual cells were verified and followed over time (Figures 6C and 6D; Qian et al., 1998Qian X.

Txnip is the only α-arrestin known to bind thioredoxin, and it is not known whether the metabolic effects of Txnip are related to its ability to bind thioredoxin or related to conserved α-arrestin function. Here we show that wild type Txnip and Txnip C247S, a Txnip mutant that does not bind thioredoxin in vitro, both inhibit glucose uptake in mature adipocytes and in primary skin fibroblasts. Furthermore, we show that Txnip C247S does not bind thioredoxin in cells, using thiol alkylation to trap the Txnip-thioredoxin complex. Because Txnip function was independent of thioredoxin binding, we tested whether inhibition of glucose uptake was conserved in the related α-arrestins Arrdc4 and Arrdc3. Both Txnip and Arrdc4 inhibited glucose uptake and lactate output, while Arrdc3 had no effect. Structure-function analysis indicated that Txnip and Arrdc4 inhibit glucose uptake independent of the C-terminal WW-domain binding motifs, recently identified as important in yeast α-arrestins. Instead, regulation of glucose uptake was intrinsic to the arrestin domains themselves. These data demonstrate that Txnip regulates cellular metabolism independent of its binding to thioredoxin and reveal the arrestin domains as crucial structural elements in metabolic functions of α-arrestin proteins.

We have proposed that Txnip inhibits thioredoxin by forming a mixed disulfide with thioredoxin at its catalytic active site cysteines in a disulfide exchange reaction (13Patwari P. Higgins L.J.

However, it is not known how Txnip metabolic functions relate to its ability to bind thioredoxin. thioredoxin-interacting protein phosphate-buffered saline 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene- 2,2′-disulfonate. Structurally, Txnip belongs to the arrestin superfamily of proteins (14Alvarez C.E. BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 222Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The prototypical arrestins (the visual arrestins and the β-arrestins) are key regulators of receptor signaling. The β-arrestins, named for their interaction with the β-adrenergic receptor, are now known to control signaling through the multiple families of receptors (15Lefkowitz R.J. Rajagopal K. Whalen E.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These arrestin proteins have two wing-like arrestin domains arranged around a central core that detects and binds selectively to the charged phosphates of activated receptors (16Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 110: 465-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The arrestin domains then act as multifunctional scaffolds that cannot only quench receptor signals by recruiting endocytotic machinery and ubiquitin ligases, but also start new signal cascades (15Lefkowitz R.J. Rajagopal K. Whalen E.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Recently, arrestin-β2 has also been shown to play a key role in metabolism as a controller of insulin receptor signaling that is deficient in diabetes (17Luan B. Zhao J. Wu H. Duan B. Shu G. Wang X. Li D. Jia W. Kang J. Pei G. Nature. 2009; 457: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition to the classical visual/β-arrestins, a large number of arrestins more closely related to Txnip are present throughout multicellular evolution. These proteins have been termed the “α-arrestins,” as they are of more ancient origin than the visual/β family (14Alvarez C.E. BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 222Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although no structures are known of the α-arrestins to date, they appear highly likely to share the overall fold: two β-sheet sandwich arrestin domains connected by a short linker sequence (14Alvarez C.E. BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 222Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Mittal R. McMahon H.T. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 41-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Confidence in this prediction has been enhanced by the surprising finding that the vps26 family of proteins, even more distantly related to the classical arrestins than Txnip, also share the arrestin fold (19Shi H. Rojas R. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The vps26 proteins are a component of the retromer complex that controls retrograde transport of recycling endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. This functional overlap with visual/β-arrestin regulation of endocytosis suggests that control of endosome formation and transport may be a conserved function of the arrestin superfamily fold. The functions of the mammalian α-arrestins remain unclear. Humans have six α-arrestins: Txnip and five other proteins, which have been assigned the names Arrdc1–5 (arrestin domain-containing 1–5) (13Patwari P. Higgins L.J. Chutkow W.A. Yoshioka J. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21884-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Very little is known about these other α-arrestins; thioredoxin binding is not conserved beyond Txnip (13Patwari P. Higgins L.J. Chutkow W.A. Yoshioka J. Lee R.T. J. Biol.

EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 1216-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, as all the vertebrate α-arrestins have diverged from the ancestral α-arrestins (14Alvarez C.E. BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 222Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), their structure-function relationships may differ from yeast α-arrestins. Given that other α-arrestins are not thioredoxin-binding proteins, we hypothesized that Txnip metabolic functions may be conserved in mammalian α-arrestins and independent of its interaction with thioredoxin. Overexpression of Txnip in vitro can decrease levels of available thioredoxin and increase levels of reactive oxygen species (1Nishiyama A. Matsui M. Iwata S. Hirota K. Masutani H. Nakamura H.

Using overexpression of a mutant Txnip that does not bind thioredoxin, we show here that a major metabolic function of Txnip, its inhibition of glucose uptake, does not require interaction with thioredoxin. Instead, we show that inhibition of glucose uptake is a conserved function of another human α-arrestin, Arrdc4. Studies of Txnip mutants and chimeric α-arrestins suggest that the metabolic functions of Txnip and Arrdc4 are intrinsic to the arrestin domains. Human Txnip Cys-to-Ser mutants in pcDNA3.1 and V5-tagged mouse α-arrestins were as described previously (13Patwari P. Higgins L.J. Chutkow W.A. Yoshioka J. Lee R.T. J. Biol.

Human Txnip-C247S-Cherry-CDH and mouse Arrdc4-C184S-Xpress were made by mutagenesis as described above. Primary human skin fibroblasts (GM00498) were from Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ) and maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium with 15% fetal calf serum plus penicillin and streptomycin. 293T cells were from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 25 mm glucose, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm pyruvate, plus penicillin and streptomycin. Our mouse monoclonal anti-Txnip antibody JY2 (31Yoshioka J. Imahashi K. Gabel S.A. Chutkow W.A. Burds A.A. Gannon J. Schulze P.C. MacGillivray C. London R.E. Murphy E. Lee R.T. Circ.

Monoclonal anti-human thioredoxin (full-length) was from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). To stabilize the disulfide-linked Txnip-thioredoxin complex, we prevented disulfide exchange by alkylating free sulfhydryls with 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (AMS) (33Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 11857-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with Txnip wild type and mutant constructs. Two days after transfection, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and proteins were precipitated with ice-cold 0.54 m trichloroacetate in PBS. Lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min, then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with acetone, then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were briefly air-dried on ice then dissolved in AMS-labeling buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 25 mm AMS) and incubated at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation for 18 h. After adding nonreducing sample loading buffer and sonicating, the labeled proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. α-Arrestin-mCherry fusion constructs were overexpressed in dermal fibroblasts by overnight incubation in lentivirus diluted 1:1 in medium with 5 μg/ml polybrene. After 2–3 days, expression was verified by red epifluorescence. Four hours prior to labeling, medium was changed to 5.6 mm glucose to reduce endogenous Txnip expression. Cells were then washed three times in KRH-HEPES before addition of 100 μm 2-deoxyglucose and 125 μm 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (1 μCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min. Unincorporated radiolabel was removed by three washes in ice-cold PBS with 25 mm glucose. Cells were lysed in 0.2 n NaOH then neutralized with 6 n HCl. The radiolabel remaining in the cell lysates was measured by liquid scintillation counting. 293T cells were transfected and conditioned medium was collected after 2–3 days with no medium changes. Lactate was measured by a lactate dehydrogenase-based assay from Eton Biosciences, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Cells were plated on glass-bottomed chambers coated with 2 μg/ml fibronectin. Nuclei were stained with 1.6 μm Hoechst dye 33342. Single confocal sections were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope by sequential excitation at 405 nm and 543 nm. Data are reported as means ± S.E. Two-sample comparisons were made by two-sided Student's t-tests. We have previously demonstrated that a single cysteine-to-serine mutation (C247S for human Txnip) abolishes the ability of Txnip to bind thioredoxin-GST in an in vitro binding assay (13Patwari P. Higgins L.J. Chutkow W.A. Yoshioka J. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21884-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We therefore used the Txnip C247S mutant to test whether the interaction of thioredoxin with Txnip is required for Txnip metabolic functions. Specifically, we chose to characterize the inhibition of glucose uptake by Txnip because it is validated as an important Txnip function in vivo (7Parikh H. Carlsson E. Chutkow W.A. Johansson L.E. Storgaard H. Poulsen P. Saxena R. Ladd C. Schulze P.C. Mazzini M.J. Jensen C.B. Krook A. Björnholm M. Tornqvist H. Zierath J.R. Riddersträle M. Altshuler D. Lee R.T. Vaag A. Groop L.C. Mootha V.K.

We overexpressed wild type and C247S Txnip in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes by lentiviral transduction and measured glucose uptake by incorporation of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose. Uptake was expressed relative to the mean basal uptake of the cells infected with the empty vector control virus. Consistent with our previous studies (7Parikh H. Carlsson E. Chutkow W.A. Johansson L.E. Storgaard H. Poulsen P. Saxena R. Ladd C. Schulze P.C. Mazzini M.J. Jensen C.B. Krook A. Björnholm M. Tornqvist H. Zierath J.R. Riddersträle M. Altshuler D. Lee R.T. Vaag A. Groop L.C. Mootha V.K. PLoS Med. 2007; 4: e158Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), wild type Txnip inhibited adipocyte glucose uptake compared with an empty vector control under both basal (0.65 ± 0.04 versus 1.00 ± 0.05, p < 0.01) and insulin-stimulated (7.1 ± 0.3 versus 9.2 ± 0.2, p < 0.01) conditions (Fig. 1A). Unexpectedly, we found that overexpression of mutant Txnip C247S also inhibited adipocyte glucose uptake under basal (0.74 ± 0.05, p < 0.05 versus empty vector) and insulin-stimulated (7.78 ± 0.14, p < 0.01 versus empty vector) conditions, indicating that this function of Txnip is independent of binding to thioredoxin. To increase confidence that this result was generalizable to primary cells, we repeated the experiment with primary human skin fibroblasts. Lentiviral overexpression of wild type Txnip-Cherry inhibited glucose uptake compared with mCherry alone (Fig. 1B: 0.52 ± 0.03 versus 1.00 ± 0.07 respectively, p < 0.01), and overexpression of Txnip C247S-Cherry also significantly inhibited glucose uptake compared with mCherry alone (0.38 ± 0.01, p < 0.001). Western analysis confirmed overexpression of both wild type and mutant Txnip. To ensure that the C247S mutation abolishes the interaction of Txnip and thioredoxin in cells, we developed a new method for isolating intact Txnip-thioredoxin complexes. Because Txnip and thioredoxin may form a disulfide-linked complex (13Patwari P. Higgins L.J. Chutkow W.A. Yoshioka J. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21884-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), alkylation of free sulfhydryls should prevent loss of the complex by disulfide exchange. Using either N-ethylmaleimide or AMS as the alkylating agent, we confirmed that reaction of free sulfhydryls allows isolation of endogenous Txnip-thioredoxin complexes. We then tested whether overexpressed Txnip C63S and C247S interact with thioredoxin in cells. As an additional control, we also overexpressed Txnip C267S, a mutation of a highly conserved cysteine that does not affect binding to thioredoxin (13Patwari P. Higgins L.J. Chutkow W.A. Yoshioka J. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21884-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The constructs were overexpressed in 293T cells, which have undetectable endogenous Txnip protein levels. Cell lysates were labeled with AMS and Western analysis was performed. Anti-thioredoxin antibodies detected a single anti-thioredoxin-reactive band at the expected size of a Txnip and thioredoxin complex (∼62 kDa) with wild type Txnip as well as Txnip C63S and Txnip C267S, whereas no band was observed with Txnip C247S (Fig. 1C). Probing with anti-Txnip antibody JY2 verfied that the 62-kDa band was a Txnip-thioredoxin complex. In contrast, no Txnip-thioredoxin complex was detected with overexpression of Txnip C247S, despite equivalent expression of all Txnip mutant proteins. These data demonstrate that mutation of Txnip Cys-247 leads to loss of interaction with thioredoxin in cells and that inhibition of glucose uptake by Txnip is not affected by the C247S mutation despite loss of ability to bind to thioredoxin. Txnip appears to be unique among the α-arrestins in its ability to bind thioredoxin: we and others have shown that the 3 α-arrestins most closely related to Txnip (Arrdc4, Arrdc3, and Arrdc2, in order of homology) do not bind thioredoxin (13Patwari P. Higgins L.J. Chutkow W.A. Yoshioka J. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21884-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 20Oka S. Masutani H. Liu W. Horita H. Wang D. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Yodoi J. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because thioredoxin binding was not required for regulation of glucose uptake by Txnip, we hypothesized that regulation of glucose metabolism might be a function conserved in other α-arrestins. Therefore, we made lentiviral overexpression constructs for the α-arrestins, all with C-terminal mCherry fusions: human Txnip-Cherry, mouse Arrdc4-Cherry, and human Arrdc3-Cherry. First, we characterized the localization of the α-arrestin-cherry fusion proteins by confocal imaging of transfected 293T cells (Fig. 2, A–D). As previously reported, Txnip localized almost exclusively to the nucleus (Fig. 2B) (34Nishinaka Y. Masutani H. Oka S. Matsuo Y. Yamaguchi Y. Nishio K. Ishii Y. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37559-37565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Arrdc3 localized to the membrane and to numerous small vesicles in the cytoplasm, consistent with an association of Arrdc3 with endocytotic machinery, as suggested by Oka et al. (20Oka S. Masutani H. Liu W. Horita H. Wang D. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Yodoi J. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Localization of Arrdc4 was similar to that of Arrdc3, to both the cell membrane and cytoplasmic vesicles. No membrane localization was observed in the only previous characterization of Arrdc4 localization (in COS7 cells) (35Yamamoto Y. Sakamoto M. Fujii G. Kanetaka K. Asaka M. Hirohashi S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 297-303PubMed Google Scholar), which may be attributable to either cell type differences or to the use of live cell imaging here. Therefore, localization of both Arrdc4 and Arrdc3 is suggestive of a conserved arrestin-like involvement in vesicle endocytosis and trafficking for the mammalian α-arrestins. On transfection of the α-arrestins into 293T cells, we noted a striking change in the color of the culture medium: while the medium of cells transfected with mCherry alone and Arrdc3 turned orange-yellow as expected, the medium of cells transfected with Txnip and Arrdc4 remained red, suggesting an effect on either glucose uptake or metabolism. Normally, cell metabolism acidifies the medium, changing phenol red absorbance to yield yellow tones. In cell culture with glucose as the primary carbon source, medium is acidified largely by lactate (36Eagle H. Barban S. Levy M. Schulze H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lactate is the major endproduct of glucose uptake in immortalized cells in culture (37Reitzer L.J. Wice B.M. Kennell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2669-2676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is exported to the medium by facilitated diffusion (38Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). We therefore quantified the lactate concentration in the medium (Fig. 2E). Compared with cells overexpressing mCherry alone (57.5 ± 4.8 mm), cells overexpressing Txnip had greatly reduced lactate levels (30.6 ± 1.9 mm, p < 0.001). Overexpression of the α-arrestin Arrdc4 also strongly inhibited lactate release to the medium (28.9 ± 3.2 mm, p < 0.001 versus mCherry alone). In contrast, overexpression of Arrdc3 had no effect on lactate levels (62.2 ± 6.4, p = 0.58 versus mCherry alone). Overexpression of a fourth human α-arrestin, Arrdc2, also had no effect on lactate release (supplemental Fig. S1). To show that Arrdc4 inhibits glucose uptake, we determined the effect of overexpression of α-arrestins in primary human skin fibroblasts. 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake was divided by total protein content of the cell lysates to yield uptake per weight of total protein, then normalized to the level of the mCh"
https://openalex.org/W2058204099,"Objective Early life nutrition is critical for the development of hypothalamic neurons involved in energy homeostasis. We previously showed that intrauterine and early postnatal overnutrition programmed hypothalamic neurons expressing the appetite stimulator neuropeptide Y (NPY) and suppressor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in offspring at weaning. However, the long-term effects of such programming and its interactions with post-weaning high-fat-diet (HFD) consumption are unclear. Research Design and Methods Female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to chow or HFD for 5 weeks before mating, throughout gestation and lactation. On postnatal day 1, litters were adjusted to 3/litter to induce postnatal overnutrition (vs. 12 in control). At postnatal day 20, half of the rats from each maternal group were weaned onto chow or HFD for 15 weeks. Hypothalamic appetite regulators, and fuel (glucose and lipid) metabolic markers were measured. Results Offspring from obese dams gained more weight than those from lean dams independent of post-weaning diet. Maternal obesity interacted with post-weaning HFD consumption to cause greater levels of hyperphagia, adiposity, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance in offspring. This was linked to increased hypothalamic NPY signaling and leptin resistance in adult offspring. Litter size reduction had a detrimental impact on insulin and adiponectin, while hypothalamic NPY and POMC mRNA expression were suppressed in the face of normal energy intake and weight gain. Conclusions Maternal obesity, postnatal litter size reduction and post-weaning HFD consumption caused obesity via different neuroendocrine mechanims. There were strong additive effects of maternal obesity and post-weaning HFD consumption to increase the metabolic disorders in offspring."

https://openalex.org/W2093759002,"Community-based management and the establishment of marine reserves have been advocated worldwide as means to overcome overexploitation of fisheries. Yet, researchers and managers are divided regarding the effectiveness of these measures. The ""tragedy of the commons"" model is often accepted as a universal paradigm, which assumes that unless managed by the State or privatized, common-pool resources are inevitably overexploited due to conflicts between the self-interest of individuals and the goals of a group as a whole. Under this paradigm, the emergence and maintenance of effective community-based efforts that include cooperative risky decisions as the establishment of marine reserves could not occur. In this paper, we question these assumptions and show that outcomes of commons dilemmas can be complex and scale-dependent. We studied the evolution and effectiveness of a community-based management effort to establish, monitor, and enforce a marine reserve network in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Our findings build on social and ecological research before (1997-2001), during (2002) and after (2003-2004) the establishment of marine reserves, which included participant observation in >100 fishing trips and meetings, interviews, as well as fishery dependent and independent monitoring. We found that locally crafted and enforced harvesting rules led to a rapid increase in resource abundance. Nevertheless, news about this increase spread quickly at a regional scale, resulting in poaching from outsiders and a subsequent rapid cascading effect on fishing resources and locally-designed rule compliance. We show that cooperation for management of common-pool fisheries, in which marine reserves form a core component of the system, can emerge, evolve rapidly, and be effective at a local scale even in recently organized fisheries. Stakeholder participation in monitoring, where there is a rapid feedback of the systems response, can play a key role in reinforcing cooperation. However, without cross-scale linkages with higher levels of governance, increase of local fishery stocks may attract outsiders who, if not restricted, will overharvest and threaten local governance. Fishers and fishing communities require incentives to maintain their management efforts. Rewarding local effective management with formal cross-scale governance recognition and support can generate these incentives."
https://openalex.org/W1980091162,"DNA-damage-induced SOS mutations arise when Escherichia coli DNA polymerase (pol) V, activated by a RecA nucleoprotein filament (RecA*), catalyses translesion DNA synthesis. Here we address two longstanding enigmatic aspects of SOS mutagenesis, the molecular composition of mutagenically active pol V and the role of RecA*. We show that RecA* transfers a single RecA–ATP stoichiometrically from its DNA 3′-end to free pol V (UmuD′2C) to form an active mutasome (pol V Mut) with the composition UmuD′2C–RecA–ATP. Pol V Mut catalyses TLS in the absence of RecA* and deactivates rapidly upon dissociation from DNA. Deactivation occurs more slowly in the absence of DNA synthesis, while retaining RecA–ATP in the complex. Reactivation of pol V Mut is triggered by replacement of RecA–ATP from RecA*. Thus, the principal role of RecA* in SOS mutagenesis is to transfer RecA–ATP to pol V, and thus generate active mutasomal complex for translesion synthesis. Although it has been known that Escherichia coli DNA polymerase V is involved in the mutagenic process of limited DNA synthesis across a DNA lesion, the nature of the active complex and the requirement for an active filament of the strand exchange protein RecA have remained unclear. In this work, Goodman and colleagues have defined biochemically that active pol V consists of UmuD′2C, a single RecA monomer, and ATP. This ATP-bound RecA monomer cannot join UmuD′2C from solution but must be transferred from the RecA filament, thereby explaining its role in the process. Escherichia coli DNA polymerase (pol) V is involved in the mutagenic process of limited DNA synthesis across a DNA lesion, but the molecular composition of mutagenically active pol V and the importance of the RecA nucleoprotein filament RecA* have remained unclear. The biochemical role of RecA* is now defined."
https://openalex.org/W2012870439,"We recently reported a cell death cascade whereby cellular stressors activate nitric oxide formation leading to S-nitrosylation of GAPDH that binds to Siah and translocates to the nucleus. The nuclear GAPDH/Siah complex augments p300/CBP-associated acetylation of nuclear proteins, including p53, which mediate cell death. We report a 52 kDa cytosolic protein, GOSPEL, which physiologically binds GAPDH, in competition with Siah, retaining GAPDH in the cytosol and preventing its nuclear translocation. GOSPEL is neuroprotective, as its overexpression prevents NMDA-glutamate excitotoxicity while its depletion enhances death in primary neuron cultures. S-nitrosylation of GOSPEL at cysteine 47 enhances GAPDH-GOSPEL binding and the neuroprotective actions of GOSPEL. In intact mice, virally delivered GOSPEL selectively diminishes NMDA neurotoxicity. Thus, GOSPEL may physiologically regulate the viability of neurons and other cells."
https://openalex.org/W2088624253,"The survival of bacteria in nature is greatly enhanced by their ability to grow within surface-associated communities called biofilms. Commonly, biofilms generate proliferations of bacterial cells, called microcolonies, which are highly recalcitrant, 3-dimensional foci of bacterial growth. Microcolony growth is initiated by only a subpopulation of bacteria within biofilms, but processes responsible for this differentiation remain poorly understood. Under conditions of crowding and intense competition between bacteria within biofilms, microevolutionary processes such as mutation selection may be important for growth; however their influence on microcolony-based biofilm growth and architecture have not previously been explored. To study mutation in-situ within biofilms, we transformed Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells with a green fluorescent protein gene containing a +1 frameshift mutation. Transformed P. aeruginosa cells were non-fluorescent until a mutation causing reversion to the wildtype sequence occurs. Fluorescence-inducing mutations were observed in microcolony structures, but not in other biofilm cells, or in planktonic cultures of P. aeruginosa cells. Thus microcolonies may represent important foci for mutation and evolution within biofilms. We calculated that microcolony-specific increases in mutation frequency were at least 100-fold compared with planktonically grown cultures. We also observed that mutator phenotypes can enhance microcolony-based growth of P. aeruginosa cells. For P. aeruginosa strains defective in DNA fidelity and error repair, we found that microcolony initiation and growth was enhanced with increased mutation frequency of the organism. We suggest that microcolony-based growth can involve mutation and subsequent selection of mutants better adapted to grow on surfaces within crowded-cell environments. This model for biofilm growth is analogous to mutation selection that occurs during neoplastic progression and tumor development, and may help to explain why structural and genetic heterogeneity are characteristic features of bacterial biofilm populations."
https://openalex.org/W1968757816,"The large GTPase dynamin, best known for its activities that remodel membranes during endocytosis, also regulates F-actin-rich structures, including podosomes, phagocytic cups, actin comet tails, subcortical ruffles, and stress fibers. The mechanisms by which dynamin regulates actin filaments are not known, but an emerging view is that dynamin influences F-actin via its interactions with proteins that interact directly or indirectly with actin filaments. We show here that dynamin2 GTPase activity remodels actin filaments in vitro via a mechanism that depends on the binding partner and F-actin-binding protein, cortactin. Tightly associated actin filaments cross-linked by dynamin2 and cortactin became loosely associated after GTP addition when viewed by transmission electron microscopy. Actin filaments were dynamically unraveled and fragmented after GTP addition when viewed in real time using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Cortactin stimulated the intrinsic GTPase activity of dynamin2 and maintained a stable link between actin filaments and dynamin2, even in the presence of GTP. Filaments remodeled by dynamin2 GTPase in vitro exhibit enhanced sensitivity to severing by the actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, suggesting that GTPase-dependent remodeling influences the interactions of actin regulatory proteins and F-actin. The global organization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton was perturbed in U2-OS cells depleted of dynamin2, implicating dynamin2 in remodeling actin filaments that comprise supramolecular F-actin arrays in vivo. We conclude that dynamin2 GTPase remodels actin filaments and plays a role in orchestrating the global actomyosin cytoskeleton."

Ultraweak photon emission is known as the energy released as light through the changes in energy metabolism. We successfully imaged the diurnal change of this ultraweak photon emission with an improved highly sensitive imaging system using cryogenic charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. We found that the human body directly and rhythmically emits light. The diurnal changes in photon emission might be linked to changes in energy metabolism.
https://openalex.org/W1982645319,"The homopentameric B-subunit of bacterial protein Shiga toxin (STxB) binds to the glycolipid Gb3 in plasma membranes, which is the initial step for entering cells by a clathrin-independent mechanism. It has been suggested that protein clustering and lipid reorganization determine toxin uptake into cells. Here, we elucidated the molecular requirements for STxB induced Gb3 clustering and for the proposed lipid reorganization in planar membranes. The influence of binding site III of the B-subunit as well as the Gb3 lipid structure was investigated by means of high resolution methods such as fluorescence and scanning force microscopy. STxB was found to form protein clusters on homogenous 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/cholesterol/Gb3 (65∶30∶5) bilayers. In contrast, membranes composed of DOPC/cholesterol/sphingomyelin/Gb3 (40∶35∶20∶5) phase separate into a liquid ordered and liquid disordered phase. Dependent on the fatty acid composition of Gb3, STxB-Gb3 complexes organize within the liquid ordered phase upon protein binding. Our findings suggest that STxB is capable of forming a new membrane phase that is characterized by lipid compaction. The significance of this finding is discussed in the context of Shiga toxin-induced formation of endocytic membrane invaginations."
https://openalex.org/W2152029790,"Olfactory-based behaviors in mosquitoes are mediated by odorant-binding proteins (OBPs). They form a multigenic family involved in the peripheral events in insect olfaction, specifically the transport of odorants to membrane-bound odorant receptors. OBPs contribute to the remarkable sensitivity of the insect's olfactory system and may be involved in the selective transport of odorants. We have employed a combination of bioinformatics and molecular approaches to identify and characterize members of the “classic” OBP family in the Southern House mosquito Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus ( = Cx. quinquefasciatus), a vector of pathogens causing several human diseases. By taking advantage of the recently released genome sequences, we have identified fifty-three putative Cx. quinquefasciatus OBP genes by Blast searches. As a first step towards their molecular characterization, expression patterns by RT-PCR revealed thirteen genes that were detected exclusively and abundantly in chemosensory tissues. No clear differences were observed in the transcripts levels of olfactory-specific OBPs between antennae of both sexes using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Phylogenetic and comparative analysis revealed orthologous of Cx. quinquefasciatus OBPs in Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti. The identification of fifty-three putative OBP genes in Cx. quinquefasciatus highlights the diversity of this family. Tissue-specificity study suggests the existence of different functional classes within the mosquito OBP family. Most genes were detected in chemosensory as well as non chemosensory tissues indicating that they might be encapsulins, but not necessarily olfactory proteins. On the other hand, thirteen “true” OBP genes were detected exclusively in olfactory tissues and might be involved specifically in the detection of “key” semiochemicals. Interestingly, in Cx. quinquefasciatus olfactory-specific OBPs belong exclusively to four distinct phylogenetic groups which are particularly well conserved among three mosquito species."
https://openalex.org/W2145835530,"Background Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP), popularly known as Mw, is a cultivable, non-pathogenic organism, which, based on its growth and metabolic properties, is classified in Runyon Group IV along with M. fortuitum, M. smegmatis and M. vaccae. The novelty of this bacterium was accredited to its immunological ability to undergo antigen driven blast transformation of leukocytes and delayed hypersensitivity skin test in leprosy patients, a disease endemic in the Indian sub-continent. Consequently, MIP has been extensively evaluated for its biochemical and immunological properties leading to its usage as an immunomodulator in leprosy and tuberculosis patients. However, owing to advances in sequencing and culture techniques, the citing of new strains with almost 100% similarity in the sequences of marker genes like 16S rRNA, has compromised the identity of MIP as a novel species. Hence, to define its precise taxonomic position, we have carried out polyphasic taxonomic studies on MIP that integrate its phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular phylogenetic attributes. Methodology/Principal Findings The comparative analysis of 16S rRNA sequence of MIP by using BLAST algorithm at NCBI (nr database) revealed a similarity of ≥99% with M. intracellulare, M. arosiense, M. chimaera, M. seoulense, M. avium subsp. hominissuis, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and M. bohemicum. Further analysis with other widely used markers like rpoB and hsp65 could resolve the phylogenetic relationship between MIP and other closely related mycobacteria apart from M. intracellulare and M. chimaera, which shares ≥99% similarity with corresponding MIP orthologues. Molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on the concatenation of candidate orthologues of 16S rRNA, hsp65 and rpoB, also substantiated its distinctiveness from all the related organisms used in the analysis excluding M. intracellulare and M. chimaera with which it exhibited a close proximity. This necessitated further analysis of MIP with more sensitive and segregating parameters to ascertain its precise taxonomic position as a new species. The analysis of MIP and its comparison with other mycobacterial reference strains based on cellular and biochemical features, growth characteristics and chemotaxonomic studies like FAME profiling confirmed that MIP is uniquely endowed with diverse metabolic attributes that effectively distinguishes it from all the closely related mycobacteria including M. intracellulare and M. chimaera. Conclusion The results presented in this study coupled with the non-pathogenic nature and different biochemical and immunomodulatory properties of MIP affirm it as a distinct species belonging to M. avium complex (MAC). It is further proposed to use an earlier suggested name Mycobacterium indicus pranii for this newly established mycobacterial species. This study also exemplifies the growing need for a uniform, consensus based broader polyphasic frame work for the purpose of taxonomy and speciation, particularly in the genus Mycobacterium."
https://openalex.org/W2139765430,"C-reactive protein (CRP) levels>3 mg/L and>10 mg/L are associated with high and very high cardiovascular risk, respectively, in the general population. Because rheumatoid arthritis (RA) confers excess cardiovascular mortality, we determined the prevalence of these CRP levels among RA patients stratified on the basis of their RA disease activity.We evaluated physician and patient global assessments of disease activity, tender and swollen 28 joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and CRP measured in a single clinic visit for 151 RA patients. Disease activity was calculated using the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and the Disease Activity Score 28 Joints (DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP).Median CRP level was 5.3 mg/L. 68% of patients had CRP>3 mg/L, and 25% had CRP>10 mg/L. Of those with 0-1 swollen joints (n = 56), or 0-1 tender joints (n = 81), 64% and 67%, respectively, had CRP>3 mg/L, and 23% and 20%, respectively, had CRP>10 mg/L. Of those with remission or mildly active disease by CDAI (n = 58), DAS28-ESR (n = 39), or DAS28-CRP (n = 70), 49-66% had CRP>3 mg/L, and 10-14% had CRP>10 mg/L. Of patients with moderate disease activity by CDAI (n = 51), DAS28-ESR (n = 78), or DAS28-CRP (n = 66), 67-73% had CRP>3 mg/L, and 25-33% had CRP>10 mg/L.Even among RA patients whose disease is judged to be controlled by joint counts or standardized disease scores, a substantial proportion have CRP levels that are associated high or very high risk for future cardiovascular events in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2013289605,"Prior economic evaluations of adult and adolescent vaccination strategies against pertussis have reached disparate conclusions. Using static approaches only, previous studies failed to analytically include the indirect benefits derived from herd immunity as well as the impact of vaccination on the evolution of disease incidence over time.We assessed the impact of different pertussis vaccination strategies using a dynamic compartmental model able to consider pertussis transmission. We then combined the results with economic data to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of pertussis immunization strategies for adolescents and adults in the US. The analysis compares combinations of programs targeting adolescents, parents of newborns (i.e. cocoon strategy), or adults of various ages.In the absence of adolescent or adult vaccination, pertussis incidence among adults is predicted to more than double in 20 years. Implementing an adult program in addition to childhood and adolescent vaccination either based on 1) a cocoon strategy and a single booster dose or 2) a decennial routine vaccination would maintain a low level of pertussis incidence in the long run for all age groups (respectively 30 and 20 cases per 100,000 person years). These strategies would also result in significant reductions of pertussis costs (between -77% and -80% including additional vaccination costs). The cocoon strategy complemented by a single booster dose is the most cost-effective one, whereas the decennial adult vaccination is slightly more effective in the long run.By providing a high level of disease control, the implementation of an adult vaccination program against pertussis appears to be highly cost-effective and often cost-saving."
https://openalex.org/W2052957181,"Background Bacteria can be selectively imaged in experimentally-infected animals using exogenously administered 1-(2′deoxy-2′-fluoro-β-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-[125I]-iodouracil ([125I]-FIAU), a nucleoside analog substrate for bacterial thymidine kinase (TK). Our goal was to use this reporter and develop non-invasive methods to detect and localize Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Methodology/Principal Findings We engineered a M. tuberculosis strain with chromosomally integrated bacterial TK under the control of hsp60 - a strong constitutive mycobacterial promoter. [125I]FIAU uptake, antimicrobial susceptibilities and in vivo growth characteristics were evaluated for this strain. Using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), M. tuberculosis Phsp60 TK strain was evaluated in experimentally-infected BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ mice using the thigh inoculation or low-dose aerosol infection models. M. tuberculosis Phsp60 TK strain actively accumulated [125I]FIAU in vitro. Growth characteristics of the TK strain and susceptibility to common anti-tuberculous drugs were similar to the wild-type parent strain. M. tuberculosis Phsp60 TK strain was stable in vivo and SPECT imaging could detect and localize this strain in both animal models tested. Conclusion We have developed a novel tool for non-invasive assessment of M. tuberculosis in live experimentally-infected animals. This tool will allow real-time pathogenesis studies in animal models of TB and has the potential to simplify preclinical studies and accelerate TB research."
https://openalex.org/W2158020671,"Members of the predatory gastropod genus Conus use a venom comprised of a cocktail of peptide neurotoxins, termed conotoxins or conopeptides, to paralyze prey and conotoxin gene family members diversify via strong positive selection. Because Conus venoms are used primarily to subdue prey, the evolution of venoms is likely affected by predator-prey interactions.To identify the selective forces that drive the differentiation of venoms within species of Conus, we examined the distribution of alleles of a polymorphic O-superfamily conotoxin locus of Conus ebraeus at Okinawa, Guam and Hawaii. Previous analyses of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene sequences suggest that populations of C. ebraeus, a worm-eating Conus, are not structured genetically in the western and central Pacific. Nonetheless, because the sample size from Guam was relatively low, we obtained additional data from this location and reexamined patterns of genetic variation at the mitochondrial gene at Okinawa, Guam and Hawaii. We also utilized a DNA-based approach to identify prey items of individuals of C. ebraeus from Guam and compared this information to published data on diets at Okinawa and Hawaii. Our results show that conotoxin allelic frequencies differ significantly among all three locations, with strongest differentiation at Hawaii. We also confirm previous inferences that C. ebraeus exhibits no genetic differentiation between Okinawa, Guam and Hawaii at the mitochondrial locus. Finally, DNA-based analyses show that eunicid polychaetes comprise the majority of the prey items of C. ebraeus at Guam; while this results compares well with observed diet of this species at Okinawa, C. ebraeus preys predominantly on nereid polychaetes at Hawaii.These results imply that strong selection pressures affect conotoxin allelic frequencies. Based on the dietary information, the selection may derive from geographic variation in dietary specialization and local coevolutionary arms races between Conus and their prey."
https://openalex.org/W2132757904,"In the molecular oscillatory mechanism governing circadian rhythms, positive regulators, including CLOCK and BMAL1, transactivate Per and Cry genes through E-box elements, and translated PER and CRY proteins negatively regulate their own transactivation. Like BMAL1, its paralog BMAL2 dimerizes with CLOCK to activate the E-box-dependent transcription, but the role of BMAL2 in the circadian clockwork is still elusive. Here we characterized BMAL2 function in NIH3T3 cells and found that the cellular rhythms monitored by Bmal1 promoter-driven bioluminescence signals were blunted by RNA interference-mediated suppression of Bmal2 as well as that of Bmal1. Transcription assays with a 2.1-kb mPer1 promoter revealed that CRY2 inhibited the transactivation mediated by BMAL1-CLOCK more strongly than that by BMAL2-CLOCK. In contrast, PER2 showed a stronger inhibitory effect on BMAL2-CLOCK than on BMAL1-CLOCK. The molecular link between BMAL2 and PER2 was further strengthened by the fact that PER2 exhibited a greater affinity for BMAL2 than for BMAL1 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These results indicate a functional partnership between BMAL2 and PER2 and reemphasize the negative role of PER2 in the circadian transcription. As a broad spectrum function, BMAL2-CLOCK activated transcription from a variety of SV40-driven reporters harboring various E/E′-box-containing sequences present in the upstream regions of clock and clock-controlled genes.

Lett. 2001; 300: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The circadian rhythm of the locomotor activity is completely abolished in Bmal1-deficient mice (38Shearman L.P. Sriram S.

These observations indicate that Bmal2 does not compensate for Bmal1, but it has been left undetermined whether Bmal2 plays an active role in the mechanism of rhythm generation. In this study, physiological importance of BMAL2 was investigated in the cellular clock system by monitoring the circadian rhythms of bioluminescence signals driven by 2.8-kb Bmal1 promoter. The results illustrate nonredundant essential roles of the two BMALs in the cellular clock system. Molecular characterization by transcription assays together with physical interaction profiles among the relevant proteins revealed an intimate functional linkage between BMAL2 and PER2 and reemphasizes their roles as a positive and a negative regulator, respectively, in the E-box-dependent feedback loop of the molecular clock. The coding region of mBmal2a (GenBankTM accession number AY005163) or mBmal2b (GenBankTM accession number AY014836) was subcloned into pcDNA 3.1/V5-His expression vector (Invitrogen) so as to produce the protein without tags. For producing an N-terminally FLAG-tagged protein, the mBmal2a or mBmal2b cDNA was subcloned into a pcDNA 3.1/FLAG expression vector that was modified from pcDNA 3.1/V5-His (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequences were verified by sequencing. The mBmal1b cDNA (mJAP3/pBlueScript SK+) was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Fujii-Kuriyama and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His or the pcDNA3.1/FLAG expression vector to produce BMAL1b protein without tags or with an N-terminal FLAG tag, respectively.

Three copies of mCry1 E′-box (E-box like) element, AACGTG with its flanking sequences within the promoter/enhancer region of mouse Cry1 gene (5′-TTCAGAAACGTGAGGTGC-3′), were linked in tandem and inserted into an SV40-driven luciferase reporter (pGL3-Promoter vector, Promega) that had been digested by NheI and BglII.

Luciferase-reporter assays were performed in HEK293EBNA (HEK293) cells that were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Briefly, HEK293 cells plated in 12-well (Fig. 7) or 6-well plates (the other figures) were transfected with the indicated reporter constructs (20 ng/well in Fig. 7; 50 ng/well in the other figures) and a combination of various expression plasmids using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRL-SV40 (5 ng/well in Fig. 7, Promega) or pRL-CMV (0.5 ng/well in the other figures, Promega) was used as an internal control for normalization of the transfection efficiency. The total amount of the transfected plasmids was adjusted at a constant level (described in each experiment) by the addition of empty vector. The transfected cells were harvested 36 h (in Fig. 7) or 24 h (in the other figures) after the transfection, and the cell extracts were subjected to dual-luciferase assays according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For bioluminescence monitoring experiments, 7.5 × 105 cells were plated in 35-mm dishes, cultured for 24 h, and then transfected with 0.5 μg of mBmal1us2.8kb/pGL3 basic plasmid using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For overexpression-perturbation experiments, the cells were co-transfected with the indicated amounts of various expression plasmids, keeping the total amount of transfected DNA at 1.0 μg with pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector. For RNAi experiments, the cells were co-transfected with 50 pmol of Stealth RNAi (Invitrogen) against mBmal1 or mBmal2, which was designed by using BLOCK-iT RNAi designer. Stealth RNAi against firefly luciferase (as a positive control) and Stealth RNAi negative control medium GC duplex (Invitrogen; as a negative control) were also used. Their sequences were as follows: for mBmal1 sense, GGAAA UCAUG GAAAU CCACA GGAUA, and antisense, UAUCC UGUGG AUUUC CAUGA UUUCC; for mBmal2 sense, GUCCU GCUCA AAGAA GAAAG ACCAU, and antisense, AUGGU CUUUC UUCUU UGAGC AGGAC; and for luciferase sense, GCACU CUGAU UGACA AAUAC GAUUU, and antisense, AAAUC GUAUU UGUCA AUCAG AGUGC. Twenty four hours after the transfection, the cells in every experiment were treated with 0.1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma) for 2 h, and then the medium was replaced by 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm luciferin (Promega), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cellular bioluminescence signals driven by the mBmal1 promoter activity were continuously recorded with dish-type luminometer Kronos AB-2500 (ATTO) for a week. The amounts of proteins expressed in the cells were determined by immunoblot analysis. HEK293 cells plated in 6-well plates were transfected with a combination of constant amounts of FLAG-BMAL1, FLAG-BMAL2a, FLAG-BMAL2b, and PER2-HA expression plasmids (75, 750, 750, and 250 ng, respectively) and lysed with 100 μl of IPB2-H buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 °C, 2 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4). The cellular lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was diluted with 2 volumes of IPB2-L buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 °C, 2 mm EDTA, 5.5 mm NaCl, 1.35% Triton X-100, 12.5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 72.5 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4). The diluted lysates containing constant amounts of proteins (120 μg) were incubated with 1 μg of anti-HA antibody overnight at 4 °C and then incubated additionally for 1 h after mixing with 10 μl of 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed three times with IPB2 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 °C, 2 mm EDTA, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4), and the bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies. Relative levels of exogenously expressed FLAG-BMAL1 and FLAG-BMAL2 proteins were estimated by immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody (1:200, M2 monoclonal antibody, Sigma). HA-tagged CRY1, CRY2, and PER2 were detected by using anti-HA antibody (1:2,000, 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, Roche Applied Science). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (0.2 μg/ml; Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) antiserum was used as the secondary antibody. We first asked whether BMAL2 contributes to transcriptional activation of mPer1 and mPer2 genes by examining regulation of luciferase reporters driven by 2.1-kb mPer1 promoter (Fig. 1A) and 1.6-kb mPer2 promoter (Fig. 1B) in HEK293 cells. When BMAL or CLOCK was expressed individually in HEK293 cells, no significant increase of the transcriptional activity was observed (Fig. 1, A and B, 1st to 4th bars), indicating that endogenous levels of BMALs and CLOCK proteins do not contribute to the transactivation. The reporter activities of both mPer1 and mPer2 promoters were stimulated with increasing amounts of not only mouse BMAL1 but also mouse BMAL2 expression plasmid in combination with a fixed amount of CLOCK expression plasmid, indicating that BMAL2 can substitute for BMAL1 as a positive regulator for E/E′-box-mediated transcriptional activation. With increasing BMALs, the maximal level of the transcriptional activation of the mPer1 promoter by BMAL1-CLOCK was 1.6-fold higher than that caused by BMAL2-CLOCK (Fig. 1A). Similarly, BMAL1-CLOCK-dependent transactivation of the mPer2 promoter was maximally 1.6-fold higher than BMAL2-CLOCK-dependent one (Fig. 1B), suggesting a difference in molecular properties between the two BMALs. Higher doses of either BMAL1 or BMAL2 expression plasmid caused slight reduction of transactivation level of the mPer1 promoter as observed for chicken BMAL2 (34Okano T. Yamamoto K. Okano K. Hirota T. Kasahara T. Sasaki M. Takanaka Y. Fukada Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We previously found that a short variant of BMAL2 is expressed in the mouse hypothalamus, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus (35Okano T. Sasaki M. Fukada Y. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 300: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The short isoform named BMAL2b (35Okano T. Sasaki M. Fukada Y. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 300: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) has an N-terminal third part of full-length BMAL2 (BMAL2a) and retains bHLH and PAS-A domains but lacks PAS-B domain (supplemental Fig. 1A). BMAL2b did not transactivate the Per1 promoter in combination with CLOCK, although it weakly inhibited the transactivation mediated by BMAL1-CLOCK (supplemental Fig. 1B). In this study, BMAL2 denotes the long isoform, BMAL2a. We then investigated the vulnerability of the cellular clock mechanism, especially toward the perturbation in BMAL2 level in NIH3T3 cells. To this end, we employed real time monitoring of the cellular bioluminescence rhythms generated by 2.8-kb Bmal1 promoter-driven luciferase activity. Basic properties of the bioluminescence rhythm were almost unaffected by overexpression of BMAL1 (Fig. 2, B and C) or BMAL2 (Fig. 2, E and F) under the condition where exogenously expressed BMAL protein levels overwhelmed endogenous BMALs (supplemental Fig. 2). On the other hand, overexpression of the negative regulator, PER2 (Fig. 2, H and I), CRY1 (J and K), or CRY2 (L and M), impaired the cellular rhythms very severely. In contrast to the overexpression experiments, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of BMAL1 or BMAL2 significantly affected the Bmal1 promoter-driven bioluminescence rhythm. First, the knockdown efficiency was evaluated in HEK293 cells, in which transfection of siRNA against Bmal1 reduced the protein level of the exogenously expressed BMAL1 down to ∼38% of the control, leaving the BMAL2 level unaffected (Fig. 3A, left). On the other hand, transfection of siRNA against Bmal2 reduced the exogenously expressed BMAL2 protein level down to ∼31% of the control, while having no measurable effect on BMAL1 protein level (Fig. 3A, right). Then we examined the effect of the siRNA on the bioluminescent rhythms recorded from NIH3T3 cells, in which Bmal1 and Bmal2 are intrinsically transcribed (supplemental Fig. 3). The siRNA against Bmal1 blunted the circadian rhythmicity of NIH3T3 cells in all the six experiments (Fig. 3, B–G). These results demonstrate an essential role of BMAL1 in the circadian oscillation of the cellular clock and come into line with the arrhythmic behavior of Bmal1-deficient mice observed in constant darkness (38Shearman L.P. Sriram S. Weaver D.R. Maywood E.S. Chaves I. Zheng B. Kume K. Lee C.C. van der Horst G.T. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M. Science. 2000; 288: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Importantly, the siRNA against Bmal2 blunted the bioluminescence rhythms in four of six independent sets of experiments (Fig. 3, B–E), although diminished rhythmicities remained in the other two cases (Fig. 3, F and G). Thus, the siRNA against Bmal1 and Bmal2 had discernible effects on the cellular circadian rhythms of NIH3T3 cells, possibly because of their distinct action points on the clockwork (see “Discussion”). These results indicate that the two BMALs do not compensate for each other in the cellular clockwork and suggest that the point(s) affected by Bmal1 suppression is more central to the c"

This primer focuses on shotgun-proteomics-based tandem mass spectrometry for the identification of proteins in a complex mixture. It describes the basic concepts of protein differential expression analysis and posttranslational modification analysis and discusses several strategies to improve the coverage of the proteome. The development of new technology is often a driving force for new directions in biological research. Proteomics is the study of the proteins expressed in a specific cell, tissue, or organism (Wilkins et al., 1996Wilkins M.R. Pasquali C. Appel R.D. Ou K. Golaz O. Sanchez J.C. Yan J.X. Gooley A.A. Hughes G. Humphery-Smith I. et al.From proteins to proteomes: large scale protein identification by two-dimensional electrophoresis and amino acid analysis.Biotechnology (N. Y.). 1996; 14: 61-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of genome sequences for many organisms has generated databases of predicted protein sequences that are indispensable resources for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. As the in silico analysis of the human genome has refined the number of genes to ∼22,000, it is clear that protein regulation creates functional diversity. The human body consists of roughly 250 different cell types with different temporal and spatial protein expression patterns, alternatively spliced variants, posttranslational modifications (PTMs), and transient protein-protein interactions. To analyze highly complex biological samples, a widely used technology is mass spectrometry-based proteomics. “Shotgun” proteomics is a powerful approach for identifying and quantifying proteins. In this technique, protein mixtures are converted to peptides by proteolytic digestion, and these peptides are used as surrogates for identification and quantitation of the proteins present in the original mixture (Figure 1). First, peptides are fractionated to reduce sample complexity and then ionized for tandem mass spectrometry analysis (MS/MS). The ions are mass-selected in the first stage of analysis (MS1), fragmented, and the fragmentation ions are analyzed in the second stage of mass analysis (MS2). The MS2 spectra are searched against a protein sequence database to identify the amino acid sequence of the peptides and extrapolate the identities of the proteins in the sample. The major advantage of shotgun proteomics is its ability to identify and quantify thousands of proteins in a single analysis. In this article, we explain the basic principles of mass spectrometry, its use in shotgun proteomic analysis of complex protein samples, and how it has been applied in neuroscience research. We direct the reader to recent reviews for information on other useful mass spectrometry-based platforms, including intact protein or “top-down” analysis (Breuker et al., 2008Breuker K. Jin M. Han X.

From exogenous to endogenous: the inevitable imprint of mass spectrometry in metabolomics.J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Finally, we would like to emphasis that, before beginning shotgun experiments in the nervous system, a researcher must consider the issues of the experimental design, sample quantity and purity, the large amount of data that will likely be obtained, and the bioinformatic approaches that will be used to the analyze the data. An important aspect of proteomic experiments is the experimental design. Numerous methods have been developed to address the needs of specific experiments, and in this section, we provide a guide to common proteomic experiments. How an experiment is performed, what controls are used, and what parameters should be used in data analysis are dependent on the questions being asked. Sample preparation will depend on the complexity of the protein mixture. An experiment to measure changes in protein expression as a result of cell surface receptor activation requires an approach that covers a large fraction of the proteome. In contrast, identification of a protein complex does not require analysis of a highly complex mixture of proteins. However, shotgun proteomics is not always a preferred approach. For example, shotgun proteomics is only useful if a complex is able to be purified to sufficient quantity. If changes in the expression level of one individual protein are sought and an antibody is available, shotgun proteomics would not offer an advantage, but could provide a secondary and more accurate means of quantitation. The first question that arises when designing a proteomic experiment is the amount of protein required for MS/MS analysis. A general rule of thumb is that, if a sample can be detected by silver stain on a gel (equivalent to a few nanograms of protein), it can be detected by a mass spectrometer. With MudPIT analysis (described below), 100 μg total brain homogenate can yield more than 2000 nonredundant protein identifications (Chen et al., 2008aChen E.I. McClatchy D. Park S.K. Yates Iii J.R. Comparisons of mass spectrometry compatible surfactants for global analysis of the mammalian brain proteome.Anal. Chem. 2008; 80: 8694-8701Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When specific fractions or small brain regions, such as the synaptosomal fraction or the amygdala, are investigated, the required number of animals increases. Thus, there are continuing efforts to generate more data from less starting material. For example, Nielsen et al. have developed a novel extraction scheme to comprehensively analyze plasma membranes from a single mouse hippocampus (Nielsen et al., 2005Nielsen P.A. Olsen J.V. Podtelejnikov A.V. Andersen J.R. Mann M. Wisniewski J.R. Proteomic mapping of brain plasma membrane proteins.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). When isolating a specific complex or organelle, the sample purity is critical. Common copurified abundant proteins can obscure the identification of components of the targeted complex or organelle. Before mass spectrometry analysis, the purity of the complex must be verified by methods such as western blot analysis or enzymatic assays. Experiments should also be performed to demonstrate the exclusion of contaminants. For example, a nuclear isolation should have greater immunoreactivity for nuclear markers in western blot analysis and, just as important, should have a decrease of cytosolic markers compared to a total lysate. Since MS/MS analysis is a global analysis, it is a better indicator of sample purity than many traditional biochemical analyses and may be used to optimize purification methods. If a protein or a group of proteins is the aim of a study, specific immunological or affinity methods can be used to enrich and purify the target proteins of interest.

Such methods specifically capture the proteins interacting with the target protein; when combined with shotgun proteomics, they tend to provide lists of protein identifications with many potential true targets. A number of nonspecific, contaminant proteins are also likely to be included. By including a control sample with the target protein “knockout,” or a nonspecific IgG control in immunoprecipitation experiments, many contaminants can be eliminated. In the TAP method, tags are fused in tandem to the target protein, and the fusion construct is expressed in the host cells. This two-step affinity-purification procedure not only greatly reduces contaminant proteins but also allows the efficient elution of the target protein with its interaction partners. Alternatively, subtractive analysis techniques and stable isotope labeling (see Quantitation) have been employed to discriminate between contaminants and true components of the desired complex (Blagoev et al., 2003Blagoev B.

Although there are many different proteolytic enzymes available, trypsin is the most commonly employed. It is highly specific, cleaving at the carboxyl terminus of arginine and lysine residues. Since these are abundant residues, almost all proteins of the proteome will possess multiple tryptic peptides. The peptides vary in length, ranging from a few to greater than 40 residues, averaging 9–10 residues (Elias and Gygi, 2007Elias J.E. Gygi S.P.

One potential obstacle with the analysis of biological samples is that common detergents (e.g., triton or SDS), salts, phosphate or sulfate buffers, and polyethylene glycols are incompatible with mass spectrometry analysis.

To solubilize proteins for enzymatic digestion, chaotropic agents, usually urea or guanidine hydrochloride, are used instead of detergents. The drawback of these chaotropic reagents is that they can inhibit protease activity at the concentration required for efficient protein denaturation and solubilization (Rajagopalan et al., 1961Rajagopalan K.V. Fridovich I. Handler P. Competitive inhibition of enzyme activity by urea.J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, the concentration of these reagents can be reduced by dilution before the addition of the protease. Membrane proteins are underrepresented in most proteomic analyses unless specific protocols are applied (Speers and Wu, 2007Speers A.E. Wu C.C. Proteomics of integral membrane proteins–theory and application.Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 3687-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). One challenge for the analysis of complex mixtures containing membrane proteins is to maintain solubility throughout the entire isolation and separation process. To overcome this difficulty, numerous mass spectrometry-compatible detergents have been developed (Chen et al., 2007Chen E.I. Cociorva D. Norris J.L. Yates 3rd, J.R.

Additionally, using alternative proteolytic enzymes, such as proteinase K (Wu et al., 2003Wu C.C. MacCoss M.J. Howell K.E. Yates 3rd, J.R.

Furthermore, performing the digestion in the presence of organic solvents such as acetonitrile or methanol can aid in membrane protein identification (Blonder et al., 2002Blonder J. Goshe M.B.

Proteomic analysis of brain plasma membranes isolated by affinity two-phase partitioning.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) are used. To remove abundant soluble proteins and membrane-associated proteins, membrane fractions can be washed with buffers containing high salt. Alternatively, membranes can be incubated in a high-pH buffer followed by mechanical agitation, which opens membrane vesicles into membrane sheets, releasing trapped soluble proteins (Howell and Palade, 1982Howell K.E. Palade G.E. Hepatic Golgi fractions resolved into membrane and content subfractions.J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 822-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2003Wu C.C. MacCoss M.J. Howell K.E. Yates 3rd, J.R. A method for the comprehensive proteomic analysis of membrane proteins.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Many of these strategies require large amounts of starting material. Combining these enrichment and digestion strategies is the best way to increase the coverage of low abundant membrane proteins by MS analysis (Fischer et al., 2006Fischer F. Wolters D. Rogner M.

Shotgun analysis of integral membrane proteins facilitated by elevated temperature.Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 4613-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Research is still ongoing to improve the identification of membrane proteins from complex mixtures, since these proteins are important drug targets in many human diseases. Due to the complexity and abundance range of proteins in cells, fractionation is essential to maximize protein identifications. Subcellular fractionation of whole-tissue homogenates or isolation of specific protein complexes can reduce sample complexity and facilitate the identification of low-abundance proteins. For example, a specific neuronal structure such as the postsynaptic density (PSD) will be difficult to analyze from total brain homogenate, but isolation of PSD can reduce the dynamic range and aid in protein identification. A potential disadvantage is that fractionation often requires more starting material. Here, we highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the most popular fractionation techniques. Other peptide-separation schemes for mass spectrometry analysis are currently under investigation (Gilar et al., 2005Gilar M. Olivova P. Daly A.E. Gebler J.C.

High-efficiency nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled on-line with mass spectrometry using nanoelectrospray ionization for proteomics.Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4235-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and it should be noted that there is no fractionation method that is clearly superior to others for all experiments and samples. Fractionation can be employed at the protein or peptide level. For shotgun proteomics, an optional protein-fractionation step precedes peptide fractionation. Various protein-fractionation techniques have been developed to reduce sample complexity, including electrophoresis, chromatography, and isoelectric focusing. Traditional two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by MS/MS analysis has provided a wealth of information to neuroscience (Tannu and Hemby, 2006Tannu N.S. Hemby S.E. Methods for proteomics in neuroscience.Prog. Brain Res. 2006; 158: 41-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this strategy, digestion of the proteins occurs in the gel, and the peptides are extracted prior to MS/MS analysis. Contaminants such as salt and detergents are removed during the procedure, minimizing their interference with MS/MS analysis, but peptides can be lost during the extraction step (Granvogl et al., 2007Granvogl B. Ploscher M. Eichacker L.A. Sample preparation by in-gel digestion for mass spectrometry-based proteomics.Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2007; 389: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The molecular weight and isoelectric point of the protein are known prior to MS/MS analysis, providing increased confidence for the identification of proteins. In addition, the density difference between gel spots can provide information regarding relative protein abundance between samples. The disadvantages include inefficiency in resolving very large (>200 kD) or very small (<10 kD), hydrophobic, extremely acidic or basic, and low-abundant proteins. Furthermore, many spots contain more than one protein, and a partially modified protein can migrate in multiple spots (Corthals et al., 2000Corthals G.L. Wasinger V.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Sanchez J.C.

One-dimensional SDS-PAGE is also extensively used (Shevchenko et al., 2006Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. In-gel digestion for mass spectrometric characterization of proteins and proteomes.Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), and since many laboratories routinely perform 1D SDS-PAGE, this technique can be more accessible than 2D PAGE. Recently, a clever brain-fractionation method was developed, termed voxelation, which provides high-resolution spatial proteome mapping (Petyuk et al., 2007Petyuk V.A. Qian W.J. Chin M.H. Wang H. Livesay E.A. Monroe M.E. Adkins J.N. Jaitly N. Anderson D.J.

In this method, the brain is divided into tiny equal-sized cubes or voxels, which are digested and subjected to peptide fractionation and MS/MS analysis. Although many types of chromatography can be employed to resolve peptides, reversed-phase (RP) chromatography is the workhorse for the analysis of peptide mixtures. RP chromatography efficiently separates peptides based on their hydrophobicity (Aguilar and Hearn, 1996Aguilar M.I. Hearn M.T. High-resolution reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of peptides and proteins.Methods Enzymol. 1996; 270: 3-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Sandra et al., 2007Sandra K. Moshir M. D'Hondt F. Verleysen K. Kas K. Sandra P. Highly efficient peptide separations in proteomics Part 1. Unidimensional high performance liquid chromatography.J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2007; 866: 48-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Peptides are eluted directly from the chromatography column into the mass spectrometer with an increasing gradient of an organic solvent, such as acetonitrile (ACN). If protein fractionation techniques are employed to reduce sample complexity prior to digestion, then RP chromatography can be sufficient. If a complex protein mixture (i.e., a synaptosomal fraction), however, is digested without prior protein fractionation, it can overwhelm the resolution capability of RP chromatography by coelution of too many peptides. To meet the technical challenge of resolving thousands of peptides, the greater separation power of multidimensional liquid chromatography (LC/LC, 2D), proposed initially by Giddings, is employed (Giddings, 1984Giddings J.C. Two-dimensional separations: concept and promise.Anal. Chem. 1984; 56: 12"

Following our demonstration that bat activity is reduced in the vicinity of large air traffic control and weather radars, we tested the hypothesis that an electromagnetic signal from a small portable radar can act as a deterrent to foraging bats. From June to September 2007 bat activity was compared at 20 foraging sites in northeast Scotland during experimental trials (radar switched on) and control trials (no radar signal). Starting 45 minutes after sunset, bat activity was recorded for a period of 30 minutes during each trial and the order of trials were alternated between nights. From July to September 2008 aerial insects at 16 of these sites were sampled using two miniature light-suction traps. At each site one of the traps was exposed to a radar signal and the other functioned as a control. Bat activity and foraging effort per unit time were significantly reduced during experimental trials when the radar antenna was fixed to produce a unidirectional signal therefore maximising exposure of foraging bats to the radar beam. However, although bat activity was significantly reduced during such trials, the radar had no significant effect on the abundance of insects captured by the traps."

https://openalex.org/W2004186922,"Resistance developed by leukemic cells, unsatisfactory efficacy on patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) at accelerated and blastic phases, and potential cardiotoxity, have been limitations for imatinib mesylate (IM) in treating CML. Whether low dose IM in combination with agents of distinct but related mechanisms could be one of the strategies to overcome these concerns warrants careful investigation.We tested the therapeutic efficacies as well as adverse effects of low dose IM in combination with proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib (BOR) or proteasome inhibitor I (PSI), in two CML murine models, and investigated possible mechanisms of action on CML cells. Our results demonstrated that low dose IM in combination with BOR exerted satisfactory efficacy in prolongation of life span and inhibition of tumor growth in mice, and did not cause cardiotoxicity or body weight loss. Consistently, BOR and PSI enhanced IM-induced inhibition of long-term clonogenic activity and short-term cell growth of CML stem/progenitor cells, and potentiated IM-caused inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis of BCR-ABL+ cells. IM/BOR and IM/PSI inhibited Bcl-2, increased cytoplasmic cytochrome C, and activated caspases. While exerting suppressive effects on BCR-ABL, E2F1, and beta-catenin, IM/BOR and IM/PSI inhibited proteasomal degradation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading to a re-activation of this important negative regulator of BCR-ABL. In addition, both combination therapties inhibited Bruton's tyrosine kinase via suppression of NFkappaB.These data suggest that combined use of tyrosine kinase inhibitor and proteasome inhibitor might be helpful for optimizing CML treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2097749235,"Inositol is a precursor of numerous phospholipids and signalling molecules essential for the cell. Schizosaccharomyces pombe is naturally auxotroph for inositol as its genome does not have a homologue of the INO1 gene encoding inositol-1-phosphate synthase, the enzyme responsible for inositol biosynthesis. In this work, we demonstrate that inositol starvation in S. pombe causes cell death with apoptotic features. This apoptotic death is dependent on the metacaspase Pca1p and is affected by the UPR transducer Ire1p. Previously, we demonstrated that calnexin is involved in apoptosis induced by ER stress. Here, we show that cells expressing a lumenal version of calnexin exhibit a 2-fold increase in the levels of apoptosis provoked by inositol starvation. This increase is reversed by co-expression of a calnexin mutant spanning the transmembrane domain and C-terminal cytosolic tail. Coherently, calnexin is physiologically cleaved at the end of its lumenal domain, under normal growth conditions when cells approach stationary phase. This cleavage suggests that the two naturally produced calnexin fragments are needed to continue growth into stationary phase and to prevent cell death. Collectively, our observations indicate that calnexin takes part in at least two apoptotic pathways in S. pombe, and suggest that the cleavage of calnexin has regulatory roles in apoptotic processes involving calnexin."

Here, we report the nanomechanical, in situ monitoring of proteolysis of peptide chain attributed to protease (Cathepsin B) by using a resonant nanomechanical microcantilever immersed in a liquid. Specifically, the detection is based on measurement of resonant frequency shift arising from proteolysis of peptides (leading to decrease of cantilever's overall mass, and consequently, increases in the resonance). It is shown that resonant microcantilever enables the quantification of proteolysis efficacy with respect to protease concentration. Remarkably, the nanomechanical, in situ monitoring of proteolysis allows us to gain insight into the kinetics of proteolysis of peptides, which is well depicted by Langmuir kinetic model. This implies that nanomechanical biosensor enables the characterization of specific cellular protease such as its kinetics."

https://openalex.org/W2049973173,"Microtubule arrays are remodeled as cells proceed through the cell cycle. It is important to understand how remodeling is regulated in time and space. In fission yeast, the conserved microtubule associated TACC/TOG complex plays an important role in organizing microtubules throughout the cell cycle. Here we show that this complex undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling through the nuclear import and export signals located in the TACC protein Mia1p/Alp7p. When the Crm1p-dependent nuclear export signal of Mia1p is disabled, Mia1p accumulates in the nucleus while its partner protein Alp14p/TOG is restricted to the cytoplasm. This leads to defects in assembly of both interphase arrays and the mitotic spindle. Artificial targeting of Alp14p to the nucleus partially rescues the mitotic spindle defects caused by lack of Mia1p nuclear export. Interestingly, the nuclear export sequence of Mia1p appears to overlap with the Alp14p binding site. We propose that intricate regulation of the subcellular distribution of TACC/TOG complexes drives microtubule array remodeling as cells progress through the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2139240444,"Although the human genome database has been completed a decade ago, approximately 50% of the proteome remains hypothetical as their functions are unknown. The elucidation of the functions of these hypothetical proteins can lead to additional protein pathways and revelation of new cascades. However, many of these inferences are limited to proteins with substantial sequence similarity. Of particular interest here is the Tectonin domain-containing family of proteins.We have identified hTectonin, a hypothetical protein in the human genome database, as a distant ortholog of the limulus galactose binding protein (GBP). Phylogenetic analysis revealed strong evolutionary conservation of hTectonin homologues from parasite to human. By computational analysis, we showed that both the hTectonin and GBP form beta-propeller structures with multiple Tectonin domains, each containing beta-sheets of 4 strands per beta-sheet. hTectonin is present in the human leukocyte cDNA library and immune-related cell lines. It interacts with M-ficolin, a known human complement protein whose ancient homolog, carcinolectin (CL5), is the functional protein partner of GBP during infection. Yeast 2-hybrid assay showed that only the Tectonin domains of hTectonin recognize the fibrinogen-like domain of the M-ficolin. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed real-time interaction between the Tectonin domains 6 & 11 and bacterial LPS, indicating that despite forming 2 beta-propellers with its different Tectonin domains, the hTectonin molecule could precisely employ domains 6 & 11 to recognise bacteria.By virtue of a recent finding of another Tectonin protein, leukolectin, in the human leukocyte, and our structure-function analysis of the hypothetical hTectonin, we propose that Tectonin domains of proteins could play a vital role in innate immune defense, and that this function has been conserved over several hundred million years, from invertebrates to vertebrates. Furthermore, the approach we have used could be employed in unraveling the characteristics and functions of other hypothetical proteins in the human proteome."
https://openalex.org/W1968575202,"Microchips that make use of light instead of electrons could outperform their electronic counterparts if light flow can be controlled at will. Photonic crystals are instrumental in achieving such a manoeuvre. In photonic crystals, suitable variations of the refractive index with a periodicity comparable to the wavelength of the light passing through gives rise to so-called photonic bandgaps, energy (frequency) ranges where the photons cannot propagate. Photonic bandgap materials are candidates to provide the necessary tools for guiding and manipulating photons in optical circuits. So far, the basic approaches for photonic control have been based on embedding artificial defects and light emitters inside these three-dimensional materials. Kenji Ishizaki and Susumu Noda now demonstrate experimentally that, in fact, the surface of such photonic materials support two-dimensional (photonic) surface states that can be easily manipulated to control photons (by guiding and trapping, for instance), thus providing a new and versatile approach for the manipulation of photons in these materials."
https://openalex.org/W2096881824,"Background Protein structures are critical for understanding the mechanisms of biological systems and, subsequently, for drug and vaccine design. Unfortunately, protein sequence data exceed structural data by a factor of more than 200 to 1. This gap can be partially filled by using computational protein structure prediction. While structure prediction Web servers are a notable option, they often restrict the number of sequence queries and/or provide a limited set of prediction methodologies. Therefore, we present a standalone protein structure prediction software package suitable for high-throughput structural genomic applications that performs all three classes of prediction methodologies: comparative modeling, fold recognition, and ab initio. This software can be deployed on a user's own high-performance computing cluster. Methodology/Principal Findings The pipeline consists of a Perl core that integrates more than 20 individual software packages and databases, most of which are freely available from other research laboratories. The query protein sequences are first divided into domains either by domain boundary recognition or Bayesian statistics. The structures of the individual domains are then predicted using template-based modeling or ab initio modeling. The predicted models are scored with a statistical potential and an all-atom force field. The top-scoring ab initio models are annotated by structural comparison against the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) fold database. Furthermore, secondary structure, solvent accessibility, transmembrane helices, and structural disorder are predicted. The results are generated in text, tab-delimited, and hypertext markup language (HTML) formats. So far, the pipeline has been used to study viral and bacterial proteomes. Conclusions The standalone pipeline that we introduce here, unlike protein structure prediction Web servers, allows users to devote their own computing assets to process a potentially unlimited number of queries as well as perform resource-intensive ab initio structure prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2054419962,"Actin can exist in multiple conformations necessary for normal function. Actin isoforms, although highly conserved in sequence, exhibit different biochemical properties and cellular roles. We used amide proton hydrogen/deuterium (HD) exchange detected by mass spectrometry to analyze conformational differences between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and muscle actins in the G and F forms to gain insight into these differences. We also utilized HD exchange to study interdomain and allosteric communication in yeast-muscle hybrid actins to better understand the conformational dynamics of actin. Areas showing differences in HD exchange between G- and F-actins are areas of intermonomer contacts, consistent with the current filament models. Our results showed greater exchange for yeast G-actin compared with muscle actin in the barbed end pivot region and areas in subdomains 1 and 2 and for F-actin in monomer-monomer contact areas. These results suggest greater flexibility of the yeast actin monomer and filament compared with muscle actin. For hybrid G-actins, the muscle-like and yeastlike parts of the molecule generally showed exchange characteristics resembling their parent actins. A few exceptions were a peptide on top of subdomain 2 and the pivot region between subdomains 1 and 3 with muscle actin-like exchange characteristics although the areas were yeastlike. These results demonstrate that there is cross-talk between subdomains 1 and 2 and the large and small domains.

Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar, 3Chesarone M.A. Goode B.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Such regulation demands that both the monomeric and filamentous forms of actin be able to exist in a number of different conformations. Some of these may be differentially recognized by different actin-binding proteins, and some might actually be induced by the interaction of actin with these proteins. Actin is highly conserved from yeast to humans. There is 87% sequence identity between yeast and muscle actin and 91% sequence identity between yeast and nonmuscle actins. Even with this high sequence similarity and minor differences in crystal structures, there are some major differences in yeast and muscle actin behavior. Yeast, compared with muscle actin, polymerizes faster and exchanges its bound nucleotide faster. In contrast to muscle actin, the yeast actin filament releases its Pi almost immediately after ATP hydrolysis and the filament fragments more readily (4Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Yeast cells cannot survive with muscle actin as the sole actin, and with β-nonmuscle actin as the only actin, yeast cells are very sick (5Karlsson R. Aspenström P. Byström A.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 213-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A set of biochemical data indicates that the muscle filament is less flexible than yeast (6Prochniewicz E. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14860-14867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 7De La Cruz E.M. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14054-14061Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, conformational and structural differences that could explain these behavioral differences are unknown. The actin molecule is divided into two domains, the small domain consisting of subdomains 1 and 2 and the large domain consisting of subdomains 3 and 4. Modeling studies (8Tirion M.M. ben-Avraham D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9Page R. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have suggested that each of the subdomains can move, and biochemical studies have suggested allosteric interactions between the subdomains. However, the nature of these interactions has not been elucidated on a molecular level. To try to gain insight into what parts of the actin molecule are important for the behavioral differences observed between yeast and muscle actin, yeast-muscle hybrid actins were constructed (10McKane M. Wen K.K. Meyer A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29916-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hybrid sub1 actin has muscle-specific residues introduced into the small domain of actin, making it muscle-like in subdomain 1 and yeastlike in subdomains 2, 3, and 4. Sub12 hybrid actin has muscle-specific residues in both subdomains 1 and 2, making it muscle-like in subdomains 1 and 2 and yeastlike in subdomains 3 and 4. These actins showed muscle-like behavior in several biochemical properties: nucleotide exchange rates, thermostability, and the nucleation phase during polymerization. Although most of the residues proposed to be involved in the interaction of actin with myosin are located in subdomains 1 and 2, both hybrids exhibited yeast actin behavior in the activation of myosin ATPase activity. The hybrid actins also exhibited higher critical concentrations than either yeast or muscle actin and formed ADP-F-actin that was less stable than either yeast or muscle actin (10McKane M. Wen K.K. Meyer A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29916-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The experimental results with the hybrid actins indicated that the behavior of actin as a whole is dictated by the interaction and cross-talk of the two halves. One experimental approach to further understand the structural bases of 1) biochemical differences observed with yeast and muscle actins, 2) how introduction of muscle-specific residues affects conformational behavior of the hybrids, and 3) whether there is propagation of change and cross-talk from muscle domains into yeast domains of the hybrid actins in solution is to use NMR. However, NMR as a technique is not suitable here due to the high actin concentrations that would be needed and the propensity of actin to aggregate at these concentrations. Therefore, we utilized hydrogen-deuterium (HD) 2The abbreviation used is:HDhydrogen/deuterium. exchange detected with mass spectrometry. This is a powerful technique that can be used to obtain information about conformational changes in proteins in solution on a global as well as a local level. hydrogen/deuterium. A protein sample placed in a deuterated solution will exchange its amide protons of the polypeptide backbone with exchange times varying from seconds to months (11Engen J.R. Smith D.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 146: 95-112PubMed Google Scholar). The amount and rate of deuterium exchange will depend on factors like temperature, pD, accessible surface area, local environment, and conformational flexibility (12Englander S.W. Kallenbach N.R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1983; 16: 521-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 13Bai Y. Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Science. 1995; 269: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 14Kim K.S. Woodward C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9609-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Ehring H. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Labeled protein samples are digested by pepsin, the protease of choice in HD experiments, because of the requirement for acidic pH in order to minimize back exchange. The resulting peptide fragments are separated by high pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed for deuterium uptake. For a peptide that is undergoing amide proton exchange, the average mass of the peptide will increase with labeling time with an increase in mass greater for the peptides that are more exposed to the solvent. The analysis of deuterium uptake for specific peptides and areas of proteins could potentially provide information about structural and conformational differences between different actin forms. Since changes in conformation among different actin states will affect deuterium uptake, HD exchange coupled with mass spectrometry should provide us with a tool to study the states of actin present in solution. HD exchange detected with mass spectrometry was previously used successfully by Chik and co-workers (16Chik J.K. Schriemer D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to assess changes in muscle actin structure due to the G- to F-actin transition and the binding of phallodin to F-actin and of DNase I to G-actin. More recently, the technique has been used to assess conformational changes in the Arp2/3 complex, which contains actin like subunits (17Zencheck W.D. Xiao H. Nolen B.J. Angeletti R.H. Pollard T.D. Almo S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 390: 414-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this study, we used HD exchange detected with mass spectrometry to analyze differences in solution structures of yeast, muscle, sub1, and sub12 G- and F-actins. DNase I (grade D) was purchased from Worthington. DE52 DEAE-cellulose was obtained from Whatman. Rabbit muscle acetone powder was obtained from Pel-Freez. Porcine pepsin was obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals used were of reagent grade quality. Wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae was obtained from a local bakery. Wild type actin from S. cerevisiae and hybrid actins from appropriate strains were purified using DNase I affinity chromatography and DE52 DEAE anion exchange chromatography according to Cook et al. (18Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The actin was then subjected to a round of polymerization-depolymerization. Muscle actin was purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder, as described by Spudich and Watt (19Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified actins in their calcium form were stored at 4 °C in G-buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP) and used within 4 days. To obtain F-actin, polymerization was induced by the addition of 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl to a G-actin sample at room temperature. Before each hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiment, a polymerization assay was performed as described previously (10McKane M. Wen K.K. Meyer A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29916-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to ensure that the actin was active. All HD exchange experiments were performed beginning with calcium actin. A protein sample in the appropriate buffer was diluted in ∼16 times its volume of deuterated buffer. For F-actin samples, concentrations of actin were about 2 or more times critical concentration. Critical concentrations for all actin isoforms used are comparable. Exchange was carried out at room temperature at a pD of 7.5. After certain labeling times, aliquots of ∼300 pmol of protein were taken, and the exchange reaction was quenched by putting the sample in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 2.5, and then by freezing the sample on dry ice. Samples were stored at −80 °C and analyzed by mass spectrometry in the next 2 days. Labeled protein samples were analyzed as described previously (20Wales T.E. Engen J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1592-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled protein samples were injected into a system connected to a pepsin column (21Wang L. Pan H. Smith D.L. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1: 132-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The samples were loaded on the pepsin column with a flow rate of 100 μl/min and, after digestion, loaded on a peptide macrotrap (Michrom Bioresources, Inc.) for desalting. Pepsin digestion and desalting on the macrotrap lasted 6 min with a digestion time on the pepsin column of less than 2 min. The peptides generated were loaded on a Jupiter Proteo C-12 column and eluted in a mass spectrometry instrument with an acetonitrile gradient from 15 to 85% (v/v) in 6 min at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. To eliminate back-exchange, the system with the injectors, peptide macrotrap, C-12 column, and accompanying tubing was immersed in an ice-water bath. The pepsin column was above the ice bath. The mass spectrometer used was an LCQ Deca (Thermo Finnigan) in the University of Iowa High Resolution Mass Spectrometry Facility. The mass spectra obtained were analyzed with the Bioworks Browser and Xcalibur Qual Browser (Thermo Finnigan) to identify the peptides, and the centroid mass of the peaks was determined with MagTran (22Zhang Z. Marshall A.G. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Data were not adjusted for back-exchange, and therefore all changes in masses were reported as uncorrected changes. To examine possible structural and conformational differences between different actin isoforms, we used HD exchange as described above. Good coverage of the actin sequence was achieved with pepsin digestion and subsequent separation steps. For all of the actin isoforms studied, yeast, muscle, sub1, and sub12, depending on the run and the isoform, between 40 and 50 peptides were usually seen, which covers about 82–92% of the sequence. Supplemental Figs. S1–S4 show the yeast, muscle, sub1, and sub12 actin sequences and peptides obtained following pepsin digestion and mass spectrometry analysis. One of the drawbacks of the experimental setup for HD exchange detected with mass spectrometry is that peptide detection can be somewhat stochastic and will not be identical for each run. The result is that some peptides might not be seen in every run. Fig. 1 shows mass spectra of a representative yeast G-actin peptide and its increase in mass with labeling time. The peptide 105–121 has 14 exchangeable amide hydrogens and is a part of a helix and a β sheet located in the back of subdomain 1. For all the samples, labeling times were from 30 s to 3 h. Fig. 2 shows deuterium uptake for a 6-min labeling time for peptides of yeast G- and F-actin. Peptides are divided into several groups based on their change in mass with labeling time calculated as follows,=m1−mu/n×100(Eq. 1) where ml is the mass of the labeled peptide, mu is the mass of the unlabeled peptide, and n is the number of exchangeable amide hydrogens, which is equal to number of peptide bonds minus the number of prolines minus 1. Thus, the percentage exchange of peptide amide hydrogens depicted in our graphs is the change in mass of the total peptide due to deuterium incorporation normalized by the total number of exchangeable amide hydrogens. After 6 min of labeling, most of the molecule shows deuterium uptake of 20–40% for yeast G-actin. Areas that exchange the most (40–60% of their hydrogens exchanged) are located in the bottom of subdomain 1 (peptide residues 347–355, 58% exchanged, one run), top of subdomain 2 (peptide 32–44, 53 ± 2% exchanged; peptide 45–66, 53 ± 15% exchanged), and a helix in subdomain 4 (peptide 222–235, 42% exchanged, one run) that is largely exposed to the solvent. Areas that exhibit the least HD exchange (0–20%) are located throughout the molecule. These include areas that are buried from the solvent, such as the peptide near the N terminus in subdomain 1 (peptide 8–16, 16 ± 1% exchanged), and a β sheet in subdomain 3 (peptide 154–168, 18 ± 2% exchanged). On the other hand, some of the peptides that exhibit very little exchange after 6 min of labeling time are somewhat more exposed to the solvent based on the actin crystal structure. These peptides include part of a helix in subdomain 1 (peptide 83–94, 9 ± 1% exchanged) and two other helices in subdomain 4 (peptide 206–218, 9 ± 3% exchanged; peptide 177–189, 9 ± 2% exchanged). In F-actin, monomers come together to form a double-stranded filament. According to the Holmes actin filament model, subdomains 3 and 4 largely constitute the inside surface of the filament, whereas subdomains 1 and 2 make up the outside filament surface (23Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 24Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Monomer-monomer contacts in the filament include a contact between the top of subdomain 2 of one monomer and the bottom of subdomain 3 of a second. Furthermore, the C terminus and top of subdomain 4 make contacts with the bottom of subdomain 3 of another monomer. Considering the protection from the solvent due to the contacts made between the monomers in one strand of the filament and also between the strands, less HD exchange should be seen with the filament compared with the monomer. Indeed, this is the case, and yeast F-actin incorporates about 13 fewer deuteriums per monomer than G-actin, observed throughout the molecule. As seen in Fig. 2, after 6 min of labeling, peptide 236–261 in subdomain 4 of F-actin exchanges 19 ± 1% of its exchangeable amide hydrogens compared with 30 ± 3% in G-actin. Also, the C terminus peptide 356–375 in subdomain 1 shows 18 ± 4% exchange compared with 25 ± 2% in G-actin. Two more peptides that exhibit exchange levels that were lower for F- compared with G-actin were peptides 268–283 with exchange levels of 26 ± 3% for G-actin and 19 ± 2% for F-actin and peptide 284–299 with exchange levels of 12 ± 2% for G-actin and 29 ± 3% for F-actin. Interestingly, peptide 326–340, located in subdomains 1 and 3 connecting the two subdomains and the two halves of the actin molecule, exchanged 42 ± 3% of its exchangeable amide hydrogens compared with a 37 ± 2% exchange in G-actin. This peptide is the only peptide observed that showed significant increase in exchange in F- compared with G-actin. A more sensitive way to examine the differences between G- and F-actin is to observe exchange within a peptide over multiple time points. Below, peptides referred to are depicted graphically in the figures along with examples of the kinetic data. The remainder of the kinetic data are included in the supplemental material. Supplemental Figs. S3, S5, and S6 show HD exchange with time for peptides that exhibited significant differences in exchange between yeast G- and F-actin. Graphs shown are averages and the ranges of HD experiments performed with two different preparations of actins or averages with S.D. values for HD experiments done with three or more different actin preparations. Specific peptides were judged as showing significant differences in exchange between different forms of actin if the average exchange levels and S.D. values for different forms of actin did not show overlap. Also, the difference was deemed significant if there was a trend exhibited throughout the labeling time. Data presented show change in HD exchange with labeling time for the first 10 min of labeling. For most of the peptide pairs with distinguishable differences, the peptide exchange curves seemed to show more difference in total protons exchanged (intercept) rather than differences in the rates of exchange over time. However, because of nonlinearity in these plots and small apparent differences in slopes if any, we did not actually calculate slope values. For most of the peptides, for labeling times longer than 10 min, there is less of a difference observed between different actin forms. In the nine peptides represented, eight peptides show decreased exchange in F-actin compared with G-actin, and one peptide showed increased exchange in F- versus G-actin. Areas of decreased deuterium exchange in F- versus G-actin include areas that were predicted contacts in the Holmes filament model. These consist of peptides 32–44 and 45–65 of subdomain 2 (supplemental Fig. S5), peptide 356–375 in the C terminus (supplemental Fig. S6), peptide 206–218 in the subdomain 4, and peptides 236–261 (supplemental Fig. S6) and 262–269 in subdomain 4 (Fig. 3). Peptide 105–121 also showed a decrease in exchange in F- compared with G-actin (Fig. 3). This area was not predicted to be involved in monomer-monomer contacts in the Holmes model. However, a segment of this peptide was predicted to make monomer-monomer contacts in a recently published model of the filament by Oda et al. (25Oda T. Iwasa M. Aihara T. Maéda Y. Narita A. Nature. 2009; 457: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The position of this peptide in the context of monomer-monomer contacts in the Oda filament trimer is represented in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 also represents other peptides that show differences in exchange between F- and G-actins and their position in the Oda filament trimer. According to the Holmes or Oda filament models, peptide 95–104 in subdomain 1 should not be masked by involvement in a monomer-monomer interface. Therefore, the G- to F-actin transformation should not decrease the exchange. However, it actually showed less of an exchange in F- versus G-actin (supplemental Fig. 5). On the other hand, peptide 326–340 located between subdomains 1 and 3 showed increased exchange for F-actin for early labeling times (Fig. 3). As mentioned earlier, this is the only peptide that showed increased exchange in F- versus G-actin.FIGURE 4.Representation of the actin filament model of Oda et al. (25Oda T. Iwasa M. Aihara T.

Peptides that we compared are located in the same area of the molecule and have the same number of exchangeable amide hydrogens, although they might have differences in amino acid sequence and in their masses. Peptides that show significant differences between yeast and muscle G-actins are peptides 17–31 and 105–121 located in subdomain 1, peptide 32–44 in subdomain 2, and peptide 143–153 in subdomain 3. In all four cases, the peptide in yeast actin exchanges more than the muscle G-actin peptide (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S7). Interestingly, three of four peptides are located in the smaller domain of the actin molecule. The fourth peptide is located after the hinge helix of subdomain 1 and makes a part of the helix and β sheet that connect the two halves of the protein. Deuterium uptake was compared for yeast and muscle F-actins. As was the case for G-actins, equivalent peptides were compared. Differences are observed with peptides in subdomain 2 peptides 32–44 and 45–65 and in subdomain 4 peptide 236–253. Both areas involve regions where proposed monomer-monomer contacts are made in the Holmes model. In all three peptides, yeast actin exhibits greater exchange compared with muscle actin (Fig. 6 and supplemental Fig. 7). Another peptide that shows greater exchange for yeast compared with muscle actin is peptide 105–121 (Fig. 6). As mentioned previously, amino acids within this peptide are involved in monomer-monomer contacts in the filament model of Oda et al. (25Oda T. Iwasa M. Aihara T. Maéda Y. Narita A. Nature. 2009; 457: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In our previously constructed yeast-muscle hybrid actins, subdomains 3 and 4, are completely from yeast actin, and sub1 and sub12 refer to the subdomains carrying the entire complement of muscle specific residues (10McKane M. Wen K.K. Meyer A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29916-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). If the two halves of actin are allosterically coupled across the nucleotide cleft, the creation of yeast-muscle hybrids might create mismatches resulting in altered interdomain communication. Such a result might be manifested as an alteration in peptide HD exchange patterns. We thus monitored HD exchange for the two hybrid actins. Sub1 and sub12 G-actins show differences in HD exchange compared with yeast G-actin in several peptides located mostly in the smaller (muscle-like) actin domain (Fig. 7 and supplemental Fig. S8). These peptides include 17–31, 83–94, 95–104 (supplemental Fig. S8), and 105–123 in subdomain 1 (Fig. 7), which, as in muscle actin alone, exchange to a lesser extent than in yeast actin. The behavior of peptide 32–44 in subdomain 2 was surprising. This peptide differs between yeast and muscle actin at one position; at position 43, there is a valine in yeast actin compared with isoleucine in muscle actin. Its exchange levels were low, like muscle actin, regardless of whether or not muscle residues are in subdomain 2 (Fig. 7). Another peptide showing a difference in exchange is peptide 143–153 located between subdomains 1 and 3 expanding from the so-called hinge region (8Tirion M.M. ben-Avraham D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In both hybrids, although the sequence is that of yeast actin, the peptide exhibits exchange behavior similar to that of muscle actin (Fig. 7). In the filament, a different type of result was observed. In most of the peptides for which significant differences in exchange occurred, sub1 and sub12 peptides showed higher extents of exchange compared with muscle F-actin (Fig. 8 and supplemental Fig. S9). These peptides include those thought to be involved in monomer-monomer contacts in the filament: peptides 32–44 for both sub1 and sub12 and peptide 45–65 for sub1 in subdomain 2 (Fig. 8 and supplemental Fig. S9). Peptides 206–218 and 200–218 in subdomain 4 also showed higher exchange levels compared with both muscle and yeast F-actins (supplemental Fig. 9). Another peptide of interest is peptide 286–299 located on the bottom of subdomain 3. This peptide, observed in yeast, sub1, and sub12 actin analyses, exhibited increased exchange levels for both hybrids compared with yeast F-actin (supplemental Fig. S9). Peptide 105–121 in subdomain 2 also showed increased levels of exchange compared with muscle F-actin for both hybrids (Fig. 8). Differences were also observed with peptide 68–84 in the area in subdomain 2 involved in ATP binding. This region also contains a histidine at position 73, which is methylated in muscle actin but not in yeast nor in either of the two hybrids, most likely due to the lack of the methylase in yeast (26Kalhor H.R. Niewmierzycka A. Faull K.F. Yao X. Grade S. Clarke S. Rubenstein P.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Peptide 68–84 in subdomain 1 showed increased levels of exchange compared with muscle actin for the sub12 hybrid (Fig. 8). The equivalent peptide was not detected in the yeast actin analysis, and therefore a comparison with yeast actin could not be performed. The focus of this work was to use mass spectroscopic analysis of HD exchange to examine at three different levels the role that conformational differences play in regulation of actin biological function. First, we wished to gain insight into the different conformations assumed by the monomeric versus the filament form of a single actin species. Second, we"
