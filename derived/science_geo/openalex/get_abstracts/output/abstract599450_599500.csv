https://openalex.org/W2770853452,"The 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to make full use of the spatial 3D context information of lung nodules, and the multi-view strategy has been shown to be useful for improving the performance of 2D CNN in classifying lung nodules. In this paper, we explore the classification of lung nodules using the 3D multi-view convolutional neural networks (MV-CNN) with both chain architecture and directed acyclic graph architecture, including 3D Inception and 3D Inception-ResNet. All networks employ the multi-view-one-network strategy. We conduct a binary classification (benign and malignant) and a ternary classification (benign, primary malignant and metastatic malignant) on Computed Tomography (CT) images from Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative database (LIDC-IDRI). All results are obtained via 10-fold cross validation. As regards the MV-CNN with chain architecture, results show that the performance of 3D MV-CNN surpasses that of 2D MV-CNN by a significant margin. Finally, a 3D Inception network achieved an error rate of 4.59% for the binary classification and 7.70% for the ternary classification, both of which represent superior results for the corresponding task. We compare the multi-view-one-network strategy with the one-view-one-network strategy. The results reveal that the multi-view-one-network strategy can achieve a lower error rate than the one-view-one-network strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2949998815,"Rare genetic variants in the core endocannabinoid system genes CNR1, CNR2, DAGLA, MGLL and FAAH were identified in molecular testing data from 6,032 patients with a broad spectrum of neurological disorders. The variants were evaluated for association with phenotypes similar to those observed in the orthologous gene knockouts in mice. Heterozygous rare coding variants in CNR1, which encodes the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1), were found to be significantly associated with pain sensitivity (especially migraine), sleep and memory disorders—alone or in combination with anxiety—compared to a set of controls without such CNR1 variants. Similarly, heterozygous rare variants in DAGLA, which encodes diacylglycerol lipase alpha, were found to be significantly associated with seizures and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and abnormalities of brain morphology, compared to controls. Rare variants in MGLL, FAAH and CNR2 were not associated with any neurological phenotypes in the patients tested. Diacylglycerol lipase alpha synthesizes the endocannabinoid 2-AG in the brain, which interacts with CB1 receptors. The phenotypes associated with rare CNR1 variants are reminiscent of those implicated in the theory of clinical endocannabinoid deficiency syndrome. The severe phenotypes associated with rare DAGLA variants underscore the critical role of rapid 2-AG synthesis and the endocannabinoid system in regulating neurological function and development. Mapping of the variants to the 3D structure of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor, or primary structure of diacylglycerol lipase alpha, reveals clustering of variants in certain structural regions and is consistent with impacts to function."
https://openalex.org/W2768138250,"The burden of arboviruses in the Americas is high and may result in long-term sequelae with infants disabled by Zika virus infection (ZIKV) and arthritis caused by infection with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). We aimed to identify environmental drivers of arbovirus epidemics to predict where the next epidemics will occur and prioritize municipalities for vector control and eventual vaccination. We screened sera and urine samples (n = 10,459) from residents of 48 municipalities in the state of Rio de Janeiro for CHIKV, dengue virus (DENV), and ZIKV by molecular PCR diagnostics. Further, we assessed the spatial pattern of arbovirus incidence at the municipal and neighborhood scales and the timing of epidemics and major rainfall events. Lab-confirmed cases included 1,717 infections with ZIKV (43.8%) and 2,170 with CHIKV (55.4%) and only 29 (<1%) with DENV. ZIKV incidence was greater in neighborhoods with little access to municipal water infrastructure (r = -0.47, p = 1.2x10-8). CHIKV incidence was weakly correlated with urbanization (r = 0.2, p = 0.02). Rains began in October 2015 and were followed one month later by the largest wave of ZIKV epidemic. ZIKV cases markedly declined in February 2016, which coincided with the start of a CHIKV outbreak. Rainfall predicted ZIKV and CHIKV with a lead time of 3 weeks each time. The association between rainfall and epidemics reflects vector ecology as the larval stages of Aedes aegypti require pools of water to develop. The temporal dynamics of ZIKV and CHIKV may be explained by the shorter incubation period of the viruses in the mosquito vector; 2 days for CHIKV versus 10 days for ZIKV."
https://openalex.org/W2769050466,"Antigenic drift of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) influenza virus proteins contributes to reduced vaccine efficacy. To analyze antigenic drift in human seasonal H1N1 viruses derived from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus (pH1N1-like viruses) accounts for the limited effectiveness (around 40%) of vaccination against pH1N1-like viruses during the 2015–2016 season, nasal washes/swabs collected from adult subjects in the Rochester, NY area, were used to sequence and isolate the circulating viruses. The HA and NA proteins from viruses circulating during the 2015–2016 season encoded eighteen and fourteen amino acid differences, respectively, when compared to A/California/04/2009, a strain circulating at the origin of the 2009 pandemic. The circulating strains belonged to subclade 6B.1, defined by HA amino acid substitutions S101N, S179N, and I233T. Hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) and HA-specific neutralizing serum antibody (Ab) titers from around 50% of pH1N1-like virus-infected subjects and immune ferrets were 2–4 fold lower for the 2015–2016 circulating strains compared to the vaccine strain. In addition, using a luminex-based mPlex HA assay, the binding of human sera from subjects infected with pH1N1-like viruses to the HA proteins from circulating and vaccine strains was not identical, strongly suggesting antigenic differences in the HA protein. Additionally, NA inhibition (NAI) Ab titers in human sera from pH1N1-like virus-infected subjects increased after the infection and there were measurable antigenic differences between the NA protein of circulating strains and the vaccine strain using both ferret and human antisera. Despite having been vaccinated, infected subjects exhibited low HAI Ab titers against the vaccine and circulating strains. This suggests that poor responses to the H1N1 component of the vaccine as well as antigenic differences in the HA and NA proteins of currently circulating pH1N1-like viruses could be contributing to risk of infection even after vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2770020092,"The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cell therapy and regenerative medicine has received widespread attention over the past few years, but their application can be complicated by factors such as reduction in proliferation potential, the senescent tendency of the MSCs upon expansion and their age-dependent decline in number and function. It was shown that all the mentioned features were accompanied by a reduction in telomerase activity and telomere shortening. Furthermore, the role of epigenetic changes in aging, especially changes in promoter methylation, was reported. In this study, MSCs were isolated from the adipose tissue with enzymatic digestion. In addition, immunocytochemistry staining and flow cytometric analysis were performed to investigate the cell-surface markers. In addition, alizarin red-S, sudan III, toluidine blue, and cresyl violet staining were performed to evaluate the multi-lineage differentiation of hADSCs. In order to improve the effective application of MSCs, these cells were treated with 1.5 × 10-8 and 2.99 × 10-10 M of ZnSO4 for 48 hours. The length of the absolute telomere, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene expression, telomerase activity, the investigation of methylation status of the hTERT gene promoter and the percentage of senescent cells were analyzed with quantitative real-time PCR, PCR-ELISA TRAP assay, methylation specific PCR (MSP), and beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, respectively. The results showed that the telomere length, the hTERT gene expression, and the telomerase activity had significantly increased. In addition, the percentage of senescent cells had significantly decreased and changes in the methylation status of the CpG islands in the hTERT promoter region under treatment with ZnSO4 were seen. In conclusion, it seems that ZnSO4 as a proper antioxidant could improve the aging-related features due to lengthening of the telomeres, increasing the telomerase gene expression, telomerase activity, decreasing aging, and changing the methylation status of hTERT promoter; it could potentially beneficial for enhancing the application of aged-MSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2770207577,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of non-surgical periodontal treatment on hemoglobinA1c (HbA1c) levels, oxidative stress balance and quality of life (QOL) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to no periodontal treatment (simple oral hygiene instructions only).The design was a 6-month, single-masked, single center, randomized clinical trial. Patients had both T2DM and chronic periodontitis. Forty participants were enrolled between April 2014 and March 2016 at the Nephrology, Diabetology and Endocrinology Department of Okayama University Hospital. The periodontal treatment group (n = 20) received non-surgical periodontal therapy, including scaling and root planing plus oral hygiene instructions, and consecutive supportive periodontal therapy at 3 and 6 months. The control group (n = 17) received only oral hygiene instructions without treatment during the experimental period. The primary study outcome was the change in HbA1c levels from baseline to 3 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in oxidative stress balance (Oxidative-INDEX), the Diabetes Therapy-Related QOL and clinical periodontal parameters from baseline to 3 months and baseline to 6 months.Changes in HbA1c in the periodontal treatment group were not significantly different with those in the control group at 3 and 6 months. Systemic oxidative stress balance and QOL significantly improved in the periodontal treatment group compared to the control group at 3 months. In the subgroup analysis (moderately poor control of diabetes), the decrease in HbA1c levels in the periodontal treatment group was greater than that in the control group at 3 months but not significant.In T2DM patients, non-surgical periodontal treatment improved systemic oxidative stress balance and QOL, but did not decrease HbA1c levels at 3 months follow-up.Current Controlled Trials UMIN-ICDR UMIN 000013278 (Registered April 1, 2014)."
https://openalex.org/W2770699896,"Food consumption accounts for an important proportion of the world GHG emissions per capita. Previous studies have delved into the nature of dietary patterns, showing that GHG reductions can be achieved in diets if certain foods are consumed rather than other, more GHG intensive products. For instance, vegetarian and low-meat diets have proved to be less carbon intensive than diets that are based on ruminant meat. These environmental patterns, increasingly analyzed in developed nations, are yet to be assessed in countries liked Peru where food purchase represents a relatively high percentage of the average household expenditure, ranging from 38% to 51% of the same. Therefore, food consumption can be identified as a potential way to reduce GHG emissions in Peru. However, the Peruvian government lacks a specific strategy to mitigate emissions in this sector, despite the recent ratification of the Paris Accord. In view of this, the main objective of this study is to analyze the environmental impacts of a set of 47 Peruvian food diet profiles, including geographical and socioeconomic scenarios. In order to do this, Life Cycle Assessment was used as the methodological framework to obtain the overall impacts of the components in the dietary patterns observed and primary data linked to the composition of diets were collected from the Peruvian National Institute for Statistics (INEI). Life cycle inventories for the different products that are part of the Peruvian diet were obtained from a set of previous scientific articles and reports regarding food production. Results were computed using the IPCC 2013 assessment method to estimate GHG emissions. Despite variations in GHG emissions from a geographical perspective, no significant differences were observed between cities located in the three Peruvian natural regions (i.e., coast, Andes and Amazon basin). In contrast, there appears to be a strong, positive correlation between GHG emissions and social expenditure or academic status. When compared to GHG emissions computed in the literature for developed nations, where the average caloric intake is substantially higher, diet-related emissions in Peru were in the low range. Our results could be used as a baseline for policy support to align nutritional and health policies in Peru with the need to reduce the environmental impacts linked to food production."
https://openalex.org/W2768239016,"Long-term exposure to polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been connected to chronic human health disorders. It is also well-known that i) PAH contamination alters soil bacterial communities, ii) human microbiome is associated with environmental microbiome, and iii) alteration in the abundance of members in several bacterial phyla is associated with adverse or beneficial human health effects. We hypothesized that soil pollution by PAHs altered soil bacterial communities that had known associations with human health. The rationale behind our study was to increase understanding and potentially facilitate reconsidering factors that lead to health disorders in areas characterized by PAH contamination. Large containers filled with either spruce forest soil, pine forest soil, peat, or glacial sand were left to incubate or contaminated with creosote. Biological degradation of PAHs was monitored using GC-MS, and the bacterial community composition was analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing. Proteobacteria had higher and Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes had lower relative abundance in creosote contaminated soils than in non-contaminated soils. Earlier studies have demonstrated that an increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased abundance of the phyla Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes are particularly associated with adverse health outcomes and immunological disorders. Therefore, we propose that pollution-induced shifts in natural soil bacterial community, like in PAH-polluted areas, can contribute to the prevalence of chronic diseases. We encourage studies that simultaneously address the classic “adverse toxin effect” paradigm and our novel “altered environmental microbiome” hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2769235191,"Identifying which species are at greatest risk, what makes them vulnerable, and where they are distributed are central goals for conservation science. While knowledge of which factors influence extinction risk is increasingly available for some taxonomic groups, a deeper understanding of extinction correlates and the geography of risk remains lacking. Here, we develop a predictive random forest model using both geospatial and mammalian species’ trait data to uncover the statistical and geographic distributions of extinction correlates. We also explore how this geography of risk may change under a rapidly warming climate. We found distinctive macroecological relationships between species-level risk and extinction correlates, including the intrinsic biological traits of geographic range size, body size and taxonomy, and extrinsic geographic settings such as seasonality, habitat type, land use and human population density. Each extinction correlate exhibited ranges of values that were especially associated with risk, and the importance of different risk factors was not geographically uniform across the globe. We also found that about 10% of mammals not currently recognized as at-risk have biological traits and occur in environments that predispose them towards extinction. Southeast Asia had the most actually and potentially threatened species, underscoring the urgent need for conservation in this region. Additionally, nearly 40% of currently threatened species were predicted to experience rapid climate change at 0.5 km/year or more. Biological and environmental correlates of mammalian extinction risk exhibit distinct statistical and geographic distributions. These results provide insight into species-level patterns and processes underlying geographic variation in extinction risk. They also offer guidance for future conservation research focused on specific geographic regions, or evaluating the degree to which species-level patterns mirror spatial variation in the pressures faced by populations within the ranges of individual species. The added impacts from climate change may increase the susceptibility of at-risk species to extinction and expand the regions where mammals are most vulnerable globally."
https://openalex.org/W2770675495,"Background The role of serum TSH concentrations as a predictor of malignancy of thyroid nodule remains unclear. Objective To prospectively evaluate the usefulness of serum TSH levels as a predictor of malignancy in thyroid nodules. Methods Patients with thyroid nodule(s) who underwent fine-needle aspiration biopsy under ultrasonographic guidance in a tertiary, university-based hospital were consecutively evaluated. Patients with known thyroid cancer and/or patients receiving thyroid medication were excluded. Serum TSH levels were measured by two differents methodologies, chemiluminescent (CLIA) and electrochemiluminscent immunoassay (ECLIA). Anatomopathological exam of tissue samples obtained at thyroidectomy was considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Results A total of 615 patients participated in the study. The mean age was 55.9±14.7 years, and 544(88.5%) were female. The median TSH values were 1.48 and 1.55 μU/mL, using CLIA and ECLIA, respectively. One-hundred-sixty patients underwent thyroidectomy and the final diagnoses were malignant in 47(29.4%) patients. TSH levels were higher in patients with malignant than in those with benign nodules in both TSH assays: 2.25 vs. 1.50; P = 0.04 (CLIA) and 2.33 vs. 1.27; P = 0.03 (ECLIA). Further analysis using binary logistic regression identified elevated TSH levels, a family history of thyroid cancer, the presence of microcalcifications, and solitary nodule on US as independent risk factors for malignancy in patients with thyroid nodules. Additional analyses using TSH levels as a categorical variable, defined by ROC curve analysis, showed that the risk of malignancy was approximately 3-fold higher in patients with TSH levels ≥2.26 μU/mL than in patients with lower TSH levels (P = 0.00). Conclusions Higher serum TSH levels are associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer in patients with thyroid nodules. Using TSH levels as an adjunctive diagnostic test for stratifying the risk of malignancy associated with a thyroid nodule may help on defining the best therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2769862178,"Stone cleavers are one of the most distinctive components of the Acheulian toolkit. These tools were produced as part of a long and complex reduction sequence and they provide indications for planning and remarkable knapping skill. These aspects hold implications regarding the cognitive complexity and abilities of their makers and users. In this study we have analyzed a cleaver assemblage originating from the Acheulian site of Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov, Israel, to provide a reconstruction of the chaîne opératoire which structured their production. This reduction sequence was taken as the basis for a cognitive analysis which allowed us to draw conclusion regarding numerous behavioral and cognitive aspects of the GBY hominins. The results indicate that the cleavers production incorporated a highly specific sequence of decisions and actions which resulted in three distinct modes of cleavers modification. Furthermore, the decision to produce a cleaver must have been taken very early in the sequence, thus differentiating its production from that of handaxes. The substantial predetermination and the specific reduction sequence provide evidence that the Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov hominins had a number of cognitive categories such as a general ‘tool concept’ and a more specific ‘cleaver concept’, setting them apart from earlier tool-producing hominins and extant tool-using non-human primates. Furthermore, it appears that the Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov lithic technology was governed by expert cognition, which is the kind of thinking typical of modern human experts in their various domains. Thus, the results provide direct indications that important components of modern cognition have been well established in the minds of the Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov hominins."
https://openalex.org/W2768224243,"Fibrosing diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and, therefore, there is a need for safe and effective antifibrotic therapies. Adenosine, generated extracellularly by the dephosphorylation of adenine nucleotides, ligates specific receptors which play a critical role in development of hepatic and dermal fibrosis. Results of recent clinical trials indicate that tenofovir, a widely used antiviral agent, reverses hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. Belonging to the class of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, tenofovir is an analogue of AMP. We tested the hypothesis that tenofovir has direct antifibrotic effects in vivo by interfering with adenosine pathways of fibrosis using two distinct models of adenosine and A2AR-mediated fibrosis.Thioacetamide (100mg/kg IP)-treated mice were treated with vehicle, or tenofovir (75mg/kg, SubQ) (n = 5-10). Bleomycin (0.25U, SubQ)-treated mice were treated with vehicle or tenofovir (75mg/kg, IP) (n = 5-10). Adenosine levels were determined by HPLC, and ATP release was quantitated as luciferase-dependent bioluminescence. Skin breaking strength was analysed and H&E and picrosirus red-stained slides were imaged. Pannexin-1expression was knocked down following retroviral-mediated expression of of Pannexin-1-specific or scrambled siRNA.Treatment of mice with tenofovir diminished adenosine release from the skin of bleomycin-treated mice and the liver of thioacetamide-treated mice, models of diffuse skin fibrosis and hepatic cirrhosis, respectively. More importantly, tenofovir treatment diminished skin and liver fibrosis in these models. Tenofovir diminished extracellular adenosine concentrations by inhibiting, in a dose-dependent fashion, cellular ATP release but not in cells lacking Pannexin-1.These studies suggest that tenofovir, a widely used antiviral agent, could be useful in the treatment of fibrosing diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2770458268,"The viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) of influenza A virus is formed by virion RNA (vRNA), viral polymerase complex, and nucleoprotein (NP). The NP plays an important role in facilitating the replication and stabilization of viral RNA. To explore host factors that may be involved in the regulation of viral replication through interactions with NP, we conducted an immunoprecipitation experiment followed by mass spectrometry to identify NP-associated cellular proteins. Here, we demonstrate that NP can interact and colocalize with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/B1 in mammalian cells and that the interaction may occur via direct binding to the glycine-rich domain (GRD) of hnRNP A2/B1. In addition, two residues in the tail loop of NP, F412 and R422, are required for the interaction of hnRNP A2/B1. Because the knockdown of hnRNP A2/B1 expression reduces viral RNP activity, hnRNP A2/B1 may act as a positive regulator in viral RNA synthesis of influenza A virus. More importantly, the findings in this research demonstrate that host proteins can regulate the replication of influenza A virus by interacting with NP."
https://openalex.org/W2768657394,"Mycoremediation is an on-site remediation strategy, which employs fungi to degrade or sequester contaminants from the environment. The present work focused on the bioremediation of soils contaminated with zinc by the use of a native mycorrhizal fungi (AM) called Funneliformis geosporum (Nicol. & Gerd.) Walker & Schüßler. Experiments were performed using Triticum aestivum L. cv. Gemmeza-10 at different concentrations of Zn (50, 100, 200 mg kg-1) and inoculated with or without F. geosporum. The results showed that the dry weight of mycorrhizal wheat increased at Zn stressed plants as compared to the non-Zn-stressed control plants. The concentrations of Zn also had an inhibitory effect on the yield of dry root and shoot of non-mycorrhizal wheat. The photosynthetic pigment fractions were significantly affected by Zn treatments and mycorrhizal inoculation, where in all treatments, the content of the photosynthetic pigment fractions decreased as the Zn concentration increased in the soil. However, the level of minerals of shoots, roots, and grains was greatly influenced by Zn-treatment and by inoculation with F. geosporum. Treatment with Zn in the soil increased Cu and Zn concentrations in the root, shoot and grains, however, other minerals (P, S, K, Ca and Fe) concentration was decreased. Inoculation of wheat with AM fungi significantly reduced the accumulation of Zn and depressed its translocation in shoots and grains of wheat. In conclusion, inoculation with a native F. geosporum-improves yields of wheat under higher levels of Zn and is possible to be applied for the improvement of zinc contaminated soil."
https://openalex.org/W2768195443,"Background Systemic inflammation and coagulopathy are major drivers of injury progression following hemorrhagic trauma. Our aim was to examine the effect of small-volume 3% NaCl adenosine, lidocaine and Mg2+ (ALM) bolus and 0.9% NaCl/ALM ‘drip’ on inflammation and coagulation in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock. Methods Sprague-Dawley rats (429±4 g) were randomly assigned to: 1) shams, 2) no-treatment, 3) saline-controls, 4) ALM-therapy, and 5) Hextend®. Hemorrhage was induced in anesthetized-ventilated animals by liver resection (60% left lateral lobe and 50% medial lobe). After 15 min, a bolus of 3% NaCl ± ALM (0.7 ml/kg) was administered intravenously (Phase 1) followed 60 min later by 4 hour infusion of 0.9% NaCl ± ALM (0.5 ml/kg/hour) with 1-hour monitoring (Phase 2). Plasma cytokines were measured on Magpix® and coagulation using Stago/Rotational Thromboelastometry. Results After Phase 1, saline-controls, no-treatment and Hextend® groups showed significant falls in white and red cells, hemoglobin and hematocrit (up to 30%), whereas ALM animals had similar values to shams (9–15% losses). After Phase 2, these deficits in non-ALM groups were accompanied by profound systemic inflammation. In contrast, after Phase 1 ALM-treated animals had undetectable plasma levels of IL-1α and IL-1β, and IL-2, IL-6 and TNF-α were below baseline, and after Phase 2 they were less or similar to shams. Non-ALM groups (except shams) also lost their ability to aggregate platelets, had lower plasma fibrinogen levels, and were hypocoagulable. ALM-treated animals had 50-fold higher ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and 9.3-times higher collagen-induced aggregation compared to saline-controls, and had little or no coagulopathy with significantly higher fibrinogen shifting towards baseline. Hextend® had poor outcomes. Conclusions Small-volume ALM bolus/drip mounted a frontline defense against non-compressible traumatic hemorrhage by defending immune cell numbers, suppressing systemic inflammation, improving platelet aggregation and correcting coagulopathy. Saline-controls were equivalent to no-treatment. Possible mechanisms of ALM's immune-bolstering effect are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2768995350,"Reports of mass coral mortality from disease have increased over the last two decades. Montipora white syndrome (MWS) is a tissue loss disease that has negatively impacted populations of the coral Montipora capitata in Kāne‘ohe Bay, Hawai‘i. Two types of MWS have been documented; a progressive disease termed chronic MWS (cMWS), that can be caused by Vibrio owensii strain OCN002, and a comparatively faster disease termed acute MWS (aMWS), that can be caused by Vibrio coralliilyticus strain OCN008. M. capitata colonies exhibiting cMWS can spontaneously switch to aMWS in the field. In this study, a novel Pseudoalteromonas species, P. piratica strain OCN003, fulfilled Koch’s postulates of disease causation as another etiological agent of aMWS. Additionally, OCN003 induced a switch from cMWS to aMWS on M. capitata in laboratory infection trials. A comparison of OCN003 and Vibrio coralliilyticus strain OCN008, showed that OCN003 was more effective at inducing the cMWS to aMWS switch in M. capitata than OCN008. This study is the first to demonstrate that similar disease signs on one coral species (aMWS on M. capitata) can be caused by multiple pathogens, and describes the first Pseudoalteromonas species that infects coral."
https://openalex.org/W2768986231,"The activity of the GH1 β-glucosidase from Humicola insolens (Bglhi) against p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (pNP-Glc) and cellobiose is enhanced 2-fold by glucose and/or xylose. Kinetic and transglycosylation data showed that hydrolysis is preferred in the absence of monosaccharides. Stimulation involves allosteric interactions, increased transglycosylation and competition of the substrate and monosaccharides for the -1 glycone and the +1/+2 aglycone binding sites. Protein directed evolution has been used to generate 6 mutants of Bglhi with altered stimulation patterns. All mutants contain one of three substitutions (N235S, D237V or H307Y) clustered around the +1/+2 aglycone binding sites. Two mutants with the H307Y substitution preferentially followed the transglycosylation route in the absence of xylose or glucose. The strong stimulation of their pNP-glucosidase and cellobiase activities was accompanied by increased transglycosylation and higher monosaccharide tolerance. The D237V mutation favoured hydrolysis over transglycosylation and the pNP-glucosidase activity, but not the cellobiase activity, was stimulated by xylose. The substitution N235S abolished the preference for hydrolysis or transglycosylation; the cellobiase, but not the pNP-glucosidase activity of the mutants was strongly inhibited by xylose. Both the D237V and N235S mutations lowered tolerance to the monosaccharides. These results provide evidence that the fine modulation of the activity of Bglhi and mutants by glucose and/or xylose is regulated by the relative affinities of the glycone and aglycone binding sites for the substrate and the free monosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2769068784,"Nest ventilation in the leaf-cutting ant Atta vollenweideri is driven via a wind-induced mechanism. On their nests, workers construct small turrets that are expected to facilitate nest ventilation. We hypothesized that the construction and structural features of the turrets would depend on the colony’s current demands for ventilation and thus might be influenced by the prevailing environmental conditions inside the nest. Therefore, we tested whether climate-related parameters, namely airflow, air humidity and CO2 levels in the outflowing nest air influenced turret construction in Atta vollenweideri. In the laboratory, we simulated a semi-natural nest arrangement with fungus chambers, a central ventilation tunnel providing outflow of air and an aboveground building arena for turret construction. In independent series, different climatic conditions inside the ventilation tunnel were experimentally generated, and after 24 hours, several features of the built turret were quantified, i.e., mass, height, number and surface area (aperture) of turret openings. Turret mass and height were similar in all experiments even when no airflow was provided in the ventilation tunnel. However, elevated CO2 levels led to the construction of a turret with several minor openings and a larger total aperture. This effect was statistically significant at higher CO2 levels of 5% and 10% but not at 1% CO2. The construction of a turret with several minor openings did not depend on the strong differences in CO2 levels between the outflowing and the outside air, since workers also built permeated turrets even when the CO2 levels inside and outside were both similarly high. We propose that the construction of turrets with several openings and larger opening surface area might facilitate the removal of CO2 from the underground nest structure and could therefore be involved in the control of nest climate in leaf-cutting ants."
https://openalex.org/W2769509152,"Hepatic dysfunction is a feature of dengue virus (DENV) infection. Hepatic biopsy specimens obtained from fatal cases of DENV infection show apoptosis, which relates to the pathogenesis of DENV infection. However, how DENV induced liver injury is not fully understood. In this study, we aim to identify the factors that influence cell death by employing an apoptosis-related siRNA library screening. Our results show the effect of 558 gene silencing on caspase 3-mediated apoptosis in DENV-infected Huh7 cells. The majority of genes that contributed to apoptosis were the apoptosis-related kinase enzymes. Tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 12 (TNFSF12), and sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2), were selected as the candidate genes to further validate their influences on DENV-induced apoptosis. Transfection of siRNA targeting SPHK2 but not TNFSF12 genes reduced apoptosis determined by Annexin V/PI staining. Knockdown of SPHK2 did not reduce caspase 8 activity; however, did significantly reduce caspase 9 activity, suggesting its involvement of SPHK2 in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Treatment of ABC294649, an inhibitor of SPHK2, reduced the caspase 3 activity, suggesting the involvement of its kinase activity in apoptosis. Knockdown of SPHK2 significantly reduced caspase 3 activity not only in DENV-infected Huh7 cells but also in DENV-infected HepG2 cells. Our results were consistent across all of the four serotypes of DENV infection, which supports the pro-apoptotic role of SPHK2 in DENV-infected liver cells."

It represents part of an interdisciplinary program seeking to address chronic undernutrition in children through improvements to existing poultry and crop systems. Newcastle disease vaccination uptake was found to vary substantially across communities and seasons, with a significantly higher level of vaccination amongst households participating in a longitudinal study of children's growth compared with non-participating households (p = 0.009). Two multivariable model analyses were used to explore associations between vaccination and chicken numbers, allowing for clustered data and socioeconomic and cultural variation amongst the population. Results demonstrated that both (a) households that undertook ND vaccination had a significantly larger chicken flock size in the period between that vaccination campaign and the next compared with those that did not vaccinate (p = 0.018); and (b) households with larger chicken flocks at the time of vaccination were significantly more likely to participate in vaccination programs (p < 0.001). Additionally, households vaccinating in all three vaccination campaigns held over 12 months were identified to have significantly larger chicken flocks at the end of this period (p < 0.001). Opportunities to understand causality and complexity through quantitative analyses are limited, and there is a role for qualitative approaches to explore decisions made by poultry-keeping households and the motivations, challenges and priorities of community vaccinators. Evidence of a bi-directional relationship, however, whereby vaccination leads to greater chicken numbers, and larger flocks are more likely to be vaccinated, offers useful insights into the efficacy of fee-for-service animal health programs. This article concludes that attention should be focused on ways of supporting the participation of vulnerable households in ND vaccination campaigns, and encouraging regular vaccination throughout the year, as a pathway to strengthen food security, promote resilience and contribute to improved human nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2770978914,"Background Mortality from TB continues to be a global public health challenge. TB ranks alongside Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) as the leading infectious causes of death globally. HIV is a major driver of TB related morbidity and mortality while TB is the leading cause of mortality among people living with HIV/AIDS. We sought to determine excess mortality associated with HIV and the effect of antiretroviral therapy on reducing mortality among tuberculosis patients in Kenya. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of Kenya national tuberculosis program data of patients enrolled from 2013 through 2014. We used direct standardization to obtain standardized mortality ratios for tuberculosis patients compared with the general population. We calculated the population attributable fraction of tuberculosis deaths due to HIV based on the standardized mortality ratio for deaths among TB patients with HIV compared to TB patients without HIV. We used Cox proportional hazards regression for assessing risk factors for mortality. Results Of 162,014 patients included in the analysis, 6% died. Mortality was 10.6 (95% CI: 10.4–10.8) times higher among TB patients than the general population; 42% of deaths were attributable to HIV infection. Patients with HIV who were not receiving ART had an over four-fold risk of death compared to patients without HIV (aHR = 4.2, 95% CI 3.9–4.6). In contrast, patients with HIV who were receiving ART had only 2.6 times the risk of death (aHR = 2.6, 95% CI 2.5–2.7). Conclusion HIV was a significant contributor to TB-associated deaths in Kenya. Mortality among HIV-infected individuals was higher among those not on ART than those on ART. Early initiation of ART among HIV infected people (a “test and treat” approach) should further reduce TB-associated deaths."
https://openalex.org/W2769213270,"Inflammation is associated with every health condition, and is an important component of many pathologies such as cardiovascular diseases. Circulating levels of soluble endoglin have been shown to be higher in the serum of patients with cardiovascular diseases with a significant inflammatory component. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implication of circulating soluble endoglin in the inflammatory response. For this purpose, a transgenic mouse expressing human soluble endoglin (sEng+) was employed, and three different inflammatory approaches were used to mimic inflammatory conditions in different tissues. This study shows that control sEng+ mice have a normal inflammatory state. The lung and kidney injury induced by the inflammatory agents was reduced in sEng+ mice, especially the intra-alveolar and kidney infiltrates, suggesting a possible reduction in inflammation induced by soluble endoglin. To deepen into this possible effect, the leukocyte number in the bronchoalveolar lavage and air pouch lavage was evaluated and a significant reduction of neutrophil infiltration in LPS-treated lungs and ischemic kidneys from sEng+ with respect to WT mice was observed. Additionally, the mechanisms through which soluble endoglin prevents inflammation were studied. We found that in sEng+ animals the increment of proinflammatory cytokines, TNFα, IL1β and IL6, induced by the inflammatory stimulus was reduced. Soluble endoglin also prevents the augmented adhesion molecules, ICAM, VCAM and E-selectin induced by the inflammatory stimulus. In addition, vascular permeability increased by inflammatory agents was also reduced by soluble endoglin. These results suggest that soluble endoglin modulates inflammatory-related diseases and open new perspectives leading to the development of novel and targeted approaches for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2769458674,"The combination of 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) and metam sodium (MNa) is a potential resource to replace methyl bromide (MB) as a soil fumigant. The efficacy of 1,3-D+MNa as a crucial factor to limit soil-borne pests was evaluated in one laboratory experiment and two cucumber greenhouse studies conducted in commercial operations. Laboratory results revealed that 1,3-D and MNa (10+20 mg a.i. kg−1 soil) provided the best complementary control of the root-knot nematode, Fusarium oxysporum and two species of weed seeds. Greenhouse trials revealed that the blend of 1,3-D and MNa (10+20 g a.i. m−2) greatly inhibited the ability of Meloidogyne incognita to form root galls. In addition, the number of colony-forming units of F. oxysporum declined substantially after growth on media, resulting in higher fruit yields and greater economic benefits. The combined use of 1,3-D and MNa exhibited a higher control efficacy than when 1,3-D or MNa was utilized alone. The ability of this chemical combination to control soil-borne organisms did not differ significantly from the MB treatment and maintained high cucumber yields, enhancing the income of the farmers. Compared to the untreated control group, all the chemical treatments prominently improved the control of the pests. These results show that applying a combination of 1,3-D and MNa provides a promising alternative to MB that enables the sustained growth of cucumber production in China."
https://openalex.org/W2770868400,"Soybean (Glycine max) is one of the major crops worldwide and flooding stress affects the production and expansion of cultivated areas. Oxygen is essential for mitochondrial aerobic respiration to supply the energy demand of plant cells. Because oxygen diffusion in water is 10,000 times lower than in air, partial (hypoxic) or total (anoxic) oxygen deficiency is important component of flooding. Even when oxygen is externally available, oxygen deficiency frequently occurs in bulky, dense or metabolically active tissues such as phloem, meristems, seeds, and fruits. In this study, we analyzed conserved and divergent root transcriptional responses between flood-tolerant Embrapa 45 and flood-sensitive BR 4 soybean cultivars under hypoxic stress conditions with RNA-seq. To understand how soybean genes evolve and respond to hypoxia, stable and differentially expressed genes were characterized structurally and compositionally comparing its mechanistic relationship. Between cultivars, Embrapa 45 showed less up- and more down-regulated genes, and stronger induction of phosphoglucomutase (Glyma05g34790), unknown protein related to N-terminal protein myristoylation (Glyma06g03430), protein suppressor of phyA-105 (Glyma06g37080), and fibrillin (Glyma10g32620). RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis of non-symbiotic hemoglobin (Glyma11g12980) indicated divergence in gene structure between cultivars. Transcriptional changes for genes in amino acids and derivative metabolic process suggest involvement of amino acids metabolism in tRNA modifications, translation accuracy/efficiency, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in both cultivars under hypoxia. Gene groups differed in promoter TATA box, ABREs (ABA-responsive elements), and CRT/DREs (C-repeat/dehydration-responsive elements) frequency. Gene groups also differed in structure, composition, and codon usage, indicating biological significances. Additional data suggests that cis-acting ABRE elements can mediate gene expression independent of ABA in soybean roots under hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2768459679,"Though many methods can be used to identify cell types contained in complex tissues, most require cell disaggregation and destroy information about where cells reside in relation to their microenvironment. Here, we describe a polytomous key for cell type identification in intact sections of adult mouse prostate and prostatic urethra. The key is organized as a decision tree and initiates with one round of immunostaining for nerve, epithelial, fibromuscular/hematolymphoid, or vascular associated cells. Cell identities are recursively eliminated by subsequent staining events until the remaining pool of potential cell types can be distinguished by direct comparison to other cells. We validated our identification key using wild type adult mouse prostate and urethra tissue sections and it currently resolves sixteen distinct cell populations which include three nerve fiber types as well as four epithelial, five fibromuscular/hematolymphoid, one nerve-associated, and three vascular-associated cell types. We demonstrate two uses of this novel identification methodology. We first used the identification key to characterize prostate stromal cell type changes in response to constitutive phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase activation in prostate epithelium. We then used the key to map cell lineages in a new reporter mouse strain driven by Wnt10aem1(cre/ERT2)Amc. The identification key facilitates rigorous and reproducible cell identification in prostate tissue sections and can be expanded to resolve additional cell types as new antibodies and other resources become available."
https://openalex.org/W2768481429,"Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), an endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor, has been shown to control a Ca2+-dependent signal that promotes cardiac hypertrophy. However, whether STIM1 has adaptive role that helps to protect against cardiac overload stress remains unknown. We hypothesized that STIM1 deficiency causes a maladaptive response to pressure overload stress. We investigated STIM1 heterozygous KO (STIM1+/–) mice hearts, in which STIM1 protein levels decreased to 27% of wild-type (WT) with no compensatory increase in STIM2. Under stress-free conditions, no significant differences were observed in electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters or blood pressure between STIM1+/–and WT mice. However, when STIM1+/–mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC), STIM1+/–mice had a higher mortality rate than WT mice. The TAC-induced increase in the heart weight to body weight ratio (mean mg/g ± standard error of the mean) was significantly inhibited in STIM1+/–mice (WT sham, 4.12 ± 0.14; WT TAC, 6.23 ± 0.40; STIM1+/–sham, 4.53 ± 0.16; STIM1+/–TAC, 4.63 ± 0.08). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of the left ventricles of TAC-treated STIM1+/–mice showed inhibited induction of cardiac fetal genes, including those encoding brain and atrial natriuretic proteins. Western blot analysis showed upregulated expression of transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1) in TAC-treated WT mice, but suppressed expression in TAC-treated STIM1+/–mice. Taken together, the hearts of STIM1 haploinsufficient mice had a superficial resemblance to the WT phenotype under stress-free conditions; however, STIM1 haploinsufficient mice showed a maladaptive response to cardiac pressure overload."
https://openalex.org/W2768648985,"Nanoparticles represent promising gene delivery systems in biomedicine to facilitate prolonged gene expression with low toxicity compared to viral vectors. Specifically, nanoparticles of calcium phosphate (nCaP), the main inorganic component of human bone, exhibit high biocompatibility and good biodegradability and have been reported to have high affinity for protein or DNA, having thus been used as gene transfer vectors. On the other hand, Octa-arginine (R8), which has a high permeability to cell membrane, has been reported to improve intracellular delivery systems. Here, we present an optimized method for nCaP-mediated gene delivery using an octa-arginine (R8)-functionalized nCaP vector containing a marker or functional gene construct. nCaP particle size was between 220–580 nm in diameter and all R8-functionalized nCaPs carried a positive charge. R8 concentration significantly improved nCaP transfection efficiency with high cell compatibility in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) and human osteoblasts (hOB) in particular, suggesting nCaPs as a good option for non-viral vector gene delivery. Furthermore, pre-treatment with different endocytosis inhibitors identified that the endocytic pathway differed among cell lines and functionalized nanoparticles, with amiloride increasing transfection efficiency of R8-functionalized nCaPs in hMSC and hOB."
https://openalex.org/W2769618658,"θ-defensins constitute a family of macrocyclic peptides expressed exclusively in Old World monkeys. The peptides are pleiotropic effectors of innate immunity, possessing broad spectrum antimicrobial activities and immunoregulatory properties. Here we report that rhesus θ-defensin 1 (RTD-1) is highly effective in arresting and reversing joint disease in a rodent model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Parenteral RTD-1 treatment of DA/OlaHsd rats with established pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) rapidly suppressed joint disease progression, restored limb mobility, and preserved normal joint architecture. RTD-1 significantly reduced joint IL-1β levels compared with controls. RTD-1 dose-dependently inhibited fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) invasiveness and FLS IL-6 production. Consistent with the inhibition of FLS invasiveness, RTD-1 was a potent inhibitor of arthritogenic proteases including ADAMs 17 and 10 which activate TNFα, and inhibited matrix metalloproteases, and cathepsin K. RTD-1 was non-toxic, non-immunogenic, and effective when administered as infrequently as once every five days. Thus θ-defensins, which are absent in humans, have potential as retroevolutionary biologics for the treatment of RA."

However, little is known about its formation in emergent Candida species involved in catheter-related infections. Thus, various techniques may be used in the biofilm detection to elucidate structure and clinical impact. In this context, we report the ability of emergent Candida species (Candida haemulonii, C. lusitaniae, C. pelliculosa, C.guilliermondii, C. famata and C. ciferrii) on developing well structured biofilms with cell viability and architecture, using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This new approach was compared with XTT analyses and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). A positive correlation between oxidative activity (XTT) and OCT results (r = 0.8752, p < 0.0001) was observed. SEM images demonstrated cells attachment, multilayer and morphologic characteristics of the biofilm structure. C. lusitaniae was the emergent species which revealed the highest scattering extension length and oxidative metabolism when evaluated by OCT and XTT methods, respectively. Herein, information on C. ciferri biofilm structure were presented for the first time. The OCT results are independently among Candida strains and no species-specific pattern was observed. Our findings strongly contribute for clinical management based on the knowledge of pathogenicity mechanisms involving emergent yeasts."
https://openalex.org/W2770388791,"Running agility is required for many sports and other physical tasks that demand rapid changes in body direction. Quantifying agility skill remains a challenge because measuring rapid changes of direction and quantifying agility skill from those measurements are difficult to do in ways that replicate real task/game play situations. The objectives of this study were to define and to measure agility performance for a (five-cone) agility drill used within a military obstacle course using data harvested from two foot-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs). Thirty-two recreational athletes ran an agility drill while wearing two IMUs secured to the tops of their athletic shoes. The recorded acceleration and angular rates yield estimates of the trajectories, velocities and accelerations of both feet as well as an estimate of the horizontal velocity of the body mass center. Four agility performance metrics were proposed and studied including: 1) agility drill time, 2) horizontal body speed, 3) foot trajectory turning radius, and 4) tangential body acceleration. Additionally, the average horizontal ground reaction during each footfall was estimated. We hypothesized that shorter agility drill performance time would be observed with small turning radii and large tangential acceleration ranges and body speeds. Kruskal-Wallis and mean rank post-hoc statistical analyses revealed that shorter agility drill performance times were observed with smaller turning radii and larger tangential acceleration ranges and body speeds, as hypothesized. Moreover, measurements revealed the strategies that distinguish high versus low performers. Relative to low performers, high performers used sharper turns, larger changes in body speed (larger tangential acceleration ranges), and shorter duration footfalls that generated larger horizontal ground reactions during the turn phases. Overall, this study advances the use of foot-mounted IMUs to quantify agility performance in contextually-relevant settings (e.g., field of play, training facilities, obstacle courses, etc.)."
https://openalex.org/W2769928372,"The development of mesencephalic dopamine neurons and their survival later in life requires the continuous presence of the transcription factor Nurr1 (NR4A2). Nurr1 belongs to the nuclear receptors superfamily. However, it is an orphan member that does not require a ligand to regulate the transcription of its target genes. Therefore, controlling the expression of Nurr1 is an important manner to control its function. Several reports have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate Nurr1 expression. However, Nurr1 has several splicing variants, posing the question what variants are subjected to miRNA regulation. In this work, we identified a long 3'UTR variant of rat Nurr1 mRNA. We used bioinformatics analysis to identify miRNAs with the potential to regulate Nurr1 expression. Reporter assays performed with the luciferase gene fused to the short (658 bp) or long (1,339 bp) 3'UTR of rat Nurr1 mRNAs, showed that miR-93, miR-204 and miR-302d selectively regulate the mRNA with the longest 3'UTR. We found that the longest variant of Nurr1 mRNA expresses in the rat mesencephalon as assessed by PCR. The transfection of rat mesencephalic neurons with mixed miR-93, miR-204 and miR-302d resulted in a significant reduction of Nurr1 protein levels. In conclusion, Nurr1 mRNA variant with the longest 3'UTR undergoes a specific regulation by miRNAs. It is discussed the importance of fine-tuning Nurr1 protein levels in mesencephalic dopamine neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2770400157,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5-HT) is recognized as a neurotransmitter in the central nerve system and as a regulator of systemic blood pressure in the peripheral tissues. Recently, it was reported that 5-HT2 receptors (5-HT2Rs) were expressed in cartilage tissues lacking both vessels and neurons, suggesting possible novel functions of 5-HT during cartilage development and regeneration. Our previous data indicated that CCN family protein 2/connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/CTGF) plays a central role in cartilage development and regeneration. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 5-HT on the production of CCN2 in chondrocytes. Firstly, we showed that the mRNAs of 5-HT2R subtypes 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2BR, were expressed in a human chondrocytic cell line, HCS-2/8; however, 5-HT2CR mRNA was not detected. In addition, exogenously added 5-HT did not affect the 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2BR expressions. Next, we demonstrated that CCN2 production was increased by treatment with a 5-HT2AR agonist and the combination of 5-HT and 5-HT2BR antagonist. In contrast, treatment with a 5-HT2BR agonist and the combination of 5-HT and 5-HT2AR antagonist decreased CCN2 production. Furthermore, we showed that phosphorylation of Akt and p38 MAPK were increased by treatment with 5-HT2AR agonist, and that phosphorylation of PKCε, PKCζ, ERK1/2 and JNK were increased by treatment with 5-HT2BR agonist. Finally, we found that 5-HT2AR was localized in the growth plate, whereas 5-HT2BR was localized in the articular cartilage. These findings suggest that 5-HT promotes CCN2 production through the 5-HT2AR in growth plates, and that it represses CCN2 production through the 5-HT2BR in articular cartilage for harmonized development of long bones."
https://openalex.org/W2768406667,"Introduction Hospital-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (HA-MRSA) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We conducted a study to determine risk factors for HA-MRSA in order to inform control strategies in South Africa. Methods We used surveillance data collected from five tertiary hospitals in Gauteng and Western Cape provinces during 2014 for analysis. A case of HA-MRSA was defined as isolation of MRSA from a blood culture 48 hours after admission and/or if the patient was hospitalised in the six months prior to the current culture. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to determine risk factors for HA-MRSA. Results Of the 9971 patients with positive blood cultures, 7.7% (772) had S. aureus bacteraemia (SAB). The overall prevalence of MRSA among those with SAB was 30.9% (231/747; 95% confidence interval [CI] 27.6%– 34.3%). HA-MRSA infections accounted for 28.3% of patients with SAB (207/731; 95% CI 25.1%– 31.7%). Burns (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 12.7; 95% CI 4.7–34.4), age ≤1 month (aOR 8.7; 95% CI 3.0–24.6), residency at a long-term care facility (aOR 5.2; 95% CI, 1.5–17.4), antibiotic use within two months of the current SAB episode (aOR 5.1; 95% CI 2.8–9.1), hospital stay of 13 days or more (aOR 2.8; 95% CI 1.3–5.6) and mechanical ventilation (aOR 2.2; 95% CI 1.07–4.6), were independent risk factors for HA-MRSA infection. Conclusion The prevalence of MRSA remains high in South African tertiary public hospitals. Several identified risk factors of HA-MRSA infections should be considered when instituting infection and prevention strategies in public-sector hospitals, including intensifying the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programmes. There is an urgent need to strengthen infection prevention and control in burn wards, neonatal wards, and intensive care units which house mechanically ventilated patients."

This experimental study was performed to investigate the effect of posture on cardiac and respiratory related impedance changes. Methods EIT measurements were performed on 14 healthy subjects in left-, right lateral, prone, supine and upright positions. Simultaneously, tidal volume was recorded with an ultrasonic flowmeter. For image reconstruction, the classic Sheffield back-projection and three variants of the modern GREIT algorithm were applied with two different reference frames. Amplitudes of cardiac- and respiratory impedance changes were extracted and compared between the positions. Results We found significant differences in both cardiac and respiratory amplitudes between postures. Especially, supine and upright positions showed dramatic changes in amplitude. These differences between postures were unaffected by the change of reference frames in all reconstruction methods except of the classic Sheffield back projection. Possible sources that explain the observed posture dependency are discussed. Conclusion Researchers and clinicians need to be aware of this phenomenon when comparing EIT amplitudes in different body positions."
https://openalex.org/W2769058218,"Mapping three-dimensional (3D) surface deformation caused by an earthquake is very important for the environmental, cultural, economic and social sustainability of human beings. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems made it possible to measure precise 3D deformations by combining SAR interferometry (InSAR) and multiple aperture interferometry (MAI). In this paper, we retrieve the 3D surface deformation field of the 2010 Haiti earthquake which occurred on January 12, 2010 by a magnitude 7.0 Mw by using the advanced interferometric technique that integrates InSAR and MAI data. The surface deformation has been observed by previous researchers using the InSAR and GPS method, but 3D deformation has not been measured yet due to low interferometric coherence. The combination of InSAR and MAI were applied to the ALOS PALSAR ascending and descending pairs, and were validated with the GPS in-situ measurements. The archived measurement accuracy was as little as 1.85, 5.49 and 3.08 cm in the east, north and up directions, respectively. This result indicates that the InSAR/MAI-derived 3D deformations are well matched with the GPS deformations. The 3D deformations are expected to allow us to improve estimation of the area affected by the 2010 Haiti earthquake."
https://openalex.org/W2770724521,"Aquaculture accounts for almost one-half of global fish consumption. Understanding the regional impact of climate fluctuations on aquaculture production thus is critical for the sustainability of this crucial food resource. The objective of this work was to understand the role of climate fluctuations and climate change in subtropical coastal estuarine environments within the context of aquaculture practices in He'eia Fishpond, O'ahu Island, Hawai'i. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study of climate effects on traditional aquaculture systems in the Hawaiian Islands. Data from adjacent weather stations were analyzed together with in situ water quality instrument deployments spanning a 12-year period (November 2004 -November 2016). We found correlations between two periods with extremely high fish mortality at He'eia Fishpond (May and October 2009) and slackening trade winds in the week preceding each mortality event, as well as surface water temperatures elevated 2-3°C higher than the background periods (March-December 2009). We posit that the lack of trade wind-driven surface water mixing enhanced surface heating and stratification of the water column, leading to hypoxic conditions and stress on fish populations, which had limited ability to move within net pen enclosures. Elevated water temperature and interruption of trade winds previously have been linked to the onset of El Niño in Hawai'i. Our results provide empirical evidence regarding El Niño effects on the coastal ocean, which can inform resource management efforts about potential impact of climate variation on aquaculture production. Finally, we provide recommendations for reducing the impact of warming events on fishponds, as these events are predicted to increase in magnitude and frequency as a consequence of global warming."
https://openalex.org/W2770150715,"B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein which plays a role as a molecular chaperone for the newly synthesized transmembrane proteins. BAP31 is also an important apoptosis regulator for extrinsic apoptosis induction in the ER membrane. Recent studies have shown that BAP31 is also expressed on the surface of embryonic stem cells. However, the function of cell surface BAP31 (csBAP31) still remains unclarified. In an attempt to search for surface markers on tumorspheres, here, we generated monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the sphere cells from the non-small cell lung carcinoma cell (NSCLC) line A549. SP1-B7, one of the MAbs, recognized csBAP31 whose expression was further increased on A549 sphere cells, as compared with A549 adherent cells. To investigate the role of csBAP31 in A549 cells, A549 adherent and sphere cells were stained with annexin V, propidium iodide, and SP1-B7. Interestingly, annexin V-high cells showed increased expression of csBAP31 as compared with annexin V-low cells. Caspase-3/7 activity was also increased in csBAP31-high cells as compared with csBAP31-low cells, suggesting that csBAP31-high cells are more sensitive to apoptosis. To further demonstrate the survival of csBAP31-positive A549 cells, csBAP31-positive and -negative A549 cells were sorted and subjected to the clonogenic survival assay. The colony number of csBAP31-positive A549 cells was decreased by approximately 1.7-fold, as compared that of csBAP31-negative A549 cells, suggesting that csBAP31-positve cells are sensitive to cell death indeed. The results suggest that enhanced expression of csBAP31 contributes to poor survival of NSCLC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2770680923,"Introduction Prophylactic administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) is the standard treatment for controlling hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT). Since lifelong use of HBIG is expensive and inconvenient and the antibodies level in anti-hepatitis B surface (HBs) is not sustainable and stable, an alternative strategy is to produce anti-HBs antibodies by active immunization. Our present study aimed to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of procedural HBV vaccination in transplanted patients. Methods Recipients who had undergone LT for hepatitis B related liver diseases more than one year before, with no evidence of HBV recurrence or rejection and normal liver function were enrolled. All subjects received the hepatitis B vaccine (40 μg) by intramuscular injection at months 0, 1, 2, 6 and 12 after enrollment with continuous administration of NAs. The liver function and anti-HBs titers were measured before each vaccination and HBIG (400U) was administrated intramuscularly when anti-HBs titer was lower than 30 IU/L during the course. The results of routine blood tests, liver function, concentration of immunosuppressant, and HBV-DNA copies were monitored during the research. After completion of the vaccination procedure, recipients were regarded as responders if their anti-HBs greater than 30 IU/L were maintained for up to six months without using HBIG and vaccine. Results Twenty-seven patients were enrolled in this study and the average anti-HBs titer before vaccination was 19.86±14.80 IU/L. The average anti-HBs titer of the nine responders at the end of the follow-up was 57.14±22.75 IU/L, giving an overall response rate of 33.3% (9/27). There were no reports of reactivation of HBV, rejection, severe anaphylaxis or other adverse events. Responders and non-responders showed their significant difference in anti-HBs titers after the fourth vaccination (P<0.01). Moreover, the majority of non-responders (11/18, 63.64%) had high LY/EO rates (lymphocyte number/eosinophil number>15) while most responders (8/9, 88.89%) had low LY/EO rates at the beginning of vaccination (P = 0.019). Conclusions Active immunization is an effective, cost-saving, and safe method for the prevention of HBV reactivation in patients transplanted for hepatitis B virus related liver diseases. The LY/EO rate may be a valuable indicator in selecting potential recipients for vaccination."

In the visual system, neurophysiological studies in nonhuman primates show quite mature neuronal properties near birth although visual function is itself quite immature and continues to develop over many months or years after birth. Our goal was to assess the relative development of two main visual processing streams, dorsal and ventral, using BOLD fMRI in an attempt to understand the global mechanisms that support the maturation of visual behavior. Seven infant macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were repeatedly scanned, while anesthetized, over an age range of 102 to 1431 days. Large rotating checkerboard stimuli induced BOLD activation in visual cortices at early ages. Additionally we used static and dynamic Glass pattern stimuli to probe BOLD responses in primary visual cortex and two extrastriate areas: V4 and MT-V5. The resulting activations were analyzed with standard GLM and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approaches. We analyzed three contrasts: Glass pattern present/absent, static/dynamic Glass pattern presentation, and structured/random Glass pattern form. For both GLM and MVPA approaches, robust coherent BOLD activation appeared relatively late in comparison to the maturation of known neuronal properties and the development of behavioral sensitivity to Glass patterns. Robust differential activity to Glass pattern present/absent and dynamic/static stimulus presentation appeared first in V1, followed by V4 and MT-V5 at older ages; there was no reliable distinction between the two extrastriate areas. A similar pattern of results was obtained with the two analysis methods, although MVPA analysis showed reliable differential responses emerging at later ages than GLM. Although BOLD responses to large visual stimuli are detectable, our results with more refined stimuli indicate that global BOLD activity changes as behavioral performance matures. This reflects an hierarchical development of the visual pathways. Since fMRI BOLD reflects neural activity on a population level, our results indicate that, although individual neurons might be adult-like, a longer maturation process takes place on a population level."

Underlying this process is osteoblastic signalling within the vessel wall involving complex and interlinked roles for receptor-activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). RANKL promotes vascular cell osteoblastic differentiation, whilst OPG acts as a neutralizing decoy receptor for RANKL (and TRAIL). With respect to TRAIL, much recent evidence points to a vasoprotective role for this ligand, albeit via unknown mechanisms. In order to shed more light on TRAILs vasoprotective role therefore, we employed in vitro cell models to test the hypothesis that TRAIL can counteract the RANKL-mediated signalling that occurs between the vascular cells that comprise the vessel wall.Human aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cell mono-cultures (HAECs, HASMCs) were treated with RANKL (0-25 ng/mL ± 5 ng/mL TRAIL) for 72 hr. Furthermore, to better recapitulate the paracrine signalling that exists between endothelial and smooth muscle cells within the vessel wall, non-contact transwell HAEC:HASMC co-cultures were also employed and involved RANKL treatment of HAECs (±TRAIL), subsequently followed by analysis of pro-calcific markers in the underlying subluminal HASMCs. RANKL elicited robust osteoblastic signalling across both mono- and co-culture models (e.g. increased BMP-2, alkaline phosphatase/ALP, Runx2, and Sox9, in conjunction with decreased OPG). Importantly, several RANKL actions (e.g. increased BMP-2 release from mono-cultured HAECs or increased ALP/Sox9 levels in co-cultured HASMCs) could be strongly blocked by co-incubation with TRAIL. In summary, this paper clearly demonstrates that RANKL can elicit pro-osteoblastic signalling in HAECs and HASMCs both directly and across paracrine signalling axes. Moreover, within these contexts we present clear evidence that TRAIL can block several key signalling actions of RANKL in vascular cells, providing further evidence of its vasoprotective potential."
https://openalex.org/W2770274465,"Estimation of the stress distribution in ferromagnetic components is very important for evaluating the working status of mechanical equipment and implementing preventive maintenance. Eddy current testing technology is a promising method in this field because of its advantages of safety, no need of coupling agent, etc. In order to reduce the cost of eddy current stress measurement system, and obtain the stress distribution in ferromagnetic materials without scanning, a low cost eddy current stress measurement system based on Archimedes spiral planar coil was established, and a method based on BP neural network to obtain the stress distribution using the stress of several discrete test points was proposed. To verify the performance of the developed test system and the validity of the proposed method, experiment was implemented using structural steel (Q235) specimens. Standard curves of sensors at each test point were achieved, the calibrated data were used to establish the BP neural network model for approximating the stress variation on the specimen surface, and the stress distribution curve of the specimen was obtained by interpolating with the established model. The results show that there is a good linear relationship between the change of signal modulus and the stress in most elastic range of the specimen, and the established system can detect the change in stress with a theoretical average sensitivity of -0.4228 mV/MPa. The obtained stress distribution curve is well consonant with the theoretical analysis result. At last, possible causes and improving methods of problems appeared in the results were discussed. This research has important significance for reducing the cost of eddy current stress measurement system, and advancing the engineering application of eddy current stress testing."
https://openalex.org/W2770354714,"Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequently observed in serious infections, following nephrotoxic medication, surgery and trauma. Here we tested whether the detection of two recently identified biomarkers for AKI, Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 7 (IGFBP7), depends on the expression of these proteins in cells of the urinary sediment. Method We collected urine samples of 33 kidney transplant recipients and 14 non-transplanted patients who all had AKI (stages 1–3 according to KDIGO), and measured [IGFBP7]x[TIMP-2] using the NephroCheck® Astute1 40 ™ meter. Concomitantly, we analyzed IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 mRNA expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) from urinary sediment of the same patients, and correlated the results with [IGFBP7]x[TIMP-2] (protein), by linear regression analysis. We also determined the association between [IGFBP7]x[TIMP-2] and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and between IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 mRNA expression and markers of inflammation. Light microscopy and confocal immunofluorescence served to illustrate changes in the urinary sediment over the time course of renal function improvement. Results Of the 47 analyzed AKI patients, 14 presented with ascending urinary tract infection. Serum creatinine (sCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and eGFR in all patients were 3.9±2.28 mg/dL, 47.59±23.1 mg/dL and 22.88±16.0 mL/min/1.73m2, respectively, on average ±standard deviation. [IGFBP7]x[TIMP-2] was 2.33±9.95 (ng/ml)2/1000, and did not associate with IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 gene expression (r = -0.0220, p = 0.4216; respectively r = 0.0972, p = 0.1909). [IGFBP7]x[TIMP-2] did not associate with eGFR; IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 mRNA expression. Improvement of renal function went along with disappearance of casts, decrease in aquaporin1 positive renal epithelial cells and leukocytes from the urinary sediment. Conclusion The gene expression pattern of IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 from urinary sediment, which contains desquamated renal tubular epithelial cells, did not correlate with [IGFBP7]x[TIMP-2] protein, indicating that IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 measured in the NephroCheck® test originated predominantly from intact but stressed cells of the kidney itself."
https://openalex.org/W2768314114,"The orexins and their cognate G-protein coupled receptors have been widely studied due to their associations with various behaviors and cellular processes. However, the detailed downstream signaling cascades that mediate these effects are not completely understood. We report the generation of a neuronal model cell line that stably expresses the OX1 orexin receptor (OX1) and an RNA-Seq analysis of changes in gene expression seen upon receptor activation. Upon treatment with orexin, several families of related transcription factors are transcriptionally regulated, including the early growth response genes (Egr), the Kruppel-like factors (Klf), and the Nr4a subgroup of nuclear hormone receptors. Furthermore, some of the transcriptional effects observed have also been seen in data from in vivo sleep deprivation microarray studies, supporting the physiological relevance of the data set. Additionally, inhibition of one of the most highly regulated genes, serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (Sgk1), resulted in the diminished orexin-dependent induction of a subset of genes. These results provide new insight into the molecular signaling events that occur during OX1 signaling and support a role for orexin signaling in the stimulation of wakefulness during sleep deprivation studies."
https://openalex.org/W2768383532,"Noise in housing environments may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); however, the most significant sources of noise among elderly individuals remain poorly understood. A nationwide cross-sectional study comprised of 6,181 elderly people (age ≥ 65 years) was conducted using a web-based self-reported questionnaire in 2014. Questions pertaining to CVD-related subjective symptoms within the past year addressed symptoms of chest pain, disturbances in pulse, acute impaired tongue movement, limb paralysis, and foot pain or numbness during walking. Questions concerning noise included awakening during the night due to noise, automobile, neighborhood, construction, railway, and aircraft noise. The multivariable analyses revealed that all symptoms were significantly associated with awakening during the night due to noise. Automobile, construction, railway, and aircraft noise were significantly associated with more CVD-related symptoms at nighttime than at daytime. Our results suggest that noise at nighttime is an important risk factor for CVDs. Although several different sources of environmental noise, including automobile, neighborhood, construction, railway, and aircraft noise were found to be significantly associated with CVD-related symptoms, the strongest association was observed for construction noise, followed by neighborhood and automobile noise. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for construction noise at nighttime were 1.12 (1.06-1.19) with disturbances in pulse, 1.21 (1.08-1.35) in acute impaired tongue movement, 1.25 (1.15-1.36) in limb paralysis, and 1.19 (1.12-1.28) in foot pain or numbness during walking. The associations with railway and aircraft noise were found to be weaker than those with automobile, neighborhood, and construction noise. Our study suggests that CVD-related symptoms may exhibit a greater association with construction, neighborhood, and automobile noise than with railway and aircraft noise."
https://openalex.org/W2769046439,"In this study, the association estimators, which have significant influences on the gene network inference methods and used for determining the molecular interactions, were examined within the co-expression network inference concept. By using the proteomic data from five different cancer types, the hub genes/proteins within the disease-associated gene-gene/protein-protein interaction sub networks were identified. Proteomic data from various cancer types is collected from The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA). Correlation and mutual information (MI) based nine association estimators that are commonly used in the literature, were compared in this study. As the gold standard to measure the association estimators’ performance, a multi-layer data integration platform on gene-disease associations (DisGeNET) and the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) was used. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the performance of the association estimators by comparing the created co-expression networks with the disease-associated pathways. It was observed that the MI based estimators provided more successful results than the Pearson and Spearman correlation approaches, which are used in the estimation of biological networks in the weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) package. In correlation-based methods, the best average success rate for five cancer types was 60%, while in MI-based methods the average success ratio was 71% for James-Stein Shrinkage (Shrink) and 64% for Schurmann-Grassberger (SG) association estimator, respectively. Moreover, the hub genes and the inferred sub networks are presented for the consideration of researchers and experimentalists."
https://openalex.org/W2769469762,"Formal techniques have been devoted to analyzing whether network protocol specifications violate security policies; however, these methods cannot detect vulnerabilities in the implementations of the network protocols themselves. Symbolic execution can be used to analyze the paths of the network protocol implementations, but for stateful network protocols, it is difficult to reach the deep states of the protocol. This paper proposes a novel model-guided approach to detect vulnerabilities in network protocol implementations. Our method first abstracts a finite state machine (FSM) model, then utilizes the model to guide the symbolic execution. This approach achieves high coverage of both the code and the protocol states. The proposed method is implemented and applied to test numerous real-world network protocol implementations. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is more effective than traditional fuzzing methods such as SPIKE at detecting vulnerabilities in the deep states of network protocol implementations."
https://openalex.org/W2770410252,"It has been suggested that disruption of the lymphoid niche by G-CSF may be of therapeutic benefit to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We used a xenograft model to determine the effect of G-CSF on ALL progression in a minimal residual disease setting. Consistent with the effects on normal murine B cell progenitors, G-CSF slowed disease in the majority of ALL xenografts tested, suggesting that G-CSF may provide benefits beyond neutrophil recovery for ALL patients. However, two of eight xenografts demonstrated accelerated disease progression. G-CSF could be detrimental for these patients due to expansion of the malignant clone."
https://openalex.org/W2769467618,"Although it is known that the prevalence of obesity is high in deprived patients, the link between deprivation and obesity, and the impact of deprivation on compliance and efficacy of a lifestyle intervention program are not known.Deprivation was assessed in 40 patients (23 Females, mean±SD age: 49±17 years) from the diabetology department and 140 patients (101 Females, age: 50±15 years) from the nutrition department of Bordeaux University hospital. Eighty-seven patients suffering from obesity were evaluated before and after a tailored, multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention. Deprivation was assessed using EPICES scores. Deprivation was defined with an EPICES score > 30.Deprived patients suffering from obesity had significantly higher current (43.8 ±8.4 versus 40.9 ± 5.5 kg/m2, p = 0,02) and maximal BMI (46.1± 8.6 versus 42.3± 5.2 kg/m2, p = 0.002) compared to non-deprived obese. Percentage of body weight loss was not different according to deprivation (4.74 ± 0.75 versus 4.65 ± 1.04%, p = 0.9). EPICES scores were not different according to adherence to lifestyle intervention program (20.5 ± 8.5 versus 29.9 ± 3.9 versus 29.0 ±2.5, no follow up versus partial follow up versus total follow up, p = 0,58).Deprived patients suffering from obesity have a more serious disease than non-deprived patients. However, neither compliance to the lifestyle intervention program nor body weight loss differed between deprived patients with obesity and non-deprived ones. Deprivation should not be a limitation when enrolling patients with obesity in lifestyle intervention programs."
https://openalex.org/W2770638337,"A new, faster and more reliable analytical methodology for S(IV) species analysis at low pH solutions by bichromatometry is proposed. For decades the state of the art methodology has been iodometry that is still well justified method for neutral solutions, thus at low pH media possess various side reactions increasing inaccuracy. In contrast, the new methodology has no side reactions at low pH media, requires only one titration step and provides a clear color change if S(IV) species are present in the solution. The method is validated using model solutions with known concentrations and applied to analyses of gaseous SO2 from purged solution in low pH media samples. The results indicate that bichromatometry can accurately analyze SO2 from liquid samples having pH even below 0 relevant to metallurgical industrial processes."

Exposure to beryllium may lead to granuloma formation and fibrosis in those who develop chronic beryllium disease (CBD). Although disease presentation varies from mild to severe, little is known about CBD phenotypes. This study characterized CBD disease phenotypes using longitudinal measures of lung function.


Methods 
Using a case-only study of 207 CBD subjects, subject-specific trajectories over time were estimated from longitudinal pulmonary function and exercise-tolerance tests. To estimate linear combinations of the 30-year values that define underlying patterns of lung function, we conducted factor analysis. Cluster analysis was then performed on all the predicted lung function values at 30 years. These estimates were used to identify underlying features and subgroups of CBD.


Results 
Two factors, or composite measures, explained nearly 70% of the co-variation among the tests; one factor represented pulmonary function in addition to oxygen consumption and workload during exercise, while the second factor represented exercise tests related to gas exchange. Factors were associated with granulomas on biopsy, exposure, steroid use and lung inflammation. Three clusters of patients (n = 53, n = 59 and, n = 95) were identified based on the collection of test values. Lower levels of each of the factor composite scores and cluster membership were associated with baseline characteristics of patients.


Conclusions 
Using factor analysis and cluster analysis, we identified disease phenotypes that were associated with baseline patient characteristics, suggesting that CBD is a heterogeneous disease with varying severity. These clinical tools may be used in future basic and clinical studies to help define the mechanisms and risk factors for disease severity."
