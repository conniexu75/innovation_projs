https://openalex.org/W1497990315,"Abstract Rates of sterol synthesis from acetate and the levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity (HMG-CoA reductase, EC 1.1.1.3.4) in liver cell cultures and in L cells were strongly inhibited by highly purified preparations of 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, and 7-keto-cholesterol. These steroids specifically diminished the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase without altering rates of acetate metabolism to CO2 or fatty acids, or rates of protein and RNA synthesis. The inhibitory activities of these steroids were associated with specific structural features which included the 7-ketone or 7-hydroxyl functions. The following steroids did not inhibit sterol synthesis significantly under the test conditions employed: purified cholesterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol, 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, pregnenolone, cholestane, cholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid. 3-Keto-Δ4-cholesten-7α-ol inhibited sterol synthesis slightly but did not depress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity. Other steroid preparations (cholestanol, cholestan-3-one, and cholest-4-en-3-one) appeared to be weakly inhibitory when they were added to liver cell cultures at relatively high concentrations. Sterol synthesis in L cells was more sensitive to inhibitory steroids than was that in liver cells, although primary liver cell cultures took up more [4-14C]cholesterol from the medium than did L cells or long term liver cell cultures. Measurements of the inhibitory activities of fractions isolated from impure cholesterol and from a mixture of preputial gland sterols by thin layer chromatography suggest that there are other inhibitors of sterol synthesis not yet identified."

Less than lethal concentrations inhibit cell growth. Over a broad concentration range, the effects of adenosine are prevented by providing a suitable pyrimidine source.

https://openalex.org/W1584046144,"Abstract A simple reproducible procedure has been developed for the large scale isolation of bovine factor X and prothrombin in highly purified states. Both proteins isolated by this method show a single component in four different electrophoretic systems. The specific activity of prothrombin obtained by this procedure is 1300 ± 100 NIH thrombin units per mg of prothrombin, whereas the specific activity of factor X is 90 ± 10 units of activated factor X (factor Xa) per mg of factor X, when assayed by the standard technique (Bachmann, F., Duckert, F., and Koller, F. (1958) Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 2, 24). The over-all yields of bovine prothrombin and factor X are 70 mg and 4.5 mg, respectively, per liter of starting plasma. The isolation procedure involves adsorption of factor X and prothrombin on to barium citrate, their elution from the barium citrate complex with EDTA, extensive dialysis against 0.02 m trisodium citrate and 0.9% sodium chloride, ammonium sulfate fractionation, diisopropylfluorophosphate treatment, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. DEAE-cellulose chromatography in (sodium) citrate buffer at pH 6.0 effectively and completely separates prothrombin from factor X. Factor X is then further purified by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. Both proteins are completely stable in 50% glycerol-H2O (v/v) at -20° for at least 18 months. The molecular weights of bovine prothrombin and factor X as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis are 72,000 ± 4,000 and 56,000 ± 2,000, respectively. The molecular weight of native factor X, determined by sedimentation equilibrium, is 59,000 ± 2,000. Factor X protein is composed of two chains of 44,000 and 15,500 daltons as determined by gel filtration of the reduced and S-carboxymethylated protein in 6 m guanidinium chloride. Activation of factor X by trypsin insolubilized on polyacrylamide produced a trypsin-free factor Xa(factor Xa(trypsin)) with a maximum yield of 750 ± 50 units of factor Xa per mg of factor X, which is 8 times higher than the yield obtainable by the action of Russell's viper venom (RVV) on factor X. Activation of prothrombin by factor Xa(trypsin), has been carried out under conditions in which the possibility of thrombin contamination has been eliminated. The rate of the factor Xa(trypsin) catalyzed activation of prothrombin is accelerated 50-fold in the presence of Ca2+ and 90-fold in the presence of both Ca2+ and phospholipid. However, under all conditions studied, and all types of factor Xa (factor Xa(trypsin, RVV, citrate)) used, the products of prothrombin activation are the same and electrophoretically equivalent to those described previously by this laboratory (Mann, K. G., Heldebrant, C. M., and Fass, D. N. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 6106)."
https://openalex.org/W1556440714,"Abstract Regulation of fatty acid utilization was studied in the isolated, perfused rat heart. The effects of increasing the concentration of perfusate fatty acid and the level of ventricular pressure development on the rates of fatty acid uptake and oxidation and on the tissue levels of CoA and carnitine derivatives were determined. In hearts that were developing low levels of ventricular pressure, the rate of palmitate uptake was proportional to its concentration in the perfusate as the concentration was raised from 0 to 0.6 mm bound to 3% albumin. The faster rate of uptake was associated with only a slight increase in the tissue content of long chain acyl-CoA, acylcarnitine, acetyl-CoA, and acetylcarnitine. Palmitate utilization appeared to be limited by the rate of fatty acid uptake or activation. As the concentration of palmitate was increased from 0.6 to 1.2 mm, the rate of uptake did not increase further; oxygen consumption and 14CO2 production from [U-14C]palmitate increased only slightly, and large amounts of acyl-CoA and acylcarnitine derivatives accumulated in the tissue. These observations indicated that the rate of fatty acid uptake at high levels of exogenous palmitate was limited by the rate of acetyl-CoA oxidation through the citric acid cycle. Fatty acid activation and transfer of the acyl unit from acyl-CoA to acylcarnitine may have been limited by high acetyl-CoA to CoA and acetylcarnitine to carnitine ratios. It was estimated that the concentration of CoA and carnitine decreased to below the level needed for optimal rates of fatty acid activation and oxidation. The mass-action ratio for the carnitine palmityltransferase was constant and independent of the exogenous fatty acid concentration. The mass-action ratio for the carnitine acetyltransferase was shifted toward acetyl-CoA formation as the level of palmitate was raised. A possible role of the carnitine acetyltransferase system in coupling the rate of flux through the citric acid cycle with fatty acid activation and acyl transfer is discussed. Increased ventricular pressure development resulted in (a) a faster rate of oxidative phosphorylation as indicated by increased oxygen consumption (b) an acceleration of the citric acid cycle as indicated by a large increase in CO2 production, and (c) an increase in uptake and β oxidation of palmitate. Acceleration of the citric acid cycle was associated with a decrease in the tissue content of fatty acids, acyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, and acetylcarnitine and an increase in the levels of acylcarnitine, free CoA, and free carnitine. When high levels of exogenous palmitate were present, the increase in CoA and carnitine could have accelerated the rates of fatty acid activation and acyl transfer from acyl-CoA to acylcarnitine and thus increased the rate of palmitate uptake. With concentrations of palmitate below 0.6 mm, the changes in CoA and carnitine were probably too small to account for the increased fatty acid uptake. The tissue content of long chain acylcarnitine increased with acceleration of oxidative metabolism even though the levels of both acyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA decreased. The mass-action ratio for the carnitine palmityltransferase system shifted toward acylcarnitine formation. In contrast to palmitate, oxidation of octanoate was fast enough to maintain high levels of acetyl-CoA when fatty acid oxidation was accelerated by increased cardiac work. These results suggested that the rate of translocation of acyl units across the inner mitochondrial membrane limited the rate of long chain fatty acylcarnitine oxidation at high levels of ventricular pressure development."

https://openalex.org/W1486918793,"Abstract Initial velocities of energy-dependent Ca++ uptake were measured in rat liver mitochondria by stopped flow techniques and dual wave length spectroscopy in the presence of the Ca++ indicator murexide. The initial rate of energy-dependent Ca++ uptake by mitochondria was 0.1 to 0.3 nmole per s per mg of protein at 5 to 15 µm Ca++, and increased to 8.2 nmoles of Ca++ per s per mg at 200 µm Ca++. When initial rates of Ca++ uptake by mitochondria were plotted against the Ca++ concentration in the medium, a sigmoidal curve was obtained in which half-maximal rate of Ca++ transport occurred at Ca++ concentration of 55 to 70 µm. A Hill plot of the data yields a straight line with slope, n, of 1.63. Comparable values of Ca++ transport were obtained when Ca++ was added to mitochondria oxidizing either succinate or glutamate and malate. Similar sigmoidicity was shown with Mn++ uptake; however the maximal rate of accumulation was 3.8 nmoles of Mn++ per s per mg of protein and the half-maximal rate was reached at 170 µm Mn++. A model, which takes into account previous and present data, is presented for the uptake of Ca++ and Mn++ in liver mitochondria. The results obtained and the proposed mechanism are discussed in terms of the physiological regulation of cellular [Ca++] homeostasis in liver cells."
https://openalex.org/W2047789135,"During tail-flip escape responses of crayfish, synaptic transmission at the habituation-prone synapses of the lateral giant reflex pathway is presynaptically inhibited. This prevents transmitter release and all subsequent postsynaptic actions and spares the reflex from becoming habituated to stimuli produced by an animal's own escape movements. These observations demonstrate the existence of a control circuit whose adaptive function is to regulate the malleability of inherently plastic synapses. They also suggest that regulation of plasticity could be a common use of presynaptic inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1997466270,"alpha-Ketoglutaramate, a deaminated metabolite of glutamine not previously identified in biological tissues, was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid of human subjects and found to be increased three- to tenfold in patients with hepatic coma. When perfused into the cerebral lateral ventricles of rats, alpha-ketoglutaramate (10 mM) depressed the animals' nocturnal locomotor activity, and at higher doses induced circling behavior and myoclonus. The concentration of alpha-ketoglutaramate in cerebrospinal fluid appears to be a reliable diagnostic indicator of hepatic coma, and its accumulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W1580722234,"Abstract The urine from three patients with mannosidosis was found to contain abnormally high amounts of mannose-containing oligosaccharides. The highest yield (123 to 430 mg per liter of urine) was obtained of a trisaccharide, which was isolated and characterized. The isolation procedure included ultrafiltration, gel chromatography on Sephadex G-25, purification by preparative zone electrophoresis, and preparative paper chromatography. Sugar analysis showed that the trisaccharide consisted of 2 d-mannose moieties and 1 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose residue. The linkages and sequential order of the sugar units were established by methylation analysis of the reduced trisaccharide. The partially methylated sugars obtained on hydrolysis of the methylated trisaccharide alditol were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The anomeric configurations were determined by chromium trioxide oxidation followed by methylation analysis. Additional proof for the anomeric natures of the sugar units was obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis studies and by inhibition experiments using a precipitin system with concanavalin A. As a result of these studies, the structure of the trisaccharide could be established as α-d-mannopyranoside-(1→3)-β-d-mannopyranoside-(1→4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose. The oligosaccharide is most probably a degradation product derived from the inner core of glycoprotein chains."

Treating these animals with thyroxine lowers lactase activity to the control level at 24 days, but cortisone is only partly effective. Thyroidectomy at 6 days also results in persistence of high lactase activity; thyroxine again is more effective than cortisone in reducing activity. The thyroid gland appears to play a previously unsuspected role in intestinal maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1505677851,"Abstract The steady state kinetics of creatine kinase have been studied at pH 7 by initial velocity, product inhibition, and dead end inhibition techniques using chromium ATP and chromium ADP. The mechanism appears to be rapid equilibrium random in the MgADP plus phosphocreatine direction and equilibrium ordered with MgATP adding before creatine in the other direction. This degenerate form of the rapid equilibrium random mechanism found in both directions at pH 8 may be caused by protonation of a group on the enzyme at pH 7 that will not permit binding of the positively charged portion of creatine until the MgATP is already bound. The chromium nucleotides were competitive inhibitors versus the magnesium nucleotides and noncompetitive versus the guanido substrates. Except for MgATP, chromium and magnesium nucleotides have about the same affinity for the enzyme at pH 7. The 10-fold greater affinity of CrATP over MgATP for the enzyme may reflect an equilibrium between doubly (β,γ) and triply (α,β,γ) coordinated MgATP in solution with the triply coordinated nucleotide being the actual substrate. Nitrate synergizes creatine inhibition of reaction in the MgADP plus phosphocreatine direction, but was ineffective in synergizing CrADP inhibition in the MgATP plus creatine direction. This may be because the planar PO3 group which nitrate mimics in the E-MgADP-creatine-NO3 complex is coordinated to the Mg2+, but while nitrate can displace the water which is replacing PO3 from Mg2+, it cannot displace the water molecule covalently coordinated to chromium in the corresponding E-CrADP-creatine complex."

https://openalex.org/W1489162544,"Abstract Acrosin is a proteolytic enzyme used by sperm to digest a path through the zona pellucida of the ovum. In ejaculated sperm it is inactivated by a proteinase inhibitor from seminal plasma that also inhibits trypsin. This inhibitor is removed or inactivated during the residence in the female reproductive tract as a part of the capacitation process. The boar acrosin-inhibitor complex was partially purified using DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The complex was dissociated and the acrosin obtained in a highly purified form by the use of Sephadex gel filtration at pH 3.0. The final preparations were judged to be homogeneous on the basis of chromatographic and electrophoretic criteria and showed a molecular weight of 30,000. Acrosin has a temperature optimum of 53°, an esterase optimum at pH 8.5, and a proteolytic optimum on azocasein at pH 8.7. The enzyme is quite stable at pH 3.0 but undergoes destruction at slightly alkaline pH. Purified acrosin is both activated and stabilized by calcium ions; however, it is not stable to freezing nor to freeze-drying and is inactivated by urea."
https://openalex.org/W205481667,"Abstract The cationic site of the enzyme rhodanese forms ion pairs with the substrate and product anions, thiosulfate, cyanide, sulfite, and thiocyanate. It also forms ion pairs with such diverse anionic species as acetate, formate, sulfate, and glycinate. In rate studies, the equilibrium constants and their temperature dependencies were evaluated for the interactions of most of these anions with both the free enzyme and the sulfur-substituted enzyme intermediate. The ionic strength dependencies of the constants for the substrate, thiosulfate ion, and the inhibitor, sulfate ion, were also determined. The results of this study provide a basis for calculating the relative concentrations of all enzymic species under a broad variety of experimental conditions. Further, the study of the thermodynamic parameters indicates that the enzyme-anion interactions take place in an hydrophobic environment in which ion solvation is minimal. When the parameters of substrate and product origin are compared with those for the other enzyme-anion interactions, the results suggest that the protein undergoes conformational changes during the reaction. The direction of the entropy differences indicates that there are successive changes to a more constrained state on binding of the substrate, thiosulfate ion, and release of the product, sulfite ion, followed by a relaxation of the protein upon release of the product, thiocyanate ion."
https://openalex.org/W1567938798,"Abstract Circular dichroism, optical rotatory dispersion, and absorption studies allowed direct observation of the functioning enzyme protein and confirmed the major transformations of rhodanese indicated by study of the thermodynamic parameters. In these experiments, the catalytic sequence was treated as separate half reactions by omission of the second substrate. Based on the values of the kinetic constants reported in the preceding paper, substrate to product ratios were altered to interconvert the conformers of the enzyme-sulfur intermediate and the free enzyme. Detailed comparison of the spectra for the two forms yields a picture of the transformation involving some 20 amino acid residues in a change from a disordered coil-type structure to an ordered β-type structure as the enzyme binds thiosulfate ion and discharges sulfite ion. The inability of sulfate ion to produce a conformational change suggests that, in addition to the cationic site, another enzymic group is involved in substrate binding."

This compares favorably with the in vivo deamidation half-time of 8 days for this sequence in rabbit muscle aldolase.

https://openalex.org/W1586595480,"Abstract Dilute (g10% w/v) unsonicated phosphatidylserine dispersions in H2O contain spherical particles of a wide size distribution (0.1 to 15 µm). The majority have diameters between 0.1 to 2 µm and lack the multilamellar arrangement of bilayers typical of unsonicated lecithin dispersions. Sonication produces small thermodynamically unstable vesicles surrounded by a single closed bilayer with an average vesicle diameter of 160 A (range 125 to 250 A). The vesicles are more homogeneous with respect to size and their curvature is significantly greater than that of vesicles prepared from lecithins of similar chain length. While phosphatidylserine forms inverted micelles in organic solvent, no micelles were detected in sonicated, aqueous dispersions. Increasing the ionic strength leads to an increase in particle size and to the formation of multilamellar structures both with sonicated and unsonicated dispersions and eventually flocculation of a metal-phosphatidylserine complex occurs. Unsonicated phosphatidylserine dispersions give no high resolution spectrum. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on sonicated dispersions in 2H2O show that the molecular motion in the polar group of the molecule is sufficient for all protons, including those of the glycerol group, to contribute to the high resolution spectrum. Increasing the ionic strength leads to a closer packing of the polar groups and of the hydrocarbon chain CH2 groups close to the glycerol group without significantly affecting the correlation times of motion of most of the protons along the hydrocarbon chains. However, the anisotropy of the hydrocarbon chain motion and thus the degree of order within the bilayer increases significantly."
https://openalex.org/W1583286235,"Abstract Studies of the reversible interconversion of glycine and serine catalyzed by rabbit liver serine transhydroxymethylase in the presence and in the absence of tetrahydrofolate are described. The studies include measurements of pH-rate profiles, isotope effects, and spectral properties of the enzyme-substrate complexes. Vmax, values for the synthesis of serine from glycine and formaldehyde and the exchange of the 2S proton of glycine with protons of the solvent were found to be constant between pH 6.0 and 8.0. The Vmax for the degradation of serine to glycine and formaldehyde decreased as the pH was increased from 6.0 to 8.4. A dissociable group on the enzyme with a pK of about 7 appears to be involved. An isotope effect of 2 was found for [2S-2H]glycine in the synthesis of serine both in the presence and in the absence of tetrahydrofolate. The rate of serine synthesis in the presence of tetrahydrofolate is limited at high enzyme concentration by the rate of the nonenzymatic formation of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. That formaldehyde can react directly with the enzyme-glycine complex in the absence of tetrahydrofolate is suggested by the rapid quenching of the 495-nm and 343-nm absorption peaks of this complex by formaldehyde. Spectral evidence (the appearance of absorption maxima at 343 nm and 495 nm above pH 8 for solutions of enzyme and serine) suggests that serine is cleaved to an enzyme-glycine complex in the absence of tetrahydrofolate. The data are interpreted to support a mechanism in which formaldehyde is bound as an imine at the active site. The role of tetrahydrofolate appears to be catalyzing the formation or breakdown of this intermediate through the formation of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate."
https://openalex.org/W1556988813,"Abstract An endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase purified to homogeneity from the cultural filtrate of Streptomyces griseus was found to release an oligosaccharide, most probably the A unit, from bovine thyroglobulin. This oligosaccharide, containing 8 mannose residues and 1 N-acetylglucosamine, with the latter on the reducing end, was digested with jack bean meal α-mannosidase. An α-mannosidase-resistant disaccharide was isolated following the release of about 7 mannose residues. Based on the results obtained from gas chromatography, from Morgan-Elson color assay, and following treatment with hen oviduct β-mannosidase, the disaccharide appears to be O-β-d-Man(1→4)-d-GlcNAc. The structure of this disaccharide is consistent with that reported to be present in the core glycosyl asparagine unit of a number of glycoproteins. These findings are in contrast to those reported by Arima and Spiro ((1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 1836–1848) who indicated that all of the mannose residues in the unit A oligosaccharide of thyroglobulin were α-linked."

https://openalex.org/W1598923042,"Abstract The glycopeptides of porcine pancreatic lipases La and Lb have been isolated. Compositional and end group analyses, in addition to enzymatic hydrolysis with carboxypeptidases A and B, suggest the following amino acid sequence: Thr-Asx-Gly-Thr-Ile-Glu-Arg. Pronase digestion yielded a smaller glycopeptide which contained only aspartic acid, threonine, and glycine. The carbohydrate linkage is alkali-stable, indicating that N-acetylglucosamine is involved in an N-acylglucosylamine bond to asparagine. Lipases La and Lb contain fucose and galactose as well as mannose and glucosamine. Lipase La also contains sialic acid and gives rise to a more heterogeneous glycopeptide population upon proteolysis; the heterogeneity is due solely to the carbohydrate moieties."
https://openalex.org/W1518643175,"Abstract Computer simulation of the full time course of an enzymatic reaction may be used to help define certain characteristics of the mechanism of reaction. In particular, such studies may be the best way to approach the kinetic properties of those enzymes which show hysteretic behavior. Furthermore, full time course studies may be used to differentiate between various mechanisms involving two substrates. For example, it is shown that different time courses may be obtained for a mechanism assuming ordered addition of substrates relative to one assuming a random addition of substrates. It is pointed out that the use of full time course studies may be applicable to a large number of mechanisms as a routine kinetic method of great utility for approaching the definition of such mechanisms. After a mechanism for an enzymatic reaction has been assumed, the full time course computer simulation program discussed here can also be used as a data-fitting program to obtain kinetic parameters for both the forward and reverse reactions."

https://openalex.org/W1523139643,"Abstract Bovine pyruvate kinases from skeletal muscle and from liver have been hybridized in vitro, producing an equally spaced, five-membered set of electrophoretically distinct species. This set consists of the tetrameric parental forms, designated L4 and M4 for the liver and muscle isozymes, respectively, plus three hybrids designated L3M, L2M2, and LM3 according to their content of type L and type M subunits. The hybrids were separated and isolated by isoelectric focusing. Neither the native enzymes nor the isolated hybrids showed any tendency to exist in more than one electrophoretic form. However, denaturation and renaturation of each isolated hybrid produced a reassortment of its subunits with the subsequent appearance of other members of the electrophoretic set. The subunit designations assigned to the hybrids, and the fact that they are tetramers, is inferred from their equal spacing between the parental enzymes after electrophoresis. In addition, the tetrameric nature of L2M2 was demonstrated directly by showing that it sediments in a sucrose density gradient at a velocity midway between native L4 and M4. Skeletal muscle pyruvate kinase is known to exhibit hyperbolic kinetics (Hill coefficient, nh = 1) and to be unaffected by fructose diphosphate. On the other hand, liver pyruvate kinase exhibits sigmoidal kinetics with varying phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations (nh = 2.4) and is activated by fructose diphosphate. Because the kinetic properties of these two native forms are so very different, we examined the catalytic behavior of the isolated hybrids with the hope of establishing the contribution to total hybrid activity made by the type L and type M subunits. The LM3 hybrid has hyperbolic kinetics with P-enolpyruvate and is unaffected by fructose diphosphate. L2M2, on the other hand, has hyperbolic kinetics with P-enolpyruvate, but has increased activity in the presence of fructose diphosphate. In contrast to these two species, L3M has sigmoidal kinetics with P-enolpyruvate (nh = 1.5) and hyperbolic kinetics only when fructose diphosphate is added. The kinetic properties of the hybrids were compared to mixtures of L4 and M4 having an equivalent ratio of type L to type M subunits. These comparisons showed that the hybrids do not have the same kinetic characteristics as equivalent mixtures of L4 and M4, indicating that the catalytic properties of a subunit are affected by the presence of nonhomologous subunits in the same molecule. It appears that the presence of three type M subunits in the LM3 hybrid, and two in the L2M2 hybrid, induce the L subunits in those species to exhibit hyperbolic kinetics. Conversely, the presence of three type L subunits in the L3M hybrid induces the M subunit in that species to exhibit sigmoidal kinetics. The data obtained in this study suggest that the properties of pyruvate kinase hybrids result from changes in an equilibrium between active and less active forms in agreement with the concerted model of Monod et al. ((1965) J. Mol. Biol. 12, 88–118), although other models may, of course, be equally applicable. It appears that a high proportion of type M subunits favors the active state and produces hyperbolic kinetics, while a high proportion of type L subunits in a hybrid favors the less active state and produces sigmoidal kinetics."

https://openalex.org/W1627907172,"Abstract The effect of concentration of 13C- and 14C-labeled acetate in the soluble pool on the distribution of 13C or 14C in the maleimide ring of showdomycin by Streptomyces showdoensis has been studied. 13C incorporation was observed by means of proton-decoupled 13C Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy. 13C NMR spectra confirmed earlier findings that the carboxyl carbon of [1-14C]acetate incorporates exclusively in carbon 5 of the maleimide ring. When the concentration of acetate is 0.2 µm, all four carbons of the maleimide ring are labeled by 14C from [2-14C]acetate. At high concentration of [2-13C]acetate (1800 µm), carbons 2, 3, and 4 are labeled, but carbon 5 is not. These observations can be explained by the combined action of the Krebs cycle and the malic enzyme. The malic enzyme would give rise to [1,2-14C]acetate from [2-14C]acetate. At 1800 µm, the [1,2-13C]acetate formed via the malic enzyme is diluted by the large amounts of [2-13C]acetate in the acid-soluble pool. The result is a negligible 13C incorporation into carbon 5. The 13C NMR findings were confirmed by using high and low concentrations of [2-14C]acetate. The percentage of 14C in carbon 5 decreased from 22% (low acetate) to 4% (high acetate). While it is very difficult to make comparisons of enzyme activities concerned with the biosynthesis of a compound such as showdomycin, it is now possible to study the actual physiological effects of high and low concentrations of acetate in intact cells. This type of study provides an accurate picture of the biochemistry of those compounds as determined by the Krebs cycle and the malic enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2121889892,"Abstract 1. Energy-linked K+ uptake has been demonstrated in submitochondrial particles prepared by sonication of beef heart mitochondria in the presence of ammonia (A-particles) as well as in more highly resolved submitochondrial particles obtained by Sephadex and urea treatment of A-particles (ASU-particles). 2. Nigericin stimulated K+ accumulation by A-particles but was required for significant K+ uptake by ASU-particles. Since nigericin catalyzes a K+ for H+ exchange, the spontaneous uptake of K+ by A-particles may be mediated by a nigericin-like natural carrier similarly catalyzing K+ for H+ exchange. 3. A-particles and ASU-particles appeared to be highly permeable to NO3- and less so to Cl-. 4. The combinations of valinomycin plus NH4+ or valinomycin, nigericin, and K+, uncoupled A-particles reconstituted with purified coupling factors, and released respiratory control. In contrast to submitochondrial particles with respiratory control induced by oligomycin or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, the particles supplemented with coupling factors catalyzed oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1578902962,"Abstract The l-glutamine analogs, l-albizziin (l-α-amino-β-ureido-propionic acid), S-carbamyl-l-cysteine, and O-carbamyl-l-serine were found to be substrates for purified rat liver glutamine transaminase, and the α-keto acid product formed in each case was found to cyclize to a lactam analogous in structure to the cyclic form of α-ketoglutaramic acid (2-pyrrolidone-5-hydroxy-5-carboxylic acid). Evidence was obtained that the initial product of transamination of albizziin, S-carbamylcysteine, and O-carbamylserine are the corresponding α-keto acids, which were found to be converted by ω-amidase (followed by spontaneous decarboxylation) to β-aminopyruvate, β-mercaptopyruvate, and β-hydroxypyruvate, respectively. Incubation of the glutamine analogs with l-amino acid oxidase from Crotalus adamanteus venom gave the corresponding cyclic lactam forms; the products obtained from albizziin and S-carbamyl-cysteine were rapidly and irreversibly dehydrated in acid or base to yield 2-imidazolinone-4-carboxylic acid and 2-thiazolinone-4-carboxylic acid, respectively. Neither α-ketoglutaramate nor 2-oxazolidone-4-hydroxy-4-carboxylic acid (which was isolated as the corresponding barium salt) was dehydrated under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1542069803,"Two catalytically inert conformers of rhodanese have been observed. One arises from a slow autoconversion of the free enzyme and can be induced to a catalytically active form by the substrate, thiosulfate ion. The other results upon reaction of the free enzyme with the inhibitors, iodoacetate and sulfite ions. The inert conformers can be related to dimeric forms of the enzyme protein. Release of the bound sulfur atom from the sulfur-substituted enzyme intermediate has been detected in the absence of the cyanide ion acceptor substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2018688544,"Dihydroxycoprostane and trihydroxycoprostane, intermediates in normal bile acid synthesis in the liver, enhanced the rate of porphyrin synthesis in cultured liver cells by induction of delta-aminolevulinate synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme for this pathway. Other 5beta-cholestane derivatives and cholest-5-ene derivatives were ineffective. The selectivity of the induction may indicate that the above-mentioned coprostanes have a physiological role in porphyrin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1490064785,"Abstract Inactivation of ammonium sulfate-precipitated lipase requires, in addition to ATP and Mg2+ion, a dialyzable factor present in homogenates of adipose tissue (Tsai, S.-C., and Vaughan, M. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 6253–6258) and liver which has now been identified as ascorbic acid. It was extracted from acetone powder of rat liver with methanol-water, 70:30, and purified using barium precipitation and ion exchange and paper chromatography. Approximately 3 mg of a fine white powder obtained from 100 g of liver were used for preparation of trimethylsilyl and deuterotrimethylsilyl derivatives with and without prior reaction with diazomethane. Analysis of these with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry led to the conclusion that the factor was ascorbic acid. This was confirmed by analysis of the trimethylsilyl derivative of authentic l-ascorbic acid. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum and chemical characteristics of the isolated material were consistent with this designation. Lipase inactivation was proportional to ascorbic acid concentration in the range of 0.3 to 3 µm in the presence of 2 mm ATP and 4 mm MgCl2. In the absence of the latter, ascorbic acid, like the inactivation factor, did not alter lipase activity. Identification of ascorbic acid as the tissue factor required for Mg2+ATP-dependent inactivation of the hormone-sensitive lipase should facilitate further characterization of this process. In addition, because the requirement for ascorbic acid appears to be rather specific and the effective concentrations low relative to those employed in many other enzymatic systems, these observations may lead to the demonstration of a role for ascorbic acid in reactions of a type not hitherto associated with this compound."
https://openalex.org/W1577815393,"Abstract CNBr cleavage of rabbit heavy chain leads to the formation of a fragment, C1, which consists of the NH2-terminal half of the heavy chain. Fragment C1 is cleaved at methionyl residues but held together by intrachain S—S bonds to that total reduction and alkylation liberates new fragments. In the case of the C1 fragment from an anti-p-azobenzoate antibody of restricted heterogeneity, total reduction, and alkylation liberated six fragments which were isolated in good yield. Small amounts of other fragments were apparent. The six fragments were identified on the basis of molecular weights, amino acid compositions, and NH2-terminal sequences and represent residues 1 to 253, 1 to 34, 1 to 55, 56 to 140, 141 to 253, and 85 to 253. There was no evidence of acid splits, incomplete CNBr cleavage, or incomplete reduction. From the known positions of half-cystine residues and the fact that some of these fragments represent overlapping regions, it appears that heavy chains having different distributions of methionine are present. Therefore this heavy chain is not homogeneous. In contrast, the light chain from this antibody preparation appears to be homogeneous. This indicates that a limited set of different heavy chains may be paired with a single light chain to generate related antibody molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1597582257,"Abstract The appearance of sequential forms of inhibitor in a mixture of inhibitor and less than equimolar quantities of porcine trypsin at pH 2.75 has been monitored by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each of the detected forms has been isolated and identified by its Rf in gel electrophoresis, its composition, and its NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal amino acids. The sequence of the bond cleavages by trypsin during temporary inhibition is Lys 14-Ile 15, followed by Arg 40-Gln 41, Lys 48-Ser 49, and Lys 38-Lys 39. The modified inhibitor (with one cleavage at the reactive site) was active while all other forms were inactive. The second cleavage, Arg 40-Gln 41, is the temporary (inactivating) cleavage. The modifying cleavage of the Lys 14-Ile 15 bond was found to be an obligatory step for the further digestion of the inhibitor. The reversible nature of the reactive site bond cleavage was demonstrated in gel electrophoresis by the examination of separate incubations of virgin and modified inhibitors with trypsin. Starting with either form, a mixture of virgin and modified inhibitor was obtained. The modified inhibitor was susceptible to digestion by α-chymotrypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1553961202,"Abstract The molecular weight of the heavy chain (µ) of the immunoglobulin M isolated from mouse myeloma tumor MOPC 104E is 73,000 as determined by gel filtration. Of the heavy chain, 13.3% or 9,700 g/73,000 g of protein is carbohydrate, yielding a carbohydrate-free molecular weight of 63,000. By amino acid analysis the heavy chain consists of 549 residues, with molecular weight 61,000. The NH2-terminal residue was glutamic acid, and the COOH-terminal residue was tyrosine. Comparison of tryptic peptide maps of this heavy chain with two other mouse µ chains, from McPC 471 and RN 140, showed a large number of common peptides but the same degree of variability in the remaining peptides as seen in γ and α heavy chains."

https://openalex.org/W1597789954,"Abstract The solubility of glycine, diglycine, and triglycine was investigated in water-ethanol mixtures (20% and 50% ethanol) as a function of the temperature. The transfer free energy, ΔFtrconh, for the peptide group was evaluated and the separate enthalpy and entropy components of the transfer process were determined. In 20% ethanol solutions, the hypothesis of additivity of the contribution of various molecular groups to the transfer parameters was verified. Values obtained as the difference triglycine-diglycine in 20% ethanol at 25° were ΔFtrconh = +120 cal per mole, ΔStrconh = -1.7 e.u., ΔHtrconh = -390 cal per mole. These values appear to be in excellent agreement with previous results obtained for the coil → helix transformation of poly-l-ornithine in 20% ethanol solutions. It has been confirmed that helical stabilization in mixed solvents is an entropic effect, arising from the negative value of the transfer entropy, ΔStrconh (from water to water-organic solvent mixtures)."
