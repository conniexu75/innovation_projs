https://openalex.org/W1977990767,"A radioreceptor assay with a sensitivity of 5 nanograms per milliliter has been developed for mammalian and avian pituitary prolactin, placental lactogenic hormones, and humnan growth hormone, using a membrane receptor preparation isolated from rabbit mammary glands. Prolactin preparations inhibited the binding of [(125)I]prolactin to receptors in direct proportion to the biological potency of these preparations. Thus, the radioreceptor assay provides a convenient and simnple assay for hormones which have lactogenic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1576106895,"Escherichia coli B contains two electrophoretically distinct superoxide dismutases, one of which was previously isolated and found to be a mangano-protein. We have now isolated the other superoxide dismutase present in this organism. It contains 1 atom of Fe3+ per molecule and exhibits spectral properties reminiscent of aconitase. Its molecular weight is 38,700 and it is composed of two subunits of equal size which are not covalently joined. The amino acid composition of this ferrisuperoxide dismutase is similar to that of the mangano-enzyme previously isolated from the same source."
https://openalex.org/W1546653317,"Two general categories of ATPases are present in tissue. One group requires Na+ and K+ as well as Mg2+ for maximum enzyme activity and functions in active transport of Na + , K + , and other substances across cell membranes. The second group of ATPases requires Mg2+ or Ca2+ for activation. The biochemical and physiological significances of the Mg2+-Ca2 +-activated enzyme systems are less understood. The one major protein system activated by Mg2+ or Ca2+ which has received extensive study is the actomyosin complex; in this system the hydrolysis of ATP stimulated by divalent cations plays an essential role in muscle contraction and relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W2076789308,"A specific inhibitor of angiotensin II was used in rats to investigate whether angiotensin is involved in the maintenance of blood pressure in one-kidney Goldblatt hypertension, in which plasma renin levels are not usually increased. The inhibitor produced marked falls in blood pressure, often down to normal levels in the hypertensive animals only when they were depleted in sodium and not after sodium repletion. Much lesser but still significant falls in blood pressure were also produced in normotensive sodium-depleted rats but not in repleted rats. We conclude that the importance of angiotensin for maintaining blood pressure is largely determined by its relation to available sodium or fluid volume, since the renin component in maintenance of either the hypertensive or the normotensive state could be exposed only by sodium deprivation. Therefore, volume expansion per se or other pressor factors may be involved in maintaining blood pressure of these sodium-replete normotensive or hypertensive animals."
https://openalex.org/W1543621878,"Abstract The structure of ferricytochrome c2 from the non-sulfur purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum has been determined at 2 A resolution by x-ray crystallographic methods. The 112-residue polypeptide chain encloses a single covalently bound heme in a predominantly hydrophobic environment, leaving only one edge exposed to the solvent at the front of the molecule. Distributed around the exterior perimeter of the heme crevice are 11 lysine residues which form an essentially uninterrupted positively charged patch. The molecule contains four segments of α-helix, with the conformation of the remainder of the chain being primarily governed by interactions with the heme. A hypothetical scheme for folding of the molecule is presented, based primarily upon the assumption that the helical regions are formed first and are subsequently distorted by hydrophobic interactions with the heme. The heme iron is coordinated to nitrogen Ne2 of His 18 and to the sulfur atom of Met 91 in the fifth and sixth positions. A notable feature of the structure is an apparently off axis or bent Met 91 sulfur-iron bond. The non-axial nature of this bond is attributed to a charge-pair interaction between the Tyr 70 hydroxyl oxygen, bearing a partial negative charge, and the Met 91 sulfur atom, bearing a partial positive charge delocalized from the ferriheme iron. This interaction serves to stabilize the oxidized heme. The additional participation of Tyr 70 in a hydrogen bond network via Tyr 52 to Ser 89 on the front surface of the molecule suggests that the physiological mechanism for reduction of cytochrome c2 involves concerted protonation of Ser 89 concomitant with electron donation to the heme. The process is reversed for oxidation. This proposed mechanism has several chemical and structural implications, the most important being that the site of interaction with physiological oxido-reductants is at the front of the cytochrome c2 molecule. These conclusions appear to be substantiated by a variety of published findings, including pH dependence of the midpoint potential of cytochrome c2 and polylysine inhibition of cytochrome c2 reactivity in physiological oxidation-reduction systems."
https://openalex.org/W1567589799,"Abstract We have examined the effects of phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus (Bc) and from Clostridium perfringens (Cp) on various parameters involved in the activity and response of adenylate cyclase to glucagon in rat liver plasma membranes. A crude preparation of Cp-phospholipase C hydrolyzes neutral phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin) in these membranes. In contrast, highly purified Bc-phospholipase C hydrolyzes acidic phospholipids (phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol) but not sphingomyelin. Treatment of the membranes with either type of phospholipase does not alter basal adenylate cyclase activity or the stimulatory effects of fluoride ion on the enzyme system. Bc-phospholipase C abolishes the effects of glucagon on adenylate cyclase whereas Cp-phospholipase C causes only partial loss of glucagon response even after hydrolysis of 60% of the membrane phospholipids. These findings provide evidence that acidic phospholipids are more specifically involved in glucagon activation of adenylate cyclase. Acidic phospholipids are not directly involved in the binding of glucagon to its receptor. Treatment with Bc-phospholipase C results in a 10-fold reduction in the affinity but not the quantity of specific binding sites for glucagon. Binding of Des-His-glucagon, a competitive, inactive analogue of glucagon is unaffected by Bc-phospholipase C treatment and displays the same apparent affinity as does glucagon for the binding sites in phospholipase-treated membranes. These findings suggest that acidic phospholipids are involved in the liganding of the histidine residue of glucagon to a regulatory site responsible for glucagon action. GTP, which is required for glucagon action on adenylate cyclase and which increases the rate of dissociation of glucagon from its receptor, does not exert these effects in Bc-phospholipase C-treated membranes. GTP also does not alter the rate of dissociation of Des-His-glucagon from the binding sites in either untreated or treated membranes, indicating that the histidine residue of glucagon is required for the effects of GTP to be expressed. It appears, therefore, that GTP and the histidine residue of glucagon bind to a common site involved both in the activation of adenylate cyclase and in the dissociation of glucagon from its receptor. Acidic phospholipids are required for the concerted effects of glucagon and GTP at this site."
https://openalex.org/W1530956256,"Abstract The technique used previously to observe complex formation between bacitracin, Mg++, and C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate has been employed to measure association constants. The constant for the bacitracin A, Mg++, C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate complex was 106 m-1. The binding constants for other bacitracin peptides were lower and correlated with their antibiotic activities. C15-farnesyl pyrophosphate also formed a complex with K ∼ 106 m-1 but K for C5-isopentenyl pyrophosphate and for inorganic pyrophosphate was much smaller. The metal ion also influenced the strength of the association constant (Zn++ g Cd++ g Mg++). The pH dependency of complex formation indicated that a defined ionization state was required for maximum stability. These data indicate that both hydrophobic and polar interactions are involved in complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1509314250,"Abstract Investigation of the factors influencing [3H]concanavalin A binding to normal and transformed cells has led us to develop a binding assay in which cells are incubated with [3H]concanavalin A for 5 min at 0° at pH 7.2 and 1.0 mm Mg2+. Under such conditions we have found that transformed cells bind 3.5 to 5 times more [3H]concanavalin A than does the normal interphase cell. We have also used this assay to demonstrate that normal cells treated with proteases and normal cells in mitosis bind more [3H]concanavalin A than does the normal interphase cell. These data demonstrate that there are more concanavalin A receptor sites exposed on the transformed cell than on the normal cell. However this increase in agglutinin receptor sites cannot, by itself, explain the increase in agglutinability demonstrated by transformed cells as compared to normal cells."

Nonimmunologic recognition and destruction of target cells by activated macrophages is independent of altered morphology, abnormal karyotype, and ability for continuous multiplication in vitro-all characteristics of 3T3 fibroblasts. A modification e f the target cell surface that results in a high in vitro saturation density, agglutinability by plant lectins, and tumorigenicity appears to evoke a cytotoxic response by activated macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1600388849,"Abstract The use of urea in gel and ion exchange chromatography is shown to facilitate greatly the fractionation of the C-apolipoproteins from human plasma very low density lipoproteins. However, it is demonstrated that the use of urea at room temperature can lead to the production of artifactual polymorphism through carbamylation of the C-apolipoproteins. The bead column technique of Sachs and Painter has been adapted for use with superfine Sephadex gels and urea solutions for the rapid and reproducible fractionation of the very low density apolipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1516572497,"Insulin produces an increase in the conversion of the D form (glucose-6-P dependent) of liver glycogen synthase to the I form (glucose-6-P independent) when injected intravenously into fed alloxan diabetic rats. Insulin activates glycogen synthase previously inactivated by glucagon in isolated perfused livers from normal rats, while increasing [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen and decreasing glucagon-stimulated glucose production. This change in synthase activity is associated with a decrease in synthase (protein) kinase activity and tissue adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate levels when insulin is used to antagonize the effects of glucagon. Finally, insulin alone has a direct effect on the activation of glycogen synthase (D to I shift) in perfused livers from normal rats if insulin infusion is begun after an initial 30-min perfusion period. This effect is maximal between 6 and 15 min and is no longer present after 30 min. Associated changes include an increase in [14C]-glucose incorporation into glycogen at 10 min and a decrease in synthase kinase activity at 6 and 15 min. This decrease in kinase activity is not associated with a decrease in apparent hepatic concentrations of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2034381219,"Lesions of the entorhinal cortex in neonatal rats cause the commissural projections to the dentate gyrus to spread from their normal location in the inner molecular layer into the outer molecular layer, a region normally occupied by afferents from the entorhinal cortex. These lesions also cause the short-latency response to commissural stimulation to spread into the outer molecular layer, a result suggesting that these abnormally located connections are operative."
https://openalex.org/W1903878942,"Abstract Wheat germ agglutinin enhances the specific binding of insulin to isolated fat cells and to liver cell membranes at a concentration of about 1 µg per ml. Wheat germ agglutinin increases insulin binding by increasing the rate of insulin-receptor complex formation; the protein does not alter the rate of dissociation of the insulin-membrane complex or the total number of binding sites for insulin. Higher concentrations of wheat germ agglutinin, as well as concanavalin A, block the binding of insulin to fat cells when the plant lectins are added to the cells before insulin. If the insulin-receptor complex is formed before addition of the plant lectin, only an increase in insulin binding with wheat germ agglutinin and virtually no effect of concanavalin A are demonstrable. Studies using combinations of both plant lectins suggest that these proteins are binding to different regions of the insulin receptor and that some lectin molecules can bind to the cell in a way which is without effect on insulin binding unless the other lectin is also present. Wheat germ agglutinin and concanavalin A modify insulin binding in membrane preparations in a manner similar to that described for intact fat cells. Similar alterations of insulin binding occur with soluble preparations of the insulin receptor of liver and fat cell membranes. These results indicate that the changes in the binding of insulin occur by direct binding of the plant lectins to the insulin receptor macromolecule. All of the effects of the plant lectins are reversed rapidly by adding simple sugars having selective specificity for the proteins, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (for wheat germ agglutinin) or α-methyl-d-mannopyranoside (for concanavalin A). Digestion of fat cells with trypsin, which results in a marked fall in the affinity of the membrane receptor for insulin, similarly reduces the apparent affinity of wheat germ agglutinin for the membrane sites with which the lectin interacts to enhance glucose oxidation in the fat cells. These studies suggest that the insulin-like biological activity of wheat germ agglutinin may result from direct interactions with the insulin receptor in a way which closely resembles the interaction with insulin. If concanavalin A stimulates glucose transport by interacting with the insulin receptor, such an interaction must be somewhat dissimilar from that of insulin since tryptic digestion of cells does not markedly affect the biological response to this protein. These studies indicate that the insulin-binding macromolecules of liver and fat cell membranes are proteins of complex carbohydrate composition which have several chemically distinct sites capable of binding plant lectins in a manner which perturbs the insulin-receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1642939127,"Abstract Yeast cytochrome oxidase has been highly purified by a procedure involving solubilization in deoxycholic acid, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Standard preparations of beef cytochrome oxidase have been further purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation. The heme contents of the yeast and beef enzymes, respectively, were 15 and 12 nmoles of heme a per mg of protein. Yeast oxidase is composed of at least seven polypeptides when examined on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The molecular weights of the component polypeptides on 7.5% acrylamide gels range from 35,000 to 8,600. The beef enzyme has six subunits of molecular weights 34,500 to 7,300. The molecular weight of yeast cytochrome oxidase, determined by a combination of sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration, was 226,000 after correction for bound detergent."
https://openalex.org/W1507431732,"The biosynthetic origin of cytochrome oxidase has been studied in yeast using specific inhibitors of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic protein synthesis. Rabbit antiserum against cytochrome oxidase has been employed to selectively precipitate the enzyme from crude Triton extracts of submitochondrial particles. Yeast aerated in derepression medium containing cycloheximide synthesize the three largest subunit proteins of cytochrome oxidase. These proteins are not synthesized when cells are aerated in the presence of chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis. It is concluded that the three largest subunit polypeptides of cytochrome oxidase are translated on mitochondrial ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1535112631,"Abstract The effects of epinephrine and insulin on three enzyme systems in adipocytes were investigated with regard to the role of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in their control and the possibility that differential regulatory mechanisms might operate beyond cyclic AMP. When rat adipocytes were incubated with increasing concentrations of epinephrine (0.01 to 100 µm) elevation of cyclic AMP and glycerol production, activation of phosphorylase and deactivation of glycogen synthase appeared to be closely correlated. Activatability of hormone-sensitive in cell extracts by cyclic AMP-dependent protein decreased with increasing concentrations of epinephrine indicating conversion of the nonactivated to the activated form during incubation of the cells. Activation of in cell-free extracts by cyclic AMP and MgATP was promptly arrested by addition of protein inhibitor. This finding, together with results of previous studies, rules against the involvement of a lipase kinase analogous to that of phosphorylase in phosphorylase activation. Phosphorylase activities measured between pH 6.0 and 9.2 were unaffected at any concentration of epinephrine. Moreover, activation of phosphorylase in cell-free extracts was not inhibited by addition of protein inhibitor. When adipocytes were incubated in Ca2+-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium, activation of phosphorylase in response to epinephrine was not impaired. Phosphorylase assayed in cell-free extracts did not require Ca2+ for the activation of endogenous phosphorylase. However, some Ca2+ dependence was shown when exogenous skeletal muscle phosphorylase b was used as substrate. Thus, Ca2+ does not appear to regulate the catalytic activity of adipocyte phosphorylase kinase, nor could any change in the activation state of this enzyme in response to epinephrine be observed. These results distinguish adipocyte phosphorylase from that in muscle and in heart which requires Ca2+ and is clearly convertible to an activated form by epinephrine. Incubation of adipocytes with glucose (10 mm) significantly reduced the phosphorylase activity ratio (activity in the absence of 5'-AMP divided by that in its presence). Epinephrine stimulated increases in lipolysis and phosphorylase activity in the presence or absence of glucose, but its effect on glycogen synthase was apparent only in the presence of glucose. The insulin-induced increase in glycogen synthase activity ratio (activity in the absence of glucose 6-phosphate divided by that in its presence) was also dependent on glucose. Insulin (0.4 nm, 50 microunits per ml), in the presence of glucose, almost completely antagonized the epinephrine-induced increases in lipolysis, activation of phosphorylase and deactivation of glycogen synthase. The antilipolytic action of insulin in cells previously exposed to epinephrine was associated with reversion of the activated to its nonactivated form. However, insulin antagonized the elevation of cyclic AMP induced by epinephrine only marginally. This dissociation between the antagonism of insulin and epinephrine on the activities of the three enzymes on the one hand and the concentration of cyclic AMP on the other hand makes it seem unlikely that the action of insulin is mediated by a reduction in cyclic AMP concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1556768635,"Abstract Sialidase activity, ganglioside patterns, and total cellular sialic acid content were determined for normal and transformed hamster cells in tissue culture. Sialidase activity toward added extracellular disialo- and trisialoganglioside substrate was found in all transformed cell lines studied. Activity ranged from 0.6 µg of sialic acid released per mg of protein per 90 min, for a spontaneously transformed line of baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21), to 1.8 µg of sialic acid per mg of protein per 90 min, for a cell line (Ad 12) derived from an adenovirus 12-induced tumor. No measurable sialidase activity toward added ganglioside substrate was found in control, untransformed, hamster embryo fibroblasts (HEF), baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK), or adult hamster kidney fibroblasts (AHK). These findings indicate that tumorigenic transformation is accompanied by the appearance of sialidase activity directable toward extracellular lipid-bound sialyl substrate. No consistent change in the ganglioside pattern of the whole cell was observed upon transformation. Hematoside (Gm3) was the major ganglioside in all of the control and transformed cell lines with the exception of Ad 12, where monosialoganglioside (Gm1) appeared to be present in greater amount. Total cellular sialic acid values obtained after cell transformation were either the same as those for the normal, e.g. 3.8 µg of sialic acid per mg of protein for the HEF, normal, and Ad 12, transformed, cell lines, or less than those for the HEF cells, e.g. 3.5 and 2.9 µg of sialic acid per mg of protein for the Ad 7 (derived from an adenovirus 7-induced tumor) and the BHK-21 cell lines, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1494659988,"Abstract Two metal derivatives of superoxide dismutase have been prepared and partially characterized by optical, circular dichroic (CD), and EPR spectroscopies. Only 2 Co(II) ions will bind to apo superoxide dismutase and evidence is presented that these occupy the zinc-binding sites of the protein molecule. This derivative, referred to as 2Co protein, has an absorption maximum at 583 nm with each ion having a molar absorbance of ∼370. The CD spectrum possesses at least two weak negative bands near 585 nm and 530 nm. The EPR spectrum below 100°K shows g⊥ = 4 and g|| = 2.16 resonances. Addition of 2 meq of Cu(II) ions to the 2Co protein over a period of 1 to 24 hours results in the formation of a complex in which Cu(II) appears to be bound in its native position. This derivative, referred to as 2Co2Cu protein, has an absorption maximum near 680 nm with each Cu(II) having an absorbance index of ∼150 liters per mole cm. The Co(II) in this derivative has absorption maxima at 568 nm and 598 nm, the latter having an absorbance index per mole of Co(II) of 370. Evidence is presented that the optical and CD spectra of the 2Co2Cu protein are not the sum of the appropriate spectra of 2Co and native proteins; thus, the spectral properties of each ion depend on the presence of the other. Only 20 to 30% of the Cu(II) in the 2Co2Cu protein can be detected by EPR spectroscopy. Similarly, only a portion of the Co(II) is observed by EPR at helium temperatures. However, on reduction of the Cu(II) an EPR signal appears which has an intensity and parameters similar to that of the 2Co protein. Thus, the Co(II) and Cu(II) ions must be quite close to one another in this derivative. By analogy, this supports our previous contention that the zinc and copper ions are bound as two copper-zinc pairs in the native protein (Fee, J. A., and Gaber, B. P. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 60)."
https://openalex.org/W1512828743,"Abstract The specific interaction of glucocorticoids with lung and liver nuclei of rabbit fetuses was studied in vivo and in vitro. Twenty minutes after the administration of [3H]cortisol to rabbit fetuses in utero, the concentration of radioactivity in lung nuclei is about 5 times higher than in liver nuclei. The simultaneous administration of a 250-fold excess of non-labeled cortisol almost completely inhibits the nuclear uptake of the labeled hormone. A major fraction of the radioactivity (identified as cortisol) extracted from lung and liver nuclei is bound to macromolecules excluded from Sephadex G-25. After incubation of fetal lung and liver with [3H]cortisol or [3H]dexamethasone at 37°, it was demonstrated that both tissues contain a limited number of specific nuclear binding sites which are saturated with low hormone concentrations (1 x 10-8 m dexamethasone and 5 x 10-8 m cortisol). The concentrations of specific binding sites are estimated to be ∼6000 per nucleus in the lung and ∼1500 per nucleus in the liver, assuming a homogeneous cell population. The ability of various steroids to block the nuclear uptake of [3H]cortisol and [3H]dexamethasone in fetal lung correlates well with their glucocorticoid potency with the exception of cortisone and 21-deoxycortisol. The effect of cortisone is due to the ability of the fetal lung, under the conditions used, to convert efficiently cortisone to cortisol. The nuclear glucocorticoid-binding macromolecule of fetal lung appears to be a protein since the complex is destroyed by Pronase and p-chloromercuribenzoate but not only by nucleases. Competition studies indicate that in the fetal lung both [3H]cortisol and [3H]dexamethasone interact with the same nuclear sites, but the steroid-protein complexes differ in stability. The [3H]cortisol-protein complex is very unstable and dissociates rapidly at 0°. In contrast, the [3H]dexamethasone-protein complex is relatively stable, and it was characterized by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The complex has a sedimentation coefficient of 4 to 5 S in the presence or absence of 0.4 m KCl. Upon gel filtration through Sephadex G-200 bound [3H]dexamethasone in lung nuclear extracts is resolved into two fractions. The first fraction represents heavy complexes (probably aggregate) which are excluded from the gel. The second and major fraction of bound [3H]-dexamethasone is associated with proteins which are retained by the gel and have a molecular weight of about 150,000."
https://openalex.org/W1484303750,"Abstract Glucagon stimulates glucose synthesis from xylitol and dihydroxyacetone in the isolated perfused rat liver. In addition to increasing the initial rate of glucose production from these substrates, the hormone also increases the efficiency of gluconeogenesis causing at least 90% of the substrate consumed by the liver to be converted to glucose. These effects of glucagon on gluconeogenesis are observed even when quinolinate is added to block entry of compounds through phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. The formation of lactate from xylitol and oxidation of xylitol to CO2 are inhibited approximately 80% and 70%, respectively, by glucagon. Measurement of the steady-state concentrations of the gluconeogenic intermediates accompanying the stimulation of gluconeogenesis from xylitol and dihydroxyacetone show that the hormone markedly decreases the concentration of fructose 1,6-diphosphate. The mechanism by which glucagon causes the drastic fall in fructose-1,6-P2 cannot be explained in terms of the known allosteric regulation of fructose 1,6-diphosphatase and phosphofructokinase. The observations reported in this communication suggest that the effect of glucagon on gluconeogenesis and glycolysis is the result of a complex interaction rather than regulation of one particular enzyme of the gluconeogenic-glycolytic pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2122372989,"The hydrolysis of specifically labeled phosphatidylethanolamine and the 1 and 2 isomers of lysophosphatidylethanolamine catalyzed by enzymes in three subcellular fractions of Escherichia coli (wall, inner membrane and cytosol) has been studied. Two hydrolytic activities, phospholipases A1 and A2, are localized in the wall. Both enzymatic activities manifest similar properties and requirements for optimal activity, but it remains to be established whether both reside in the same enzyme. A hydrolytic activity toward the 1-acyl isomer of lysophosphatidylethanolamine is also present in the wall but it is unlikely that this activity can be ascribed to another catabolic enzyme. Rather, it appears that the phospholipase A1 also acts on the 1-acyl isomer of lysophosphatidylethanolamine. A lysophospholipase A2 that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 2-acyl isomer of lysophosphatidylethanolamine to fatty acid and glycerophosphorylethanolamine was detected in the inner membrane of E. coli. A lysophospholipase A1 was also detected in the membrane, as well as in the cytosol fraction. The presence in the supernatant fraction of a phospholipase that was active on phosphatidylglycerol, but inactive on phosphatidylethanolamine, was confirmed. Also present in the supernate is a phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycerophosphorylethanolamine to sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and ethanolamine. Thus the cell-free extract of E. coli contains all of the enzymes necessary for the complete degradation of phosphatidylethanolamine to fatty acids, sn-glycerol 3-phosphate, and ethanolamine."
https://openalex.org/W1508492714,"Abstract Chronic ethanol intoxication in rats accelerated the rate of ethanol metabolism, but decreased the of alcohol dehydrogenase. Chronic consumption of ethanol decreased the activities of cytochrome oxidase and succinic dehydrogenase in mitochondria and in cell-free homogenates, whereas total hepatic protein was not altered by ethanol feeding. Thus, total mitochondrial activity was decreased and cannot account for the increased rate of blood ethanol elearance. We therefore investigated the activities of enzymes and those of systems for the transport of reducing equivalents into mitochondria. Reconstituted malate-aspartate, fatty acid, and α-glycerophosphate shuttles were equally effective in transporting reducing equivalents into the mitochondria from ethanol-fed and control rats. The activities of enzymes involved in the shuttles, such as cytoplasmic and α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and glutamic oxalacetic transaminase, were either decreased or unchanged by chronic ethanol consumption. The permeability of the mitochondria to NADH and to substrate anions which participate in the shuttles was also not altered by ethanol feeding. It is therefore unlikely that the increased rates of ethanol oxidation produced by chronic ethanol consumption are caused by enhanced transport of reducing equivalents into the mitochondria. A high fat diet alone (35% of total calories) increased both the endogenous and total rates of shuttle activity, compared with the rates obtained with mitochondria from rats which had consumed a low fat diet. However, the rates of blood ethanol clearance were comparable in rats consuming high fat and low fat diets. Therefore, the transport of reducing equivalents into the mitochondria under these conditions does not appear to be rate-limiting for ethanol metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1534116154,"Abstract The adenylate cyclase system in a plasma membrane-rich fraction termed ghosts from rat adipocytes is activated by epinephrine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, glucagon, and secretin, and is also stimulated in the presence of fluoride ion. Studies of the temperature dependency of activation by these agents showed that whereas hormonal activation occurs down to 10°, activation by fluoride ion is minimal below 25°. When the enzyme system is incubated at temperatures below 25° with combinations of fluoride and each of the hormones, no hormonal activation is observed. At higher temperatures, enhanced activity observed in the presence of combinations of fluoride and hormones is probably due to fluoride alone. Thus fluoride abolishes hormonal activation of the adenylate cyclase system. The inhibitory effect of fluoride ion is independent of the concentration of the hormone. The inhibitory effect is also independent of the concentration of either ATP or magnesium ion in the assay system. The concentration dependency of the inhibitory effect is similar to that required for fluoride activation of the system. These observations provide the first evidence that fluoride exerts some effect on a process related to hormone action on adenylate cyclase. It is suggested that fluoride acts at some point on the pathway by which hormonal interaction with the receptor leads to an increase in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. This process may involve the coupling between the receptor and catalytic components of this complex enzyme system."
https://openalex.org/W1489176760,Abstract NAD was converted chemically to 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide through the Hofmann hypobromite reaction and the resulting dinucleotide was purified by means of ion exchange chromatography. Spectrophotometric and fluorometric properties of the analog were studied. The 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide was shown to be a competitive inhibitor in reactions catalyzed by seven NAD(P)-dependent enzymes. The 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide was diazotized with the use of nitrous acid. The diazotized derivative was shown to be a site-specific inactivator of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase. Diazotized 3-amino-1-methylpyridinium chloride was prepared and shown to be less effective in the inactivation of this enzyme.

Since comparable results were obtained with butyrated cyclic adenosine monophosphate derivatives as well as with the phosphodiesterase inhibitors quazodine and theophylline, it appears that cyclic adenosine monophosphate mediates this effect of thyrotropin.

https://openalex.org/W1607101514,"Abstract The presence of sialic acid on the polymorphonuclear (PMN) phagocyte is necessary for maximal stimulation of its phagocytic activity by the tetrapeptide, tuftsin, Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg. Treatment of polymorphonuclear cells with bacterial neuraminidases, purified by affinity chromatography, completely abolishes stimulation of phagocytic activity by free tuftsin or by tuftsin bound to the carrier leukokinin molecule. These enzymes cleave sialic acid at both 2-3' and 2-6' glycosidic bonds. By contrast, treatment of cells with influenza virus neuraminidase, which cleaves predominantly the 2-3' linkage, reduces the tuftsin effect by approximately 50%. Enzyme-treated cells remain viable and capable of phagocytosis. Cells treated with any of the neuraminidases and cells of the untreated controls show comparable levels of phagocytosis in the absence of tuftsin. While membrane sialic acid is necessary for stimulation of phagocytosis, it may function only as a binding site for the three positively charged residues of the tetrapeptide. Neuraminidases from Vibrio cholerae or Clostridium perfringens, in excess amounts, released in 2 hours a maximum of about 135 million molecules of sialic acid per polymorphonuclear cell. Under similar conditions, treatment with influenza virus released approximately 30 million molecules per cell."
https://openalex.org/W1584109119,"Abstract Picolinimidylation of one amino group per active site of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase increases the turnover numbers of the enzyme approximately 10-fold and other kinetic constants up to 140-fold at pH 8. The picolinimidylated enzyme shifts the absorption maximum of NADH to lower wave lengths, indicating that the amino group that can be modified is probably not involved in the spectral shift observed when NADH binds to native enzyme. Product and dead-end inhibition studies at pH 8 indicate that the mechanism of the modified enzyme conforms to an Ordered Bi Bi and not to a rapid equilibrium random mechanism. Stopped flow studies show that NAD+ binds 10 times more slowly to the modified enzyme than to the native enzyme and that NADH binds at about the same rate to both enzymes. Dissociation of NADH (5.6 s-1) is rate-limiting for the reaction of NAD+ and ethanol catalyzed by the native enzyme but was too fast to measure (g200 s-1) with the modified enzyme. The transfer of hydrogen from ethanol to NAD+ now controls the turnover (32 s-1) with the modified enzyme as shown by a deuterium isotope effect of 4.8 in the steady state reaction. The maximum velocity of the reaction of NAD+ and ethanol is dependent upon a group with a pK of 7.2; this group must be unprotonated for maximal activity and could be an imidazole. For the reaction of NADH and acetaldehyde, no isotope effect was observed and the turnover (550 s-1) may be limited by isomerization and dissociation of the enzyme-NAD+ complex."
https://openalex.org/W1605055573,Abstract Cobaltohemoglobin A binds oxygen cooperatively with a Hill coefficient of up to 2.3 and its p1/2 is found to be 91 mm. Its oxygen affinity is controlled by diphosphoglycerate which the protein binds very strongly. Cobaltohemoglobin A possesses only 40% of the alkaline Bohr effect of the native enzyme; carbon dioxide has no effect upon oxygen binding. The oxidation-reduction potential of cobaltohemoglobin A is +0.100 volt which is about 50 mv less positive than that of native hemoglobin. The electron paramagnetic resonance of the nitroxide spin label attached to the sulfhydryl groups of cys(92)β and the rates of reaction of these groups with paramercuribenzoate indicate that the heme crevice is more open near that residue. A detailed comparison of these properties with those of the native protein suggests subtle and intricate alterations of the quaternary structures of the oxy and deoxy species which result from substitution of the metal atom.

https://openalex.org/W1548591348,"Abstract Anthranilate synthetase of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus is a multimeric protein made up of two nonidentical subunits. It is not associated with anthranilate-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase, the second enzyme of the tryptophan pathway. Two classes of mutants lacking anthranilate synthetase activity are described. One is defective in the chorismate-binding subunit (E), although a normal glutamine-binding subunit (G) is produced. This class is incapable of catalyzing the anthranilate synthetase reaction. The second class is defective in the G subunit but produces an active E subunit. The second type of mutation results in a requirement for p-aminobenzoate in addition to anthranilate, suggesting a dual role for the G subunit in anthranilate and p-aminobenzoate synthesis. When extracts of the two mutant classes are mixed, normal E and G subunits can reassociate to form an active complex able to catalyze the synthesis of anthranilate. Wild type anthranilate synthetase complex is readily dissociated into E and G subunits by gel filtration through Sephadex G-100. Glycerol and glutamine stabilize the enzyme, glycerol affording complete protection while glutamine is less active. In addition to stabilizing enzyme activity, 30% glycerol enhances the association of subunits during gel filtration. Molecular weights of the individual subunits estimated from Sephadex G-100 column chromatography are 70,000 and 14,000 for the E and G subunits, respectively. The molecular weight of the anthranilate synthetase complex estimated in the presence of 30% glycerol is 86,000. Anthranilate synthetase subunits from A. calcoaceticus are capable of reassociating with those of Pseudomonas putida to form active hybrids which are approximately 50% as efficient as the native A. calcoaceticus enzyme in catalyzing anthranilate formation."
https://openalex.org/W1596721066,"Abstract The cytoplasm of Phytophthora palmivora is rich in soluble β-(1 → 3)-glucans of which two different types can be recognized. The glucans extracted from the mycelium are all neutral molecules. In the asexual reproductive stages (sporangia, zoospores, and cysts) neutral glucan is also present but the main component is a family of novel phosphoglucans. By ion exchange chromatography, five different phosphoglucan fractions were detected with glucose to phosphate ratios ranging from 33:1 to 18:1. The phosphate was largely removed from the phosphoglucans by phosphomonoesterases. Phosphodiesterase had no effect. On enzymatic dephosphorylation, all phosphoglucans yielded a neutral glucan similar to, if not identical with, the neutral glucan concurrently found in the cytoplasm. The mobility of phosphoglucans in gel filtration was highly affected by the ionic strength of the cluant. The phosphoglucans have an average degree of polymerization of ∼30 and contain one or two phosphate groups linked by monoester linkage to the C-6 hydroxyl of a glucose residue(s). The absence of phosphoglucans in the mycelium, their subsequent appearance in the sporangia, and their partial utilization by the zoospores during encystment suggest that these polymers may play a major role in the biochemistry of cellular differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1606706474,"Abstract Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase from human erythrocytes has been purified approximately 30,000-fold. The purified enzyme migrates as a single protein band on disc electrophoresis at pH 7.9 and 9.5. The protein forms an inactive precipitate in salt concentrations below 50 mm. Addition of 25% glycerol protects against this precipitation. ATP stimulates the enzymatic reaction but is not an obligatory substrate. When present, ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi. This hydrolysis is stoichiometric with nicotinate mononucleotide formation. In the presence of saturating concentrations of ATP, the apparent Km values for nicotinate and 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate are decreased from 24 to 0.5 µm and 100 to 5 µm, respectively. The enzyme is not an ATPase in the absence of any of the other substrates. Its molecular weight is 86,000 by gel filtration in the absence or presence of 1.0 mm MgATP."
https://openalex.org/W1587547084,"Abstract The measurement of the proton relaxation rate (1/T1) enhancement (e1*) for the concanavalin A (Con A)-Mn2+ complex as a function of time following the addition of Mn2+ indicates a pH-dependent rate of structural rearrangement at the bound Mn2+ site. The addition of excess Ca2+ interrupts this kinetic process and results in a reduced time-independent value of e1*. The further addition of α-methyl-d-glucoside to the Con A-Mn2+-Ca2+ complex also alters the observable e1*. Using the recently published 2 A resolution crystal structure of Con A, the results are interpreted as arising from the gradual folding of the loop of residues 12 to 22 over the initial Mn2+ binding site (formed by residues 8, 10, and 24) to close the Mn2+ off from free access by water molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1792657927,"Abstract The phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (l-phenylalanine: tRNA ligase [AMP]EC 6.1.1.b) from rat liver has been purified 1500-fold by the addition of hydroxylapatite chromatography to a previously developed procedure. From sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis the enzyme appears to be composed of two types of subunits with molecular weights of 74,500 and 69,000, respectively. Thermal inactivation appears to be associated with breakdown of the larger subunit. The effect of various ligands on the thermal inactivation of the enzyme was investigated. Triphosphates, in general, had a destabilizing effect with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) exerting the greatest influence on the rate of thermal decay of enzyme activity. It seems that the pyrophosphate moiety is responsible for the labilization in these cases since, under the same conditions, sodium pyrophosphate had an even greater effect on the thermal stability of the enzyme than ATP. The presence of magnesium ions reduced the effect of both of these substrates. In the presence of magnesium ion, phenylalanine protected against heat inactivation, but its thermal effect was additive with that of ATP, providing no evidence for the formation of an aminoacyl adenylate. Transfer RNAphe from rat liver and yeast also protected the enzyme against heat inactivation both in the absence and presence of magnesium. Studies with tRNAval, tRNAfmet, tRNAarg, and tRNAphe from Escherichia coli indicated that the amount of protection a tRNA afforded against heat inactivation was reflected in the extent to which it was chargeable by the enzyme, while those tRNAs which were not chargeable but still were bound to the enzyme seemed to strain the enzyme, thus increasing its heat lability."
https://openalex.org/W1988988549,"Serum dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity, a useful biochemical index of peripheral sympathetic nervous activity, was measured in rats treated with Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol or ethanol or both substances. After 7 days of treatment with either substance, serum dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity decreased significantly. Combined treatment with both agents enhanced the effects of each given alone. In rats subjected to immobilization stress, treatment with Delta(9)- tetrahydrocannabinol appeared to potentiate the stress-induced increase in serum enzyme activity. Treatment with ethanol, with or without Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, effectively blocked this increase in enzyme activity. These results show that both substances have significant effects on the sympathetic nervous system which are critically influenced by environmental setting."

https://openalex.org/W2151164810,"Abstract A cytochrome designated cytochrome b560 was extracted from Ascaris muscle at pH 4.5 with 0.3% aluminum sulfate and purified to a single electrophoretic species by carboxymethylcellulose (CM-52) chromatography, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and Sephadex G-75 chromatography. It displayed absorption bands at 560 (α-peak), 528 (β-peak), and 424.5 nm (γ-peak), with marked shoulders at 556 and 404 nm, in the reduced form, and at 562 (α-peak), 532 (β-peak), and 413 nm (γ-peak) in the oxidized form. At -196°, the reduced α-peak split into two sharp symmetrical bands at 560 and 552.5 nm (absolute spectrum) and at 559.5 and 552.5 nm (difference spectrum). The ratio of the absorbance at 560 nm (reduced) to 280 nm (oxidized) was 1.44, and that at 413 to 280 nm (oxidized) was 5.7. The molecular weight was estimated to be about 13,000 by Sephadex G-75 chromatography and the prosthetic group was a protoheme. The amino acid composition, assuming that there were 100 residues, was as follows: Asp11, Thr6, Ser4, Glu12, Pro6, Gly9, Ala7, Cys4, Val7, Ile3, Leu6, Tyr2, Phe3, Lys14, His3 and Arg3. Only a trace amount of methionine was detected. The cytochrome b560 was autoxidizable and did not bind with CO at pH 7.0."
https://openalex.org/W1559846119,"Abstract Solid phase peptide synthesis has been used to study structural requirements at the active site of staphylococcal nuclease-T', the noncovalent complex of the polypeptides nuclease-T-(6-48) and nuclease-T-(49-149) (residues 6 through 48 and 49 through 149 of native nuclease, respectively). In light of the importance of glutamic acid 43 in nuclease-T' catalysis (Chaiken, I. M., and Sanchez, G. R. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 6743–747), analogues of nuclease-T-(6-48) with progressively longer deletions at the COOH terminus have been synthesized, and their binding to native nuclease-T-(49-149) to produce an active complex has been investigated. The results indicate that residues glutamic acid 43, threonine 44, lysine 45, histidine 46, proline 47, and lysine 48 are not necessary for formation of a nuclease-T'-like complex. On the other hand, threonine 44 is critical for normal enzymic activity. The effect of threonine 44 appears to be due to its contribution to the peptide bond with glutamic acid 43 and not to its specific side chain moiety. The synthesis of an analogue of nuclease-T-(6-48) with alanine at position 19 in place of aspartic acid was also undertaken. No enzymic activity is generated by this peptide in the presence of nuclease-T-(49-149), although complex formation appears to occur. This finding is consistent with the view, based on the crystal structure of the nuclease-Ca++-deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate complex (Cotton, F. A., Bier, C. J., Day, V. W., Hazen, E. E., Jr., and Larsen, S. (1972) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 36, 243–249), that the side chain carboxyl group of aspartic acid 19, along with those of aspartic acid residues 21 and 40 and glutamic acid 43, participates in the binding of the essential calcium ion."

https://openalex.org/W1529281090,"Abstract A distinct change occurs in the molecular size of the enzyme, histidinol phosphate phosphatase, specified by nonsense mutants with lesions near the middle of hisB. The hisB gene of Salmonella typhimurium controls two different activities, imidazoleglycerolphosphate dehydratase and histidinol phosphate phosphatase, both of which reside in a single protein. The phosphatase activity from mutants with lesions distal to this transition point appears in or near the void volume of Sephadex G-200, whereas that from mutants with lesions proximal to the transition point produce a polypeptide with little or no activity. One mutant with its lesion near this transition point was chosen for further study. The phosphatase enzyme was purified from strain TR691, a non-complementing UGA hisB278 mutant. Two forms of the enzyme were found by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One form had a molecular weight of 38,000 and was a dimer of 18,000 molecular weight polypeptide chains as shown by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The other form of the enzyme had a molecular weight of 47,000 and was a dimer of dissimilar chains with molecular weights of 38,000 and 11,500. The pH optima for catalytic activity of both forms was 7.0 in the absence of MnCl2 and 6.5 in the presence of 1.0 mm MnCl2. The Km for histidinol phosphate was 0.83 mm and was unchanged by the addition of Mn2+, although the velocity at the pH optimum increased about 30%. No difference in the Ki between the two forms could be detected towards the competitive inhibitor, histidinol. The mutant enzymes had no imidazoleglycerolphosphate dehydratase activity and did not cleave p-nitrophenylphosphate. It is possible that the 38,000 molecular weight form is produced by limited proteolysis of the 47,000 molecular weight form. Preliminary experiments using trypsin and subtilisin NOVO did not show this conversion; however, the 11,500 molecular weight component appeared to be very sensitive to this treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1583611438,"Abstract Enzyme activities which attack the triphosphate termini of RNA products formed in the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase reactions have been isolated. Three distinct enzyme preparations have been partially purified from extracts of Escherichia coli which catalyze the following reactions: A. pppApYpZ....... → ppApYpZ....... + Pi B. pppXpYpZ....... → ppXpYpZ....... + Pi C. pppXpYpZ....... → HOXpYpZ....... + 3Pi The enzyme catalyzing Reaction A cleaves 5'-ATP-terminated RNA chains and will not cleave 5'-GTP-terminated RNA chains. The enzyme will also cleave the terminal phosphate of ATP and dATP; other nucleoside triphosphates are inactive. The enzyme catalyzing Reaction B will cleave the 5'-terminal phosphate group of both ATP- and GTP-terminated RNA chains as well as of other ribonucleoside triphosphates. In each case, the products of the reaction are Pi and either 5'-diphosphate-terminated RNA chains or nucleoside diphosphate. The enzyme catalyzing Reaction C is nonspecific and appears to be an acid phosphatase capable of removing phosphate groups at the 5' position of all nucleotides examined. A ribosome-dependent cleavage of the terminal phosphate of [γ-32P]GTP-terminated RNA products (32pppGpXpY....) to 32Pi has also been examined. This reaction is catalyzed by the combined action of an RNase and the elongation factor G in the presence of ribosomes. At high levels of elongation factor G, a ribosome-dependent release of 32Pi was observed independent of RNase."
