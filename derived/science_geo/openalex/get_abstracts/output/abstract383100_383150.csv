https://openalex.org/W2061244861,"Within the pseudogap phase of the high-Tc superconductors, it has been unclear which electronic symmetries (if any) are broken, what the identity of any associated order parameter might be, and which microscopic electronic degrees of freedom are active. Lawler et al. report the determination of a quantitative order parameter representing intra-unit cell nematicity — the breaking of rotational symmetry by the electronic structure within each CuO2 unit cell. They find electronic differences at the two oxygen sites within each unit cell. If the excitations seen by different techniques in the pseudogap phase all have the same origin, they would represent weakly magnetic states at the O sites, the electronic structure of which breaks a 90° rotational symmetry. In the high-transition-temperature superconductors, the pseudogap phase becomes predominant when the density of doped holes is reduced. In this phase it has been unclear which electronic symmetries (if any) are broken, what the identity of any associated order parameter might be, and which microscopic electronic degrees of freedom are active. Here, images of the intra-unit-cell states in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 + δ are studied, revealing electronic nematicity of the states close to the pseudogap energy. In the high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors the pseudogap phase becomes predominant when the density of doped holes is reduced1. Within this phase it has been unclear which electronic symmetries (if any) are broken, what the identity of any associated order parameter might be, and which microscopic electronic degrees of freedom are active. Here we report the determination of a quantitative order parameter representing intra-unit-cell nematicity: the breaking of rotational symmetry by the electronic structure within each CuO2 unit cell. We analyse spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunnelling microscope images of the intra-unit-cell states in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 + δ and, using two independent evaluation techniques, find evidence for electronic nematicity of the states close to the pseudogap energy. Moreover, we demonstrate directly that these phenomena arise from electronic differences at the two oxygen sites within each unit cell. If the characteristics of the pseudogap seen here and by other techniques all have the same microscopic origin, this phase involves weak magnetic states at the O sites that break 90°-rotational symmetry within every CuO2 unit cell."
https://openalex.org/W2008350311,"Diamonds are formed under high pressure more than 150 kilometres deep in the Earth's mantle and are brought to the surface mainly by volcanic rocks called kimberlites. Several thousand kimberlites have been mapped on various scales, but it is the distribution of kimberlites in the very old cratons (stable areas of the continental lithosphere that are more than 2.5 billion years old and 300 kilometres thick or more) that have generated the most interest, because kimberlites from those areas are the major carriers of economically viable diamond resources. Kimberlites, which are themselves derived from depths of more than 150 kilometres, provide invaluable information on the composition of the deep subcontinental mantle lithosphere, and on melting and metasomatic processes at or near the interface with the underlying flowing mantle. Here we use plate reconstructions and tomographic images to show that the edges of the largest heterogeneities in the deepest mantle, stable for at least 200 million years and possibly for 540 million years, seem to have controlled the eruption of most Phanerozoic kimberlites. We infer that future exploration for kimberlites and their included diamonds should therefore be concentrated in continents with old cratons that once overlay these plume-generation zones at the core-mantle boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2166504915,"Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) mariculture has been associated with epidemics of infectious diseases that threaten not only local production, but also wild fish coming into close proximity to marine pens and fish escaping from them. Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is a frequently fatal disease of farmed Atlantic salmon. First recognized in one farm in Norway in 1999[1], HSMI was subsequently implicated in outbreaks in other farms in Norway and the United Kingdom[2]. Although pathology and disease transmission studies indicated an infectious basis, efforts to identify an agent were unsuccessful. Here we provide evidence that HSMI is associated with infection with piscine reovirus (PRV). PRV is a novel reovirus identified by unbiased high throughput DNA sequencing and a bioinformatics program focused on nucleotide frequency as well as sequence alignment and motif analyses. Formal implication of PRV in HSMI will require isolation in cell culture and fulfillment of Koch's postulates, or prevention or modification of disease through use of specific drugs or vaccines. Nonetheless, as our data indicate that a causal relationship is plausible, measures must be taken to control PRV not only because it threatens domestic salmon production but also due to the potential for transmission to wild salmon populations."
https://openalex.org/W2037238525,"Topological surface states are a class of novel electronic states that are of potential interest in quantum computing or spintronic applications. Unlike conventional two-dimensional electron states, these surface states are expected to be immune to localization and to overcome barriers caused by material imperfection. Previous experiments have demonstrated that topological surface states do not backscatter between equal and opposite momentum states, owing to their chiral spin texture. However, so far there is no evidence that these states in fact transmit through naturally occurring surface defects. Here we use a scanning tunnelling microscope to measure the transmission and reflection probabilities of topological surface states of antimony through naturally occurring crystalline steps separating atomic terraces. In contrast to non-topological surface states of common metals (copper, silver and gold), which are either reflected or absorbed by atomic steps, we show that topological surface states of antimony penetrate such barriers with high probability. This demonstration of the extended nature of antimony's topological surface states suggests that such states may be useful for high current transmission even in the presence of atomic-scale irregularities-an electronic feature sought to efficiently interconnect nanoscale devices."

https://openalex.org/W2127923758,"Anthrax is a fatal disease caused by strains of Bacillus anthracis. Members of this monophyletic species are non motile and are all characterized by the presence of four prophages and a nonsense mutation in the plcR regulator gene. Here we report the complete genome sequence of a Bacillus strain isolated from a chimpanzee that had died with clinical symptoms of anthrax. Unlike classic B. anthracis, this strain was motile and lacked the four prohages and the nonsense mutation. Four replicons were identified, a chromosome and three plasmids. Comparative genome analysis revealed that the chromosome resembles those of non-B. anthracis members of the Bacillus cereus group, whereas two plasmids were identical to the anthrax virulence plasmids pXO1 and pXO2. The function of the newly discovered third plasmid with a length of 14 kbp is unknown. A detailed comparison of genomic loci encoding key features confirmed a higher similarity to B. thuringiensis serovar konkukian strain 97-27 and B. cereus E33L than to B. anthracis strains. For the first time we describe the sequence of an anthrax causing bacterium possessing both anthrax plasmids that apparently does not belong to the monophyletic group of all so far known B. anthracis strains and that differs in important diagnostic features. The data suggest that this bacterium has evolved from a B. cereus strain independently from the classic B. anthracis strains and established a B. anthracis lifestyle. Therefore we suggest to designate this isolate as “B. cereus variety (var.) anthracis”."
https://openalex.org/W2062325161,"There is solid evidence indicating that hyperphosphorylated tau protein, the main component of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles present in the brain of Alzheimer disease patients, plays a key role in progression of this disease. However, it has been recently reported that extracellular unmodified tau protein may also induce a neurotoxic effect on hippocampal neurons by activation of M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors. In the present work we show an essential component that links both effects, which is tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). This enzyme is abundant in the central nervous system and is mainly required to keep control of extracellular levels of phosphorylated compounds. TNAP dephosphorylates the hyperphosphorylated tau protein once it is released upon neuronal death. Only the dephosphorylated tau protein behaves as an agonist of muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors, provoking a robust and sustained intracellular calcium increase finally triggering neuronal death. Interestingly, activation of muscarinic receptors by dephosphorylated tau increases the expression of TNAP in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. An increase in TNAP activity together with increases in protein and transcript levels were detected in Alzheimer disease patients when they were compared with healthy controls."
https://openalex.org/W2154262751,"Connexin-assembled gap junctions (GJs) and hemichannels coordinate intercellular signaling processes. Although the regulation of connexins in GJs has been well characterized, the molecular determinants controlling connexin-hemichannel activity are unresolved. Here we investigated the regulation of Cx43-hemichannel activity by actomyosin contractility and intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) using plasma membrane-permeable TAT peptides (100 µM) designed to interfere with interactions between the cytoplasmic loop (CL) and carboxy-terminal (CT) in primary bovine corneal endothelial cells and HeLa, C6 glioma, and Xenopus oocytes ectopically expressing Cx43. Peptides corresponding to the last 10 CT aa (TAT-Cx43CT) prevented the inhibition of Cx43-hemichannel activity by contractility/high [Ca2+]i, whereas a reverse peptide (TAT-Cx43CTrev) did not. These effects were independent of zonula occludens-1, a cytoskeletal-associated Cx43-binding protein. In contrast, peptides corresponding to CL (TAT-L2) inhibited Cx43-hemichannel responses, whereas a mutant peptide (TAT-L2H126K/I130N) did not inhibit. In these assays, TAT-Cx43CT acted as a scaffold for TAT-L2 and vice versa, a finding supported by surface plasmon resonance measurements. Loop/tail interactions appeared essential for Cx43-hemichannel activity, because TAT-Cx43CT restored the activity of nonfunctional hemichannels, consisting of either Cx43 lacking the C-terminal tail (Cx43M239) or intact Cx43 ectopically expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We conclude that intramolecular loop/tail interactions control Cx43-hemichannel activity, laying the basis for developing hemichannel-specific blockers.—Ponsaerts, R., De Vuyst, E., Retamal, M., D'hondt, C., Vermeire, D., Wang, N., De Smedt, H., Zimmermann, P., Himpens, B., Vereecke, J., Leybaert, L., Bultynck, G.

https://openalex.org/W2071259051,"Background Exercise is an extreme physiological challenge for skeletal muscle energy metabolism and has notable health benefits. We aimed to identify and characterize metabolites, which are components of the regulatory network mediating the beneficial metabolic adaptation to exercise. Methodology and Principal Findings First, we investigated plasma from healthy human subjects who completed two independent running studies under moderate, predominantly aerobic conditions. Samples obtained prior to and immediately after running and then 3 and 24 h into the recovery phase were analyzed by a non-targeted (NT-) metabolomics approach applying liquid chromatography-qTOF-mass spectrometry. Under these conditions medium and long chain acylcarnitines were found to be the most discriminant plasma biomarkers of moderately intense exercise. Immediately after a 60 min (at 93% VIAT) or a 120 min run (at 70% VIAT) a pronounced, transient increase dominated by octanoyl-, decanoyl-, and dodecanoyl-carnitine was observed. The release of acylcarnitines as intermediates of partial β-oxidation was verified in skeletal muscle cell culture experiments by probing 13C-palmitate metabolism. Further investigations in primary human myotubes and mouse muscle tissue revealed that octanoyl-, decanoyl-, and dodecanoyl-carnitine were able to support the oxidation of palmitate, proving more effective than L-carnitine. Conclusions Medium chain acylcarnitines were identified and characterized by a functional metabolomics approach as the dominating biomarkers during a moderately intense exercise bout possessing the power to support fat oxidation. This physiological production and efflux of acylcarnitines might exert beneficial biological functions in muscle tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1999715679,"The CCR4-CAF1-NOT complex is a major cytoplasmic deadenylation complex in yeast and mammals. This complex associates with RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs to repress translation of target mRNAs. We sought to determine how CCR4 and CAF1 participate in repression and control of maternal mRNAs using Xenopus laevis oocytes. We show that Xenopus CCR4 and CAF1 enzymes are active deadenylases and repress translation of an adenylated mRNA. CAF1 also represses translation independent of deadenylation. The deadenylation-independent repression requires a 5' cap structure on the mRNA; however, deadenylation does not. We suggest that mere recruitment of CAF1 is sufficient for repression, independent of deadenylation."
https://openalex.org/W2010394656,"Background Proper function of the mammalian brain relies on the establishment of highly specific synaptic connections among billions of neurons. To understand how complex neural circuits function, it is crucial to precisely describe neuronal connectivity and the distributions of synapses to and from individual neurons. Methods and Findings In this study, we present a new genetic synaptic labeling method that relies on expression of a presynaptic marker, synaptophysin-GFP (Syp-GFP) in individual neurons in vivo. We assess the reliability of this method and use it to analyze the spatial patterning of synapses in developing and mature cerebellar granule cells (GCs). In immature GCs, Syp-GFP is distributed in both axonal and dendritic regions. Upon maturation, it becomes strongly enriched in axons. In mature GCs, we analyzed synapses along their ascending segments and parallel fibers. We observe no differences in presynaptic distribution between GCs born at different developmental time points and thus having varied depths of projections in the molecular layer. We found that the mean densities of synapses along the parallel fiber and the ascending segment above the Purkinje cell (PC) layer are statistically indistinguishable, and higher than previous estimates. Interestingly, presynaptic terminals were also found in the ascending segments of GCs below and within the PC layer, with the mean densities two-fold lower than that above the PC layer. The difference in the density of synapses in these parts of the ascending segment likely reflects the regional differences in postsynaptic target cells of GCs. Conclusions The ability to visualize synapses of single neurons in vivo is valuable for studying synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity within individual neurons as well as information flow in neural circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2137363045,"Clock genes and their protein products regulate circadian rhythms in mammals but have also been implicated in various physiological processes, including bone formation. Osteoblasts build new mineralized bone whereas osteoclasts degrade it thereby balancing bone formation. To evaluate the contribution of clock components in this process, we investigated mice mutant in clock genes for a bone volume phenotype.We found that Per2(Brdm1) mutant mice as well as mice lacking Cry2(-/-) displayed significantly increased bone volume at 12 weeks of age, when bone turnover is high. Per2(Brdm1) mutant mice showed alterations in parameters specific for osteoblasts whereas mice lacking Cry2(-/-) displayed changes in osteoclast specific parameters. Interestingly, inactivation of both Per2 and Cry2 genes leads to normal bone volume as observed in wild type animals. Importantly, osteoclast parameters affected due to the lack of Cry2, remained at the level seen in the Cry2(-/-) mutants despite the simultaneous inactivation of Per2.This indicates that Cry2 and Per2 affect distinct pathways in the regulation of bone volume with Cry2 influencing mostly the osteoclastic cellular component of bone and Per2 acting on osteoblast parameters."
https://openalex.org/W1978074814,"In conflict tasks such as the Stroop, the Eriksen flanker or the Simon task, it is generally observed that the detection of conflict in the current trial reduces the impact of conflicting information in the subsequent trial; a phenomenon termed conflict adaptation. This higher-order cognitive control function has been assumed to be restricted to cases where conflict is experienced consciously. In the present experiment we manipulated the awareness of conflict-inducing stimuli in a metacontrast masking paradigm to directly test this assumption. Conflicting response tendencies were elicited either consciously (through primes that were weakly masked) or unconsciously (strongly masked primes). We demonstrate trial-by-trial conflict adaptation effects after conscious as well as unconscious conflict, which could not be explained by direct stimulus/response repetitions. These findings show that unconscious information can have a longer-lasting influence on our behavior than previously thought and further stretch the functional boundaries of unconscious cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2161244480,"Background Circulating progenitor cells (CPC) contribute to the homeostasis of the vessel wall, and a reduced CPC count predicts cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We tested the hypothesis that CPC count improves cardiovascular risk stratification and that this is modulated by low-grade inflammation. Methodology/Principal Findings We pooled data from 4 longitudinal studies, including a total of 1,057 patients having CPC determined and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) collected. We recorded cardiovascular risk factors and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level. Risk estimates were derived from Cox proportional hazard analyses. CPC count and/or hsCRP level were added to a reference model including age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, prevalent CVD, chronic renal failure (CRF) and medications. The sample was composed of high-risk individuals, as 76.3% had prevalent CVD and 31.6% had CRF. There were 331 (31.3%) incident MACE during an average 1.7±1.1 year follow-up time. CPC count was independently associated with incident MACE even after correction for hsCRP. According to C-statistics, models including CPC yielded a non-significant improvement in accuracy of MACE prediction. However, the integrated discrimination improvement index (IDI) showed better performance of models including CPC compared to the reference model and models including hsCRP in identifying MACE. CPC count also yielded significant net reclassification improvements (NRI) for CV death, non-fatal AMI and other CV events. The effect of CPC was independent of hsCRP, but there was a significant more-than-additive interaction between low CPC count and raised hsCRP level in predicting incident MACE. Conclusions/Significance In high risk individuals, a reduced CPC count helps identifying more patients at higher risk of MACE over the short term, especially in combination with a raised hsCRP level."
https://openalex.org/W2169972181,"Depot-dependent differences in adipose tissue physiology may reflect specialized functions and local interactions between adipocytes and surrounding tissues. We combined time-resolved microarray analyses of mesenteric- (MWAT), subcutaneous- (SWAT) and epididymal adipose tissue (EWAT) during high-fat feeding of male transgenic ApoE3Leiden mice with histology, targeted lipidomics and biochemical analyses of metabolic pathways to identify differentially regulated processes and site-specific functions. EWAT was found to exhibit physiological zonation. De novo lipogenesis in fat proximal to epididymis was stably low, whereas de novo lipogenesis distal to epididymis and at other locations was down-regulated in response to high-fat diet. The contents of linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid in EWAT were increased compared to other depots. Expression of the androgen receptor (Ar) was higher in EWAT than in MWAT and SWAT. We suggest that Ar may mediate depot-dependent differences in de novo lipogenesis rate and propose that accumulation of linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid in EWAT is favored by testosterone-mediated inhibition of de novo lipogenesis and may promote further elongation and desaturation of these polyunsaturated fatty acids during spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2153252925,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a genetically heterogeneous disease, which to date remains fatal. Finding a common mechanism for initiation and progression of MM continues to be challenging. By means of integrative genomics, we identified an underexpressed gene signature in MM patient cells compared to normal counterpart plasma cells. This profile was enriched for previously defined H3K27-tri-methylated genes, targets of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins in human embryonic fibroblasts. Additionally, the silenced gene signature was more pronounced in ISS stage III MM compared to stage I and II. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay on purified CD138+ cells from four MM patients and on two MM cell lines, we found enrichment of H3K27me3 at genes selected from the profile. As the data implied that the Polycomb-targeted gene profile would be highly relevant for pharmacological treatment of MM, we used two compounds to chemically revert the H3K27-tri-methylation mediated gene silencing. The S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor 3-Deazaneplanocin (DZNep) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589 (Panobinostat), reactivated the expression of genes repressed by H3K27me3, depleted cells from the PRC2 component EZH2 and induced apoptosis in human MM cell lines. In the immunocompetent 5T33MM in vivo model for MM, treatment with LBH589 resulted in gene upregulation, reduced tumor load and increased overall survival. Taken together, our results reveal a common gene signature in MM, mediated by gene silencing via the Polycomb repressor complex. The importance of the underexpressed gene profile in MM tumor initiation and progression should be subjected to further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2004855985,"Neuroticism is a moderately heritable personality trait considered to be a risk factor for developing major depression, anxiety disorders and dementia. We performed a genome-wide association study in 2,235 participants drawn from a population-based study of neuroticism, making this the largest association study for neuroticism to date. Neuroticism was measured by the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. After Quality Control, we analysed 430,000 autosomal SNPs together with an additional 1.2 million SNPs imputed with high quality from the Hap Map CEU samples. We found a very small effect of population stratification, corrected using one principal component, and some cryptic kinship that required no correction. NKAIN2 showed suggestive evidence of association with neuroticism as a main effect (p<10−6) and GPC6 showed suggestive evidence for interaction with age (p≈10−7). We found support for one previously-reported association (PDE4D), but failed to replicate other recent reports. These results suggest common SNP variation does not strongly influence neuroticism. Our study was powered to detect almost all SNPs explaining at least 2% of heritability, and so our results effectively exclude the existence of loci having a major effect on neuroticism."
https://openalex.org/W2079782815,"Myelinating Schwann cells (SCs) are highly plastic cells that are able to dedifferentiate and re-enter the cell cycle. However, the molecular signals controlling dedifferentiation are not completely understood. Because a connection between mitogenic signaling and myelin loss has been suggested, we investigated the role of cAMP, a strong inducer of the myelinating phenotype, and mitogenic factors activating receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) on SC dedifferentiation. We herein provide evidence indicating that cAMP was required to not only initiate but also maintain a state of differentiation because SCs rapidly dedifferentiated and became competent to resume proliferation upon the removal of cAMP stimulation. Surprisingly, isolated SCs could undergo multiple cycles of differentiation and dedifferentiation upon cAMP addition and removal, respectively, in the absence of mitogenic factors and without entering the cell cycle. Conversely, the activation of RTKs and the ERK cascade by a variety of growth factors, including neuregulin, was not sufficient to initiate dedifferentiation in the presence of cAMP. Importantly, a reduction of cAMP triggered dedifferentiation through a mechanism that required JNK, rather than ERK, activity and an induction of the expression of c-Jun, a transcriptional inhibitor of myelination. In summary, the reversible transition from an undifferentiated to a myelinating state was dependent on cAMP but independent of RTK signaling and cell cycle progression, further indicating that dedifferentiation and proliferation are uncoupled and differentially regulated events in SCs."
https://openalex.org/W2149016416,"Stem cell transplantation holds great promise for the treatment of myocardial infarction injury. We recently described the embryonic stem cell-derived cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) capable of differentiating into cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelium, and smooth muscle. In this study, we hypothesized that transplanted CPCs will preserve function of the infarcted heart by participating in both muscle replacement and neovascularization. Differentiated CPCs formed functional electromechanical junctions with cardiomyocytes in vitro and conducted action potentials over cm-scale distances. When transplanted into infarcted mouse hearts, CPCs engrafted long-term in the infarct zone and surrounding myocardium without causing teratomas or arrhythmias. The grafted cells differentiated into cross-striated cardiomyocytes forming gap junctions with the host cells, while also contributing to neovascularization. Serial echocardiography and pressure-volume catheterization demonstrated attenuated ventricular dilatation and preserved left ventricular fractional shortening, systolic and diastolic function. Our results demonstrate that CPCs can engraft, differentiate, and preserve the functional output of the infarcted heart."
https://openalex.org/W2169725989,"Background Several decision support systems have been developed to interpret HIV-1 drug resistance genotyping results. This study compares the ability of the most commonly used systems (ANRS, Rega, and Stanford's HIVdb) to predict virological outcome at 12, 24, and 48 weeks. Methodology/Principal Findings Included were 3763 treatment-change episodes (TCEs) for which a HIV-1 genotype was available at the time of changing treatment with at least one follow-up viral load measurement. Genotypic susceptibility scores for the active regimens were calculated using scores defined by each interpretation system. Using logistic regression, we determined the association between the genotypic susceptibility score and proportion of TCEs having an undetectable viral load (<50 copies/ml) at 12 (8–16) weeks (2152 TCEs), 24 (16–32) weeks (2570 TCEs), and 48 (44–52) weeks (1083 TCEs). The Area under the ROC curve was calculated using a 10-fold cross-validation to compare the different interpretation systems regarding the sensitivity and specificity for predicting undetectable viral load. The mean genotypic susceptibility score of the systems was slightly smaller for HIVdb, with 1.92±1.17, compared to Rega and ANRS, with 2.22±1.09 and 2.23±1.05, respectively. However, similar odds ratio's were found for the association between each-unit increase in genotypic susceptibility score and undetectable viral load at week 12; 1.6 [95% confidence interval 1.5–1.7] for HIVdb, 1.7 [1.5–1.8] for ANRS, and 1.7 [1.9–1.6] for Rega. Odds ratio's increased over time, but remained comparable (odds ratio's ranging between 1.9–2.1 at 24 weeks and 1.9–2.2 at 48 weeks). The Area under the curve of the ROC did not differ between the systems at all time points; p = 0.60 at week 12, p = 0.71 at week 24, and p = 0.97 at week 48. Conclusions/Significance Three commonly used HIV drug resistance interpretation systems ANRS, Rega and HIVdb predict virological response at 12, 24, and 48 weeks, after change of treatment to the same extent."
https://openalex.org/W1989891419,"Mutations in the C terminus of titin, situated at the M-band of the striated muscle sarcomere, cause tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) type 2J. Mutations in the protease calpain 3 (CAPN3), in turn, lead to LGMD2A, and secondary CAPN3 deficiency in LGMD2J suggests that the pathomechanisms of the diseases are linked. Yeast two-hybrid screens carried out to elucidate the molecular pathways of TMD/LGMD2J and LGMD2A resulted in the identification of myospryn (CMYA5, cardiomyopathy-associated 5) as a binding partner for both M-band titin and CAPN3. Additional yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed both interactions. The interaction of myospryn and M-band titin was supported by localization of endogenous and transfected myospryn at the M-band level. Coexpression studies showed that myospryn is a proteolytic substrate for CAPN3 and suggested that myospryn may protect CAPN3 from autolysis. Myospryn is a muscle-specific protein of the tripartite motif superfamily, reported to function in vesicular trafficking and protein kinase A signaling and implicated in the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The novel interactions indicate a role for myospryn in the sarcomeric M-band and may be relevant for the molecular pathomechanisms of TMD/LGMD2J and LGMD2A."
https://openalex.org/W1968739010,"A functional polymorphism located at -1 from the start codon of the CD40 gene, rs1883832, was previously reported to disrupt a Kozak sequence essential for translation. It has been consistently associated with Graves' disease risk in populations of different ethnicity and genetic proxies of this variant evaluated in genome-wide association studies have shown evidence of an effect in rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility. However, the protective allele associated with Graves' disease or rheumatoid arthritis has shown a risk role in MS, an effect that we aimed to replicate in the present work. We hypothesized that this functional polymorphism might also show an association with other complex autoimmune condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, given the CD40 overexpression previously observed in Crohn's disease (CD) lesions.Genotyping of rs1883832C>T was performed in 1564 MS, 1102 CD and 969 ulcerative colitis (UC) Spanish patients and in 2948 ethnically matched controls by TaqMan chemistry.The observed effect of the minor allele rs1883832T was replicated in our independent Spanish MS cohort [p = 0.025; OR (95% CI) = 1.12 (1.01-1.23)]. The frequency of the minor allele was also significantly higher in CD patients than in controls [p = 0.002; OR (95% CI) = 1.19 (1.06-1.33)]. This increased predisposition was not detected in UC patients [p = 0.5; OR (95% CI) = 1.04 (0.93-1.17)].The impact of CD40 rs1883832 on MS and CD risk points to a common signaling shared by these autoimmune conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2019819938,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked postnatal neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and one of the leading causes of mental retardation in females. RTT is characterized by psychomotor retardation, purposeless hand movements, autistic-like behavior and abnormal gait. We studied the effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on the phenotypic manifestations of a RTT mouse model that lacks MeCP2 (Mecp2(-/y)).We found that EE delayed and attenuated some neurological alterations presented by Mecp2(-/y) mice and prevented the development of motor discoordination and anxiety-related abnormalities. To define the molecular correlate of this beneficial effect of EE, we analyzed the expression of several synaptic marker genes whose expression is increased by EE in several mouse models.We found that EE induced downregulation of several synaptic markers, suggesting that the partial prevention of RTT-associated phenotypes is achieved through a non-conventional transcriptional program."
https://openalex.org/W2088515466,"In the event of a terrorist-mediated attack in the United States using radiological or improvised nuclear weapons, it is expected that hundreds of thousands of people could be exposed to life-threatening levels of ionizing radiation. We have recently shown that genome-wide expression analysis of the peripheral blood (PB) can generate gene expression profiles that can predict radiation exposure and distinguish the dose level of exposure following total body irradiation (TBI). However, in the event a radiation-mass casualty scenario, many victims will have heterogeneous exposure due to partial shielding and it is unknown whether PB gene expression profiles would be useful in predicting the status of partially irradiated individuals. Here, we identified gene expression profiles in the PB that were characteristic of anterior hemibody-, posterior hemibody- and single limb-irradiation at 0.5 Gy, 2 Gy and 10 Gy in C57Bl6 mice. These PB signatures predicted the radiation status of partially irradiated mice with a high level of accuracy (range 79–100%) compared to non-irradiated mice. Interestingly, PB signatures of partial body irradiation were poorly predictive of radiation status by site of injury (range 16–43%), suggesting that the PB molecular response to partial body irradiation was anatomic site specific. Importantly, PB gene signatures generated from TBI-treated mice failed completely to predict the radiation status of partially irradiated animals or non-irradiated controls. These data demonstrate that partial body irradiation, even to a single limb, generates a characteristic PB signature of radiation injury and thus may necessitate the use of multiple signatures, both partial body and total body, to accurately assess the status of an individual exposed to radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2035790540,"Recent studies have indicated that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) isolated from particular bacterial strains can bias innate immune responses toward different signal transduction pathways thereby eliciting unique patterns of cytokines. Heterogeneity in the structure of lipid A (the active component of LPS) and possible contaminations with other inflammatory components have made it difficult to confirm these observations and dissect molecular motifs that may be responsible for modulatory properties. To address these issues, we have examined, for the first time, the ability of a range of well defined synthetic lipid As and isolated LPS and lipid A preparations to induce the production of a wide range of cytokines in three different mouse cell types. It was found that, for a given compound, the potencies of production of the various cytokines differed significantly. An additive model, in which a chemical change in the structure of a compound effects the potencies of all cytokines in the same manner, could describe the potencies of the cytokines for all compounds. Thus, no evidence was found that the structure of lipid A can modulate the pattern of cytokine production. In addition, the statistical analysis showed that the relative ordering of the potencies of the compounds was identical in the different cell types and that structural features such as the presence of a 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid moiety, anomeric phosphate, lipid length, and acylation pattern were important for pro-inflammatory activity. Finally, it was found that transcriptional and post-transcription control mechanisms determine potencies and efficacies of cytokine production in cell-specific manners. Recent studies have indicated that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) isolated from particular bacterial strains can bias innate immune responses toward different signal transduction pathways thereby eliciting unique patterns of cytokines. Heterogeneity in the structure of lipid A (the active component of LPS) and possible contaminations with other inflammatory components have made it difficult to confirm these observations and dissect molecular motifs that may be responsible for modulatory properties. To address these issues, we have examined, for the first time, the ability of a range of well defined synthetic lipid As and isolated LPS and lipid A preparations to induce the production of a wide range of cytokines in three different mouse cell types. It was found that, for a given compound, the potencies of production of the various cytokines differed significantly. An additive model, in which a chemical change in the structure of a compound effects the potencies of all cytokines in the same manner, could describe the potencies of the cytokines for all compounds. Thus, no evidence was found that the structure of lipid A can modulate the pattern of cytokine production. In addition, the statistical analysis showed that the relative ordering of the potencies of the compounds was identical in the different cell types and that structural features such as the presence of a 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid moiety, anomeric phosphate, lipid length, and acylation pattern were important for pro-inflammatory activity. Finally, it was found that transcriptional and post-transcription control mechanisms determine potencies and efficacies of cytokine production in cell-specific manners. The innate immune system is an evolutionarily ancient system designed to detect the presence of microbial invaders and activate protective reactions (1Beutler B. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 845-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). It responds rapidly to unique molecules that are integral parts of pathogens and are perceived as danger signals by the host. Recognition of these molecular patterns is mediated by sets of highly conserved receptors (2van Amersfoort E.S. Van Berkel T.J. Kuiper J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 16: 379-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), whose activation results in acute inflammatory responses. These responses include the production of a diverse set of cytokines and chemokines, direct local attack against the invading pathogen, and initiation of responses that activate and regulate the adaptive immune system (3Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar, 4Dabbagh K. Lewis D.B. Curr. Opin. Infect.

Evidence is emerging that innate immune responses can be exploited for therapeutic purposes such as the development of adjuvants for vaccines and the treatment of a wide range of diseases, including asthma, infections, and cancer (8Parkinson T. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2008; 10: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar, 9O'Neill L.A. Bryant C.E. Doyle S.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 2009; 61: 177-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). An important concern of such therapies is, however, that over-activation of innate immune responses may lead to the clinical symptoms of septic shock (10Rice T.W. Bernard G.R. Annu. Rev. Med. 2005; 56: 225-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, an important issue for the design of safe immune modulators is detailed knowledge of structure-activity relationships to harness beneficial effects without causing toxicity.

LPS consists of a hydrophobic domain known as lipid A, a non-repeating core oligosaccharide, and a distal polysaccharide (11Caroff M. Karibian D. Cavaillon J.M. Haeffner-Cavaillon N. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 915-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3382) Google Scholar). Studies employing chemically synthesized lipid A have unequivocally demonstrated that lipid A is the inflammation-inducing moiety of LPS (13Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Rietschel E.T. Westphal O. Brade H.

Although LPS-induced cellular activation through TLR4/MD2 is complex as many signaling elements are involved, it appears that there are two distinct initiation points in the signaling process, depending upon the recruitment of the adaptor proteins myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) or Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-β (TRIF). The MyD88-dependent pathway leads to early activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, and Th1 cell responses. The TRIF-dependent pathway induces phosphorylation and dimerization of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-3, resulting in IFN-β production, which in turn activates the signal transducer and activation of transcription 1 pathway leading to the production of mediators such as nitric oxide (3Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar, 15Karaghiosoff M. Steinborn R. Kovarik P. Kriegshäuser G. Baccarini M. Donabauer B. Reichart U. Kolbe T. Bogdan C. Leanderson T. Levy D. Decker T. Müller M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). An interplay between the MyD88 and TRIF signaling pathways has been demonstrated by microarray studies that examined LPS-induced changes in gene expression profiles of macrophages isolated from wild-type, MYD88−/−, TRIF−/−, and MYD88−/− TRIF−/− mice (16Björkbacka H. Fitzgerald K.A. Huet F. Li X. Gregory J.A. Lee M.A. Ordija C.M. Dowley N.E. Golenbock D.T. Freeman M.W. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 19: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 17Hirotani T. Yamamoto M. Kumagai Y. Uematsu S. Kawase I. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Results from those studies demonstrated that LPS-inducible genes are completely abrogated in the MYD88−/− TRIF−/− mice; these genes can be classified into clusters based on their dependence on MyD88 and/or TRIF for expression. The cluster of genes regulated primarily by MyD88 included genes commonly associated with pro-inflammatory responses (e.g. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). The cluster that was dependent on both MyD88 and TRIF included IL-1α and IL-12A, and the cluster that was dependent primarily on TRIF included the IFN-inducible genes IFN-β, interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), and RANTES. Of the naturally occurring lipid A structures examined thus far, the vast majority contains a lipid backbone consisting of a β(1–6)-linked d-glucosamine or 2,3-diamino-2,3-di-deoxy-glucosamine in either homo- or hetero-dimeric combinations. However, striking structural differences in lipid As of different bacteria occur in the degree of phosphorylation and patterns of acylation. These structural differences account for the highly variable in vivo and in vitro responses to LPS (12Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3382) Google Scholar, 13Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Rietschel E.T. Westphal O. Brade H. Brade L. Freudenberg M. Schade U. Imoto M. Yoshimura H.

However, the results of more recent studies (21Salkowski C.A. Detore G.R. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3239-3247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22van der Ley P. Steeghs L.

Science. 2007; 316: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) suggest that relationships between lipid A structure and biological responses are more complex, and cell culture, in vivo and ex vivo studies have indicated that LPS or lipooligosaccharide (LOS) isolated from particular bacterial strains can preferentially induce MyD88- or TRIF-dependent cytokines. Heterogeneity in the structure of lipid A within a particular bacterial strain and possible contamination with other inflammatory components of the bacterial cell wall have complicated the use of either LPS or lipid A isolated from bacteria to dissect the molecular mechanisms responsible for the biological responses to specific lipid A molecules. To address this important issue, we have examined a range of well defined synthetic lipid As (28Zhang Y. Gaekwad J. Wolfert M.A. Boons G.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5200-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Zhang Y. Gaekwad J. Wolfert M.A. Boons G.J. Chem. Eur.

The particular synthetic compounds were selected because previous studies had implicated their LPSs in biasing innate immune responses toward MyD88- or TRIF-dependent pathways (21Salkowski C.A. Detore G.R. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3239-3247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22van der Ley P. Steeghs L. Hamstra H.J. ten Hove J. Zomer B. van Alphen L. Infect.

Furthermore, synthetic chemistry makes it possible to obtain well defined lipid As that are free of other inflammatory components with complete control over fatty acid acylation and phosphorylation patterns. The synthetic compounds used in this study have structural modifications in the pattern and lengths of the lipid chains, presence of phosphate at the C-1 position, and presence of a dimeric 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (KDO) moiety at the C-6′ position (see Fig. 1). LPS from E. coli, LOS from N. meningitidis, and isolated lipid A from S. minnesota R595 (MPLA) have also been examined. E. coli 055:B5 LPS and E. coli 0111:B4 LPS (ultrapure) were obtained from List Biological Laboratories, meningococcal LOS was kindly provided by Dr. R. Carlson (Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Athens, GA), and lipid A from S. minnesota R595 (MPLA) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. The synthesis of synthetic lipid A derivatives 1–8 has been reported elsewhere (28Zhang Y. Gaekwad J. Wolfert M.A. Boons G.J. J. Am. Chem.

The monoclonal antibody to human/mouse IL-1β (3ZD) was from NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, NIH, the monoclonal antibody to β-actin conjugated to HRP was from Abcam Inc., and the Mouse Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses RT2 Profiler PCR Array was from SABiosciences. The primer pairs for mRNA quantification were designed using the Universal ProbeLibrary (Roche Applied Science) and were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (supplemental Table S1). RAW 264.7 γNO(−) cells, derived from the RAW 264.7 mouse monocyte/macrophage cell line, were obtained from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (ATCC) with l-glutamine (2 mm), adjusted to contain sodium bicarbonate (1.5 g/liter), glucose (4.5 g/liter), HEPES (10 mm), and sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml, Mediatech) and FBS (10%, HyClone). BAC1.2F5 macrophages were kindly provided by Dr. E. R. Stanley (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, NY) and maintained in 75% MEM Alpha 1× (Cellgro) with Earle's salts and supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and FBS (10%) and 25% Eagle's minimum essential medium (ATCC) supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and FBS (10%) conditioned medium (as a source of growth factor CSF-1). Dendritic cells (DCs) were prepared from mouse bone marrow cultures as previously described (31Inaba K. Inaba M. Romani N. Aya H. Deguchi M. Ikehara S. Muramatsu S. Steinman R.M. J. Exp.

Immunother. 2003; 26: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, freshly isolated bone marrow cells from C57BL/6J mice were grown for 7 days in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker/Cambrex) with l-glutamine (2 mm), adjusted to contain sodium pyruvate (1 mm), non-essential amino acids (1×), 2-mercaptoethanol (50 μm), and supplemented with penicillin (25 units/ml)/streptomycin (25 μg/ml), gentamicin (12.5 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (125 ng/ml). Furthermore, FCS (10%), rhFlt3L (25 ng/ml), rmIL-6 (25 ng/ml), and stem cell factor (25 ng/ml) were added to the medium. Next, the proliferated bone marrow cells were grown for 1 day in the same medium, but with the following additions: mouse serum (1%), recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (10 ng/ml), rmIL-4 (10 ng/ml) to obtain mature DCs. All cells were maintained in a humid 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. On the day of the exposure assay RAW 264.7 γNO(−) and BAC1.2F5 cells were plated as 2 × 105 cells/well in 180 μl and 3.4 × 104 cells/well in 180 μl, respectively, in 96-well tissue culture plates (Nunc). Cells were then incubated with different stimuli (20 μl, 10×) for 5.5 h and 24 h in replicates of six to give a final volume of 200 μl/well. Culture supernatants were then collected; two replicates of each sample were pooled to give final replicates of three and stored frozen (−80 °C) until assayed for cytokine production. After removal of the supernatant, cells were lysed by adding PBS containing Tween 20 (0.01%) and BSA (1%) in the same volume as that of the supernatant and sonicating for 5 min. In a similar way as that of the supernatants, the cell lysates of two replicates were pooled to give three final replicates and stored frozen (−80 °C) until assayed for cytokine production. For estimation of IL-1β secretion in BAC1.2F5 macrophages, supernatants were removed after 24-h incubation with compounds and replaced with the same volume of medium containing ATP (5 mm, Sigma). After re-incubation for 30 min supernatants were harvested. Similarly, on the day of the exposure assay mature DCs were plated as 4 × 106 cells/well in 1800 μl in 24-well tissue culture plates. Cells were then incubated with different stimuli (200 μl, 10×) for 5.5 h and 24 h in a final volume of 2 ml/well. Culture supernatants and cell lysates were then collected and stored frozen (−80 °C). All cytokine ELISAs were performed in 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Nalge Nunc International). Cytokine DuoSet ELISA Development Kits (R&D Systems) were used for the cytokine quantification of mouse TNF-α, IP-10, RANTES, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with wavelength correction set to 540 nm using a microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Concentrations of mouse IFN-β in culture supernatants were determined as follows. Plates were coated with rabbit polyclonal antibody against mouse IFN-β (PBL Biomedical Laboratories). IFN-β in standards (PBL Biomedical Laboratories) and samples was allowed to bind to the immobilized antibody. Rat anti-mouse IFN-β antibody (USBiological) was then added. Next, HRP-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) antibody (Pierce) and a chromogenic substrate for HRP 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Pierce) were added. After the reaction was stopped, the absorbance was measured at 450 nm with wavelength correction set to 540 nm. Cytokine values are expressed as picograms of cytokine/ml or as picograms of cytokine/μg of total protein. The total protein content in the cell lysates was assessed using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Biotechnology). Cytokine values are presented as the means ± S.D. of triplicate measurements, with each experiment being repeated three times. RAW 264.7 γNO(−) and BAC1.2F5 cells were plated as 2.6 × 106 cells/well in 1800 μl in 6-well tissue culture plates (Nunc) and incubated for 3–4 h. Cells were then incubated with different stimuli (200 μl, 10×) for 90 min, after which cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated using Absolutely RNA Miniprep kit (Strategene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated RNA (625 ng/50 μl) was subjected to cDNA synthesis using the TaqMan Reverse Transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). The expression of selected genes in each cDNA sample was determined by quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR Green technology (Bio-Rad). Briefly, reaction mixtures (5-μl total volume) containing iQTMSYBR Green 2X Supermix (2.5 μl, Bio-Rad), forward and reverse primers (400 nm each, IDT), and cDNA (5 ng) were overlaid by Vapor-Lock (8 μl, Corbett Research), and the PCR reaction was carried out at 95 °C for 3 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min using a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Melting curves were performed each time from 55 °C to 95 °C with increments of 0.5 °C for 5 s to ensure that only one amplification product was formed. For the quantitation of gene expression, 18 S rRNA, Gusb, Actin-β, and Hsp90ab1 were used as endogenous controls. Relative quantification with the obtained data was performed using the comparative (ΔΔCt) method, whereby the amount of target, normalized to an endogenous reference, and relative to a calibrator is given by the arithmetic formula: 2−ΔΔCt. cDNA samples were assayed in triplicates with each experiment repeated three times. For the Mouse Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses RT2 Profiler PCR Array, cDNA was synthesized using the RT2 First Strand kit (SABiosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, isolated RNA (1 μg) was subjected to genomic DNA elimination and cDNA synthesis using the RT mixture (10 μl) and incubations at 42 °C for 15 min and 95 °C for 5 min. Next, cDNA was added to a reaction mixture (final volume of 2550 μl) containing SABiosciences RT2 qPCR mastermix 2× (1275 μl). The reaction mixture was transferred to the PCR array (25 μl/well) and overlaid with Vapor-Lock (8 μl), and the PCR reaction was carried out as described above. Concentration-response data were analyzed using non-linear least-squares curve fitting in Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc). These data were fit with the following three-parameter logistic equation: Y = Emax/(1 + (EC50/X)), where Y is the cytokine response, X is the logarithm of the concentration of the stimulus, Emax is the maximum response, and EC50 is the concentration of the stimulus producing 50% stimulation. The log(EC50) and S.E. values of log(EC50) calculated by Prism were used for further statistical analysis via an additive model: log[EC50(i,j)] = μ + α(i) + β(j) + e(i,j), where μ represents the grand mean, α(i) are deviations about μ due to effects of the compounds, β(j) are deviations about μ due to variations between the cytokines, and e(i,j) are random errors. The validity of the additive model was examined by computing Z-scores; Z(i,j) = (Obs(i,j) − Exp(i,j))/S.E.(i,j), for all pairs of compounds(i) and cytokines(j), where Obs(i,j) are the values observed in the experiment, Exp(i,j) are the expected values under the additive model, and S.E.(i,j) are the standard errors as determined by Prism. The data were analyzed by modified weighted ANOVA to calculate the least square means estimates for compounds and cytokines. The cytokines and compounds were separated into groups by significance calculated using a Fisher's protected least significant difference (LSD) procedure at α = 0.05. For comparisons between two groups, the data were analyzed using the two-tailed Student t test with 95% confidence interval. A p value <0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. We have employed the synthetic lipid A derivatives 1–8 (Fig. 1) corresponding to different bacterial species to study the structure-activity relationship for TLR4 activation. It was anticipated that analysis of potencies and efficacies of the mediators would establish whether structural differences in lipid A show a bias toward either a MyD88- or TRIF-dependent pathway. Lipid A derivatives 1 and 2, which are hexa-acylated in an asymmetrical manner and contain two phosphate residues, are derived from E. coli (18Darveau R.P. Curr. Opin.

https://openalex.org/W2032935584,"The completion of the rice genome sequence has made it possible to identify and characterize new genes and to perform comparative genomics studies across taxa. The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene superfamily encoding for NAD(P)(+)-dependent enzymes is found in all major plant and animal taxa. However, the characterization of plant ALDHs has lagged behind their animal- and prokaryotic-ALDH homologs. In plants, ALDHs are involved in abiotic stress tolerance, male sterility restoration, embryo development and seed viability and maturation. However, there is still no structural property-dependent functional characterization of ALDH protein superfamily in plants. In this paper, we identify members of the rice ALDH gene superfamily and use the evolutionary nesting events of retrotransposons and protein-modeling-based structural reconstitution to report the genetic and molecular and structural features of each member of the rice ALDH superfamily in abiotic/biotic stress responses and developmental processes. Our results indicate that rice-ALDHs are the most expanded plant ALDHs ever characterized. This work represents the first report of specific structural features mediating functionality of the whole families of ALDHs in an organism ever characterized."
https://openalex.org/W2044996838,"The plasma membrane transporters for the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine modulate the dynamics of these monoamine neurotransmitters. Thus, activity of these transporters has significant consequences for monoamine activity throughout the brain and for a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Gene knockout (KO) mice that reduce or eliminate expression of each of these monoamine transporters have provided a wealth of new information about the function of these proteins at molecular, physiological and behavioral levels. In the present work we use the unique properties of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to probe the effects of altered dopaminergic dynamics on meso-scale neuronal circuitry and overall brain morphology, since changes at these levels of organization might help to account for some of the extensive pharmacological and behavioral differences observed in dopamine transporter (DAT) KO mice. Despite the smaller size of these animals, voxel-wise statistical comparison of high resolution structural MR images indicated little morphological change as a consequence of DAT KO. Likewise, proton magnetic resonance spectra recorded in the striatum indicated no significant changes in detectable metabolite concentrations between DAT KO and wild-type (WT) mice. In contrast, alterations in the circuitry from the prefrontal cortex to the mesocortical limbic system, an important brain component intimately tied to function of mesolimbic/mesocortical dopamine reward pathways, were revealed by manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI). Analysis of co-registered MEMRI images taken over the 26 hours after introduction of Mn2+ into the prefrontal cortex indicated that DAT KO mice have a truncated Mn2+ distribution within this circuitry with little accumulation beyond the thalamus or contralateral to the injection site. By contrast, WT littermates exhibit Mn2+ transport into more posterior midbrain nuclei and contralateral mesolimbic structures at 26 hr post-injection. Thus, DAT KO mice appear, at this level of anatomic resolution, to have preserved cortico-striatal-thalamic connectivity but diminished robustness of reward-modulating circuitry distal to the thalamus. This is in contradistinction to the state of this circuitry in serotonin transporter KO mice where we observed more robust connectivity in more posterior brain regions using methods identical to those employed here."
https://openalex.org/W2016254634,"Monoclonal antibody-based therapies have made an important contribution to current treatment strategies for cancer and autoimmune disease. However, the cost for these new drugs puts a significant strain on the healthcare economy, resulting in limited availability for patients. Therapeutic vaccination, defined as induction of immunity against a disease-related self-molecule, is therefore an attractive alternative. To analyze the potential of such an approach, we have developed a vaccine against the extra domain-B (ED-B) of fibronectin. This 91-aa domain, inserted by alternative splicing, is expressed during vasculogenesis in the embryo, but essentially undetectable under normal conditions in the adult. However, ED-B is highly expressed around angiogenic vasculature, such as in tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to break self-tolerance and induce a strong antibody response against ED-B by vaccination. Nineteen of 20 vaccinated mice responded with production of anti-ED-B antibodies and displayed a 70% reduction in tumor size compared to those lacking anti-ED-B antibodies. Analysis of the tumor tissue revealed that immunization against ED-B induced several changes, consistent with an attack by the immune system. These data show that tumor vascular antigens are highly interesting candidates for development of therapeutic vaccines targeting solid tumors.—Huijbers, E. J.

https://openalex.org/W2100161861,"Fetal conditions can in principle be affected by the mother's genotype working through the prenatal environment.Genotypes for 1536 SNPs in 357 cleft candidate genes were available from a previous analysis in which we focused on fetal gene effects. After data-cleaning, genotypes for 1315 SNPs in 334 autosomal genes were available for the current analysis of maternal gene effects. Two complementary statistical methods, TRIMM and HAPLIN, were used to detect multi-marker effects in population-based samples from Norway (562 case-parent and 592 control-parent triads) and Denmark (235 case-parent triads). We analyzed isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (iCL/P) and isolated cleft palate only (iCP) separately and assessed replication by looking for genes detected in both populations by both methods. In iCL/P, neither TRIMM nor HAPLIN detected more genes than expected by chance alone; furthermore, the selected genes were not replicated across the two methods. In iCP, however, FLNB was identified by both methods in both populations. Although HIC1 and ZNF189 did not fully satisfy our stringency criterion for replication, they were strongly associated with iCP in TRIMM analyses of the Norwegian triads.Except for FLNB, HIC1 and ZNF189, maternal genes did not appear to influence the risk of clefting in our data. This is consistent with recent epidemiological findings showing no apparent difference between mother-to-offspring and father-to-offspring recurrence of clefts in these two populations. It is likely that fetal genes make the major genetic contribution to clefting risk in these populations, but we cannot rule out the possibility that maternal genes can affect risk through interactions with specific teratogens or fetal genes."
https://openalex.org/W2060718243,"Background Eukaryotic cells have developed surveillance mechanisms to prevent the expression of aberrant transcripts. An early surveillance checkpoint acts at the transcription site and prevents the release of mRNAs that carry processing defects. The exosome subunit Rrp6 is required for this checkpoint in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but it is not known whether Rrp6 also plays a role in mRNA surveillance in higher eukaryotes. Methodology/Principal Findings We have developed an in vivo system to study nuclear mRNA surveillance in Drosophila melanogaster. We have produced S2 cells that express a human β-globin gene with mutated splice sites in intron 2 (mut β-globin). The transcripts encoded by the mut β-globin gene are normally spliced at intron 1 but retain intron 2. The levels of the mut β-globin transcripts are much lower than those of wild type (wt) ß-globin mRNAs transcribed from the same promoter. We have compared the expression of the mut and wt β-globin genes to investigate the mechanisms that down-regulate the production of defective mRNAs. Both wt and mut β-globin transcripts are processed at the 3′, but the mut β-globin transcripts are less efficiently cleaved than the wt transcripts. Moreover, the mut β-globin transcripts are less efficiently released from the transcription site, as shown by FISH, and this defect is restored by depletion of Rrp6 by RNAi. Furthermore, transcription of the mut β-globin gene is significantly impaired as revealed by ChIP experiments that measure the association of the RNA polymerase II with the transcribed genes. We have also shown that the mut β-globin gene shows reduced levels of H3K4me3. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that there are at least two surveillance responses that operate cotranscriptionally in insect cells and probably in all metazoans. One response requires Rrp6 and results in the inefficient release of defective mRNAs from the transcription site. The other response acts at the transcription level and reduces the synthesis of the defective transcripts through a mechanism that involves histone modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2017785811,"α7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7-nAChR) form Ca2+-permeable homopentameric channels modulating cortical network activity and cognitive processing. They are located pre- and postsynaptically and are highly abundant in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons. It is unclear how α7-nAChRs are positioned in specific membrane microdomains, particularly in cultured neurons which are devoid of cholinergic synapses. To address this issue, we monitored by single particle tracking the lateral mobility of individual α7-nAChRs labeled with α-bungarotoxin linked to quantum dots in live rat cultured hippocampal interneurons. Quantitative analysis revealed different modes of lateral diffusion of α7-nAChR dependent on their subcellular localization. Confined receptors were found in the immediate vicinity of glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic densities, as well as in extrasynaptic clusters of α-bungarotoxin labeling on dendrites. α7-nAChRs avoided entering postsynaptic densities, but exhibited reduced mobility and long dwell times at perisynaptic locations, indicative of regulated confinement. Their diffusion coefficient was lower, on average, at glutamatergic than at GABAergic perisynaptic sites, suggesting differential, synapse-specific tethering mechanisms. Disruption of the cytoskeleton affected α7-nAChR mobility and cell surface expression, but not their ability to form clusters. Finally, using tetrodotoxin to silence network activity, as well as exposure to a selective α7-nAChR agonist or antagonist, we observed that α7-nAChRs cell surface dynamics is modulated by chronic changes in neuronal activity. Altogether, given their high Ca2+-permeability, our results suggest a possible role of α7-nAChR on interneurons for activating Ca2+-dependent signaling in the vicinity of GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2014055319,"Background There are a growing number of next-generation sequencing technologies. At present, the most cost-effective options also produce the shortest reads. However, even for prokaryotes, there is uncertainty concerning the utility of these technologies for the de novo assembly of complete genomes. This reflects an expectation that short reads will be unable to resolve small, but presumably abundant, repeats. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a simple model of repeat assembly, we develop and test a technique that, for any read length, can estimate the occurrence of unresolvable repeats in a genome, and thus predict the number of gaps that would need to be closed to produce a complete sequence. We apply this technique to 818 prokaryote genome sequences. This provides a quantitative assessment of the relative performance of various lengths. Notably, unpaired reads of only 150nt can reconstruct approximately 50% of the analysed genomes with fewer than 96 repeat-induced gaps. Nonetheless, there is considerable variation amongst prokaryotes. Some genomes can be assembled to near contiguity using very short reads while others require much longer reads. Conclusions Given the diversity of prokaryote genomes, a sequencing strategy should be tailored to the organism under study. Our results will provide researchers with a practical resource to guide the selection of the appropriate read length."
https://openalex.org/W1991465744,"Pregnancy coordinately alters the contractile properties of both vascular and uterine smooth muscles reducing systemic blood pressure and maintaining uterine relaxation. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying these pregnancy-induced adaptations have yet to be fully defined but are likely to involve changes in the expression of proteins regulating myosin phosphorylation. Here we show that smoothelin like protein 1 (SMTNL1) is a key factor governing sexual development and pregnancy induced adaptations in smooth and striated muscle. A primary target gene of SMTNL1 in these muscles is myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1). Deletion of SMTNL1 increases expression of MYPT1 30-40-fold in neonates and during development expression of both SMTNL1 and MYPT1 increases over 20-fold. Pregnancy also regulates SMTNL1 and MYPT1 expression, and deletion SMTNL1 greatly exaggerates expression of MYPT1 in vascular smooth muscle, producing a profound reduction in force development in response to phenylephrine as well as sensitizing the muscle to acetylcholine. We also show that MYPT1 is expressed in Type2a muscle fibers in mice and humans and its expression is regulated during pregnancy, suggesting unrecognized roles in mediating skeletal muscle plasticity in both species. Our findings define a new conserved pathway in which sexual development and pregnancy mediate smooth and striated muscle adaptations through SMTNL1 and MYPT1."
https://openalex.org/W2042717820,"MYH9 was recently identified as renal susceptibility gene (OR 3–8, p<10−8) for major forms of kidney disease disproportionately affecting individuals of African descent. The risk haplotype (E-1) occurs at much higher frequencies in African Americans (≥60%) than in European Americans (<4%), revealing a genetic basis for a major health disparity. The population distributions of MYH9 risk alleles and the E-1 risk haplotype and the demographic and selective forces acting on the MYH9 region are not well explored. We reconstructed MYH9 haplotypes from 4 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning introns 12–23 using available data from HapMap Phase II, and by genotyping 938 DNAs from the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP). The E-1 risk haplotype followed a cline, being most frequent within sub-Saharan African populations (range 50–80%), less frequent in populations from the Middle East (9–27%) and Europe (0–9%), and rare or absent in Asia, the Americas, and Oceania. The fixation indexes (FST) for pairwise comparisons between the risk haplotypes for continental populations were calculated for MYH9 haplotypes; FST ranged from 0.27–0.40 for Africa compared to other continental populations, possibly due to selection. Uniquely in Africa, the Yoruba population showed high frequency extended haplotype length around the core risk allele (C) compared to the alternative allele (T) at the same locus (rs4821481, iHs = 2.67), as well as high population differentiation (FST(CEU vs. YRI) = 0.51) in HapMap Phase II data, also observable only in the Yoruba population from HGDP (FST = 0.49), pointing to an instance of recent selection in the genomic region. The population-specific divergence in MYH9 risk allele frequencies among the world's populations may prove important in risk assessment and public health policies to mitigate the burden of kidney disease in vulnerable populations."
https://openalex.org/W2004815722,"Phospholamban (PLN) is an effective inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, which transports Ca(2+) into the SR lumen, leading to muscle relaxation. A mutation of PLN in which one of the di-arginine residues at positions 13 and 14 was deleted led to a severe, early onset dilated cardiomyopathy. Here we were interested in determining the cellular mechanisms involved in this disease-causing mutation.Mutations deleting codons for either or both Arg13 or Arg14 resulted in the mislocalization of PLN from the ER. Our data show that PLN is recycled via the retrograde Golgi to ER membrane traffic pathway involving COP-I vesicles, since co-immunoprecipitation assays determined that COP I interactions are dependent on an intact di-arginine motif as PLN RDelta14 did not co-precipitate with COP I containing vesicles. Bioinformatic analysis determined that the di-arginine motif is present in the first 25 residues in a large number of all ER/SR Gene Ontology (GO) annotated proteins. Mutations in the di-arginine motif of the Sigma 1-type opioid receptor, the beta-subunit of the signal recognition particle receptor, and Sterol-O-acyltransferase, three proteins identified in our bioinformatic screen also caused mislocalization of these known ER-resident proteins.We conclude that PLN is enriched in the ER due to COP I-mediated transport that is dependent on its intact di-arginine motif and that the N-terminal di-arginine motif may act as a general ER retrieval sequence."

Of particular interest is the search for new inhibitors of metabolic routes exclusive of human pathogens, such as the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway essential for the viability of most human pathogenic bacteria and of the malaria parasite. Using atomic force microscopy single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), we have probed at the single-molecule level the interaction of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), which catalyzes the first step of the MEP pathway, with its two substrates, pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The data obtained in this pioneering SMFS analysis of a bisubstrate enzymatic reaction illustrate the substrate sequentiality in DXS activity and allow for the calculation of catalytic parameters with single-molecule resolution. The DXS inhibitor fluoropyruvate has been detected in our SMFS competition experiments at a concentration of 10 μM, improving by 2 orders of magnitude the sensitivity of conventional enzyme activity assays. The binding of DXS to pyruvate is a 2-step process with dissociation constants of k(off) = 6.1 × 10(-4) ± 7.5 × 10(-3) and 1.3 × 10(-2) ± 1.0 × 10(-2) s(-1), and reaction lengths of x(β) = 3.98 ± 0.33 and 0.52 ± 0.23 Å.

https://openalex.org/W2059607580,"A hallmark of genes that are subject to developmental regulation of transcriptional elongation is association of the negative elongation factor NELF with the paused RNA polymerase complex. Here we use a combination of biochemical and genetic experiments to investigate the in vivo function of NELF in the Drosophila embryo. NELF associates with different gene promoter regions in correlation with the association of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and the initial activation of gene expression during the early stages of embryogenesis. Genetic experiments reveal that maternally provided NELF is required for the activation, rather than the repression of reporter genes that emulate the expression of key developmental control genes. Furthermore, the relative requirement for NELF is dictated by attributes of the flanking cis-regulatory information. We propose that NELF-associated paused Pol II complexes provide a platform for high fidelity integration of the combinatorial spatial and temporal information that is central to the regulation of gene expression during animal development."
https://openalex.org/W2047688038,"Invasion of the mosquito salivary glands by Plasmodium is a critical step for malaria transmission. From a SAGE analysis, we previously identified several genes whose expression in salivary glands was regulated coincident with sporozoite invasion of salivary glands. To get insights into the consequences of these salivary gland responses, here we have studied one of the genes, PRS1 (Plasmodium responsive salivary 1), whose expression was upregulated in infected glands, using immunolocalization and functional inactivation approaches.PRS1 belongs to a novel insect superfamily of genes encoding proteins with DM9 repeat motifs of uncharacterized function. We show that PRS1 is induced in response to Plasmodium, not only in the salivary glands but also in the midgut, the other epithelial barrier that Plasmodium has to cross to develop in the mosquito. Furthermore, this induction is observed using either the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei or the human pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. In the midgut, PRS1 overexpression is associated with a relocalization of the protein at the periphery of invaded cells. We also find that sporozoite invasion of salivary gland cells occurs sequentially and induces intra-cellular modifications that include an increase in PRS1 expression and a relocalization of the corresponding protein into vesicle-like structures. Importantly, PRS1 knockdown during the onset of midgut and salivary gland invasion demonstrates that PRS1 acts as an agonist for the development of both parasite species in the two epithelia, highlighting shared vector/parasite interactions in both tissues.While providing insights into potential functions of DM9 proteins, our results reveal that PRS1 likely contributes to fundamental interactions between Plasmodium and mosquito epithelia, which do not depend on the specific Anopheles/P. falciparum coevolutionary history."
https://openalex.org/W2052905844,"In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the TOR (target of rapamycin) and PKA (protein kinase A) signaling transduction pathways regulate the expression of genes required for cell growth and sexual differentiation in response to the nutritional environment. Inhibition of Tor2 signaling results in the induction of genes involved in sexual differentiation, and the cells undergo mating and meiosis, even under good nutritional conditions. The same phenotype is observed in mutants in which the PKA pathway is inactive. By contrast, Tor2 overexpression or mutations that hyperactivate PKA signaling impair sexual differentiation, even under poor nutritional conditions. Accordingly, a very important question is to understand the molecular mechanism by which these two pathways coordinately regulate gene expression in response to nutrients.Here we demonstrate that TOR and PKA pathways operate coordinately to negatively regulate sexual differentiation by inhibiting the nuclear accumulation of the Ste11 transcription factor. However, the Tor2 pathway is unable to block the nuclear localization of Ste11 under good nutritional conditions when the PKA pathway is inactive. Using microarray analyses, we found that both pathways inhibit sexual differentiation by blocking ste11-dependent gene expression.We conclude that both the PKA and the TOR pathways inhibit Ste11 nuclear accumulation to repress Ste11-dependent gene expression. However, the PKA pathway plays a quantitatively more important role than the TOR pathway in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2150963738,"The transcriptional activity of nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs) relies on the association/dissociation of coregulators at the ligand-binding domain. However, we determined that the N-terminal domain (NTD) also plays a role through its phosphorylation, and we isolated vinexinβ, a cytoskeleton protein with three SH3 domains, as a new partner of the RARγ NTD. Here we deciphered the mechanism of the interaction and its role in RARY-mediated transcription. By combining molecular and biophysical (surface plasmon resonance, NMR, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer) approaches, we demonstrated that the third SH3 domain of vinexinβ interacts with a proline-rich domain (PRD) located in RARγ NTD and that phosphorylation at a serine located in the PRD abrogates the interaction. The affinity of the interaction was also evaluated. In vivo, vinexinβ represses RARγ-mediated transcription and we dissected the underlying mechanism in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments performed with F9 cells expressing RARγ wild type or mutated at the phosphorylation site. In the absence of retinoic acid (RA), vinexinβ does not occupy RARγ target gene promoters and sequesters non-phosphorylated RARγ out of promoters. In response to RA, RARγ becomes phosphorylated and dissociates from vinexinγ. This separation allows RARγ to occupy promoters.

https://openalex.org/W1987717980,"Copines are highly conserved proteins with lipid-binding activities found in animals, plants, and protists. They contain two calcium-dependent phospholipid binding C2 domains at the amino terminus and a VWA domain at the carboxyl terminus. The biological roles of most copines are not understood and the biochemical properties required for their functions are largely unknown. The Arabidopsis copine gene BON1/CPN1 is a negative regulator of cell death and defense responses. Here we probed the potential biochemical activities of BON1 through mutagenic studies. We found that mutations of aspartates in the C2 domains did not alter plasma membrane localization but compromised BON1 activity. Mutation at putative myristoylation residue glycine 2 altered plasma membrane localization of BON1 and rendered BON1 inactive. Mass spectrometry analysis of BON1 further suggests that the N-peptide of BON1 is modified. Furthermore, mutations that affect the interaction between BON1 and its functional partner BAP1 abolished BON1 function. This analysis reveals an unanticipated regulation of copine protein localization and function by calcium and lipid modification and suggests an important role in protein-protein interaction for the VWA domain of copines."
https://openalex.org/W2056525941,"One way animals may cope with nutrient deprivation is to broadly repress translation by inhibiting 5'-cap initiation. However, under these conditions specific proteins remain essential to survival during fasting. Such peptides may be translated through initiation at 5'UTR Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRES). Here we show that the Drosophila melanogaster Forkhead box type O (dFoxO) transcription factor is required for adult survival during fasting, and that the 5'UTR of dfoxO has the ability to initiate IRES-mediated translation in cell culture. Previous work has shown that insulin negatively regulates dFoxO through AKT-mediated phosphorylation while dFoxO itself induces transcription of the insulin receptor dInR, which also harbors IRES. Here we report that IRES-mediated translation of both dFoxO and dInR is activated in fasted Drosophila S2 cells at a time when cap-dependent translation is reduced. IRES mediated translation of dFoxO and dInR may be essential to ensure function and sensitivity of the insulin signaling pathway during fasting."

No associations between CAG or GGN repeat length and regional BMC or BMD were observed after adjusting for age. Whole body and regional BMC and BMD values were similar in men harboring CAG(S), CAG(L), GGN(S) or GGN(L) AR repeat polymorphisms.

https://openalex.org/W2029889940,"GIPC1/synectin, a single PDZ domain-containing protein, binds to numerous proteins and is involved in multiple biological processes, including cell migration. We reported previously that MyoGEF, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, plays a role in regulating breast cancer cell polarization and invasion. Here, we identify GIPC1 as an interacting partner of MyoGEF. Both in vitro and in vivo binding assays show that the GIPC1 PDZ domain binds to the PDZ-binding motif at the C terminus of MyoGEF. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that GIPC1 and MyoGEF colocalize to the cell leading edge. Depletion of GIPC1 by RNAi in MDA-MB-231 cells causes cells to shift from a polarized to a rounded morphology. Matrigel invasion assays show that RNAi-mediated depletion of GIPC1 dramatically decreases MDA-MB-231 cell invasion. Notably, an anti-MyoGEF peptide antibody, whose epitope is located at the C terminus of MyoGEF, interferes with GIPC1-MyoGEF complex formation. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with the anti-MyoGEF peptide antibody disrupts cell polarization and invasion.

https://openalex.org/W2009840433,"Background Pathogen recognition by dendritic cells (DC) is crucial for the initiation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Activation of Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) by microbial molecular patterns leads to the maturation of DC, which present the antigen and activate T cells in secondary lymphoid tissues. Cytokine production by DC is critical for shaping the adaptive immune response by regulating T helper cell differentiation. It was previously shown by our group that Src kinases play a key role in cytokines production during TLR4 activation in human DC. Principal Findings In this work we investigated the role of Src kinases during different TLRs triggering in human monocyte-derived DC (MoDC). We found that Src family kinases are important for a balanced production of inflammatory cytokines by human MoDC upon stimulation of TLR3 and 8 with their respective agonists. Disruption of this equilibrium through pharmacological inhibition of Src kinases alters the DC maturation pattern. In particular, while expression of IL-12 and other inflammatory cytokines depend on Src kinases, the induction of IL-23 and co-stimulatory molecules do not. Accordingly, DC treated with Src inhibitors are not compromised in their ability to induce CD4 T cell proliferation and to promote the Th17 subset survival but are less efficient in inducing Th1 differentiation. Conclusions We suggest that the pharmacological modulation of DC maturation has the potential to shape the quality of the adaptive immune response and could be exploited for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases."

However, the roles and significance of the two isoforms in excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling remains to be elucidated.In this study, we expressed either or both alpha-RyR and beta-RyR in 1B5 RyR-deficient myotubes using the herpes simplex virus 1 helper-free amplicon system. Immunological characterizations revealed that alpha-RyR and beta-RyR are appropriately expressed and targeted at the junctions in 1B5 myotubes. In Ca(2+) imaging studies, each isoform exhibited caffeine-induced Ca(2+) transients, an indicative of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR). However, the fashion of Ca(2+) release events was fundamentally different: alpha-RyR mediated graded and sustained Ca(2+) release observed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, whereas beta-RyR supported all-or-none type regenerative Ca(2+) oscillations and waves. alpha-RyR but not beta-RyR exhibited Ca(2+) transients triggered by membrane depolarization with high [K(+)](o) that were nifedipine-sensitive, indicating that only alpha-RyR mediates depolarization-induced Ca(2+) release. Myotubes co-expressing alpha-RyR and beta-RyR demonstrated high [K(+)](o)-induced Ca(2+) transients which were indistinguishable from those with myotubes expressing alpha-RyR alone. Furthermore, procaine did not affect the peak height of high [K(+)](o)-induced Ca(2+) transients, suggesting minor amplification of Ca(2+) release by beta-RyR via CICR in 1B5 myotubes.These findings suggest that alpha-RyR and beta-RyR provide distinct intracellular Ca(2+) signals in a myogenic cell line. These distinct properties may also occur in frog skeletal muscle and will be important for E-C coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2154902479,"Background Methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) are repair enzymes that protect proteins from oxidative stress by catalyzing stereospecific reduction of oxidized methionine residues. MsrB1 is a selenocysteine-containing cytosolic/nuclear Msr with high expression in liver and kidney. Principal Findings Here, we identified differences in MsrB1 gene structure among mammals. Human MsrB1 gene consists of four, whereas the corresponding mouse gene of five exons, due to occurrence of an additional intron that flanks the stop signal and covers a large part of the 3′-UTR. This intron evolved in a subset of rodents through intronization of exonic sequences, whereas the human gene structure represents the ancestral form. In mice, both splice forms were detected in liver, kidney, brain and heart with the five-exon form being the major form. We found that both mRNA forms were translated and supported efficient selenocysteine insertion into MsrB1. In addition, MsrB1 occurs in two protein forms that migrate as 14 and 5 kDa proteins. We found that each mRNA splice form generated both protein forms. The abundance of the 5 kDa form was not influenced by protease inhibitors, replacement of selenocysteine in the active site or mutation of amino acids in the cleavage site. However, mutation of cysteines that coordinate a structural zinc decreased the levels of 5 and 14 kDa forms, suggesting importance of protein structure for biosynthesis and/stability of these forms. Conclusions This study characterized unexpected diversity of protein and mRNA forms of mammalian selenoprotein MsrB1."
