https://openalex.org/W2157860216,"Sirtuins catalyze NAD+-dependent protein deacetylation and are critical regulators of transcription, apoptosis, metabolism, and aging. There are seven human sirtuins (SIRT1–7), and SIRT1 has been implicated as a key mediator of the pathways downstream of calorie restriction that have been shown to delay the onset and reduce the incidence of age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Increasing SIRT1 activity, either by transgenic overexpression of the Sirt1 gene in mice or by pharmacological activation by small molecule activators resveratrol and SRT1720, has shown beneficial effects in rodent models of type 2 diabetes, indicating that SIRT1 may represent an attractive therapeutic target. Herein, we have assessed purported SIRT1 activators by employing biochemical assays utilizing native substrates, including a p53-derived peptide substrate lacking a fluorophore as well as the purified native full-length protein substrates p53 and acetyl-CoA synthetase1. SRT1720, its structurally related compounds SRT2183 and SRT1460, and resveratrol do not lead to apparent activation of SIRT1 with native peptide or full-length protein substrates, whereas they do activate SIRT1 with peptide substrate containing a covalently attached fluorophore. Employing NMR, surface plasmon resonance, and isothermal calorimetry techniques, we provide evidence that these compounds directly interact with fluorophore-containing peptide substrates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SRT1720 neither lowers plasma glucose nor improves mitochondrial capacity in mice fed a high fat diet. SRT1720, SRT2183, SRT1460, and resveratrol exhibit multiple off-target activities against receptors, enzymes, transporters, and ion channels. Taken together, we conclude that SRT1720, SRT2183, SRT1460, and resveratrol are not direct activators of SIRT1.

The seven members of the mammalian sirtuin family, SIRT1–7, each with distinct cellular localizations, act on their respective targets to effect a wide range of biological processes (4.Smith B.C.

The sirtuins regulate their targets by modulating the activity of their partner proteins through reversible deacetylation (5.Sauve A.A. Wolberger C. Schramm V.L. Boeke J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 435-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The most widely studied sirtuin, SIRT1, is homologous to yeast Sir2, which was initially discovered as maintaining the acetylation state of histones in heterochromatin, thereby controlling gene expression. Since then, the discovery of numerous and diverse sirtuin substrates has implicated the sirtuins in metabolism, apoptosis, transcription, and cell survival (2.Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N.

Sir2 deacetylases catalyze the NAD+-dependent deacetylation of specific ϵ-amino-acetylated lysine residues from its protein substrates to form nicotinamide, the deacetylated product, and a unique metabolite, 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The biochemical and kinetic mechanism of Sir2 deacetylases has been extensively studied (15.Borra M.T. Langer M.R. Slama J.T. Denu J.M.

Pharmacological activation of SIRT1 by the small molecule activator resveratrol has been reported to improve insulin sensitivity, increase mitochondrial content, and prolong survival of mice fed a high fat, high calorie diet (24.Baur J.A.

Furthermore, SIRT1 activation by transgenic overexpression of the Sirt1 gene in mice has shown similar phenotypes (27.Banks A.S. Kon N. Knight C. Matsumoto M. Gutiérrez-Juárez R. Rossetti L. Gu W. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 333-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), indicating that SIRT1 may represent an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. SRT1720, SRT2183, and SRT1460 were recently described by Sirtris Pharmaceuticals as SIRT1 activators (26.Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S. Carney D.P. Smith J.J. Gagne D.J. Jin L. Boss O. Perni R.B.

Westphal C.H. Nature. 2007; 450: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). They are structurally unrelated to resveratrol and were reported to activate SIRT1 with potencies 1,000-fold greater than resveratrol. These compounds were identified via a high throughput fluorescence polarization assay followed by potency optimization for in vitro enzyme activity using high throughput mass spectrometry (MS). They were shown to exhibit EC1.5 (the compound concentration required to increase enzyme activity by 50%) of 0.16–2.9 μm, with 296–781% activation (when compared with 201% for resveratrol). As with other plant polyphenols such as resveratrol, the mechanism of SIRT1 activation by the Sirtris series was shown to occur through increased binding affinity by decreasing the Km of SIRT1 for acetylated peptide substrate without affecting the Km for NAD+ or the Vmax. SRT1720, the most potent activator of the series, was reported to improve glucose homeostasis, increase insulin sensitivity, and increase mitochondrial function in rodent models of type 2 diabetes (26.Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S. Carney D.P. Smith J.J. Gagne D.J. Jin L. Boss O. Perni R.B. Vu C.B. Bemis J.E. Xie R. Disch J.S. Ng P.Y. Nunes J.J. Lynch A.V. Yang H. Galonek H. Israelian K. Choy W.

The SIRT1 activation by the aforementioned Sirtris series was determined only with a non-native fluorophore-containing p53-derived peptide substrate in both fluorescence polarization and MS assays. Recently, SIRT1 activation by resveratrol was shown to be completely dependent on the presence of a covalently attached fluorophore in the fluorescent peptide substrate (28.Borra M.T. Smith B.C. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17187-17195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 29.Kaeberlein M. McDonagh T. Heltweg B. Hixon J. Westman E.A. Caldwell S.D.

These results suggested that the resveratrol-mediated in vivo effects may occur through a different molecular mechanism independent of direct SIRT1 activation and raised questions about the Sirtris series of compounds and their ability to activate human SIRT1 in vitro. In the present study, to avoid any potential artifacts associated with fluorescently labeled non-native substrates, we have investigated the ability of the Sirtris series and resveratrol in activating human SIRT1 using a native peptide substrate by direct detection and quantification methods such as HPLC. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that the fluorophore may mimic a hydrophobic residue/pocket on the native full-length protein substrates, and therefore, the full-length substrates will behave differently from a peptide substrate. We report the first assessment of these putative SIRT1 activators on two native full-length substrates, p53 and acetyl-CoA synthetase1 (AceCS1). Herein, we report that neither the Sirtris series nor resveratrol activate SIRT1 in these native systems. Through biophysical studies, we provide additional evidence that the Sirtris compounds interact directly with fluorophore-containing peptide substrates with micromolar binding affinities even in the absence of SIRT1. In contrast to the previous report (26.Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S. Carney D.P. Smith J.J. Gagne D.J. Jin L. Boss O. Perni R.B. Vu C.B. Bemis J.E. Xie R. Disch J.S. Ng P.Y. Nunes J.J. Lynch A.V. Yang H. Galonek H. Israelian K. Choy W. Iffland A. Lavu S. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Olefsky J.M. Jirousek M.R. Elliott P.J. Westphal C.H. Nature. 2007; 450: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that SRT1720 neither lowers plasma glucose nor improves mitochondrial capacity in mice fed a high fat diet. We further demonstrate that the Sirtris series and resveratrol are highly promiscuous as they interact with multiple unrelated targets including receptors, enzymes, ion channels, and transporters. Taken together, these data suggest that SRT1720, SRT2183, SRT1460, and resveratrol are not direct SIRT1 activators. SRT1720, SRT2183, and SRT1460 were synthesized according to published procedures (26.Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S. Carney D.P. Smith J.J. Gagne D.J. Jin L. Boss O. Perni R.B. Vu C.B. Bemis J.E. Xie R. Disch J.S. Ng P.Y. Nunes J.J. Lynch A.V. Yang H. Galonek H. Israelian K. Choy W. Iffland A. Lavu S. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Olefsky J.M. Jirousek M.R. Elliott P.J. Westphal C.H. Nature. 2007; 450: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). EX-527 (6-chloro-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1-H-carbazole-1-carboxamide) and resveratrol were purchased from Tocris Biosciences and Sigma, respectively. All compounds were stored as dry powders at room temperature in a nitrogen box and dissolved in DMSO to prepare concentrated stock solutions. Tris acetate and Triton X-100 were obtained from Research Organics and Calbiochem, respectively. HPLC solvents were from J.T. Baker. The p53-derived peptides, TAMRA-p53 peptide and native p53 peptide, were custom-synthesized by CPC Scientific, whereas 2,3-TAMRA was purchased from Molecular Probes. The amino acid sequence of all peptides used in the present study is summarized in supplemental Table S1. All reagents used were the highest quality commercially available. Acetyl-CoA synthetase1 (AceCS1) and acetylated acetyl-CoA synthetase1 (Ac-AeCS1) were provided by Dr. John Denu (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. An Agilent 1100 HPLC system was used in all HPLC experiments, and data were processed by the Agilent ChemStation software. The Escherichia coli codon-optimized cDNA for human SIRT1 was custom-synthesized at DNA2.0 (Menlo Park, CA) and cloned into a modified pET vector by using standard molecular biology techniques to generate a full-length human SIRT1 construct (amino acids 2–747) with an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site. SIRT1 expression was accomplished in BL21gold (DE3) cells with induction at an A600 nm of 0.9 with a final concentration of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 50 μm for 16–20 h at 15 °C. SIRT1 was purified using a Ni2+ chelating column followed by size exclusion and anion exchange chromatography as described previously (26.Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S. Carney D.P. Smith J.J. Gagne D.J. Jin L. Boss O. Perni R.B. Vu C.B. Bemis J.E. Xie R. Disch J.S. Ng P.Y. Nunes J.J. Lynch A.V. Yang H. Galonek H. Israelian K. Choy W. Iffland A. Lavu S. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Olefsky J.M. Jirousek M.R. Elliott P.J. Westphal C.H. Nature. 2007; 450: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). This procedure typically generated SIRT1 with ∼90% purity based on SDS-PAGE visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Typically 3–5 mg of purified SIRT1 was obtained per liter of culture. The full-length p53 cDNA was cloned into the baculovirus vector pFastBac (Invitrogen) with a His6 tag at the N terminus, and p53 was expressed in Sf9 cells as described (30.Sun X.Z. Nguyen J. Momand J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 234: 17-28PubMed Google Scholar). Sf9 cells expressing p53 from 2 liters of culture were lysed using a microfluidizer, and the resulting lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant containing the soluble p53 fraction was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare) followed by a Q Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare). Purified p53 was acetylated by p300 as described (31.Wang Y.H. Tsay Y.G. Tan B.C. Lo W.Y. Lee S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25568-25576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The acetylation reaction mixture (32 ml) contained 2.5 mg of purified p53, 38 μg of p300 acetylase (FLAG-tagged recombinant enzyme, Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 μm acetyl-CoA, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The reaction was incubated at 22 °C for 16 h. At the end of the reaction, p300 was removed by passing through an anti-FLAG M2 agarose column (Sigma-Aldrich), and the acetylated p53 (Ac-Lys382-p53) was dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. The final Ac-Lys382-p53 was confirmed to contain ∼30–70% acetylation at the Lys-382 residue by tryptic digest followed by LC-MS analysis. The purified and acetylated p53 (Ac-Lys382-p53) protein had purity greater than 98% based on SDS-PAGE visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Typically 6 mg of purified Ac-Lys382-p53 was obtained per liter of culture. The SIRT1 reaction (100 μl) was carried out with 1 μm TAMRA-p53 peptide ((biotin-PEG3)-Ser-Thr-Ser-Ser-His-Ser-(Ac-Lys)-Nle-Ser-Thr-Glu-Gly-Cys(tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide)-Glu-Glu-NH2) (Nle stands for norleucine) (TAMRA Peptide 1 in supplemental Table S1) under the following standard SIRT1 reaction conditions: 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 150 μm NAD+, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 2% DMSO. Reactions were carried out with 5 nm SIRT1 at room temperature for 30 min, yielding ∼5% conversion of TAMRA-p53 peptide to product, allowing for the accurate measurement of ∼20-fold activation. For EC1.5 determination, resveratrol concentrations were varied at 0.01–600 μm, SRT2183 and SRT1460 were at 0.003–200 μm, and SRT1720 was at 0.005–200 μm. The reaction was quenched with trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 2%, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and then transferred to glass HPLC vials. The HPLC separation of the acetylated TAMRA-p53 peptide substrate and deacetylated peptide product peaks was achieved using a Vydac C18, 5 μm, 50 × 4.6-mm (218TP5405) column with accompanying guard. Mobile phase A was 100% H2O + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, whereas mobile phase B was 100% CH3CN + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The following gradient program was used: 0–35% over 15 min followed by rapid ramp up to 100% B to wash and then 100% A to re-equilibrate the column. Flow rate was kept constant at 1.0 ml/min, column temperature was set at 25 °C, and UV detection was set at 220 nm. The retention times of the deacetylated peptide and acetylated TAMRA-p53 peptide were ∼9.1 and ∼9.3 min, respectively. The percentage of conversion was determined by dividing the peak area of the product over the sum of the peak areas of both substrate and product peptides. This value was periodically reevaluated by comparing with a deacetylated peptide standard curve. The average rate of conversion of SIRT1 samples run in the absence of compound was compared with those in the presence of compound to establish the percentage of activation value. GraphPad Prism was used to analyze the data and calculate EC1.5 values. The SIRT1 reaction was carried out under the SIRT1 standard reaction conditions as described above with 1 μm native p53 peptide (Ac-Lys-Lys-Gly-Gln-Ser-Thr-Ser-Arg-His-Lys-(Ac-Lys)-Leu-Met-Phe-Lys-Thr-Glu-Gly-NH2) (Native Peptide 3 in supplemental Table S1) and 2.5 nm SIRT1 at room temperature for 30 min, yielding ∼10% conversion of substrate to product, allowing for the accurate measurement of ∼10-fold activation. Reactions were quenched and processed the same as with the TAMRA-p53 peptide. The separation of acetylated peptide substrate and deacetylated peptide product peaks was achieved using the same column, buffers, and parameters described with the TAMRA-p53 peptide, except that the gradient was altered to: 0–20% over 15 min followed by rapid ramp up to 100% B to wash and then 100% A to re-equilibrate the column. The retention times of the deacetylated and acetylated peptides were ∼10.8 and 11.7 min, respectively. Calculation of the percentage of activation was carried out as described with TAMRA-p53 peptide. The Km values for native-p53 peptide and NAD+ were obtained by fitting the plots of rate versus substrate concentration to the Michaelis-Menten equation using KaleidaGraph. To test the effect of TAMRA on SIRT1 activity by putative activators, the same SIRT1 reactions were run with or without 1, 10, and 100 μm 2,3-TAMRA, each in the presence and absence of compounds. The SIRT1 assay mixture (50 μl) contained 150 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 150 μm NAD+, 1 mm DTT, 0.014% Triton X-100, 3% DMSO, 100 nm Ac-Lys382-p53, and 10 nm SIRT1. The reactions were carried out in 96-well round bottom polypropylene plates (Corning, Lowell, MA). Putative activators were preincubated with SIRT1 at room temperature for 15 min, and the reactions were initiated by NAD+. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of EX-527 to a final concentration of 100 μm. SIRT1 activity was measured by quantifying the levels of Ac-p53 by ELISA. The ELISA was carried out in a black MaxiSorp 96-well plate (Nunc, Rochester, NY) precoated with 0.2 μg of mouse anti-p53 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Nonspecific protein binding was then blocked by block Solution (StartingBlock T20 (PBS), Thermo Scientific) for 30 min. Typically, the SIRT1 reaction mixtures were diluted 10-fold in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μm EX-527. Aliquots (5 μl) of diluted SIRT1 mixture were placed in each well containing 95 μl of the above buffer in the precoated plates and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the plates with wash buffer (PBST 0.1% Tween 20, Sigma-Aldrich), the plates were incubated with 100 μl of either 1:500 acetyl-Lys382-p53 antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) or 1:1000 rabbit anti-p53 (FL-393) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA.) in block solution for 1 h at room temperature. After an additional washing with wash buffer, the plates were incubated with 100 μl of 1:10000 goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in block solution for 1 h at room temperature. After a final washing with wash buffer, 100 μl of SuperSignal ELISA Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific) was added to the plate for development. The plates were read using a Victor2 1420 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) under luminescence setting. The standard curves for ELISA were linear at 1–30 ng of Ac-p53 and total p53. Western blot analyses were conducted using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) with Ac-Lys382-p53, and total p53 was detected on the same blot by using 1:1000 mouse anti-p53 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and 1:1000 rabbit anti-acetyl-Lys382-p53 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibodies used were 1:5000 IR700 goat anti-mouse and 1:5000 IR800 goat anti-rabbit (LI-COR Biosciences). SIRT1 reactions were performed and quenched as described in the ELISA procedure, and 5 μl of the reaction mixture was loaded in each well of SDS-PAGE. Quantification of total p53 levels were used to normalize the reactions for SIRT1 activity. The Km measurements of SIRT1 for p53 were performed using Western and ELISA assays by varying concentrations of p53 from 50 to 850 nm (maximal concentration available). In the first step of the coupled enzyme reaction, the SIRT1 reaction was carried out using standard reaction conditions as described above with 150 nm acetylated acetyl-CoA synthetase 1 (Ac-AceCS1) and 10 nm SIRT1 at room temperature for 30 min, yielding ∼10% conversion of substrate to active AceCS1 product. This allowed for the accurate measurement of ∼10-fold activation. Reactions were quenched by nicotinamide to a final concentration of 5 mm. In the second step of the coupled reaction, saturating concentrations of AceCS1 substrates (2.5 mm ATP, 2 mm NaOAc, and 2 mm coenzyme A) were added. The AceCS1 reactions were incubated for 60 min, quenched by trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 2%, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and then transferred to vials for HPLC analysis. Separation of AMP from ATP and other substrates and products was achieved using a SUPELCOSIL LC-18-T (Sigma, 3 μm, 150 × 4.6 mm) column with accompanying guard. Mobile phase A was 100 mm NH4OAc, pH 5.0, whereas mobile phase B was 80% A + 20% methanol. The following gradient program was used: 0% B for 10 min, 0–100% for 5 min followed by wash, and then 100% A to re-equilibrate the column. Flow rate was kept constant at 1.0 ml/min, column temperature was kept at 25 °C, and UV detection was set at 260 nm. The retention times of ATP and AMP were ∼4 and ∼8 min, respectively. Chromatograms were analyzed, and the peak area was converted to molar concentration of AMP using an AMP standard curve and then converted to the total amount of active enzyme AceCS1 product turned over by SIRT1 using the standard curves mentioned above. The average rate of conversion of SIRT1 samples run in the absence of compound was compared with those in the presence of compound to establish the percentage of activation values. The final concentrations of putative activators tested were 1, 3, 10, and 30 μm. EX-527 was tested at 100 μm. For the measurement of the Km value for Ac-AceCS1 with SIRT1, the SIRT1 reactions were performed by varying concentrations of Ac-AceCS1 at 50–750 nm (maximal concentration available). NMR chemical shift perturbation of the peptide substrates was used to monitor the molecular interaction of SRT1460 with the p53-derived peptide substrates in the absence of SIRT1 enzyme. NMR binding experiments were carried out with peptide substrates, which included the TAMRA-p53 peptide (TAMRA Peptide 1 in supplemental Table S1) and an additional pair of peptides with identical amino acid sequence and differing only in the TAMRA group (Ac-Glu-Glu-Lys-Gly-Gln-Ser-Thr-Ser-Ser-His-Ser-(Ac-Lys)-Nle-Ser-Thr-Glu-Gly-Lys(TAMRA)-Glu-Glu-NH2) and (Ac-Glu-Glu-Lys-Gly-Gln-Ser-Thr-Ser-Ser-His-Ser-(Ac-Lys)-Nle-Ser-Thr-Glu-Gly-Lys-Glu-Glu-NH2) (TAMRA Peptide 2 and Native Peptide 2 in supplemental Table S1). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a 600-MHz Bruker"

In mice, we identified an essential role for histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) dimethylation and the lysine dimethyltransferase G9a in cocaine-induced structural and behavioral plasticity. Repeated cocaine administration reduced global levels of H3K9 dimethylation in the nucleus accumbens. This reduction in histone methylation was mediated through the repression of G9a in this brain region, which was regulated by the cocaine-induced transcription factor DeltaFosB. Using conditional mutagenesis and viral-mediated gene transfer, we found that G9a down-regulation increased the dendritic spine plasticity of nucleus accumbens neurons and enhanced the preference for cocaine, thereby establishing a crucial role for histone methylation in the long-term actions of cocaine."

We use spectroscopic imaging-scanning tunneling microscopy to study the electronic structure of a representative compound CaFe1.94Co0.06As2 in the ""parent"" state from which this superconductivity emerges. Static, unidirectional electronic nanostructures of dimension eight times the inter-iron-atom distance a(Fe-Fe) and aligned along the crystal a axis are observed. In contrast, the delocalized electronic states detectable by quasiparticle interference imaging are dispersive along the b axis only and are consistent with a nematic alpha2 band with an apparent band folding having wave vector q vector congruent with +/-2pi/8a(Fe-Fe) along the a axis. All these effects rotate through 90 degrees at orthorhombic twin boundaries, indicating that they are bulk properties.

The authors show that this effect can be mediated by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells projecting onto thalamic neurons that also receive nociceptive input from the dura mater. The perception of migraine headache, which is mediated by nociceptive signals transmitted from the cranial dura mater to the brain, is uniquely exacerbated by exposure to light. We found that exacerbation of migraine headache by light is prevalent among blind individuals who maintain non–image-forming photoregulation in the face of massive rod/cone degeneration. Using single-unit recording and neural tract tracing in the rat, we identified dura-sensitive neurons in the posterior thalamus whose activity was distinctly modulated by light and whose axons projected extensively across layers I–V of somatosensory, visual and associative cortices. The cell bodies and dendrites of such dura/light-sensitive neurons were apposed by axons originating from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), predominantly from intrinsically photosensitive RGCs, the principle conduit of non–image-forming photoregulation. We propose that photoregulation of migraine headache is exerted by a non–image-forming retinal pathway that modulates the activity of dura-sensitive thalamocortical neurons."

The electrocardiographic PR interval (or PQ interval) reflects atrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction, disturbances of which increase risk of atrial fibrillation. We report a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for PR interval from seven population-based European studies in the CHARGE Consortium: AGES, ARIC, CHS, FHS, KORA, Rotterdam Study, and SardiNIA (N = 28,517). We identified nine loci associated with PR interval at P < 5 × 10−8. At the 3p22.2 locus, we observed two independent associations in voltage-gated sodium channel genes, SCN10A and SCN5A. Six of the loci were near cardiac developmental genes, including CAV1-CAV2, NKX2-5 (CSX1), SOX5, WNT11, MEIS1, and TBX5-TBX3, providing pathophysiologically interesting candidate genes. Five of the loci, SCN5A, SCN10A, NKX2-5, CAV1-CAV2, and SOX5, were also associated with atrial fibrillation (N = 5,741 cases, P < 0.0056). This suggests a role for common variation in ion channel and developmental genes in atrial and atrioventricular conduction as well as in susceptibility to atrial fibrillation."

Growth cone collapse and repulsion by ephrin-A correlates with and requires the downregulation of mTOR signaling. Tuberous sclerosis complex is a disease caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which encode a protein complex that inhibits mTOR kinase signaling by inactivating the Rheb GTPase. Activation of mTOR promotes the formation of benign tumors in various organs and the mechanisms underlying the neurological symptoms of the disease remain largely unknown. We found that Tsc2 haploinsufficiency in mice caused aberrant retinogeniculate projections that suggest defects in EphA receptor–dependent axon guidance. We also found that EphA receptor activation by ephrin-A ligands in neurons led to inhibition of extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity and decreased inhibition of Tsc2 by ERK1/2. Thus, ephrin stimulation inactivates the mTOR pathway by enhancing Tsc2 activity. Furthermore, Tsc2 deficiency and hyperactive Rheb constitutively activated mTOR and inhibited ephrin-induced growth cone collapse. Our results indicate that TSC2-Rheb-mTOR signaling cooperates with the ephrin-Eph receptor system to control axon guidance in the visual system."

https://openalex.org/W2110122595,"The uptake of dietary lipids from the small intestine is a complex process that depends on the activities of specific membrane receptors with yet unknown regulatory mechanisms. Using both mouse models and human cell lines, we show here that intestinal lipid absorption by the scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-BI) is subject to control by retinoid signaling. Retinoic acid via retinoic acid receptors induced expression of the intestinal transcription factor ISX. ISX then repressed the expression of SR-B1 and the carotenoid-15,15′-oxygenase Bcmo1. BCMO1 acts downstream of SR-BI and converts absorbed β,β-carotene to the retinoic acid precursor, retinaldehyde. Using BCMO1-knockout mice, we demonstrated increased intestinal SR-BI expression and systemic β,β-carotene accumulation. SR-BI-dependent accumulation of β,β-carotene was prevented by dietary retinoids that induced ISX expression. Thus, our study revealed a diet-responsive regulatory network that controls β,β-carotene absorption and vitamin A production by negative feedback regulation. The role of SR-BI in the intestinal absorption of other dietary lipids, including cholesterol, fatty acids, and tocopherols, implicates retinoid signaling in the regulation of lipid absorption more generally and has clinical implications for diseases associated with dyslipidemia.—Lobo, G.

Here, we show that an ISC progenitor generates a niche cell via Notch signaling. This niche uses the bone morphogenetic protein 2/4 homolog, decapentaplegic, to allow progenitors to divide in an undifferentiated state and subsequently breaks down and dies, resulting in the specification of ISCs in the adult midgut.

In eukaryotic cells, most proteins are degraded by the 26 S proteasome, which hydrolyzes in an ATP-dependant manner, both ubiquitin-conjugated and certain non-ubiquitinated proteins. In addition to its role in the turnover of damaged or misfolded proteins, the proteasome controls the cell cycle and other processes through the degradation of critical regulatory components and transcription factors (1.Goldberg A.L.

Upon association of ubiquitinated targets with the proteasome, ubiquitin molecules are proteolytically removed for reuse, whereas the unfolded substrates are fed into the 20 S catalytic core, where they are digested into small peptides (4.Hanna J.

Cell. 2001; 7: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Protein ubiquitination is a multistep process orchestrated by the concerted action of three enzymes. The chain reaction begins with a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), which initially adenylates the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin. Next, a thioester bond is formed between the activated C terminus of ubiquitin and a cysteine residue of the E1. A ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) acquires the activated ubiquitin through a trans-thioesterification reaction. Finally, a RING ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) recruits the substrate and guides the transfer of the ubiquitin from the E2 active site cysteine to the substrate. An ϵ-amine of a lysine residue on the substrate (or of additional ubiquitin) attacks the thioester bond between the ubiquitin and the E2 enzyme, forming an isopeptide bond with the C-terminal glycine of the ubiquitin (6.Busch H. Goldknopf I.L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1981; 40: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Rose I.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, when a HECT E3 catalyzes the transfer of the ubiquitin from the E2 to the target, an intermediate complex, of the activated ubiquitin and the active site cysteine of the HECT domain E3, is formed (9.Ardley H.C. Robinson P.A. Essays Biochem. 2005; 41: 15-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several forms of ubiquitination have been identified (10.Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Single or multiple monoubiquitinations have been described where a single or multiple ubiquitin moieties are conjugated to distinct lysine residues on the substrates, but they do not polymerize. These forms of ubiquitination were implicated in diverse cellular pathways, which include endocytosis and sorting of proteins to different cellular compartments (11.Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 12.Haglund K. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 598-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), yet, recently it was also shown to participate in several cases of proteasomal activity, such as the processing of the p105 precursor of the NF-κB transcriptional regulator (13.Kravtsova-Ivantsiv Y. Cohen S. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 496-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, polyubiquitination, which is the covalent assembly of a chain of ubiquitin molecules on one or multiple lysine residues of the substrate, is the most common form of post-translational modification of proteins destined for degradation (14.Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Traditionally, polyubiquitin elongation was thought to proceed as a sequential reaction by the addition of ubiquitin molecules, one at a time, in a cyclic manner, first to a lysine residue on the target protein and from then on to a lysine residue on the distal end of the growing ubiquitin chain. However, in view of recent findings, several alternative mechanisms have been proposed (see Ref. 15.Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2006; 124: 27-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar for a review). Li et al. (16.Li W. Tu D. Brunger A.T. Ye Y. Nature. 2007; 446: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) demonstrated, in vitro, a mode of action in which polyubiquitin is initially assembled on the active site cysteine of an E2 (E2G2), presumably by the action of additional E2 molecules. Once polyubiquitin is constructed, a RING E3 enzyme (gp78) catalyzes the transfer of the polyubiquitin, as a module, to a lysine residue of the target substrate (the C terminus of HERP, a known substrate of these E2/E3 enzymes). However, it is unclear whether en block transfer of polyubiquitin also occurs in vivo. In a related study, Ravid and Hochstrasser (17.Ravid T. Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) proposed that the active site polyubiquitination of Ubc7 (the yeast ortholog of E2G2) is recognized by the proteasome and may serve as a degradation signal in an autoregulation feedback loop. Because ubiquitin harbors seven lysine residues (Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48, and Lys63), in principle, chains of polyubiquitin can be formed via a bond between the C-terminal glycine of one ubiquitin molecule and an ϵ-amine of any of the seven lysine residues of another ubiquitin. Accordingly, seven different topologies of polyubiquitin can be generated (excluding mixed topologies) (18.Ben-Saadon R. Zaaroor D. Ziv T. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).

Lys6 was also implicated in DNA repair, whereas Lys29 may function in proteasome degradation (21.Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol.

To systematically study the mode of action of the E2 family of enzymes, we cloned, expressed, and purified all of the annotated human E2 enzymes. As a control, we expressed the well documented yeast Ubc13-UEV1a and the Ubc5 family members (Ubc5A, Ubc5B, and Ubc5C). Initially, we monitored the ability of the various purified E2 enzymes to function in vitro in autoubiquitination reactions and then corroborated our findings by characterizing substrate ubiquitination by these E2s. We determined by mass spectrometry the lysine specificity in ubiquitin-conjugates generated by the different E2 and the site of ubiquitination. In conjunction, we preformed polyubiquitination reactions in the presence of a gallery of single lysine or arginine ubiquitin derivatives (20.Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This rigorous analysis gave rise to the realization that the E2 enzymes may have a role in selecting the target's lysine. The complete coding sequence of the annotated human E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes were subcloned from a human cDNA library by PCR. The amplified genes were inserted into the bacterial expression vector pET22 in frame to a C-terminal His6 tag. The desired plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli (BL-21 DE3). The bacteria were grown overnight in 50 ml of LB medium complemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. This starter served to inoculate 2 liters of culture that were grown until an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm was reached. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm final concentration) and further growth for 3 h. The bacteria were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm immidazole) and lysed by sonication. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was loaded on a homemade Ni2+-NTA 3The abbreviations used are: NTAnitrilotriacetic acidHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyDTTdithiothreitolRFPred fluorescent proteinUbubiquitinTEVtobacco etch virus. column. Following absorption, the column was washed with buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 1% Tween 20) and buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted with 0.5 m immidazole in phosphate-buffered saline. The pure protein was dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline and stored at −80 °C. nitrilotriacetic acid high pressure liquid chromatography dithiothreitol red fluorescent protein ubiquitin tobacco etch virus. The human wild type ubiquitin was cloned into pET22 and used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. Initially, we substituted all seven lysine residues of ubiquitin by arginines (0K ubiquitin). We then added back each of the seven lysines to its original position, one at a time (denoted as Kx where the x represents for the position of the single lysine added) (20.Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Single arginine ubiquitin mutants were generated by substituting each lysine of the wild type ubiquitin (one at a time) to arginine using site-directed mutagenesis (denoted as Rx where the x represents the position of the single arginine substituted). All single arginine ubiquitin mutants and wild type ubiquitin were transformed into E. coli BL-21 DE3, grown and induced as described under “Plasmid Constriction.” The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), and lysed by sonication. Following centrifugation (16,000 × g), the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 100 mm acetic acid calibrated by NaOH to pH 5. The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was fractionated on Mono-S anion exchange column using HPLC. The ubiquitin was eluted by a salt gradient at about 350 mm NaCl. The relevant fractions were collected and concentrated on a nitrogen-based ultrafiltration device using a 1-kDa cut-off membrane. The sample was then fractionated on an S-30 gel filtration column using 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl. The relevant fractions were collected, concentrated again by a 1 kDa cut-off ultrafiltration device, and stored at −80 °C. Following induction, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 6 m guanidine HCl in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and lysed by sonication. The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was passed through a 30 kDa cut-off nitrogen-based ultrafiltration device. The flow-through was further concentrated using a 1 kDa cut-off and fractionated on an S-30 gel filtration column using HPLC as described above. The relevant fractions were collected, concentrated by a 1 kDa cut-off nitrogen-based ultrafiltration device, and stored at −80 °C. In vitro polyubiquitination reactions contained a 30 nm concentration of the human recombinant E1 (Boston Biochem), 0.5 μm indicated E2 enzyme, and 10 μm wild type ubiquitin or one of the desired purified single lysine/arginine mutants. The polymerization reactions were carried out in 50 μl of buffer C (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm DTT, 10 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 μg/ml creatine kinase; final concentrations in the reaction mixtures). The reaction was prepared on ice and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. For analysis, the samples were boiled with sample buffer, separated on an SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and Western blotted with the indicated antibody. In vitro polyubiquitination reactions were performed as described above. Ni2+-NTA beads were prewashed in buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) and then added to the reaction mixture. Absorption to the beads was performed at 4 °C on a rotating platform (950 rpm) for 2 h. The beads were sedimented by centrifugation and washed twice with buffer D, twice with buffer B, and two additional times with buffer D. One-half of the beads were boiled in sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT, and the other half were boiled in sample buffer without DTT. Corresponding pairs of reduced and non-reduced samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by anti-His and anti-ubiquitin antibodies. His-RFP derivatives (RFP-Ub, RFP, and RFP-Ub-GW) were conjugated to Ni2+-NTA beads to saturation. The RFP-conjugated beads were washed twice with buffer D, twice with buffer B, and two more times with buffer D. 15 μl of saturated beads were used for each polyubiquitination reaction in the presence of wild type ubiquitin as described above. The reactions were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C on a rotating platform (950 rpm). RFP derivatives were separated from the bulk solution by centrifugation and washed twice with buffer D, twice with buffer B, and two times with buffer D. The beads were resuspended and boiled in sample buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot with anti-RFP (MBL). Polyubiquitinated RFP-Ub bound to Ni2+-NTA beads (prepared as described above) was washed twice with TEV reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm DTT). Each reaction was supplemented with 15 μg of TEV protease and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. The beads were then separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation, washed twice with 50 mm Tris, pH 8, boiled in sample buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot with anti-RFP (MBL). Large scale polyubiquitination reactions were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Imperial Blue (Pierce). Certain regions and discrete bands were excised from the gel, reduced (10 mm DTT), modified with 40 mm iodoacetamide, and treated with trypsin or chymotrypsin (modified trypsin; Promega) at a 1:100 enzyme/substrate ratio. The resulting tryptic peptides were resolved by reversed phase chromatography on 0.075 × 200-mm fused silica capillaries (J&W) packed with Reprosil reversed phase material (Dr. Maisch GmbH). The peptides were eluted with linear (over 50 min) gradients of 5–45% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and the tightly bound peptides were collected by a 15-min wash by 95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water. All through the run, the flow rate was 0.25 μl/min. Mass spectrometry was performed by an ion trap mass spectrometer (Orbitrap, Thermo) in a positive mode using repetitively full MS scan followed by collision-induced dissociation of the seven most dominant ions selected from the first MS scan. The mass spectrometry data were analyzed using the Sequest 3.31 software (J. Eng and J. Yates, University of Washington and Finnigan (San Jose, CA)) searching against the human part of the NR-NCBI data base. Identification thresholds of an Xcorr value above 2.0 for doubly charged peptides and 2.5 for triply charged peptides were employed. In addition, the identification of the ubiquitinated peptides was assessed visually by a trained operator. Ubiquitination was identified as a mass addition of 114 Da to the relevant peptide (the GG from the C terminus of ubiquitin attached to a lysine residue). About 0.05 μg (∼50 nm) of each of the purified E2 enzymes, incubated in 50 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, complemented with a 0.05 μm final concentration of cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (Pierce) was added to each sample. The samples were left shaking for 1 h at room temperature. The reactions were quenched with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The samples were then divided into two portions. Half of the reaction mixture was boiled with sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT, whereas the second portion was added boiled in sample buffer without reducing agent. The sample pairs were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blot using α-His antibody. Following cross-linking (see above) the dimerization reactions were boiled in sample buffer without DTT, separated on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then washed with ubiquitination buffer (buffer C) three times. E1 (250 nm) and wild type ubiquitin (100 μm) were added, and the membranes were incubated for an additional 1 h at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by extensive washing with TBST, blocked with 5% milk, and analyzed by Western blot with anti-ubiquitin. The human E2 family enzymes were cloned and expressed in bacteria genetically fused to a His6 tag to aid in purification and detection (supplemental Fig. S1A and Table S1). Initially, we optimized an in vitro self-ubiquitination reaction for E2 enzymes that possess an active site cysteine within the Ubc domain (the conserved catalytic motif of the E2 family). All E2 enzymes tested catalyzed polyubiquitin chain formation in the absence of an E3 and a substrate (supplemental Fig. S1B). As expected, E2M, E2F, and E2I, which are E2 enzymes of ubiquitin-like proteins, did not form ubiquitin conjugates in vitro. We excluded the possibility that polyubiquitin was assembled on the E2 enzymes by an E2-independent action of the E1 enzyme in control reactions using the naturally occurring active site cysteine mutant E2s (e.g. FTS and UEV1/2). Next, we determined if free polyubiquitin chains accumulated in the reaction mixture or whether the detected ubiquitin conjugates were linked to the E2 enzymes themselves, either to the active site cysteine or to lysine residues. For this purpose, following the polyubiquitination reaction, the E2 enzymes were captured onto Ni2+-NTA beads. Western blot analysis of the unbound material by an anti-ubiquitin antibody indicated that almost all of the ubiquitin polymers were confined to the beads (data not shown). In parallel, half of the washed beads were boiled in sample buffer containing DTT (100 mm), whereas the second part was boiled in sample buffer without DTT. The boiled pairs of mixtures corresponding to all of the examined E2 enzymes were then separated on SDS-PAGE, and the E2 species were detected by anti-His tag antibody. Polyubiquitin moiety, linked to the active site cysteine, should detach from the E2 upon boiling in the DTT-containing sample buffer. In contrast, polyubiquitin linked to a lysine side chain should be unaffected by the DTT. In the case of E2A, Ubc5A, Ubc5B, Ubc5C, E2D1, E2D2, E2D3, E2E1, E2G1, E2G2, E2J2, E2L3, E2R1, and E2R2 (group 1), the DTT in the sample buffer liberated most of the polyubiquitin from these E2 enzymes, and the high molecular weight species of E2s were lost (Fig. 1A). The size distribution profiles of E2B, E2C, E2D4, E2E2, E2E3, E2H, E2L6, E2N-E2V1, E2N-E2V2, E2Q2, E2S, E2T, E2W, E2-25K, and the yeast Ubc13-UEV1a (group 2) were unaffected or partially affected by the presence of DTT, suggesting that polyubiquitin moieties in these reactions were mostly bound to lysine residues of the E2 enzymes or both to the active site cysteine and lysine residues (Fig. 1B). These findings were supported by mass spectrometry analyses, which detected ubiquitin-modified lysine residues on most DTT-insensitive ubiquitinated E2s and did not identify such residues when the DTT-sensitive ubiquitinated E2s were analyzed (see below; see Table 1). An example of a complete gallery of the peptides detected by mass spectrometry following a ubiquitination reaction is presented in supplemental Table S2.TABLE 1Summary of human E2 enzyme activityE2MS (supplemental Fig. S3 and Table S2)DTT sensitivity (Fig. 1)Lysine specificityOrigin of analyzed MS samples (supplemental Fig. S3)Ubiquitination on RFP (substrate)Self-ubiquitination on lysineUbiquitination on active site cysteineSelf-ubiquitination on lysineSingle lysine/arginine (Fig. 2 and supplemental Figs.

Accordingly, one possible explanation for non-active site ubiquitination seen in group 2 (Fig. 1B) is that it might result from a subsequent slower, nonspecific transfer of the polyubiquitin from the active site cysteine to a neighboring lysine on the E2. If true, such a nonspecific transfer is anticipated to be significantly enhanced by the long incubation time used here (4 h). To exclude this possibility, we performed representative ubiquitination reactions (group 2) with a shorter time scale (20 min). Although following shorter incubation periods, lower amounts of ubiquitination species were detected, the type and character of the ubiquitination did not change (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, group 2 capacity to promote autoubiquitination on lysine residues appears to be a genuine function of these E2s, at least in vitro. Global in vivo analysis of the specific lysine residues engaged in polyubiquitination indicated that all seven lysine residues of ubiquitin participate in ubiquitin polymerization (23.Peng J.

However, it is unclear how the selection of a specific lysine residue transpires in a given polyubiquitination reaction. To explore whether the E2 directs the type of polyubiquitination, we analyzed the conjugates that were generated by each E2 enzyme by mass spectrometry. Briefly, following in vitro scaled-up self-polyubiquitination reactions in the presence of wild type ubiquitin, the reaction mixtures were separated on SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained (Imperial, Pierce). Regions or specific bands were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis (supplemental Fig. S3 and Table 1). To complement our mass spectrometry analysis, we also performed similar polyubiquitination reactions in the presence of a panel of single lysine and single arginine variants of ubiquitin (20.Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of these reactions with an anti-ubiquitin antibody indicated that all seven lysine residues of ubiquitin could serve in ubiquitin-ubiquitin conjugation (Table 1). As expected, different E2 enzymes could only utilize a subset of the single lysine/arginine derivatives complementary with the specific lysine preference of the E2 enzyme. For example, E2–25K efficiently catalyzes polyubiquitination in the presence of wild type ubiquitin, and the Lys48 single lysine derivative (supplemental Fig. S4A, left), whereas in the single arginine experiments, this E2 enzyme utilized all single arginine derivatives, excluding the Arg48 ubiquitin (supplemental Fig. S4A, right), as reported previously (32.Merkley N. Shaw G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47139-47147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mammalian ortholog of the yeast Ubc13-UEV1a, the E2N-E2V1 complex, promoted polyubiquitination using only the Lys63 single lysine derivative (supplemental Fig. S4B, left) as described before (33.Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 120-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Consequently, it catalyzed polyubiquitination in the presence of all the single arginine derivatives, except Arg63 (supplemental Fig. S4B, right). E2C (UbcH10) generated polyubiquitin chains via Lys11 and Lys48 single lysine ubiquitin (Fig. 2A, left) and all single argin"

Esterified HETE levels generated in response to thrombin were 5.85 +/- 1.42 (PE) or 18.35 +/- 4.61 (PC), whereas free was 65.5 +/- 17.6 ng/4 x 10(7) cells (n = 5 separate donors, mean +/- S.E.). Their generation was stimulated by triggering protease-activated receptors-1 and -4 and signaling via Ca(2+) mobilization secretory phospholipase A2, platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase, src tyrosine kinases, and protein kinase C. Stable isotope labeling showed that they form predominantly by esterification that occurs on the same time scale as free acid generation. Unlike free 12S-HETE that is secreted, esterified HETEs remain cell-associated, with HETE-PEs migrating to the outside of the plasma membrane. 12-Lipoxygenase inhibition attenuated externalization of native PE and phosphatidylserine and HETE-PEs. Platelets from a patient with the bleeding disorder, Scott syndrome, did not externalize HETE-PEs, and liposomes supplemented with HETE-PC dose-dependently enhanced tissue factor-dependent thrombin generation in vitro. This suggests a role for these novel lipids in promoting coagulation. Thus, oxidized phospholipids form by receptor/agonist mechanisms, not merely as an undesirable consequence of vascular and inflammatory disease."

In the current work, we examined other possible signaling pathways that may also contribute to APAP hepatotoxicity.

The silencing of GSK-3β, but not Akt-2 (protein kinase B) or glycogen synthase kinase-3α (GSK-3α), using antisense significantly protected mice from APAP-induced liver injury.

APAP treatment was observed to promote the loss of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL, rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis) in liver. The silencing of GSK-3β decreased the loss of hepatic GCL, and promoted greater GSH recovery in liver following APAP treatment. Silencing JNK1 and -2 also prevented the loss of GCL. APAP treatment also resulted in GSK-3β translocation to mitochondria and the degradation of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) in mitochondrial membranes in liver. The silencing of GSK-3β reduced Mcl-1 degradation caused by APAP treatment. The silencing of GSK-3β also resulted in an inhibition of the early phase (0–2 h), and blunted the late phase (after 4 h) of JNK activation and translocation to mitochondria in liver following APAP treatment.

Med. 2002; 137: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). APAP also remains an important experimental model for drug-induced liver injury, because it is one of the few drugs that cause liver injury in humans, which is reproducible in animals. Consequently, a great deal of our understanding of drug-induced liver injury has come from studying APAP-induced liver injury in animals (2.Kaplowitz N. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Although research on APAP hepatotoxicity spans nearly four decades, studies of the mechanisms underlying APAP hepatotoxicity continue to reveal many new and surprising findings, particularly regarding the importance of signaling pathways in mediating APAP-induced liver injury (3.Han D. Shinohara M. Ybanez M.D. Saberi B. Kaplowitz N. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 196: 267-310Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that APAP-induced liver injury is not a passive process due to overwhelming injury caused by N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinoneimine (NAPQI; the reactive metabolite of APAP) as traditionally believed, but rather an active process involving the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, particularly c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (4.Kaplowitz N. Shinohara M. Liu Z.X. Han D. Gastroenterology. 2008; 135: 1047-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5.Hanawa N. Shinohara M. Saberi B. Gaarde W.A. Han D.

Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 165-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Thus, APAP causes a type of programmed necrosis of hepatocytes. JNK is an important threonine/serine kinase that is activated by various stresses including oxidative stress (7.Zhou Q. Lam P.Y. Han D. Cadenas E. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 325-335PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Han D. Ybanez M.D. Ahmadi S. Yeh K. Kaplowitz N. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2009; 9: 2245-2263Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). When JNK activation is prolonged, it is believed to promote cell death (8.Han D. Ybanez M.D. Ahmadi S. Yeh K. Kaplowitz N. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2009; 9: 2245-2263Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9.Czaja M.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2007; 27: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The small molecule inhibitor of JNK (SP600125) or silencing expression of JNK1 and -2 markedly protected the liver against APAP-induced injury, despite extensive glutathione (GSH) depletion and covalent binding caused by the production of NAPQI (5.Hanawa N.

The JNK signaling pathway activated by APAP appears to target mitochondria to mediate APAP-induced liver injury (3.Han D. Shinohara M. Ybanez M.D. Saberi B. Kaplowitz N. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 196: 267-310Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). APAP hepatotoxicity involves two key processes centered on mitochondria: 1) GSH depletion and covalent binding by NAPQI in mitochondria and 2) the activation of JNK and translocation of JNK to mitochondria (5.Hanawa N. Shinohara M. Saberi B. Gaarde W.A. Han D. Kaplowitz N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13565-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). APAP is metabolized by the CYP2E1 isoform of cytochrome P450 to NAPQI, which depletes GSH and covalently binds to protein thiols, which can inactivate proteins (2.Kaplowitz N. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 10.Hinson J.A. Reid A.B. McCullough S.S. James L.P. Drug Metab. Rev. 2004; 36: 805-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Traditionally, it had been believed that GSH depletion and covalent binding in mitochondria directly lead to inhibition of bioenergetics and trigger mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT; opening of the mitochondria mega-pore) resulting in hepatocyte necrosis and liver injury. However, recent studies by our lab suggest that mitochondrial GSH depletion and covalent binding act only as a first hit, which moderately impairs mitochondria function and leads to release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but inhibition of mitochondrial bioenergetics remains below a critical threshold for hepatocyte viability. However, the first hit (mitochondrial GSH depletion and covalent binding) leads to ROS-mediated activation of MAP kinase and sensitizes mitochondria to a second hit, the translocation of activated JNK to mitochondria, which leads to MPT and marked inhibition of mitochondria function (3.Han D. Shinohara M. Ybanez M.D. Saberi B. Kaplowitz N. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 196: 267-310Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5.Hanawa N. Shinohara M. Saberi B. Gaarde W.A. Han D. Kaplowitz N. J.

Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 165-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). JNK translocates to mitochondria and promotes MPT, cytochrome c release, and causes loss of mitochondrial bioenergetics in various model systems (7.Zhou Q. Lam P.Y. Han D. Cadenas E. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 325-335PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Han D. Ybanez M.D. Ahmadi S. Yeh K. Kaplowitz N. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2009; 9: 2245-2263Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11.Aoki H.

Inhibition of JNK protects against mitochondrial dysfunction and MPT caused by APAP treatment, which prevents hepatocyte death and liver injury (5.Hanawa N. Shinohara M. Saberi B. Gaarde W.A. Han D. Kaplowitz N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13565-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Similarly, deletion of apoptosis signaling-regulated kinase 1 (ASK-1), an important upstream MAP kinase involved in JNK activation has also been shown to prevent APAP-induced liver injury (12.Nakagawa H. Maeda S. Hikiba Y. Ohmae T. Shibata W. Yanai A. Sakamoto K. Ogura K. Noguchi T. Karin M. Ichijo H. Omata M. Gastroenterology. 2008; 135: 1311-1321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which JNK impairs mitochondria function and promotes MPT has not been completely elucidated. The importance of the ROS-activated MAP kinase pathway in APAP hepatotoxicity suggests the possibility that other ROS-activated signaling pathways, both related and unrelated to JNK, may also modulate APAP liver injury. Recently, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) has received a great deal of attention in various pathologies including ischemia reperfusion injury in the heart (13.Miura T. Nishihara M. Miki T. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2009; 109: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14.Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). GSK-3β is an important kinase that was first identified as the major regulator of glycogen synthase, the key enzyme involved in glycogen synthesis. However, like many other kinases, GSK-3β was found to regulate many other processes, including those involving cell death (14.Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 15.Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). In myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, GSK-3β, like JNK, has been shown to translocate to mitochondria and promote MPT, through interactions with voltage-dependent anion channels or through degradation of Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein in mitochondrial membranes (16.Pastorino J.G. Hoek J.B. Shulga N. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10545-10554Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 17.Juhaszova M. Zorov D.B. Kim S.H. Pepe S. Fu Q. Fishbein K.W. Ziman B.D. Wang S. Ytrehus K.

Terashima Y. Shimamoto K. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2007; 43: 564-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, the present studies were designed to determine whether GSK-3β plays a role in APAP hepatotoxicity and to understand its mechanism of action. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting mouse GSK-3α, GSK-3β, Akt2, JNK1, JNK2, and a control oligonucleotide were synthesized as 20 nucleotides, uniform phosphorothioate chimeric oligonucleotides, and purified as previously described (5.Hanawa N. Shinohara M. Saberi B. Gaarde W.A. Han D. Kaplowitz N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13565-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in these studies were chimeric oligonucleotides containing five nuclease-resistant 2′-O-methoxyethylribose-modified phosphorothioate residues on the 5′ and 3′ ends, flanking a 2′-deoxyribonucleotide/phosphorothioate region that supports RNase H-based cleavage of the targeted mRNA. The sequences of the mouse GSK-3β ASO and GSK-3α ASO are 5′-TGGCTTGATATACCACACCA-3′ and 5′-CACACATCGATGGACGAGGT-3′, respectively. The sequence for Akt2 ASO was 5′-ACCTCATTCATGGTGGCAGC-3′ and the control oligonucleotide nonsense sequence was 5′-CCTTCCCTGAAGGTTCCTCC-3′. Anti-phospho-GSK-3β (Tyr-216, Ser-9), GSK-3β, phospho-Akt (Thr-308), Akt, phospho-PKA, PKA, phospho-JNK, JNK, glycogen synthase, phosphoglycogen synthase, actin, and cytochrome oxidase IV (COX IV) antisera were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-GCL was purchased from Novus (Littleton, CO). Anti-Bax and cytochrome c antisera were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) antibody was purchased from either Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA). Male mice (C57BL/6; 6–8 weeks of age) were obtained from Harlan Bioproducts for Science Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). The animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room and allowed to acclimatize for a minimum of 3 days prior to use in experiments. They were maintained on a commercial pellet diet ad libitum. The animals were fasted overnight (no food, but water was available) prior to experiments. All the treatments were administered intraperitoneally. APAP (Sigma) was dissolved in warm PBS (55 °C) and cooled to 37 °C before injection into mice (5.Hanawa N. Shinohara M. Saberi B. Gaarde W.A. Han D. Kaplowitz N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13565-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). For ASO experiments, the animals were given 50 mg/kg in sterile saline (intraperitoneally, 7 injections total, one every other day, an ∼0.3 ml volume injected) prior to APAP administration (6.Gunawan B.K. Liu Z.X. Han D. Hanawa N. Gaarde W.A. Kaplowitz N. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 165-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The last dose of ASO was given 1 day prior to APAP administration. In experiments involving JNK inhibitor (SP600125), JNK inhibitor was dissolved in DMSO (8.3%, v/v) in PBS (1 mg in 125 μl of DMSO diluted with 1375 μl of PBS). JNK inhibitor (10 mg/kg) was injected (intraperitoneally, ∼0.3 ml volume injected) into mice 1 h prior to APAP injection. Blood was obtained after mice were anesthetized at the indicated time periods and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) was measured at the University of Southern California Pathology Reference Laboratory. All animals received care according to methods approved under institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals in research. Primary cultured hepatocytes were isolated as previously described (19.Han D. Hanawa N. Saberi B. Kaplowitz N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The liver was perfused with collagenase and isolated hepatocytes were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% heat-inactive fetal bovine serum, 1 nm bovine insulin, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin, 50 nm hydrocortisone, and 0.15 mg/ml of methionine. 1.2 × 106 cells in 4 ml were plated in individual 60-mm diameter LUX culture dishes coated with 0.03% (w/v) rat tail collagen and cultured in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The viability of the isolated hepatocytes was greater than 90% as judged by trypan blue exclusion. After 3 h, the culture medium was changed to serum-free medium containing 100 units/ml of penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin. At this time, APAP and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) were added to cultured hepatocytes. APAP was dissolved in culture medium and sterile filtered before treatment to cells. BSO, dissolved in PBS, was immediately added after APAP treatment. The GSK-3β inhibitor (SB216763) was dissolved in DMSO and added 2 h before APAP treatment. After 20–24 h of treatment, cells were double-stained with 8 μg/ml of Hoechst 33258 and 1 μm Sytox Green (20.Saberi B. Shinohara M. Ybanez M.D. Hanawa N. Gaarde W.A. Kaplowitz N. Han D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C50-C63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After staining, the culture dishes were observed under an OLYMPUS fluorescent microscope. Quantitation of total and apoptotic cells were performed by counting a minimum of 1000 cells in 10 different fields. Necrotic cells (Sytox Green positive) were determined by counting the same field. APAP, in the presence or absence of BSO, primarily caused necrosis with very little apoptosis being observed (<1%). Mitochondria were isolated from liver of mice by differential centrifugation as previously described (21.Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Livers were excised, washed with 0.25 m sucrose, and homogenized in H-medium (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 2 mm HEPES, 0.05% bovine serum albumin (w/v), plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors). The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, the pellet removed, and the centrifugation process repeated. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 8,500 × g for 15 min. The supernatant (“cytoplasmic fraction,” postmitochondrial S9 fraction) was collected and saved at −80 °C for future analysis. The pellet, which represents the mitochondria fraction, was washed with H-medium and the centrifugation repeated. The mitochondria were resuspended in H-medium before oxygen electrode and Western blot analysis. Respiration was measured in freshly isolated mitochondria by monitoring oxygen consumption polarographically with a Clark-type electrode (Hanstech, UK) in respiration buffer containing 230 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 30 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (21.Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). For isolated mitochondria, 0.75 mg of mitochondria protein was added to 1 ml of respiration buffer and oxygen consumption was monitored in the presence of mitochondrial substrates (21.Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cytoplasmic or mitochondria extracts were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Subsequently, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20. The blots were then incubated with the desired primary and secondary antibodies. Finally, the proteins were detected by Luminol ECL reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Multiple bands in immunoblots of GS and GSK-3β often observed are likely to be the result of multiple phosphorylation sites on these proteins. All gels shown are representative samples from three experiments. Densitometry was performed using Image J program from NIH. GSH was detected using HPLC electrochemical detection as previously described (19.Han D. Hanawa N. Saberi B. Kaplowitz N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Total liver homogenate or mitochondria were mixed with metaphosphoric acid to obtain a 5% metaphosphoric acid solution to prevent GSH autoxidation. Samples were centrifuged (12,000 × g for 5 min) and the supernatant injected into the HPLC. GCL activity was measured spectrophotometrically as previously described (22.Seelig G.F. Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic liver fraction was run twice, once without and once with BSO, a specific irreversible inhibitor of GCL (23.Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The specific GCL activity was calculated from the NADH consumption in samples without BSO minus the samples with BSO. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was produced using the Omniscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) with 10 μm random primers (Applied Biosystems). Two micrograms of total RNA were used for each reverse transcription reaction mixture (20 μl). Real time PCR was carried out using an ABI Prism 7900HT (Applied Biosystems). 10-μl reactions were carried out in a 384-well PCR plate using the following final concentrations: 1 μmol each of forward and reverse primers, 1× SYBR Green PCR master mix (Quanti Tect SYBR Green PCR kit, Qiagen), and 5 ng of cDNA. For each condition triplicates were used to minimize the variation. Cycling conditions were as follows: initial step (50 °C for 2 min), hot activation (95 °C for 10 min), amplification (95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min), repeated 40 times, and quantification with a single fluorescence measurement at the dissociation stage. Data were analyzed using ABI Prism SDS 2.1 software. We used the standard curve method provided by the system software (SDS2.1) for relative quantification following the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Briefly, the resultant mRNA was normalized to its own glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Final results were expressed as n-fold difference in gene expression relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. For C57BL/6 mouse, the primer pair for Gcl-c was 5′-GGGGTGACGAGGTGGAGTA-3′ and 5′-GTTGGGGTTTGTCCTCTCCC-3′), and the primer pair for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was 5′-AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG-3′ and 5′-TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA-3′. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test for unpaired data or analysis of variance for comparison of multiple groups. p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant. To determine whether other signaling pathways besides JNK play an important role in APAP hepatotoxicity, the activation of various signaling pathways following APAP treatment was investigated in liver. Fig. 1A shows that APAP treatment results in increased phosphorylation of both GSK-3β and Akt, but does not affect the protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation status. Phosphorylation of Akt at the site of threonine 308 is generally associated with activation and once activated, Akt can phosphorylate many proteins including GSK-3β on the site of serine 9 (14.Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). GSK-3β is constitutively active in the cytoplasm, but its activity can be enhanced by phosphorylation at tyrosine 216 or inhibited by phosphorylation at the site of serine 9 (15.Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, 24.Eldar-Finkelman H. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Although APAP treatment increased levels of both the active and inhibited forms of GSK-3β, APAP caused an increase in glycogen synthase phosphorylation, an important downstream target of GSK-3β, suggesting APAP treatment leads to an overall increase in GSK-3β activity. Fig. 1B shows the time course of GSK-3β (serine 9) and JNK phosphorylation. Both GSK-3β (serine 9) and JNK phosphorylation occurred within 1 h of APAP treatment; however, GSK-3β phosphorylation appears to peak at 2 h, and begins to decline at 4 h, unlike JNK phosphorylation, which peaked at 4 h. Previous studies have also suggested that GSK-3β, like JNK, once further activated, translocates to mitochondria. APAP treatment resulted in translocation of GSK-3β (both phosphorylated forms and total GSK-3β) to mitochondria, similar to JNK (Fig. 1C). Again, both GSK-3β and JNK translocation to mitochondria started at 1 h. GSK-3β translocation to mitochondria peaked at 2 h, whereas JNK translocation peaked at 4 h. The signaling changes to Akt, JNK, GSK-3β, and glycogen synthase as well as GSK-3β and JNK translocation to mitochondria, all preceded liver injury (ALT increased at ∼6 h) caused by APAP. GSK-3β translocation to mitochondria only occurred at APAP doses that caused liver injury (i.e. >200 mg/kg) and not at doses that do not cause liver injury (i.e. <200 mg/kg). We next examined whether the signaling pathways activated (Akt, GSK-3β) by APAP treatment in vivo were important in mediating hepatotoxicity. In liver, there are three isoforms of Akt (Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3), with Akt2 being an important regulator of insulin signaling (25.Whiteman E.L. Cho H. Birnbaum M.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 444-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). To determine whether Akt2 may be important in APAP-induced liver injury, Akt2 was silenced using antisense. Although Akt levels were significantly reduced in liver, no differences in serum ALT levels occurred with the silencing of Akt2 in vivo following APAP treatment (300 mg/kg) (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, silencing of GSK-3β significantly reduced serum ALT levels compared with control, suggesting that GSK-3β activation is important in mediating liver injury caused by APAP (Fig. 2B). The protection against APAP-induced liver injury was not observed when GSK-3α, the other GSK isoform, was silenced using antisense (Fig. 2C). The lack of protection by silencing GSK-3α confirms that GSK-3β specifically mediates APAP hepatotoxicity. A detailed time course revealed that silencing GSK-3β significantly lowered ALT levels compared with control at all time points examined, up to 48 h (Fig. 3A). This demonstrates that silencing GSK-3β actually prevents, and does not simply delay, APAP-induced liver injury. Liver histological sections showed a significant decrease in necrosis following APAP treatment when GSK-3β was silenced (Fig. 3B), confirming the ALT findings. Several chemical GSK-3β inhibitors (SB216763 and SB415286) were also tested in vivo to determine their protective effects against APAP-induced liver injury. However, problems with solubility requiring large amounts of DMSO, which greatly modulates APAP injury, and ineffectiveness of inhibiting GSK-3β activity precluded the use of these chemical GSK-3β inhibitors in vivo (data not shown). Cultured primary hepatocytes isolated from GSK-3β-silenced mice were also significantly protected from necrosis caused by various doses of APAP (Fig. 4A), supporting the role of GSK-3β in hepatocytes as opposed to nonparenchymal cells. Similarly, pretreatment (2 h) of hepatocytes (both β and α isoforms) with 20 μm SB216763 (an inhibitor specific for GSK-3) (26.Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Roxbee Cox L. Mills D. Brown M.J. Haigh D. Ward R.W. Smith D.G. Murray K.J. Reith A.D. Holder J.C. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), also protected hepatocytes from APAP-induced necrosis (Fig. 4B). Because the GSK-3 inhibitor was dissolved in DMSO, which alters APAP hepatotoxicity (27.Park Y. Smith R.D. Combs A.B. Kehrer J.P. Toxicology. 1988; 52: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), slightly higher levels of APAP were used in experiments involving GSK-3 inhibitor. At very high doses of APAP (>1"
https://openalex.org/W1979237890,"Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) play central roles in insulin signal transduction. While the contribution of class Ia PI3K members has been extensively studied, the role of class II members remains poorly understood. The diverse actions of class II PI3K-C2α have been attributed to its lipid product PI(3)P. By applying pharmacological inhibitors, transient overexpression and small-interfering RNA-based knockdown of PI3K and PKB/Akt isoforms, together with PI-lipid profiling and live-cell confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we now demonstrate that in response to insulin, PI3K-C2α generates PI(3, 4)P2, which allows the selective activation of PKBα/Akt1. Knockdown of PI3K-C2α expression and subsequent reduction of PKBα/Akt1 activity in the pancreatic β-cell impaired glucose-stimulated insulin release, at least in part, due to reduced glucokinase expression and increased AS160 activity. Hence, our results identify signal transduction via PI3K-C2α as a novel pathway whereby insulin activates PKB/Akt and thus discloses PI3K-C2α as a potential drugable target in type 2 diabetes. The high degree of codistribution of PI3K-C2α and PKBα/Akt1 with insulin receptor B type, but not A type, in the same plasma membrane microdomains lends further support to the concept that selectivity in insulin signaling is achieved by the spatial segregation of signaling events.—Leibiger, B., Moede, T., Uhles, S., Barker, C. J., Creveaux, M., Domin, J., Berggren, P.-O., Leibiger, I. B. Insulin-feedback via PI3K-C2α activated PKBα/Akt1 is required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

https://openalex.org/W2050912869,"P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), a member of the ABC superfamily, functions as an ATP-driven multidrug efflux pump. The catalytic cycle of ABC proteins is believed to involve formation of a sandwich dimer in which two ATP molecules are bound at the interface of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). However, such dimers have only been observed in isolated NBD subunits and catalytically arrested mutants, and it is still not understood how ATP hydrolysis is coordinated between the two NBDs. We report for the first time the characterization of an asymmetric state of catalytically active native P-glycoprotein with two bound molecules of adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (ATPgammaS), one of low affinity (K(d) 0.74 mm), and one ""occluded"" nucleotide of 120-fold higher affinity (K(d) 6 microm). ATPgammaS also interacts with P-glycoprotein with high affinity as assessed by inhibition of ATP hydrolysis and protection from covalent labeling of a Walker A Cys residue, whereas other non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues do not. Binding of ATPgammaS (but not ATP) causes Trp residue heterogeneity, as indicated by collisional quenching, suggesting that it may induce conformational asymmetry. Asymmetric ATPgammaS-bound P-glycoprotein does not display reduced binding affinity for drugs, implying that transport is not driven by ATP binding and likely takes place at a later stage of the catalytic cycle. We propose that this asymmetric state with two bound nucleotides represents the next intermediate on the path toward ATP hydrolysis after nucleotide binding, and an alternating sites mode of action is achieved by simultaneous switching of the two active sites between high and low affinity states."
https://openalex.org/W2049265847,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a poorly understood progressive disease characterized by the accumulation of scar tissue in the lung interstitium. A hallmark of the disease is areas of injury to type II alveolar epithelial cells with attendant accumulation of fibroblasts in areas called fibroblastic foci. In an effort to better characterize the lung fibroblast phenotype in IPF patients, we isolated fibroblasts from patients with IPF and looked for activation of signaling proteins, which could help explain the exaggerated fibrogenic response in IPF. We found that IPF fibroblasts constitutively expressed increased basal levels of SPARC, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and active β-catenin compared with control cells. Control of basal PAI-1 expression in IPF fibroblasts was regulated by SPARC-mediated activation of Akt, leading to inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β and activation of β-catenin. Additionally, IPF fibroblasts (but not control fibroblasts) were resistant to plasminogen-induced apoptosis and were sensitized to plasminogen-mediated apoptosis by inhibition of SPARC or β-catenin. These findings uncover a newly discovered regulatory pathway in IPF fibroblasts that is characterized by elevated SPARC, giving rise to activated β-catenin, which regulates expression of downstream genes, such as PAI-1, and confers an apoptosis-resistant phenotype.

Current estimates of disease incidence are 40–50 per 100,000 and ∼125,000 cases in the United States. Most patients are 50–70 years old, but patients with familial IPF tend to present earlier. Patients are usually symptomatic for 6–24 months before diagnosis but often present with advanced fibrotic disease. Despite therapy, IPF has a median survival of 4–5 years (1.Zisman D.A. Keane M.P. Belperio J.A. Strieter R.M. Lynch 3rd, J.P. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 117: 3-44PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the current therapy targeted at IPF is anti-inflammatory. These treatments have yielded few durable responses. Their failure is due in great part to the unique pathogenesis of IPF. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of IPF is evolving, with more recent evidence suggesting a process of alveolar epithelial injury, possibly ongoing, and dysregulated repair, leading to proliferation of myofibroblasts and fibrotic scarring in the lung. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis transforming growth factor-β α-smooth muscle actin extracellular matrix alveolar epithelial cells glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphoinositide 3-kinase plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline quantitative PCR small hairpin RNA acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin fluorescence-activated cell sorter epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Myofibroblasts in IPF are thought to arise, at least in part, from differentiation of fibroblasts in response to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). They are characterized by expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and synthesis of matrix-modifying factors such as collagen and fibronectin. The proliferation of myofibroblasts is a critical step in the generation of fibrotic scarring in IPF (2.Phan S.H. Chest. 2002; 122: 286S-289SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This process is very similar to what occurs during normal wound healing. Myofibroblasts are responsible for pulling on a wound in order for its edges to approximate and close. They also lay down the extracellular matrix (ECM) that is part of the wound scar. Once wound repair is complete, myofibroblasts normally undergo apoptosis, and other cells in the vicinity break down the ECM. In IPF, however, apoptosis of myofibroblasts is impaired, and they maintain an environment that is non-degradative, thereby preserving and extending the ECM. A critical regulator of fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and the genesis of matrix components is isoform 1 of TGF-β, a powerful mitogen that is secreted by type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC), macrophages, platelets, and myofibroblasts themselves in response to injury (3.Kapanci Y. Desmouliere A. Pache J.C. Redard M. Gabbiani G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152: 2163-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). TGF-β regulates multiple signaling pathways that coordinate cellular responses to injury, tissue repair, and fibrosis. Recent studies have elucidated that TGF-β activates Wnt/β-catenin. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway has been shown to organize diverse regulatory pathways during development, cell growth and differentiation, tissue remodeling, and tumorigenesis (4.Cadigan K.M. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 322-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Wnt/β-catenin or canonical Wnt signaling pathway is characterized by the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, which forms a complex with members of the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor-1 family of transcription factors (4.Cadigan K.M. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 322-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Many of these genes are involved in matrix remodeling and fibrogenesis, such as SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine); matrix metalloproteinase-2, -3, and -9; cyclin D1; matrilysin; and fibronectin. In recent studies, TGF-β has been shown to induce rapid nuclear translocation of β-catenin in mesenchymal stem cells in a Smad-3-dependent manner (5.Jian H. Shen X. Liu I. Semenov M. He X. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Also, a recent study showed that TGF-β activates the β-catenin pathway in lung fibroblasts through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) (6.Caraci F. Gili E. Calafiore M. Failla M. La Rosa C. Crimi N. Sortino M.A. Nicoletti F. Copani A. Vancheri C. Pharmacol. Res. 2008; 57: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the lung, a Gata6-Wnt/β-catenin pathway was recently shown to be required for epithelial stem cell development and airway regeneration (7.Zhang Y. Goss A.M. Cohen E.D. Kadzik R. Lepore J.J. Muthukumaraswamy K. Yang J. DeMayo F.J. Whitsett J.A. Parmacek M.S. Morrisey E.E. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 862-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Recent studies also point to a role for the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in pulmonary fibrosis (8.Königshoff M. Balsara N. Pfaff E.M. Kramer M. Chrobak I. Seeger W. Eickelberg O. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Chilosi et al. (9.Chilosi M. Poletti V. Zamò A. Lestani M. Montagna L. Piccoli P. Pedron S. Bertaso M. Scarpa A. Murer B. Cancellieri A. Maestro R. Semenzato G. Doglioni C. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1495-1502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) reported the accumulation of nuclear β-catenin in damaged type II AEC and myofibroblasts in fibroblastic foci in IPF lung but not in other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias such as nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. A more recent study revealed activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in type II AEC from IPF patients, which appeared to play a role in mediating epithelial injury and hyperplasia (8.Königshoff M. Balsara N. Pfaff E.M. Kramer M. Chrobak I. Seeger W. Eickelberg O. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was suggested that activation of Wnt signaling in adjacent lung mesenchyme may prevent the proper differentiation of the alveolar epithelium (10.Ramasamy S.K. Mailleux A.A. Gupte V.V. Mata F. Sala F.G. Veltmaat J.M. Del Moral P.M. De Langhe S. Parsa S. Kelly L.K. Kelly R. Shia W. Keshet E. Minoo P. Warburton D. Bellusci S. Dev. Biol. 2007; 307: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). SPARC, a matricellular protein that regulates tissue repair and wound healing, is a known target of TGF-β (reviewed in Ref. 36.Clark C.J. Sage E.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 104: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is known to accumulate in myofibroblasts in fibroblastic foci in IPF (11.Kuhn C. Mason R.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1759-1769PubMed Google Scholar). It also plays a role in the assembly of fibrillar collagen in the ECM (44.Bradshaw A.D. J. Cell Commun. Signal. 2009; 3: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recently, a study by Nie and Sage (12.Nie J. Sage E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1279-1290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SPARC induces the accumulation and activation of β-catenin in preadipocytes, leading to an enhanced association of β-catenin with T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor and inhibition of adipogenesis. They showed that integrin-linked kinase (ILK), but not Akt, is required for SPARC activation of β-catenin and that LiCl mimics the effects of SPARC. They also revealed that SPARC regulates expression of α5- and α6-integrins through β-catenin. Their laboratory also recently showed that SPARC mediates cell survival through its interaction with β1-integrin and activation of ILK (45.Weaver M.S. Workman G. Sage E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22826-22837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We were interested in identifying genes and signaling pathways in lung fibroblasts from IPF patients that contribute to the fibrogenic phenotype through promoting ECM deposition and/or inhibition of apoptosis. Recently published supporting studies reveal that TGF-β induces protection from serum starvation-mediated apoptosis through the p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways (13.Horowitz J.C. Lee D.Y. Waghray M. Keshamouni V.G. Thomas P.E. Zhang H. Cui Z. Thannickal V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1359-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 14.Kulasekaren P. Scavone C.A. Rogers D.S. Arenberg D.A. Thannickal V.J. Horowitz J.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 42: 484-493Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Also, endothelin-1 and TGF-β appear to independently protect lung fibroblasts from apoptosis via these pathways (13.Horowitz J.C. Lee D.Y. Waghray M. Keshamouni V.G. Thomas P.E. Zhang H. Cui Z. Thannickal V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1359-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 14.Kulasekaren P. Scavone C.A. Rogers D.S. Arenberg D.A. Thannickal V.J. Horowitz J.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 42: 484-493Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The same laboratory also showed that TGF-β-mediated induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) protects lung fibroblasts from plasminogen-induced apoptosis (15.Horowitz J.C. Rogers D.S. Simon R.H. Sisson T.H. Thannickal V.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2008; 38: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Several previous studies show that PAI-1 promotes fibrosis in lung and other tissues and that plasminogen activation is anti-fibrogenic (16.Kortlever R.M. Bernards R. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2697-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17.Liu R.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Additionally, PAI-1 has been shown to impair alveolar epithelial repair through binding to vitronectin, and TGF-β requires PAI-1 for its cytostatic effect on epithelial cells (18.Lazar M.H. Christensen P.J. Du M. Yu B. Subbotina N.M. Hanson K.E. Hansen J.M. White E.S. Simon R.H. Sisson T.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 24308-24313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To further characterize the interplay between these matrix-modifying pathways in IPF fibroblasts, we isolated fibroblasts from IPF patients and used fibroblasts isolated from patients undergoing resection for lung cancer as our control. Like others previously, we observed increased expression of total α-SMA in IPF fibroblast samples versus control fibroblasts, which is consistent with an increase in the number of myofibroblasts in IPF, as has been observed in IPF. However, there was significantly more heterogeneity in the level of total α-SMA expression in IPF fibroblasts versus control fibroblasts. We report, for the first time, that IPF fibroblasts constitutively express significantly more SPARC and nuclear, i.e. active, β-catenin than control fibroblasts. Because the resistance of IPF fibroblasts to normal apoptotic signals may play a role in disease pathogenesis, we looked for targets of SPARC/β-catenin, which may mediate this protection. Because PAI-1 has been shown to mediate apoptotic resistance in lung fibroblasts, we compared the levels of PAI-1 in control fibroblasts versus IPF fibroblasts and found significantly higher basal PAI-1 expression in IPF fibroblasts. Also, IPF fibroblasts were significantly more resistant than control fibroblasts to plasminogen-induced apoptosis. Finally, we show that SPARC mediates activation of β-catenin through activation of Akt, leading to inhibition of GSK-3β. Also, this pathway regulates PAI-1 expression in IPF fibroblasts. These data describe, for the first time, a constitutive signaling pathway regulated by SPARC/β-catenin in IPF fibroblasts that leads to increased basal expression of PAI-1, which mediates resistance to plasminogen-induced apoptosis. This may contribute to both impairment of epithelial repair and fibrosis in IPF. Lung tissue was obtained from patients undergoing surgical biopsy for the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease or lung transplant for IPF, and non-neoplastic tissue was obtained from patients undergoing surgical lung cancer resection. The tissue was minced into small pieces with a scalpel and digested with type I collagenase (1 mg/ml; Invitrogen) and hyaluronidase (125 units/ml; Sigma) at 37 °C with agitation for 18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The dissociated tissues were incubated without shaking for 5 min at room temperature, followed by the separation of cell-enriched supernatant into a new tube. The cell fraction was centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was then resuspended in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Epithelial cells did not, in general, survive more than one passage and were in large part eliminated through trypsinization. Surviving fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Each fibroblast culture was frozen at its earliest available passage and was used for studies for up to five passages. For each experiment, cells were plated in culture vessels in DMEM and cultured until 70–80% confluent, unless indicated otherwise. Cells were subjected to starvation by washing cells twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by the addition of DMEM and 0.1% serum to each well and incubation for an additional 24 h. In the experiments for cell death induced by Glu-plasminogen (American Diagnostica Inc., Stamford, CT), phenol red-free DMEM was used. Western blot analysis and band intensity quantitation were performed as described previously (20.Chang W.T. Kang J.J. Lee K.Y. Wei K. Anderson E. Gotmare S. Ross J.A. Rosen G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2221-2227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An equal amount of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed using primary antibodies for α-SMA (American Research Products, Inc., Belmont, MA); SPARC (Biodesign International, Saco, ME); cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175), phospho-Akt (Ser473), phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9), and GSK-3β (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); active β-catenin (8E7; Millipore, Billerica, MA); total β-catenin (BD Biosciences); PAI-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and α-tubulin (used as a loading control; Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (GE Healthcare). The blot was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) and analyzed using a Kodak Image Station 4000R system (Carestream Health, Rochester, NY). To detect secreted PAI-1, the culture medium was first cleared by centrifugation, and proteins were precipitated in the presence of ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The excess salts were removed by dialysis against lysis buffer used for total lysate preparation, and protein quantitation was performed by the Bradford assay as described above. To suppress endogenous PI3K activity, 10 μm LY293002 or 1 μm wortmannin (Sigma) was used, and dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) was used as a control. Fibroblasts were grown on 2-well chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in complete culture medium until 50–60% confluent. Cells were subjected to starvation (0.1% serum) for 48 h. After washing with 1× PBS, cells were treated with 100% methanol at −20 °C for 5 min. Cells were then blocked in 1× PBS and 3% normal goat serum (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with anti-active β-catenin at 1:100 dilution in blocking solution for 16 h at 4 °C. The target proteins were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Calbiochem), and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used for nuclear counterstaining. Fluorescent images were taken and processed using a Labophot-2 microscope equipped with an episcopic fluorescence attachment (EFD-3; Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY). For the quantitation of nuclear localized β-catenin, at least total 100 cells were randomly selected from five fields of each stained sample to obtain the percentage of nuclear localization of β-catenin. To isolate stable cell nuclei from fibroblasts for the staining of intranuclear β-catenin and for analyzing on a flow cytometer, a protocol disrupting cell membrane by detergent (Triton X-100) and maintaining nuclear membrane integrity by magnesium was adopted from the Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory at the NCI ETI Branch (home.ncifcrf.gov/ccr/flowcore/nuclei.pdf). Briefly, cells were collected by gentle scraping and washed twice with cold PBS. Cells were then resuspended in cold nuclear isolation buffer (320 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) and allowed to incubate on ice for 10 min. Nuclear yield and integrity were confirmed by microscopic examination with trypan blue staining. We routinely observed >98% nuclear isolation efficiency (data not shown). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g and washed twice with nuclear wash buffer (320 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Isolated nuclei were then incubated overnight with anti-β-catenin antibody (5 μg/ml) or normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by a 1-h incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (2 μg/ml) in nuclear wash buffer plus 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide. All steps described above were done at 4 °C. After extensive washing, nuclei were resuspended in 250 μl of nuclear wash buffer before flow cytometry analysis. Flow cytometry was performed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer system (Accuri Cytometers, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) using 488 nm excitation and standard fluorescein isothiocyanate emission optics with 10,000 events from each sample, and analysis was performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). RNA was extracted from fibroblasts using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and cDNA converted from 5 μg of total RNA was obtained using a SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR kit (Invitrogen). To control for genomic DNA contamination, additional RNA samples were processed without reverse transcriptase. The reverse transcription product equivalent to 25 ng of total RNA was then added to a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using a Dynamo SYBR Green qPCR kit (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following primers were used: human PAI-1, 5′-TGGAACAAGGATGAGATCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGTTGAAGTAGAGGGCATT-3′ (antisense); human α-SMA, 5′-CTGTTCCAGCCATCCTTCAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGTGATCTCCTTCTGCATT-3′ (antisense); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GACCCCTTCATTGACCTCAAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGA-3′ (antisense). The annealing and amplification temperature was 60 °C. Real-time qPCR was performed in strip tubes using a StepOne PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specificity of amplified products was suggested by a melting curve resulting in only one peak. This was further confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products visualized under ethidium bromide/UV illumination. Target amplifications were compared with the reference amplifications (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) in the same experiment for each reverse transcription product tested. All reactions were carried out in duplicate, and the threshold cycle (Ct) values were determined by automated threshold analysis with the StepOne software. The final results are presented as relative -fold change in target gene expression compared with the reference based on the comparative or ΔΔCt method. The efficiency of each primer pair was determined by the qPCR procedure from standard dilutions of cDNA (equivalent to 10 pg to 10 ng of total RNA in the reverse transcription reaction). To assess the effect of an inhibitor of the TGF-β1 receptor/ALK5 in suppressing PAI-1 expression, 10 μm SB431542 (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO) was added 1 h prior to the addition of human recombinant TGF-β1 at 2 ng/ml overnight. To determine the concentration of PAI-1 in the culture medium of human lung fibroblasts, cells were plated in a 24-well plate at 5 × 105 cells/well overnight in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum. After serum deprivation for 24 h, the culture medium was collected and spun at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove any cell debris. The PAI-1 concentration of each supernatant was determined using a Quantikine human serpin E1/PAI-1 immunoassay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The active TGF-β concentration in the cultured fibroblasts was assayed using the co-culture method with mink lung epithelial cells transfected with a truncated PAI-1 promoter fused to a firefly luciferase gene (referred to as MLEC-PAI-1-Lux cells; a kind gift from Dr. George Yang, Stanford University) (21.Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were seeded in 96-well plates at 2.5 × 104 cells/well in triplicates, along with MLEC-PAI-1-Lux cells at 1.5 × 104 cells/well in low serum (1%) medium. The use of 1% serum instead of starvation medium with 0.1% serum was needed to support survival of the MLEC-PAI-1-Lux cells. A standard curve of active TGF-β1 was generated in MLEC-PAI-1-Lux cells with serial dilutions of human recombinant TGF-β1 (0–10 ng/ml; Sigma). After incubation for 24 h, the viability of cells was checked microscopically before washing twice with 1× PBS. Cells were then lysed in 1× passive lysis buffer at 50 μl/well (luciferase assay kit, Promega, Madison, WI) and incubated with agitation at room temperature for 20 min. 10 μl of cell lysate was analyzed for luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells from fibroblast-only wells were used for the cell count. The mean values of luciferase activity from triplicates were then converted into concentrations of TGF-β in picograms/number of cells using a standard curve obtained with human recombinant TGF-β1, normalized with cell numbers. The concentration of total TGF-β1 in the culture medium for corresponding fibroblasts was determined using a Quantikine human TGF-β1 immunoassay kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We constructed a lentivirus-driven β- catenin small hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression plasmid from the pLKO.1 vector (22.Moffat J. Grueneberg D.A. Yang X. Kim S.Y. Kloepfer A.M. Hinkle G. Piqani B.

The efficiency of shRNA knockdown of endogenous β-catenin or SPARC was assessed by Western blot analysis. Cell viability was determined by an alamarBlue assay. Briefly, primary fibroblasts were seeded overnight in 96-well plates in triplicates and then subjected to serum starvation (0.1% serum) for 24 h. Cells were left untreated or were treated with Glu-plasminogen at the indicated concentrations for 48 h. alamarBlue (resazurin from Sigma) was added to each well at 1.25 μg/ml for 2–4 h, and the fluorometric assay was done with excitation wavelength at 560 nm and emission wavelength at 590 nm with a fluorescence plate reader (FLUOstar Omega, BMG Labtech, Durham, NC). For each assay, data were collected from triplicates and analyzed and are represented as the percentage of viable cells relative to the untreated sample. Caspase-3 protease activity in Glu-plasminogen-treated lung fibroblasts was determined by the fluorometric reaction using acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (DEVD-AFC; R&D Systems) as substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, following the induction of cell death by Glu-plasminogen for 24 h, cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in lysis buffer on ice for 10 min. 50 μl of cell lysate (from 2 × 106 cells) was mixed with 50 μl of 2× reaction buffer and 10 mm dithiothreitol and 5 μl of 1 mm DEVD-AFC in a 96-well plate. After incubation at 37 °C for 90 min, the release of free AFC cleaved by active caspase-3 proteases was determined using the fluorescence microplate reader with excitation at 400 nm and emission at 505 nm. The level of caspase-3 enzymatic activity in the cell lysate is directly proportional to the fluorescent signal of cleaved AFC. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. One-way analysis of variance and Student's t test were used for intergroup comparison. A probability level of 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered significant. To further elucidate the phenotype of fibroblasts originating from IPF lung, we isolated fibroblasts from IPF patients and compared them with control fibroblasts, which were isolated from tissue taken at the time of lung cancer resection surgery and remote from the cancer. As others have reported previously, we found an increase in total α-SMA in IPF fibroblasts versus control fibroblasts (Fig. 1). This agrees with the observation that increased numbers of myofibroblasts are present in IPF, but it is noteworthy that they also retain this phenotypic identity in culture (23.Larsson O. Diebold D. Fan D. Peterson M. Nho R.S. Bitterman P.B. Henke C.A. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). There was also greater heterogeneity in the expression of α-SMA in IPF fibroblasts compared with control fibroblasts, which likely reflects varying numbers of myofibroblas"

The N-dealkylation of DMN had a high intrinsic kinetic deuterium isotope effect ((D)k(app) approximately 10), which was highly expressed in a variety of competitive and non-competitive experiments. The (D)k(app) for DEN was approximately 3 and not expressed in non-competitive experiments. DMN and DEN were also oxidized to HCO(2)H and CH(3)CO(2)H, respectively. In neither case was a lag observed, which was unexpected considering the k(cat) and K(m) parameters measured for oxidation of DMN and DEN to the aldehydes and for oxidation of the aldehydes to the carboxylic acids. Spectral analysis did not indicate strong affinity of the aldehydes for P450 2A6, but pulse-chase experiments showed only limited exchange with added (unlabeled) aldehydes in the oxidations of DMN and DEN to carboxylic acids. Substoichiometric kinetic bursts were observed in the pre-steady-state oxidations of DMN and DEN to aldehydes. A minimal kinetic model was developed that was consistent with all of the observed phenomena and involves a conformational change of P450 2A6 following substrate binding, equilibrium of the P450-substrate complex with a non-productive form, and oxidation of the aldehydes to carboxylic acids in a process that avoids relaxation of the conformation following the first oxidation (i.e. of DMN or DEN to an aldehyde)."
https://openalex.org/W2119495025,"Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mice have a mutation within the gene encoding cytosolic carboxypeptidase 1 (CCP1/Nna1), which has homology to metallocarboxypeptidases. To assess the function of CCP1/Nna1, quantitative proteomics and peptidomics approaches were used to compare proteins and peptides in mutant and wild-type mice. Hundreds of peptides derived from cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins are greatly elevated in pcd mouse hypothalamus, amygdala, cortex, prefrontal cortex, and striatum. However, the major proteins detected on 2-D gel electrophoresis were present in mutant and wild-type mouse cortex and hypothalamus at comparable levels, and proteasome activity is normal in these brain regions of pcd mice, suggesting that the increase in cellular peptide levels in the pcd mice is due to reduced degradation of the peptides downstream of the proteasome. Both nondegenerating and degenerating regions of pcd mouse brain, but not wild-type mouse brain, show elevated autophagy, which can be triggered by a decrease in amino acid levels. Taken together with previous studies on CCP1/Nna1, these data suggest that CCP1/Nna1 plays a role in protein turnover by cleaving proteasome-generated peptides into amino acids and that decreased peptide turnover in the pcd mice leads to cell death."

However, whether p53 can both activate and suppress the same gene is unclear. To address this question, concentration-dependent p53 effect on the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene was investigated. By transfecting p53 in PC-3 cells, we demonstrate that low concentrations of p53 increase while high concentrations suppress MnSOD expression. The physiological relevance of this effect was determined in vitro and in vivo using combined UVB-mediated activation and small interference RNA-mediated suppression of p53. Results were consistent with the bi-directional effect of p53 on MnSOD expression. MnSOD-promoter/enhancer analysis demonstrates that p53 is suppressive to the promoter activity regardless of the presence or absence of putative p53 binding sites. However, a low level of p53 increases MnSOD gene transcription in the presence of the intronic-enhancer element, and this effect is dependent on nuclear-factor κB (NF-κB) binding sites. Expression of p53 enhances nuclear levels of p65 with corresponding increase in the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB as detected by electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Transfection of p65 small interference RNA reduces the positive effect of p53 on MnSOD gene transcription. These data suggest that p65 can overcome the negative effect of p53 on MnSOD expression. However, when the level of p53 was further increased, the suppressive effect of p53 outweighed the positive effect of p65 and led to the suppression of MnSOD gene transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2041303655,"MAPK are activated by and orchestrate responses to multiple, diverse stimuli. Although these responses involve the increased phosphorylation of substrate effector proteins, e.g. transcription factors, the mechanisms by which responses are tailored to particular stimuli are unclear. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the Sty1 MAPK is crucial for changes in gene expression that allow adaptation to many forms of environmental stress. Here, we have identified two cysteine residues in Sty1, Cys-153 and Cys-158, that are important for hydrogen peroxide-induced gene expression and oxidative stress resistance but not for other functions of Sty1. Many Sty1-dependent changes in gene expression are mediated by the Atf1 transcription factor. In response to stress, Sty1 increases Atf1 levels by (i) promoting increases in atf1 mRNA and by (ii) directly phosphorylating and stabilizing Atf1 protein. Although dispensable for phosphorylation and stabilization of Atf1 protein, we find that both Cys-153 and Cys-158 are required for increases in atf1 mRNA levels and Atf1-dependent gene expression in response to hydrogen peroxide but not osmotic stress. Indeed, our data indicate that oxidation of Sty1, by formation of a disulfide bond between Cys-153 and Cys-158, is important for maintaining atf1 mRNA stability at high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Together, these data reveal that redox regulation of cysteine thiols in Sty1 is involved in a stress-specific mechanism regulating transcriptional responses to oxidative stress. Intriguingly, the conservation of these cysteine residues in other MAPK raises the possibility that similar mechanisms may ensure appropriate responses to hydrogen peroxide in other eukaryotes."

Whereas it is known that TGFβ signaling can be terminated by phosphatases, which dephosphorylate R-Smads in the nucleus, it is unclear whether there are any cytoplasmic phosphatase(s) that can attenuate R-Smad phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Here we demonstrate that myotubularin-related protein 4 (MTMR4), a FYVE domain-containing dual-specificity protein phosphatase (DSP), attenuates TGFβ signaling by reducing the phosphorylation level of R-Smads in early endosomes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that endogenous MTMR4 interacts with phosphorylated R-Smads, and that this interaction is correlated with dephosphorylation of R-Smads. Further analysis showed that overexpression of MTMR4 resulted in the sequestration of activated Smad3 in the early endosomes, thus reducing its nuclear translocation. However, both point mutations at the conserved catalytic site of the phosphatase (MTMR4-C407S) and small interference RNA of endogenous Mtmr4 expression led to sustained Smad3 activation. This work therefore suggests that MTMR4 plays an important role in preventing the overactivation of TGFβ signaling by dephosphorylating activated R-Smads that have been trafficked to early endosomes.

https://openalex.org/W2035877902,"The medicinal plant Psychotria ipecacuanha produces ipecac alkaloids, a series of monoterpenoid-isoquinoline alkaloids such as emetine and cephaeline, whose biosynthesis derives from condensation of dopamine and secologanin. Here, we identified three cDNAs, IpeOMT1-IpeOMT3, encoding ipecac alkaloid O-methyltransferases (OMTs) from P. ipecacuanha. They were coordinately transcribed with the recently identified ipecac alkaloid beta-glucosidase Ipeglu1. Their amino acid sequences were closely related to each other and rather to the flavonoid OMTs than to the OMTs involved in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis. Characterization of the recombinant IpeOMT enzymes with integration of the enzymatic properties of the IpeGlu1 revealed that emetine biosynthesis branches off from N-deacetylisoipecoside through its 6-O-methylation by IpeOMT1, with a minor contribution by IpeOMT2, followed by deglucosylation by IpeGlu1. The 7-hydroxy group of the isoquinoline skeleton of the aglycon is methylated by IpeOMT3 prior to the formation of protoemetine that is condensed with a second dopamine molecule, followed by sequential O-methylations by IpeOMT2 and IpeOMT1 to form cephaeline and emetine, respectively. In addition to this central pathway of ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis, formation of all methyl derivatives of ipecac alkaloids in P. ipecacuanha could be explained by the enzymatic activities of IpeOMT1-IpeOMT3, indicating that they are sufficient for all O-methylation reactions of ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis."

These findings suggest that NLK regulates important gene expressions via its ability to phosphorylate diverse transcription factors and co-factors. In this study, we show a functional interaction between NLK and FOXO1. NLK specifically associates with FOXO1 and directly phosphorylates at least eight Pro-directed Ser/Thr residues. This regulation affects the activity and localization of FOXO1. Additionally, we show that TAK1, an upstream kinase of NLK, also inhibits FOXO1. Our results reveal that the TAK1-NLK pathway is a novel upstream regulator of FOXO1. FOXO1-HA and 8×FK1tkLuc cDNA were generous gifts from Dr. W. H. Biggs III (The Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research). 3F10 anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody was purchased from Roche Applied Science; anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody anti-PARP antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-FLAG M2 antibody was from Sigma; anti-GST antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; and 9E10 anti-Myc antibody was from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. The expression of FOXO1 target mRNA was measured by quantitative real time PCR using an iCycler iQTM multicolor real time detection system (Bio-Rad). Total RNA was isolated from HEK293T cells with the Easy-BlueTM system (Intron Biotechnology, Korea), which were transfected with control (catalogue no. D-001210-01-20, Dharmacon), human NLK siRNA (catalogue no. MU-004763-01, Dharmacon), or human TAK1 siRNA (catalogue no. D-003790-06, Dharmacon) by X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of RNA using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), quantitative real time PCR was performed using specific primer sets. The primer sets were designed to span intron-exon borders to distinguish amplified cDNA from genomic DNA. The primer sequences used for PCR were as follows: human NLK-specific primers (5′-CCAGTGACTTTGAGCCTGTC-3′ for 5′ and 5′-GATGGCTGAGCAACAGTGG-3′ for 3′), human Bim-specific primers (5′-TCCCTACAGACAGAGCCACAAGAC-3′ for 5′ and 5′- AATACCCTCCTTGCATAGTAAGCG-3′ for 3′), and human p27Kip1 specific primers (5′-GCAATGCGCAGGAATAAGGA-3′ for 5′ and 5′-TCCACAGAACCGGCATTTG-3′ for 3′). The expression level from each sample was normalized to the mRNA expression level of a housekeeping gene β-actin. HEK293T and COS1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and were transiently transfected using the standard calcium phosphate protocol or Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Cell stimulation was terminated by washing cells with ice-cold PBS. Cell lysates were prepared in Lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1% Triton X-100) and subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot according to the standard procedures (21.Kim Y. Park J. Kim S. Song S. Kwon S.K. Lee S.H. Kitada T. Kim J.M. Chung J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 377: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). FLAG-NLK and FOXO1-HA were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and 12CA5 anti-HA antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. The samples were washed twice with Lysis buffer A and then twice with the buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. Finally, the immune complexes were washed with NLK kinase assay buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The phosphotransferase activities were assayed in a 30-μl reaction mixture consisting of NLK kinase assay buffer, 1 μg of bacterially purified GST-FOXO1 C1 protein, 10 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. To use a full-length FOXO1-HA protein as a substrate, the immune complexes containing FOXO1-HA isolated from HEK293T cell lysates were combined with the FLAG-NLK-containing immune complexes after kinase assay buffer wash, and the resulting immune complex mixtures were subjected to phosphotransferase assays. The kinase assay samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. Luciferase assays were performed using a Dual-LuciferaseTM reporter assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS1 and HEK293T cells were grown on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated 8-well μ-slide (ibidi) and transiently transfected with GFP-NLK WT, KN, FOXO1-HA, or GFP-FOXO1. Mouse anti-HA antibody and Alexa 568-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen) were used for cell staining according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were observed by a laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). To investigate the relationship between NLK and FOXO1, we tested whether NLK regulates the transcriptional activity of FOXO1, using a luciferase assay system based on the 8×FK1Tk reporter containing multiple FOXO-binding sequences (22.Biggs 3rd., W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, expression of NLK WT reproducibly suppressed the FOXO1-induced luciferase activity to a near control level (Fig. 1A). To examine the FOXO1 regulation in a more physiological condition, we observed the FOXO1-induced luciferase activity in an NLK knockdown condition. NLK knockdown by siRNA increased the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 (Fig. 1B). To understand the functional interaction between NLK and FOXO1, we tested whether FOXO1 and NLK physically interact with each other. We co-transfected FLAG-NLK and FOXO1-HA, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody. As a result, NLK was co-immunoprecipitated with FOXO1 and vice versa (Fig. 1, C and D). To determine the region of FOXO1 for NLK binding, we divided FOXO1 into two fragments (FOXO1 N and C), each of which represents almost half of the protein (Fig. 1E). After co-expression of NLK WT and the FOXO1 fragments, only FOXO1 C was co-immunoprecipitated with NLK WT (Fig. 1F). Notably, when FOXO1 was co-expressed with NLK WT, FOXO1 exhibited slow electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, C, D, and F, and Fig. 2A) but no change in mobility when co-expressed with the NLK kinase-inactive mutant (KN, supplemental Fig. 1 and Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained in other cell lines such as HEK293T, MCF7, and PC12 (supplemental Fig. 2). The slowly migrating forms of FOXO1 were almost completely eliminated by λ-phosphatase treatment after immunoprecipitation of FOXO1 (Fig. 2A). These data strongly suggest that NLK induces phosphorylation of FOXO1. To further map the phosphorylation site(s) of FOXO1, we divided FOXO1 into four fragments (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, only the C1 region of FOXO1 slowly migrated in SDS-PAGE when NLK was co-expressed (Fig. 2B). To determine whether NLK kinase directly phosphorylates FOXO1, we performed in vitro NLK assays using bacterially purified GST-FOXO1 C1 as a substrate. Consistent with the co-expression results (Fig. 2B), NLK WT strongly phosphorylated the C1 protein, whereas NLK KN did not (Fig. 2C). To verify that the FOXO1 full-length protein is also a substrate of NLK, we isolated the immune complexes from the cell lysates containing either NLK or FOXO1 and then mixed them together to conduct kinase assays. NLK WT, but not NLK KN, phosphorylated the FOXO1 full-length protein (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, NLK knockdown by siRNA increased the gel mobility of overexpressed and endogenous FOXO1 protein in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, E and F, respectively). Collectively, these results suggest that NLK can bind to FOXO1 and specifically phosphorylate it. It has been well established that PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibits FOXO1 via phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear exclusion (2.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5381) Google Scholar). To test whether the phosphorylation of FOXO1 by NLK is affected by PI3K/Akt pathway, we used an unphosphorylatable FOXO1 mutant by Akt (FOXO1-A3 (T24A/S256A/S319A) (2.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5381) Google Scholar). Although FOXO1-A3 was more active than wild type, its transcriptional activity was almost completely abrogated by NLK WT (Fig. 3A) similar to the inhibition of FOXO1 WT by NLK WT (Fig. 1A). NLK KN, however, did not significantly inhibit FOXO1-A3 (Fig. 3A). In addition, NLK WT was able to block FOXO1 transcriptional activity induced by wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PI3K (Fig. 3B), leading to the conclusion that NLK modulates FOXO1 regardless of PI3K/Akt activity. Moreover, consistent with Fig. 3, A and B, FOXO1 phosphorylation by NLK was not affected by wortmannin or rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of target of rapamycin (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that FOXO1 phosphorylation induced by NLK is different from that by Akt. Given that NLK belongs to the MAPK family (8.Brott B.K. Pinsky B.A. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we searched Pro-directed Ser/Thr residues in the C1 region of FOXO1. We found eight Ser/Thr residues (Ser-284, Ser-295, Ser-326, Ser-380, Ser-391, Thr-399, Ser-413, and Ser-415 in mouse FOXO1) as putative phosphorylation sites, which are all conserved among human, mouse, and rat (supplemental Fig. 3). To test whether these sites are phosphorylated by NLK, we replaced those Ser/Thr residues with Ala, one at a time, but the point mutants co-expressed with NLK WT did not produce a significant increase in mobility on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to mutagenize all eight candidate residues to Ala. Subsequently, we performed in vitro NLK kinase assays using the C1 protein or the C1-8A protein (the eight residues were mutagenized to Ala) as a substrate. Surprisingly, the C1-8A protein was not phosphorylated by NLK (Fig. 4A). In addition, NLK WT barely phosphorylated the full-length FOXO1-8A protein (Fig. 4B). Moreover, co-expression of FOXO1-8A with NLK WT did not show slow-migrating forms (Fig. 4C, middle and bottom panels). Because FOXO1-8A still strongly associated with NLK WT (Fig. 4C, top panel), we strongly believed that the failure of the phosphorylation of FOXO1-8A by NLK is not due to its inability to bind to NLK. To further confirm the phosphorylation of FOXO1 by NLK at these amino acid residues, we used a phosphospecific antibody against Ser-329 of FOXO1, one of the putative NLK phosphorylation sites in FOXO1, and we found decreased phospho-FOXO1 signal when the cells were transfected with NLK siRNA (Fig. 4D). These results strongly suggest that some or all of these eight Ser/Thr residues in the transactivation domain of FOXO1 are major phosphorylation sites for NLK. However, we did not exclude the possibility that other Ser/Thr residues in regions other than C1 were phosphorylated by NLK. To investigate whether the FOXO1-8A mutation affects the transcriptional activity of FOXO1, we performed Dual-Luciferase reporter assays and found that the activity of FOXO1-8A was higher than that of FOXO1 WT (Fig. 4E), implicating that these phosphorylation sites are physiologically relevant. Moreover, NLK did not substantially inhibit the transcriptional activity of FOXO1-8A, whereas FOXO1 WT activity was almost completely abrogated by NLK (Fig. 4E), leading us to the conclusion that these phosphorylation sites mainly mediate the regulation of FOXO1 by NLK. Next, to gain insight into the underlying mechanism of the regulation of FOXO1 by NLK, we introduced a GAL4-based luciferase assay system using pFR-luc, which contains five GAL4-binding sites (23.Qiao L. Shao J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39915-39924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We generated GAL4 DNA binding domain-FOXO1 fusion constructs, of which activities are only coupled to the activity of the transactivation domain of FOXO1, but not the DNA binding domain of FOXO1. The luciferase activity of GAL4 DNA binding domain-FOXO1 WT was strongly inhibited by NLK (Fig. 5A) but that of FOXO1-8A was not significantly hindered (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrate that the FOXO1 phosphorylation by NLK impedes the activity of FOXO1 from activating transcriptional machinery. It has been already known that FOXO1 regulates the transcriptional level of Bim and p27Kip1, each of which modulates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, respectively (24.Stahl M. Dijkers P.F. Kops G.J. Lens S.M. Coffer P.J. Burgering B.M. Medema R.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5024-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). We examined the transcript levels of both genes using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Consistent with the above data, the transcript levels of Bim and p27Kip1 were substantially increased in HEK293T cells transfected with NLK siRNA (Fig. 5B). In addition, we found that the level of PARP cleavage was increased in NLK knockdown conditions (Fig. 5C), suggesting that NLK modulates apoptosis through FOXO1. Consistently, co-expression of NLK with FOXO1 WT inhibited FOXO1-induced PARP cleavage but co-expression of NLK with FOXO1 8A mutant could not (supplemental Fig. 4). To further validate the regulation of FOXO1 by NLK, we examined the transcription levels of dInR and Thor/4E-BP, each of which is known to be regulated by FOXO1 in Drosophila (25.Puig O. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2435-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We found that the transcript levels of dInR and Thor/4E-BP were significantly increased in nemo null mutant fly (nmoP1/nmoj147-1, see supplemental Fig. 5). These results strongly support that NLK regulates FOXO1 transcriptional activity in vivo. The phosphorylation of FOXO1 on the region C-terminal to the forkhead domain has been linked to its nuclear export (26.Rena G. Woods Y.L. Prescott A.R. Peggie M. Unterman T.G. Williams M.R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2263-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Notably, one of the NLK target sites, Ser-326, has been already known to be phosphorylated by DYRK, and this phosphorylation keeps FOXO1 molecules in the cytoplasm (5.von Groote-Bidlingmaier F. Schmoll D. Orth H.M. Joost H.G. Becker W. Barthel A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that NLK not only decreases the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 but also changes its localization. To test this hypothesis, COS1 cells were transfected with FOXO1 WT in the presence of GFP-NLK WT or KN, and its subcellular localization was determined. FOXO1 was mainly concentrated in the nucleus when expressed alone (Fig. 5, D and E). However, when FOXO1 was co-transfected with NLK WT, it dramatically translocated to the cytosol, especially in the perinuclear region, although NLK WT was mainly expressed in the nucleus (Fig. 5D). On the contrary, NLK KN did not translocate FOXO1 to the cytosol (Fig. 5, D and E) and FOXO1 8A mutant does not change its localization in the presence of NLK (supplemental Fig. 6), indicating that the phosphorylation by NLK is important for the nuclear export of FOXO1. To further confirm the effect of NLK on FOXO1 localization, HEK293T cells were transfected with NLK siRNA (supplemental Fig. 7A) with GFP-FOXO1 or FOXO1-HA. In this cell line, FOXO1 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5F and supplemental Fig. 8) (27.Yamagata K. Daitoku H. Takahashi Y. Namiki K. Hisatake K. Kako K. Mukai H. Kasuya Y. Fukamizu A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Remarkably, however, down-regulation of NLK strongly induced translocation of FOXO1 to the nucleus (Fig. 5, F and G, and supplemental Fig. 8). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that the FOXO1 phosphorylation by NLK inhibits FOXO1 transcriptional activity and promotes its nuclear export. Previously, several studies showed that TAK1 is an upstream regulator of NLK (10.Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nagai S. Nishita M. Meneghini M. Barker N. Waterman M. Bowerman B. Clevers H. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 399: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 13.Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17.Kanei-Ishii C. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Tanikawa J. Nomura T. Ishitani T. Kishida S. Kokura K. Kurahashi T. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Kim Y. Matsumoto K. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 816-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18.Kurahashi T. Nomura T. Kanei-Ishii C. Shinkai Y. Ishii S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4705-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that TAK1 suppressed the FOXO1-induced luciferase activity, but it did not significantly suppress the FOXO1 8A mutant (Fig. 6A). In accordance with the results using NLK, knockdown of TAK1 increased the FOXO1 activity (supplemental Fig. 7B and Fig. 6B), and TAK1 induced slow electrophoretic mobility of FOXO1 on SDS-PAGE in a kinase activity-dependent manner (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, FOXO1 was expelled from the nucleus by TAK1 (Fig. 6, D and E). Consistent with the above results, the knockdown of TAK1 induced translocation of GFP-FOXO1 to the nucleus (Fig. 6, F and G). Finally, TAK1 down-regulation by siRNA decreased the phosphorylation of FOXO1 (Fig. 6H, top panel) and increased apoptosis (Fig. 6H, upper middle panel). These results led us to the conclusion that FOXO1 is regulated by the TAK1-NLK pathway in vivo. FOXO1 regulation is achieved by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination (1.Calnan D.R. Brunet A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). These post-translational modifications alter FOXO1 transcriptional activity, subcellular localization, protein levels, and DNA-binding affinity (1.Calnan D.R. Brunet A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Among several upstream regulators of FOXO1, the PI3K/Akt pathway, specifically Akt, is the best known regulator of FOXO1 by phosphorylation (2.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5381) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that the TAK1-NLK pathway is a novel regulator of FOXO1, phosphorylating on the residues distinct from Akt phosphorylation sites (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). FOXO1 regulation by TAK1-NLK pathway inhibits its transcriptional activity and exports it to the cytosol. In addition, we showed that down-regulation of NLK clearly up-regulated the transcription of Bim and p27Kip1 (Fig. 5B), well known FOXO1 target genes (22.Biggs 3rd., W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that the TAK1-NLK pathway has an important role in regulating FOXO1 in a manner independent of the PI3K/Akt pathway. NLK is involved in diverse signaling pathways by phosphorylating several transcription factors (16.Ohkawara B. Shirakabe K. Hyodo-Miura J. Matsuo R. Ueno N. Matsumoto K. Shibuya H. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17.Kanei-Ishii C. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Tanikawa J. Nomura T. Ishitani T. Kishida S. Kokura K. Kurahashi T. Ichikawa-Iwata E.

Consistently, NLK null mice show complex phenotypes, such as growth retardation, neurological abnormalities, and hematopoietic defects (28.Kortenjann M. Nehls M. Smith A.J. Carsetti R. Schüler J. Köhler G. Boehm T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). So far, it is not known which signaling pathway is responsible for producing these phenotypes. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the relationship between the phenotypes and the interaction of NLK and FOXO1. As we described earlier, the phosphorylation of various transcription factors by NLK results in diverse biochemical consequences, for example translocation to the cytoplasm (19.Zeng Y.A. Rahnama M. Wang S. Sosu-Sedzorme W. Verheyen E.M. Development. 2007; 134: 2061-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), degradation by ubiquitination (17.Kanei-Ishii C. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Tanikawa J. Nomura T. Ishitani T. Kishida S. Kokura K. Kurahashi T. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Kim Y. Matsumoto K. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 816-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), or decreased acetylation (18.Kurahashi T. Nomura T. Kanei-Ishii C. Shinkai Y. Ishii S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4705-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although we elucidated that phosphorylation of FOXO1 by NLK induced its nuclear export in this study, we also looked at the degradation and acetylation status of FOXO1. FOXO1 immune complexes were probed with anti-ubiquitin and -acetylation antibodies, but we did not see any difference in these post-translational modifications in the presence or absence of NLK (data not shown). Therefore, we strongly suggest that FOXO1 phosphorylation by NLK does not further induce ubiquitination and acetylation of FOXO1. The remaining question is as follows. What are the underlying mechanisms of the transcriptional inhibition and nuclear exclusion of FOXO1? It was revealed that 14-3-3 proteins bind to the Akt target sites of FOXO1 after phosphorylation, leading to masking the nuclear localization signal of FOXO1 and translocating it to the cytosol (2.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5381) Google Scholar). However, it is not likely that 14-3-3 would be involved in translocating the phosphorylated FOXO1 by NLK because the motif recognized by 14-3-3 (RSXpSXP) is different from the NLK target sites on FOXO1. In this regard, there might be a novel mechanism of recognizing the phosphorylated FOXO1 by NLK and exporting it to the cytoplasm. In this study, we revealed that the TAK1-NLK pathway is a novel negative regulator of FOXO1. Our findings will contribute to the expansion of our knowledge of FOXO1 regulation and the physiological role of the TAK1-NLK pathway. We are grateful to Dr. W. H. Biggs III for cDNA constructs.

https://openalex.org/W2091083298,"In this study, we obtained evidence indicating that annexin 1 is a new target of the p38/MAPKAP kinase-2 pathway and that it regulates endothelial cell migration in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These conclusions are supported by a series of substantiating experiments. First, by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we identified annexin 1 as a protein whose phosphorylation is induced by VEGF and is impaired by inhibiting p38. Second, using in vitro kinase assays and in vivo phosphorylation assays, we found that VEGF-mediated activation of LIM kinase 1 downstream of the p38 pathway triggers the phosphorylation of annexin 1. Third, VEGF-induced cell migration and tube formation in Matrigel are inhibited following small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of annexin 1. Fourth, both processes are rescued in cells expressing an annexin 1 construct insensitive to the small interfering RNA knockdown. Finally, the VEGF/annexin 1-mediated cell migration is impaired by inhibiting p38. We therefore conclude that phosphorylation of annexin 1 regulates the angiogenic effect that is associated with the activation of the p38/LIM kinase 1 axis by VEGF."
https://openalex.org/W2092671515,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, (PAI-1) the primary inhibitor of the tissue-type (tPA) and urokinase-type (uPA) plasminogen activators, has been implicated in a wide range of pathological processes, making it an attractive target for pharmacologic inhibition. Currently available small-molecule inhibitors of PAI-1 bind with relatively low affinity and do not inactivate PAI-1 in the presence of its cofactor, vitronectin. To search for novel PAI-1 inhibitors with improved potencies and new mechanisms of action, we screened a library selected to provide a range of biological activities and structural diversity. Five potential PAI-1 inhibitors were identified, and all were polyphenolic compounds including two related, naturally occurring plant polyphenols that were structurally similar to compounds previously shown to provide cardiovascular benefit in vivo. Unique second generation compounds were synthesized and characterized, and several showed IC(50) values for PAI-1 between 10 and 200 nm. This represents an enhanced potency of 10-1000-fold over previously reported PAI-1 inactivators. Inhibition of PAI-1 by these compounds was reversible, and their primary mechanism of action was to block the initial association of PAI-1 with a protease. Consistent with this mechanism and in contrast to previously described PAI-1 inactivators, these compounds inactivate PAI-1 in the presence of vitronectin. Two of the compounds showed efficacy in ex vivo plasma and one blocked PAI-1 activity in vivo in mice. These data describe a novel family of high affinity PAI-1-inactivating compounds with improved characteristics and in vivo efficacy, and suggest that the known cardiovascular benefits of dietary polyphenols may derive in part from their inactivation of PAI-1."

Here, we identified a novel transmembrane Trx-like protein 4 (TMX4), in the ER of mammalian cells. TMX4, a type I transmembrane protein, was localized to the ER and possessed a Trx-like domain that faced the ER lumen. A maleimide alkylation assay showed that a catalytic CXXC motif in the TMX4 Trx-like domain underwent changes in its redox state depending on cellular redox conditions, and, in the normal state, most of the endogenous TMX4 existed in the oxidized form. Using a purified recombinant protein containing the Trx-like domain of TMX4 (TMX4-Trx), we confirmed that this domain had reductase activity in vitro. The redox potential of this domain (-171.5 mV; 30 degrees C at pH 7.0) indicated that TMX4 could work as a reductase in the environment of the ER. TMX4 had no effect on the acceleration of ER-associated degradation. Because TMX4 interacted with calnexin and ERp57 by co-immunoprecipitation assay, the role of TMX4 may be to enable protein folding in cooperation with these proteins consisting of folding complex in the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2015439084,"WNK4 (with-no-lysine (K) kinase-4) is present in the distal nephron of the kidney and plays an important role in the regulation of renal ion transport. The epithelial Ca2+ channel TRPV5 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 5) is the gatekeeper of transcellular Ca2+ reabsorption in the distal nephron. Previously, we reported that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) increases cell-surface abundance of TRPV5 by inhibiting caveola-mediated endocytosis of the channel. Here, we report that WNK4 decreases cell-surface abundance of TRPV5 by enhancing its endocytosis. Deletion analysis revealed that stimulation of endocytosis of TRPV5 involves amino acids outside the kinase domain of WNK4. We also investigated interplay between WNK4 and PKC regulation of TRPV5. The maximal level of TRPV5 current density stimulated by the PKC activator 1-oleoyl-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) is the same with or without WNK4. The relative increase of TRPV5 current stimulated by OAG, however, is greater in the presence of WNK4 compared with that without WNK4 (∼215% increase versus 60% increase above the level without OAG). Moreover, the rate of increase of TRPV5 by OAG is faster with WNK4 than without WNK4. The enhanced increase of TRPV5 in the presence of WNK4 is also observed when PKC is activated by parathyroid hormones. Thus, WNK4 exerts tonic inhibition of TRPV5 by stimulating caveola-mediated endocytosis. The lower basal TRPV5 level in the presence of WNK4 allows amplification of the stimulation of channel by PKC. This interaction between WNK4 and PKC regulation of TRPV5 may be important for physiological regulation of renal Ca2+ reabsorption by parathyroid hormones or the tissue kallikrein in vivo.

IntroductionWNK (With-no-lysine (K)) kinases are large serine-threonine protein kinases characterized by an atypical placement of the catalytic lysine (1.Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S.

Each WNK kinase is encoded by a separate gene. WNK1–4 are between 1,200- and 2,100-amino acids long. Each contains a ∼270-amino acid conserved kinase domain located near the amino terminus (1.Xu B.

PHA2-causing mutations in WNK1 are large deletions within the first intron resulting in an increase in the abundance of transcript. Mutations in WNK4 are missense mutations in the coding sequence leading to altered protein function. PHA2 is characterized by hypertension and hyperkalemia (3.Wilson F.H. Disse-Nicodème S.

Interestingly, patients with PHA2 caused by WNK4 mutations, but not patients with WNK1 mutations, also have abnormally high urinary calcium excretion (hypercalciuria) (5.Mayan H. Munter G.

WNK1 has multiple alternatively spliced isoforms, including an ubiquitous long isoform and a kidney-specific isoform lacking the kinase domain and predominantly expressed in distal tubules of the kidney (7.Delaloy C.

The distribution of WNK1 and WNK4 in the renal tubules, and that mutations in them cause hypertension and hyperkalemia, suggest that they play important roles in regulating renal ion transport. Indeed, WNK1 and WNK4 have been shown to regulate renal ion transport proteins, including paracellular tight junction proteins claudins; cation-chloride co-transporters NCC, KCl cotransporters, and Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporters; epithelial Na+ channel; and renal K+ channel ROMK (11.Kahle K.T.

Hypertens. 2008; 17: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).TRPV5 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 5) channel is localized to the apical membrane of distal convoluted tubules and connecting tubules and functions as a gatekeeper for transcellular Ca2+ reabsorption in the kidney. Many hormones, including parathyroid hormone (PTH), regulate renal Ca2+ reabsorption at least partly via TRPV5 (13.Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 529-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 14.Lambers T.T. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. Kidney Int. 2006; 69: 650-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One mechanism for PTH regulation of TRPV5 is by increasing the protein expression of TRPV5, providing a mechanism for long term regulation of renal Ca2+ reabsorption (15.van Abel M. Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W. Friedlaender M.M. van Leeuwen J.P. Bindels R.J. Kidney Int. 2005; 68: 1708-1721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, PTH can enhance renal Ca2+ reabsorption within 10–15 min of its administration. The mechanism of acute regulation of TRPV5 by PTH involves activation of protein kinase A and PKC (16.Hoenderop J.G. De Pont J.J. Bindels R.J. Willems P.H. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 225-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17.de Groot T. Lee K. Langeslag M. Xi Q. Jalink K. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 1693-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that TRPV5 undergoes constitutive caveolin-dependent endocytosis and that activation of PKC inhibits this process causing accumulation of the channel at the cell surface (18.Cha S.K. Wu T. Huang C.L. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F1212-F1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This inhibition of caveolar endocytosis of TRPV5 via PKC may be one of the mechanisms for acute regulation of the channel by PTH. In the present study, we report that WNK4 stimulates caveola-mediated endocytosis of TRPV5 and thereby increases the range of regulation of the channel by PKC. This interaction between WNK4 and PKC regulation of TRPV5 may be important for physiological regulation of renal Ca2+ reabsorption by PTH or tissue kallikrein in vivo.DISCUSSIONThe TRPV5 channel forms the luminal gate of transcellular Ca2+ reabsorption in the distal nephron of the kidney and is a target of regulation of renal Ca2+ transport by pH and hormones (13.Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 529-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15.van Abel M. Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W. Friedlaender M.M. van Leeuwen J.P. Bindels R.J. Kidney Int. 2005; 68: 1708-1721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The abundance of proteins at the cell surface is a balance between retrieval and insertion of the newly synthesized and recycled proteins. Recently, we reported that TRPV5 undergoes constitutive caveola-mediated endocytosis, and activation of PKC inhibits the endocytosis leading to accumulation of TRPV5 at the cell surface (18.Cha S.K. Wu T. Huang C.L. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F1212-F1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that WNK4 kinase enhances the endocytosis of TRPV5. As would be expected, an increase in endocytosis decreases the plasma membrane abundance of TRPV5. The lower basal level of TRPV5 in the presence of WNK4 increases the range of stimulation of the channel by PKC via inhibition of endocytosis. Surprisingly, the rate of increase of TRPV5 stimulated by PKC is also enhanced by WNK4. Because an increase in endocytosis decreases the density of cargos at the cell surface, the number of channels internalized per unit time in the steady state should be the same irrespective of the rate of endocytosis. If so, one would expect that the rate of increase caused by decreasing endocytosis be the same with or without WNK4. One possible explanation for our finding may be related to the fact that there are three types of caveolae with different membrane dynamic activities (28.McMahon K.A. Zajicek H. Li W.P. Peyton M.J. Minna J.D. Hernandez V.J. Luby-Phelps K. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1001-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Type 1 caveolae are able to pinch off the plasma membrane forming endocytic vesicles and also travel to the deeper intracellular organelles, such as late endosomes. Type 2 caveolae are more superficially localized and involved in continuous rounds of fission and fusion without traveling deep below the cell surface. Type 3 is relatively uncharacterized. It is conceivable that WNK4 may alter the distribution of TRPV5 in caveolae and/or affect the dynamics of three caveolae differentially. Redistribution to a faster turnover caveolae compartment (such as type 2) may allow TRPV5 to reappear at the cell surface faster when endocytosis is inhibited.WNK4 kinase is abundantly expressed in the distal nephron including the distal convoluted tubule and the cortical connecting tubule, where transcellular Ca2+ reabsorption mediated by TRPV5 occurs (13.Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 529-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Tissue kallikrein is a serine protease produced in the cortical connecting tubule (29.Figueroa C.D. MacIver A.G. Mackenzie J.C. Bhoola K.D. Histochemistry. 1988; 89: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Tissue kallikrein activates bradykinin-2 receptor either directly or indirectly by releasing kinin from kininogen (30.Bhoola K.D. Figueroa C.D. Worthy K. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 1-80PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Hecquet C. Tan F. Marcic B.M. Erdös E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A recent study reports that activation of PKC underlies the stimulation of TRPV5 and renal Ca2+ transport by tissue kallikrein (32.Gkika D. Topala C.N. Chang Q. Picard N. Thébault S. Houillier P. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4707-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Activation of PKC is also implicated as a molecular mechanism for stimulation of TRPV5 and renal Ca2+ transport by PTH (18.Cha S.K. Wu T. Huang C.L. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F1212-F1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, our finding that WNK4 amplifies PKC stimulation of TRPV5 is likely important for physiological regulation of renal Ca2+ transport by tissue kallikrein and PTH. Further studies are required to determine how WNK4 enhances the rate of increase of TRPV5 by PKC and to quantify the importance of this effect in vivo.WNK kinases regulate many ion transport proteins by altering membrane trafficking. The mechanisms by which WNK kinases regulate these proteins are different. For example, WNK1 activates SGK1 to inhibit Nedd4-mediated internalization of the epithelial Na+ channel (33.Xu B.E. Stippec S. Chu P.Y. Lazrak A. Li X.J. Lee B.H. English J.M. Ortega B. Huang C.L. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2005; 102: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). WNK1 and -4 stimulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis of ROMK (19.He G. Wang H.R. Huang S.K. Huang C.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20.Lazrak A.

Mason A. Ellison D.H. Welling P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 8558-8563Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). WNK4 decreases cell-surface expression of the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter NCC by inhibiting forward trafficking (21.Subramanya A.R. Liu J. Ellison D.H. Wade J.B. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18471-18480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We now show that WNK4 stimulates caveola-mediated endocytosis of TRPV5. The manner by which WNK kinases regulate ion transporters via such diverse mechanisms remains elusive. We have shown previously that WNK4 interacts with SH3 domains of intersectin through a set of multiple proline-rich motifs residing between amino acids 545 and 558 (19.He G. Wang H.R. Huang S.K. Huang C.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Intersectin, in turn, recruits dynamin and other endocytic accessory proteins to participate in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles and the separation of vesicles from the plasma membrane. Fission of caveolar vesicles also requires dynamin (36.Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3017) Google Scholar). The role of intersectin in the fission of caveolar vesicles and its importance in caveola-mediated endocytosis has been demonstrated (26.Predescu S.A. Predescu D.N. Timblin B.K. Stan R.V. Malik A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4997-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27.Klein I.K. Predescu D.N. Sharma T. Knezevic I. Malik A.B. Predescu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25953-25961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our present study shows that intersectin is necessary for WNK4 stimulation of endocytosis of TRPV5 via caveolae. Moreover, the region of WNK4 involved in the endocytosis of TRPV5 is the same as that in the endocytosis of ROMK. Thus, WNK4 regulates both clathrin-mediated and caveola-mediated endocytosis by the same mechanism involving an interaction with intersectin. Our present results are in contrast to those by Jiang et al. (37.Jiang Y. Ferguson W.B. Peng J.B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 292: F545-F554Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 38.Jiang Y. Cong P. Williams S.R. Zhang W. Na T. Ma H.P. Peng J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 375: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reporting that WNK4 increases surface expression of TRPV5 and that it occurs by enhancing the secretory pathway. The precise reason(s) for these differences is unknown but may be related to differences in the experimental system employed (mammalian cells in our study versus Xenopus oocytes in their study (37.Jiang Y.

Studies using an expression system and in animals and humans, have provided compelling evidence that mutations of WNK4 that cause PHA2 increase the activity of NCC, causing Na+ retention and hypertension (39.Yang C.L.

Thus, hypercalciuria in patients with WNK4 mutations is probably, at least in part, due to the increase in the activity of NCC. In support of this idea, inhibition of NCC by thiazide diuretics ameliorates hypercalciuria in patients or animal models of PHA2 with WNK4 mutations (5.Mayan H. Munter G. Shaharabany M. Mouallem M.

This is due to an increased interaction of mutant WNK4's with intersectin (19.He G. Wang H.R. Huang S.K. Huang C.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our present study shows that a disease mutant WNK4 exerts a greater inhibition of TRPV5 than wild type WNK4. These results raise the possibility that WNK4 regulation of TRPV5 may also be contributory to hypercalciuria in PHA2. Further studies of TRPV5 expression in PHA2 patients and/or animal models are required. IntroductionWNK (With-no-lysine (K)) kinases are large serine-threonine protein kinases characterized by an atypical placement of the catalytic lysine (1.Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S.

Mammalian WNK kinases consist of four members, named WNK1–4 (1.Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Each WNK kinase is encoded by a separate gene. WNK1–4 are between 1,200- and 2,100-amino acids long. Each contains a ∼270-amino acid conserved kinase domain located near the amino terminus (1.Xu B.

PHA2-causing mutations in WNK1 are large deletions within the first intron resulting in an increase in the abundance of transcript. Mutations in WNK4 are missense mutations in the coding sequence leading to altered protein function. PHA2 is characterized by hypertension and hyperkalemia (3.Wilson F.H. Disse-Nicodème S.

WNK1 has multiple alternatively spliced isoforms, including an ubiquitous long isoform and a kidney-specific isoform lacking the kinase domain and predominantly expressed in distal tubules of the kidney (7.Delaloy C.

The distribution of WNK1 and WNK4 in the renal tubules, and that mutations in them cause hypertension and hyperkalemia, suggest that they play important roles in regulating renal ion transport. Indeed, WNK1 and WNK4 have been shown to regulate renal ion transport proteins, including paracellular tight junction proteins claudins; cation-chloride co-transporters NCC, KCl cotransporters, and Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporters; epithelial Na+ channel; and renal K+ channel ROMK (11.Kahle K.T.

Many hormones, including parathyroid hormone (PTH), regulate renal Ca2+ reabsorption at least partly via TRPV5 (13.Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 529-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 14.Lambers T.T. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. Kidney Int. 2006; 69: 650-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One mechanism for PTH regulation of TRPV5 is by increasing the protein expression of TRPV5, providing a mechanism for long term regulation of renal Ca2+ reabsorption (15.van Abel M.

In addition, PTH can enhance renal Ca2+ reabsorption within 10–15 min of its administration. The mechanism of acute regulation of TRPV5 by PTH involves activation of protein kinase A and PKC (16.Hoenderop J.G. De Pont J.J. Bindels R.J. Willems P.H.

Recently, we reported that TRPV5 undergoes constitutive caveolin-dependent endocytosis and that activation of PKC inhibits this process causing accumulation of the channel at the cell surface (18.Cha S.K. Wu T. Huang C.L. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F1212-F1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This inhibition of caveolar endocytosis of TRPV5 via PKC may be one of the mechanisms for acute regulation of the channel by PTH. In the present study, we report that WNK4 stimulates caveola-mediated endocytosis of TRPV5 and thereby increases the range of regulation of the channel by PKC. This interaction between WNK4 and PKC regulation of TRPV5 may be important for physiological regulation of renal Ca2+ reabsorption by PTH or tissue kallikrein in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2019950422,"TrwC, the relaxase of plasmid R388, catalyzes a series of concerted DNA cleavage and strand transfer reactions on a specific site (nic) of its origin of transfer (oriT). nic contains the cleavage site and an adjacent inverted repeat (IR(2)). Mutation analysis in the nic region indicated that recognition of the IR(2) proximal arm and the nucleotides located between IR(2) and the cleavage site were essential for supercoiled DNA processing, as judged either by in vitro nic cleavage or by mobilization of a plasmid containing oriT. Formation of the IR(2) cruciform and recognition of the distal IR(2) arm and loop were not necessary for these reactions to take place. On the other hand, IR(2) was not involved in TrwC single-stranded DNA processing in vitro. For single-stranded DNA nic cleavage, TrwC recognized a sequence embracing six nucleotides upstream of the cleavage site and two nucleotides downstream. This suggests that TrwC DNA binding and cleavage are two distinguishable steps in conjugative DNA processing and that different sequence elements are recognized by TrwC in each step. IR(2)-proximal arm recognition was crucial for the initial supercoiled DNA binding. Subsequent recognition of the adjacent single-stranded DNA binding site was required to position the cleavage site in the active center of the protein so that the nic cleavage reaction could take place."
https://openalex.org/W2042369651,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has been implicated in the negative regulation of insulin signaling. We previously demonstrated that light-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the retinal insulin receptor (IR) results in the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt survival pathway in rod photoreceptor cells. The molecular mechanism behind light-induced activation of IR is not known. We investigated the in vivo mechanism of IR activation and found that PTP1B activity in dark-adapted retinas was significantly higher than in light-adapted retinas. We made a novel finding in this study that the light-dependent regulation of PTP1B activity is signaled through photobleaching of rhodopsin. Conditional deletion of PTP1B in rod photoreceptors by the Cre-loxP system resulted in enhanced IR signaling. Further PTP1B activity negatively regulated the neuroprotective survival signaling in the retina. One of the challenging questions in the retina research is how mutations in human rhodopsin gene slowly disable and eventually disrupt photoreceptor functions. Our studies suggest that a defect in the photobleaching of rhodopsin and mutation in rhodopsin gene enhances the activity of PTP1B, and this activated activity could down-regulate the IR survival signaling. Our studies suggest that PTP1B antagonists could be potential therapeutic agents to treat stress-induced photoreceptor degenerations and provide further evidence that rhodopsin photoexcitation may trigger signaling events alternative to the classic phototransduction."

Here, we focused on N-linked oligosaccharides (NLO) of cell wall proteins in the hyphae of two developmental stages, vegetative mycelium and fruiting body. High mannose-type glycans were the most commonly found structures. In addition, we observed a novel glycan, predominantly present in fruiting body. This oligosaccharide structure was of the high mannose type with at least five mannoses and a bisecting alpha1-4 N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) at the beta-mannose of the N-glycan core. The transferase responsible for this modification, CcGnt1 (C. cinerea GlcNAc transferase 1), was identified and expressed in insect cells. In vitro activity of CcGnt1 was demonstrated. This novel glycosyltransferase belongs to the glycosyltransferase family 8 (GT8) and is predicted to be a type II membrane protein. Expression of the CcGnt1 locus was up-regulated in fruiting body, but down-regulation of expression by means of RNAi decreased the level of bisected NLO; however had no apparent effect on fruiting body formation."
https://openalex.org/W2086173339,"Multimeric pores formed in the endosomal membrane by the Protective Antigen moiety of anthrax toxin translocate the enzymatic moieties of the toxin to the cytosolic compartment of mammalian cells. There is evidence that the side chains of the Phe(427) residues come into close proximity with one another in the lumen of the pore and form a structure, termed the Phe clamp, that catalyzes the translocation process. In this report we describe the effects of replacing Phe(427) in a single subunit of the predominantly heptameric pore with a basic or an acidic amino acid. Incorporating any charged residue at this position inhibited cytotoxicity >or=1,000-fold in our standard assay and caused strong inhibition of translocation in a planar phospholipid bilayer system. His and Glu were the most strongly inhibitory residues, ablating both cytotoxicity and translocation. Basic residues at position 427 prevented the Phe clamp from interacting with a translocation substrate to form a seal against the passage of ions and accelerated dissociation of the substrate from the pore. Acidic residues, in contrast, allowed the seal to form and the substrate to remain firmly bound, but blocked its passage, perhaps via electrostatic interactions with the positively charged N-terminal segment. Our findings are discussed in relation to the role of the Phe clamp in a Brownian ratchet model of translocation."

We performed PCR analyses of mRNA from different Drosophila tissues; both of the anticipated splice variants of CPT1 mRNA were found to be expressed in all of the tissues tested (both in larvae and adults), with the expression level for one of the splice variants being significantly different between flight muscle and the fat body of adult Drosophila. Heterologous expression of the full-length cDNAs corresponding to the two putative variants of Drosophila CPT1 in the yeast Pichia pastoris revealed two important differences between the properties of the two variants: (i) their affinity (K0.5) for one of the substrates, palmitoyl-CoA, differed by 5-fold, and (ii) the sensitivity to inhibition by malonyl-CoA at fixed, higher palmitoyl-CoA concentrations was 2-fold different and associated with different kinetics of inhibition.

We found that the high levels of multiubiquitinated proteins in rpn11-1 were bound to shuttle factors. In contrast, multiubiquitinated proteins that accumulated in rpn11AXA were enriched in proteasomes.

RPN11, rpn11-1, and rpn11AXA were kindly provided by Drs. Deshaies and Verma (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). Plasmid DNA for generating an integrated derivative of Pre1-FLAG was provided by Dr. J. Dohmen (University of Cologne). DNA was partially digested with BsmI and transformed into the strains indicated in supplemental Table 1. Plasmid DNA for integrating Rpn1-GFP-HA into the chromosomal locus was provided Dr. C. Enenkel (Humboldt University). (Plasmids are indicated in supplemental Table 2.) A plasmid for integrating FLAG-Rpn7 was prepared by amplifying the gene with its native promoter and cloning into Yiplac22 (24.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar). Integrative transformation was performed after the DNA was digested with MscI. To generate a fusion of the carboxyl terminus of Rpn11 with glutathione S-transferase (GST), we amplified the DNA encoding amino acids 267–306 and cloned it into pCBGST1 (GST-CRpn11). Plasmids expressing Rad23, Ddi1, and Dsk2 with an amino-terminal FLAG epitope were generated by PCR and cloned into Yeplac112. These genes were expressed from a PCUP1 promoter by the addition of 100 μm CuSO4. All the amplified DNAs were verified by sequencing both strands. Protein lysates (15 μg in 50 μl) were premixed with 200 ng of proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin (Boston Biochem) or an equivalent volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) lacking the inhibitor. Proteasome assay buffer (200 μl; 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA) contained 40 μm LLVY-AMC (Boston Biochem) with or without 0.05% SDS. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, and fluorescence was measured using a Tecan Infinite F200 detector. Similarly, LLVY-AMC hydrolysis by immunopurified proteasomes was performed directly on the FLAG-agarose matrix. The values represent epoxomicin-sensitive measurements that were generated from duplicate assays that were repeated three times. Yeast cultures were grown in selective medium and normalized to an optical density at A600 of ∼1. Ten-fold serial dilutions were prepared and spotted on YPD agar plates and then incubated at either 23 °C or 37 °C. Aliquots were also spotted onto medium containing 0.8 mm paromomycin or 0.1 mm hygromycin-B (25.Chuang S.M. Madura K. Genetics. 2005; 171: 1477-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown in synthetic medium (∼107 cells/ml), washed with sterile water, and resuspended at A600 of 1. Ten-fold serial dilutions were spread on YPD plates and exposed to 254-nm UV light at 1 J/m2/s. The plates were exposed for 0, 30, 60, and 90 s and incubated in the dark at 30 °C. The number of colonies was counted after 4 days, and the average value of duplicate platings from two experiments was plotted. Protein stability measurements were performed as described previously (26.Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 27.Ortolan T.G. Tongaonkar P. Lambertson D. Chen L. Schauber C. Madura K. Nat.

Following incubation for 5 min at 30 °C, the cells were suspended in chase medium containing cycloheximide and unlabeled methionine and cysteine. Aliquots were withdrawn at 0, 10, 30, and 60 min. Equal amounts of [35S]cpm were incubated with antibodies against β-galactosidase and protein A-Sepharose. The gels were treated with salicylic acid, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Measurement of peptidase activity of proteasomes was examined in a native polyacrylamide gel, as described (28.Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein lysates (50 μg) were separated in steps of 3, 4, and 5% polyacrylamide and resolved at 4 °C (125 V × 3 h). The gel was overlaid with buffer containing LLVY-AMC, and the fluorescence signal was captured with a Kodak GelLogic imager. Peptidase activity of the 20 S core was stimulated by 0.05% SDS. Yeast cells were suspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA and 1% Triton X-100) containing Complete protease inhibitor (Roche) and lysed by glass bead disruption (Thermo-Savant Fast Prep FP120). Protein extracts were normalized using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and incubated with FLAG-M2 affinity agarose (Sigma). The bound proteins were released in SDS gel loading buffer, separated in 10 or 12% SDS-Tricine PAGE, and characterized by immunoblotting. Cells were grown in YPD medium at 30 °C. Cell pellets were suspended in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min on ice and then washed four times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Polyclonal anti-Rpn12 and anti-Rpn10 antibodies were provided by Dr. D. Skowyra (St. Louis University). Anti-Pab1 was a gift from Dr. S. Peltz (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ)). Antibodies against ubiquitin and FLAG were from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies against β-galactosidase were from Promega (Madison, WI). Antibodies against GST-tagged Rpt1, Rad23, Rpn11, and Dsk2 were made at Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory, Inc. (Canadensis, PA). Epoxomicin and Suc-LLVY-AMC were purchased from Boston Biochem. Enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) reagents were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and the signals were detected using a Kodak GelLogic 1500 imaging system. A high copy (2 μm) plasmid expressing Pre1-FLAG, an epitope-tagged subunit in the 20 S catalytic particle, was transformed into yeast strains RPN11, rpn11-1, and rpn11AXA. These strains also contained an integrated, epitope-tagged derivative of Rpn1 (Rpn1-GFP-HA). Yeast strains were grown at the permissive temperature (23 °C), and a part of the culture was transferred to the non-permissive temperature (37 °C) for 4 h. Extracts were prepared, and proteasomes were purified on FLAG-agarose. The precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). Incubation of the filter with anti-ubiquitin antibodies showed that proteasomes purified from rpn11AXA contained high levels of multiubiquitinated proteins at 23 °C (Fig. 1A, lane 4). A further increase in the levels of multiubiquitinated proteins was observed at 37 °C (lane 7), consistent with the growth and proteolytic defects of this mutant. In contrast, the amount of multiubiquitinated proteins that was co-purified with proteasomes from rpn11-1 was noticeably reduced (lanes 3 and 6). The immunoblots were probed sequentially with antibodies against other proteasome subunits, including Rpn10, Rpn1 (anti-HA), and Rpt1. Intriguingly, although similar levels of Pre1-FLAG were recovered from each strain (lower panel, Pre1), the amount of 19 S subunits co-purified from rpn11-1 was significantly lower than from RPN11 and rpn11AXA. Nonspecific precipitation was not detected in a strain lacking Pre1-FLAG (Ctrl, lane 1). Our initial studies were performed using yeast strains that overexpressed Pre1-FLAG (Fig. 1A). To avoid the possibility that these findings were affected by the high levels of Pre1-FLAG, we generated integrated derivatives of Pre1-FLAG in RPN11, rpn11-1, and rpn11AXA (Fig. 1, B and C). Protein extracts were prepared from cells grown at 23 and 37 °C, and proteasomes were purified on FLAG-agarose. Total protein extracts were examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B), and anti-ubiquitin antibodies showed high levels of multiubiquitinated proteins in both rpn11-1 and rpn11AXA at 23 °C (lanes 2 and 3) and much higher levels at 37 °C (lanes 5 and 6). The immunoblots were probed with antibodies against proteasome subunits (indicated on the right). A control reaction (anti-Pab1) revealed equal protein loading. Despite moderate variability in Pre1-FLAG levels, the overall abundance of other proteasome subunits was similar, with the exception of Rpn12, whose levels were significantly reduced in rpn11-1 at 37 °C (lane 5). Protein extracts were applied to FLAG-agarose to purify proteasomes (Fig. 1C). Very low amounts of multiubiquitinated species were isolated in association with proteasomes purified from rpn11-1 (lanes 2 and 5), despite the high levels that were detected in total extracts (Fig. 1B). This is evident when Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5, are compared with Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 5. Rpn10 and Rpn12 were not co-purified with proteasomes from rpn11-1 at either 23 °C (lane 2) or 37 °C (lane 5). Similarly, the ATPase subunit Rpt1 was inefficiently purified with proteasomes at 23 °C (lane 2) and 37 °C (lane 5). These results reveal a faulty interaction between the 20 S particle and components of the 19 S particle in rpn11-1. The high levels of multiubiquitinated proteins that were purified with proteasomes in rpn11AXA (lanes 3 and 6) could reflect higher levels in total extract (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 6), as well as more stable proteasomes (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 6). Equivalent amount of Pre1-FLAG was isolated from each strain, indicating that the results are not caused by variable abundance of the 20 S particle. The levels of high molecular weight multiubiquitinated proteins shown in Fig. 1, B and C, were quantified (Fig. 1D). The densitometry results do not fully reflect the magnitude of difference in total multiubiquitin levels in rpn11-1 and rpn11AXA due to saturation of the signal in Fig. 1B. Nonetheless, the quantified data clearly show that the amount of ubiquitinated proteins that were co-purified with proteasomes from rpn11AXA was ∼20-fold higher than in rpn11-1. The results in Fig. 1 suggested that the association between 19 S and the 20 S particles is significantly reduced in rpn11-1. To corroborate these findings, we integrated a lid subunit, FLAG-Rpn7, in RPNP11, rpn11-1, and rpn11AXA. Protein extracts were prepared from cultures grown at 23 and 37 °C (for 4 h) and examined by immunoblotting. A control strain lacking FLAG-Rpn7, and the same strain containing integrated FLAG-Rpn7, showed low levels of multiubiquitinated proteins in total extracts (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). The levels of Rpt1, Rpn10, and Rpn12 were also similar in these two strains, demonstrating that the expression of FLAG-Rpn7 had no adverse effects on proteasome abundance. High levels of multiubiquitinated proteins were detected in total extracts prepared from rpn11-1 and rpn11AXA at both 23 °C (lanes 3 and 4) and 37 °C (lanes 6 and 7). As noted earlier, the abundance of Rpn12 was significantly reduced in rpn11-1 at 37 °C (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Pab1 levels provide a loading control (bottom panel). FLAG-Rpn7 was immunoprecipitated to investigate proteasome composition (Fig. 2B). Large amounts of multiubiquitinated proteins were co-purified with FLAG-Rpn7 from rpn11AXA at both 23 °C (lane 4) and 37 °C (lane 7). However, the amount of Rpt1, Rpn10, and Rpn12 that was co-purified with FLAG-Rpn7 from RPN11 and rpn11AXA was similar despite the strikingly different amounts of associated multiubiquitinated proteins (compare lanes 2 and 4). Although high amounts of FLAG-Rpn7 were immunoprecipitated from rpn11-1 (Fig. 2B, lane 3 and 6, bottom panel), very low levels of Rpt1, Rpn10, Rpn12, and multiubiquitinated proteins were recovered. The levels of ubiquitinated species were quantified by densitometry (Fig. 2C). Wild-type yeast, either lacking or expressing integrated FLAG-Rpn7, contained equivalent amounts of ubiquitin cross-reacting material at 23 °C (Extract, lanes 1 and 2) and 37 °C (lane 5). However, high levels were measured in rpn11-1 and rpn11AXA. The amount of ubiquitinated proteins that was immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Rpn7 from rpn11AXA was significantly increased at both 23 °C (IP, lane 4) and 37 °C (lane 7). The co-purification of Rpn10, Rpn12, and Rpt1 with FLAG-Rpn7 was also quantified (Fig. 2C, lower panel). The failure to purify 19 S subunits from rpn11-1, using Pre1-FLAG (Fig. 1C) or FLAG-Rpn7 (Fig. 2B), suggested that proteasomes might be unstable in this mutant. Because proteasomes are essential for viability, the apparent dissociation is likely to occur during purification. A similar instability of 19 S particle was previously detected in rpn10Δ (13.Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fu H. Larsen C.N. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Vierstra R. Baumeister W. Fried V. Finley D. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 21-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test this idea, yeast cells were grown at 23 °C and treated with formaldehyde to cross-link proteasome subunits and associated factors (Fig. 3). Total protein extracts were prepared from RPN11, rpn11-1, and rpn11AXA containing integrated Pre1-FLAG, as well as a control strain lacking Pre1-FLAG (Ctrl, lanes 1 and 2). Extracts were prepared from untreated and formaldehyde-treated cells and examined by immunoblotting. The levels of proteasome subunits (Rpt1, Rpn12, and Rpn10), and a shuttle factor (Rad23) were unchanged upon formaldehyde treatment (Fig. 3A). Although Pre1-FLAG was expressed at equivalent levels (Fig. 3A, lanes 3–8), multiubiquitinated proteins were detected at significantly higher levels in the formaldehyde-treated cell extracts (upper panel). The levels detected in rpn11-1 and rpn11AXA were higher than in RPN11 (lanes 6 and 8). Pre1-FLAG was immunoprecipitated from untreated and formaldehyde-treated cells, and the co-purified proteins were examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 3B). Nonspecific precipitation of proteasome subunits or multiubiquitinated proteins was not observed in the control strain (Ctrl, lanes 1 and 2), demonstrating the effectiveness of the procedure and the specificity of the antibody reaction. Similar amounts of Pre1-FLAG were recovered from all strains, in both treated and untreated preparations. High levels of multiubiquitinated proteins were co-purified with proteasomes from wild-type cells following formaldehyde treatment (compare lanes 3 and 4). High levels of multiubiquitinated proteins were purified with proteasomes from rpn11AXA, both in the presence and in the absence of cross-linking (lanes 8 and 7). The co-purification of Rpn10, Rpn12, and Rad23 with proteasomes from rpn11AXA was similarly elevated. Significantly, chemical cross-linking allowed us to detect proteasome subunits and ubiquitinated proteins in proteasomes isolated from rpn11-1 (compare lanes 5 and 6). This finding is consistent with the idea that proteasomes are unstable in rpn11-1. The base subcomplex of the 19 S particle can regulate protein degradation by controlling the translocation of substrates into the 20 S particle (29.Groll M. Bajorek M. Köhler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M.

However, the peptidase activity of the free 20 S particle can also be stimulated by low concentration of detergent. We measured peptidase activity to determine whether the altered stability of proteasomes in rpn11-1 affected its catalytic function. Protein extracts were prepared from RPN11, rpn11-1, and rpn11AXA and incubated with LLVY-AMC to measure chymotryptic activity (Fig. 3C). Although proteasomes are equally abundant in RPN11 and rpn11AXA (Fig. 3A), peptidase activity was noticeably higher in rpn11AXA at both 23 °C and 37 °C. The chymotryptic activity in rpn11-1 was similar to the wild type at 23 °C but was significantly reduced at 37 °C. We speculate that high temperature might further destabilize proteasomes in rpn11-1, leading to reduced hydrolysis of LLVY-AMC. We measured proteasome activity in rpn11-1 extracts after the addition of SDS and detected ∼4- and ∼15-fold higher levels at 23 and 37 °C. We propose that proteasome dissociation in rpn11-1 might result in the accumulation of 20 S particles. SDS-stimulated activity was also higher in rpn11AXA than in RPN11, demonstrating that both mutants retained robust hydrolytic activity. Protein extracts were incubated with FLAG-agarose, and peptidase activity that was purified with Pre1-FLAG was measured. In the absence of SDS, proteasomes purified from rpn11-1 showed slightly lower peptidase activity than in wild-type proteasomes (at 23 °C). However, peptidase activity was markedly reduced at 37 °C, consistent with the increased instability of proteasomes in rpn11-1 at higher temperature. Proteasomes purified from rpn11AXA showed high chymotryptic activity at both 23 °C and 37 °C. At 37 °C, peptidase activity of rpn11AXA proteasomes was almost 8-fold higher than rpn11-1 proteasomes. The addition of SDS resulted in higher activity in both rpn11-1 and rpn11AXA proteasomes when compared with RPN11. However, an overall decrease in LLVY-AMC hydrolysis (when compared with extract) could be due to an inhibitory effect of SDS on immobilized proteasomes (see Fig. 7C). Nonetheless, the pattern of peptidase activities in the three strains, in the presence or absence of SDS, is similar in extracts and purified proteasomes. The defects of rpn11-1 are caused by the loss of 31 residues from the carboxyl terminus. We investigated whether the expression of this domain in trans could alleviate the growth and proteolytic defects of rpn11-1. A recent study showed that the C-terminal one-third of Rpn11 could overcome the mitochondrial and DNA repair defects of rpn11-1 (22.Rinaldi T. Hofmann L. Gambadoro A. Cossard R. Livnat-Levanon N. Glickman M.H. Frontali L. Delahodde A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1022-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) but not its proteolytic deficiency. We expressed the carboxyl-terminal 39 residues of rpn11-1 (GST-CRpn11) in RPN11 and rpn11-1 (Fig. 4). GST-CRpn11 did not cause any adverse effects in the wild-type strain. Ten-fold dilutions were spotted onto agar-containing medium and incubated at either 23 °C or 37 °C. The temperature-sensitive growth defect of rpn11-1 was partially suppressed by GST-CRpn11 but not by GST (Fig. 4A). GST-CRpn11 also enabled growth at the semipermissive temperature (30 °C) on medium containing the translational inhibitors paromomycin and hygromycin-B. Both drugs generate high levels of damaged proteins and provide a rapid way to examine proteolytic proficiency (25.Chuang S.M. Madura K. Genetics. 2005; 171: 1477-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The partial suppression of the growth defect of rpn11-1 by GST-CRpn11 was accompanied by a moderate recovery of proteasome function (see Fig. 5). The UV sensitivity of rpn11-1 was restored to wild-type levels by GST-CRpn11 (Fig. 4B), consistent with a recent report that showed that the carboxyl-terminal 100 amino acid residues suppressed the methyl methane sulfonate sensitivity of rpn11-1 (23.Rinaldi T. Pick E. Gambadoro A. Zilli S. Maytal-Kivity V. Frontali L. Glickman M.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To measure proteolytic activity, we transformed RPN11 and rpn11-1 with plasmids encoding the proteolytic substrate Arg-β-galactosidase or a control protein Met-β-galactosidase (26.Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). We also expressed GST in RPN11 and either GST or GST-CRpn11 in rpn11-1. GST had no effect on the stability of Arg-β-galactosidase in the wild-type strain (RPN11). Arg-β-galactosidase was stabilized in rpn11-1 containing GST (Fig. 4C, middle panel), but degradation was partially restored by expressing GST-CRpn11. The half-life of Arg-β-galactosidase was determined to be <5 min in the wild-type strain and ∼30 min in rpn11-1. Expression of GST-CRpn11 reduced the stability of Arg-β-galactosidase to ∼10 min.FIGURE 5The carboxyl terminus of Rpn11 increases the levels of intact proteasomes.A, we used a fluorogenic assay to measures the cleavage of LLVY-AMC in wild type, rpn11-1, and rpn11AXA. Proteasomes appear unstable or poorly assembled in rpn11-1, as judged by the high levels of free catalytic 20 S particles and low levels of intact proteasomes (upper panel, lane 2). Proteins resolved in the native gel were transferred to nitrocellulose and then probed with antibodies against the 20 S subunit Pre1-FLAG (lower panel, WB). B, to determine the mechanism of suppression of rpn11-1 by GST-CRpn11, peptidase activity was measured in RPN11 and rpn11-1 extracts containing either GST or GST-CRpn11. The level of intact proteasomes was partially restored in rpn11-1 expressing GST-CRpn11 but not GST (lane 4). Expression"
