https://openalex.org/W2140490890,"The structure of the active form of the MAP kinase ERK2 has been solved, phosphorylated on a threonine and a tyrosine residue within the phosphorylation lip. The lip is refolded, bringing the phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine into alignment with surface arginine-rich binding sites. Conformational changes occur in the lip and neighboring structures, including the P+1 site, the MAP kinase insertion, the C-terminal extension, and helix C. Domain rotation and remodeling of the proline-directed P+1 specificity pocket account for the activation. The conformation of the P+1 pocket is similar to a second proline-directed kinase, CDK2-CyclinA, thus permitting the origin of this specificity to be defined. Conformational changes outside the lip provide loci at which the state of phosphorylation can be felt by other cellular components."
https://openalex.org/W2036999913,"β-catenin is essential for cadherin-based cell adhesion and Wnt/Wingless growth factor signaling. In these roles, it binds to cadherins, Tcf-family transcription factors, and the tumor suppressor gene product Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC). A core region of β-catenin, composed of 12 copies of a 42 amino acid sequence motif known as an armadillo repeat, mediates these interactions. The three-dimensional structure of a protease-resistant fragment of β-catenin containing the armadillo repeat region has been determined. The 12 repeats form a superhelix of helices that features a long, positively charged groove. Although unrelated in sequence, the β-catenin binding regions of cadherins, Tcfs, and APC are acidic and are proposed to interact with this groove."

https://openalex.org/W2096955693,"Many functions of the chaperone, heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), are inhibited by the drug geldanamycin that specifically binds hsp90. We have studied an amino-terminal domain of hsp90 whose crystal structure has recently been solved and determined to contain a geldanamycin-binding site. We demonstrate that, in solution, drug binding is exclusive to this domain. This domain also binds ATP linked to Sepharose through the γ-phosphate. Binding is specific for ATP and ADP and is inhibited by geldanamycin. Mutation of four glycine residues within two proposed ATP binding motifs diminishes both geldanamycin binding and the ATP-dependent conversion of hsp90 to a conformation capable of binding the co-chaperone p23. Since p23 binding requires regions outside the 1–221 domain of hsp90, these results indicate a common site for nucleotides and geldanamycin that regulates the conformation of other hsp90 domains.

A. 1996; 93: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Additionally, hsp90 has been shown to participate in the refolding of certain misfolded proteins (18Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19Schneider C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E. Ouerfelli O. Danishefsky S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13443-13450Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). hsp90 comprises the core of several multi-molecular chaperone complexes that interact with proteins at different stages of their maturation. The ability of hsp90 to participate in the assembly of multiple higher order chaperone complexes no doubt contributes to its involvement in diverse cellular pathways, although those factors regulating such participation remain unclear. Until recently, yeast in which hsp90 is either mutated or conditionally suppressed has served as the only means by which to study the many functions of this chaperone in the cell. The recent observation that a class of drugs known as benzoquinone ansamycins, including herbimycin A and geldanamycin (GA), specifically bind and inhibit hsp90 and grp94 has provided a new tool for functional studies of these chaperones (9Chavany C. Mimnaugh E. Miller P. Bitton R. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Whitesell L. Schnur R. Moyer J.D. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4974-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 21Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. DeCosta B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Indeed, a study of structure-activity relationships has demonstrated a high correlation between the biologic effects of the benzoquinone ansamycins and their ability to bind hsp90 (22An W.G. Schnur R.C. Neckers L. Blagosklonny M.V. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1997; 40: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These drugs have also been shown to possess anti-tumor activity in preclinical models, identifying the hsp90 chaperone family as a novel target for anti-cancer drug development (23Supko J.G. Hickman R.L. Grever M.R. Malspeis L. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1995; 36: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). For these reasons, it is of much interest to characterize the drug binding site in hsp90, both to understand how GA interferes with hsp90 function and to allow for the design of novel chaperone antagonists with greater activity. Toward this end, Stebbins et al. (24Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar) have recently analyzed the crystal structure of an amino-terminal fragment of hsp90. This revealed a binding pocket for GA, and the authors have proposed that this hydrophobic pocket is a site for interaction with denatured protein substrates. Interestingly, this pocket also contains a unique glycine-rich ATP binding motif, first identified in a bacterial topoisomerase (25Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gadelle D. Varoutas P.-C. Nicolas A. Forterre P. Nature. 1997; 386: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). A recent study of the binding of hsp90 to one of its partner proteins, p23, has implicated a relationship between the binding of GA and nucleotides to hsp90 (26Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). ATP is essential for the formation of an hsp90 state that is able to bind p23, and this ATP effect is blocked by GA and also by ADP. However, the proposal that hsp90 is an ATP-binding protein (27Csermely P. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4943-4950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Csermely P. Kajtár J. Hollósi M. Jalsovszky G. Holly S. Kahn C.R. Gergely Jr., P. Söti C. Mihály K. Somogyi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1901-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nadeau K. Das A. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1479-1487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has met with resistance (30Jakob U. Scheibel T. Bose S. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10035-10041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5152-5156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Several conventional methods for demonstrating ATP binding have failed, and the use of fluorescent or photoaffinity labeling analogs has not been successful. Furthermore, hsp90 has a passive chaperoning activity, to retard the aggregation of denatured proteins, that does not require ATP (32Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 33Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In the present study, we confirm that, in solution, GA binds to the amino-terminal portion of hsp90. In addition, we show that the same region of hsp90 does indeed bind to ATP when the nucleotide is linked to a solid support through its γ-phosphate. This interaction is blocked by GA, indicating a common site of interaction. Finally, mutation of several glycine residues within the ATP binding motif markedly diminishes GA binding to full-length hsp90, further supporting a common site of interaction of GA and nucleotides in the amino-terminal domain of this chaperone. γ-Phosphate-linked ATP-Sepharose (available from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was synthesized according to the protocol of Haystead et al.(34Haystead C.M.M. Gregory P. Sturgill T.W. Haystead T.A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which links adenosine-5′-(γ-4-aminophenyl) triphosphate to Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) through a six-carbon spacer. The efficiency of this coupling was calculated to be 15 μmol of ligand/ml of Sepharose resin, as determined by analytical reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography of unincorporated adenosine-5′-(γ-4-aminophenyl) triphosphate. Human hsp90β was overexpressed in insect Sf9 cells following the protocol of Alnemri and Litwack (35Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5387-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Purification was carried out as described previously (26Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) with the following changes in chromatographic procedures. After DEAE-cellulose fractionation, the hydroxylapatite column was replaced with a heparin-agarose column. Elution from heparin-agarose was with a 50–500 mm KCl gradient. Those fractions containing hsp90 (as determined by SDS-PAGE) were then dialyzed in 10 mmTris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT (dithiothreitol), pH 7.5, diluted 1:2 with water, and loaded onto a Mono-Q fast protein liquid chromatography column (Pharmacia) for elution with a 0–1 m KCl gradient. Finally, peak fractions from the Mono-Q column were pooled and fractionated by size on a Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia). The Superdex peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4, for storage at −70 °C. It was assayed at >98% purity by scanning densitometry of a stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The C507 fragment of chicken hsp90 (described below) was overexpressed in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) following Novagen's pET system protocols. Purification followed that described previously for full-length hsp90 (26Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) except that peak fractions from the Mono-Q column were then fractionated on a Superdex 200 column. The peak fractions from this column were dialyzed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4, and stored at −70 °C. The purity of this preparation was comparable to that of the hsp90 preparation above. Plasmid WT7.11 containing the cDNA sequence of chicken hsp90 subcloned in the SP6 orientation into the BamHI and SphI sites of pGEM-7Z (Promega) was the starting material for mutagenesis. Single amino acids were changed using the polymerase chain reaction-based protocol of splice overlap extension (36Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The amplification product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and the resultant fragment was purified and subcloned into similarly prepared pGEM-7Z. Correct mutant synthesis was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing of the plasmid inserts. Nomenclature for the mutant constructs follows the practice of listing the residue to be changed (using single-letter amino acid codes), the position of that residue on chicken hsp90α, and the amino acid to which it was changed. For example, G94D refers to a glycine to aspartic acid change at position 94. The sole exception to this system is the mutant 3G3V, which replaces three glycines at positions 131, 134, and 136 with valines. Full-length chicken hsp90 cDNA and the N221, N303, N380, and N538 amino-terminal deletion mutants, all subcloned into pGEM-4Z (Promega), have been described previously (37Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20373-20379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C507 mutant was created using polymerase chain reaction to insert aSalI restriction site in the full-length hsp90 cDNA following the codon for amino acid 221. Taking advantage of theSalI site in the multiple cloning region of pGEM-4Z (Promega), the plasmid was then digested with SalI and re-ligated. Thus, the C507 deletion mutant encodes only the amino-terminal 221 amino acids of hsp90. For expression of C507 inE. coli, the insert from this plasmid was excised withBamHI and SalI and ligated into pET23a (Novagen) that had been cleaved with the same enzymes. An ATP-Sepharose column was made by loading 0.5 ml of γ-phosphate-linked ATP-Sepharose (equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) into a 1-ml tuberculin syringe. The resin was then washed with 10 ml of elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 20 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 20 mmNa2MoO4, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, Sigma, pH 7.5). One hundred μg of purified hsp90 was loaded onto the column. Collection of 1-ml fractions began at this point. Nonbinding protein was washed from the column with 5 ml of elution buffer. Following this wash, an ATP gradient (0–20 mm) was used to elute hsp90 from the ATP-Sepharose resin. All chromatography was performed at room temperature (22 °C). Fractions were resolved using SDS-PAGE and analyzed for protein content by scanning densitometry of the stained gel. The ATP concentration of each fraction was determined by the measuring absorption at 259 nm. The typical ATP-Sepharose binding assay was performed in 200 μl of incubation buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 20 mmNa2MoO4, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5. The assay tubes contained 25 μl of pre-equilibrated ATP-Sepharose plus 5 μg of the assay protein. Tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, with mixing every 5 min to resuspend the resin. In competition assays, free nucleotide was included in the incubation buffer prior to addition of protein. Following incubation, samples were chilled on ice, and the resin was pelleted. The supernatant containing unbound protein was removed, and the ATP-Sepharose pellet was washed four times with 1-ml volume of ice-cold incubation buffer. Bound protein was eluted from the resin by boiling in SDS sample buffer for subsequent SDS-PAGE. GA, obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, NCI, was derivatized to Affi-Gel beads (Bio-Rad) as described previously (21Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. DeCosta B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Derivatized beads were stored in TNESV cell lysis buffer (see below) at 4 °C and used within 1 week of preparation. 17-Amino-22-(4′azido-3′-[125]iodophenacyl)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (DMGA, 2000 Ci/mmol, a GA derivative containing a photoaffinity label (38Schnur R.C. Corman M.L. J. Labeled Compd. Radiopharm. 1994; 34: 529-535Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar)) was obtained from Dr. James Moyer (Pfizer Central Research, Groton, CT). Full-length chicken hsp90 (wild type), deletion constructs, and point mutants were transcribed/translated using TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega Corp.) in the presence of translation grade [35S]methionine (1458 Ci/mmol, ICN) using SP6 polymerase and following manufacturer's instructions. Following translation, 1 μl was removed for analysis of translation efficiency, and the remaining lysates were diluted 1:20 with TNESV buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin). The solid-phase GA binding assay was performed as described previously (21Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. DeCosta B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), using either GA-derivatized Affi-Gel beads or control Affi-Gel beads (blocked with glycine). In some cases, variable amounts of unlabeled GA or geldampicin were added to the lysate prior to addition of the GA-derivatized beads. Geldampicin is a GA derivative that is at least 2 logs less biologically active than GA and binds hsp90 very poorly (21Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. DeCosta B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Both total translation extract (1 μl) and the material bound to GA (or control) beads was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7% gels). Gels were fixed, enhanced, dried, and exposed at −70 °C for 1–24 h. Films were scanned into a Macintosh computer, and band densities were obtained using Adobe Photoshop and NIH Image software. GA bead binding data were corrected for the translation efficiency of each construct. The amount of binding to control beads was uniformly less than 1% the amount bound to GA-derivatized beads. In the data presented in Figs. 1 and 2, hsp90 binding to GA beads was quantified as follows. Material remaining bound to the beads after four washes in TNESV buffer was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed, placed in plastic wrap, and exposed to film at 4 °C for 24–48 h. The developed film was used as a template to overlay the gel. Radioactive hsp90 bands were excised with a razor blade, minced, and placed in 10 ml of Aquasol scintillation fluid (NEN Life Science Products). Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting and femtomoles of hsp90 bound to the beads was calculated by correcting for the specific activities of the individual hsp90 fragments translated. Representative specific activities of each construct, expressed as cpm × 10−3/pmol, were as follows: wild type hsp90, 28.50; N221, 19.63; N303, 19.50; N380, 17.97; N538, 12.01; C507, 9.03.Figure 2The specificity of hsp90 binding to geldanamycin. Radiolabeled hsp90 was prepared by in vitro translation and aliquoted to several tubes containing GA beads. A shows the competitive effect of increasing concentrations of soluble GA or geldampicin (GM) on the binding of full-length hsp90 to GA beads. B, shows a similar experiment using the C507 hsp90 fragment. The quantitation of GA binding was performed as described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ten micrograms of hsp90 purified from bovine brain (Stressgen Biotechnology Corp.) was reacted in the dark with 2 μCi (29 nm) of [125I]DMGA in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 10 min and then exposed to 254 nm ultraviolet light for 20 min, chilled on ice, and heat-inactivated at 95 °C for 3 min. After SDS-PAGE the gel was autoradiographed, and using the radiograph as template, the radioactive hsp90 band was excised and subjected to limited proteolysis with V8 protease as described previously (21Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. DeCosta B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE and transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the smallest labeled fragment also staining with Coomassie Blue dye (approximately 10–12 kDa, estimated to contain approximately 20–25 pmol of protein) was cut out and processed for protein micro-sequence analysis. Briefly, the photoaffinity labeled protein was reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C-8 column and a trifluoroacetic acid/water/acetonitrile gradient. The resulting pools were then analyzed for label, and the pool with activity was subjected to sequence analysis on a Beckman 2090 protein sequencer to determine the identity of the labeled peptide. 35S-Labeled hsp90 point mutants were expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate using the TnT combined transcription/translation system (Promega). A 25-μl aliquot was taken out and added to 175 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Na2MoO4, pH 7.5, with or without 5 μg/ml geldanamycin (3.6 μm). The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. Then 5 mm ATP and an ATP regeneration system (10 mm phosphocreatine and 7 units of creatine phosphokinase) were added. To enhance hsp90 recovery, the reticulocyte lysate was supplemented with 1–2 μg of purified, bacterially expressed human p23, prepared as described previously (26Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This mixture was then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the reactions were chilled on ice and added to anti-p23 antibody JJ3 (39Johnson J.L. Beito T.G. Krco C.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) bound to protein A-Sepharose for a 1-h immunoprecipitation on ice with frequent mixing. The resin pellets were then washed four times with 1-ml volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling 2 min in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE for subsequent transfer to nitrocellulose and autoradiography. Examination of the binding to GA beads of in vitro translated full-length hsp90 and several amino-terminal deletion mutants revealed that binding was entirely dependent on the amino-terminal portion of the chaperone (Fig.1). In two independent experiments, we observed that deletion of the amino-terminal 221 amino acids from hsp90 abrogated GA binding. Additional amino-terminal deletions did not restore binding. When an hsp90 fragment containing only the amino-terminal 221 amino acids was tested (C507), this construct bound to GA-derivatized beads as efficiently as the full-length protein. These data thus localize the GA-binding site in solution to the amino-terminal 221 amino acids of hsp90 and confirm the recent structural studies of Stebbins et al. (24Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). To characterize further the binding of wild type hsp90 and the C507 deletion mutant, we examined the ability of soluble GA or soluble geldampicin to block binding to solid phase GA. The data in Fig.2 A demonstrate that soluble GA is able to block the binding of wild type hsp90 to GA-derivatized beads with an IC50 between 0.1 and 0.2 μm, whereas the IC50 of soluble geldampicin is approximately 10 μm. Since the amount of GA derivatized to the resin is not known and may vary from batch to batch, these values only reflect relative IC50 values. Nonetheless, it is valid to compare the efficiencies of soluble geldampicin and GA in competing with the same preparation of GA-derivatized beads. The 2 orders of magnitude difference in efficiencies observed is consistent with the differingin vivo potencies of these two ansamycins. 2L. M. Neckers, J. Clark, E. Mimnaugh, H. Krutzsch, H.-J. Ochel, T. W. Schulte, and E. Sausville, unpublished observations. When the C507 hsp90 fragment was tested in a similar fashion (using a different preparation of GA-derivatized beads), soluble GA inhibited binding at an IC50 of between 0.4 and 0.5 μm, whereas soluble geldampicin at 10 μm had no inhibitory effect (Fig. 2 B). To confirm and extend the data obtained with hsp90 deletion mutants, we utilized a previously described iodinated, photoaffinity label derivative of GA (38Schnur R.C. Corman M.L. J. Labeled Compd. Radiopharm. 1994; 34: 529-535Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After incubating purified hsp90 with this reagent and subjecting the labeled hsp90 to limited proteolysis with V8 protease, we obtained a 10-kDa labeled peptide. Microsequence analysis of the first 10 amino acids of this hsp90 fragment yielded a predicted 10,032-dalton peptide of the sequence, TLTDPSKLDSGKELHINLIPNKQDRTLTIVDTGIGMTKADLINNLGTIAKSGTKAFMEALQAGADISMIGQFGVGFYSAYLVAEKVTVITKHND. This sequence lies within the amino-terminal fragment previously identified, corresponding to amino acids 62–155 of chicken hsp90. It is also 80% homologous to amino acids 137–218 of human GRP94. A previous study examining the possibility of ATP binding by hsp90 demonstrated that, unlike the known ATP-binding protein hsc70, hsp90 did not bind specifically to ATP immobilized on agarose (30Jakob U. Scheibel T. Bose S. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10035-10041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, linkage of ATP to the agarose substrate was via C-8 of adenine, creating a steric barrier to any proteins that require the availability of this moiety for ATP binding. Negative results were also obtained using ATP-Sepharose with linkage from the ribose. Crystallographic data show that some protein kinases, including cyclic A kinase, bind ATP through adenine, leaving the phosphate groups exposed (40Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Eyck L.F.T. Ashford V.A. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 41Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We have previously described the synthesis of γ-phosphate-linked ATP-Sepharose, a resin that permits this type of binding (34Haystead C.M.M. Gregory P. Sturgill T.W. Haystead T.A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to determine if a column formed of γ-phosphate-linked ATP-Sepharose is capable of specifically retaining hsp90. As is shown in Fig. 3, hsp90 remained bound to the column through a wash of 10 resin bed volumes. It was then eluted as a discrete peak by an increasing ATP gradient. Elution began at an ATP concentration of 0.5 mm and was complete by 5 mm. A similar binding and elution profile was observed for the C507 fragment of hsp90 (not shown). Thus, hsp90 is capable of binding to immobilized ATP. Our results suggest that the negative result seen in the earlier study with C-8-linked ATP-agarose was due to steric interference caused by the adenine linkage. Previous work on the formation of hsp90·p23 complexes from purified proteins showed that this process requires ATP, Mg2+, and elevated temperature (26Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In addition, complex formation is greatly enhanced by the addition of molybdate ions and the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40. Inhibitors of this association include ADP and GA. Using these conditions as a starting point, we examined hsp90 binding to the γ-phosphate-linked ATP-Sepharose resin. First, resin binding of purified hsp90 and the GA-binding C507 fragment were compared with that of ovalbumin, a protein without known ATP binding a"

Dvl1-deficient mice are viable, fertile, and structurally normal. Surprisingly, these mice exhibited reduced social interaction, including differences in whisker trimming, deficits in nest-building, less huddling contact during home cage sleeping, and subordinate responses in a social dominance test. Sensorimotor gating was abnormal, as measured by deficits in prepulse inhibition of acoustic and tactile startle. Thus, Dvl1 mutants may provide a model for aspects of several human psychiatric disorders. These results are consistent with an interpretation that common genetic mechanisms underlie abnormal social behavior and sensorimotor gating deficits and implicate Dvl1 in processes underlying complex behaviors."

A common intermediate of this pathway is the abasic (AP) site, that arises as a consequence of removal of altered bases by DNA-N-glycosylases or as spontaneous detachment of normal bases from the deoxyribose-phosphate backbone. It has been calculated that 2000–10000 AP sites arise each day in a mammalian cell under physiological conditions (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar). Therefore, the task of BER is engaging and important, and data obtained in Escherichia coli and transgenic mice show that this process is essential for survival (2Saporito S.M. Gedenk M.

We have recently shown that, in addition to the polymerase β-dependent single nucleotide insertion pathway previously investigated in mammalian cells (5Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), a distinct proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-dependent pathway is also present that incorporates a repair patch size of 7–14 nucleotides extending 3′ to the site of the lesion (6Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Our knowledge of the enzymology of the two pathways has several gaps. In particular, the enzymology of the ligation step is poorly defined. A role for the XRCC1 protein has been suggested on the basis of the sensitivity of xrcc1 mutant cell lines (the CHO derivatives EM9 and EM-C11) to agents that introduce DNA base damage (7Caldecott K.W. McKeown C.K. Tucker J.D. Ljungquist S. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 68-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Caldecott K.W. Tucker J.D. Stanker L.H. Thompson L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4836-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and because of their reduced rate of single-strand break rejoining following exposure to ionizing radiation or alkylating agents (9Thompson L.H Brookman K.W.

Neuteboom I. Simons J.W.I.M. Mutagenesis. 1992; 7: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for XRCC1 in DNA ligation and BER is its observed interaction with DNA ligase III and DNA polymerase β (7Caldecott K.W. McKeown C.K. Tucker J.D. Ljungquist S. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 68-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Jonhson P. Shall S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Here, we have examined directly the role of XRCC1 and DNA ligase III in mammalian BER using a cell-free system. We report for the first time that (i) xrcc1 mutant cells are partially defective in ligation of BER patches and (ii) the defect involves only the polymerase β-dependent single nucleotide insertion pathway and not the PCNA-dependent pathway.DISCUSSIONWe report here that EM-C11 cell extracts, which possess greatly reduced levels of XRCC1 and DNA ligase III polypeptides, are defective in the DNA ligation step of BER. Of the two branches of the BER pathway (6Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), only the single nucleotide insertion pathway was affected by the XRCC1 deficiency. No ligation defect was detectable in the PCNA-dependent pathway, thus indicating that ligase activities other than XRCC1-DNA ligase III are involved in this pathway. The ligation defect in EM-C11 extracts within the single nucleotide insertion pathway was partial, with approximately one-third of repair events remaining unligated after 1 h in comparison to CHO-9 wild type extracts. This indicates that the residual DNA ligase III is sufficient to complete some of the BER ligation events, or that other DNA ligases can partially compensate, at least in vitro, for the DNA ligase III defect. That the latter possibility is significant is supported by the finding that efficient complementation was achieved by addition of bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase. In vivo, one possible backup activity is DNA ligase I, since a partial defect in cell-free BER was observed for the DNA ligase I mutant, 46BR (16Prigent C. Satoh M.S. Daly G. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and a specific interaction between DNA polymerase β and DNA ligase I in a multiprotein BER complex has been recently found in bovine testis extracts (17Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16000-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). DNA ligase I could also be the major sealing activity in the PCNA-dependent pathway. The latter pathway is probably less efficient than the one nucleotide insertion pathway and can only partially compensate the defect of EM-C11.Levels of DNA ligase III protein and activity are severely reduced in EM-C11 cell extract (8Caldecott K.W. Tucker J.D. Stanker L.H. Thompson L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4836-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). The cell-free BER defect in the EM-C11 extract was fully corrected by addition of recombinant DNA ligase III but not by recombinant XRCC1, indicating that it can be accounted for by the DNA ligase III deficiency. The lack of significant effect of adding recombinant XRCC1 to the BER reaction suggests that this protein is not required enzymatically for BER, at least in vitro. Rather, taken together, these results support the notion that XRCC1 is required to maintain normal cellular levels of DNA ligase III, a role presumably reflecting a dependence of the latter polypeptide on interaction with XRCC1 for physical stability (8Caldecott K.W. Tucker J.D. Stanker L.H. Thompson L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4836-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). A very small reduction in DNA ligase I was observed in EM-C11 extracts as compared with parental CHO-9 extracts. This is unlikely to reflect any direct influence of XRCC1 protein on DNA ligase I, since these proteins do not appear to associate (11Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Jonhson P. Shall S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), but rather may reflect the decreased proliferation rate of EM-C11.In contrast to EM-C11, a DNA ligation defect was not detected in BER supported by EM9 cell extracts (12Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may similarly result from differences in levels of residual DNA ligase III, since levels of DNA ligase III were lower in cell extracts from EM-C11 cells than from EM9 cells (Fig. 6) (8Caldecott K.W. Tucker J.D. Stanker L.H. Thompson L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4836-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It is possible that the less severe DNA ligase III deficiency in EM9 is more readily complemented in the cell-free BER assay by the promiscuity of other DNA ligases. Such nonspecific complementation may not be possible in vivo due to the sequestration of different DNA ligases into different protein complexes separated spatially, and possibly temporally, within the nucleus.Although levels of DNA ligase III are the only cause of the BER defect observed in this cell-free system, it remains to be determined whether this is also the case in vivo, or whether XRCC1 has additional roles other than maintaining the level of DNA ligase III. Consistent with the latter possibility, we and others have recently reported that XRCC1 directly interacts with DNA polymerase β, and also possibly with poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase in addition to DNA ligase III (7Caldecott K.W. McKeown C.K. Tucker J.D. Ljungquist S. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 68-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Jonhson P. Shall S.

Workshop on Processing of DNA Damage: Molecular Mechanisms and Biological Effects. Noordwijkerhout, The Netherlands1996Google Scholar). On this basis, it has been proposed that XRCC1 might function as a scaffold protein physically linking together components of the BER machinery (12Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), or that XRCC1 may act as a molecular chaperone to actively target polymerase β and/or DNA ligase III to DNA repair events in vivo (11Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Jonhson P. Shall S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Alternatively, XRCC1 may possess a novel catalytic activity. One such role suggested for XRCC1 is to promote single nucleotide incorporation and so prevent excessive repair synthesis by polymerase β. It was reported that XRCC1 mutant EM9 extracts display elevated repair patch size during polymerase β-dependent BER (12Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Such a defect was not apparent in our studies, since this would have manifested as elevated levels of incorporation in experiments measuring repair replication downstream of the AP site, which we did not see (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 6). Indeed, a decrease of 52% in repair replication located 3′ to the the lesion was observed in our experiments. The latter finding suggests the possible involvement of XRCC1 protein in the PCNA-dependent pathway but clearly, whether and how XRCC1 participates in repair replication downstream of the AP site requires further study.In summary, we report here for the first time that XRCC1 mutant cell extracts are defective in the ligation step of BER and that this defect is specific to the single nucleotide insertion pathway catalyzed by DNA polymerase β.

Of the two branches of the BER pathway (6Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol.

No ligation defect was detectable in the PCNA-dependent pathway, thus indicating that ligase activities other than XRCC1-DNA ligase III are involved in this pathway. The ligation defect in EM-C11 extracts within the single nucleotide insertion pathway was partial, with approximately one-third of repair events remaining unligated after 1 h in comparison to CHO-9 wild type extracts. This indicates that the residual DNA ligase III is sufficient to complete some of the BER ligation events, or that other DNA ligases can partially compensate, at least in vitro, for the DNA ligase III defect. That the latter possibility is significant is supported by the finding that efficient complementation was achieved by addition of bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase. In vivo, one possible backup activity is DNA ligase I, since a partial defect in cell-free BER was observed for the DNA ligase I mutant, 46BR (16Prigent C. Satoh M.S. Daly G. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and a specific interaction between DNA polymerase β and DNA ligase I in a multiprotein BER complex has been recently found in bovine testis extracts (17Prasad R.

DNA ligase I could also be the major sealing activity in the PCNA-dependent pathway. The latter pathway is probably less efficient than the one nucleotide insertion pathway and can only partially compensate the defect of EM-C11.Levels of DNA ligase III protein and activity are severely reduced in EM-C11 cell extract (8Caldecott K.W. Tucker J.D. Stanker L.H. Thompson L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4836-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). The cell-free BER defect in the EM-C11 extract was fully corrected by addition of recombinant DNA ligase III but not by recombinant XRCC1, indicating that it can be accounted for by the DNA ligase III deficiency. The lack of significant effect of adding recombinant XRCC1 to the BER reaction suggests that this protein is not required enzymatically for BER, at least in vitro. Rather, taken together, these results support the notion that XRCC1 is required to maintain normal cellular levels of DNA ligase III, a role presumably reflecting a dependence of the latter polypeptide on interaction with XRCC1 for physical stability (8Caldecott K.W. Tucker J.D. Stanker L.H. Thompson L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4836-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). A very small reduction in DNA ligase I was observed in EM-C11 extracts as compared with parental CHO-9 extracts. This is unlikely to reflect any direct influence of XRCC1 protein on DNA ligase I, since these proteins do not appear to associate (11Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Jonhson P. Shall S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), but rather may reflect the decreased proliferation rate of EM-C11.In contrast to EM-C11, a DNA ligation defect was not detected in BER supported by EM9 cell extracts (12Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may similarly result from differences in levels of residual DNA ligase III, since levels of DNA ligase III were lower in cell extracts from EM-C11 cells than from EM9 cells (Fig. 6) (8Caldecott K.W. Tucker J.D. Stanker L.H. Thompson L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4836-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It is possible that the less severe DNA ligase III deficiency in EM9 is more readily complemented in the cell-free BER assay by the promiscuity of other DNA ligases. Such nonspecific complementation may not be possible in vivo due to the sequestration of different DNA ligases into different protein complexes separated spatially, and possibly temporally, within the nucleus.Although levels of DNA ligase III are the only cause of the BER defect observed in this cell-free system, it remains to be determined whether this is also the case in vivo, or whether XRCC1 has additional roles other than maintaining the level of DNA ligase III. Consistent with the latter possibility, we and others have recently reported that XRCC1 directly interacts with DNA polymerase β, and also possibly with poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase in addition to DNA ligase III (7Caldecott K.W. McKeown C.K. Tucker J.D. Ljungquist S. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 68-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Jonhson P. Shall S.

Workshop on Processing of DNA Damage: Molecular Mechanisms and Biological Effects. Noordwijkerhout, The Netherlands1996Google Scholar). On this basis, it has been proposed that XRCC1 might function as a scaffold protein physically linking together components of the BER machinery (12Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), or that XRCC1 may act as a molecular chaperone to actively target polymerase β and/or DNA ligase III to DNA repair events in vivo (11Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Jonhson P. Shall S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Alternatively, XRCC1 may possess a novel catalytic activity. One such role suggested for XRCC1 is to promote single nucleotide incorporation and so prevent excessive repair synthesis by polymerase β. It was reported that XRCC1 mutant EM9 extracts display elevated repair patch size during polymerase β-dependent BER (12Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Such a defect was not apparent in our studies, since this would have manifested as elevated levels of incorporation in experiments measuring repair replication downstream of the AP site, which we did not see (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 6). Indeed, a decrease of 52% in repair replication located 3′ to the the lesion was observed in our experiments. The latter finding suggests the possible involvement of XRCC1 protein in the PCNA-dependent pathway but clearly, whether and how XRCC1 participates in repair replication downstream of the AP site requires further study.In summary, we report here for the first time that XRCC1 mutant cell extracts are defective in the ligation step of BER and that this defect is specific to the single nucleotide insertion pathway catalyzed by DNA polymerase β. We report here that EM-C11 cell extracts, which possess greatly reduced levels of XRCC1 and DNA ligase III polypeptides, are defective in the DNA ligation step of BER. Of the two branches of the BER pathway (6Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), only the single nucleotide insertion pathway was affected by the XRCC1 deficiency. No ligation defect was detectable in the PCNA-dependent pathway, thus indicating that ligase activities other than XRCC1-DNA ligase III are involved in this pathway. The ligation defect in EM-C11 extracts within the single nucleotide insertion pathway was partial, with approximately one-third of repair events remaining unligated after 1 h in comparison to CHO-9 wild type extracts. This indicates that the residual DNA ligase III is sufficient to complete some of the BER ligation events, or that other DNA ligases can partially compensate, at least in vitro, for the DNA ligase III defect. That the latter possibility is significant is supported by the finding that efficient complementation was achieved by addition of bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase. In vivo, one possible backup activity is DNA ligase I, since a partial defect in cell-free BER was observed for the DNA ligase I mutant, 46BR (16Prigent C. Satoh M.S. Daly G. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and a specific interaction between DNA polymerase β and DNA ligase I in a multiprotein BER complex has been recently found in bovine testis extracts (17Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16000-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). DNA ligase I could also be the major sealing activity in the PCNA-dependent pathway. The latter pathway is probably less efficient than the one nucleotide insertion pathway and can only partially compensate the defect of EM-C11. Levels of DNA ligase III protein and activity are severely reduced in EM-C11 cell extract (8Caldecott K.W. Tucker J.D. Stanker L.H. Thompson L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4836-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). The cell-free BER defect in the EM-C11 extract was fully corrected by addition of recombinant DNA ligase III but not by recombinant XRCC1, indicating that it can be accounted for by the DNA ligase III deficiency. The lack of significant effect of adding recombinant XRCC1 to the BER reaction suggests that this protein is not required enzymatically for BER, at least in vitro. Rather, taken together, these results support the notion that XRCC1 is required to maintain normal cellular levels of DNA ligase III, a role presumably reflecting a dependence of the latter polypeptide on interaction with XRCC1 for physical stability (8Caldecott K.W. Tucker J.D. Stanker L.H. Thompson L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4836-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2068225054,"Low level Xist expression can be detected from both active X chromosomes (Xa) in female embryonic stem cells prior to X inactivation. After differentiation, Xist is expressed at high levels only from the inactive X chromosome (Xi). Differentiating female cells increase Xist expression from the Xi prior to silencing low level Xist expression from the Xa. The transition from low level to high level expression is regulated by the stabilization of Xist transcripts at the Xi. We suggest that these developmentally modulated changes in Xist expression are regulated by several different mechanisms: factors that stabilize Xist transcripts at the Xi, an activity that blocks this stabilization at the Xa, and a mechanism that silences low level Xist expression from the Xa."
https://openalex.org/W2039247434,"Rho family GTPases are thought to regulate actin-dependent processes, but their functions in vivo are still poorly understood. We have investigated the function of a new, widely expressed Rho family member in C. elegans by analyzing mutations in the endogenous gene. Activated and null alleles all inhibit cell migration, demonstrating that this protein is required for cell migration in vivo. Only a small subset of the migrations inhibited by activating mutations are inhibited by null mutations, suggesting that considerable functional redundancy exists within this system. Our findings support this conclusion and show that mig-2 functions redundantly with another pathway to regulate nuclear migration. Surprisingly, activated alleles also cause misguided axon growth, suggesting that Rho family GTPases may couple guidance cues to process outgrowth."

Killing of HIV-1-infected cells controlled HIV infection in a T cell line and reduced titers of infectious HIV-1 in the culture by as much as 10(4)-fold. Such a targeted virus could have therapeutic value in reducing HIV viral load.

Since the pharmacological and physiological properties of the α7 receptor expressed in oocytes are similar to those of the α-bungarotoxin-sensitive nicotinic currents recorded from neuronal preparations and the distribution patterns of α7 mRNA and α-bungarotoxin-binding sites in the rat brain are very similar, α7 is thought to be the main component of the α-bungarotoxin-binding nicotinic receptor in the mammalian brain. However, while α7 is found in purified α-bungarotoxin-binding complexes from rat brain or PC12 cells, other proteins copurify with it.

The α-BTX-binding sites in these preparations are distinct subpopulations of the neuronal nAChRs. This conclusion is based on the observations that 1) the α-BTX-sensitive nAChRs have a relatively low affinity for nicotine in comparison with the α-BTX-insensitive receptors (1Wonnacott S. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 1706-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); 2) the anatomical distribution of α-BTX-binding sites and nicotine-binding sites in the brain is highly distinct (2Clarke P.B. Schwartz R.D. Paul S.M. Pert C.B. Pert A. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 3) α-BTX binds to the surface of PC12 cells, but fails to block nicotinic agonist-mediated responses in these cells (3Patrick J. Stallcup B. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8629-8633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stallcup W.B. J. Physiol.

Ther. 1990; 253: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar); and 4) α-BTX-sensitive and -insensitive nicotinic receptors in PC12 cells and in the brain can be distinguished immunologically (6Patrick J. Stallcup W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4689-4692Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 7Whiting P.J. Schoepfer R. Swanson L.W. Simmons D.M. Lindstrom J.M. Nature. 1987; 327: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).The molecular basis for these differences have been revealed by cloning the genes encoding subunits of the neuronal nAChRs (for reviews, see Ref. 8McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 521-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). In the rat, 10 genes encoding neuronal nAChR subunits have been identified to date. Seven encode α subunits (α2–α7 and α9), and three encode β subunits (β2–β4). When expressed inXenopus oocytes, only α7 and α9 form homo-oligomeric nAChRs, and activation of these receptors can be blocked by α-BTX (9Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,10Elgoyhen A.B. Johnson D.S. Boulter J. Vetter D.E. Heinemann S. Cell. 1994; 79: 705-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Since in situ hybridization has shown the α9 subunit to be present in hair cells but not in the brain and the α9 receptor expressed in oocytes has unique pharmacological properties that are similar to those of the cholinergic receptor observed in vertebrate cochlear hair cells, the α9 receptor is thought to be involved primarily in the cholinergic efferent innervation of the cochlear hair cells (10Elgoyhen A.B. Johnson D.S. Boulter J. Vetter D.E. Heinemann S. Cell. 1994; 79: 705-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). On the other hand, α7 mRNA is widely expressed in the rat brain and is thought to be the main component of the neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR (9Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).It is unclear, however, whether the rat neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR consists of only the α7 subunit. Data supporting this notion are as follows. 1) α7 forms homo-oligomeric ligand-gated ion channels when expressed in oocytes, and the function of these receptors can be blocked by nanomolar concentrations of α-BTX (9Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gerzanich V. Anand R. Lindstrom J. Mol.

Schwartz R.D. Paul S.M. Pert C.B. Pert A. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 3) both α7 mRNA and the α-BTX-binding sites are transiently expressed in primary sensory cortical and thalamic regions of developing rat and mouse brains (13Fuchs J.L. Brain Res. 1989; 501: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Broide R.S. O'Connor L.T. Smith M.A. Smith J.A. Leslie F.M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); 4) currents elicited from the α7 receptor expressed in oocytes have fast kinetic profiles (12Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.M. Hernandez M.C. Bertrand S. Millar N. Valera S. Barkas T. Ballivet M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), similar to those of α-BTX-blockable nicotinic currents recorded from cultured rat hippocampal neurons that have α7 expressed on the surface (15Radcliffe K.A. Rajan A. Zarei M.M. Yakehiro M. Hsu J.Y. Dani J.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1996; 22: 1264Google Scholar); and 5) the α7 receptor expressed in oocytes has high Ca2+ permeability (9Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is also observed with the α-BTX-sensitive nicotinic receptor found in cultured hippocampal neurons (16Albuquerque E.X. Pereira E.F. Castro N.G. Alkondon M. Reinhardt S. Schroder H. Maelicke A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 757: 48-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).However, α-BTX-binding proteins purified from neuronal preparations show more than one band on SDS gels stained with Coomassie Blue, possibly because the neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR is a hetero-oligomer (17Kemp G. Bentley L. McNamee M.G. Morley B.J. Brain Res. 1985; 347: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Gotti C. Ogando A.E. Clementi F.

A. 1985; 82: 5208-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the chick brain, some α-BTX-binding proteins are hetero-oligomers composed of both α7 and α8 subunits (21Gotti C. Hanke W. Maury K. Moretti M. Ballivet M. Clementi F. Bertrand D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1281-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although a rat homologue of chick α8 has not been identified, it is possible that α7 associates with other neuronal nicotinic receptor subunits to form hetero-oligomeric α-BTX-binding receptors in the rat brain. There are areas in the rat brain where the expression of other receptor subunit genes overlaps with the expression of the α7 gene (22Dineley-Miller K. Patrick J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, different subunits can express in a single cell. PC12 cells, for example, have α-BTX-binding sites on their surface and express mRNAs encoding α3, α5, β2, and β4 in addition to α7 (23Rogers S.W. Mandelzys A. Deneris E.S. Cooper E. Heinemann S. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4611-4623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To determine whether the α7 subunit in the α-BTX-binding nAChR from rat brain is associated with other known neuronal nicotinic receptor subunits, we developed affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies and used them in Western blot analyses of affinity-purified α-BTX-binding sites. We found no evidence that α7 is associated with other subunits in the α-BTX-binding nAChR. The data from our experiments support the current working hypothesis that, in the mammalian brain, the α-BTX-binding nAChR is a homo-oligomer of α7 subunits.DISCUSSIONWe conducted experiments to determine the subunit composition of the α-BTX-binding nAChR in the rat brain. Using Western blot analysis, we showed that only the α7 subunit was detected in neuronal α-BTX-binding receptors purified from all four brain fractions. In addition, we calculated the ratio of α-BTX-binding sites to the α7 subunit in the receptors from these fractions and showed that it was constant (0.20). Therefore, the most straightforward interpretation for these observations is that the rat neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR is a homo-oligomer of α7 subunits with one detectable α-BTX-binding site.Several groups have reported that other proteins copurify with α7 from brains using α-BTX affinity columns (17Kemp G. Bentley L. McNamee M.G. Morley B.J. Brain Res. 1985; 347: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 35Gotti C. Briscini L. Verderio C. Oortgiesen M. Balestra B. Clementi F. Eur. J.

A. 1991; 88: 3258-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that in vivo, the neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR is a hetero-oligomer of α7 plus other subunits. We performed Western blot analyses and showed that α3, α5, α6, β2, β3, and β4 were not detected in the α-BTX-binding nAChR purified from rat brains. Although the antibodies used in our experiments did not recognize α2 and α4, both subunits are unlikely to be present in the neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR due to the observations that α2 mRNA is expressed in very restricted brain areas and α4 mRNA is hardly detected in the hippocampus, where α-BTX-binding sites are abundant (2Clarke P.B. Schwartz R.D. Paul S.M. Pert C.B. Pert A. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wada E. Wada K. Boulter J. Deneris E. Heinemann S. Patrick J. Swanson L.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 284: 314-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), and that neither α2 nor α4 mRNAs are found in PC12 cells, which also express α-BTX-binding sites (23Rogers S.W. Mandelzys A. Deneris E.S. Cooper E. Heinemann S. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4611-4623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A rat homologue of the chicken α8 subunit, which also binds α-BTX, has not been found. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that an α8-like subunit is present in the rat neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR. As shown in Fig. 1, anti-α7-rp, a polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of α7, also recognizes the N termini of α3, α6, β2, and β4, subunits that share only 40% amino acid identity with α7 in the N-terminal region. On the other hand, the N termini of the chicken α7 and α8 subunits share 78% amino acid identity. Therefore, if an α8-like subunit were in the rat neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR, it is likely that the antibody anti-α7-rp would recognize it on Western blots. Chicken and rat α7 subunits have the same molecular mass (38Schoepfer R. Conroy W.G. Whiting P. Gore M. Lindstrom J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 35-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). If an α8-like protein existed in the rat brain and were the same size as chicken α8, it might also be expected to migrate as a 60-kDa protein on SDS gels (38Schoepfer R. Conroy W.G. Whiting P. Gore M. Lindstrom J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 35-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The blots probed with anti-α7-rp were carefully examined at different exposure times, and no immunoreactive protein band of 60 kDa was observed. The α9 subunit, expressed only in epithelial cells, is unlikely to be present in the α-BTX-binding nAChR in the brain (10Elgoyhen A.B. Johnson D.S. Boulter J. Vetter D.E. Heinemann S. Cell. 1994; 79: 705-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar).Therefore, the results from our Western blot analyses indicate that subunits other than α7 are unlikely to be present in the α-BTX-binding nAChR, consistent with the current working hypothesis that the α-BTX-binding nAChR is a homo-oligomer of α7 subunits in the rat brain. A plausible explanation for the proteins copurifying with α7 is that they may be associated proteins such as cytoskeletal proteins and/or degradation products of α7.The number of α-BTX-binding sites per rat neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR is not known. However, given the assumption that the receptor is a homo-oligomer of five α7 subunits, several predictions can be made. 1) If each α7 subunit binds α-BTX in the mature receptor, the predicted number would be five; 2) if only a correctly folded α7 dimer forms an α-BTX-binding site and two such dimers plus a monomer assemble to form a mature α7 pentamer, then the predicted number would be two; 3) if only one α-BTX-binding site is formed on a mature α7 receptor or if a receptor has five possible α-BTX-binding sites, but binding of the first α-BTX sterically prevents further α-BTX binding, the predicted number would be one.We calculated the molar ratio of α-BTX-binding sites to the α7 subunit in α-BTX-binding nAChRs from all brain fractions (Fig. 7) and found that it is 0.2. This suggests that the number of detectable α-BTX-binding sites per pentameric α7 receptor is one, consistent with the third prediction above. Since, under certain experimental conditions, only one of the two α-BTX-binding sites of the muscle-type nAChR can be detected (39Conti-Tronconi B.M. Tang F. Walgrave S. Gallagher W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1046-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 40Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6692-6699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the α7 receptor consists of two or more α-BTX-binding sites, but only one is detected under our experimental conditions. In either case, the estimated molar ratio supports the current working hypothesis that the α-BTX-binding nAChR is a homo-oligomer of α7 subunits in the rat brain. α-Bungarotoxin (α-BTX), 1The abbreviations used are: α-BTX, α-bungarotoxin; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: α-BTX, α-bungarotoxin; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. a snake toxin that binds to the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), also binds to the surface of sympathetic ganglion cells, cultured PC12 cells (rat pheochromocytoma cells), and brain membranes. The α-BTX-binding sites in these preparations are distinct subpopulations of the neuronal nAChRs. This conclusion is based on the observations that 1) the α-BTX-sensitive nAChRs have a relatively low affinity for nicotine in comparison with the α-BTX-insensitive receptors (1Wonnacott S. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 1706-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); 2) the anatomical distribution of α-BTX-binding sites and nicotine-binding sites in the brain is highly distinct (2Clarke P.B. Schwartz R.D. Paul S.M. Pert C.B. Pert A. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 3) α-BTX binds to the surface of PC12 cells, but fails to block nicotinic agonist-mediated responses in these cells (3Patrick J. Stallcup B. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8629-8633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stallcup W.B. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1979; 286: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5Lukas R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar); and 4) α-BTX-sensitive and -insensitive nicotinic receptors in PC12 cells and in the brain can be distinguished immunologically (6Patrick J. Stallcup W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4689-4692Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 7Whiting P.J. Schoepfer R. Swanson L.W. Simmons D.M. Lindstrom J.M. Nature. 1987; 327: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for these differences have been revealed by cloning the genes encoding subunits of the neuronal nAChRs (for reviews, see Ref. 8McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 521-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). In the rat, 10 genes encoding neuronal nAChR subunits have been identified to date. Seven encode α subunits (α2–α7 and α9), and three encode β subunits (β2–β4). When expressed inXenopus oocytes, only α7 and α9 form homo-oligomeric nAChRs, and activation of these receptors can be blocked by α-BTX (9Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,10Elgoyhen A.B. Johnson D.S. Boulter J. Vetter D.E. Heinemann S. Cell. 1994; 79: 705-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Since in situ hybridization has shown the α9 subunit to be present in hair cells but not in the brain and the α9 receptor expressed in oocytes has unique pharmacological properties that are similar to those of the cholinergic receptor observed in vertebrate cochlear hair cells, the α9 receptor is thought to be involved primarily in the cholinergic efferent innervation of the cochlear hair cells (10Elgoyhen A.B. Johnson D.S. Boulter J. Vetter D.E. Heinemann S. Cell. 1994; 79: 705-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). On the other hand, α7 mRNA is widely expressed in the rat brain and is thought to be the main component of the neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR (9Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, whether the rat neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR consists of only the α7 subunit. Data supporting this notion are as follows. 1) α7 forms homo-oligomeric ligand-gated ion channels when expressed in oocytes, and the function of these receptors can be blocked by nanomolar concentrations of α-BTX (9Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gerzanich V. Anand R. Lindstrom J. Mol.

Neuron. 1990; 5: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar); 2) the distribution of α7 mRNA in the adult rat brain is similar to that of the α-125I-BTX-binding sites previously documented (2Clarke P.B. Schwartz R.D. Paul S.M. Pert C.B. Pert A. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 3) both α7 mRNA and the α-BTX-binding sites are transiently expressed in primary sensory cortical and thalamic regions of developing rat and mouse brains (13Fuchs J.L. Brain Res. 1989; 501: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Broide R.S. O'Connor L.T. Smith M.A. Smith J.A. Leslie F.M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); 4) currents elicited from the α7 receptor expressed in oocytes have fast kinetic profiles (12Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.M. Hernandez M.C. Bertrand S. Millar N. Valera S. Barkas T. Ballivet M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), similar to those of α-BTX-blockable nicotinic currents recorded from cultured rat hippocampal neurons that have α7 expressed on the surface (15Radcliffe K.A. Rajan A. Zarei M.M. Yakehiro M. Hsu J.Y. Dani J.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1996; 22: 1264Google Scholar); and 5) the α7 receptor expressed in oocytes has high Ca2+ permeability (9Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is also observed with the α-BTX-sensitive nicotinic receptor found in cultured hippocampal neurons (16Albuquerque E.X. Pereira E.F. Castro N.G. Alkondon M. Reinhardt S. Schroder H. Maelicke A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 757: 48-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, α-BTX-binding proteins purified from neuronal preparations show more than one band on SDS gels stained with Coomassie Blue, possibly because the neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR is a hetero-oligomer (17Kemp G. Bentley L. McNamee M.G. Morley B.J. Brain Res. 1985; 347: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Gotti C. Ogando A.E. Clementi F. Neuroscience. 1989; 32: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Whiting P. Lindstrom J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1985; 82: 5208-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the chick brain, some α-BTX-binding proteins are hetero-oligomers composed of both α7 and α8 subunits (21Gotti C. Hanke W. Maury K. Moretti M. Ballivet M. Clementi F. Bertrand D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1281-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although a rat homologue of chick α8 has not been identified, it is possible that α7 associates with other neuronal nicotinic receptor subunits to form hetero-oligomeric α-BTX-binding receptors in the rat brain. There are areas in the rat brain where the expression of other receptor subunit genes overlaps with the expression of the α7 gene (22Dineley-Miller K. Patrick J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, different subunits can express in a single cell. PC12 cells, for example, have α-BTX-binding sites on their surface and express mRNAs encoding α3, α5, β2, and β4 in addition to α7 (23Rogers S.W. Mandelzys A. Deneris E.S. Cooper E. Heinemann S. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4611-4623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the α7 subunit in the α-BTX-binding nAChR from rat brain is associated with other known neuronal nicotinic receptor subunits, we developed affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies and used them in Western blot analyses of affinity-purified α-BTX-binding sites. We found no evidence that α7 is associated with other subunits in the α-BTX-binding nAChR. The data from our experiments support the current working hypothesis that, in the mammalian brain, the α-BTX-binding nAChR is a homo-oligomer of α7 subunits. DISCUSSIONWe conducted experiments to determine the subunit composition of the α-BTX-binding nAChR in the rat brain. Using Western blot analysis, we showed that only the α7 subunit was detected in neuronal α-BTX-binding receptors purified from all four brain fractions. In addition, we calculated the ratio of α-BTX-binding sites to the α7 subunit in the receptors from these fractions and showed that it was constant (0.20). Therefore, the most straightforward interpretation for these observations is that the rat neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR is a homo-oligomer of α7 subunits with one detectable α-BTX-binding site.Several groups have reported that other proteins copurify with α7 from brains using α-BTX affinity columns (17Kemp G. Bentley L. McNamee M.G. Morley B.J. Brain Res. 1985; 347: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 35Gotti C. Briscini L. Verderio C. Oortgiesen M. Balestra B. Clementi F. Eur. J.

A. 1991; 88: 3258-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that in vivo, the neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR is a hetero-oligomer of α7 plus other subunits. We performed Western blot analyses and showed that α3, α5, α6, β2, β3, and β4 were not detected in the α-BTX-binding nAChR purified from rat brains. Although the antibodies used in our experiments did not recognize α2 and α4, both subunits are unlikely to be present in the neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR due to the observations that α2 mRNA is expressed in very restricted brain areas and α4 mRNA is hardly detected in the hippocampus, where α-BTX-binding sites are abundant (2Clarke P.B. Schwartz R.D. Paul S.M. Pert C.B. Pert A. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wada E. Wada K. Boulter J. Deneris E. Heinemann S. Patrick J. Swanson L.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 284: 314-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), and that neither α2 nor α4 mRNAs are found in PC12 cells, which also express α-BTX-binding sites (23Rogers S.W. Mandelzys A. Deneris E.S. Cooper E. Heinemann S. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4611-4623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A rat homologue of the chicken α8 subunit, which also binds α-BTX, has not been found. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that an α8-like subunit is present in the rat neuronal α-BTX-binding nAChR. As shown in Fig. 1, anti-α7-rp, a polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of α7, also recognizes the N termini of α3, α6, β2, and β4, subunits that share only 40% amino acid identity with α7 in the N-terminal region.

The blots probed with anti-α7-rp were carefully examined at different exposure times, and no immunoreactive protein band of 60 kDa was observed. The α9 subunit, expressed only in epithelial cells, is unlikely to be present in the α-BTX-binding nAChR in the brain (10Elgoyhen A.B. Johnson D.S. Boulter J. Vetter D.E. Heinemann S.

Results demonstrate that the packing of C. fimicellulases and their isolated binding domains onto the cellulose surface is a dynamic process.

Comparison with the kinetics of cellulase hydrolysis of crystalline substrate suggests that surface diffusion rates do not limit cellulase activity. Cellulases, amylases, chitanases, and other enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of insoluble polysaccharides are typically modular enzymes with a distinct substrate-binding domain joined to a catalytic domain. The substrate-binding domains appear to assist in the hydrolysis of insoluble substrates, because lower activities are generally observed following their removal by proteolysis or genetic manipulation (1Tomme P.

Cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CBD, cellulose-binding domain; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; CLSM, confocal laser scanning microscope; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PMT, photomultiplier tube; BMCC, bacterial microcrystalline cellulose. 1The abbreviations used are: CBD, cellulose-binding domain; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; CLSM, confocal laser scanning microscope; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PMT, photomultiplier tube; BMCC, bacterial microcrystalline cellulose. are found in most fungal and bacterial cellulases. They can be classified into 10 families on the basis of amino acid similarities (2Tomme P. Miller R.C. Warren R.A.J. Kilburn D.G. Gilkes N.R. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1996; 618: 142-163Google Scholar). Family II is the largest. The CBDs of seven cellulases and xylanases including CenA, an endo-β-1–4-glucanase, and Cex, a mixed exo-β-1–4-glucanase/xylanase, from the bacterium Cellulomonas fimi belong to this family.Previous experiments show that CBDCex and CBDCenA do not dissociate from cellulose after binding (3Ong E. Gilkes N.R. Miller R.C. Warren R.A.J. Kilburn D.G. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1991; 13: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4Greenwood J.M. Gilkes N.R. Miller R.C. Warren R.A.J.

A. 1996; 93: 12229-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This suggests that the enzymes must freely diffuse across the substrate surface to gain access to susceptible bonds, since enzyme activity is enhanced by the presence of a CBD. To test this hypothesis, we have determined the mobility of Cex, CenA, and their isolated CBDs on a cellulose surface using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Enzymes or CBDs, labeled with a fluorescent tag, were adsorbed to sheets of crystalline cellulose microfibrils prepared from the cell walls of Valonia ventricosa, a large unicellular marine algae. A small, well defined region of the surface-bound fluorescent molecules was then irreversibly photobleached using a high intensity laser pulse. Recovery of fluorescence in the bleached region was subsequently monitored by confocal laser scanning microscopy to determine the diffusive mobility of the bound molecules. The results of this study provide unequivocal evidence for surface diffusion ofC. fimi cellulases on crystalline cellulose and give new insights into the process of cellulase adsorption and the mechanism of cellulose hydrolysis.FRAP has been used previously to measure the diffusion of α-d-glucan maltohydrolase on insoluble starch (6Katchalski-Katzir E. Rishpon J. Sahar E. Lamed R. Henis Y.I. Biopolymers. 1985; 24: 257-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and of collagenase adsorbed to a peptide substrate covalently coupled to an insoluble support (7Gaspers P.B. Robertson C.R. Gast A.P. Langmuir. 1996; 10: 2699-2704Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In each of these systems, surface mobility of the adsorbed enzyme was thought to arise because the proteins made multiple binding contacts with the sorbent surface. Individual bonds at contact points were presumed to be weak enough to permit diffusion across the surface, but the ensemble of bonds maintained the protein at the surface. Indeed, it was suggested that the combined effect of multiple weak interaction sites on a single molecule and the dynamics of protein structure and folding oscillations could result in a molecular motion similar to that observed for a centipede (8Henis Y.I. Yaron T. Lamed R. Katchalski-Katzir E. Biopolymers. 1988; 27: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).RESULTSFig. 1 A shows images of a mounted cellulose sheet stained with the fluorescein-labeled binding domain of the exoglycanase Cex (CBDCex-FITC). The parallel array microfibril structure and uniformity of the surface is evident.V. ventricosa cellulose has a very high degree of crystallinity (>95%; Ref. 15Gardner K.H. Blackwell J. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 1975-2001Crossref Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and a high binding capacity for CBDs. Uniform, flat regions on the cellulose surface were selected for photobleaching experiments. Fig. 1 B shows a cross-section perpendicular to the surface at the axis indicated in Fig.1 A. The sheets of V. ventricosa cell wall prepared for our studies are approximately 1 μm thick. The axial resolution of the confocal microscope under our imaging conditions is on the order of 1 μm. All fluorescence signals collected during recovery monitoring thus arise within or very near the cellulose sheet.To ensure that binding of labeled and unlabeled CBDs was equivalent, binding isotherms were measured for mixtures containing 10, 20, and 50% labeled CBDCex. The affinity constants and saturation capacities of the CBD on cellulose for the mixtures were in quantitative agreement, indicating that FITC labeling of the CBD did not affect its binding properties. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy and isotherm analysis showed that CBD-FITC fluorescence intensity/mol of bound protein was independent of surface concentration, indicating that FITC self-quenching at these surface concentrations is not significant.Fig. 2 shows the binding isotherm for FITC-labeled CBDCex on disrupted cellulose fibers. The use of fluorescently labeled protein permitted data to be collected at much lower concentrations than have been reported previously. The adsorption isotherm data was analyzed by nonlinear regression using a model that includes two classes of binding sites (5Creagh A.L. Ong E. Jervis E.J. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12229-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). TableI reports regressed binding constants and capacities. The saturation capacity of V. ventricosacellulose was determined independently using a mixture of labeled and unlabeled protein. Thus, three parameters were regressed from the adsorption isotherm: high and low affinity constants and fraction of high affinity sites. The binding parameters for CBDCexagree well with earlier values determined using unlabeled CBD and bacterial microcrystalline cellulose derived fromAcetobacter xylinum (5Creagh A.L. Ong E. Jervis E.J. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12229-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Figure 2Valonia-CBD-FITC isotherms. Shown is a typical isotherm prepared with FITC-labeled CBDCex. Binding parameters derived from a two-site model for binding are in good agreement with our earlier studies using unlabeled CBD and bacterial microcrystalline cellulose. About 85% of the binding has a high apparent affinity of about 50 μm−1. The remaining 15% of the sites have a lower affinity of about 1.0 μm−1. Valonia cellulose binds about 6.2 μmol of CBDCex/g of cellulose. Theinset shows a semilog plot of the isotherm data and the fitted model.

Nonlinear regression was used to determine the high and low affinity constants and the relative fraction of each. Saturation capacities were determined independently using mixtures of labeled and unlabeled proteins. Binding parameters are in good agreement with studies using unlabeled CBD and BMCC (5Creagh A.L.

Open table in a new tab Previous studies indicate that the binding of CBDCex to bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (BMCC) is effectively irreversible (5Creagh A.L. Ong E. Jervis E.J. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12229-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The binding characteristics of CBDCex to BMCC andV. ventricosa cellulose are very similar (Table I), consistent with the highly crystalline nature of these two substrates. However, it was not certain that the binding of CBDCex toV. ventricosa cellulose is also irreversible. Because irreversible association is a critical condition in our interpretation of the FRAP measurements, this question was examined in detail. First, FITC-labeled CBD was adsorbed to cellulose sheets according to the protocol for FRAP analysis. Following washing, the protein-loaded cellulose was equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer. No fluorescence could be detected in the equilibrated buffer solution after 8 h of incubation, indicating that no CBD had been released from the surface. To demonstrate that CBD was not released from the cellulose surface during FRAP, the bottom side of the microscope slide well was sealed with a coverslip bearing a second unlabeled sheet ofV. ventricosa cellulose. This surface acted as the capture surface for any CBD that might desorb from the target cellulose surface during FRAP. After a series of FRAP measurements, the top sheet with bound protein and the bottom sheet, which initially had no protein adsorbed to it, were imaged using the confocal microscope. The confocal aperture was adjusted for a depth of field of approximately 1 μm so that fluorescence from opposing walls was excluded. The fluorescence intensity of the unlabeled cellulose sheets did not increase during FRAP experiments, confirming that the adsorption of these CBDs to crystalline cellulose is effectively irreversible under these conditions.Photobleaching Analysis of CBD-FITC on Crystalline CelluloseFig. 3 shows typical images recorded for FRAP analysis of FITC-labeled CBDCex onV. ventricosa cellulose. Fluorescence intensity measurements of the surface just prior to bleaching (Fig. 3 A) were used to normalize subsequent measurements to prebleach intensities. Gaussian profile spots were bleached with a series of high intensity laser pulses in the pattern shown (Fig. 3 B), and the fluorescence intensity was recorded over time by successive imaging of the bleached spots and surrounding area. Approximately 7 min after bleaching, substantial fluorescence recovery is evident in the bleached spots and at the interface between the bleached reference region and the surrounding unbleached area (Fig. 3 C).Fig. 4 A shows the time profiles for fluorescence intensity at the center of the bleach spot, the unbleached region of the cellulose sheet, and the center of the bleached reference region. Under the monitoring conditions selected, background bleaching was less than 5% during recovery. The bleach spot recovery profiles were therefore analyzed directly without compensating for bleaching as a result of monitoring. Fluorescence did not recover in the large bleached reference region, indicating that no highly diffusive species were present on the surface or in solution and that chemical recovery of the bleached FITC was not occurring (19Stout A.L. Axelrod D. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Figure 4Photobleaching analysis of CBD-FITC onValonia. Time profiles of the fluorescence signal for the bleach spot center (×), the unbleached region of the cellulose surface (○), and the center of the bleached reference region (•) are shown in Fig. 4 A. Less than 5% background bleaching occurred during recovery monitoring. Also, the reference region has less than 5% fluorescence recovery during monitoring. Fig.4 B presents a typical recovery profile used for the estimation of the diffusion coefficient and the mobile fraction of CBDCex at a surface coverage density of ∼60%. Fluorescence intensity is normalized by the prebleach fluorescence signal. Under these conditions, the diffusion rate for CBDCex on crystalline cellulose is 6.0 ± .5 (10−11) cm2/s. The mobile fraction of CBDCex is 70 ± 5%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Surface diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions were determined by nonlinear regression of FRAP data of the analytical solution developed by Axelrod (18Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) for the one-dimensional radial diffusion equation applied to a bleach spot with a Gaussian intensity profile, f*t*=∑n=0∞**−κ*nn!*11+n*1+*2t/τd**Equation 1 where f(t) is the normalized fluorescence intensity at the bleach spot center, t is time, τ d is the characteristic diffusion time for the molecular species, and κ, the bleach rate constant, is related to the sensitivity of the system to bleaching. The measured fluorescence intensities were normalized by the fluorescence intensity recorded just prior to bleaching. The first 20 terms in the series given in Equation1 were used to regress τ d and κ to normalized FRAP recovery curves such as that shown in Fig. 4 B. Several initial guesses were used for each fitting to ensure unique convergence of parameters during fitting.The diffusion coefficient is related to the estimated characteristic diffusion time τ d by the equation, D=ω24τdEquation 2 where ω, the half-width of the Gaussian profile (ate −2 times the spot profiles depth), was obtained by regression of the initial bleach spot profile. The mobile fraction R was determined from the long time recovery intensity by the equation, R=[Fk(∞)−Fk(0)][Fk(i)−Fk(0)]Equation 3 where F(∞) is the effective infinite time recovery,F(0) the fluorescence just after bleaching,F(i) the fluorescence intensity prior to bleaching, and F k (i) the fluorescence intensity just after bleaching.Fig. 4 B shows normalized FRAP results for CBDCexat 60% maximal surface coverage. Under these conditions, the two-dimensional diffusion coefficient for CBDCex on crystalline cellulose is 6.0 (± 0.9) × 10−11cm2/s. This diffusion coefficient is more than 4 orders of magnitude slower than the free solution diffusion rate of 10−6 cm2/s estimated from the Einstein equation for a globular protein with a mean diameter of 3 nm. If diffusion is strictly stochastic (i.e. no preferred direction or orientation), this diffusion rate corresponds to a cellobiose unit-cell transit time of approximately 0.18 ms.Based on the maximum recovery of fluorescence, the mobile fraction of CBDCex on the crystalline cellulose surface is 65 ± 5%. Therefore, on the time scale of these experiments, the majority of the CBD adsorbed to the lattice surface is mobile. FRAP analysis repeated on cellulose sheets stored in buffer at 4 °C for 48 h yielded similar diffusion parameter estimates. There were no obvious changes in the morphology of the cellulose surface or microfibril packing with incubation time, indicating that the CBD had not significantly altered the cellulose structure.Control experiments were performed to examine the effect of void spaces and the resulting potential for hindered diffusion due to molecular sieving within the cellulose fibril network of the V. ventricosa cellulose sheets. FITC-labeled myoglobin was prepared as described above. Myoglobin was selected because it is similar to CBDCex in size (17.5 kDa) and has no measurable affinity for crystalline cellulose. Mounted cellulose sheets were incubated for 4 h with FITC-labeled myoglobin at a molar concentration 5 times the saturation level for CBDCex and then washed in 50 mm phosphate buffer. No increase in cellulose surface fluorescence was observed, indicating that no FITC-myoglobin was bound to, or trapped within, the microcrystalline cellulose fibril network. Identical results were obtained when the cellulose sheet was preincubated with unlabeled CBDCex, indicating that the CBDs did not modify the cellulose microfibril structure. FRAP experiments performed with unwashed cellulose sheets containing free FITC-myoglobin gave fluorescence recovery rates at least 3 orders of magnitude faster than those observed for CBDs bound to the cellulose surface. This indicates that the fibril network of the V. ventricosa cellulose sheet imposes little hindrance to solution diffusion of the labeled protein molecule, presumably because the void space is made up of pores much larger than individual protein molecules.A series of FRAP experiments were performed with three different objective lenses (× 60, 40, and 20) to create a range of initial bleach spot diameters to determine whether the observed fluorescence recovery for bound CBDCex in FRAP experiments was due to surface diffusion or exchange between bound and unbound CBDs. For a diffusion-limited process, the characteristic fluorescence recovery time varies with the square of the half-width of the initial bleach spot diameter (see Equation 2). For a recovery process dominated by exchange from solution, two possible rate-limiting cases must be considered. If the desorption step is rate-limiting, τ d will be independent of ω. If the desorption step is not rate-limiting, τ d will be scaled linearly with ω2, and the slope will yield a diffusion coefficient on the order of 10−6 to 10−7 cm2/s. As expected for a diffusion-limited process, τ d scales linearly with ω2 (Fig. 5). From Equation2, the slope of the line in Fig. 5 yields a diffusion coefficient of 3.0 × 10−11 cm2/s. This value is in good agreement with the diffusion coefficients calculated from the observed recovery curves and is at least 4 orders of magnitude slower than the estimated diffusion rate of a small globular protein in solution.Figure 5Dependence of recovery time on bleach spot diameter. Results are shown for a series of FRAP experiments performed with three different objective lens magnifications (× 60 (▪), 40 (♦), and 20 (•)) to create a range of initial bleach spot diameters. The estimated characteristic recovery time is plotted against the initial bleach spot radius squared. A linear relationship is observed as expected for a diffusive process. The slope of the fitted line yields a diffusion coefficient estimate of ∼ 3.0 × 10−11 cm2/s. This value is in good agreement with the diffusion coefficient for CBDCex on crystalline cellulose determined using nonlinear regression fitting of Axelrod's series solution to the measured recovery curve.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The dependence of the mobile fraction estimate on the initial bleach spot radius was also examined. Over a range of characteristic recovery times, the contribution to fluorescence recovery of a relatively slow process would become more significant at shorter recovery times. As a consequence, the estimated mobile fraction of molecules would increase as ω decreases. However, in our experiments the mobile fraction of adsorbed CBDs was independent of the initial bleach spot size (data not shown). Therefore, a single characteristic time constant adequately characterizes the observed fluorescence recovery. The second-order dependence of recovery time on bleach spot size and the independence of the mobile fraction on characteristic recovery time strongly support our contention that fluorescence recovery results from surface diffusion of CBDs adsorbed onto microcrystalline cellulose.Surface Diffusion Rate as a Function of Bound CBD Surface Coverage DensityFig. 6 shows diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions regressed from FRAP measurements of CBDCex on V. ventricosa cellulose at various fractions of the maximal surface coverage (Γ/Γmax). Measured binding isotherms for CBDs on the prepared sheets were used to estimate fractional surface coverage densities. The maximal protein loading was 0.4 nmol of CBDCex/cm2 of cellulose. The average sheet thickness was approximately 1.0 μm as determined by imaging several cross-sections using a confocal microscope. Each sheet therefore represents a total cellulose volume of approximately 1.2 × 10−5 cm3 of cellulose, or approximately 147 μg of cellulose/cm2 of cellulose sheet based on a crystalline cellulose density of 1.5 g/cm3. These results give a binding capacity of 5.5 μmol of CBD/g of Valonia cellulose. This capacity agrees well with values from isotherms prepared using disrupted cellulose sheets, indicating that most of the surface of the undisrupted sheet is available for binding.Figure 6Surface diffusion rate as a function of bound CBD concentration. A, the measured diffusion coefficient is presented as a function of the maximal surface coverage Γ/Γmax. Points are means of 12 individual spot FRAP analysis; error bars show ±1 S.E.

Points are means of 12 individual spot FRAP analysis; error bars show ±1 S.E. At low surface coverages, the mobile fraction is approximately 60%. As the surface coverage density increases, the mobile fraction increases to a maximum of about 80%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The diffusion rate of CBDCex increases with surface coverage up to a Γ/Γmax of ∼0.9, after which the estimated diffusion rate decreases as the surface becomes saturated (Fig. 6 A). At low surface coverages, the diffusion rate is about 3.0 × 10−11 cm2/s, increasing to a maximum of about 1.2 × 10−10 cm2/s at Γ/Γmax of ∼0.9. The mobile fraction of CBDCex also increases slightly as a function of Γ/Γmax (Fig. 6 B). At low surface coverages, the mobile fraction is approximately 60%. At high surface coverage density, the mobile fraction reaches a maximum of about 85%.Surface Diffusion Rates for Different Cellulose-binding ProteinsTable II presents recovery results for two different C. fimi cellulases and their respective CBDs at 60% surface coverage. The exoglycanase Cex has little activity on crystalline cellulose (11Gilkes N.R. Jervis E. Henrissat B. Tekant B. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A.J. Kilburn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6743-6749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); hence, enzymatic modification of the cellulose surface during the course of diffusion experiments was not a concern. The endoglucanase CenA is moderately active on crystalline cellulose. A catalytically inactive mutant of CenA was therefore used to prevent surface degradation (10Damude H.G. Withers S.G Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2220-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This mutant binds substrate with wild-type affinity but is unable to cleave substrate because the acid catalyst Asp-252 is mutated to alanine. Diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions are presented for equivalent molar concentrations of protein. In both cases, the whole enzyme has a significantly higher diffusion rate than the isolated binding domain, with Cex having a higher diffusion rate than CenA. The mobile fraction of CenA is about 85% compared with 65% for Cex. The mobile fractions appear to be a function of the CBD domain and do not depend upon whether the domain is isolated or part of the enzyme.Table IISurface diffusion rates for two different CBD-containing enzymesMoleculeDiffusion coefficientMobile fractionCenA2.9 ± 0.5 (10−11)0.85 ± 0.07CenA CBD1.9 ± 0.4 (10−11)0.89 ± 0.07Cex4.1 ± 0.5 (10−11)0.65 ± 0.05Cex CBD3.1 ± 0.4 (10−11)0.65 ± 0.06Shown are the diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions for Cex and its isolated binding domain and a catalytically inactive mutant of CenA and its isolated binding domain.

The mobile fraction of CenA was found to be about 85% compared with 70% for Cex. The mobile fractions appear to be a function of the CBD and do not depend upon whether the molecule is an isolated binding domain or the intact enzyme.

Ser. 1996; 618: 142-163Google Scholar). CBDCex binds irreversibly to crystalline cellulose; dilution of the free CBD at otherwise constant conditions does not result in desorption over time (5Creagh A.L. Ong E. Jervis E.J. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12229-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). How then does the bound enzyme find available substrate when it is distributed across the cellulose surface? Our FRAP results indicate that the irreversibly adsorbed enzyme finds reactive β-1,4-glucopyranoside linkages by diffusing in two dimensions across the cellulose surface. Surface diffusivities of Cex and the inactive mutant of CenA are similar; both diffuse about 30% faster than their respective isolated binding domain.The three-dimensional solution structure of CBDCex has recently been solved by NMR (12Xu G.-Y.

Molecular cloning has demonstrated the presence of multiple related PKC isoforms (6Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar, 8Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem.

The regulatory domain of both classic and novel PKCs has a tandem repeat of zinc finger-like cysteine-rich motifs that confers phospholipid-dependent phorbol ester and DAG binding to these PKC isoforms (10Ono Y.

Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In contrast, atypical PKCs contain a single cysteine-rich motif, do not bind phorbol esters, and are not regulated by DAG (10Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 15Nakanishi H. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24296-24302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recently identified mouse serine protein kinase, named PKD, also consists of regulatory and catalytic domains (18Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). However, comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain of PKD with that of other protein kinases indicates that PKD is a distinct protein kinase that is distantly related to Ca2+-regulated kinases but does not belong to any of the protein kinase subfamilies (19Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Valverde A.M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In particular, the kinase subdomains of PKD show little similarity to the highly conserved regions of the kinase subdomains of the PKC family. Consistent with this, PKD does not phosphorylate a variety of substrates utilized by PKCs, indicating that PKD is a protein kinase with distinct substrate specificity (18Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 20Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of PKD contains a putative transmembrane domain, two cysteine-rich, zinc finger-like motifs, and a pleckstrin homology domain that is not found in any of the PKCs. A fusion protein containing the zinc finger-like domains of PKD-bound [3H]PDB with high affinity (18Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Furthermore, immunopurified PKD was markedly stimulated by PDB or DAG in the presence of phosphatidylserine (20Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A human protein kinase called atypical PKCμ (21Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Johannes F. Prestle J. Dieterich S. Oberhageman P. Link G. Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with 92% homology to PKD (extending to 98% homology in the catalytic domain) is also stimulated by phorbol esters and phospholipids (23Dieterich S. Herget T. Link G. Bottinger H. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These in vitro results indicate that PKD/PKCμ is a novel phorbol ester/DAG-stimulated protein kinase. Recently we reported that exposure of intact cells to biologically active phorbol esters and membrane-permeant DAG induces PKD activation via a PKC-dependent pathway (24Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). PKD activity recovered from phorbol ester-stimulated cells can be measured by kinase assays in the absence of lipid activators (24Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These results revealed an unsuspected connection between PKCs and PKD and implied that PKD can function downstream of PKCs in a novel signal transduction pathway. To assess the physiological significance of this putative pathway, it was important to determine whether growth promoting factors that elevate DAG, and thus activate PKC, also induce PKD activation in intact cells. Quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts have proved to be a useful model system for elucidating signal transduction pathways involved in cell proliferation (4Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), and regulatory peptides of the bombesin family have been identified as potent mitogens for these cells (25Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 26Zachary I. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7616-7620Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Binding of bombesin to its specific seven transmembrane domain receptor activates heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gαq subfamily (27Offermanns S. Heiler E. Spicher K. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Hellmich M. Battey J. Northup J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PDGF, which stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation of phospholipase Cγ1 (reviewed in Ref. 35Exton J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 23: 10-20Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar), leads to a similar sequence of events. The experiments presented here were designed to determine whether bombesin and other growth factors can induce PKD activation in intact cells. Our studies demonstrate that PKD activation is a novel early event in the action of multiple signaling peptides. Stock cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 at 37 °C. For experimental purposes, cells were plated in 90-mm dishes at 6 × 105 cells/dish in DMEM containing 10% FBS and used after 6–8 days, when the cells were confluent and quiescent. COS-7 cells were plated in 90-mm dishes at 9 × 105 cells/dish in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Rat-1 cells and Rat-1 cells stably transfected with the bombesin/GRP receptor (36Charlesworth A. Broad S. Rozengurt E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1337-1345PubMed Google Scholar) were subcultured in 90-mm dishes at 3 × 105 cells/dish with DMEM containing 5% FBS until they became 50–70% confluent (2–3 days) and then switched down to 0.5% FBS for 3–4 days until they were quiescent. Porcine aortic endothelial cells stably transfected with PDGF-β receptors were maintained and propagated in Ham's F-12 medium (37Rankin S. Hooshmand-Rad R. Claesson-Welsh L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7829-7834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved by incubation in Ham's F-12 medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 12 h. The PKD cDNA fragment spanning bases −125 to 3179 was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3, as described (20Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A kinase-deficient mutant (PKDK618M) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis kit (Promega) and subcloned into pcDNA3 (pcDNA3-PKDK618M). Exponentially growing COS-7 cells, 40–60% confluent, were transfected with the various plasmids using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, 12 μg of DNA were used for 90-mm dishes. The DNA was diluted to 100 μl with Opti-MEM I medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then mixed with Lipofectin (36 μl) diluted to 100 μl with Opti-MEM I medium. After 15 min, the DNA-Lipofectin complex was diluted to 10 ml with Opti-MEM I medium, mixed gently, and overlaid onto rinsed (1 × with Opti-MEM I) COS-7 cells. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h, and the medium was then replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were used for experimental purposes 72 h later. In the co-transfection experiments, 6 μg of pcDNA3-PKD or pcDNA3-PKDK618M and 6 μg of BNR-pCD2 containing the cDNA encoding the bombesin/GRP receptor (38Battey J.F. Way J.M. Corjay M.H. Shapira H. Kusano K. Harkins R. Wu J.M. Slattery T. Mann E. Feldman R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) as indicated were mixed prior to dilution with Opti-MEM I medium. Cultured cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 1% Triton X-100 (lysis buffer A). PKD was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2 h with the PA-1 anti-peptide antiserum (1:50 dilution). PA-1 antiserum was raised against the synthetic peptide EEREMKALSERVSIL that corresponds to the COOH-terminal region of the predicted amino acid sequence of PKD as described previously (20Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The immune complexes were recovered using protein A coupled to agarose. PKD autophosphorylation was determined in an in vitro kinase assay by mixing 20 μl of immunocomplexes with 20 μl of a phosphorylation mixture containing (final concentrations) 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 400–600 cpm/pmol), 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (1 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mmNa3V04, 6% SDS, 0.5 m EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and the 110-kDa radioactive band corresponding to autophosphorylated PKD was visualized by autoradiography. Autoradiograms were scanned in an LKB Ultrascan XL densitometer, and the labeled band was quantified using Ultrascan XL internal integrator. Exogenous substrate phosphorylation was assayed using PKD immunoprecipitates and syntide-2 (PLARTLSVAGLPGKK), a peptide based on the phosphorylation site two of glycogen synthase (39Lorca T. Cruzalegui F.H. Fesquest D. Cavadore J.C. Mery J. Heans A. Doree M. Nature. 1993; 366: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 40Mochizuki H. Ito T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9143-9147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes were washed twice with buffer A and twice with a buffer containing 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Syntide-2 (2.5 mg/ml) and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (400–600 cpm/pmol) were then added to the incubation mixture. The final total volume was 30 μl. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C the reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of 75 mmH3PO4 and spotting 75 μl of the reaction mix onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper. Free [γ-32P]ATP was separated from the labeled substrate by washing the P-81 paper four times for 5 min each in 75 mmH3PO4. The papers were dried, and the radioactivity incorporated into syntide-2 was determined by Cerenkov counting. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping on thin layer cellulose plates was performed according to Boyle et al. (41Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent and quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells (1 × 107 cells/condition) were either unstimulated or stimulated with serum-free culture medium containing either 200 nm PDB or 10 nm bombesin for 10 min. Cells were lysed, and PKD was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using PA-1 antiserum according to the procedure described above. PKD immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitrokinase reactions as described above but containing 1 μm[γ-32P]ATP (800–1200 cpm/pmol) in the assay mixture. Autophosphorylated PKD was resolved by SDS-PAGE on 1.5-mm thick, 8% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were briefly fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. The 110-kDa bands corresponding to intact PKD protein were excised from gels and further processed for two-dimensional maps as described (41Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis in pH 1.9 buffer (2.2% formic acid and 7.8% acetic acid in water) was performed for 30 min at a constant current of 21 mA. The solvent system for the ascending chromatography consisted of n-butyl alcohol/pyridine/acetic acid/water in the ratio 75:50:15:60. Thin layer plates were air-dried and subjected to autoradiography to allow visualization of radiolabeled phosphopeptides. Quiescent and confluent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were washed twice in phosphate-free DMEM and incubated at 37 °C with this medium containing 200 μCi/ml carrier-free32Pi for 12 h. Cells were stimulated with different concentrations of bombesin for 10 min. Parallel cultures of32Pi-labeled cells were stimulated with 10 nm bombesin for different times. The cells were subsequently lysed with buffer A, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with PA-1 antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE prior to autoradiography. For Western blot analysis of PKD, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer A and extracted for 10 min at 95 °C in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to Immobilon membranes. The transfer was carried out at 100 V, 0.4 A at 4 °C for 4 h using a Bio-Rad transfer apparatus. The transfer buffer consisted of 200 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, 0.01% SDS, 20% methanol. Membranes were blocked using 5% non-fat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and incubated with PA-1 antiserum (1:500) at room temperature for 4 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% non-fat dried milk. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and subsequent enhanced chemiluminescence detection. [γ-32P]ATP (370 MBq/ml) was from Amersham International (UK). PDB, bombesin, vasopressin, β-endothelin, bradykinin, microcystin, and calyculin A were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (UK). The inhibitors GF I, Ro 31-8220, and R-59 949 were from Calbiochem (UK). Protein A-agarose and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease were from Boehringer Mannheim (U.K.). The MEK-1 inhibitor PD 098059 was the generous gift of Alan R. Saltiel, Department of Signal Transduction, Parke-Davis Research Division, Ann Arbor, MI. The specific bombesin/GRP receptor antagonist [d-F5-Phe6,d-Ala11]bombesin-(6–13)-OMe was the generous gift of David H. Coy, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA. LY294002 was a generous gift from Zeneca, UK. Other items were from standard suppliers or as indicated in the text. To examine whether bombesin induces PKD activation, confluent and quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were exposed to a saturating concentration of this peptide (10 nm) for various periods and lysed. The extracts were immunoprecipitated with the PA-1 antiserum raised against a peptide composed of the 15 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of PKD. The immunocomplexes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to examine the level of autophosphorylation. Stimulation of the cells with bombesin induced a striking increase in PKD activity that was maintained during cell disruption and immunoprecipitation (Fig.1). A marked increase of PKD activity (8-fold) was obtained after 0.5 min and reached a maximum (14-fold over base-line levels) after 1.5 min of bombesin stimulation (Fig.1 A). We also determined whether bombesin-mediated PKD activation could be demonstrated using an exogenous substrate. The synthetic peptide syntide-2 (39Lorca T. Cruzalegui F.H. Fesquest D. Cavadore J.C. Mery J. Heans A. Doree M. Nature. 1993; 366: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 40Mochizuki H. Ito T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9143-9147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been identified as an efficient substrate for the catalytic domain of PKD (18Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and for the full-length PKD (20Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have chosen syntide-2 as a model exogenous substrate to assay PKD activity immunoprecipitated from lysates of Swiss 3T3 cells treated with or without bombesin. As illustrated in Fig. 1 B, bombesin stimulated rapid and robust PKD activation as shown by the syntide-2 phosphorylation assay. These results demonstrate that bombesin stimulation of intact Swiss 3T3 cells induces an activated state of PKD that is maintained during cell lysis and protein isolation. Bombesin induced PKD activation in a concentration-dependent fashion with half-maximal stimulation occurring at 0.5 nm as seen by autophosphorylation and syntide-2 phosphorylation assays (Fig.2 A). The bombesin/GRP receptor antagonist [d-F5-Phe6,d-Ala11]bombesin-(6–13)-OMe (42Coy D. Mungan Z. Rossowski W. Cheng B. Lin J.T. Mrozinski J. Jensen R. Peptides ( Elmsford ). 1992; 13: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) prevented the increase in PKD activity induced by bombesin but did not interfere with the activation of PKD promoted by PDB in parallel cultures (Fig. 2 B). We determined whether the phosphopeptide maps of PKD autophosphorylation obtained from cells stimulated either with bombesin or with PDB were similar. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping of PKD activated in response to either bombesin or PDB showed identical patterns of phosphopeptide fragments (Fig.3).Figure 3Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps of PKD autophosphorylated in vitro and immunoprecipitated from cells stimulated with bombesin or PDB. Confluent and quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells (107 cells/condition) were either left unstimulated or stimulated for 10 min with either 200 nm PDB or 10 nm bombesin as indicated, followed by two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping on thin layer plates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The directions of electrophoresis at pH 1.9 (i.e. toward the cathode) and ascending thin layer chromatography (TLC) are indicated byarrows to the lower left of the figure. Sample origins are indicated by small filled squares. Phosphopeptide patterns observed after autoradiography are shown. Approximately six prominent 32P-labeled tryptic peptidespots were found to be reproducibly induced by either phorbol ester (PDB) or bombesin (Bom) treatments. Interestingly, at least two of these prominent spots also appeared on maps generated from unstimulated cells upon long term exposure of films to thin layer plates. Approximately 1000 cpm were spotted to control plates, and approximately 5000 cpm to plates were used for maps of PKD activated within cells by PDB or bombesin treatments. The control autoradiogram shown was exposed to the thin layer plate for 6 days, and the PDB- or bombesin-stimulated autoradiograms were exposed to the respective thin layer plates for 2 days. Results shown are typical of four similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As bombesin activates PKD in Swiss 3T3 cells, we also examined whether bombesin stimulates PKD activation in other cell types. As shown in Fig.4, bombesin stimulated a rapid and concentration-dependent activation of PKD in Rat-1 cells stably transfected with the bombesin/GRP receptor (36Charlesworth A. Broad S. Rozengurt E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1337-1345PubMed Google Scholar). Half-maximal activation occurred at 0.5 nm. The antagonist [d-F5-Phe6,d-Ala11]bombesin-(6–13)-OMe also prevented PKD activation induced by bombesin in these cells. To confirm that the kinase activity induced by bombesin was due to activation of PKD rather than to the presence of a co-precipitating protein kinase, we examined bombesin-induced PKD autophosphorylation and syntide-2 phosphorylation in COS-7 cells co-transfected with a bombesin/GRP receptor construct (BNR-pCD2) and with either a wild-type PKD expression vector (pcDNA3-PKD) or a kinase-defective PKD mutant (pcDNA3-PKDK618 m) in which lysine 618 in the ATP-binding site is substituted by a methionine. Bombesin treatment of COS-7 cells, co-transfected with pcDNA3-PKD and BNR-pCD2, resulted in activation of wild-type PKD (Fig. 5). In contrast, no inducible kinase activity was seen in COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3K618M despite similar PKD and PKDK618M expression levels (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that the bombesin-induced kinase activity measured in PKD immunoprecipitates was due to the activation of PKD. Peptide mapping with S. aureus V8 protease of PKD labeled with 32Pi in COS-7 cells either transfected with a wild-type PKD expression construct and stimulated with PDB or co-transfected with the wild-type PKD expression construct and the bombesin/GRP receptor expression construct and stimulated with bombesin showed identical phosphopeptide fragments (results not shown). The preceding experiments demonstrated that treatment with bombesin markedly increased the level of PKD autophosphorylation inin vitro kinase assays. We next examined whether bombesin induces PKD phosphorylation in intact cells. Confluent and quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells metabolically labeled with32Pi were stimulated with different concentrations of bombesin for 10 min or with 10 nmbombesin for different times. Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with PA-1 antiserum, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 6 (upper panel), bombesin induced PKD phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner with half-maximal phosphorylation occurring at 0.6 nm. Stimulation of the cells with bombesin induced a 2-fold increase (over base-line levels) in the incorporation of 32Pi after 1 min and reached a maximum (3.5-fold over base-line levels) after 2 min of bombesin stimulation (Fig. 6). Recent results indicated that phorbol e"
https://openalex.org/W2027233092,"The synthesis of essential 7α-hydroxylated bile acids in the liver is mediated by two pathways that involve distinct 7α-hydroxylases. One pathway is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, a well studied cytochrome P450 enzyme. A second pathway is initiated by a less well defined oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase. Here, we show that a mouse hepatic oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase is encoded by Cyp7b1, a cytochrome P450 cDNA originally isolated from the hippocampus. Expression of a Cyp7b1 cDNA in cultured cells produces an enzyme with the same biochemical and pharmacological properties as those of the hepatic oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase. Cyp7b1 mRNA and protein are induced in the third week of life commensurate with an increase in hepatic oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activity. In the adult mouse, dietary cholesterol or colestipol induce cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA levels but do not affect oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity, mRNA, or protein levels. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA is reduced to undetectable levels in response to bile acids, whereas expression of oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase is modestly decreased. The liver thus maintains the capacity to synthesize 7α-hydroxylated bile acids regardless of dietary composition, underscoring the central role of 7α-hydroxylated bile acids in lipid metabolism. The synthesis of essential 7α-hydroxylated bile acids in the liver is mediated by two pathways that involve distinct 7α-hydroxylases. One pathway is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, a well studied cytochrome P450 enzyme. A second pathway is initiated by a less well defined oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase. Here, we show that a mouse hepatic oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase is encoded by Cyp7b1, a cytochrome P450 cDNA originally isolated from the hippocampus. Expression of a Cyp7b1 cDNA in cultured cells produces an enzyme with the same biochemical and pharmacological properties as those of the hepatic oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase. Cyp7b1 mRNA and protein are induced in the third week of life commensurate with an increase in hepatic oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activity. In the adult mouse, dietary cholesterol or colestipol induce cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA levels but do not affect oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity, mRNA, or protein levels. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA is reduced to undetectable levels in response to bile acids, whereas expression of oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase is modestly decreased. The liver thus maintains the capacity to synthesize 7α-hydroxylated bile acids regardless of dietary composition, underscoring the central role of 7α-hydroxylated bile acids in lipid metabolism. The formation of bile acids from cholesterol 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: cholesterol, 5-cholesten-3β-ol; 25-hydroxycholesterol, cholest-5-ene-3β,25-diol; 7α-hydroxylated 25-hydroxycholesterol, cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,25-triol. 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: cholesterol, 5-cholesten-3β-ol; 25-hydroxycholesterol, cholest-5-ene-3β,25-diol; 7α-hydroxylated 25-hydroxycholesterol, cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,25-triol. serves two important physiological functions. First, bile acid biosynthesis provides a pathway of cholesterol catabolism by which excess sterol can be disposed. Second, the end products of this pathway serve as natural detergents in the gut that facilitate the solubilization and absorption of dietary sterols, triglycerides, and fat-soluble vitamins. Individual bile acids differ in the positions of the hydroxyl groups on the ring structure of cholesterol and in the length and degree of oxidation of the side chain. To date, the chemical structures of several hundred bile acids in dozens of different species have been elucidated (1Matschiner J.T. Nair P.P. Kritchevsky D. The Bile Acids, Chemistry, Physiology, and Metabolism. 1. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1971: 11-46Google Scholar). Included in this roster are bile acids that range in size from 19 to 27 carbons and that contain hydroxyl groups with either α or β stereochemistries at one or more of these carbon atoms.Although the chemical structures of bile acids from different species are diverse, almost all vertebrates contain 7α-hydroxylated bile acids (1Matschiner J.T. Nair P.P. Kritchevsky D. The Bile Acids, Chemistry, Physiology, and Metabolism. 1. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1971: 11-46Google Scholar, 2Haslewood G.A.D. J. Lipid. Res. 1967; 8: 535-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that compounds with this substituent play essential roles in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. Two pathways that lead to the synthesis of 7α-hydroxylated bile acids have been described. One is the neutral or microsomal pathway (3Wachtel N. Emerman S. Javitt N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5207-5212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Axelson M. Sjövall J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and involves an initial 7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol by a microsomal cytochrome P450 enzyme termed cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (EC1.14.13.17). This enzyme has been extensively studied at the biochemical, genetic, and molecular levels (reviewed in Refs. 5Russell D.W. Setchell K.D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar and 6Hylemon P.B. Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R. Prog. Liver Dis. 1994; 12: 99-120PubMed Google Scholar). The output from the microsomal pathway is tightly regulated by controlling the transcription of the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene in the liver (7Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Noshiro M. Nishimoto M. Okuda K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 15090-15095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The second pathway is the mitochondrial or acidic pathway and utilizes a slightly different sequence of initial steps in the formation of 7α-hydroxylated bile acids (3Wachtel N. Emerman S. Javitt N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5207-5212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Axelson M. Sjövall J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cholesterol is first converted in mitochondria to an oxysterol by hydroxylation of the side chain (11Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 455-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This intermediate is then a substrate for a microsomal oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase that is distinct from cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (12Axelson M. Shoda J. Sjövall J. Toll A. Wikvall K. J. Biol.

Although oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activity has been reported in several tissues of the pig, rat, hamster, and mouse, a cDNA encoding this enzyme has not yet been reported, nor has the regulation of the enzyme, and hence the output of the mitochondrial pathway, been extensively studied.A genetic demonstration of the physiological importance of 7α-hydroxylated bile acids came from mice in which the contribution of the microsomal pathway was eliminated by targeted disruption of the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene (17Ishibashi S. Schwarz M. Frykman P.K. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18017-18023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Approximately 90% of animals homozygous for a null allele die in the first 3 weeks of life from fat and vitamin malabsorption. Death can be prevented by the addition of a 7α-hydroxylated bile acid and vitamins to the diet, whereas survival in the absence of these supplements is correlated with the induction of the oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase/mitochondrial pathway (16Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D.R. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E. Björkhem I. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18017-18023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The activation of this pathway in mice normally occurs at about 3 weeks of age in response to yet undefined regulatory signals (16Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D.R. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E. Björkhem I. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18024-18031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).A candidate cDNA for the oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase was recently isolated by differential hybridization screening of a hippocampal cDNA library (18Stapleton G. Steel M. Richardson M. Mason J.O. Rose K.A. Morris R.G.M. Lathe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29739-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This cDNA, termed hct-1 forhippocampal transcript 1, encoded a cytochrome P450 enzyme that shared 39% sequence identity with cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. The high degree of sequence conservation placed hct-1 in the cytochrome P450 gene family 7 with the official designation of Cyp7b1 (Ref. 19Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). Besides the hippocampus, thehct-1 mRNA was detected in several nonneuronal tissues, including the liver (18Stapleton G. Steel M. Richardson M. Mason J.O. Rose K.A. Morris R.G.M. Lathe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29739-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Subsequent expression studies showed that thehct-1 enzyme is a steroid 7α-hydroxylase that acts on dehydroepiandrosterone and pregnenolone (20Rose K.A. Stapleton G. Dott K. Kieny M.P. Best R. Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Björkhem I. Seckl J. Lathe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These results, together with the expression of hct-1 in the brain, suggested that the enzyme was involved in the synthesis of neurosteroids (20Rose K.A. Stapleton G. Dott K. Kieny M.P. Best R. Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Björkhem I. Seckl J. Lathe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).In the current study, we provide evidence that hct-1 is also an oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase that participates in hepatic bile acid biosynthesis. The biochemical, pharmacological, and ontological properties of the hct-1 cDNA-encoded enzyme match those of an oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activity present in liver microsomes. It is further shown that the oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase and the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase enzymes, and hence their respective pathways, are differentially regulated in response to diet.RESULTSTo determine if a Cyp7b1 cDNA encoded an oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activity, a murine cDNA was inserted into an expression vector, and the resulting plasmid was transfected into cultured human embryonic kidney 293 cells. A substrate for the murine oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase, 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol (16Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D.R. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E. Björkhem I. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18024-18031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), was then added to the cell media at a final concentration of 0.12 μm. The conversion of this compound into [3H]cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,25-triol (7α-hydroxylated 25-hydroxycholesterol) was monitored by thin layer chromatography. In initial experiments, the presence of an endogenous human oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activity in 293 cells prevented an unambiguous demonstration of plasmid-encoded enzyme activity (data not shown). To overcome this problem, an inhibitor (nafimidone) of cytochrome P450 enzymes 2D. C. Swinney, personal communication. was used to selectively block the human oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase in the 293 cells. The concentration of nafimidone required to inhibit 50% of endogenous oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity in intact 293 cells was approximately 3 μm, whereas concentrations above 500 μm were required to inhibit activity expressed from a transfected murine Cyp7b1 cDNA (data not shown).In the presence of 50 μm nafimidone, mock-transfected cells did not metabolize 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol to more polar compounds during the 8-h course of the experiment (Fig.1, lanes 1–4). Cells transfected with the murine Cyp7b1 expression vector began producing a product identified as 7α-hydroxylated 25-hydroxycholesterol within 30 min of incubation with substrate (lane 5). With longer incubation times, the amount of this product increased, and another metabolite identified as [3H]7α,25-dihydroxy-cholest-4-ene-3-one (Fig. 1,lanes 6–8) appeared; this secondary metabolite arises due to an endogenous 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme activity present in the 293 cells. The chemical structures of these products were previously determined by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry using authentic standards (16Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D.R. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E. Björkhem I. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18024-18031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We concluded from these experiments that the murine Cyp7b1 cDNA encodes an oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase active against 25-hydroxycholesterol.When the transfection experiments with the murine Cyp7b1 cDNA were carried out in the absence of nafimidone, additional cDNA-specific, polar products arising from 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol were detected (Fig. 2). Within 2 h, a major product with a mobility slower than 7α-hydroxylated 25-hydroxycholesterol was detected (lane 2). With longer incubation times, the amount of this metabolite rose and several additional minor products appeared (lanes 3 and4). Mock-transfected cells produced only low levels of 7α-hydroxylated 25-hydroxycholesterol (data not shown). To obtain sufficient mass to determine the chemical structure of the initial metabolite produced in transfected cells, the number of dishes in the experiment was increased by a factor of 30. After an 8-h incubation with 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol, the sterol products were separated by preparative thin layer chromatography, and the compound of interest was isolated from the silica gel plate by extraction with organic solvents.Figure 2Formation of additional oxysterols in cells transfected with Cyp7b1 cDNA. Dishes of cultured 293 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid containing the mouse Cyp7b1 cDNA. After a 24-h expression period, 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol (0.04 μm) was added to the culture media, and the incubations were continued for the indicated times. Thereafter, sterols were extracted from the cell media and analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The locations and identities of several of the sterol products are shown to the right of theautoradiogram. Asterisks mark minor products whose identities were not determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Gas chromatography of the isolated compound revealed a single peak indicative of a high degree of purity (Fig.3 A). The mass spectrum of this compound is shown in Fig. 3 B. A prominent peak atm/z 632 corresponded to the M-90 peak of a tetrahydroxylated cholesterol species. The m/z131 ion was characteristic of metabolites with hydroxylation at carbon 25, while the ion at m/z 251 indicated the presence of one double bond and three hydroxyl groups on the steroid nucleus. Finally, the m/z 129 ion was characteristic of a fragment containing the Δ5,6-unsaturated bond and the 3β-hydroxyl group on carbon 3. The positions of three of the four hydroxyl groups in the metabolite could thus be assigned to carbons 3, 7, and 25 based on previous analyses of Cyp7b1-generated products and on the known structure of the starting substrate.Figure 3Chemical analyses of oxysterol formed in cells transfected with murine Cyp7b1 cDNA. The most abundant side product arising in Cyp7b1-transfected cells (see Fig. 2) was isolated by preparative thin layer chromatography or high pressure liquid chromatography and subjected to gas chromatography and electron ionizing mass spectrometry to deduce a proposed structure for the compound.

An acetonide was produced at high efficiency (data not shown), which was indicative of vicinal hydroxylation at either carbons 2 and 3 or carbons 3 and 4. Position 4 was ruled out by the absence of prominent ions at m/z 147 or 181 in the mass spectrum (Fig. 3 B; Ref. 22Dumaswala R. Setchell K.D. Zimmer-Nechemias L. Iida T. Goto J. Nambara T. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which left carbon 2 as the recipient of the additional hydroxyl group. The configuration of the hydroxyl group at this carbon was not determined. Taken together, these data indicated that the identity of the novel polar product arising from cells transfected with the Cyp7b1 cDNA was cholest-5-ene-2,3β,7α,25-tetrol (Fig. 3 C). Cyp7b1 was thus both an oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase and a 2-hydroxylase.The transfection studies were consistent with the notion that the enzyme encoded by the Cyp7b1 cDNA was an oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase of bile acid biosynthesis. To gain further support for this hypothesis, we exploited the ability of nafimidone to block oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activity. The concentration of nafimidone required to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity in mouse microsomes (the IC50 value) was approximately ∼14 μm (Fig.4). To determine if the oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity encoded by the mouse Cyp7b1 cDNA showed the same inhibition profile, microsomes prepared from transfected 293 cells were assayed for nafimidone sensitivity. The inhibition curve generated with the transfected cell membranes was indistinguishable from that produced with liver microsomes (Fig. 4). The IC50 value for the recombinant enzyme was ∼17 μm. The concentrations of nafimidone required to achieve similar inhibition in intact cells were far greater (see above), suggesting that nafimidone crosses the cell membrane poorly. The similarity in nafimidone inhibition profiles obtained with hepatic and transfected cell membranes supported the idea that the Cyp7b1 cDNA encoded a hepatic oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity in mice.Figure 4Nafimidone inhibition of oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activity in microsomes and transfected cells.Microsomal membranes were prepared from mouse liver or human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with an expression vector containing the murine Cyp7bl cDNA. Aliquots (100 μg of protein) were incubated with 0.2 μm 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol, 1.5 mm NADPH, and nafimidone as indicated. Incubation times were 10 min (liver membranes) or 30 min (transfected cell membranes), both at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by extraction with organic solvents, sterols were separated by thin layer chromatography, and the amounts of substrate and product were determined by phosphor imaging. The reasons why low concentrations of inhibitor increased the level of enzyme activity in both preparations of microsomes were not determined, but they may be related to the inhibition of other cytochrome P450 enzymes in the membranes that deplete the effective concentrations of cofactor or that produce endogenous inhibitors of the reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity is absent or low in the livers of young mice and is induced around the time of weaning (16Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D.R. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E. Björkhem I. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18024-18031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). If the murine Cyp7b1 gene encodes the oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase of bile acid biosynthesis, then the expression of Cyp7b1 mRNA and protein should closely follow the developmental induction of enzyme activity. To test this idea, livers were isolated from mice ranging in age from 5 to 55 days. Three to 10 animals per time point were used. Poly(A)+-enriched mRNA and microsomal membranes were prepared from pooled samples. RNA blotting was performed using a radiolabeled Cyp7b1 cDNA probe. Oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activity in the microsomal membranes was assayed with 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol as substrate, and immunoblotting was performed using a polyclonal antipeptide antibody.As shown in Fig. 5, there was a very good correlation between the level of oxysterol enzyme activity (upper panel), and the levels of both the Cyp7b1 mRNA (middle panel) and protein (lower panel). The time course of induction closely paralleled our previous findings (16Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D.R. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E. Björkhem I. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

Hybridization with a control probe (cyclophilin) showed equal amounts of RNA in each lane of the blot, and Ponceau S staining of the immunoblots showed equal amounts of protein in each lane (data not shown).Figure 5Induction of hepatic oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase in mice. Microsomes and poly(A)+-enriched mRNA were prepared from the livers of mice of the indicated ages (3–10 animals/time point) and assayed for oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity and Cyp7b1 mRNA and protein. Upper panel, aliquots of pooled liver microsomes (100 μg of protein) were incubated with 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol (0.072 μm) and NADPH (1.5 mm) for 15 min.

The washed filter was subjected to autoradiography for a period of 18 h. The positions to which size standards migrated to are shown on the left of the autoradiogram. Subsequent hybridization with a cyclophilin cDNA probe showed that each lane contained similar amounts of RNA. Bottom panel, aliquots of liver microsomal proteins (30 μg) were separated on a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and transferred to a PolyScreen membrane (NEN Life Science Products). The membrane was incubated with a polyclonal antibody directed against a 15-amino acid peptide whose sequence was derived from the Cyp7b1 protein predicted from the cDNA. Primary antibody was detected on the membrane by enhanced chemiluminescence. The exposure time was 5 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To compare and contrast the regulation of this enzyme and that of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, mice were placed on diets having well-characterized effects on the regulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. These included normal laboratory diet or diets supplemented with 2% colestipol, 2% cholesterol, 0.5% cholic acid, or 2% cholesterol plus 0.5% cholic acid. After 10 days, livers were isolated from the different groups, pooled, and assayed for both cholesterol and oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA levels as well as oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity and protein levels.As expected from previous work (23Rudling M.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), colestipol-containing diets increased steady state levels of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA (2.8-fold), as did the addition of cholesterol (1.4-fold) (Fig.6 A). Also, as expected, diets containing cholic acid or cholesterol plus cholic acid led to a marked suppression of the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA (Fig.6 A). In contrast, dietary supplementation with either colestipol or cholesterol had little or no effect on oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA levels (Fig. 6 A) or on enzyme activity or protein levels (Fig. 6 B), whereas the addition of cholic acid or cholesterol plus cholic acid decreased the amount of oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA activity and protein levels by 40–70% (Fig. 6, A and B). Under these experimental conditions, oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA, protein, and activity closely paralleled one another.Figure 6Effect of diet on hepatic oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase expression.

To determine the extent to which this enzyme activity, and hence the mitochondrial pathway leading to 7α-hydroxylated bile acids, was present in other vertebrates, liver microsomal membranes isolated from 14 different species were assayed for their ability to convert 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol into [3H]7α-hydroxylated 25-hydroxycholesterol (Fig.7).

https://openalex.org/W2034929403,"Previous studies indicated that partial agonists cause less desensitization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (βAR) than full agonists; however, the molecular basis for this in intact cells has not been investigated. In the present work, we have determined the rates of desensitization, internalization, and phosphorylation caused by a series of βAR agonists displaying a 95-fold range of coupling efficiencies. These studies were performed with HEK-293 cells overexpressing the βAR with hemagglutinin and 6-histidine epitopes introduced into the N and C termini, respectively. This modified βAR behaved identically to the wild type receptor with regard to agonistK d, coupling efficiency, and desensitization. The coupling efficiencies for βAR agonist activation of adenylyl cyclase relative to epinephrine (100%) were 42% for fenoterol, 4.9% for albuterol, 2.5% for dobutamine, and 1.1% for ephedrine. At concentrations of these agonists yielding >90% receptor occupancy, the rate and extent (0–30 min) of agonist-induced desensitization of βAR activation of adenylyl cyclase followed the same order as coupling efficiency, i.e. epinephrine ≥ fenoterol > albuterol > dobutamine > ephedrine. The rate of internalization of the βAR with respect to these agonists also followed the same order as the desensitization and exhibited a slight lag. Like internalization and desensitization, βAR phosphorylation exhibited a dependence on agonist strength. The two strongest agonists, epinephrine and fenoterol, provoked 11–13-fold increases in the level of βAR phosphorylation after just 1 min, whereas the weak agonists dobutamine and ephedrine caused only 3–4-fold increases, similar to levels induced by cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation with forskolin. With longer treatment times, the level of βAR phosphorylation declined with strong agonists, but it progressively increased with the weaker partial agonists, such that after 30 min the -fold elevation with epinephrine (6.2 ± 0.82) was not appreciably different from ephedrine (5.0 ± 0.96) and significantly less than that caused by albuterol (10.4 ± 1.7). In summary, our results demonstrate an excellent proportionality between the agonist strength and agonist-induced desensitization, internalization, and the rapid initial phase of phosphorylation. The data support the hypothesis that increasing agonist-coupling efficiency primarily affects desensitization by increasing the rate of βARK phosphorylation of the βAR. Previous studies indicated that partial agonists cause less desensitization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (βAR) than full agonists; however, the molecular basis for this in intact cells has not been investigated. In the present work, we have determined the rates of desensitization, internalization, and phosphorylation caused by a series of βAR agonists displaying a 95-fold range of coupling efficiencies. These studies were performed with HEK-293 cells overexpressing the βAR with hemagglutinin and 6-histidine epitopes introduced into the N and C termini, respectively. This modified βAR behaved identically to the wild type receptor with regard to agonistK d, coupling efficiency, and desensitization.

Desensitization is functionally defined as an attenuation of hormonal responsiveness upon agonist stimulation. There are four currently known mechanisms of agonist-induced desensitization that appear to have physiological significance: receptor sequestration/internalization (1Perkins J.P. Hausdorff W.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Perkins J., P. The β-Adrenergic Receptors. The Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1991: 73-124Google Scholar), βAR kinase (βARK) phosphorylation of serines and threonines on the βAR C terminus (3Palczewski K. Benovic J.L. Trends Biol. Sci. 1990; 16: 387-392Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 5Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation of βAR serine 261 or 262 (6Yuan N. Friedman J. Whaley B.S. Clark R.B. J.

Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 343-348PubMed Google Scholar), and down-regulation of the βAR (1Perkins J.P. Hausdorff W.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Perkins J., P. The β-Adrenergic Receptors. The Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1991: 73-124Google Scholar). Two key factors governing which of these mechanisms predominate are the concentration of agonist and the time of exposure to agonist. Short term exposure to low concentrations of agonist in several different cell lines causes a PKA-mediated desensitization that exhibits a t½ of 1–3 min (9Clark R.B. Kunkel M.W. Friedman J. Goka T.J. Johnson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1442-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation, which does not contribute to rapid desensitization, also occurs in response to low concentrations of agonist (11Proll M.A. Clark R.B. Goka T.J. Barber R. Butcher R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 116-122PubMed Google Scholar); however, the t½ is on the order of 50–100 times greater than for the rapid events. In response to high concentrations of full agonists that result in high receptor occupancy, the βAR is rapidly desensitized through βARK-mediated phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding, phosphorylation by PKA, and internalization (1Perkins J.P. Hausdorff W.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Perkins J., P. The β-Adrenergic Receptors. The Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1991: 73-124Google Scholar, 3Palczewski K. Benovic J.L. Trends Biol.

Along with these factors that influence the pathways of desensitization, several preliminary studies have indicated that partial βAR agonists may cause less desensitization in intact cells than full agonists. Su et al. (12Su Y.-F. Harden T.K. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7410-7419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the partial agonists zinterol and soterenol caused a small reduction in βAR desensitization relative to isoproterenol in astrocytoma cells. However, this study did not address which mechanism(s) mediating desensitization were affected. We found that the partial agonist salmeterol had a reduced capacity to desensitize the βAR (13Clark R.B. Allal C. Friedman J. Johnson M. Barber R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 182-189PubMed Google Scholar) and that the partial agonist albuterol caused significantly less internalization than the full agonist epinephrine (14Morrison K.J. Moore R.H. Carsrud N.D.V. Trial J. Millman E.E. Tuvim M. Clark R.B. Barber R. Dickey B.F. Knoll B.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 692-699PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, it appears that while partial βAR agonists may cause less desensitization, little has been accomplished in terms of defining the desensitization mechanisms altered following treatment of intact cells with partial agonists and in quantitating intact cell desensitization, internalization, and phosphorylation. Further, no attempt has been made to correlate a quantitative measure of the coupling efficiency of partial agonists with these parameters (7Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L. Clark R.B. Barber R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we have investigated the desensitization, internalization, and phosphorylation of a double epitope-modified human βAR expressed in HEK-293 cells in response to a series of partial agonists and compared these parameters to the full agonist epinephrine. The agonists we selected provide a 95-fold range of agonist coupling efficiencies. We have found that there is a strong correlation between the coupling efficiencies of agonists and their ability to induce desensitization, internalization, and initial rates of phosphorylation of the βAR. Based on these data, we propose that the reduced desensitization observed with partial agonists results from a decrease in the rate of βARK-mediated phosphorylation and internalization. ATP, alprenolol, β-mercaptoethanol, poly-l-lysine, andN,N′,N′′-triacetylchitotriose (TACT) were obtained from Sigma. [α-32P]ATP and [32P]H3PO4 were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. β-Agonists included (−)-epinephrine bitartrate, albuterol hemisulfate, dobutamine hydrochloride, and ephedrine hydrochloride obtained from Research Biochemicals International (RBI). GTP was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was obtained from Qiagen. Wheat germ agglutinin-agarose was obtained from Vector Laboratories.n-Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was obtained from Calbiochem. All electrophoresis reagents and standards were obtained from Bio-Rad. [125I]Iodocyanopindolol (125ICYP) was prepared as described previously (16Barovsky K. Brooker G. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1980; 6: 297-307PubMed Google Scholar) and modified by Hoyer et al. (17Hoyer D.E. Reynolds E. Molinoff P.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type human βAR cDNA, generously provided by Dr. Robert Lefkowitz (Duke), and a human βAR cDNA, modified by placement of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope between the second and third amino acids on the N terminus, kindly provided by Dr. Brian Kobilka (Stanford), were cloned into the expression vector pBC12B1 (18von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We introduced six histidine residues, followed by a stop codon, into the C terminus just after the last two amino acids (Leu-Leu) of the HA-modified βAR cDNA to construct the βAR that was transfected into HEK cells. The 6-His modification was introduced by the polymerase chain reaction method, and the receptor was sequenced to check for errors in the polymerase chain reaction and verify the alterations. We have determined that the HA and 6-His epitope tags do not significantly modify the ability of this βAR to bind ligand, couple to Gs and activate adenylyl cyclase, or desensitize when exposed to β-agonist (data not shown). HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The expression vector pBC12B1 containing either the HA- and 6-His-modified receptor (HA6His) or the wild type receptor (wild type βAR) was transfected into HEK-293 cells, along with the neomycin-expressing plasmid, pSV2neo, by calcium phosphate co-precipitation in a mass ratio of 100:1. Cells were shocked the next day with 25% glycerol for 1 min, and the following day were split into 96-well dishes into selection media, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and Geneticin at 400 μg/ml. Stable transformants expressing receptor were identified using an intact cell [3H]CGP-12177 binding assay, described below, and cloned by limiting dilution. Several HA6His and wild type βAR clones were isolated, and one of these HA6His clones expressing 2–3 pmol of βAR, was selected for the experiments performed herein. For desensitization experiments, preconfluent HA6His cells in 150-mm dishes were pretreated with various agents or appropriate control buffers in growth medium, and incubated for 0.5–30 min at 37 °C, as described in the figure legends. To prevent oxidation, all βAR agonists were dissolved in aqueous solution containing final concentrations of 0.1 mmascorbate and 1 mm thiourea (AT). Membranes were prepared as described previously (7Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L. Clark R.B. Barber R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar) except that after pretreatment cells were washed six times with ice cold HME buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Adenylyl cyclase activity in the membrane preparations was measured as described previously (7Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L. Clark R.B. Barber R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar) with the free Mg2+ concentration set at 0.3 mm. The final concentration of ATP in the assay was 0.1 mm. All incubations were performed at 30 °C. GraphPad software was used to perform dose response curve fitting and to determine EC50and V max values. Surface levels of the βAR were determined by the following procedure. HA6His cells were plated onto 35-mm dishes coated with 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine. Cells were pretreated with agonist or AT, in triplicate, at 37 °C for 0.5–30 min. Following incubation with agonist, the medium was removed and cells were washed six times with 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). 1.25 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing hydrophilic antagonist [3H]CGP-12177 at a concentration of 5 nm was added to each plate and incubated for 1 h on ice, which we determined was sufficient for maximum radioligand binding. Nonspecific binding was measured by the addition of 1 μm alprenolol to the [3H]CGP-12177. Radioligand binding was terminated by three washes with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS. The cells were removed by the addition of 750 μl of 0.25% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA, PBS. [3H]CGP binding was quantitated by scintillation counting. To determine the amount of βAR expressed on the cell surface under control conditions, [3H]CGP binding was performed in the presence and absence of 0.2% digitonin (19Slowiejko D.M. Levey A., I. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This method was also used to measure total receptor levels after agonist pretreatment. The K d value for agonist binding to the βAR was determined by displacement of 20–40 pm125ICYP in the presence of 10 μm GTP in membranes (6Yuan N. Friedman J. Whaley B.S. Clark R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23032-23038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L. Clark R.B. Barber R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was assessed by inclusion of 1 μm alprenolol, and data analysis was performed using GraphPad software. TheK d for all of the agonists was identical (within the limits of experimental error, ±30%) for cells overexpressing either the wild type or HA6His βAR in the parental HEK- 293 cells (data not shown). Receptor number (B max) and the K d for hydrophobic antagonist 125ICYP were determined by Scatchard analysis of 125ICYP binding to membranes as described previously (6Yuan N. Friedman J. Whaley B.S. Clark R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23032-23038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L. Clark R.B. Barber R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The concentration of 125ICYP was varied from 1 to 200 pm, and radioligand was diluted in HE buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) plus 50 mm phentolamine, 0.1 mm ascorbate, and 1 mm thiourea. βAR levels in the parental HEK cell line were 5–10 fmol/mg of membrane protein, and in the HA6His cells they were between 2 and 3 pmol/mg. HA6His cells were grown to confluency in 100-mm dishes coated with 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine. Cells were rinsed three times with 5 ml of phosphate-free buffer (40 mm Hepes, 5.4 mm KCl, 122 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5.4 mm glucose, pH 7.4) followed by labeling with approximately 0.5 mCi of [32P]H3PO4 in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3 h. 32P uptake, monitored by measuring extracellular 32P, reached a maximum by 2 h and averaged 92% by 3 h. Cells were then treated with concentrations of agonists yielding >90% occupancy for varying times. Agonist incubations were stopped by three washes with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then scraped in PBS containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 100 nm okadaic acid, and pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were solubilized by resuspension with a 23-gauge needle in solubilization buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.8%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 20 mmtetrasodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 100 nm okadaic acid, and 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocking apparatus. The solubilized extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The solubilized extracts were subjected to a two-step purification procedure. First, extracts were partially purified by utilizing the βAR C-terminal 6-His extension. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was prepared by one wash with 100 mm NiSO4followed by two washes with nickel column buffer (0.05%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Solubilized extracts were then loaded onto columns containing 250 μl of packed nickel resin, which allowed us to achieve maximum βAR binding to the resin (>90%). Columns were washed with 70 volumes of nickel column buffer containing 5 mm imidazole. Washes were followed by competitive elution of the βAR with a step gradient of imidazole (1.5 ml/fraction), which extended from 10 to 50 mm. Our βAR elution peak fractions extended from 25 to 45 mm imidazole with approximately 80% specific recovery (as determined by 125ICYP binding). Fractions eluted in 35–50 mm imidazole were collected and frozen overnight before proceeding to the next purification step. Further purification was achieved by lectin chromatography using wheat germ agglutinin-agarose that was first prepared by two 10-min washes with nickel column buffer. 100 μl of packed resin was added to the combined 35–50 mm imidazole nickel column fractions and allowed to incubate for 90 min at 4 °C on a rocking apparatus. Wheat germ pellets were then washed three times with 50 volumes of nickel column buffer for 10 min at 4 °C. At this point, aliquots were taken from selected experiments to quantitate receptor level by125ICYP binding. Elution of the βAR was achieved by incubation with 3 mm TACT in 0.5% SDS for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by a second TACT/SDS elution for 30 min at 37 °C. The eluates were combined and mixed with an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 45% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 6 m urea, 143 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated for 15 min at 60 °C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried, and 32P was quantitated by using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager model 860 and ImageQuant software. We were able to convert gel 32P area/volume quantitation by ImageQuant software to cpm by spotting and quantitating a known amount of 32P. Within an individual experiment where independent samples were processed in triplicate the S.E. was minimal. For example, in one experiment, the 32P cpm value for a 5-min treatment with 10 μm epinephrine (n = 3) was 265 ± 8.5. To confirm the identity of the 32P-labeled βAR, after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to 32P quantitation followed by immunoblot analysis as described (15Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbruun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) using a primary rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody from Berkeley Antibody Company (Babco) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Immunoblot and 23P images of the βAR were identical in molecular weight, confirming the identity of the βAR and also demonstrating that total receptor levels did not change with agonist pretreatment. We have verified experimentally that the following equation describes relative coupling efficiency of the agonist stimulation of adenylyl cyclase over a 1000-fold range of βAR expression levels (6Yuan N. Friedman J. Whaley B.S. Clark R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23032-23038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L. Clark R.B. Barber R. Mol.

Because k −1 is a first order rate constant that is independent of receptor and agonist levels, it is assumed to be invariant, and for all calculations it has been set to 1. Therefore, any changes in thek 1/k −1 ratio can be attributed to k 1, and k 1can be defined as coupling efficiency. This equation was used to calculate the coupling efficiencies given in Table I.Table ICoupling efficiencies of βAR agonistAgonistK d (+GTP)EC50V maxCoupling efficiencyCalculatedPercentage of epinephrinenmnmpmol/min/mg%Epinephrine653 ± 1231.7 ± 0.257 ± 4.90.16100Fenoterol126 ± 80.79 ± 0.353 ± 5.10.0742Albuterol528 ± 9928 ± 3.148 ± 4.30.0084.9Dobutamine697 ± 5265 ± 1137 ± 4.60.0042.5Ephedrine2830 ± 466565 ± 10131 ± 3.60.0021.1The EC50 and V max values for the activation of adenylyl cyclase activity in HA6His cells by β-agonists are listed and are the mean ± S.E., n = 3. Membranes were prepared from HA6His cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” HA6His cells expressed 2300 fmol of βAR/mg of membrane protein. The K d values were calculated from agonist displacement of 125ICYP and are the mean of two experiments with the exception of albuterol (n = 6). The EC50 and V maxvalues were determined by dose responses of agonist stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (n = 3). The coupling efficiencies were calculated using Equation 1. Open table in a new tab The EC50 and V max values for the activation of adenylyl cyclase activity in HA6His cells by β-agonists are listed and are the mean ± S.E., n = 3.

The EC50 and V maxvalues were determined by dose responses of agonist stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (n = 3). The coupling efficiencies were calculated using Equation 1. As seen from the equation for coupling efficiency, the ability of an agonist to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activation is dependent on both the coupling efficiency (k 1) and receptor number (r) on the cell surface. The total capacity of the βAR to activate adenylyl cyclase may be expressed ask 1 r, which we define as thecoupling capacity of the agonist-bound βAR at a given receptor density. We have previously shown (7Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L. Clark R.B. Barber R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar) that coupling capacity is defined by the equation (k 1)r= (V max)(K d) /(V 100)(EC50), where V max is the maximum adenylyl cyclase activity observed for saturating concentrations of agonist, andV 100 is the theoretical value representing adenylyl cyclase activity when k 1 is infinite. The change in (k 1)r that occurs as desensitization proceeds can be used as a measure of the extent of desensitization. This is expressed as the ratio of (k 1)r for the desensitized receptor (D) to the naive receptor (N). BecauseV 100 and K d are the same for the desensitized and naive receptor, (k 1 r) D /(k 1 r) N can be expressed in the following form, which we define as thefraction of βAR activity remaining (7Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L. Clark R.B. Barber R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar, 20Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Barber R. Clark R.B. Pharmacol.

This formulation is essentially identical to the empirical equation previously reported by Pippig et al. (21Pippig S. Andexinger S. Daniel K. Puzicha M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. J. Biol.

Values for coupling efficiency give a quantitative measure of the ability of the agonist-bound βAR to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity. The ranges ofK d values, EC50 values,V max values, and coupling efficiencies determined for the agonists used in this study are given in TableI. Our calculations indicate that the coupling efficiency for epinephrine stimulation of the double epitope-modified βAR is 0.16, and this value is identical to that found for the unmodified wild type receptor (data not shown), demonstrating that the double epitope modifications do not alter coupling efficiency. The coupling efficiencies determined for the other agonists relative to epinephrine were 42% for fenoterol, 4.9% for albuterol, 2.5% for dobutamine, and 1.1% for ephedrine. These agonists provided a 95-fold range of coupling efficiencies and were used to determine the relationship of coupling efficiency to agonist-induced desensitization, internalization, and phosphorylation. To determine the rate of desensitization, HA6His cells were pretreated for various times (0–30 min) with a concentration of each agonist that was calculated to give >90% occupancy of the βAR. Following the pretreatments, membranes were prepared, and the dose responses for epinephrine stimulation of adenylyl cyclase were measured. Fig. 2 A shows the result of a typical experiment in which HA6His cells were pretreated with 10 μm epinephrine from 1 to 5 min. The pretreatment caused a progressive increase in"

We use nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells as a model and find a novel signal transduction pathway that blocks cell proliferation. Treatment of PC12 cells with NGF leads to induction of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (Peunova, N., and Enikolopov, G. (1995)Nature 375, 68–73). The resulting nitric oxide (NO) acts as a second messenger, activating the p21WAF1 promoter and inducing expression of p21WAF1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. NO activates the p21WAF1 promoter by p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. Blocking production of NO with an inhibitor of NOS reduces accumulation of p53, activation of the p21WAF1 promoter, expression of neuronal markers, and neurite extension. To determine whether p21WAF1 is required for neurite extension, we prepared a PC12 line with an inducible p21WAF1 expression vector. Blocking NOS with an inhibitor decreases neurite extension, but induction of p21WAF1 with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside restored this response. Levels of p21WAF1 induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were similar to those induced by NGF. Therefore, we have identified a signal transduction pathway that is activated by NGF; proceeds through NOS, p53, and p21WAF1 to block cell proliferation; and is required for neuronal differentiation by PC12 cells.

However, the relationship among these signaling events, arrest, and differentiation is poorly understood. Nitric oxide (NO) is a regulatory molecule that influences many processes, perhaps including neuronal proliferation and differentiation. NO is synthesized from arginine by a family of three NOS proteins: neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS) (8Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar). In mature mammals, NO acts as a neurotransmitter, a regulator of blood pressure, and a toxin for killing pathogens. A role for NO in the developing nervous system is plausible because nNOS is absent from proliferating neuroblasts but is coexpressed with early markers of neuronal differentiation (9Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5147-5159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 301-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). InDrosophila, NOS is expressed in developing imaginal discs (11Kuzin B. Roberts I. Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Cell. 1996; 87: 639-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NOS in larvae results in enhanced cell proliferation, and elevated NOS expression stunts development. In rats, NGF enhances expression of nNOS by cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain (12Holtzman D.M. Lee S. Li Y.W. Chuacouzens J. Xia H.B. Bredt D.S. Mobley W.C. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). NGF treatment of PC12 cells induces expression of all three isoforms of NOS (2Hirsch D.B. Steiner J.P. Dawson T.M. Mammen A. Hayek E. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 749-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 3Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 375: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), and inhibitors of NOS block NGF-induced cessation of proliferation and neurite extension for PC12 cells (3Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 375: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Hence, NO acts as a regulator of cell proliferation which, in turn, influences process outgrowth. The tumor suppressor p53 may play a role in neural development, in addition to its well established function as an inducer of apoptosis or cell cycle arrest after certain types of cell stress, including DNA damage (13Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Mice lacking functional p53 genes have an unusually large number of birth defects, such as failure of neural tube closure (14Armstrong J.F. Kaufman M.H. Harrison D.J. Clarke A.R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 931-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In some mouse embryos, the absence of p53 leads to exencephaly in which overgrowth of neural tissue in the fore- and midbrain leads to abnormalities in cranial development (15Sah V.P. Attardi L.D. Mulligan G.J. Williams B.O. Bronson R.T. Jacks T. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). This overgrowth probably results from excessive cell proliferation rather than decreased cell death. Consistent with this role, a recent study found that p53 is required for NGF-induced neurite extension by PC12 cells (4Eizenberg O. Faber-Elman A. Gottlieb E. Oren M. Rotter V. Schwartz M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5178-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). p21WAF1 binds to and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases and induces cell cycle arrest at G1/S (16El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174PubMed Google Scholar), but expression of p21WAF1 also can be induced by p53-independent mechanisms (18Elbendary A. Berchuck A. Davis P. Havrilesky L. Bast R.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30841-30844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have reported up-regulation of p21WAF1 expression in NGF-treated cell lines. We have demonstrated that p21WAF1 is required for survival of differentiating neuroblastoma cells (5Poluha W. Poluha D.K. Chang B. Crosbie N.E. Schonhoff C.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Ross A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1335-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), but van Grunsvenet al. (6van Grunsven L.A. Billon N. Savatier P. Thomas A. Urdiales J.L. Rudkin B.B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1347-1356PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that after differentiation of PC12 cells, continued expression of p21WAF1 is not required to maintain their differentiated phenotype. Hence, it may be that p21WAF1 plays its most important role during differentiation. In this report, we provide the first evidence for a connection among these NGF-induced events. We find that NO activates the p21WAF1 promoter, resulting in expression of p21WAF1 protein. This link is partially dependent on p53, a potent transcriptional activator for p21WAF1 (16El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7935) Google Scholar). NO also is required for NGF-induced expression of two markers associated with neuronal differentiation. Using a PC12 line bearing an inducible expression vector for p21WAF1, we find that induction of recombinant p21WAF1 restores NGF-induced differentiation for cells treated with a NOS inhibitor. These data demonstrate a signal transduction pathway that is activated by NGF; proceeds through NOS, p53, and p21WAF1 to block cell proliferation; and is required for NGF-induced neuronal differentiation by PC12 cells. PC12 cells from Dr. David Kaplan (Montreal Neurological Institute) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2. These cells were found to be mycoplasma-free by the direct culture method (MYCOTRIM, Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA). For PC12 cell differentiation, plastic dishes were treated overnight at 4 °C with 15 μg/ml rat tail collagen (Sigma) and 15 μg/ml poly-d-lysine (>300,000 Da, Sigma). The dishes were rinsed with distilled water, and then PC12 cells were plated in defined medium, as described (27Reinhold D.S. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3538-3544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and treated with 100 ng/ml NGF (2.5 S, Bioproducts for Science, Indianapolis). After 3–4 days of treatment, cells with neurites at least five cell diameters long were scored as positive. N-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) competes with arginine for binding to all three isoforms of NOS and blocks enzymatic activity (8Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar). In these studies, we used 20 mml-NAME and the same concentration of the inactive enantiomer, d-NAME, as a control. l-NAME used at this concentration is thought to be specific for NOS and with little effect on PC12 metabolism, growth rates, and NGF induction of immediate-early genes (3Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 375: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We prepared a PC12 line bearing an inducible expression vector (LacSwitch, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for p21WAF1. In this system, mammalian cells are transfected with both a Lac-repressor-expressing vector and a lac-operator-containing p21WAF1vector. Expression of p21WAF1 occurs within 48 h after the addition of 25 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). The p21WAF1 plasmid for these experiments was prepared by J. Earheart and R. Pittman (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). In brief, the protein-encoding portion of the p21WAF1 cDNA was inserted into the pOPRSV1 plasmid (Stratagene) which includes a neomycin resistance gene. Expression of p21WAF1 is driven by a Rous sarcoma virus promoter but, in the absence of IPTG, is suppressed by adjoining lac operator sites. Plasmid p3′SS, which has the lac repressor gene under control of a cytomegalovirus early promoter, also was from Stratagene and was used without modification. PC12 cells were transfected with the p3′SS Lac repressor plasmid, using the cationic detergent Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmid DNA (6–7 μg/25-cm2 flask) was diluted in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (serum-free). At the same time in a second tube, 20 μl of 1 mg/ml Lipofectin was diluted with 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the two solutions were combined and incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature. This mix was then diluted with 2.5 ml of complete medium including serum, added to a 25-cm2 tissue culture flask containing about 3 × 106 cells, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The resulting cells were selected for 14 days with medium containing 125 μg/ml hygromycin. This mass culture was derived from about 20 different hygromycin-resistant colonies. These cells were then transfected by the same procedure with the pOPRSV1 p21(WAF1) plasmid bearing the p21WAF1 cDNA and selected for 14 days with 100 μg/ml G418. The mass culture from the second transfection was derived from about 30 different G418-resistant colonies. The morphology and rates of proliferation of these cells were not obviously affected by the transfections. After treatment with NGF and NO drugs, cells were extracted as described (17El-Deiry W.S. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M. Velculescu V.E. Canman C.E. Jackman J. Pietenpol J.A. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Wang Y. Wiman K.G. Mercer W.E. Kastan M.B. Kohn K.W. Elledge S.J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174PubMed Google Scholar). These samples (≈40 μg of protein/lane) were boiled under reducing conditions, subjected to electrophoresis on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, and electrotransferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Residual proteins in the gel were stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm even loading of the gel. The membrane was blocked for 1 h with 10% powdered milk in 0.2% Tween 20, Tris-buffered saline, and then incubated with 2 μg/ml anti-p53 monoclonal antibody Pab-1801 (Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA), 1 μg/ml rabbit anti-p21WAF1 antibody C-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or 35 μg/ml anti-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) monoclonal antibody mab35 (28Tzartos S.J. Rand D.E. Einarson B.L. Lindstrom J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8635-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) and a chemiluminescence reagent (29Matthews J.A. Batki A. Hynds C. Kricka L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The films were scanned with a Hewlett Packard ScanJet 3c. Brightness and contrast were adjusted with Photoshop, making the same adjustments for each band. Montages were assembled with CorelDraw, using only images from the same experiment and film. Cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and immunostained with 1 μg/ml of anti-p21WAF1 rabbit antibody C-19 and then a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. The cells were then incubated with 1.0 mg/ml of NADPH, 0.25 mg/ml of nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.1 m Tris HCl for 4 h at 37 °C (30Mizukawa K. Vincent S.R. McGeer P.L. McGeer E.G. J. Comp.

Samples were mounted in Citifluor (Ted Pella Inc., Reading, PA) and were viewed with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope and a 25× oil immersion objective lens, using bright field and fluorescence optics to detect diaphorase and p21WAF1, respectively. For detection of neuronal markers, cells were fixed for 10 min with 95% methanol, 5% acetic acid at −20 °C. The samples were stained with 35 μg/ml of monoclonal antibody mab35 against the α subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) (28Tzartos S.J. Rand D.E. Einarson B.L. Lindstrom J.M. J.

Both of these markers are expressed during development, although the time of initial onset is earlier for MAP1B (33Tohyama T. Lee V.M.-Y. Rorke L.B. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Comp.

Brightness and contrast were adjusted with Adobe Photoshop, and montages were assembled with CorelDraw. The figures were printed using a Kodak Colorease PS printer on Kodak Extatherm XLS paper. PC12 cells were treated for 60 h with or without NGF, l-NAME, ord-NAME. Then, using Lipofectin as described above, they were cotransfected with promoter constructs WWP-Luc or DM-Luc (16El-Deiry W.S.

After 16–20 h, cells were extracted for 15 min at room temperature with cell culture lysis reagent (Promega; 25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm CDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). These extracts were clarified by centrifugation, stored at −70 °C, and then used immediately after thawing. Mixtures of 20 μl of cell extract and 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (20 mm Tricine, 1.07 mm(MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2·3H2O, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 270 μm coenzyme A, 470 μm luciferin, 530 μm ATP, pH 7.8) were immediately placed in a model N Luminometer analyzer (Packard), and luciferase activities were measured. β-Galactosidase activities were measured using a kit from Promega. Assay 2× buffer (120 mm Na2HPO4, 80 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mmMgCl2, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.33 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) was mixed with an equal volume (100 μl) of cell extract. Samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 1 m Na2CO3. Optical densities at 420 nm were measured. Luciferase activities were normalized with β-galactosidase activities to eliminate any differences in transfection efficiencies. Using NGF-treated PC12 cells as a model system, we tested the relationship among several signaling events that occur during neuronal differentiation. We found that the NOS inhibitor, l-NAME, but not the inactive enantiomer d-NAME, inhibits NGF-induced neurite extension by 73 ± 15% (mean ± S.D.,n = 6), in agreement with Peunova and Enikolopov (3Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 375: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We assayed expression of two markers associated with neuronal differentiation.

For this experiment, untreated PC12 cultures showed 12 ± 1% of cells positive for MAP1B, but NGF-treated cultures showed 87 ± 3% cells positive. l-NAME, but not d-NAME, reduced this NGF-induced increase in MAP1B expression (d-NAME + NGF-treated cells, 88 ± 4% positive; l-NAME + NGF-treated cells, 14 ± 2% positive). Averaging three experiments, l-NAME inhibited NGF induction of MAP1B-positive cells by 85 ± 10%. The pattern of expression for nAChR closely resembled that for MAP1B (36Henderson L.P. Gdovin M.J. Liu C. Gardner P.D. Maue R.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (micrographs not shown). By Western blotting, we observed the same pattern of expression for nAChR (Fig. 2). Averaging three experiments, the relative intensities of the nAChR bands for control, NGF, NGF +d-NAME, NGF + l-NAME, and l-NAME were 1.0, 2.6 ± 0.2, 3.7 ± 1.6, 0.8 ± 0.4, and 0.8 ± 0.3, respectively. The anti-MAP1B antibody does not detect MAP1B protein by Western blotting. Hence, NO, like cell cycle arrest, is required for NGF-induced differentiation.Figure 2NGF-induced expression of nAChR is dependent on NO.

As judged by scanning densitometry, NGF induced accumulation of p53 and p21WAF1 by 7.1 ± 4.3-fold and 4.7 ± 1.1-fold (n = 3), respectively, compared with levels in untreated cells (Fig.3). l-NAME, but notd-NAME, inhibited NGF-induced accumulation of p53 by 87 ± 7% and p21WAF1 by 61 ± 7%. This is the first report that NO, at physiological levels, acts as a second messenger to enhance expression of p53 and p21WAF1, although it was reported that treatment of cells with NO donors induces accumulation of p53 (37Forrester K.

To evaluate further the relationship between NO and p21WAF1expression, we transfected PC12 cells with a p21WAF1promoter-luciferase reporter construct (WWP-Luc (16El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7935) Google Scholar)) and found that treatment with NGF significantly enhanced the activity of the p21WAF1 promoter (p ≤ 0.0001, Student'st test) (Fig. 4). This response was inhibited by l-NAME but not byd-NAME. The parallel regulation of p21WAF1promoter activity and p21WAF1 protein levels (Figs. 3 and4) suggests that NGF increases p21WAF1 levels by an NO-dependent increase in p21WAF1 promoter activity. To determine whether NGF regulates p21WAF1 promoter activity via p53, a potent transcriptional activator of p21WAF1 (16El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7935) Google Scholar), we utilized a truncated promoter lacking the p53 binding site (DM-Luc (16El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E.

Cells transfected with this shorter construct gave substantially reduced responses to NGF (Fig. 4). Therefore, transcriptional activation by p53 is a major mechanism by which NGF induces p21WAF1 expression. However, there was significant activation (p ≤ 0.0001) of the shorter promoter construct, indicating a second mechanism independent of the p53 binding site. We also assessed the relationship between NOS, p21WAF1, and neurite extension for individual cells. We double stained PC12 cells for diaphorase activity and p21WAF1. Diaphorase staining allows visualization of NOS enzymatic activity, resulting in colored cells that can be detected by bright-field light microscopy (45Dawson T.M. Bredt D.S. Fotuhi M. Hwang P.M.

This method is specific for NOS because other diaphorases are inactivated by fixation with paraformaldehyde. p21WAF1 was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy, using an anti-p21WAF1 antibody. For untreated cultures, few PC12 cells displayed diaphorase staining, p21WAF1immunoreactivity, or neurites (Fig. 5,A, C, and E, respectively). NGF treatment increased the percentages of cells with diaphorase activity (92%), p21WAF1 immunoreactivity (85%), and neurites (77%) (Fig. 5, B, D, and E, respectively). The staining for p21WAF1 was almost exclusively nuclear, in agreement with other studies (47Li R. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Curr.

To test the role of p21WAF1 in NGF-induced differentiation, we prepared a PC12 line bearing an inducible p21WAF1expression vector (Fig. 6). This line differentiated in response to NGF, in the same manner as the parental PC12 line, and l-NAME reduced neurite extension (Fig. 6,A, D, and E). However, induction of p21WAF1 expression with I"

The InsP3R-mediated signaling pathway appears to be ubiquitous and is involved in many cellular processes including cell division, smooth muscle contraction, and neuronal signaling. Different regions of the heart also express InsP3 receptors. We report here that acutely dissociated ventricular myocytes from ferret and rat hearts express significant levels of InsP3R as indicated by immunoblotting with a receptor consensus antibody. InsP3binding experiments (K D = 23.6 nm andB max = 0.46 pmol/mg) suggest the myocytes contain the high affinity type 2 InsP3 receptor. Exhaustive mRNA screening by polymerase chain reaction, RNase protection, and subsequent DNA sequencing positively identify the InsP3R as type 2. The type 2 receptor from ferret heart was then incorporated into planar lipid bilayers and formed Ca2+-selective, InsP3-activated, heparin-blocked ion channels. We conclude that the predominant InsP3 receptor isoform expressed in cardiac myocytes is type 2 and that it forms a functional InsP3-gated Ca2+ channel when reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers.

Phospholipase C is activated in response to the stimulation of cell surface receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins and tyrosine kinases resulting in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to liberate InsP3 and diacylglycerol. InsP3 is a readily diffusible compound that binds to specific (InsP3R) receptors localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and results in the release of calcium from intracellular stores (see reviews Refs.1Berridge M.J.

The primary structure of these InsP3Rs has been determined by cDNA cloning and sequencing (4Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K.

When compared with the type 1 receptor, the type 2 and type 3 isoforms have an overall amino acid sequence identity of 69 and 64%, respectively (6Sudhof T.C. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T.

Even though the three principal types of receptor are very similar, they exhibit significantly different affinities for InsP3 binding (designated T-2 > T-1 ≫ T-3), suggesting that the different receptor homologues have distinct functions within a cell (6Sudhof T.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cardiac muscle, the ryanodine receptor serves as the primary calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in excitation-contraction coupling (11Smith J.S. Imagawa T. Ma J. Fill M. Campbell K. Coronado R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 92: 1-26Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 12Gyorke S. Fill M. Science. 1993; 260: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The role of InsP3-induced calcium release in cardiac cells is not well understood. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate turnover coupled to α-adrenergic and muscarinic plasma membrane receptors has been shown to increase InsP3levels in cardiac muscle (13Brown J.H. Jones L.G. Putney J.W. Phosphoinositides and Receptor Mechanisms. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1986: 245-270Google Scholar, 14Scholz H. Bruckner R. Mugge A. Reupcke C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1986; 18: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Initial studies revealed that InsP3 was capable of inducing a slow release of calcium from vesicular preparations as well as activate contraction in skinned ventricular rat muscle and chick heart preparations (15Hirata M. Suematus E. Hashimoto T. Hamachi T. Koga T. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Borgattaet al. (16Borgatta L. Watras J. Katz A.M. Ehrlich B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2486-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) identified a low conductance, InsP3-sensitive, calcium release channel in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicle preparations from canine heart. These channels were concentrated in the sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from the ventricle septum that contains cells of the conducting system. Recently, biochemical and immunological approaches have been applied to identify the InsP3 receptor in cardiac tissues. Moschella and Marks (17Moschella M.C. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) observed InsP3R in rat heart using in situhybridizations and immunocytochemical analysis and concluded that the receptor expressed in cardiac myocytes is structurally similar to the type 1 receptor. The expression level was approximately 50-fold lower than that of the cardiac ryanodine receptor. Gorza et al.(18Gorza L. Schiaffino S. Volpe P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19Gorza L. Vettore S. Volpe P. Sorrentino V. Samuel J.-L. Anger Lompre M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 752: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) observed the highest levels of expression in Purkinje myocytes of the conduction system using type 1 (cerebellar) peptide antibodies and cRNA probes. The InsP3 receptor was localized to the intercalated disc of cardiac myocytes using immunogold electron microscopy (20Kijima Y. Saito A. Jetton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3499-3506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggested that the receptor may be involved in cell-cell signaling or potentially calcium influx. The biological role of this receptor family in cardiac tissues is unclear. Although the InsP3 receptor is not the primary calcium release channel in cardiac tissue, InsP3 may be involved in the regulation of Ca2+-induced Ca2+release. Increased InsP3 and the resulting increase in cytoplasmic free calcium may be an important mechanism for controlling cardiac contractile force in response to hormones and pharmacological factors as well as in the diseased state. A greater than 2-fold increase in steady state InsP3 receptor mRNA was observed during end-stage heart failure in human (21Go L.O. Moschella M.C. Watras J. Handa K.K. Fyfe B.S. Marks A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 888-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This increase was accompanied by a 31% decrease in the ryanodine receptor mRNA suggesting that the InsP3 receptor may participate in a compensatory role in cardiac intracellular calcium signaling dynamics. In this study, we have examined the expression of InsP3receptor in rat and ferret ventricular cardiac myocytes using immunological, molecular, and electrophysiological techniques. We show that in both rat and ferret myocytes the principal isoform of the InsP3 receptor expressed is the type 2 homologue. Functional reconstitution of this receptor isoform into planar lipid bilayers resulted in the identification of a Ca2+ release channel responsive to low levels of InsP3 and inhibited by heparin. [3H]InsP3 (21 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. [γ-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Corp. Unlabeled inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was purchased from LC Laboratories. Heparin was purchased from Fluka. CHAPS was from Boehringer Mannheim. l-α-Phosphatidylcholine,l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine, andl-α-phosphatidylserine were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Pelham, AL. Rat and ferret ventricular cardiac myocytes were isolated as described by Bassani et al. (22Bassani R.A. Bassani J.W.M. Bers D. J. Physiol.

Acutely dissociated ventricular myocytes were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol with 30 pestle strokes in a glass/Teflon Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder. Large particulate was sedimented with a 2-min 325 × gcentrifugation. The resulting supernatant fraction was transferred to TLA 100.3 ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman) and sedimented at 135,240 × g max at 4 °C for 10 min to yield crude microsomes.

Washed microsomes were resuspended to approximately 5–10 mg/ml protein and either used immediately or stored at −80 °C until use. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar, 24Mignery G.A.

Peptide competition experiments for the type 1 carboxyl-terminal and type 1 loop antisera were performed by preincubation in specific peptide (1 mg/ml) for 1 h prior to incubation with the immunoblot. InsP3 binding to ferret myocyte membrane preparations was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of [3H]InsP3 ranging from 0.42 to 50.5 nm. Each 100 μl assay contained 100 μg of protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.3, using the centrifugation binding assay as described previously (26Mignery G.A. Johnston P.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7450-7455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding assays were incubated on ice for 10 min in the presence of [3H]InsP3 and then microsomes were pelleted with a 10-min 289,000 ×g av centrifugation. The supernatants were removed from the assay tube, and the membrane pellet was solubilized in 1% SDS and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. All assays were performed in triplicate, and nonspecific3[H]InsP3 binding for each concentration was determined in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled InsP3. Similar results were obtained from three independent assays. The procedures for reverse transcription and PCR analysis are essentially as described by Newton et al. (10Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from rat and ferret ventricular myocytes, as well as rat left ventricular myocardium, whole heart, and cerebellum as described previously by Perin et al. (27Perin M.S.

Five μg of total RNA from rat and ferret samples was used as template for first strand cDNA synthesis. Each 50-μl reaction contained 500 μm dNTPs (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega), 1 μg of pd(N)6 random hexamer (Pharmacia) in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol plus 200–400 units Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and heat-inactivated for 5 min at 95 °C. The rat and ferret cDNAs were used as templates in 100-μl PCR assays containing 10 μl of cDNA, 200 μm dNTPs, 1 μm each sense and antisense oligonucleotides, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 units of AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). InsP3 receptor type-specific control templates were derived from pI7, pI15, and pI924-2 for the types 1, 2, and 3 receptors, respectively (5Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Sudhof T.C. J.

The oligonucleotide primers common to all receptor types used in the PCR assays were AGCAAGCTTGGC(T/C)CT(C/T)ATCCTGGT(C/T)TACCTGTTCTC and GTCAAGCTTGTCCCT(C/T)TCCAAGCC(G/A)CAGATGAAGCA. Reaction conditions consisted of two cycles at 94 °C for 5 min, 65 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 10 min and 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for for 4 min. PCR products derived from rat and ferret total RNA primed with the InsP3 receptor consensus oligonucleotides were resolved on triplicate 1% agarose gels and blotted to individual nitrocellulose membranes as described by Sambrooket al.

Blots were hybridized to receptor type-specific 32P-labeled oligonucleotides and washed at high stringency. The receptor type-specific oligonucleotides used for the hybridizations correspond to sequences within the PCR product as follows: type 1, CGCATCGATGGTCTTGTTGGCCTCTTTGGATGGCTTCCT; type 2, CCTCCCTCACCGGCTGCATTCGAAGA; and type 3, AGGGCTTGCTTAGAATGTCGC. Ribonuclease protection assays were performed using a HybSpeed RPA kit (Ambion) as described by the manufacturer. Receptor type-specific transcription plasmids were constructed by PCR amplification of nucleotides 7664–8186, 7448–7959, and 7254–7772 of the rat types 1, 2, and 3 isoforms, respectively, and insertion into EcoRI and BamHI digested pGEM-3Z (Promega). The oligonucleotide primers consisted of CGGGATCGGCTCTGATTCTGGTTTACCTGTTCTC and CGGAATTCTTGTCCCTTTCCAAGCCACAAATGAAGCA for the type 1, CGGGATCCTGGCTCTTATCCTGGTCTACCTGTTCTC and CGGAATTCTTGTCCCTCTCCAAGCCACAGATGAAGCA for the type 2, and CGGGATCCTGGCCCTCATCCTTGTCTACCTCTTCTC and CGGAATTCTTGTCCCTCTCCAGACCACAGATGAAGCA for the type 3 receptors. InsP3R-specific antisense probes were generated from these plasmids, linearized with BamHI, using T7 phage RNA polymerase and the MAXIscript (Ambion) in vitrotranscription kit in the presence of [32P]UTP. The expected run-off transcription product sizes were 531, 526, and 528 nucleotides for types 1, 2, and 3 receptors, respectively. Transcription products were purified on 5% acrylamide, 8 murea denaturing gels. Typical specific activities of the probes were greater than 1.3 × 109 dpm/μg and varied less than 5% between isoform-specific probes. The β-actin control antisense probe was derived from linearized pTRI-β-actin-mouse plasmid DNA. Ribonuclease protection assays were performed in the presence of 80,000 cpm each InsP3R-specific and mouse β-actin antisense probes using 10 μg of total RNA for all cardiac samples and with 2.5 μg of total RNA from cerebellum. Products from the RNase protection reactions were resolved on 5% acrylamide, 8 m urea denaturing gels, dried, and autoradiographed or quantitated using a Packard Instant Imager running Packard Imager for Windows V2.03. PCR products from rat and ferret RNA were digested with HindIII and ligated into similarly cut pBluescript SK. DNA sequencing was performed on double-stranded templates using 35S-dATP and Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing reagents (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Microsomes from ferret ventricular cardiac myocytes were solubilized in 1% CHAPS and fractionated on 5–20% sucrose gradients as described previously (5Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Gradient fractions containing the highest levels of receptor protein were identified by Western blotting and then reconstituted into proteoliposomes essentially as described by Ferris et al. (29Ferris C.D. Huganir R.L. Supattapone S. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Planar lipid bilayers were formed across a 220-μm diameter aperture in the wall of a Delrin partition. Lipid bilayer-forming solution contained a 7:3 mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine dissolved in decane (50 mg/ml). Proteoliposomes were added to the solution on one side of the bilayer (defined as cis). The other side was defined as trans (virtual ground). Standard solutions contained 220 mm CsCH3SO3 cis (20 mm trans), 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EGTA ([Ca2+]free = 200 nm). The [Ca2+]free was verified using a Ca2+ electrode. A custom current/voltage conversion amplifier was used to optimize single-channel recording (12Gyorke S. Fill M. Science. 1993; 260: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Acquisition software (pClamp: Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), an IBM compatible 486 computer, and a 12-bit A/D-D/A converter (Axon Instruments) were used. Single channel data were digitized at 5–10 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Channel sidedness was determined by InsP3 sensitivity. The orientation of the channels studied was such that the InsP3-sensitive side (i.e.cytoplasmic side) was in the cis compartment. The ion selectivity of previously reconstituted single InsP3R channels was nearly identical to that of single ryanodine receptor channels (30Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 821-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, a simple reconstitution strategy analogous to that successfully applied to study ryanodine receptor channels (31Hamilton S.L. Mejia-Alvarez R. Fill M. Hawkes M.J. Brush K.L. Schilling W.P. Stefani E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was used here to examine single InsP3R channels. This strategy utilized a monovalent cation (Cs+) instead of a divalent cation as charge carrier. The use of a monovalent charge carrier improves experimental success rate and increases the single-to-noise ratio. To define the expression of InsP3receptor(s) in ventricular cardiac myocytes, microsomal protein from both rat and ferret were electrophoresed on 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels along with bovine cerebellar microsomal proteins as a control. Following electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the blots were either incubated with antibodies directed against the carboxyl-terminal 19 amino acids (24Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. Takei K. DeCamilli P. Nature. 1989; 342: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), amino acid residues 2463–2476 (type 1 loop) (25Takei K. Mignery G.A. Mugnaini E. Sudhof T.C. DeCamilli P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 327-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), or the amino-terminal 324 amino acids of the type 1 InsP3R. The antisera derived from the amino-terminal 324 amino acids is directed against the highly conserved ligand binding domain and reacts with all receptor types tested (10Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mignery G.A. Johnston P.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7450-7455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The type 1-specific carboxyl-terminal antisera elicited a strong signal in proteins from bovine cerebellar microsomes (Fig.1, 1st panel, 1st lane) but failed to detect the presence of any immunologically cross-reactive species of similar size in the myocyte preparations of ferret (Fig. 1,1st panel, 2nd lane). The signal observed in the cerebellar sample was generated from one-tenth (10 μg) the amount of total membrane protein applied to the myocyte sample wells. Microsomes from rat and ferret cerebella were also immunoreactive (not shown). An immunoreactive signal was observed at M r ≃ 97,700 in ferret myocytes which was eliminated by pre-absorbing the carboxyl-terminal antibody with its corresponding peptide (Fig. 1,2nd panel). To investigate further whether the immunoreactive signal (M r ≃ 97,700) observed in the myocyte preparation with the carboxyl-terminal antisera represents a proteolytic fragment of the type 1 receptor, a second type 1-specific antibody directed against amino acid residues 2463–2476 (type 1 loop) was used for immunoblotting (Fig. 1, 3rd panel). In this panel, the type 1 receptor of cerebellum is strongly immunoreactive with no apparent signal of similar mobility as observed in the myocyte sample. As was seen with the type 1 carboxyl-terminal antisera, a different band of lower apparentM r (≃148,000) is seen which could be eliminated in peptide competition experiments (Fig. 1, 4th panel). The band of M r ≃97,700 observed using the carboxyl-terminal antisera is not detected with this antibody and suggests that the cross-reacting species is not the type 1 receptor. This conclusion is based on the observation that the carboxyl-terminal antibody is reacting with a protein species of approximately 97.7 kDa, and if this was a proteolytic fragment of the type 1 receptor it would cross-react with the type 1 loop antibody which is directed against residues 2463–2476 only 267 amino acids NH2-terminal to the COOH-terminal antibody and thus should reside on the same proteolytic fragment. The identity of the protein species which was faintly detected by the type 1 “loop” antibody remains uncertain. The weak signals observed with this and the COOH-terminal antisera may be a consequence of the large amounts of myocyte membrane proteins loaded onto the SDS-PAGE gels. When the Western blots were incubated with the consensus antisera derived from the receptor amino-terminal 324 amino acids, there was a significant signal observed at the expected apparent molecular weight (M r = 260 × 103) for the InsP3 receptor in both cerebellum and ferret cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1, 5th panel). As judged by the signal intensity between the myocytes and cerebellar protein samples, these data suggest that there is a significant amount of InsP3receptor protein present in cardiac myocytes and that the predominant isoform expressed is not type 1. It is unlikely that this signal represents the type 3 InsP3R due to its similar mobility to the cerebellar type 1 receptor on SDS-PAGE, since the type 3 receptor has a significantly smaller apparent M r(10Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ligand binding properties of the isoform expressed in cardiac myocytes was investigated using saturation binding measurements. Even though the various InsP3receptor family members exhibit a remarkable degree of sequence similarity, they have markedly distinct affinities for InsP3. The type 2 InsP3 receptor has the highest InsP3 affinity (K D = 27 nm) of the three characterized isoforms with a relative order of, type 2 > type 1 ≫ type 3 (6Sudhof T.C. Newton C.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig.2, [3H]InsP3binding to ferret myocyte membrane preparations was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of [3H]InsP3 ranging from 0.42 to 50.5 nm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.3, using the centrifugation binding assay as described previously (26Mignery G.A. Johnston P.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7450-7455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were performed in triplicate and nonspecific [3H]InsP3binding for each concentration was determined in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled InsP3. Similar results were obtained from three independent determinations. Analysis of the binding data using the Scatchard transformation results in a binding isotherm with a calculated K D equal to 23.6 nm and a B max = 0.46 pmol/mg (Fig. 2). These values are very similar to values previously reported (21 nm, 0.66 pmol/mg) with canine cardiac microsomes (32Kijima Y. Fleischer S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and that of the cloned and expressed type 2 InsP3 receptor ligand binding domain (27 nm) (6Sudhof T.C. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Mignery G.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Although significant variability exists for the reported K D values of the InsP3 receptors due to differences in purity and experimental conditions, the values obtained in this study are consistent with those of previous studies (6Sudhof T.C. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Mignery G.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) where membrane preparations and assays were performed using similar methodologies. These results (Fig. 2), together with the Western blotting data (Fig.1), suggest that the predominant species of InsP3R in cardiac ventricular myocytes is not the type 1 or type 3 InsP3 receptor and is consistent with the hypothesis that it may represent the type 2 isoform. To establish the identity of the InsP3R isoforms expressed in heart, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening strategies were performed. Several studies (10Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. J.

We have identified two alternatively spliced exons, 18N and 18A, that encode transmembrane segments S3 and S4 in domain III. Exon 18N is expressed in fetal brain and non-neuronal tissues. Transcripts with exon 18N have a conserved in-frame stop codon that predicts the synthesis of a truncated, two-domain protein similar to the fetal form of the muscle calcium channel. The proportion of transcripts containing exon 18N is highest in mouse fetal brain between E12.5 and P1.5; at later ages transcripts containing exon 18A predominate. This developmental program is recapitulated in P19 cells during retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation. Non-neuronal tissues contain a low level of SCN8A transcripts containing exon 18N. SCN8A thus provides a new model of differentiation specific splicing. Genomic analysis ofSCN8A from human, mouse, and fish demonstrated a conserved structure in which exon 18N is located 300–500 bp upstream of exon 18A. Duplication of exon 18 thus preceded the divergence of fish and mammals. The genomic organization, developmental regulation, and coding content of exons 18N and 18A closely resemble the previously described alternate exons 5N and 5A of the neuronal sodium channel genes. Our proposal that the evolutionary origin of exons 18N and 18A was by duplication of exons 5N and 5A is consistent with other evidence that the four-domain cation channels arose by two rounds of duplication from a single-domain ancestral channel.

Voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the rapid membrane depolarization associated with action potentials in nerves and muscles. Ten members of the sodium channel α subunit gene family have been mapped in the human and mouse genomes (1Burgess D.L. Kohrman D.C. Galt J. Plummer N.W. Jones J.M. Spear B. Meisler M.H. Nat.

The coding sequences of these family members are unusually highly conserved, but the genes exhibit different patterns of expression in neurons, glia, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle. The neuronal α subunit proteins also differ with regard to their site of membrane localization in cell bodies or processes. The 260-kDa α subunit protein contains four transmembrane domains (I–IV), each with six membrane spanning segments (S1 to S6). The transmembrane domains are linked by cytoplasmic loops and form the walls of a sodium-selective pore that is lined by four pore-forming segments.

https://openalex.org/W2089565248,"We show that a cellular virus receptor functions in the envelope of a virus, allowing selective infection of cells displaying the receptor ligand. A G-deficient rabies virus (RV) pseudotyped with CD4- and CXCR4-derived proteins selectively infected cells expressing HIV-1 envelope protein. Envelope protein or CD4 antibodies blocked virus entry. Pseudotype virus formation was most efficient with chimeric receptor proteins possessing the cytoplasmic tail of the RV G spike protein (CXCR4-RV and CD4-RV). While CXCR4-RV was incorporated when expressed alone, CD4-RV incorporation required CXCR4-RV as a carrier protein, indicating a mechanism by which oligomeric surface proteins are sorted into the RV envelope. Viral vectors bearing virus receptors in their envelope may be useful reagents for targeting virus-infected cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2091825641,"Exposure of mammalian cells to UV radiation alters gene expression and cell cycle progression; some of these responses may ensure survival or serve as mutation-avoidance mechanisms, lessening the consequences of UV-induced DNA damage. We showed previously that UV irradiation increases phosphorylation of the p34 subunit of human replication protein A (RPA) and that this hyperphosphorylation correlated with loss of activity of the DNA replication complex. To characterize further the role of RPA hyperphosphorylation in the cellular response to UV irradiation and to determine which protein kinases might be involved, we identified by phosphopeptide analysis the sites phosphorylated in the p34 subunit of RPA (RPA-p34) from HeLa cells before and after exposure to 30 J/m2 UV light. In unirradiated HeLa cells, RPA-p34 is phosphorylated primarily at Ser-23 and Ser-29. At least four of the eight serines and one threonine in the N-terminal 33 residues of RPA-p34 can become phosphorylated after UV irradiation. Two of these sites (Ser-23 and Ser-29) are known to be sites phosphorylated by Cdc2 kinase; two others (Thr-21 and Ser-33) are consensus sites for the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK); the fifth site (Ser-11, -12, or -13) does not correspond to the (Ser/Thr)-Gln DNA-PK consensus. All five can be phosphorylated in vitro by incubating purified RPA with purified DNA-PK. Two additional sites, probably Ser-4 and Ser-8, are phosphorylated in vivoafter UV irradiation and in vitro by purified DNA-PK.

RPA also interacts with several transcription factors, including VP16, Gal4, and p53, and may serve as a link between transcription and DNA replication (25Dutta A. Ruppert J.M. Aster J.C. Winchester E. Nature. 1993; 365: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 26He Z. Brinton B.T. Greenblatt J. Hassell J.A. Ingles C.J.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein inhibits RPA's ability to bind to single-stranded DNA (25Dutta A. Ruppert J.M. Aster J.C. Winchester E. Nature. 1993; 365: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Posttranslational modification is a well recognized mechanism for modulating protein activity and protein-protein interactions. Several posttranslational modifications of the RPA subunits have been reported, including phosphorylation and poly(ADP)ribosylation (28Din S. Brill S.J. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 29Moggs J.G. Yarema K.J. Essigmann J.M. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7177-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and differentially phosphorylated forms of RPA-p34 have been observed on the basis of retarded mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. RPA-p34 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner in both human and yeast cells (28Din S. Brill S.J. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation begins at the onset of S phase suggesting a possible role in regulating DNA replication. A mitosis-specific phosphorylated form of RPA-p34 also was observed. 2M. P. Carty, unpublished observations. 2M. P. Carty, unpublished observations. We and others (30Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar,31Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7222-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) previously showed that RPA-p34 is hyperphosphorylated upon exposure of cultured human cells to UV or ionizing radiation. This DNA damage-induced hyperphosphorylation is coincident with cell cycle arrest and loss of the ability of cell extracts to support DNA replication (30Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that phosphorylation of RPA-34 serves as an essential mechanism for modulating RPA activity and its interactions with other proteins. To understand the role of RPA phosphorylation in DNA replication, repair, and recombination, it is necessary to define characteristic phosphorylation sites in specific forms of RPA and to identify the enzyme activities responsible for their creation. This is particularly important because forms having similar migration on SDS gels may differ with respect to sites of phosphorylation and, therefore, in biological function. Cyclin-dependent kinases and the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) were postulated to catalyze phosphorylation of RPA-p34 in the S phase of the cell cycle. It was shown that RPA-p34 can be phosphorylated in vitro by cyclin A/cyclin B-Cdc2 kinase complex (on Ser-23 and Ser-29) (32Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 33Pan Z.-Q. Amin A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

Interestingly, in mouse scid cells, which are mutated in the gene for the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKCS), diminished levels of hyperphosphorylation of RPA were observed after DNA damage, pointing to a role for DNA-PKCS in DNA damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of RPA-p34 (20Boubnov N.V. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5700-5706Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Here, we describe an analysis of the sites phosphorylated in the hyperphosphorylated form of RPA-34, induced by UV irradiation. Several phosphopeptides generated from the UV-induced, hyperphosphorylated form of RPA were shown to be identical to phosphopeptides from HeLa or recombinant RPA phosphorylated in vitro by DNA-PK. Co-migrational phosphopeptide analysis identified Thr-21, Ser-23, Ser-29, Ser-33, Ser-11, -12, or -13, and probably Ser-8 and Ser-4 as sites of phosphorylation in the hyperphosphorylated form of RPA-p34 produced by exposure to UV light. The capacity of purified DNA-PK to phosphorylate many of these same sites on RPA-p34 in vitroimplicates DNA-PK or a kinase with similar specificity in the UV-induced hyperphosphorylation of RPA in vivo. [32P]Orthophosphate and [γ-32P] ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Corp. RPA from exponentially growing HeLa cells was purified as described (7Kenny M.K. Schlegel U. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7693-7700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA-PK was purified as described (35Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In some cases, a commercial preparation of DNA-PK (Promega) was used for comparison. Sequencing grade chymotrypsin was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. The DNA construct bearing the p34 subunit of human RPA was obtained from Dr. M. Wold (University of Iowa), and the recombinant RPA-p34 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to Erdile et al. (37Erdile L.F. Wold M.S. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3177-3182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Erdile L.F. Heyer W.-D. Kolodner R. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12090-12098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hypotonic cell extracts for DNA replication were prepared as described previously (30Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 39Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The synthetic peptides derived from p34-RPA sequences were as follows: I (3NSGFESYGSSSYGGA17), II (43AQHIVPCTISQLLSATLVDEVF64), and III (181APISNGMSEAGNF193), and phosphorylated synthetic peptides p4 (10GSSpSY14), pp6 (21pTQpSPGGF27), and pp7a (28GpSPAPpSQAEKK38) were purchased from Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. (Hopkinton, MA). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Cells were irradiated in phosphate-buffered saline with 30 J/m2of UV light (254 nm) from a low pressure mercury lamp. Following irradiation, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated for 8 h in 10 ml of phosphate-free media supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.5 mCi [32P]orthophosphate. Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (30Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-p34 monoclonal antibody 34A (30Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli buffer system (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were detected on dried gels by autoradiography. 32P-Labeled proteins were extracted from dried SDS-PAGE gels and processed as described (42Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). For proteolytic digestion we used sequencing grade chymotrypsin purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. This source of chymotrypsin appears to be contaminated with trypsin activity; thus, our phosphopeptide maps are those expected from digestion with chymotrypsin and trypsin (chymotrypsin/trypsin). The same lot of chymotrypsin was used for all the phosphopeptide maps shown in this paper; consequently, comparisons are valid. After proteolytic digestion, peptides were separated on thin layer cellulose plates by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 in the first dimension and by ascending chromatography in isobutyric acid buffer in the second dimension (42Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography. Synthetic phosphopeptides were visualized after staining with ninhydrin. To improve the resolution of phosphopeptides, in some experiments the (second) chromatography dimension was performed in parallel in two different buffers (phosphochromatography buffer and isobutyric acid buffer (42Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar)), which allowed us to resolve spots that comigrated or nearly comigrated when analyzed in only one chromatography buffer (data not shown). The two-dimensional peptide mobility prediction program Sortpeptide (provided generously by Dr. Tony Hunter, The Salk Institute) was used in conjunction with the University of Wisconsin's GCG software to generate predicted mobilities of phosphopeptides. The methods used in this program are described (42Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Purified RPA from HeLa cells was incubated with DNA-PK for 10 min at 30 °C in “replication kinase buffer” containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and, where indicated, with sheared calf thymus DNA (5 μg/ml). Replication kinase buffer has all the ingredients of in vitro replication buffer but has a lower concentration of ATP (50 μm instead of 1 mm) and does not have an ATP-regeneration system (30Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These changes were necessary to obtain adequate labeling of RPA. In vitrophosphorylated RPA-p34 was immunoprecipitated and fractionated by SDS-PAGE and processed for two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping as described above. Phosphorylation of synthetic peptides I, II, and III was carried out in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 200 μm peptide, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5 μg/ml sonicated calf thymus DNA (where indicated), and 10 units of DNA-PK or replication extracts (final protein concentration 6 mg/ml). Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and stopped by adding an equal volume of 30% acetic acid. The incorporation of radioactivity into the peptides was determined using an anion exchange resin, as described by Pearson et al. (43Pearson R.B. Mitchelhill K.I. Kemp B.E. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 265-291Google Scholar). For two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis and phosphoamino acid analysis, peptides were recovered by vacuum-assisted evaporation of acetic acid (Speed Vac, Savant Instruments Inc.) and subjected to two-dimensional and phosphoamino acid analysis as described above. Irradiation of cultured cells with UV light induces hyperphosphorylation of RPA-p34 (30Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Western immunoblot analysis of RPA-p34 from HeLa cells 8 h after mock exposure (Fig.1, lane 1) reveals that the rapidly migrating forms 1 and 2 are prevalent. In contrast, in a lysate from UV-irradiated HeLa cells (30 J/m2), additional phosphorylated forms that migrate more slowly (forms 3–5) are observed (Fig. 1, lane 2). Form 1 is the unphosphorylated form of RPA-p34 since it is absent on autoradiograms of RPA-p34 labeledin vivo with [32P]orthophosphate (30Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To determine the sites of phosphorylation on the slower migrating forms, we conducted two-dimensional analysis of chymotryptic/tryptic phosphopeptides of the in vivo radiolabeled p34 subunit of RPA. Fig. 2 compares the32P-labeled forms of RPA-p34 present in immunoprecipitates from mock-irradiated (lane 1) and UV-irradiated (30 J/m2; lane 2) cells. In UV-irradiated cells, the slowest migrating form (band 5) is more highly labeled than the faster migrating forms (bands 2–4). In contrast, in mock-irradiated cells the more slowly migrating forms are not as highly labeled. The regions of the gel containing the individual forms were excised, and the proteins were extracted, digested with chymotrypsin/trypsin, and resulting phosphopeptides subjected to two-dimensional analysis (Fig. 3). Comparison of the maps in Fig. 3, A–C, shows that the main phosphopeptides of the faster migrating forms 2 and 3 of RPA-p34 from unirradiated cells (Fig. 3 A) are essentially the same as the sum of those from form 2 (Fig. 3 B) and form 3 (Fig. 3 C) from UV-irradiated cells. The fastest migrating form (form 2) of UV-irradiated RPA-p34 (Fig. 3 B) has two main phosphopeptides, marked A and B, and two minor phosphopeptides, marked X and Y. The map of form 3 (Fig. 3 C) has phosphopeptides A and B but not phosphopeptide X and Y. Three other phosphopeptides, designatedC, X*, and Y*, are also present; phosphopeptide C is not present in form 2 (Fig. 2 B).Figure 3Comparison of two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis of RPA-p34 forms from HeLa cells labeled in vivowith [32P]orthophosphate. Nontreated HeLa cells (A) and ones irradiated with 30 J/m2(B–D) were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and whole cell lysates were prepared as described under “Material and Methods.” Proteins, immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody against RPA-p34, were detected by autoradiography. The forms of RPA-p34 (Fig. 2) were cut out and the proteins were extracted from the gel and digested with chymotrypsin/trypsin. The resulting phosphopeptides then were resolved in two dimensions by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 in the horizontal direction with the cathode on the right, followed by ascending chromatography (from bottom to top) in isobutyric acid buffer. The radiolabeled phosphopeptides were detected by autoradiography, and synthetic cold phosphopeptide markers were visualized by staining with ninhydrin. A, form 2 + form 3 from unirradiated HeLa cells; B, form 2 from UV-irradiated cells; C, form 3 from UV-irradiated cells; D, form 5 from UV-irradiated cells. Phosphopeptides of identified sequence are marked by numbers according to Fig. 4. Each phosphorylation event on the peptide is marked with the letter p. Phosphopeptides of unidentified sequence are marked with capital letters. Origins are indicated by O. Arrows indicate the positions of migration of unlabeled, chemically synthesized phosphopeptide markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 3 D shows the phosphopeptide map of the slowest migrating hyperphosphorylated form of RPA-p34 (form 5) from UV-irradiated cells. Many additional phosphopeptides are observed in form 5 in comparison with the faster migrating forms of RPA-p34. In the form 5 map, we observed the highly labeled phosphopeptide marked p4 migrating slightly below phosphopeptide A. At the left sideof the map, the most highly labeled phosphopeptide is marked aspp6, and there are about 9 other minor phosphopeptides to the left of the origin. In the lower right side of the map four additional phosphopeptides (marked p7, p7a,pp7, and pp7a) are evident. To assign specific spots to specific peptides of the RPA-p34 amino acid sequence (37Erdile L.F. Wold M.S. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3177-3182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we generated predicted chymotryptic/tryptic phosphopeptide maps of RPA-p34 using computer software described in Boyle et al. (42Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar) and confirmed these assignments by using synthetic phosphopeptide markers. For this analysis, we focused on amino acid residues 1–38 because Henricksen et al. (19Henricksen L.A. Carter T. Dutta A. Wold M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3107-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and Lee and Kim (44Lee S.-H. Kim D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) showed that RPA-p34 phosphorylation occurs primarily in this N-terminal region. The sequences of the peptides expected to be generated by chymotrypsin/trypsin digestion of these first 38 amino acids are shown in Fig. 4; Fig.5 A shows the predicted map of the phosphopeptides. We included in the map the partial trypsin digestion products, where peptide 7 with the additional basic residue of Lys-38, marked as 7a, has an additional positive charge, resulting in a characteristic shift in the migration to the direction of cathode (compare peptides p7 and p7a). Adding phosphate groups to a peptide makes it more negatively charged and less hydrophobic so the peptide migrates further toward the anode and less far in the chromatography dimension (for example, compare phosphopeptides p7 and pp7). Since chymotrypsin, cleavage may be inhibited by phosphorylation of serine or threonine two amino acids C-terminal to the cleavage site (45Benore-Parsons M. Seidah N.G. Wennogle L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 272: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 46Schellenberger V. Turck C.W. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4251-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), phosphorylation would be expected to inhibit cleavage between peptides 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, and 6 and 7. Therefore, we also generated predicted map positions for these incomplete digestion products of peptides 6 and 7 (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Predicted phosphopeptide maps of the N-terminal portion of RPA-p34. The predicted phosphorylated chymotryptic/tryptic fragments of the N-terminal 38 amino acids of RPA-p34 are plotted according to their predicted migration in two dimensions (42Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Open circles represent peptides 1–7 and 7a of this region (A). The partial trypsin digestion between amino acids 37 and 38 generates peptides 7 (amino acids 28–37) and 7a (amino acids 28–38). The additional basic residue of lysine (Lys-38) in 7a adds positive charge to the peptide, resulting in a characteristic shift in the migration to the direction of cathode.B, hatched circles represent phosphopeptides resulting from inhibition of cleavage between amino acids 27 and 28 by phosphorylation of the neighboring serine (Ser-29; see Fig. 4) yielding a longer peptide containing peptides 6 plus 7/7a. Phosphopeptides are marked by numbers according to Fig. 4. Each phosphorylation event on the peptide is marked with the letter p. Addition of phosphate to a peptide makes it more negatively charged and less hydrophobic; thus, it migrates further toward the anode and less far in the chromatography dimension (for example, compare phosphopeptides p7 and pp7).

LRP is a large multifunctional receptor mediating the clearance of diverse ligands, including selected lipoproteins, various protease inhibitor complexes, and thrombospondin. A soluble molecule (sLRP) has been isolated from plasma using an affinity matrix coupled with methylamine-activated α2-macroglobulin, the ligand uniquely recognized by LRP, and eluted with EDTA. This eluate contains a protein that co-migrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with authentic human placental LRP α-chain, is recognized by anti-LRP α-chain monoclonal antibodies, and binds the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) and tissue plasminogen activator-inhibitor complexes. A similar RAP-binding molecule was detected in medium conditioned for 24 h by primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, suggesting that the liver may be the in vivosource of sLRP. In contrast, immunoprecipitation experiments failed to detect the production of sLRP by cultured HepG2 hepatoma and primary human fibroblast cells. Addition of a soluble form of LRP to cultured HepG2 cells resulted in a significant inhibition of capacity of these cells to degrade tPA, a process that has been demonstrated to be mediated by cell surface LRP. Preliminary data indicate that the concentration of sLRP is altered in the plasma of patients with liver disease. Increased levels of sLRP may antagonize the clearance of ligands by cell bound LRP perturbing diverse processes including lipid metabolism, cell migration and extracellular proteinase activity.

Studies have demonstrated that LRP mediates the internalization of multiple, structurally unrelated ligands, including selected lipoproteins, proteinase-inhibitor complexes, plasminogen activators, and thrombospondin (reviewed in Refs. 3Krieger M.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The binding of all ligands to LRP is inhibited by the receptor-associated protein (RAP), a protein that was co-purified with LRP (2Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M.

The range of ligands recognized by LRP suggests that it plays a role in diverse processes including lipid metabolism, cell growth, migration, and tissue invasion. LRP expression is widespread; however, it is most highly expressed in the liver, brain, and placenta. The remarkable degree of cross-species identity conserved in the LRP amino acid sequence (3Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) and the embryonic lethal phenotype obtained after targeted disruption of the LRP gene in the mouse (6Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) underscore the biological importance of this molecule. Here we report the identification of a soluble form of LRP circulating in human plasma. The characterization of this molecule, which maintains the ligand binding characteristics of cell surface LRP, introduces a new dimension to the biology of LRP. Accumulation of soluble LRP in plasma may antagonize the clearance of ligands by cell-bound LRP, perturbing lipid metabolism and cellular processes involving extracellular proteinase activity. All chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from BDH (Kilsyth, Australia). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), benzamidine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, bacitracin, leupeptin, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and HEPES were purchased from Sigma. Electrophoresis reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. Proteins were iodinated with carrier free Na125I (Australian Radioisotopes, Lucas Heights, Australia) and iodogen reagent (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Recombinant RAP was synthesized as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein inEscherichia coli and purified as described previously (5Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RAP-GST/pGex plasmid was a generous gift from Joachim Herz, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX. α2-Macroglobulin (α2M) was purified from human plasma by Zn2+-chelate chromatography and gel filtration, as described previously (7Kurecki T. Kress L.F. Laskowski Sr M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It was activated by the addition of 0.2 m methylamine, 30 min, room temperature, dialyzed into 20 mm Mes, pH 6.0, and stored at 4 °C. Purified recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was donated by Karl Thomae GmbH (Biberach, Germany). Recombinant plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was expressed in E. coli transformed with a plasmid (pMBL11/PAI-1) containing full-length PAI-1 cDNA (Ref. 8Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J.

Biochem. 1994; 224: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), with additional purification by size exclusion chromatography on Bio-Gel P-60 (Bio-Rad). The anti-LRP α-chain monoclonal antibody (mAb 8G1) and affinity-purified rabbit anti-LRP (R777) were kind gifts of Dr. Dudley Strickland, American Red Cross, Rockville MD (2Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A commercial anti-LRP α-chain mAb (number 3402) was also purchased (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT). A hybridoma secreting an anti-LRP β-chain COOH-terminal peptide mAb (11H4; ATCC CRL-1936) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Antibodies were purified from culture supernatant using protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All cell culture reagents were purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA) and culture-ware was from Costar (Cambridge, MA). Microtiter plates (Maxisorp, Nunc, Denmark) were coated with 1 μg/well rRAP (100 μl) diluted in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 (2 h, 37 °C). After blocking in assay buffer (HBSC (20 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mmCa2+, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 80, 1% BSA), 30 min, 37 °C, a 100-μl sample (diluted in assay buffer) was added to the well and incubated 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the plates were incubated with 100 μl/well anti-LRP mAb (8G1, 5 μg/ml) in assay buffer, 1 h at room temperature. After washing, 100 μl of 1/1000 dilution rabbit anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Dako, Carpenteria, CA) was added (30 min, room temperature), and bound antibody was quantitated with 200 μl/well chromogenic substrate (1 mg/ml ABTS, 0.003%, v/v, H2O2diluted in citrate buffer, pH 4.5). Color development was stopped after 20 min by addition of 50 μl/well 3% oxalic acid, and the optical density at 405 nm (A 405) was determined. An affinity matrix was prepared by coupling 280 mg of methylamine-activated α2M to 25 ml of CNBr-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fresh frozen human plasma (200 ml) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine, 2 mm bacitracin, 1 μm leupeptin) was thawed at 37 °C. The plasma was adjusted to pH 7.4 by addition of 110volume 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 IU/ml heparin, 5 mm Ca2+, clarified by centrifugation (4 °C, 20 000g, 30 min), and filtered through a 0.4-μm nitrocellulose filter (Millipore-Waters, Milford, MA). The plasma was mixed with blank Sepharose gel for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared plasma supernatant was then mixed with methylamine activated α2M-Sepharose for 6 h at 4 °C. The affinity matrix was washed on a scintered glass funnel with 250 ml of HBSC, packed into a column and eluted with 25 mm EDTA, 20 mm Mes, pH 6.0. Protease inhibitors (as above) were added to each fraction (1 ml). LRP was also isolated from detergent-solubilized human placental membranes, prepared as described previously (10Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), using the activated α2M-Sepharose affinity matrix. The fractions were screened by specific LRP immunoassay and pooled positive fractions were stored at −20 °C. The material eluted from the activated α2M affinity matrix was fractionated by electrophoresis on 5–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed by silver staining (11Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). Prior to Western and ligand blot analysis samples were electrophoresed on 6% SDS-PAGE minigels for 2 h at 150 V. The gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (NEN Life Science Products) and incubated, according to the manufacturer's instructions, with 5 μg/ml mAb and 1/2000 dilution rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Dako). Bound antibody was visualized with chemiluminescence reagent (Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products) and exposed to film (Hyperfilm-MP, Amersham Corp.). For ligand blotting, blots were blocked in 5% milk, HBSC, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated (4 h at room temperature) in either 4 nm125I-ligand (RAP or tPA), washed, and exposed to film (24 h, −80 °C, intensifying screen). Blots were incubated in 125I-tPA in the presence of 100 nm PAI-1, resulting in the complete conversion of125I-tPA to an SDS-stable tPA·PAI-1 complex (data not shown). The specificity of binding was indicated by the absence of125I-ligand binding in the presence of 1 μmunlabeled RAP or tPA. All cell lines were cultured under standard conditions at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Hepatocytes were isolated from 230–270 g of anesthetized male Wistar rats by in situ two-stage collagenase perfusion of the liver, as described elsewhere (12Goodwin B. Liddle C. Murray M. Tapner M. Rooney T. Farrell G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The liver was excised and dispersed in modified Waymouth medium containing sodium bicarbonate (24 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), HEPES (18 mm), and insulin (25 milliunits/ml). Viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion, and only preparations with greater than 80% viable hepatocytes were used. Cells (3.0 × 106 in a final volume of 3 ml of Williams' medium E, supplemented as above) were overlaid onto 60-mm culture plates (Medos Company, Sydney, Australia) coated with 400 μl of matrigel prepared as described previously (13Kleinman H. McGarvey M. Hassell J. Star V. Cannon F. Laurie G. Martin G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). The culture medium was replaced after a 3-h attachment period and at 24-h intervals thereafter. HepG2 cells (ATCC HB8065, provided by M. Gallicchio, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia) were maintained in Earle's modified Eagle's medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were kindly provided by Dr. Gabrielle Delbridge (Center for Thrombosis and Vascular Research, University of New South Wales) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For experiments, cell monolayers were trypsinized, with HepG2 cells plated at 2 × 104 cells/ml and HFF plated at 5 × 103cells/ml. The cells were fed on day 3 and used for experiments on day 4 of culture when they were approximately 80% confluent. On day 7 of culture, cells and medium were harvested from rat hepatocyte cultures. Protease inhibitors were added to conditioned medium after it was centrifuged 4000 × g, 10 min. The cells, on ice, were lysed in 2 ml of 0.25% Triton X-100, HBSC + protease inhibitors (as above) and clarified by centrifugation 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The conditioned medium (8 ml) and the whole cell lysate (4 ml) were diluted 1/5 in 20 mm Mes, pH 6.0, and mixed with 1 ml of DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 20 mm Mes, pH 6.0. After washing with 20 mm Mes, pH 6.0, the gel was eluted with 0.5-ml aliquots of 20 mmMes, pH 6.0, 0.5 m NaCl. The eluted fractions (25 μl/lane) were electrophoresed on 6% SDS-PAGE gels, electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and incubated with125I-RAP, as described above. HepG2 cells and HFF were plated in 60-mm Petri dishes in 10 ml of culture medium. When the cells were 80% confluent, the monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 4 ml of cysteine/methionine-free EMEM, 10% FBS for 20 min at 37 °C. The cultures were then pulsed by incubation, 1 h, in the presence of 66 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label, ICN Biomedical). Long term labeling was conducted overnight in the presence of 20% cysteine/methionine complete EMEM. The chase period (0, 30, 60, 180, or 240 min) was initiated by the addition of 4 ml of EMEM, 10% FBS containing 0.2 mm unlabeled cysteine/methionine. Medium was collected and centrifuged 1200 × g for 5 min. Cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the dish by the addition of 4 ml of 1% Triton, HBSC + protease inhibitors (as above) and clarified by centrifugation 4000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were mixed with 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose (1:1 slurry, 30 min, 4 °C) and then incubated (4 °C, 2 h) in the presence or absence of 5 μg of anti-LRP α-chain mAb. After incubation with 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose (1:1 slurry, 30 min, 4 °C), the Sepharose was washed five times in 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, suspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and electrophoresed on a 5–15% gradient SDS-PAGE gel. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol, soaked in Amplify (Amersham Life Science, Inc., Little Chalfont, United Kingdom), and dried before exposing to film for 3 days. HepG2 cells plated in 24-well culture dishes were washed three times in EMEM, 0.2% BSA and incubated in 2 ml of medium containing 3 nm125I-tPA in the presence or absence of the following ligands: 1) 1 μm unlabeled tPA, 2) 2 μg/ml (3.3 nm) purified placental LRP, and 3) 10 μg/ml (16.7 nm) purified placental LRP. After incubation for appropriate times, binding medium was removed and mixed with an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid containing 4% phosphotungstic acid, incubated on ice for 10 min, centrifuged 10,000 ×g for 5 min, and a 1-ml aliquot of supernatant was counted in a γ-counter to determine counts/min of 125I-tPA degraded from triplicate cultures at each time point. The LRP immunoassay was used to determine the concentration of sLRP in human plasma. A standard curve was prepared by diluting affinity-purified placental LRP in the concentration range 0.125–2.5 μg/ml. sLRP concentrations were calculated from the standard curve using a four parameter curve fit. A preliminary study was conducted to determine the effect of blood additives and storage conditions on the estimation of LRP concentration by the LRP immunoassay. To determine the range of LRP in normal human plasma, citrated plasma was obtained from 50 healthy blood donors giving informed consent. In addition, citrated plasma samples (n = 45) were collected by the Clinical Chemistry Department, Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia. These plasma samples were obtained from patients with clinical manifestation of liver disease, which was confirmed by routine liver function test assessing plasma and urinary bilirubin, plasma alkaline phosphatase, plasma transaminases, plasma γ-glutamyltransferase. A third set of plasma samples from patients (n = 49) with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were kindly provided by Drs T. Mori and D. Dunstan, Department of Hematology, Royal Perth Hospital, Western Australia. An affinity matrix consisting of activated α2M-Sepharose is able to deplete plasma of an LRP-like molecule detected using a specific LRP immunoassay (Fig.1 A). Consistent with Ca2+-dependent ligand binding, the immunoreactivity was recovered by washing the column with 25 mm EDTA, pH 6.0 (Fig. 1 B). Analysis of the EDTA eluate of human plasma adsorbed to α2M-Sepharose by SDS-PAGE (reducing) revealed the presence of a single chain molecule which co-migrates with the α-chain of LRP (M r500,000) isolated from human placental membranes (Fig.2 A). The high molecular weight protein appears to be structurally and functionally related to human LRP α-chain, as it is recognized by an anti-LRP mAb (8G1) on Western blot and binds 125I-RAP in a ligand blot (Fig.2 A). In contrast, a mAb specific for the COOH terminus of LRP β-chain (M r 85,000) failed to specifically recognize any species in the enriched plasma fraction either by specific immunoassay (data not shown) or Western blot (Fig.2 B). A second, distinct anti-LRP mAb detected sLRP in the enriched plasma fraction, providing further evidence that the affinity eluate of human plasma contains a molecule closely related to LRP (Fig.2 C). A molecule of identical electrophoretic mobility was also recognized by an affinity-purified rabbit anti-human LRP polyclonal antibody (R777, a generous gift of Dr. Dudley Strickland, American Red Cross; data not shown).Figure 2Characterization of affinity-isolated sLRP. A, analysis of the plasma eluate (lane 2) by SDS-PAGE and silver stain revealed the presence of a band ofM r 500,000, which co-migrated with the α-chain of placental LRP (lane 1, arrow), was recognized by an anti-LRP α-chain mAb, 8G1, and bound 125I-RAP on a ligand blot. B, LRP β-chain migrates on SDS-PAGE withM r 85,000. The placental LRP preparation contains two molecules specifically recognized by the anti-LRP β-chain antibody: the strong band at M r 85,000 represents the mature LRP β-chain (arrow), while the size of the weaker high molecular weight band (M r>500,000) is consistent with incompletely processed LRP prohormone, which has not been cleaved into the two LRP subunits. The plasma affinity eluate did not contain a molecule that specifically reacted with the anti-LRP β-chain antibody. The band present atM r 120,000 in lane 2 was a nonspecific contaminant in this preparation, which was recognized directly by the secondary (rabbit anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase) antibody. C, further confirmation that the plasma affinity eluate contains a molecule closely related to LRP is provided by the recognition of a band, which co-migrated with placental LRP α-chain (not shown), by both the 8G1 mAb (lane 1) and a second, distinct anti-LRP α-chain mAb (lane 2) on Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ligand blot analysis of culture medium conditioned by primary cultures of rat hepatocytes revealed the presence of a125I-RAP-binding protein that co-migrated on SDS-PAGE with human placental LRP and a cell-associated molecule in cellular lysates of cell rat hepatocytes (Fig.3 A). Prior to analysis the conditioned medium was concentrated 16-fold by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled human HepG2 and HFF cells with an anti-LRP α-chain antibody (8G1) failed to detect the accumulation of a soluble form of LRP in the supernatant medium after a 4-h chase (Fig. 3 B). Cell-associated LRP was readily detected at each chase time point,i.e. from the end of the 1-h pulse onwards. Long term labeling experiments (up to 24 h) also failed to detect soluble forms of LRP in medium conditioned by these cells (data not shown). The uptake and degradation of tPA has been demonstrated to be mediated by LRP and can be inhibited by the LRP antagonist RAP (14Bu G. Williams S. Strickland D.K. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7427-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Ligand blot analysis demonstrates that both the purified placental LRP and the plasma-derived sLRP bind125I-tPA·PAI-1 complexes (Fig.4 A). Fig. 4 Bdemonstrates the inhibition of 125I-tPA degradation by HepG2 cells when assays were conducted in the presence of 10 μg/ml (16.7 nm) purified placental LRP. sLRP levels were measured in healthy subjects to define the normal concentration range. The plasma sLRP concentration estimated using the LRP immunoassay did not vary significantly when blood from healthy donors was collected into a dry tube (serum, 6.9 μg/ml), EDTA (6.5 μg/ml), or citrate (6.8 μg/ml), when samples were assayed at 10–20-fold dilution in Ca2+-containing assay buffer. Addition of 10 IU/ml heparin to the assay buffer to prevent postdilution clotting also did not interfere with the estimation of sLRP concentration. The range of sLRP concentration detected in the plasma of healthy subjects (n = 50; mean 6.1 ± 1.2 μg/ml; range 3.7–10.8 μg/ml), patients with abnormal liver function (n = 45; mean 7.1 ± 3.44 μg/ml, range = 2.0–22.4 μg/ml), and patients with NIDDM (n = 49; mean 6.5 ± 0.9 μg/ml, range = 5.0–9.0 μg/ml) is shown in Fig. 5. The plasma concentration of sLRP was significantly altered (varied by >2 S.D. from the mean normal concentration, i.e. outside the range 3.7–8.5 μg/ml) in 24% plasma samples from patients with abnormal liver function. In the NIDDM disease control group, only two plasma samples (4%) contained a significantly altered sLRP concentration (both above 8.5 μg/ml). The altered plasma sLRP concentrations associated with abnormal liver function test did not correlate with disease etiology nor with the level of any plasma proteins assayed, including bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, transaminases, γ-glutamyltransferase or 5′-nucleotidase. LRP belongs to the low density lipoprotein receptor family, the members of which share many structural and functional characteristics (3Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The α-chain of the heterodimeric LRP contains multiple, Ca2+-dependent ligand binding domains and is noncovalently bound on the cell surface to the membrane-spanning β-chain (15Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The characteristics of the soluble molecule circulating in human plasma suggest it is a molecule closely related to the α-chain of LRP: it displays Ca2+-dependent binding to two established LRP ligands RAP and activated α2M, a ligand uniquely recognized by LRP; it is a single chain molecule which co-migrates on SDS-PAGE with authentic human placental LRP α-chain; and it is recognized by two distinct anti-LRP α-chain monoclonal antibodies. We were unable to detect the intracellular COOH terminus of the LRP β-chain in the affinity-isolated sLRP. However, it is possible that a truncated β-chain may be associated with the soluble α-chain. Precise determination of the exact structure of plasma sLRP and its relative affinity for the various LRP ligands will only be possible with a highly purified preparation of sLRP. These studies are currently under way. The presence of a circulating LRP-like molecule is not confined to human plasma, and a similar molecule has been detected in plasma and serum from a variety of mammals and the chicken. 2P. G. Grimsley, K. A. Quinn, and D. A. Owensby, manuscript in preparation. LRP is most highly expressed in the liver, and analysis of culture medium conditioned by primary cultures of rat hepatocytes revealed the presence of an sLRP-like 125I-RAP-binding protein. Our experiments could not detect the release of a soluble form of LRP from the human hepatoma cell line HepG2, nor from cultured normal human fibroblasts, suggesting that the release of sLRP is not a constitutive property of all cultured cells. The absence of sLRP in medium conditioned by the hepatoma cell line suggests that the production of sLRP may be associated with the more differentiated phenotype of the primary hepatocytes cultured on matrigel (16Scheutz E.G. Li D. Omiecinski C.J. Muller-Eberhard U. Kleinman H.K. Elswick B. Guzelian P.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to investigate the factors regulating the production of sLRP. The detection of sLRP in hepatocyte-conditioned medium provides a model system for the further characterization of sLRP and the elucidation of the mechanism generating the soluble form. A wide variety of receptors and other plasma membrane proteins have been identified as having soluble counterparts in serum (17Ehlers M.R.W. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10065-10071Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). There are examples in the literature of soluble receptors liberated by proteolytic cleavage of receptor exodomains (18Lantz M. Gulberg U. Nilsson E. Olsson I. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 19Rutledge E.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31864-31868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and those that derive from differential splicing of a common mRNA transcript or transcription of closely related, but distinct, genes (20Horiuchi S. Koyanagi Y. Zhou Y. Miyamoto H. Tanaka Y. Waki M. Matsumoto A. Yamamoto M. Yamamoto N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the case of LRP, another potential mechanism for the generation of sLRP could be the disruption of the noncovalent bond that anchors the α-chain to the membrane-spanning β-chain (15Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A soluble form of gp330, another member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, has been detected in the supernatant of a yolk sac carcinoma cell line (21Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4082-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this cell line gp330 was present on the cell surface and in supernatant as a complex with RAP. No further characterization of the cellular and molecular events regulating gp330/RAP release has been reported. Soluble receptors, generally, have reduced ligand affinity constants compared with their membrane-bound counterparts, and the circulating receptor concentration may be insufficient to effectively compete ligand binding to the cell-bound molecule (22Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Our preliminary experiment indicates that the addition of soluble purified placental LRP at a physiologically relevant concentration (10 μg/ml) was able to inhibit the degradation of tPA by cultured HepG2 cells, a process that has been demonstrated previously to be mediated by cell surface LRP (14Bu G. Williams S. Strickland D.K. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7427-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This indicates that the sLRP may act as a competitive inhibitor of ligand uptake by cell surface-bound LRP. The inhibition of tPA uptake by soluble LRP may have negligible consequences to the level of extracellular proteolysis, because the enzyme is rapidly inactivated before endocytosis by complex formation with plasminogen activator inhibitor-I (PAI-1), present in large excess in the extracellular matrix of HepG2 cells (23Owensby D.A. Sobel B.E. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10587-10594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Owensby D.A. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, LRP mediates the uptake of many biologically active molecules, including the potent angiogenesis inhibitor, thrombospondin (25Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), apoE-enriched lipoproteins (26Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Esser V. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5810-5814Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), lipoprotein-lipase (27Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Muhonen L.E. Pladet M.W. Iverius P.-H. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14168-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is able to bind directly active tPA (28Bu G. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15595-15602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and urokinase PA (29Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increased levels of soluble LRP may extend the half-life of these active ligands and influence diverse biological processes, including lipid metabolism, cell growth, and migration and extracellular proteinase activity. The identification of a soluble molecule with the characteristics of LRP introduces a new dimension into the biology of this unique molecule. Further studies are required to understand the biochemical mechanisms involved in the generation of sLRP and establish its physiological role. The concentration of plasma sLRP appears to alter in some patients with impaired liver function. A more extensive study is required to substantiate this preliminary data and elucidate the functional implications of the moderate changes. As LRP has been implicated to be overexpressed in a range of other pathological processes, including atherosclerosis (30Lupu F. Heim D. Bachmann F. Kruithof E.K.O. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1994; 14: 1438-1444Crossref Google Scholar) and Alzheimer's disease (31Rebeck G.W. Reiter J.S. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Neuron. 1993; 11: 575-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar), the functional or prognostic implications of plasma sLRP concentration requires investigation. We thank Dr. Philip Hogg for critical reading of the manuscript."

We have studied the interaction between Lyn and the FcεRI in vivo using a transfection-based approach. FcεRI were stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells. The small amount of endogenous Src family kinase was sufficient to phosphorylate receptor tyrosines upon extensive aggregation of FcεRI but not after addition of dimers of IgE. Upon stable co-transfection of Lyn kinase into the cells, dimers were now able to stimulate receptor phosphorylation and the response to more extensive aggregation was enhanced. In contrast, co-transfection with catalytically inactive Lyn inhibited the aggregation-induced phosphorylation by the endogenous kinase, and a quantitatively similar inhibition was observed in cells transfected with the SH4-containing unique domain of Lyn. Consistent with the results of others using alternative approaches, our additional studies using a yeast two-hybrid system detected a direct interaction between intact Lyn or its unique domain and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the β chain but not with the receptor's other cytoplasmic domains.

The family of proteins known as the “multichain immune recognition receptors” includes the antigen receptors on B and T-lymphocytes and Fc receptors including the receptor with high affinity for IgE (FcεRI) 1The abbreviations used are: FcεRI, high affinity receptor for IgE; bp, base pair(s); BSA, bovine serum albumin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DNP, dinitrophenyl; ITAM, immuno-recognition tyrosine-based activation motif; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; Tricine,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine. (1Keegan A.D. Paul W.E. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 63-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Highly homologous in structure, all these receptors utilize, at least in part, a common mechanism to initiate cellular responses; multivalent interactions with antigen lead to aggregation of the receptors and is followed by enhanced phosphorylation of tyrosines (in the “ITAM” motifs within the cytoplasmic domains) of the receptor itself by a receptor-associated Src family kinase (2Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar). For FcεRI, we recently presented direct evidence for a “transphosphorylation” mechanism that accounts for the earliest events (3Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4Yamashita T. Mao S.-Y. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The data showed that a small fraction of receptors are constitutively associated with the Src family kinase Lyn (4Yamashita T. Mao S.-Y. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) and that the enhanced phosphorylation that follows aggregation of the receptors is likely to result simply from the apposition of the kinase with its substrate. We have also shown that when the kinase available to the receptor is limited, shuttling of the enzyme between individual aggregates can regulate the intensity of the signal (6Torigoe C. Goldstein B. Wofsy C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1372-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 2C. Wofsy, C. Torigoe, U. M. Kent, H. Metzger, and B. Goldstein, submitted for publication. The experiments described in this paper mainly explored the sites of interaction between Lyn kinase and FcεRI. For the most part, the prior studies of others explored the interaction between Lyn and isolated portions of the receptor (7Jouvin M.-H.E. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Valle A. Kinet J.-P.

Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) used in some of our studies is an analogous approach. We also employed transfection techniques, which allowed us to examine the kinase-receptor interactions in a more physiological setting. The latter experiments also allowed us to test the effect of varying the level of Lyn on the responsiveness of the receptors to discrete stimuli, and thereby to test certain quantitative predictions made by the current model. The yeast strains (CG1945 and Y187) and cloning vectors (pAS2-1 and pACT) were obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA); the expression vectors pBlueBac, pCDM8, and pZeo, as well as a baculovirus MAXBAC expression kit from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA); polyacrylamide gels used for electrophoresis (PAGE) from NOVEX (San Diego, CA); the antibiotics (G418, zeocin) from Life Technologies, Inc. and Invitrogen, respectively; and plasmid DNA purification kits from Qiagen (Santa Clarita, CA). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) antibodies were obtained conjugated to horseradish peroxidase from Transduction Laboratories (PY-20) or Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (4G10). Polyclonal antibodies to human Src family kinases Lyn and Fyn were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; antibodies to c-Src and c-Yes were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-DNP IgE (12Liu F.T. Bohn J.W. Ferry E.L. Yamamoto H. Molinaro C.A. Sherman L.A. Klinman N.R. Katz D.H. J.

Immunol. 1966; 29: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Goat anti-mouse IgE was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA); rabbit anti-rat IgE was purified as described (17Taurog J.D. Mendoza G.R. Hook W.A. Siraganian R.P. Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1977; 119: 1757-1761PubMed Google Scholar). Covalently cross-linked IgE oligomers were prepared and analyzed as described (6Torigoe C. Goldstein B. Wofsy C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1372-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells were maintained as described previously (18Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) were grown in stationary flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Iscove's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 25 mm HEPES, and the appropriate antibiotics to maintain expression of the transfected genes. Spodoptera frugiperda(Sf9) insect cells were maintained in spinner culture at 27 °C as described previously (191555Summers, M. D., and Smith, G. E. (1988) Tex. Agric. Expt. Stn. Bull. , 1555.Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of each expression construct was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using a dye terminator kit obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). A 5′-stretch cDNA library was prepared from mRNA isolated from RBL cells. Two separate priming reactions with either oligo(dT) or random primers were performed to generate the first strand. The reactions were pooled prior to second strand synthesis. The cDNA library was then prepared in the expression vector pCDM8 (20Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar). Probes were prepared by restriction digestion of human Lyn A-pSVL. Probes representing the N terminus (amino acid residues 1–298) and the C terminus (residues 163–512) were purified. The library was plated, and colony lifts were hybridized with either probe. Positive colonies went through secondary and tertiary screening. The nucleotide sequences of two clones, designated N14 (2052 bp) and C18 (2316 bp), were determined by primer walking and DNA sequencing of both strands. The Wisconsin package from the Genetics Computer Group, Inc. was used to assemble and analyze the nucleotide sequences of the isolated clones. N14 contained an open reading frame of Lyn A, beginning with ATG from bp 80 to bp 1616, while clone C18 encoded Lyn B beginning with ATG between bp 236 and bp 1709. The sequence of Lyn A in the coding region was identical to a previously published sequence (21Minoguchi K. Kihara H. Nishikata H. Hamawy M.M. Siraganian R.P. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); the sequence of rat Lyn B lacks an “insert” of 21 amino acids found in the A form of the kinase at a position identical to that previously shown for human and murine Lyn (22Yamanashi Y. Fukushige S. Semba K. Sukegawa J. Miyajima N. Matsubara K. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23Yi T.L. Bolen J.B. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 2391-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) but is otherwise identical to Lyn A. Therefore, it differs somewhat from the previously published sequence for rat Lyn B (24Rider L.G. Raben N. Miller L. Jelsema C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 138: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). 3The open reading frame of our Lyn B cDNA is identical to the Lyn A except for the missing 21-residue “insert.” The differences in the sequence originally reported (24Rider L.G. Raben N. Miller L. Jelsema C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 138: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) probably resulted from sequencing errors or errors introduced during amplification with PCR. Two further clones, a partial Lyn A cDNA and a full-length Lyn B cDNA isolated from an RBL library, confirmed our sequence. CHO cells were transiently transfected with the Lyn-pCDM8 plasmids by electroporation, harvested 48–72 h later, and a lysate of the whole cells was prepared using SDS. After separation by PAGE and transfer, Western blotting with anti-human Lyn confirmed that the expressed proteins had the expected the size for Lyn A (56 kDa) and Lyn B (53 kDa) (data not shown). To generate DNA binding domain fusion proteins, the N-terminal (1–58) and C-terminal (201–243) cytoplasmic domains of the rat FcεRIβ were amplified by PCR from the full-length cDNA and cloned into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of pAS2-1. The cytoplasmic domain of rat FcεRIγ (residues 27–68), as a PCR fragment, was cloned into NcoI/BamHI site of pAS2-1, to generate pAS2-1-γC. To create activation domain fusion proteins, the full-length Lyn A and Lyn B and various deletion mutants were amplified by PCR and cloned into BamHI/XhoI sites of pACT (Fig. 1). Plasmid constructs were introduced into yeast cells by lithium acetate, following the protocol provided byCLONTECH. Transformants were plated on synthetic medium containing 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-trizole and lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (SD-3) to detect the His phenotype, or synthetic medium lacking leucine and tryptophan (SD-2), to measure transformation efficiency. The β-galactosidase activity of transformants was measured in a filter assay with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate or in a liquid assay with ano-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside substrate according to the CLONTECH protocol. The 2.3-kilobase pair Lyn B XhoI-digested insert was isolated from pCDM8 and subcloned into the XhoI site of pZeo. The unique domain construct was generated by PCR amplification using internal sense and antisense primers for the unique domain: (5′-CGGGCGGCTCGATGGGATGTATTAAATCAAAAAGGAAAG-3′, and 5′-CGGCGGCTCGAGCTAGTCCCCTTGCTCCTCTGGATC-3′, respectively). The final PCR product was digested with XhoI and cloned back into the pZeo XhoI site. The catalytically inactive Lyn B(K279R)-pZeo construct was prepared using the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis system from Promega (Madison, WI) as follows. A 2.3-kilobase pair XbaI fragment of Lyn B from Lyn-pCDM8 was ligated into the XbaI site of pAlter-1. Mutagenesis followed the manufacturer's protocol using the ampicillin repair primer provided in the kit and a Lyn single mutation antisense oligonucleotide: (5′-GCCAGGCTTGAGGGTCCTTACAGCCACTTTTGTGC-3′) to convert TTC (Lys) → TCC (Arg). The mutant Lyn B was digested with XhoI and BstBI and ligated back into pZeo. Using Lipofectin reagent-mediated transfection (Life Technologies, Inc.), pSVL constructs of the α, β, and γ subunits of rat FcεRI along with pSV2neo had been previously introduced into CHO cells, and a clone expressing a high number of receptors was frozen. 4C. Pucillo, unpublished studies. After thawing, expression of receptors decreased rapidly with time in culture, so we recloned the culture by incubating it with fluorescein-conjugated IgE and sorting on a fluorescence activated cell sorter. The 1% of cells expressing the highest number of receptors were resorted on 96-well plates at 0.5 cell/well. Fifty surviving clones were screened for expression of receptors, by growing the cells to confluence and sensitizing them with 125I-labeled mouse IgE. The washed adherent cells were solubilized with boiling SDS sample buffer and the IgE in the extract quantitated by γ-counting. Of five high expressing clones, one (CHO-B12) proved highly stable and was used for all subsequent studies. CHO-B12 cells were cryopreserved by freezing in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, 95% growth medium; higher concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide caused a rapid decline in FcεRI. The cells were electroporated (0.4-cm gap cuvettes, 200 V, 500 microfarads) in the presence of one of several rat Lyn-pZeo constructs or empty pZeo vector, which had been linearized by digestion with Eco57I. To select resistant clones, the medium was supplemented with 250 μg/ml zeocin 72 h post-transfection. The human Lyn B cDNA (1.5 kilobase pairs) was excised from pSVL by XbaI digestion and ligated into the homologous NheI site of pBlueBac. Sf9 cells were co-transfected with wild type AcMNPV DNA and the Lyn construct to generate recombinant Lyn baculoviruses. Adherent Sf9 cells were infected with plaque-purified baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.4 and, after 48 h, lysed in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P) indicated that the Lyn B protein was phosphorylated on tyrosine as it was produced in the insect cells (data not shown). CHO cells to be stimulated with antigen were sensitized overnight with 125I-labeled mouse anti-DNP mouse IgE, washed three times in buffer A (150 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 25 mm Pipes, pH 7.2) plus 0.1% (w/v) gelatin and 5.4 mm dextrose, and resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml. DNP6-BSA was added as a 5-fold stock solution to 5 × 106 cells at 37 °C for the times indicated. CHO cells stimulated with IgE oligomers were incubated with the indicated concentrations at 37 °C for the times indicated. After stimulation, the receptors were solubilized in 0.05% Triton X-100 (3Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, anti-mouse or anti-rat IgE antibody was prebound to 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads overnight in borate-buffered saline, pH 8, containing 0.1% gelatin. The beads were recovered by centrifugation and combined with the lysates (“precleared” with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads overnight) for 2 h. After recentrifugation the immunoprecipitates were washed four times as described previously (3Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and the bound proteins released by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated receptors were separated by electrophoresis in SDS on 10% polyacrylamide gels equilibrated with Tricine and the phosphorylated proteins detected with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham) (25Alber G. Kent U.M. Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2428-2436PubMed Google Scholar). Autophotographs of Western blots were quantitated by computerized densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Three steps were taken to ensure equal numbers of receptors were being compared in those studies in which cells co-transfected with inactive forms of Lyn were compared with cells that had not been co-transfected. First, the cells were incubated with IgE that had been labeled with125I and equal numbers of counts were loaded per lane. Second, one lane on each gel was loaded with the same amount of phosphorylated human Lyn B to correct for differences in transfer, antibody staining, washing, etc. Third, the primary anti-Tyr(P) blots were stripped and reprobed with an antibody (JRK) to the β chain of the receptor (26Rivera J. Kinet J.-P. Kim J. Pucillo C. Metzger H. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 647-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and densitometric analysis was repeated. The densitometric values from the primary anti-Tyr(P) blots were then corrected for any differences in anti-Tyr(P) staining or loading of receptors. In separate experiments, the linearity of antibody staining (anti-Tyr(P), anti-β) was verified by loading increasing amounts of an appropriate protein extract and quantitating the band intensity. To quantitate the relative amounts of Lyn, whole cell lysates containing either 7 × 104 or 1.6 × 105 cell eq were prepared with SDS for each transfectant. Depending on which molecules had been transfected, the samples were separated on 8% (Lyn B, RK Lyn), 10% (CHO-B12, pZeo), or 4–20% (unique Lyn A) Tris-glycine gels and blotted with an anti-Lyn antibody and an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. One (central) lane on each gel was loaded with a fixed amount of human Lyn B (above). The densitometric readings for the bands corresponding to Lyn were normalized relative to the human Lyn B standard. CHO cells were suspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml and incubated with 5 μg/ml125I-labeled IgE for 1 h at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding was evaluated by preincubating the cells with a 10-fold excess of unlabeled IgE for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were separated from unbound IgE by pelleting through phthalate oil (15Kulczycki Jr., A. Metzger H. J. Exp. Med. 1974; 140: 1676-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 27Matthyssens G.E. Hurwitz E. Givol D. Sela M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1975; 7: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). CHO cells were sonicated, and the 140,000 × g supernatant (cytosolic fraction) and pellet (membrane fraction) were prepared from the post-nuclear supernatant as described previously (28Pribluda V.S. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11446-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, for 30 min at 4 °C. Each subcellular fraction was treated with an equal volume of boiling 2 × SDS sample buffer for 5 min prior to gel electrophoresis. Coupled in vitrotranscription-translation reactions were conducted with [35S]Cys according to the manufacturer's recommendation (T3 TnT® coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega). Initial identification of potentially interacting domains was conducted by co-transforming constructs containing the cytoplasmic domains of the FcεRI fused to the binding domain of the Gal4 transcription factor with constructs containing Lyn or various mutated forms of Lyn fused to the activation domain of Gal4 (Fig.1). The nucleotide sequence coding for the N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of the β subunit of the rat IgE receptor, βNand βC, were subcloned into pAS2 to generate Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion proteins. Unfortunately, both fusion proteins autonomously activated the reporter genes. This is presumably due to the acidic hemagglutinin epitope located between the Gal4 DNA binding domain and the inserted proteins (29Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar). However, the fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of the γ subunit was not autonomously active. Therefore, we subcloned nucleotide sequences coding for βN and βC into the newly developed vector pAS-2-1, which is similar to pAS2, but has the acidic hemagglutinin epitope removed. Neither pAS2-1-βC or pAS2-1-βN were autonomously active. The activities of the His and LacZ reporter genes in CG1945 yeast transformants expressing Lyn and βN, βC or γC were tested as described (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both the full-length and unique domain of both Lyn A and Lyn B interacted directly with βC (data not shown). However, the interaction was much weaker than the interaction detected between the p53 and SV40 fusion proteins used as a positive control. Thus, per microgram of DNA, co-transformation with p53 and SV40 resulted in more colonies on His-deficient medium (SD-3) and rapid growth into large colonies. All of the colonies containing p53 and SV40 rapidly turned blue. In contrast, co-transformation with the Lyn and βC constructs resulted in fewer colonies and slower growth on His-deficient medium and only the large colonies turned blue. No interaction was detected between βN or γC with any forms of Lyn in this assay. To quantitate the interaction between Lyn and βC or βN, we measured the β-galactosidase activity of these co-transformants in yeast strain Y187 in a liquid assay. In addition to the full-length Lyn and the construct containing only the unique domain, we tested a series of Lyn mutants based on the results of Pleiman et al. (30Pleiman C.M. Abrams C. Gauen L.T. Bedzyk W. Jongstra J. Shaw A.S. Cambier J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4268-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and Timson Gauen et al. (31Timson Gauen L.K. Kong A.N. Samelson L.E. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The negative control in this experiment was the 40 amino acid residues (from 27 to 66) of Lyn fused out-of-frame to the Gal4 activation domain (pACT-27–66-OOF). As shown in Fig. 2, the activity of the LacZ reporter gene from co-transformants with the unique domain of either Lyn A or B was as high as that from co-transformants with the full-length form of either Lyn. These values are 3-fold higher than those than from the negative control pACT-27–66-OOF. Consistent with the result from CG1945 strain, the interaction between Lyn and βC is weaker (on the basis of the β-galactosidase activity, only 1% as strong) than that between p53 and SV40. Co-transformants containing Lyn residues 1–10, 1–27, or 27–66 produced only slightly higher amounts of β-galactosidase than the negative control. Again, no interaction between Lyn and βN was detected. A clone of transfected CHO cells that stably expressed ≈170,000 receptors/cell (CHO-B12) (Table I) was further characterized. When immunoblotted with anti-human Lyn antibody, extracts of these cells, like those of the untransfected CHO cells, show a weakly reactive component at ≈58 kDa, i.e. slightly greater than the apparent molecular mass of 53 and 56 kDa observed for rat Lyn (Fig. 3 A). There was no reactivity with a panel of antibodies to human c-Src, Fyn, or c-Yes (data not shown). Cells from the B12 clone were incubated with anti-DNP-specific mouse IgE and after solubilization with detergent, the bound (unaggregated) receptors were immunoprecipitated with goat anti-mouse IgE. Upon Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P), no evidence for phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). When the cells were incubated with multivalent antigen (DNP-BSA) prior to solubilization, phosphorylation of tyrosines on the β and γ subunits of the transfected receptors was observed (lane 2). Disaggregation of the receptors in vivo by addition of hapten (DNP-caproic acid) after the exposure to DNP-BSA led to the complete reversal of the antigen-induced phosphorylation of receptor tyrosines within ≤1 min (data not shown).Table ICHO transfectantsNameCloneInsertFcεRILyn per FcεRILyn (Inact.) per Lyn (End.)×10 −5CHO-B121-aA stable CHO FcεRI transfectant (CHO-B12) was generated by electroporation of FcεRI subunits (α, β, γ).

In contrast, incubation of the CHO-B12 cells with dimeric IgE failed to induce detectable phosphorylation of the receptors (Fig. 3 B,lane 4). These results are consistent with a limiting amount of protein-tyrosine kinase being associated with the receptors in these cells (see “Discussion”).

In contrast, very little is known about the molecular identity of intracellular Cl− channels. We used a polymerase chain reaction-based approach to identify candidate genes in mammalian brain and cloned the cDNA corresponding to rat brain p64H1. This encoded a microsomal membrane protein of predictedM r 28,635 homologous to the putative intracellular bovine kidney Cl− channel p64. In situ mRNA hybridization histochemistry showed marked expression in hippocampus and cerebellum, and in vitroexpression revealed a large cytoplasmic domain, one membrane-spanning segment, and a small nonglycosylated N-terminal luminal domain. The predicted protein contained consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and protein kinase A, and protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation increased the M r of p64H1 to ∼43,000, characteristic of the native protein in Western blots. Recombinant p64H1 was immunolocalized to the endoplasmic reticulum of human embryonic kidney 293 and HT-4 cells, and incorporation of human embryonic kidney 293 endoplasmic reticulum vesicles into planar lipid bilayers gave rise to intermediate conductance, outwardly rectifying anion channels.

Although a concerted effort to understand the molecular basis of intracellular ion transport has revealed the molecular identities of several intracellular cation channels, intracellular Cl− channels are much less well characterized. Nevertheless, it has been speculated that anion channels may help to regulate organelle volume or conduct counterions to balance intracellular Ca2+ uptake and release. Such channels could therefore have important roles in many cellular processes. Experimental work by Landry et al. (15Landry D.W. Reitman M. Cragoe E.R. Al-Awqati Q. J. Gen.

Taken as a whole, this work strongly suggested that p64 was a component of an intracellular Cl−channel, and it provided the impetus for the present study. Genes homologous to bovine p64 are expressed in rat tissues, including brain (18Howell S. Duncan R.R. Ashley R.H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, p64-expressed sequence tags have been identified in several tissues during the Human Genome Mapping Project. In an attempt to identify p64-related intracellular Cl− channel proteins in mammalian brain, we used a PCR-based approach to clone and functionally express a rat brain homologue of p64, p64H1. This is the first putative intracellular Cl− channel component to be identified in brain, and we suggest that p64- andp64H1-related genes encode a family of proteins associated with intracellular Cl− transport. RT-PCR was carried out on whole rat brain total RNA (19Chomszinski P. Sattchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar) using two fully degenerate oligonucleotide primers (18Howell S. Duncan R.R. Ashley R.H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) based on the amino acid sequence of bovine kidney p64 (Ref. 17Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A.

We used the random primer method to label a 346-bp EcoRI fragment of BS2, a partial cDNA clone generated by this procedure, with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham). This probe was used to screen an oligo(dT)-primed rat olfactory bulb λZAP II cDNA library (Stratagene) at moderate stringency (6 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 65 °C). We isolated 13 clones after washing the filters at moderate stringency (final wash: 2 × SSPE, 65 °C, 30 min), and phagemid DNA was rescued according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing was carried out using the Sequenase II system (Amersham). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from rat brain total RNA using Poly(A)+ Quick columns (Stratagene). 10 pmol of an antisense oligonucleotide (5′-CGGTGGTGACACTGAACACGACTCC-3′, based on sequence analysis of the longest cDNA clone) were used to direct first-strand cDNA synthesis from 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA by 10 units of Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Inc.). The RNA template was destroyed by alkaline hydrolysis, and the cDNA was circularized by incubation with 10 units of T4 RNA ligase (NEB). This was used as a template in a PCR with the following oligonucleotides: forward primer, 5′-TGCAGTTTCCTATGCTCTCACCATC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCACAGAGGCTCTTCATGATCCTTT-3′. The PCR product (cRI) was ligated to the T/A cloning vector pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced (Sequenase II, Amersham). cRI extended an additional 120 bp farther upstream from the original RT-PCR clone, and this was used to screen a second rat whole brain cDNA library (λgt10 5′ STRETCH,CLONTECH) under conditions identical to those previously described. The 1.9-kb insert from the newly isolated clone (p64H1) was PCR-amplified using λgt10 insert-flanking primers (forward primer, 5′-AGCAAGTTCAGCCTGGTTAAGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTATGAGTATTTCTTCCAGGG-3′); and a polymerase mixture ofTaq and Pwo (Extend, Boehringer Mannheim). The final product was ligated to pTAg (R&D Systems). 3 μg of tissue-specific poly(A)+ RNAs purified from total tissue RNAs were electrophoresed in a 1% (w/v) agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to Hybond-N (Amersham), and cross-linked in a Stratalinker UV oven (Stratagene). We also used a commercial rat multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH). A 346-bp EcoRI restriction fragment of BS2 labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, as described earlier, was hybridized to the membranes and washed under conditions of high (final wash: 0.2 × SSPE, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 65 °C for 10 min) or moderate (final wash: 2 × SSPE, 65 °C for 30 min) stringency and exposed to radiographic film for 24 h. Freshly dissected brains from adult Harlan Sprague Dawley rats were slowly frozen on dry ice and mounted on the cutting block of a cryostat using Tissue Tek (Miles Laboratories). 15–20-μm sections were cut at −14 °C and thaw-mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated slides, fixed by immersion for 5 min in ice-cold 4% (w/v) phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde, rinsed in 1 × PBS, and dehydrated in 70% (v/v), 80% (v/v), and 95% (v/v) ethanol. Following fixation, the sections were rehydrated in 1 × PBS and immersed for 10 min at room temperature in a solution containing 0.25% (v/v) acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 8.0), 0.9% (w/v) NaCl (21Young W.S.

After dehydration through graded alcohols, the sections were dipped in chloroform for 5 min then dehydrated again. A probe was synthesized by end-labeling 5 ng of a 45-mer antisense oligonucleotide (5′-CCTTTTCAGGTCAACGGTGGTGACACTGAACACGACTCCTTTGAG-3′) with α-35S-dATP (1200 Ci/mmol, 12.5 mCi/μl, Amersham) using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeling was confirmed by electrophoresing an aliquot in a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 6.6 m urea. This probe was diluted 100-fold in a hybridization buffer containing 50% (v/v) formamide, 4 × SSC, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 0.25% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate, 5 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 200 μg/ml yeast total RNA, and 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA and hybridized to the sections for 16 h at 42 °C in a chamber humidified with 50% (v/v) formamide, 2 × SSC. The sections were washed twice for 20 min in 2 × SSC at 22 °C then twice for 20 min in 2 × SSC at 55 °C. They were then rinsed in 0.3 × SSC, 70% (v/v) ethanol at 22 °C and dehydrated in 95% (v/v) ethanol before being exposed to radiographic film for 10 days. A complementary sense 45-mer probe was used as a negative control. A 1.5-kb cDNA insert in pTAg (R&D Systems) encoding the complete open reading frame of p64H1was used to direct protein translation in a coupled in vitrotranscription/translation system (TnT, Promega). The insert contained 165 bp of 5′-UTR and ∼500 bp of 3′-UTR. The reaction was initiated from the T7 promotor of pTAg in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega), labeling the protein with [α-35S]methionine (0.8 mCi/ml; specific activity, 1,016 Ci/mmol, Amersham), which was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The translation product (5 μl or the equivalent after treatment) was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To treat the translation product at high pH, the microsomes were incubated on ice in 10 volumes of 100 mmNa2CO3 (pH 11.5) for 30 min, pelleted by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), and rinsed with 10 volumes of ice-cold PBS (22Gilmore R. Blobel G. Cell. 1985; 42: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) before electrophoresis. For proteolysis, 10 μl of the translation product were incubated with proteinase K (10 mg/ml, Sigma) at 0 °C in the presence or absence of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The digestion products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 6% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels using Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (23Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). HEK-293 and HT-4 (24Frederiksen K. Jat P.S. Valtz N. Levy D. McKay R. Neuron. 1988; 1: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies). Cells were exposed to humidified air supplemented with 5% (v/v) CO2and routinely passaged between 60–70% confluency using 0.05% (w/v) trypsin, 0.53 m EDTA. All transfections were performed using the same cell line between passage numbers 15–25 (HEK-293) or 4–6 (HT-4). The p64H1 insert used for in vitrotranslation was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI (Promega) downstream of the vector's cytomegalovirus IE promotor sequence. Its orientation was verified by sequencing and by demonstrating the continued ability of the construct to direct protein synthesis from the T7 promotor in a coupled transcription/translation system. Cells were transiently transfected in 100-mm culture dishes at 50% confluency using either 1 ml of calcium phosphate DNA precipitate containing 20 μg of plasmid DNA prepared using standard methods or Tfx-20 (Promega). p64H1 expression was confirmed by immunoblotting after 48–72 h (see below). Negative control transfections were performed in an identical manner using vector alone as a source of DNA. To analyze expressed products in planar lipid bilayers, cells were harvested from transfected or control plates by scraping into cold buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.32m sucrose, 0.1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor and homogenized on ice using 25 strokes of a Teflon glass homogenizer. The homogenates were fractionated by differential centrifugation to yield microsomal membranes, which were either used immediately or snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −70 °C for up to 6 weeks. We previously reported the generation of a polyclonal antiserum (Ab990) to a fusion protein containing a fragment of p64H1 (18Howell S. Duncan R.R. Ashley R.H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and this was used to detect p64H1 after in vitro translation. Briefly, proteins were transferred onto Hybond-C (Amersham), and excess binding sites were blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in a solution containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) TTBS). Membranes were exposed to polyclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution in TBS) for 60 min, washed with TTBS, and exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:4000 dilution in TBS, Pierce). Membranes were washed extensively with TTBS, and bound antibody complexes were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Transfected HEK-293 and HT-4 cells were grown to subconfluency on sterile glass coverslips. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed extensively in ice-cold PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+, fixed for 20 min in ice-cold buffered paraformaldehyde, and washed again in PBS. p64H1 was detected using a 1:50 dilution of antiserum (18Howell S. Duncan R.R. Ashley R.H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) in PBS, 0.2% (v/v) fish skin gelatin (Sigma). After extensive washing, the primary antibody was detected using rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG second antibody (1:100 dilution in PBS, 0.2% (v/v) fish skin gelatin). Nuclear DNA was stained using Hoechst 33258 dye, and ER membranes were visualized using the short chain cationic dicarbocyanine DiO-C5-(3), similar to 3′,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (25Terasaki M. Song J. Wong J.R. Weiss M.J. Chen L.B. Cell. 1984; 38: 101-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 26Terasaki M. Reese T.S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 315-322PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were mounted and examined at magnifications of up to × 400 under oil immersion. Images were obtained with a Hamamatsu C5810 chilled color CCD camera using standard Nikon filter cubes. Negative controls, using pre-immune serum from the same animal, showed no p64H1-specific staining. Planar lipid bilayers (27) comprising equimolar palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine and palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylserine (each 15 mg/ml, Avanti) suspended inn-decane, were cast at room temperature across a polystyrene partition separating two solutions containing 50 mm choline chloride, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Microsomal membrane vesicles were added to the cis chamber (final concentration, ∼1 μg of protein/ml), which was voltage-clamped relative to thetrans chamber using a Biologic RK-300 patch-clamp amplifier. Membrane vesicles were induced to fuse at 0 mV by adding 2 mm Ca2+ and 450 mm choline chloride to the cis chamber with constant stirring (2Ashley R.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The contents of the cis and trans chambers were changed by perfusion after channel incorporation (see “Results”), and transmembrane currents were low-pass-filtered (up to 1.0 kHz, −3 decibel point, 8-pole Bessel) and digitally recorded at various holding potentials (sampling at 10 kHz). Previous work has suggested that noninverted rather than inverted brain ER vesicles fuse with bilayers (2Ashley R.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) so that a net flux of Cl− flowing cis totrans through incorporated channels represents a negative outward current flowing from cytoplasm to lumen. The signs of the voltage-clamp potential (measured as cis minustrans or cytoplasmic minus luminal potential) and the membrane currents conform to the standard electrophysiological convention. Current/voltage relationships were plotted after current amplitude histogram analysis (pClamp 6, Axon Instruments) to measure single-channel slope conductances and reversal potentials. The relative permeabilities (P) of monovalent anions versusmonovalent cations were calculated from reversal potentials measured in asymmetric ionic conditions (e.g. 2, 11) or by directly fitting data to the GHK current equation (28Hodgkin A.L. Katz B. J. Physiol. 1949; 108: 27-77Crossref Scopus (1787) Google Scholar). Junction potentials were insignificant (11Hayman K.A. Spurway T.S. Ashley R.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). p64 was identified as a Cl− channel component in bovine kidney (15Landry D.W. Reitman M. Cragoe E.R. Al-Awqati Q. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 90: 779-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Landry D.W. Akabas M.H. Redhead C. Edelman A. Cragoe E.J. Al-Awqati Q.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we used RT-PCR and cDNA library screening to clone cDNAs encoding p64-related Cl− channels from rat brain. Sequence analysis revealed that none of the original 13 clones isolated by this approach (see “Experimental Procedures”) contained full-length cDNA inserts. Many of the cDNAs contained long 3′-UTR sequences, and computer analysis predicted extensive RNA secondary structure (Genetics Computer Group 8, University of Wisconsin). This probably reduced the abundance of full-length p64H1cDNAs when the original library was constructed. To overcome these problems, we used circle (or concatemer) rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR (20Muruyama I.N. Rakow T.L. Muruyama H.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3796-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) to extend the partial-length cDNAs obtained by conventional library screening toward the 5′-end of thep64H1 transcript. This technique, briefly described under “Experimental Procedures,” produced the probe cRI and, eventually,p64H1. Sequence analysis of two independent PCR clones ofp64H1 revealed 100% identity to BS2 and cRI, and the presence of a methionine codon in a consensus region favorable for translation, viz. GGCCATGG (29Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar, 30Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar). This single potential-initiating methionine codon was followed by a 753-bp open reading frame encoding a protein with a predictedM r of 28,635. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of p64H1 and p64H1 are shown in Fig.1 A. The clone also contained 165 bp of 5′-UTR (as shown). The same cDNA was obtained when another cDNA library was screened with the 5′-UTR sequence. There were two in-frame termination codons within the 5′-UTR, and the other reading frames contained multiple termination codons (not shown). Partial p64H1 cDNA clones obtained by screening an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library contained unusually long 3′-UTR sequences of ∼3.9 kb.Figure 1cDNA and protein sequences.

Note that p64H1 is only about half the length of p64. Anarrow indicates the hydrophobic region corresponding to the predicted transmembrane domain of p64H1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig.1 B shows an optimized alignment of the predicted 253 amino acid residues of p64H1 with bovine p64. p64H1 showed 71% identity to the C-terminal portion of p64 (which has an additional 226 N-terminal residues) and appeared to have a single potential membrane-spanning region, which was predicted to adopt an alpha-helical conformation (31Rost B. Fariselli P. Casadio R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The hydropathy profile of p64H1 closely resembled the C-terminal half of p64 (Fig. 1 C). There were no consensusN-glycosylation sites, but p64H1 had multiple consensus sites for phosphorylation by a variety of kinases. These included a single protein kinase A (PKA) site and four protein kinase C (PKC) sites (indicated in Fig. 1 A). The putative transmembrane domain was preceded by a relatively short N-terminal domain, but this had no similarity to published cleaved signal peptide sequences, and sequence analysis did not predict a protease cleavage site. Finally, data base searching revealed no similarity to any other protein apart from bovine p64 and other p64-related proteins. Northern blot analysis at moderate stringency using a 346-bp probe derived from p64H1 cDNA revealed three transcripts of approximately 1.9 kb, 4.8 kb, and 6.5 kb in samples from whole rat brain (Fig. 2 A). At higher stringency, the p64H1 transcript hybridized exclusively to the 4.8-kb species (Fig. 2 B). The 1.9-kb and 6.5-kb transcripts may represent related members of a gene family or result from alternative mRNA splicing. The 4.8-kb transcript was detected in RNA from several rat tissues, indicating thatp64H1 is widely expressed (Fig. 2 B). Based on these results, we further localized p64H1 expression in rat brain by in situ mRNA hybridization. Marked expression was observed in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and dentate gyrus, and moderate expression was observed in the cerebral cortex (Fig.2 C). No signal was detected in parallel experiments using a sense probe or in samples treated with RNase (not shown). We expressed p64H1 in vitro to confirm the location of the initiating methionine and to delineate the protein membrane topology. The M r of p64H1 was unaltered in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Fig.3 A), consistent with the lack of predicted consensus glycosylation sites. Microsomes containing recombinant p64H1 were incubated at high pH to lyse the membrane vesicles and dissociate peripheral membrane proteins. This treatment failed to dissociate the translation product (Fig. 3 A,lane 4), consistent with an integral membrane protein (32Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell. Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar,33Feng G. Deak P. Chopra M. Hall L.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 1001-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Intact microsomes containing recombinant p64H1 were also exposed to proteinase K to determine how much of the protein was accessible to an extravesicular protease. As shown in Fig. 3 B, this reduced the apparent M r of the in vitro translation product by ∼27,000, whereas solubilization of the microsomal membranes with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (not shown) allowed complete digestion. The bands containing unincorporated label are an artifact of the Tris-Tricine gels used to resolve the lowM r (∼6,000) peptide. Finally, we demonstrated that PKC phosphorylated p64H1 in vitro. This increased the apparent M r of the protein by up to ∼10,000 (Fig. 3 C), with a ladder of phosphorylated proteins consistent with multiple phosphorylation states (four PKC sites could theoretically give rise to 42 − 1 = 15 different phosphoproteins). To determine the cellular location of p64H1, we transiently transfected HEK-293 cells and the mouse neuronal cell line HT-4 with an expression vector containing p64H1. We detected p64H1 with an apparentM r of ∼33,000 after 48 h using an anti-p64H1 polyclonal antiserum (Ab990). The protein was localized to the P3 membrane fraction, which is known to be enriched in ER but also contains other membranes including Golgi and plasma"
https://openalex.org/W1994539200,"We demonstrate that human activating transcription factor 4 (hATF4), a member of the activating transcription factor/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (ATF/CREB) family of transcription factors, is a potent transcriptional activator in both mammalian cells and yeast. The N-terminal 113 amino acids of hATF4 activate transcription efficiently, and unexpectedly, the C-terminal bZip DNA binding domain of hATF4 also activates transcription, albeit weakly. Our results indicate that hATF4 interacts with several general transcription factors: TATA-binding protein, TFIIB, and the RAP30 subunit of TFIIF. In addition, hATF4 interacts with the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) at four regions: 1) the KIX domain, 2) a region that contains the third zinc finger and the E1A-interacting domain, 3) a C-terminal region that contains the p160/SRC-1-interacting domain, and 4) the recently identified histone acetyltransferase domain. Interestingly, both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of hATF4 interact with the above general transcription factors and CBP, providing a mechanistic explanation for their ability to activate transcription. Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP potentiates the ability of hATF4 to activate transcription. The potential significance of the interaction between hATF4 and multiple factors is discussed.

Therefore, CBP/p300 functions as a target for a variety of proteins involved in different regulatory circuits, allowing cells to coordinate or integrate signals from different pathways. Consequently, it has been suggested that it be named an “integrator” (14Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Montminy M. Evans R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms by which CBP/p300 functions as a coactivator remain to be determined, the current understanding suggests several possibilities. One possibility is that it acts as an adapter between the sequence-specific transcriptional activators and GTFs such as TBP (22Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 33Abraham S.E. Lobo S. Yaciuk P. Wang H.G. Moran E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2373-2375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that CBP/p300 enhances the acetylation of histones; this presumably destabilizes the nucleosome and facilitates access of DNA by regulatory factors (for reviews see Refs. 35Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar and 36Wolffe A.P. Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that CBP/p300 can enhance acetylation of histones by at least two mechanisms; it has an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (37Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar, 38Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar), and it recruits P/CAF, which also has HAT activity (39Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J.-I. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that human ATF4 (hATF4), a member of the ATF/CRE family of proteins, also interacts with CBP/p300. Binding sites for this family of proteins are present in many cellular and viral promoters (for a review see Ref. 40Sassone-Corsi P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 355-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), suggesting an involvement of this family of proteins in the regulation of many genes. A partial cDNA clone of hATF4 was originally isolated by its ability to bind to the consensus ATF/CRE site (41Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The full-length clone was later isolated and named as TAXREB67 (42Tsujimoto A. Nyunoya H. Morita T. Sato T. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1420-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or CREB2 (43Karpinski B.A. Morle G.D. Huggenvik J. Uhler M.D. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4820-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, the term “CREB2” was also used to refer to CRE-BP1/ATF2 (44Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 295-302PubMed Google Scholar) and an alternatively spliced form of CREB that lacks 14 amino acids (45Yoshimura T. Fujisawa J.I. Yoshida M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 46Willems L. Kettmann R. Chen G. Portetelle D. Burny A. Derse D. DNA Seq. 1991; 1: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Therefore, to avoid confusion, we will refer to the human clone as hATF4 in the rest of this report. Three mouse cDNAs, mATF4 (47Mielnicki L.M. Pruitt S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), mTR67 (48Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), and C/ATF (49Vallejo M. Ron D. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4679-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), share over 90% identity to hATF4 (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, ATF4 represents a group of conserved proteins. Interestingly, all ATF4 proteins have a second zipper in addition to the C-terminal leucine zipper (Fig. 1 A). It is not clear, however, whether this second zipper is functionally important. Although all ATF4 proteins are bZip proteins, the only similarity they share with CREB (50Hoeffler J.P. Meyer T.E. Yun Y. Jameson J.L. Habener J.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1430-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 51Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fischer W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs III, W. Vale W.W. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1989; 337: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) and other ATF proteins is the conserved residues in the basic region and the conserved leucine residues in the leucine zipper (for reviews see Refs. 40Sassone-Corsi P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 355-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar and 52Hurst H.C. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 123-168PubMed Google Scholar). In the rest of the bZip domain and outside of the bZip domain, ATF4 proteins are completely different from CREB and other ATF proteins. Therefore, the names of various ATF proteins reflect more the history of discovery rather than the similarities between them. Thus far, the physiological functions of ATF4 proteins have not been defined. Tissue distribution of ATF4 mRNA demonstrated that it is present in most tissues or cell lines examined, revealing little clues about its physiological functions. In this context, it is interesting to note that aplysia CREB2/ATF4 (ApCREB2/ATF4), which has been demonstrated to repress long term facilitation (53Bartsch D. Ghirardi M. Skehel P.A. Karl K.A. Herder S.P. Chen M. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 979-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), is 50% identical to hATF4 in the bZip domain and has a second zipper (Fig.1 B). However, it is not clear whether the mammalian ATF4 plays a similar role. In this report, we show that hATF4 is a strong activator in both mammalian cells and yeast. It interacts with several GTFs and with the coactivator CBP at multiple domains including the recently identified HAT domain. N-terminal and C-terminal deletion constructs of hATF4 were generated by ExoIII deletion. GAL4 fusions were generated by placing GAL4 DNA binding domain at either the N or C terminus of various hATF4 fragments, and the resulting fusions are indicated as GAL4-hATF4 or hATF4-GAL4, respectively. To express the proteins, various DNA fragments were cloned into appropriate expression vectors: pCG (from W. Herr) for mammalian cells, pTM1 (from B. Moss) for reticulocyte translation, pGBT-9 (from S. Fields) for yeast expression, and pET-His (54Chen B.P.C. Hai T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 139: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) for expression in Escherichia coli. Yeast strain Y190 (from S. J.

Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). Yeast transformation and the β-galactosidase assay were carried out according to standard protocols (56Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual.

Academic Press, New York1991Google Scholar). Cell culture, calcium phosphate transfection, and CAT assays were performed as described previously (58Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transfection, unless otherwise indicated, 1.5 μg of reporter DNA and 0.5 μg of effector DNA expressing the indicated proteins were used for each 60-mm plate of cells. Appropriate amounts of pGEM3 carrier DNA were included to make a total 7 μg of DNA for each transfection. hATF4 tagged with six contiguous histidines was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3/LysS) (from F. W. Studier) according to Studier et al. (59Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar) and purified at 4 °C as follows. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold 1 m bZip buffer (1 mNaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 5% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing various protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1m sodium metabisulfite, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). The high concentration of NaCl appears to increase the solubility of hATF4. Tween 20 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the cell suspension was lysed by sonication on ice. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatant was separated from the cell debris and mixed with Ni2+ nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) that had been preequilibrated in 1 m bZip buffer. After gentle rocking for 1 h, the beads were packed into column and washed with two column volumes of 1 m bZip buffer, two column volumes of 0.3 m bZip buffer (same as 1 m bZip except NaCl was 0.3 m), and five column volumes of 0.3m bZip buffer containing 25 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with 0.3 m bZip buffer containing 0.5m imidazole and dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1m sodium metabisulfite. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad assay, and bovine serum albumin was added, if necessary, to make the final protein concentration 1 mg/ml. In vitro transcription was carried out using primer extension as described previously (60Hai T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The CAT primer 5′-GCCATTGGGATATATCAACGG-3′ is complementary to the region from +29 to +49 of the CAT mRNA. Nuclear extracts were made from HeLa cells according to Dignam et al. (61Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). pTM1 derivatives encoding the indicated proteins were transcribed by T7 polymerase and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. E. colicells expressing the indicated GST fusion proteins were collected and resuspended in ice-cold 1 m TED buffer (1 mKCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 m sodium metabisulfite, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and the cell suspension was sonicated on ice. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was separated from the cell debris. Aliquots were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Each aliquot (0.25–1 ml, depending on the levels of expression) of the frozen supernatant was thawed and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 10 μl of glutathione-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) that had been prewashed in 1 m TED buffer, and the unbound proteins were removed by washes in GST binding buffer (100 mm KCl, 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 msodium metabisulfite, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). The resulting glutathione-agarose beads bound with the fusion protein were used in the binding assay immediately. The beads were incubated with the indicated 35S-labeled proteins at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of GST binding buffer for 1 h to allow binding and washed with GST binding buffer for three times (4 °C, 5 min each time). The bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads with 20 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis. The GST fusion proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue stain, and the labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. To examine the function of hATF4, we transfected HeLa cells with pCG-hATF4, which expresses hATF4, and a CAT reporter driven by tandem ATF sites. As shown in Fig.2 A, overexpression of hATF4 activated the reporter more than 150-fold. This activity can be transferred to a heterologous DNA binding domain, the GAL4 DNA binding domain. A plasmid expressing the hATF4-GAL4 fusion protein activated the CAT reporter driven by tandem GAL4 sites. The -fold activation ranged from approximately 60 (Fig. 4) to 700 (Fig.3), depending on the amount of DNA used (10 and 500 ng, respectively). This activity was comparable with that of GAL4-VP16 (data not shown), a well characterized, strong viral activator. Although the DNA binding domain of hATF4 is at its C terminus, the orientation of fusion does not significantly affect the activity (data not shown). Therefore, fusion proteins with either orientation were used in this study. In the rest of this report, “GAL4-hATF4” refers to fusion proteins with a GAL4 DNA binding domain at the N terminus, and “hATF4-GAL4” refers to fusion proteins with a GAL4 DNA binding domain at the C terminus.Figure 4The N-terminal 113 amino acids of hATF4 function as a potent activator. The CAT reporter driven by tandem GAL4 sites was transfected into HeLa cells with 10 ng of pCG or pCG derivatives, producing the indicated hATF4-GAL4 fusion proteins. The fold of activation by hATF4 is calculated by defining the reporter activity in the presence of pCG as 1. The activity of hATF4-(1–339) is then defined as 100%. This construct lacks the last 12 amino acids of hATF4 (to remove the termination codon) and has an activity comparable with that of the full-length hATF4 with GAL4 fused at its N terminus (data not shown). The result is the average of five experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Both the N- and the C-terminal regions of hATF4 contain a transcriptional activation domain. A, the N-terminal region is important for the function of hATF4. The CAT reporter driven by three tandem ATF sites was transfected into HeLa cells with pCG vector or pCG derivatives producing the indicated hATF4 proteins. The fold of activation by each derivative is calculated by defining the reporter activity in the presence of pCG as 1. The relative activity is calculated by defining the activity of the full-length hATF4 as 100%. The result is the average of five experiments. B, the bZip region of hATF4 has transcriptional activity when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The CAT reporter driven by five tandem GAL4 sites was transfected into HeLa cells with pCG vector or pCG derivatives, producing the indicated fusion proteins. The fold of activation and the relative activity are calculated as inpanel A. The result is the average of five experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the CAT reporters used above were driven by artificial promoters, we asked whether ATF4 can activate transcription from naturally occurring promoters. We examined the following promoters containing functional ATF or ATF-like sites: adenovirus E4, E-selectin, proenkephalin (ENK), HTLV-1, somatostatin (SOM), and tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) promoters (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2 A, hATF4 activated all of these promoters, ranging from a few to 50-fold. The fold of activation was not as high as that observed on the artificial promoter, possibly because the natural promoters contain binding sites for other transcription factors and have higher basal transcriptional activity, leading to less activation; alternatively, the activation may be lower because hATF4 does not interact well with other factors on the promoters and consequently does not activate the promoter efficiently. To test whether the ability of hATF4 to activate transcription can be recapitulated in vitro, we examined its activity by anin vitro transcription assay. As shown in Fig.2 B, hATF4 activated transcription from a promoter containing tandem ATF sites in a dose-dependent manner. However, when hATF4 was added at a high concentration, the activity of the promoter started to decrease (Fig. 2 B, last lane), presumably because hATF4 sequestered factors/co-factors away from the promoter at high concentrations, a phenomenon commonly referred to as “squelching” (62Gill G. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 334: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Because many mammalian transcription factors can function in yeast, we examined whether hATF4 also activates transcription in yeast. We took a GAL4 fusion approach to avoid potential interference from the endogenous yeast ATF-related proteins (63Nojima H. Leem S.-H. Araki H. Sakai A. Nakashima N. Kanaoka Y. Ono Y. Nucl. Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5279-5288Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 64Vincent A.C. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5394-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 65Nehlin J.O.

The activation by GAL4-hATF4 was comparable with that by the full-length GAL4, a well characterized yeast activator, indicating that hATF4 can function as a potent activator in yeast. In summary, we demonstrate that hATF4 can activate transcription in a mammalian system both in vivoand in vitro; in addition, it functions as a potent transcriptional activator in yeast. To examine whether hATF4 contains discrete transcriptional activation domains, we made a series of N- and C-terminal deletions and examined their activities by transfection. Fig. 3 A shows the results of the N-terminal deletions. Deletion of the first N-terminal 22 amino acids (ΔN22) abolished 80% of the activity. Experiments in yeast using GAL4 fusion proteins showed a comparable result (Fig.2 C), indicating that the first 22 amino acids are import"

This COOH-terminal segment is not required for activity, for oligomerization, or for the critical cell cycle function of Cdc14p. Genetic analyses of temperature-sensitive CDC mutants as well as biochemical studies using Xenopus oocytes have revealed that reversible protein phosphorylation is a major mechanism for regulating cell cycle progression (1Nasmyth K. Science. 1996; 274: 1643-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Transitions in the cell cycle are coordinated by changes in the activity of kinases and phosphatases and in the phosphorylation state of their target proteins. CDC genes as well as a number of other genes that have been linked to cell cycle progression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae encode protein kinases or protein phosphatases.The CDC14 gene (2Wan J. Xu H. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11274-11280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may encode a protein phosphatase, since the predicted sequence contains the highly conserved HCXAGXXR(S/T) motif that is located in the active site of enzymes from the protein tyrosine phosphatase family (3Denu J.M.

To date, the enzymatic properties of Cdc14p have not been studied, and the existence of intrinsic phosphatase activity has not been directly demonstrated. The CDC14 gene is essential (2Wan J. Xu H. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11274-11280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and at restrictive temperatures, cells carrying a thermosensitive mutation in the CDC14 gene arrest in late mitosis with elongated mitotic spindles and a single bud (6Wood J.S. Hartwell L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Homozygous cdc14 mutants exhibit defects in meiosis and, depending on when they are switched to restrictive temperatures, arrest in either meiosis I or meiosis II (7Schild D. Byers B. Genetics. 1980; 96: 859-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The precise cell cycle function(s) of Cdc14p is unknown. However, several genetic studies suggest that Cdc14p may be involved in initiating DNA replication (8Loo S. Fox C.A. Rine J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Bell S. Mol. Biol.

For instance, the combination ofcdc14-1 and orc2–1 mutations is lethal. TheORC2 gene encodes one of the six subunits of the origin of replication complex, which binds in an ATP-dependent manner to yeast origins and is required for initiation of DNA replication (12Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar,13Stillman B. Science. 1996; 274: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Their synthetic lethality indicates that Orc2p and Cdc14p act in a common pathway or process. The terminal phenotype of cdc14mutants suggests that the CDC14 gene may also execute a function required for completing mitosis (6Wood J.S. Hartwell L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 176-185PubMed Google Scholar). Cdc14p may carry out two distinct functions during the cell cycle, one required for initiation of replication and one necessary for completing mitosis. Alternatively, a single Cdc14p-dependent event may be required for progression through mitosis and initiation of replication (8Loo S. Fox C.A. Rine J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Bell S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 9Hardy C.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1832-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).As a first step toward identifying its cell cycle function and understanding its regulation, we have expressed Cdc14p inEscherichia coli for biochemical characterization. Our reexamination of the CDC14 gene sequence has confirmed several errors in the original sequence (2Wan J. Xu H. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11274-11280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that when corrected result in a larger predicted open reading frame encoding a 62-kDa protein. We demonstrate herein that Cdc14p is an oligomeric, dual specificity phosphatase that is completely dependent on an active site cysteine for activity. We have shown that its phosphatase activity is required for its cell cycle function and have also found that the Asn/Ser-rich COOH-terminal domain is not required for activity, for oligomerization, or for the critical cell cycle function executed by Cdc14p.RESULTSData from this study (Fig. 1), the yeast genome sequencing project, 2Cherry, J. M., Adler, C., Ball, C., Dwight, S., Chervitz, S., Jia, Y., Juvik, G., Weng, S., and Botstein, D. (April 1997) Saccharomyces Genome Database,http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/. and several other laboratories (14Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Mol. Gen.

Murakami Y. Yeast. 1996; 12: 177-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have confirmed that the original nucleotide sequence (GenBankTMM61194) reported for theCDC14 gene (2Wan J. Xu H. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11274-11280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains several errors. The sequence (GenBankTMD50617) reported by Eki et al. (34Eki T. Naitou M. Hagiwara H. Abe M. Ozawa M. Sasanuma S. Sasanuma M. Tsuchiya Y. Shibata T. Watanabe K. Ono A. Yamazaki M. Tashiro H. Hanaoka F. Murakami Y. Yeast. 1996; 12: 177-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is identical to that reported here. The sequence (GenBankTMD55715) of Shirayama et al. (14Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 176-185PubMed Google Scholar) differs in having a C in place of G at position +352 in Fig. 1, which results in substitution of Pro for Ala at amino acid residue 118. This difference may be attributed to allelic variation.The corrected sequence contains an open reading frame that is much larger than that originally reported (2Wan J. Xu H. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11274-11280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, theCDC14 gene contains a 1653-bp open reading frame that encodes a protein of 551 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 61,906 Da and a calculated pI of 8.0. Sequences adjacent to the putative initiator codon give a good match to the consensus sequence thought to be required for efficient translation initiation in yeast (35Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The location of the putative ATG start codon at a site where 20 of the 30 upstream nucleotides are adenines is not uncommon for yeast genes, which frequently contain A-rich 5′-leader sequences (35Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The sequence, TATAAT, located at −63 to −58, fits the consensus for eukaryotic TATA boxes that typically precede the transcription start site by 20–30 nucleotides. The length of the deduced protein sequence is consistent with the size (1.9 kb) of the CDC14 transcript previously determined by Northern analysis (2Wan J. Xu H. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11274-11280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The sequence, HCKAGLGRTG, located at residues 282–291 of Cdc14p (Fig.1), fits the consensus sequence, HCXAGXXR(S/T), found at the active site of all protein tyrosine phosphatases (3Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 4Tonks N.K. Neel B.G.

Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This phosphatase superfamily can be divided into distinct subfamilies, those that are tyrosine-specific and those that exhibit dual specificity because they are also capable of hydrolyzing phosphoserine/threonine residues. Aside from a 20-residue segment encompassing the active site motif, data base searches reveal that Cdc14p exhibits little similarity to the tyrosine-specific phosphatases and does not contain the 240-residue conserved domain that is found in this group of enzymes (3Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 4Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Previous sequence comparisons (25Sheng Z. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4728-4733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that Cdc14p might be a dual specificity enzyme because it is most closely related to BVP, a dual specificity protein phosphatase encoded by an insect virus.The schematic diagram in Fig. 1 B illustrates the structural organization of Cdc14p. Sequence alignments (25Sheng Z. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4728-4733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with BVP and two other closely related homologs suggest that there is a 170-residue core structure that contains the highly conserved active site. Like most other protein tyrosine phosphatases, the catalytic core appears to be flanked by N- and COOH-terminal noncatalytic segments that exhibit no significant similarities to sequences of known proteins. The sequence 375–551 from the COOH terminus of Cdc14p has several notable features including an unusually high content of Asn (13.6 mol %) and Ser (15.3 mol %) residues and a large net positive charge (calculated pI = 10.1). As shown in Fig. 1 C, the basic, Asn/Ser-rich COOH-terminal segment contains two internally homologous 21-residue repeats (33% sequence identity) located at residues 400–420 and 423–443. The structural and/or functional significance of these tandem repeats is unknown.Detection of Endogenous Cdc14p in S. cerevisiaeEndogenously expressed Cdc14p was detected in asynchronous cultures of a protease-deficient strain of yeast (BJ5465) using anti-Cdc14p antibodies. Immunoprecipitates prepared from crude cell lysates were separated on SDS gels and immunoblotted using affinity-purified anti-Cdc14p antibodies. As shown in Fig.2, a single cross-reactive band with a mobility identical to that of recombinant Cdc14p was observed in yeast cell extracts. The identity in size of the recombinant and endogenous enzymes is fully consistent with the assignment of the start codon and the size of the open reading frame deduced from the nucleotide sequence shown in Fig. 1.Figure 2Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Cdc14p from yeast. Cdc14p was immunoprecipitated from a soluble extract of yeast strain (BJ5465) using polyclonal rabbit anti-Cdc14p antibodies or preimmune serum.

As shown in Fig.3, lane 2, isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induced the expression of protein with an apparent molecular weight of 90,000, which is in agreement with the calculated value of 90,359. Nearly all of the fusion protein was recovered in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3, lane 4) of bacterial lysates, yielding approximately 15 mg/liter of culture. After glutathione-agarose affinity purification, the yield of GST-Cdc14p was about 5 mg/liter of culture (Fig. 3, lane 5). Affinity-purified GST-Cdc14p was subjected to Mono Q FPLC ion exchange chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures” to reduce the level of a contaminant identified as GST by immunoblotting and to remove a significant quantity of bacterial nucleic acids that were not eliminated by affinity purification (Fig. 3, lane 6). To ensure complete removal of nucleic acid from the protein used for the size and subunit analyses described below, bacterial lysates were also treated with polyethyleneimine prior to affinity purification.Figure 3Expression and purification of recombinant GST-Cdc14p and Cdc14p.

As shown in TableI, GST-Cdc14p also dephosphorylated the peptide substrates, Tyr(P)-RRsrc and Tyr(P)-Raytide, but not Ser(P)-Kemptide. The pH optimum for these protein/peptide substrates was 6.6. The commonly used artificial protein substrate, Tyr(P)-RCML, was also dephosphorylated, but the time course of the reaction was biphasic (data not shown) with a rapid, nonlinear release of phosphate followed by a slower linear phase with a rate of 0.5 nmol/min/mg. This time course resembled pre-steady state burst kinetics, which suggests that release of the dephospho-RCML product could be rate-limiting, but proof must await a more detailed kinetic analysis.Figure 4Dual specificity phosphatase activity of GST-Cdc14p.

The 140-fold higher k cat/K m value measured for the T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase3 is typical of the tyrosine-specific enzymes, most of which havek cat/K m values at least 2–3 orders of magnitude larger than those of the dual specificity enzymes (39Gottlin E.B.

Adv. Enzymol. 1994; 68: 1-36PubMed Google Scholar).Cdc14p was separated from GST by thrombin cleavage to compare the activities of the carrier-free recombinant enzyme and the fusion protein. Enzyme generated by thrombin cleavage is herein designated as rCdc14p to denote that it contains four NH2-terminal residues (GSGS) not found in the native protein. When expressed on a molar basis, the activities of rCdc14p and the fusion protein toward pNPP were nearly identical (data not shown). In contrast, the activity of rCdc14p toward both Tyr(P)- and Ser/Thr(P)-MBP was about 1.6-fold higher than that for the fusion protein (data not shown), indicating that presence of GST at its NH2 terminus reduces the activity of rCdc14p toward protein substrates by about one-third.GST-Cdc14p C283S, a mutant in which the Cys located within the putative active site region was replaced by Ser, exhibited no detectable activity with all substrates that were tested (Table I). The lack of activity with this mutant shows that Cys283 is essential for activity and confirms that the observed phosphatase activity is catalyzed by GST-Cdc14p rather than a contaminating bacterial enzyme. These results demonstrate that Cdc14p is capable of dephosphorylating phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine residues and is a dual specificity phosphatase.Effect of Salt Concentration on ActivityThe activity of GST-Cdc14p is highly sensitive to ionic strength. Increasing NaCl concentration results in the reduction of activity toward both pNPP and protein substrates (data not shown). At 170 mm NaCl, phosphatase activity with pNPP and Tyr(P)-MBP was about 50% of that measured in low ionic strength assay buffer. At 400 mmNaCl, the activity was 36 and 14% of control with pNPP and Tyr(P)-MBP, respectively.Inhibitors and Activators of Phosphatase ActivityThe effect of classic phosphatase inhibitors and other potential effectors on the activity of GST-Cdc14p was examined using three different substrates as shown in Table II. GST-Cdc14p was insensitive to tartrate and tetramisole, which inhibit certain broad specificity acid and alkaline phosphatases, respectively. The fusion protein was not sensitive to either NaF, which inhibits most Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, or 100 nm okadaic acid, an inhibitor of both type 1 and type 2A protein Ser/Thr phosphatases. In contrast, sodium vanadate and sodium tungstate, which are potent inhibitors of both protein tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases, effectively inhibited GST-Cdc14p (Table II). These findings in combination with the aforementioned effects of the Cys283 mutation support our identification of Cdc14p as a dual specificity phosphatase.Table IIEffect of various compounds on GST-CDC14p activityAdditionConcentrationpNPPTyr(P)-MBPSer/Thr(P)-MBP%Control100100100NaF20 mm9810278Okadaic acid100 nm1019999Tartrate5 mm9910384Tetramisole1 mm1009194Sodium vanadate200 μm54833Sodium tungstate200 μm610ZnCl21 mm9490101Spermidine2 mm948653EDTA2.5 mm97108106ATP1 mm94204186GTP1 mm90226199cAMP1 mm47220228Heparin20 μg/ml37229ND2-cValue was not determined.Polyglutamate100 μg/ml34370395dsDNA2-aDouble-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was linearized pYES vector (5.9 kb).100 μg/ml56387258ssDNA2-bM13 DNA (7.2 kb) was the source of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).50 μg/ml30367156Phosphatase assays were conducted at 30°C for 15 min using 20 mm pNPP, 5 μm Tyr(P)-MBP, or 5 μm Ser/Thr(P)-MBP as substrate.

Open table in a new tab Effect of Polyanions on Cdc14p ActivityAs shown in Table II, activity with Tyr(P)- or Ser/Thr(P)-MBP was stimulated by polyanions, whereas activity with Tyr(P)-casein or pNPP was inhibited. With phospho-MBP substrates, stimulation of activity by nucleotide triphosphates, heparin, polyglutamate, and DNA ranged from 1.6- to 4.0-fold (Table II). The stimulation was dependent on polyanion concentration, but the response was biphasic with a sharp decrease in activity above a concentration of about 50 μg/ml (data not shown). In contrast, activity with pNPP or Tyr(P)-casein was unaffected by nucleotides and inhibited from 44–70% by high molecular weight polyanions such as heparin, polyglutamate, or DNA. With these substrates, inhibition by polyanions was concentration-dependent and saturated at concentrations above about 10 μg/ml (data not shown). Polyanions reducedV max but had little effect onK m for pNPP. The response of rCdc14p and GST-Cdc14p to polyanions was similar, indicating that GST does not influence nor mediate the effects of polyanions on phosphatase activity.Polyanions appear to affect activity by binding directly to the enzyme, since rCdc14p was bound to heparin-agarose at ionic strengths as high as 0.4 m NaCl and was retained on either single- or double-stranded DNA-cellulose at up to 0.35 m NaCl (data not shown). Both Tyr(P)- and Ser/Thr(P)-MBP were bound by heparin-agarose under conditions used for assays (data not shown), indicating that the influence of polyanions may also be explained in part by their ability to interact with these basic substrates.The COOH-terminal Asn/Ser-rich Domain Is Not Required for the Activity of Cdc14pAs shown in Table I, truncated GST-Cdc14p-(1–374) in which residues 375–551 had been removed was active with all three substrates tested. When compared on a molar basis, the full-length and truncated enzymes had comparable activities toward the phosphoprotein substrates tested. In contrast, the truncated enzyme hydrolyzed pNPP at a rate that was about 10-fold lower than that of the full-length enzyme (Table I). Truncation of the fusion protein reduced the V max with pNPP but had little effect on K m. These data demonstrate that residues 375–551 from the Asn/Ser-rich COOH-terminal segment are not required for phosphatase activity in vitro and suggest that this noncatalytic domain has little influence on activity toward artificial protein substrates.Recombinant Cdc14p Is an OligomerTo estimate its size, thrombin-cleaved rCdc14p was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S300 column as shown in Fig.5 A. A major protein peak (A 280) containing rCdc14p as confirmed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown) coeluted with a peak of pNPPase activity (Fig. 5). SDS-PAGE also showed that the shoulder (fractions 88–94) on the major protein peak (Fig. 5 A) is due to the presence of lower molecular weight fragments derived from Cdc14p. Variable amounts of these fragments (about 5–20% of the total protein) were generated by internal cleavage during thrombin treatment of GST-Cdc14p but not GST-Cdc14p-(1–374). Calibration of the S300 column with molecular weight standards gave an apparent molecular weight of 248,000, suggesting that rCdc14p self-associates to form multimers, since its calculated molecular weight is 62,200. The oligomeric nature of rCdc14p was confirmed by determining its native molecular weight using two different methods. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis gave an estimated molecular weight of 131,000, while the value calculated from the sedimentation coefficient and Stokes radius was 169,000 (Table III). Although the values differ significantly, these independent measurements confirm the oligomeric state of rCdc14p.Figure 5Gel filtration chromatography of rCdc14p and rCdc14p-(1–374). Approximately 0.5 mg of rCdc14p and rCdc14p-(1–374) were separated on a Sephacryl S300HR column (1.5 × 97 cm) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and collected in 1.0-ml fractions.

The activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PtdIns(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; 4-phosphatase, inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase; Ins(3,4)P2, inositol 3,4-bisphosphate; Ins(1,3,4)P3, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. is a common feature of receptor-mediated signal transduction. PtdIns 3-kinase activation results in the rapid production of two potential second messengers, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3). Although the intracellular targets for these lipids remain poorly characterized, several isozymes of PKC have been shown to be activated by PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in vitro (1Nakanishi H.

In addition, the phosphorylation of pleckstrin, the major protein kinase C substrate in thrombin-stimulated human platelets, correlates temporally with levels of PtdIns(3,4)P2 (3Toker A. Bachelot C.

The growth factor-mediated activation of the serine/threonine protein kinase, PKB/Akt, has been shown to require PtdIns 3-kinase activation (4Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J.

The pleckstrin homology domain of PKB/Akt, a domain implicated in phosphoinositide binding, is required for PKB/Akt activation in vivo (5Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlin P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Recently, the addition of PtdIns(3,4)P2 to intact cells was shown to specifically activate PKB/Akt and to activate purified PKB/Akt in vitro(6Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). These data suggest a role for PtdIns(3,4)P2 in the regulation of protein kinases. Inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase (4-phosphatase) has recently been implicated in the metabolism of PtdIns(3,4)P2. The 4-phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the D-4 position phosphate of PtdIns(3,4)P2, inositol 3,4-bisphosphate (Ins(3,4)P2) and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4)P3) (7Bansal V.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, PtdIns(3,4)P2is preferentially hydrolyzed with a first order rate constant two orders of magnitude greater than that of the soluble substrates (8Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum raised against the C-terminal peptide of 4-phosphatase immunoprecipitates >95% of the PtdIns(3,4)P2 phosphatase activity from rat brain supernatant (9Norris F.A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16128-16133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The 4-phosphatase is inactivated in thrombin and calcium ionophore-stimulated human platelets by calpain-mediated proteolysis (10Norris F.A. Atkins R.C. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10987-10989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This inactivation of 4-phosphatase requires platelet aggregation and the presence of extracellular calcium ions, two factors that are required for the full accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 in thrombin-stimulated platelets (11Sorisky A.

In this study we report the cloning of a cDNA that encodes an isozyme of 4-phosphatase with 37% amino acid identity to the 4-phosphatase originally characterized. In addition, alternatively spliced cDNA of both isozymes of 4-phosphatase were identified that appear to encode C-terminal transmembrane domains. We have designated these 4-phosphatase isozymes as type I and type II with the hydrophilic and hydrophobic spliced forms as α and β, respectively. Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate was purchased from Calbiochem. [3H]Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, [α-32P]dATP, [γ-32P]ATP, and Colony/Plaque Screen hybridization filters were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Ins(3,4)P2, [3H]Ins(3,4)P2, and [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 were prepared as described previously (8Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All restriction enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. A 74-base pair PCR product was amplified from rat brain Quick-clone cDNA (CLONTECH) using degenerate oligonucleotides that were based on the amino acid sequence obtained from the type I 4-phosphatase CNBr peptide RVQPVLFNVGINEQQTLAERFGDTSLQ. This PCR product was used to screen a rat brain Uni-ZAP cDNA library (Stratagene) as described previously (9Norris F.A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16128-16133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). During the process of cloning rat type I 4-phosphatase cDNA, clones were isolated that encoded 4-phosphatase type II. Full-length rat 4-phosphatase II cDNA clones were isolated from the rat brain Uni-ZAP library (Stratagene) by hybridization screening using as probe a 413-base pair PCR product amplified from the 5′-end of a rat cDNA (clone 9) with the oligonucleotides 5-AGAACACGGCCAAGGCAAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTTTGTCAACTTTAGCGATA-3′ (antisense) using PCR conditions described previously (9Norris F.A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16128-16133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with the exception that 200 ng of each oligonucleotide was used. Human 4-phosphatase II EST clones, yy10a10, yx97 h10, yx36 g09, and zm11f05 were identified by a BLAST search (13Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) of the GenBank data base and were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Additional human cDNA clones were isolated from a human brain Lambda ZAP II cDNA library (Stratagene) by hybridization screening using a 362-base pair PCR product amplified from the EST clone yy10a10 using the oligonucleotides 5′-GCAGGTACACAGCCCTCACT-3′(sense) and 5′-AGAGCACTCCTGACAAGTTG-3′ (antisense) under the same PCR conditions used to generate the 413-base pair rat 4-phosphatase PCR product. The human type Iβ cDNA clone was isolated from the Lambda Zap II human fetal brain cDNA library (Stratagene) using the 480-base pair PCR product used in the original cloning of type Iα 4-phosphatase cDNA (9Norris F.A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16128-16133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All DNA probes were 32P-labeled using a random primed labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) using the manufacturer's protocol. The rat 4-phosphatase II clones were sequenced using the Sequenase kit version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) as described previously (9Norris F.A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16128-16133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The human 4-phosphatase II clones were sequenced using ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin Elmer) using the manufacturer's protocol with sequence reactions analyzed by the Nucleotide Sequencing Core Lab at Washington University School of Medicine. The human 4-phosphatase II PCR product was 32P-labeled using a random primed labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and used to probe a human multi-tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's protocol. The expression construct for 6-histidine-tagged rat 4-phosphatase II was prepared by ligating the 2898-base pair XhoI-KpnI fragment of a rat 4-phosphatase II clone into the PQE-31 bacterial expression vector (Qiagen) that was cut with KpnI andSalI. The expression construct for 6-histidine-tagged human 4-phosphatase I was prepared by ligating the 2928-base pairXhoI-EcoRI fragment of a human 4-phosphatase I clone into pTrcAHis bacterial expression vector (Invitrogen) that was cut with XhoI and EcoRI. Bacteria containing these expression vectors were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB broth until an A 600 of 0.6 optical density was reached. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added. After 5 h at room temperature, cells were harvested, and the protein was purified on Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as described previously (9Norris F.A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16128-16133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The protein was dialyzed and concentrated in a ProDiCon concentrator (Spectrum) containing 20 mm Hepes, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% octylglucoside (pH 7.5) and frozen at −140 °C prior to enzyme characterization. The amount of recombinant enzyme in these preparations was determined by Coomassie Blue staining of protein separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis compared with molecular weight standards. The recombinant enzyme in these preparations was only partially purified being 50–60% of the total protein. The enzymatic properties of the partially purified 4-phosphatase were readily characterized because control bacterial lysates contain no detectable phosphatase activity under the assay conditions. The 4-phosphatase soluble and lipid substrate assays were performed as described previously (9Norris F.A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16128-16133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Enzyme kinetic data were analyzed using Kcat 1.3 software (Biometallics, Inc.). The amino acid sequence homology was analyzed using DNASTAR Megalign software (DNASTAR, Inc.) During the original cloning of 4-phosphatase I cDNA, we initially obtained a 74-base pair PCR product using degenerate primers derived from the amino acid sequence of a CNBr peptide from a purified rat brain 4-phosphatase (9Norris F.A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16128-16133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The PCR product predicted the amino acids of the CNBr peptide suggesting that it was amplified from 4-phosphatase cDNA. However, analysis of several PCR products indicated the presence of two PCR products that differed at nucleotides in the wobble positions of four codons. This sequence variation suggested the existence of another cDNA encoding a protein related to the 4-phosphatase, and further cDNA library screening yielded clones that encode an enzyme that we have designated inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase II (4-phosphatase II). The 4-phosphatase II composite cDNA sequence consists of 3178 base pairs with an open reading frame predicting a protein with a molecular mass of 105,257 Da (Fig. 1). The open reading frame begins at a consensus start methionine (14Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 20: 8125-8148Crossref Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) with an upstream stop codon in the −29 position. The 3′-end of this cDNA terminates 54 base pairs after the stop codon without a poly(A) tail suggesting that additional 3′-untranslated region remains to be identified. The human 4-phosphatase II cDNA sequence was also determined from the composite sequence of four cDNA clones isolated from a human brain cDNA library and four human EST clones. The human 4-phosphatase II open reading frame predicts a protein with a molecular mass of 104,744 Da. As shown in Fig.2, the rat and human type II 4-phosphatases are highly conserved with 90% identical amino acid residues for the entire length of the proteins. Unlike 4-phosphatase I, the human and rat 4-phosphatase II enzymes do not possess PEST sequences; proline, aspartic acid/glutamic acid, serine/threonine rich motifs common in substrates of the calcium-dependent protease, calpain (15Rogers S. Wells R. Rehsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar).Figure 2Alignment of amino acid sequences of rat and human 4-phosphatase type II.

Double dots indicate a conservative substitution, and the single dots indicate a single nucleotide change.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The type I and type II rat 4-phosphatases are 37% identical at the amino acid level (Fig. 3). In some regions the similarity is much greater, for example the C-terminal antipeptide antibody against 4-phosphatase I described previously (9Norris F.A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16128-16133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) also precipitates type II enzyme (data not shown). The motif CKSAKDRT is conserved between the type I and type II 4-phosphatases and contains the active site consensus sequence Cys-Xaa5-Arg identified in several other Mg2+-independent phosphatases including protein tyrosine phosphatases, dual specificity protein phosphatases, and low molecular weight acid phosphatases (16Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15266-15270Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The conserved cysteine within the Cys-Xaa5-Arg motif functions as the nucleophile for catalysis, and cysteine modifying reagents are potent inhibitors of this class of phosphatases (17Zhou G. Denu J.M. Wu L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28084-28090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both type I and type II rat 4-phosphatases are completely inactivated by the cysteine modifying reagent N-ethylmaleimide, a result consistent with these enzymes being Cys-Xaa5-Arg phosphatases (data not shown). Additional studies using site-directed mutagenesis will evaluate the role of the CKSAKDRT motif in 4-phosphatase catalysis. The enzymatic properties of recombinant rat 4-phosphatase II are similar to those reported for human 4-phosphatase I. As shown in Fig.4 A, 4-phosphatase II catalyzes the hydrolysis of PtdIns(3,4)P2 to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate in a time- and enzyme concentration-dependent manner. The first order rate constant for PtdIns(3,4)P2hydrolysis using 0.6 ng of either recombinant rat 4-phosphatase II or human 4-phosphatase I was 0.45 × 10−2sec−1 and 1.1 × 10−2sec−1, respectively. The Lineweaver-Burk analysis of 4-phosphatase II hydrolysis of the soluble inositol phosphate substrates indicates a K m for Ins(3,4)P2and Ins(1,3,4)P3 of 39 and 34 μm, respectively and a V max for Ins(3,4)P2 and Ins(1,3,4)P3 of 26 and 22 μmol/min/mg enzyme, respectively (Fig. 4 B). TheseK m and V max values are similar to those measured for recombinant human 4-phosphatase type I hydrolysis of Ins(3,4)P2 (K m = 28 μm; V max = 32 μmol/min/mg) and Ins(1,3,4)P3 (K m = 46;V max = 28 μmol/min/mg). Other properties similar to those reported for 4-phosphatase I are that 4-phosphatase II activity is optimal between pH 7 and pH 8 and is strongly inhibited by inositol hexakisphosphate with an IC50 of 50 μm (data not shown) (7Bansal V.S. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 265: 1806-1811Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 8Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of the expression of human 4-phosphatase II is shown in Fig. 5. Four primary transcripts of 9.5, 5.3, 3.9, and 2.9 kilobases are detected. The 5.3-kilobase transcript is detected only in the brain. The relative abundance of the other transcripts is skeletal muscle > heart ≫ brain = placenta = pancreas > liver > kidney > lung. The pattern of 4-phosphatase II expression contrasts with that of 4-phosphatase I, which has the highest level of expression in the brain (9Norris F.A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16128-16133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) suggesting that type I and type II isozymes may have tissue-specific functions. Alternately spliced forms of human type I and rat type II 4-phosphatase cDNA clones were isolated that predict proteins of 107,309 Da and 106,497 Da, respectively. These splice variants encode hydrophobic C termini that contain putative membrane-spanning domains (Fig.6). The splice junctions for these alternatively spliced forms of types I and II 4-phosphatase occur 38 codons 3′ of the potential active site motif following the conserved amino acids CMR (Fig. 6). This alternative splicing of 4-phosphatase II mRNA may explain in part the presence of the multiple sized transcripts in the 4-phosphatase II Northern blot. The alternatively spliced forms of types I and II 4-phosphatase expressed in bacteria or SF9 insect cells possess no detectable 4-phosphatase activity for PtdIns(3,4)P2, Ins(3,4)P2, or Ins(1,3,4)P3 (data not shown). Additional factors and/or processing may be required for the activation of these splice variants. Expression in mammalian cells may be required to characterize their enzymatic properties. We designate the isozymes with the hydrophilic C termini as types Iα and IIα 4-phosphatases and those with hydrophobic C termini as types Iβ and IIβ 4-phosphatases. Human EST clone yy41 g12 represents a partial clone of human 4-phosphatase IIβ that is 100% identical to the rat 4-phosphatase IIβ over the 51 amino acids predicted from sequence obtained from a BLAST search (13Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) of the GenBankTM data base indicating that the type IIβ splice variant is present in humans (data not shown). The discovery of 4-phosphatase II and the β-forms of the 4-phosphatases demonstrates the diversity of this novel enzyme family. Isozyme diversity is a common feature of other enzymes involved in inositol phosphate-mediated signaling; two isozymes of the inositol polyphosphate 3-phosphatase (18Caldwell K.K. Lips D.L. Bansal V.S Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18378-18386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and six isozymes of inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (19Majerus P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) currently have been identified. The role of the 4-phosphatase isozymes in the regulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2-mediated signaling will be the focus of future studies. We thank Marina Ermolaeva for assistance in screening the human brain cDNA library and Dr. Evan Sadler for comments on this manuscript."

The mechanism for cell-specific binding of Sp1 to either of these promoters is unknown. Since Sp1 binding in other gene systems is affected either directly or indirectly by other transcription factors such as Egr-1 (19Ebert S.N. Wong D.L. J. Biol.

Sp1-related genes have recently been cloned based on their sequence homology to Sp1 (24Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 25Hagen G. Muller S. Beato G. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Both Sp2 and Sp3 are widely expressed; however, Sp4 expression is restricted to certain cells of the brain. Sp4 (26Hagen G. Dennig J. Preiß A. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol.

Further, Sp1-mediated activation of promoter constructs containing the E1B TATA box fused to either two Sp1 binding sites from element II in the uteroglobin promoter (27Dennig J. Hagen G. Beato M.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) were reversed when Sp3 was cotransfected, and it was proposed that Sp3 acts by competitively binding to the Sp1 binding site. The finding that Sp3 can act as a transcriptional repressor prompted us to examine whether cell-specific expression of CD11c andCD11b was a result of the repressor activity of Sp3 on these promoters in nonmyeloid cells. Surprisingly, Sp3 was found to activate rather than repress the promoters of both CD11c andCD11b. This study shows that intact Sp1 sites are necessary for activation of both promoters by Sp3 and that Sp3 apparently competes for binding with Sp1 for the same or overlapping sites. Further, antisense studies indicate that both endogenous Sp1 and Sp3 proteins are functionally active on these promoters in myeloid cells. Lastly, Sp3 can cooperate with c-Jun for activation of theCD11c promoter. HL60 (promyelocytic leukemia, ATCC CCL 240), U937 (histiocytic lymphoma, ATCC CRL 1593), and Molt4 cells (T cell lymphoblastic leukemia, ATCC CRL 1582) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Biofluids, Rockville, MD). HeLa cells (cervical epitheloid carcinoma, ATCC CCL 2) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Biofluids). Schneider's Drosophila 2 cells (Drosophila melanogaster embryo, ATCC CRL 1963) were grown in Schneider's medium containing 10% insect-tested fetal calf serum (Sigma). All media contained 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin. The −133 to +66 region of the CD11cpromoter was prepared by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; wt, wild type; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis; pPacO,Drosophila actin promoter expression plasmid; Rb, retinoblastoma protein. with oligonucleotide primers specific to this region and fused to the luciferase gene. The primers used in the PCR were initially synthesized with aHindIII restriction site for cloning of the final PCR product into the HindIII site immediately upstream of the luciferase gene in plasmid pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) to create a CD11c-luciferase reporter plasmid (referred to as wild type, wt). The −500 to +50 region of the CD11b promoter was prepared in a similar manner and ligated into the HindIII site immediately upstream of the luciferase gene in plasmid pGL3-Basic (Promega) to create a wt. Primers containing deletions of Sp1/Sp3 binding sites were used in the PCR to construct additionalCD11c-luciferase reporter plasmids and aCD11b-luciferase reporter plasmid containing specific deletions of these sites (refer to figure legends for details). The plasmid pPacSp1, which expresses Sp1 from the Drosophilaactin promoter, and the control plasmid pPacO containing only theDrosophila actin promoter was generously provided by Dr. R. Tjian. To construct plasmids that express Sp2 and Sp3 from the actin promoter (plasmids pPacSp2 and pPacSp3, respectively), cDNA clones for Sp2 and Sp3 (Ref. 24Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar; ATCC 95507 and ATCC 95505, respectively) were obtained from ATCC and used as templates in the PCR to generate DNAs containing the complete coding sequences for these factors. The primers contained XhoI restriction sites that were used to clone the Sp2 and Sp3 DNAs into the XhoI site of pPacO. The plasmid pCMV-Hrb (30Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D.R. Murata Y.

A. 1993; 90: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), which expresses the human retinoblastoma gene from the cytomegalovirus early promoter, was generously provided by Dr. J. M. Horowitz. To construct plasmid pPacJun, which expresses c-Jun from the Drosophila actin promoter, the plasmid pCMV c-Jun, kindly provided by Dr. R. Tjian, was used as a template in the PCR to generate DNA corresponding to the complete coding sequence for c-jun. XhoI sites were incorporated into the PCR primers to facilitate cloning of c-jun into the XhoI site of pPacO. To construct plasmid pPac-luciferase, which expresses luciferase from the Drosophila actin promoter, pGL3-Basic was used as a template in the PCR to generate DNA corresponding to the complete coding sequence for luciferase that was subsequently ligated into the pPacO plasmid. The integrity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequence analysis. Transfections of human cells were performed by electroporation as described previously (31Noti J.D. Gordon M. Hall R.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 107 cells were transfected with 15 μg of reporter plasmid and either 0.5 or 5 μg of each expression plasmid when used (see figure legends for specific details). The total volume of the plasmid transfection mix was adjusted to 30 μg with the control plasmid, pPacO. Electroporated cells were transferred to tissue culture dishes containing 15 ml of medium, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10 ng/ml final concentration) was added 24 h later. The cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was assayed using a kit supplied by Promega. HL60 cells treated with Sp3 antisense oligonucleotides received PMA immediately after electroporation for a total of 24 h. Luciferase light output was measured in a Beckman scintillation counter and normalized against the total protein concentration in the cellular extract. DNA was introduced into Drosophila cells by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection as described previously (17Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 × 106 Drosophila cells were transfected with 10 μg of a specific luciferase reporter plasmid and either 0.5 or 5 μg of each expression plasmid (see figure legends for specific details). The total volume of the plasmid transfection mix was adjusted to 30 μg with pPacO. The calcium phosphate-DNA precipitates were left on the cells for 48 h before harvesting and assaying for luciferase activity. Most transfections were performed in triplicate and repeated four to five times to ensure reproducibility and to monitor for transfection efficiency. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Roselle, IL). Data from individual experiments were pooled and expressed as the mean ± S.D. EMSA was performed as described previously (7Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts for use in the EMSA were prepared from all untransfected human cell lines as described previously (7Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared fromDrosophila cells transfected with pPacSp1, pPacSp2, or pPacSp3 as described by Andrews and Faller (32Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Forty-eight hours after transfection of 3 × 106 Drosophila cells, the cells were harvested and pelleted for 10 min at 248 × g in a bench-top centrifuge. The cells were resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to a 2-ml Eppendorf tube, and pelleted for 3 min at 735 × g. The cells were resuspended in 400 μl of cold Buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The cells were vortexed at top speed for 10 s and pelleted at top speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 s. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 100 μl of cold low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 150 μl of high salt buffer (low salt buffer but with 1.6 m KCl) were slowly added. The nuclei were gently mixed on a rocker shaker for 30 min at 4 °C to extract nuclear proteins then pelleted at top speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was stored at −80 °C. The following double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were used: 5′ GTACTCTGCCCGCCCCCT 3′, which corresponds to the −79 to −62 region of the CD11c promoter (this probe contains site D (shown in bold; see Fig. 1 and Ref. 17Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which shows homology to the Sp1 consensus binding sequence); 5′ CTCCGGTTGGGGGGTGGGGGCGTGTGGGAGGCCGAGC 3′, which corresponds to the −135 to −99 region of theCD11c promoter (this probe contains sites A, B, and C (shown in bold; see Fig. 1 and Ref. 17Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which show homology to the Sp1 consensus binding sequence); and 5′ TGTGCTCACTGAGCCTCCGCCCTCTTCCTTTGA 3′, which corresponds to the −80 to −48 region of the CD11b promoter (this probe contains an Sp1 binding site (shown in bold; Ref. 18Chen H.-M. Pahl H.L. Scheibe R.J. Zhang D.-E. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8230-8239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP to a specific activity of 2–4 × 108 cpm/μg. Approximately 2–4 × 104 cpm of each probe were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with either 10 μg of nuclear extract prepared from untransfected PMA-stimulated HL60 cells or 10 μg of nuclear extract prepared from Drosophila cells transfected with pPacSp1, pPacSp2, or pPacSp3 as described previously (7Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For supershift analysis, 1 μl of antibody specific for Sp1, Sp3, or Sp4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added for 1 h after incubation of the probe with protein. The reaction products were analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (7Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Transfected Drosophila cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% SDS) and boiled for 5 min, and the lysate from 3 × 105 cells was loaded onto each lane of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting was performed as described (33Williams C.L. Phelps S.H. Porter R.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with Sp1, Sp3, and c-Jun antibodies (Santa Cruz) at a final concentration of either 1 or 2 μg/ml for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The filter was washed then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulins diluted 1:4000, and bound antibody was visualized with an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Corp.). The following phosphorothioate-modified nucleotides (34Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared and HPLC-purified: 5′ AAGTAGCAGCACTTGGAATCTGGACT, an Sp3-specific antisense oligonucleotide that overlaps the Ile translational initiation codon of the Sp3 mRNA (24Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and 5′ ATTGCATCTATCGGCTTGATTTACCT 3′, a nonsense oligonucleotide. HL60 cells were incubated in complete medium with either nonsense or antisense oligonucleotide at a final concentration of 20 μm for 48 h (fresh oligonucleotides were added after 24 h), and Northern blotting was performed as described previously (15Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and analyzed on a Storm phosphoimager to determine the extent of down-regulation of mRNAs for Sp3, CD11c, andCD11b. Western blotting was performed to determine the effect of these oligonucleotides on expression of Sp3 and Sp1 protein. My laboratory has recently shown using in vitro DNase I footprinting that purified Sp1 can protect the −132 to −104 and −72 to −63 regions of the CD11c promoter (Fig.1 A) and that sites within both regions are essential for promoter activation (17Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). EMSA of these two regions of the CD11c promoter with nuclear extract protein from HL60 cells revealed multiple DNA·protein complexes (Ref. 17Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar and Fig. 2). Of the three complexes formed using a probe that spans the −72 to −63 region (CD11cprobe −79 to −62), complex 1 was supershifted with anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 3). Similarly, of the four complexes formed using a probe that spans the −132 to −104 region (CD11c probe −135 to −99), supershift analysis with anti-Sp1 antibody showed tht Sp1 was bound to complex 1 (Fig. 2, compare lanes 7 and 8). The same complex formations and supershifts with anti-Sp1 antibody were seen when nuclear extract protein from nonmyeloid cell lines, Molt4 and HeLa, were analyzed (data not shown). Since Sp1-related proteins have recently been isolated, analysis of these complexes with antibodies to Sp3 and Sp4 was performed to determine whether these factors were present in any of the other complexes. When anti-Sp3 antibody was included in an EMSA using CD11c probe −79 to −62, formation of complex 3 was inhibited (rather than supershifted) when HL60 nuclear extract protein was assayed (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2and 4). Similarly, formation of complex 4 was inhibited when the CD11c probe −135 to −99 was used (Fig. 2, comparelanes 7 and 9). The same complex formations and inhibition of specific complex formations by anti-Sp3 antibody were seen when Molt4 and HeLa nuclear extract protein were analyzed (data not shown). These results also indicate that Sp1 and Sp3 are not co-bound on the same DNA molecule, since anti-Sp3 antibody did not affect the formation of the Sp1-specific complexes and anti-Sp1 antibody did not supershift the Sp3-specific complexes. Previous results showed that an Sp1-specific oligonucleotide could effectively compete with the formation of all complexes, including the Sp3-specific ones (17Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that Sp3 competes with Sp1 for binding to the same or overlapping sites in theCD11c promoter. In contrast, anti-Sp4 antibody had no effect on any complex formation, indicating that Sp4 does not bind to these regions of the CD11c promoter (Fig. 2, lanes 5and 10). Chen et al. (18Chen H.-M. Pahl H.L. Scheibe R.J. Zhang D.-E. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8230-8239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show that the −66 to −59 region of theCD11b promoter was essential for Sp1-specific promoter activity (Fig. 1 B). EMSA using nuclear extract protein from HL60 cells and a DNA probe spanning this region (CD11b probe −80 to −48) revealed three DNA·protein complexes (Fig. 2). Similar to what was seen in the analysis of the CD11c promoter, anti-Sp1 antibody supershifted complex 1 (Fig. 2, compare lanes 12 and 13), and inclusion of anti-Sp3 antibody in the EMSA inhibited formation of complex 3 (Fig. 2, compare lanes 12 and 14), indicating the presence of bound Sp3 to this or an overlapping region of the CD11b promoter. Complex formations and reactions to anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies were similar when nuclear extract protein from Molt4 and HeLa cells were used (data not shown). Anti-Sp4 antibody had no effect on complex formation and, thus, Sp4 does not appear to interact within this region (Fig. 2, lane 15). To determine whether transfected Sp3 can bind to and activate the CD11c and CD11b promoters,Drosophila cells, which are deficient in Sp-related proteins (26Hagen G. Dennig J. Preiß A. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35Coury A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), were initially cotransfected with 5 μg of pPacSp3 along with either the wt CD11c promoter-luciferase plasmid (containing the −133 to +66 region of CD11c) or the wtCD11b promoter-luciferase plasmid (containing the −500 to +50 region of CD11b) (Fig. 3). For comparison, the role of transfected Sp1 and Sp2 from expression constructs pPacSp1 and pPacSp2, respectively, was similarly analyzed. EMSA revealed that Sp3 in these transfected Drosophila cells was expressed and could bind efficiently to CD11c probes −79 to −62 and −135 to −99 and CD11b probe −80 to −48 (Fig. 3, lanes 5, 12, and 19). Transfected Sp1 in these Drosophila cells could also bind these three probes (Fig. 3, lanes 3, 10, and 17). When pPacSp1 and pPacSp3 were transfected together, both Sp1 and Sp3 were expressed and could bind CD11c probes −79 to −62 and −135 to −99 (Fig.3, lanes 7 and 14) and CD11b probe −80 to −48 (data not shown). As expected, transfected Sp1 bound to the CD11b probe was supershifted with anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 3, compare lanes 17 and 18), and binding of transfected Sp3 to the CD11b probe was blocked with anti-Sp3 antibody (Fig. 3, compare lanes 19 and 20). In contrast, transfected Sp2 did not bind either the CD11cprobes (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 11) or theCD11b probe (data not shown). Sp3-dependent luciferase activity from the CD11cpromoter was shown to increase linearly with up to 1 μg of cotransfected pPacSp3 (Fig.4 A). As was previously shown (17Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), CD11c promoter activity was also stimulated by Sp1, and this activity was also increased linearly with up to 1 μg of cotransfected pPacSp1 (Fig. 4 A). Maximal CD11cpromoter activity was attainable with either 10 μg of pPacSp3 (23-fold induction) or 5 μg of pPacSp4 (27-fold induction). A similar response of the CD11b promoter to Sp3 and Sp1 was seen (Fig.4 B). CD11b promoter activity increased linearly with up to 1 μg of either pPacSp3 or pPacSp1, and maximal activity was reached with either 5 μg of pPacSp3 (28-fold induction) or 5 μg of pPacSp1 (35-fold induction). Since antibodies to Sp1 and Sp3 affected formation of different complexes in EMSA using either the CD11c or CD11bprobes (Fig. 2), this indicated that Sp1 and Sp3 are not co-bound to the same DNA molecule. Instead, this result indicated that Sp1 and Sp3 compete for the same or overlapping sites when interacting either on the CD11c or CD11b promoter. To confirm this,Drosophila cells were transfected with the appropriate reporter construct and either 1 or 5 μg each of pPacSp1 and pPacSp3. If Sp1 and Sp3 act at distinctly different sites on either promoter, then cotransfection of pPacSp1 and pPacSp3 should result in higher promoter activity than that obtained when either expression construct was transfected separately. Luciferase activity from either the wt CD11c-luciferase plasmid (Fig. 4 A) or the wt CD11b-luciferase plasmid (Fig. 4 B) was not increased above that seen in the presence of only pPacSp1. This indicates that Sp1 and Sp3 compete for the same sites, and as subsequent rounds of transcription initiate from these promoters, either Sp1 or Sp3 is bound at each site, depending on relative binding affinities. Sequence analysis of the −135 to −99 and −79 to −62 regions of theCD11c promoter previously revealed four putative Sp1 binding sites (referred to as sites A, B, C, and D; Fig. 1 A and Ref.17Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). My laboratory reported that deletion of either the −121 to −103 (containing sites B and C) or the −70 to −65 (containing site D) region led to loss of PMA-inducibility of the CD11c promoter in HL60 cells and that Sp1 interacted at these sites (17Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To confirm that Sp3 interacts at the same sites as Sp1 in these promoters,CD11c-luciferase plasmids containing deletions (Δ) of either the −121 to −103 (ΔBC) or −70 to −65 region (ΔD) or both (ΔBCD) were cotransfected into Drosophila cells along with pPacSp1 or pPacSp3 (Fig. 5 A). Consistent with previous results, deletions of either site resulted in significantly lowered Sp1-mediated CD11c promoter activity. In contrast, although deletion of either site led to significantly decreased Sp3-mediated promoter activity, deletion of the −70 to −65 region had a much greater effect on activation of the CD11cpromoter by Sp3. Compared with the induction of the wt CD11cpromoter by Sp3 and Sp1 (18.1- and 23.2-fold, respectively), the induction by Sp3 was disproportionately lower than that by Sp1 when the −70 to −65 region was deleted (2.1-fold versus 10.2-fold, respectively). Further, interaction of Sp3 at each site is noncooperative, with each site responsible for a portion of the intact promoter activity. Analysis of the CD11b promoter indicated t"
https://openalex.org/W2092468896,"Electrical stimulation of contractions (pacing) of primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes increases intracellular calcium and activates a hypertrophic growth program that includes expression of the cardiac-specific gene, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). To investigate the mechanism whereby pacing increases ANF, pacing was tested for its ability to regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase family members, ANF promoter activity, and thetrans-activation domain of the transcription factor, Sp1. Pacing and the calcium channel agonist BAYK 8644 activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Pacing stimulated ANF-promoter activity approximately 10-fold. Furthermore, transfection with an expression vector for c-Jun, a substrate for JNK, also activated the ANF promoter, and the combination of pacing and c-Jun was synergystic, consistent with roles for JNK and c-Jun in calcium-activated ANF expression. Proximal serum response factor and Sp1 binding sites were required for the effects of pacing or c-Jun on the ANF promoter. Pacing and c-Jun activated a GAL4-Sp1 fusion protein by 3- and 12-fold, respectively, whereas the two stimuli together activated GAL4-Sp1 synergistically, similar to their effect on the ANF promoter. Transfection with an expression vector for c-Fos inhibited the effects of c-Jun, suggesting that c-Jun acts independently of AP-1. These results demonstrate an interaction between c-Jun and Sp1 and are consistent with a novel mechanism of calcium-mediated transcriptional activation involving the collaborative actions of JNK, c-Jun, serum response factor, and Sp1. Electrical stimulation of contractions (pacing) of primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes increases intracellular calcium and activates a hypertrophic growth program that includes expression of the cardiac-specific gene, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). To investigate the mechanism whereby pacing increases ANF, pacing was tested for its ability to regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase family members, ANF promoter activity, and thetrans-activation domain of the transcription factor, Sp1. Pacing and the calcium channel agonist BAYK 8644 activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Pacing stimulated ANF-promoter activity approximately 10-fold. Furthermore, transfection with an expression vector for c-Jun, a substrate for JNK, also activated the ANF promoter, and the combination of pacing and c-Jun was synergystic, consistent with roles for JNK and c-Jun in calcium-activated ANF expression. Proximal serum response factor and Sp1 binding sites were required for the effects of pacing or c-Jun on the ANF promoter. Pacing and c-Jun activated a GAL4-Sp1 fusion protein by 3- and 12-fold, respectively, whereas the two stimuli together activated GAL4-Sp1 synergistically, similar to their effect on the ANF promoter. Transfection with an expression vector for c-Fos inhibited the effects of c-Jun, suggesting that c-Jun acts independently of AP-1. These results demonstrate an interaction between c-Jun and Sp1 and are consistent with a novel mechanism of calcium-mediated transcriptional activation involving the collaborative actions of JNK, c-Jun, serum response factor, and Sp1. Increased cytoplasmic calcium has been demonstrated to up-regulate gene transcription in a variety of excitable cell types (1Sheng M. Dougan S.T. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell.

Calcium influx has also been shown to activate the tyrosine kinase, PYK2 (12Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J.

An additional member of the MAPK family, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is also calcium-activated in some cell types (15Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 16Zohn I.E. Yu H. Li X. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell.

A. 1996; 93: 10803-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), which further implicates the potential participation of the proto-oncogene product c-Jun in pathways involving calcium-stimulated gene expression. Although c-Jun is usually thought to confer transcriptional enhancement through AP-1 elements (19Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 20Angel P. Karin M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3237) Google Scholar), c-Jun has also been demonstrated to augment transcription from constructs containing putative binding sites for SRF; the mechanism of this activation does not appear to require the binding of Jun to SRF or the binding of Jun to the serum response element (SRE) (21Paradis P. MacLellan W.R. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10827-10833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that calcium activation of JNK could lead to enhanced transcription of genes containing AP-1 or SRE regulatory elements. Cardiac myocytes exhibit transient increases in cytoplasmic calcium that serve as the driving force behind contraction (22Wier W.G. Lopez-Lopez J.R. Shacklock P.S. Balke C.W. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 188: 146-160PubMed Google Scholar, 23Barry W.H. Bridge J.H. Circulation. 1993; 87: 1806-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the role of calcium in mediating cardiac myocyte contraction is well characterized, the potential participation of calcium in regulating cardiac gene expression has received less attention. Interestingly, cultured neonatal ventricular myocytes exhibit hypertrophic cellular growth that is dependent upon the contractile activity of the cells; cell size is increased in spontaneously contracting cell cultures (24McDermott P. Daood M. Klein I. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: H763-H769PubMed Google Scholar,25McDermott P.J. Rothblum L.I. Smith S.D. Morgan H.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ivester C.T. Kent R.L. Tagawa H. Tsutsui H. Imamura T. Cooper G., IV McDermott P.J. Am. J.

Furthermore, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), a cardiac-specific gene that serves as a marker of the hypertrophic phenotype (29Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 30van Bilsen M. Chien K.R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), is strongly up-regulated by pacing of contractions (26McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although thecis-elements in the ANF gene responsible for induction in response to pacing have not been elucidated, promoter mapping studies have shown that a promoter-proximal SRE and an Sp1-like element in the ANF 5′-flanking sequence are important for ANF induction in response to other growth promoters, such as the α1-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine (31Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32Ardati A. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5131-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is possible that even though pacing and α1-adrenergic receptor activation represent quite different modes of stimuli, they may nonetheless converge on common signaling pathways to confer ANF induction. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the signaling mechanisms by which pacing leads to ANF promoter activation in cardiac myocytes. The findings support the view that induction by pacing involves the participation of members of the JNK, c-Jun, serum response factor, and Sp1 pathways, converging on an ANF promoter-proximal serum response element and an Sp1-like element. To our knowledge, this is the first report that relates increases in intracellular calcium with transcriptional induction via c-Jun and Sp1. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were dissociated as described previously (31Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33Shields P.P. Dixon J.E. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12619-12628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 1–4-day-old rat hearts were dissected, and the apical one-third of the ventricle was removed, minced, and subjected to repeated rounds of trypsinization. For transfection, the dissociated cells were resuspended in minimal medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and DNA, electroporated in a Bio-Rad (Hercules) gene pulser (600 or 700 V, 25 microfarad, 100 ohm, 0.2-cm gap cuvette), and plated onto fibronectin-coated wells in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. DNA concentrations used in the transfections were 10 μg/well for reporter genes based on the ANF 5′-flanking sequence (described below) or 5 μg/well for the GAL4-sensitive reporter, pG5E1bluc; 3 μg/well CMV-β-gal (CLONTECH), a cytomegalovirus-driven expression vector for bacterial β-galactosidase, was also routinely included. Phenylephrine (10 μm) and propranolol (1 μm) were also present in the plating medium of transfected myocytes that improved plating efficiency of the cells. After 18–20 h, the cells were extensively rinsed and refed with minimal medium (without serum, phenylephrine, or propranolol). Cells were then subjected to the electrical pacing of contractions (3 Hz) for 24–72 h utilizing the apparatus previously described (26McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34McDonough P.M. Stella S.L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9466-9472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the experimental treatments, the cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity (35Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar, 36MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Myocytes plated at a density of 2 million cells/35-mm well were switched to serum-free medium for 24 h before treatment. Agonists were prepared in serum-free medium and added for the times indicated. Treatments were stopped by washing in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were scraped in 500 μl of buffer C (10 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm Na3VO4, pH 7.4 (37Bogoyevitch M.A. Ketterman A.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29710-29717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Lysates were immunoprecipitated (for each sample, lysates from two wells were pooled) via either anti-ERK1 or anti-JNK-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz) and protein A-coupled Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in phosphate-buffered saline. The ERK-1 antibody-Sepharose pellets were washed once in buffer C and then washed two times in Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Pellets were incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm ATP, 6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) with 2 μg of myelin basic protein as a substrate for 20 min at 30 °C. JNK1 antibody-Sepharose pellets were washed twice in buffer C, washed twice in buffer D (50 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0), and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 20 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) with 1 μg of GST c-Jun (1–79) as a substrate (37Bogoyevitch M.A. Ketterman A.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29710-29717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). GST-c-Jun (1–79) was expressed inEscherichia coli through use of a pGEX-2T-c-Jun-(1–79) plasmid (supplied by Dr. Michael Karin, University of California, San Diego) and isolated by standard techniques. Kinase reactions were stopped by boiling in 4 × Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min, the Sepharose were pelleted by centrifuging at 14,000 rpm, and the supernatants were run out on either 12% (ERK) or 15% (JNK) polyacrylamide gels. Incorporation of 32P into the bands corresponding to myelin basic protein or c-Jun (1–79) was quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. For sequential immunoprecipitations, the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-JNK1 antibody followed by the anti-ERK1 antibody after which the samples were subjected to the individual in vitro kinase reactions exactly as described above. Preparation of the truncation mutants of chimeric rat ANF promoter/luciferase reporter constructs ANF-3003GL, ANF-638GL, ANF-122GL, ANF-109GL, and ANF-65GL has been previously reported (31Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). ANF-638/C114GL and ANF-638/C69GL were prepared with either pGL2 or pGL3 (Promega) as the reporter plasmids, using previously published procedures (31Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The ANF-65/3X SREGL construct was prepared beginning with the following oligonucleotide pair, which spans the ANF 5′-flanking sequence from positions −134 to −99: (+) 5′-ccgggCTTCGCTGGACTGATAACTTTAAAAGGGCATCTTCTg-3′ and (−) 5′-ctagcAGAAGATGCCCTTTTAAAGTTATCAGTCCAGCGAAGc-3′. The uppercase nucleotides are native ANF sequences, and the lowercase nucleotides were added to provide PspAi and NheI ends for cloning purposes. Following phosphorylation and hybridization, the ANF −134/−99 oligonucleotide pairs were ligated to form a 3X concatomer, cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla CA), and then subcloned into the multiple cloning site in ANF-65GL to create ANF-65/3X SREGL. This construct possesses three copies of ANF −134/−99 in alternating orientations driving the minimal ANF promoter, i.e. ANF-65GL. The structures of all plasmid constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing. The plasmids pG5E1bluc (GAL4-sensitive luciferase reporter construct) and GAL4 -Sp1 were obtained from Drs. Roger J. Davis and Michael R. Green (University of Massachusetts) and Dr. John Y.-J. Shyy (University of California, San Diego). GAL4-DBD, which contains only the DNA binding domain of GAL4, was obtained from Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego). The Rous sarcoma virus promoter-driven expression plasmids pRSV-c-jun and pSV-fos were obtained from Dr. Kathleen McGuire (San Diego State University) and Dr. Michael Karin. Agents that stimulate hypertrophic growth and ANF expression in cultured neonatal ventricular myocytes often also activate ERK (38Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,39Bogoyevitch M.A. Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), a MAPK family member implicated in transcriptional up-regulation through SRF-dependent pathways (40Rivera V.M. Miranti C.K. Misra R.P. Ginty D.D. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6260-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 41Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). To determine if the electrical pacing of contraction activates ERK, myocytes were paced, the endogenous ERK was immunoprecipitated, and in vitro kinase reactions were performed utilizing myelin basic protein as a substrate. Pacing did not appear to activate ERK at any time ranging from 5 to 60 min (Fig.1 A), whereas the phorbol ester phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) strongly activated ERK activity, serving as a positive control. In contrast, pacing was found to activate the related MAPK family member JNK (Fig. 1 B). Maximum JNK activation was observed within 60 min of the initiation of pacing (Fig. 1 C), and the overall time course was similar to the activation of JNK displayed by endothelin-stimulated cardiac myocytes (37Bogoyevitch M.A. Ketterman A.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29710-29717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Over a total of six experiments, pacing at 3 Hz for 60 min activated JNK an average of 2.3 ± 0.6-fold (mean ± S.E.). The selective activation of JNK by treatments that raise intracellular calcium was also demonstrated through use of a sequential immunoprecipitation procedure, with JNK and ERK immunoprecipitated from the same cell lysates. Like pacing, BAYK 8644 or KCl + BAYK 8644 increase calcium influx and intracellular calcium concentration in cardiac myocytes (34McDonough P.M. Stella S.L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9466-9472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and these treatments activated JNK with no effect on ERK (Fig. 2). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that intracellular calcium may serve as a positive regulator of JNK activity in cardiac myocytes.Figure 2Effects of BAYK 8644 and KCl on ERK and JNK activity. Myocardial cells were exposed to Bay K 8644 (10 μm), Bay K 8644 (10 μm) + KCl (100 mm), anisomycin (50 ng/ml), or PDBu (100 nm) for 60 min, lysed, and subjected to a sequential immunoprecipitation procedure for JNK1 and ERK1. The immunocomplexes were then tested for kinase activity in separate assays using either GST-c-Jun (1–79) (for JNK) or myelin basic protein (for ERK) as substrates (see “Experimental Procedures”). Samples were assayed in duplicate.Con, control; MBP, myelin basic protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because pacing is a known activator of ANF transcription (26McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ANF promoter mapping studies were undertaken to assess how pace-induced JNK activation could lead to increased ANF expression. Cultured neonatal ventricular myocytes were transfected with a construct containing 3003 base pairs of the rat ANF 5′-flanking sequence (FS) ligated to the firefly luciferase (ANF-3003GL). Pacing at 3 Hz elicited an approximately linear increase in luciferase expression over a 72-h time course (Fig. 3 A), which is consistent with the previously reported effects of pacing on ANF peptide and mRNA levels (26McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify regions within the 5′-FS of ANF that confer pace inducibility, myocytes were transfected with a series of ANF promoter truncations, paced for 48 h, and tested for the production of luciferase activity. ANF-122GL, which contains just 122 base pairs of the ANF 5′-FS, was induced by pacing to the same degree as ANF-3003GL; truncations utilizing less of the ANF 5′-FS, however, were less sensitive to pacing, suggesting that responsiveness to pacing is conferred by sequences within the first 122 base pairs of the ANF promoter (Fig. 3 B). Previous studies have shown that a promoter-proximal SRE and an Sp1-like site, located at −114 and −70, respectively, in the ANF 5′-FS, are critical for ANF induction by α1-adrenergic agonists (31Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32Ardati A. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5131-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To evaluate the roles of SRE/−114 and Sp1/−70 on promoter activity in the context of 638 base pairs of the ANF 5′-FS, reporter constructs possessing clustered point mutations (described in Fig.4 A) were tested. Pace inducibility was considerably decreased when either ANF-638/C114GL or ANF-638/C69GL was used as the test construct (Fig. 4 B). Loss of the SRE-like or the Sp1-like sequence resulted in an approximate 5- or 20-fold drop in reporter expression, respectively. Interestingly, reporter production from ANF-65/3X SREGL, a construct comprised of a concatamer of three SRE/−114s ligated to an ANF minimal promoter (ANF-65Luc), was highly inducibile by pacing (Fig. 4 B). This induction was inhibited by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (data not shown), a compound that blocks both electrically stimulated calcium transients and pacing induction of ANF mRNA (26McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that SRE/−114 may confer pace inducibility to a minimal ANF promoter, confirming a linkage between increased intracellular calcium and SRF-enhanced transcription. Because inducibility of the ANF promoter by pacing appeared to involve an SRE and an Sp1 element and because pacing activated JNK, studies were undertaken to establish a connection between the JNK-c-Jun pathway and SRE/−114 and Sp1/−70. A well characterized function of JNK is the phosphorylation of c-Jun in a manner that leads to the activation of Jun as a transcription factor (19Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Consistent with the involvement of the JNK-c-Jun pathway in pace-induced ANF expression, overexpression of c-Jun activated gene expression from ANF-638GL (Fig. 4 C) in a manner similar to pacing. 2Transfection with 5 μg/well pRSV-c-jun consistently activated β-galactosidase expression from CMV-β-gal an average of 2-fold, an effect that has previously been noted by others (21Paradis P. MacLellan W.R. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10827-10833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, results for experiments utilizing c-Jun or the combination of pacing plus c-Jun as stimuli were not normalized to β-galactosidase expression. Separate experiments in our laboratory have established that transfection efficiencies do not routinely vary by more than 20%. This result was consistent with findings using the 5′-flanking sequence of the human ANF gene in rat cardiac myocytes (42Kovacic-Milivojevic B. Gardner D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, inducibility by c-Jun was greatly decreased when cells were transfected with ANF-638/C114GL or ANF-638/C69GL (Fig. 4 C), which is consistent with a collaborative arrangement between c-Jun and these two elements in the ANF gene. Also, c-Jun overexpression strongly activated reporter production from ANF-65/3X SREGL (Fig. 4 C), further implicating a functional interaction between SRF and c-Jun. Because c-Jun cotransfection enhanced ANF promoter activity, it is possible that increasing JNK via pacing of contractions might have a further, perhaps synergistic effect with c-Jun, as the ectopically expressed c-Jun would be a potential substrate for JNK. Consistent with this idea, the combination of pacing and c-Jun resulted in a 76-fold induction of ANF promoter activity, compared with about 16- and 26-fold induction by pacing or c-Jun alone, respectively (Fig. 4 D). This result not only emphasizes the potential importance of the JNK-c-Jun pathway in regulating ANF expression but also suggests the possibility that pace activation of JNK might amplify ANF expression via other pathways that increase c-Jun expression in cardiac myocytes. Because the mutation analyses suggested that Sp1 or a closely related protein might participate in pacing- and c-Jun-inducibility of ANF, it was of interest to evaluate whether either of these treatments could augment Sp1-enhanced transcription. Accordingly, an Sp1-basedtrans-activation assay was employed that utilized a plasmid (pG5E1bluc) encoding luciferase ligated to a 5× concatamer of a GAL4-binding cis-element and plasmids encoding either the DNA binding domain of GAL4 alone (GAL4-DBD) or a plasmid (GAL4-Sp1) encoding a chimeric protein comprised of the “A”trans-activation domain of Sp1 ligated to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (43Southgate C.D. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2496-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). c-Jun had no effect on luciferase expression from pG5E1bluc plus GAL4-DBD (Fig.5 A); this is consistent with the fact that there are no AP1 elements in the GAL4 binding sites (44Giniger E. Varnum S.M. Ptashne M. Cell. 1985; 40: 767-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) or backbone sequences of pG5E1bluc and the lack of a functionaltrans-activation domain in GAL4-DBD. Cotransfection of GAL4-Sp1 with pG5E1bluc resulted in increased luciferase expression, suggesting that the trans-activation domain of Sp1 may be slightly activated by endogenous factors in the control cardiac myocytes. Cotransfection with c-Jun, however, led to a further marked increase in luciferase expression over the level obtained with just the pG5E1bluc and GAL4-Sp1 constructs (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that there may be functional interaction between c-Jun andtrans-activation domain A of Sp1. For six separate experiments, including the experiments illustrated in Fig. 5, 5 μg/well c-Jun increased luciferase expression from myocytes cotransfected with the pG5E1bluc and GAL4-Sp1 constructs by an average of 12-fold (a range of 6–30-fold). The GAL4-Sp1 system was also used to assess whether the supra-additive effects of pacing and c-Jun on ANF reporter activity could potentially be mediated by Sp1. In the experiment shown (Fig. 5 B), pacing alone stimulated Sp1-enhanced transcription by about 2.6-fold, and c-Jun overexpression led to an approximate 6-fold enhancement; the combined treatment of c-Jun plus pacing resulted in an approximate 30-fold increase in Sp1-enhanced transcription, a synergistic profile similar to the effect of these treatments on gene expression from ANF638-luc (see above). Unlike c-Jun, c-Fos did not increase Sp1-enhanced transcription when tested at either a relatively low concentration (0.1 μg/well in the transfection mixture) or at an input concentration identical to that used in the above experiments for c-Jun (5 μg/well) (Fig. 5 C). To directly compare the effects of c-Jun on the ANF promoter and Sp1, the dose-response relationships for c-Jun on luciferase expression from these reporter systems were determined ut"
https://openalex.org/W2018485485,"We investigated type 3 isoform (RyR3) of ryanodine receptor in rabbit skeletal muscles using an antibody specific for RyR3. By Western blot analysis and by immunoprecipitation, a single polypeptide for RyR3 was detected in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from rabbit diaphragm but not in those from back muscle. The molecular mass was slightly smaller than that of RyR1, the major isoform in skeletal muscles. Each of RyR1 and RyR3 formed a homotetramer in rabbit diaphragm. RyR3 had a single class of [3H]ryanodine binding sites of high affinity (K D = 1.6 nm). From theB max of the binding, the content of RyR3 was estimated to be only 0.6% of RyR1 in rabbit diaphragm. [3H]Ryanodine binding to RyR3 was biphasically dependent on Ca2+, as is true of RyR1, and was stimulated further by adenine nucleotide, caffeine, or high salt concentration. Procaine and ruthenium red inhibited the binding. RyR3 was more resistant to Mg2+ inhibition than RyR1. Interestingly, RyR3 showed about a 7-fold lower Ca2+ sensitivity for activation than RyR1. Comparison with the counterparts in bullfrog skeletal muscles indicates that the Ca2+ sensitivities of RyR3 homologs are similar to each other, whereas those of RyR1 homologs are species-specific.

Molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding mammalian RyRs has shown that there are three distinct isoforms of RyR (RyR1–3) encoded by different genes (6Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although recent studies by RNase protection analysis and by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that mRNA for all RyR isoforms could be widely detected in various tissues (12Furuichi T. Furutama D. Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4794-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ledbetter M.W. Preiner J.K. Louis C.F. Mickelson J.R. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), these isoforms are highly tissue-specific: RyR1 is expressed primarily in skeletal muscles and cerebellar Purkinje cells, RyR2 in cardiac muscles and ubiquitous regions of brain, and RyR3 in specific regions of brain and various peripheral tissues. Whereas RyR1 and RyR2 were obtained as purified proteins and their functional properties have been extensively examined (1Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 3Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), molecular characterization of RyR3 remains to be elucidated because of its more miniscule amount. Several studies have been done on the function of RyR3 in tissues where mRNA for RyR3 is expressed exclusively (15Giannini G. Clementi E. Ceci R. Marziali G. Sorrentino V. Science. 1992; 257: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 16Hakamata Y. Nishimura S. Nakai J. Nakashima Y. Kita T. Imoto K.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2999-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), but there have been few investigations on RyR3 protein and its functions. We purified α- and β-RyR from bullfrog skeletal muscles where the two isoforms coexist in almost equal amounts (18Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and found them to be homologs of RyR1 and RyR3, respectively, from similarities in the amino acid sequences deduced from their cDNAs (19Oyamada H.

Taking advantage of this, we recently produced an antibody (anti-RyR3) that reacts specifically with RyR3 among the three RyR isoforms, and we revealed by immunoprecipitation with anti-RyR3 that a homotetramer of RyR3 protein is expressed in some specific regions of mammalian brain as a caffeine-sensitive Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) channel (20Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Analysis of its mRNA showed that there were several tissue-specific alternative splicing variants of RyR3, especially between brain and peripheral tissues (11Marziali G. Rossi D. Giannini G. Charlesworth A. Sorrentino V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Miyatake R. Furukawa A. Matsushita M. Iwahashi K. Nakamura K. Ichikawa Y. Suwaki H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These alternatively spliced variants might generate potential heterogeneity in the function of RyR3 among tissues. mRNA for RyR3 was also found in mammalian skeletal muscles that express primarily RyR1 (14Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 15Giannini G. Clementi E. Ceci R. Marziali G. Sorrentino V.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2999-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Conti et al. (22Conti A. Gorza L. Sorrentino V. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated minor amounts of RyR3 protein in mammalian skeletal muscles by Western blot analysis. Interestingly, the content of RyR3 varied among different muscles in rat: higher levels in diaphragm and soleus, lower levels in abdominal muscles and tibialis anterior, and no detectable amounts in the extensor digitorum longus. A particularly high content of RyR3 in the diaphragm was observed in several mammals examined (rat, mouse, rabbit, and cow). To learn whether there are functional differences in RyR3 between brain and skeletal muscles, we identified and characterized here RyR3 expressed in rabbit skeletal muscles using the anti-RyR3 antibody (20Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The results of this study show that a homotetramer of RyR3 is expressed in rabbit diaphragm but is undetectable in back muscle. It may function as a CICR channel that is similar to RyR3 in rabbit brain. Further unique properties of RyR3 are also revealed. The peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence 4375–4387 of the rabbit RyR3 (RyR3-peptide) was synthesized at the Central Laboratory of Medical Sciences, Division of Biochemical Analysis, Juntendo University School of Medicine (20Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). [3H]Ryanodine (60–90 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-agarose was from Sigma. Egg lecithin (egg total phosphatide extract) was from Avanti Polar Lipids. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Heavy fraction of SR vesicles was prepared from rabbit diaphragm or back muscle according to Murayama and Ogawa (18Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml chymostatin). The isolated membranes were quickly frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C until use. SR vesicles (2–4 mg/ml at the final concentration) were incubated for 15 min on ice with 2% CHAPS and 1% egg lecithin in a buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The supernatant after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min was collected and used for detection and characterization of RyR3. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation with 5–20% linear gradients was performed as described (18Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with 2–12% linear gradient gels (18Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The molecular mass (in kDa) of standards used here was 205 (myosin heavy chain), 116 (β-galactosidase), 97.4 (phosphorylaseb), 66 (bovine serum albumin), 45 (ovalbumin), and 29 (carbonic anhydrase). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For Western blotting, the separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 40 V overnight in the presence of 0.02% SDS to facilitate the transfer of high molecular weight proteins (18Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Anti-RyR3 antibody was produced in rabbits against the synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence 4375–4387 of rabbit RyR3, and was purified with protein-bound polyvinylidene difluoride membranes of β-RyR from bullfrog skeletal muscle as described in Murayama and Ogawa (20Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The antibody reacted with RyR3 of mammalian brain and β-RyR of frog or chicken skeletal muscle, but no cross-reactivity was observed with mammalian RyR1, RyR2, or α-RyR of non-mammalian vertebrate skeletal muscles (20Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Western blotting was carried out colorimetrically as described previously (18Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as the substrate. Immunoprecipitation of RyR3 was performed using the purified anti-RyR3 antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG-agarose beads (20Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Solubilized SR vesicles (1–2 mg of protein) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of anti-RyR3 antibody and 30 μl of anti-rabbit IgG-agarose beads. For detection of the polypeptide band for RyR3, the beads were washed five times with a buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% CHAPS, and 2 mmdithiothreitol and were resuspended in 40 μl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) containing 0.1 m dithiothreitol. Aliquots of 15–20 μl were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Assays were carried out as described previously (20Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). SR vesicles (0.2 mg) were incubated with [3H]ryanodine (2–21 nm) for 4 h at 25 °C in 0.5 ml of a binding buffer containing 0.3 or 1m NaCl, 10 mm MOPSO/NaOH, pH 6.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% CHAPS, 0.5% egg lecithin, the mixture of protease inhibitors, and a specified concentration of free Ca2+ buffered with 10 mm EGTA. Then RyR3 was immunoprecipitated with 100 μl of anti-RyR3 and 30 μl of anti-rabbit IgG-agarose beads. The radioactivity of the beads after five washings with a buffer (1 m NaCl, 10 mmMOPSO/NaOH, pH 6.8, 1% CHAPS, 0.5% egg lecithin, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm Ca2+) was determined as the activity for RyR3. The nonspecific radioactivity was determined in the absence of anti-RyR3 in each experiment. The value was similar to that determined with the addition of 30 μmRyR3-peptide (see Fig. 5). The nonspecific activity was decreased as the salt concentration of the medium was increased and approached a value similar to the result on the addition of excess unlabeled ryanodine (10–50 μm) at 0.3 m NaCl. These findings indicate that it may be caused probably by direct binding of [3H]ryanodine and RyR1 to the agarose beads (see Fig. 2) rather than weak binding to anti-RyR3. By compensating for the nonspecific radioactivity thus determined, [3H]ryanodine binding specific to RyR3 can be obtained. In this study, the [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR3 could not be determined accurately in an isotonic medium containing 0.17 m NaCl because of a high nonspecific radioactivity. Instead, assays were carried out in a medium containing 0.3 m NaCl where the properties are assumed to be more physiological than those in 1m NaCl (see Figs. 8 and 9, Tables I and II). The binding for RyR1 was measured by filtering an aliquot of the remaining supernatants after immunoprecipitation through polyethyleneimine-treated Whatman GF/B glass filters (18Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Free Ca2+ was calculated using values of 8.79 × 105m−1 and 1.82 × 103m−1 as the apparent binding constants for Ca2+ of EGTA (24Harafuji H. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. 1980; 87: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and of AMP-PCP (25Ogawa Y. Kurebayashi N. Harafuji H. J.

The immunoprecipitated products were resolved on a 2–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.

The data were the mean ± S.E. of four determinations. To identify RyR3 in skeletal muscles, we prepared terminal cisternae-rich fractions of SR vesicles from rabbit skeletal muscles where RyR3 is reported to be localized (22Conti A. Gorza L. Sorrentino V. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because the content of RyR3 varied among different muscles in rat (22Conti A. Gorza L. Sorrentino V. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we used diaphragm (which was reported to express the highest content of RyR3 among skeletal muscles examined) and back muscle (material commonly used for SR vesicles) as materials. Fig.1 A shows a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of SR vesicles from diaphragm and back muscle. The two specimens showed very similar patterns of protein composition. Mammalian skeletal muscles express primarily RyR1, in contrast to skeletal muscles of non-mammalian vertebrates which have nearly equal amounts of two RyR isoforms (α- and β-RyR). Consistently, single bands for RyR1 of nearly equal density were clearly detected at the low mobility range of the gel (arrowhead) in both SR preparations, and the band for RyR3 could not be identified in diaphragm or back muscle SR on the Coomassie-stained gel. When the transferred membrane was probed with anti-RyR3, the antibody raised against a synthetic peptide (RyR3-peptide) corresponding to 4375–4387 of rabbit RyR3 which reacts highly specifically with mammalian RyR3 among the three isoforms (20Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a single band for RyR3 was faintly but significantly reacted just below the RyR1 band in diaphragm SR, but not in back muscle SR (Fig. 1 B). Thus, a minute amount of RyR3 in addition to dominant RyR1 was expressed in rabbit diaphragm, whereas no RyR3 was detected in back muscle SR. The expression of RyR3 was also examined by immunoprecipitation using antibody-conjugated agarose beads (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2 shows Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels of the proteins immunoprecipitated with the anti-RyR3 from CHAPS/egg lecithin-solubilized SR. In diaphragm SR, a single high molecular weight band (arrowhead) was observed, which specifically disappeared by the addition of 30 μmRyR3-peptide during immunoprecipitation (panel A). This band was reacted with anti-RyR3 on Western blot analysis (data not shown). These results indicate that RyR3 is definitely expressed in rabbit diaphragm. A band seen above RyR3 band was a minute contamination of RyR1 because of its positive reaction with anti-RyR1 antibody (data not shown). Because the band did not disappear by the RyR3-peptide, the precipitation of RyR1 may be the result of nonspecific binding to the agarose beads rather than weak binding to anti-RyR3. No specific bands, in contrast, were immunoprecipitated from back muscle SR (panel B), suggesting that there are no detectable amounts of RyR3 in back muscle, the same conclusion as shown in Fig. 1 B. The varied contents of RyR3 in contrast to similar amounts of RyR1 between diaphragm and back muscle corresponded well to the results with rat skeletal muscles (22Conti A. Gorza L. Sorrentino V. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The following experiments to characterize RyR3 in skeletal muscles were therefore carried out with diaphragm SR vesicles. The molecular mass of rabbit RyR3 protein is estimated to be 552 kDa from its predicted amino acid sequence (10Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), which is slightly smaller than that of rabbit RyR1 (565 kDa) (6Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K.

As shown in Fig.3, the mobility of immunoprecipitated RyR3 was slightly but significantly larger than that of RyR1 on the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The mobilities of RyR1 and RyR3 were similar to those of bullfrog α- and β-RyR, the homologs of RyR1 and RyR3, respectively, in non-mammalian vertebrates (18Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Oyamada H. Murayama T. Takagi T. Iino M. Iwabe N. Miyata T. Ogawa Y. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17206-17214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of tetramer is one of the typical characteristics of RyRs. As described above, rabbit diaphragm expresses considerable amounts of RyR1 and minor levels of RyR3 (see Fig. 1). It is therefore important to determine whether RyR3 forms a homotetramer of its subunit or heterotetramer with RyR1. The tetramer formation of RyR is detected easily by the sedimentation pattern of sucrose density gradients: a tetrameric RyR sediments to higher density fractions of the gradient because of its large sedimentation coefficient of about 30 S, whereas monomeric RyR subunits remain in lower density fractions as is true with the other proteins (26Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.-Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Lai F.A. Misra M. Xu L. Smith H.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.4 A shows the low mobility range of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels of total proteins (30 μl of each fraction) of fractions that were divided after centrifugation through 5–20% sucrose density gradient of solubilized rabbit diaphragm SR. The band for RyR1 was detected in higher density fractions (fractions 6 and 7) of the gradient. This pattern corresponds well with our previous results with α- and β-RyR of bullfrog skeletal muscle (18Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and RyR2 and RyR3 of rabbit brain microsomes (20Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) under identical conditions, as is true of RyR of rabbit skeletal muscle SR (26Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.-Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Lai F.A. Misra M. Xu L. Smith H.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sedimentation pattern of RyR3 through the sucrose gradient was similarly examined on the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel after immunoprecipitation of a large volume of the gradient fractions (4 ml of each fraction) with anti-RyR3. As shown in Fig.4 B, the bands for RyR3 were detected in the identical fractions of nos. 6 and 7. It should be noted that only a single RyR3 band was detected in the immunoprecipitated products on each lane of the gel. If RyR3 forms a heterotetramer with RyR1, the two should be coprecipitated, resulting in the detection of dual bands on the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel because of their different mobilities (see Fig. 3). The absence of an RyR1 band clearly excludes the possibility of heterotetramer formation of RyR3 with RyR1. These results indicate that each of RyR1 and RyR3 coexpressed in rabbit diaphragm exclusively forms a homotetramer. Homotetramer formation of RyR3 is also observed in rabbit brain, which expresses a high content of RyR2 (20Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The functional properties of RyR3 in rabbit skeletal muscles were determined through the [3H]ryanodine binding. Solubilized SR was incubated with [3H]ryanodine to achieve ryanodine binding, and then RyR3 was specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-RyR3 as described in Murayama and Ogawa (20Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the radioactivity immunoprecipitated with anti-RyR3 from SR of rabbit diaphragm or back muscle. In diaphragm SR, significant radioactivity was precipitated with the antibody. Thirty μmRyR3-peptide, which completely prevented RyR3 from being immunoprecipitated (see Fig. 2), reduced the radioactivity to the background level. A similar reduction in the radioactivity was also observed in determination without anti-RyR3 (data not shown). Therefore, the radioactivity is caused by RyR3 itself, but not by minute amounts of contaminating RyR1. The addition of excess concentrations (10–50 μm) of unlabeled ryanodine caused almost total loss of the radioactivity (data not shown). These results suggest that RyR3"

Previous studies have shown that calmodulin can inhibit the DNA binding activity of certain E proteins but not their heterodimers with class B proteins. Here we show that calmodulin binds to the DNA-interacting basic sequence within the bHLH domain of E proteins. The strength of the binding of bHLH proteins to calmodulin correlates directly with the calmodulin sensitivity of their DNA binding. The basic sequence of MyoD, a class B protein, can also interact with calmodulin. This interaction, however, is blocked by MyoD sequences directly N-terminal of the basic sequence. We further demonstrate that S-100 proteins can interact with and differentially inhibit the DNA binding of bHLH proteins through interaction with the basic sequence. Both the binding to the basic sequence and the effect of the directly N-terminal sequence vary for different S-100 proteins and bHLH proteins.

Class A bHLH transcription factors, also called E proteins, are broadly expressed and include the E2A gene products E12/E47 (2Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D.

Science. 1995; 268: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Functional activity of a class B protein in vivo requires heterodimerization with an E protein, resulting in the commitment of cells to differentiation pathways (14Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E.

Calcium plays a crucial role in many cellular processes (15Rasmussen H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 16Rasmussen H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Its actions are largely mediated through a family of calcium-binding proteins, of which calmodulin is the major calcium sensor. Calmodulin is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed protein that is essential for cell growth (17Takeda T. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3580-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 18Davis T.N. Urdea M.S. Masiarz F.R. Thorner J. Cell. 1986; 47: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Calmodulin has four high affinity calcium binding sites called EF-hands, each composed of two α-helices connected by a calcium binding loop (19Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Upon calcium binding, calmodulin undergoes a conformational change to expose hydrophobic patches (Ref. 20Tan R.-Y. Mabuchi Y. Grabarek Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7479-7483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and references therein), which allows interaction with numerous target proteins and the subsequent activation of signaling pathways. S-100 proteins are other members of the EF-hand protein family that also modulate the activities of various proteins. At least 17 members of the S-100 family have been identified. They vary in their target specificity, cell type distribution, and cell cycle regulation (21Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The best studied members of the S-100 family, S-100α and S-100β, have been shown to exist as both homodimers with themselves and heterodimers with each other. Their expression patterns differ; S-100α is predominantly found in muscle, whereas S-100β is highly expressed in cells within the nervous system (22Haimoto H. Hosoda S. Kato K. Lab. Invest. 1987; 57: 489-498PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zimmer D.B. Van Eldik L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C285-C289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kato K. Kimura S. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). S-100 proteins are believed to interact with many proteins, and the identification of several common targets with calmodulin suggests that a common structural domain mediates these interactions (27Baudier J.

We have previously shown that calcium-loaded calmodulin can selectively inhibit the DNA binding of E protein homodimers in vitro and that the calcium ionophore ionomycin inhibits their activity in vivo. In contrast, the heterodimers E12/MASH2 and E12/MyoD were either less sensitive or completely resistant (31Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Here we identify the protein sequences within the bHLH proteins that determine the differential inhibition by calmodulin. We show that this inhibition is the result of a physical interaction between the DNA binding basic sequence and calmodulin. Both E12 and MyoD basic sequences are capable of binding calmodulin. However, sequences directly N-terminal to the basic sequence inhibit this interaction in the case of MyoD. We show that S-100 proteins can also inhibit bHLH proteins through interaction with the basic sequence. S-100αα, S-100ββ, and calmodulin show distinct bHLH protein preferences, and these differential interactions are determined by the basic sequences and the directly N-terminal sequences. These results suggest that both calmodulin and S-100 proteins play roles in the differential regulation of bHLH proteins. Unless otherwise noted, all general laboratory chemicals were obtained through KEBO Lab (Spånga, Sweden). Radiochemicals were supplied by Amersham Corp. Constructs for in vitrotranslation and overexpression in Escherichia coli of chimeric E12/MyoD proteins were based on the previously described E12 and MyoD constructs (31Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Domain swapping was carried out by oligonucleotide-directed polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene). The first amino acids defining each region within the bHLH domain are as follows: for MyoD, basic sequence, 108; helix 1, 123; loop, 138; helix 2, 146; for E12, basic sequence, 277; helix 1, 292; loop, 307; helix 2, 317. Proteins were deleted at the N termini up to amino acids 102 (MyoD) and 272 (E12) by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. For in vitrotranslation, constructs were cloned into pSP64-poly(A)+(Promega). For overexpression in E. coli, constructs were cloned into a pET-20b+ derivative (Novagen) modified to include an N-terminal His6 tag (pET-20b+His). To maintain the frame, a glutamine was added between the tag and the N termini of E12ΔN and MyoD, and a leucine was added for MyoDΔN. The deleted SEF2–1 (amino acids 547–667), SEF2–1ΔN (amino acids 558–667), SEF2–1-bHLH (amino acids 563–622), and MASH2ΔN (amino acids 98–174) expression constructs were derived from previously described constructs (31Corneliussen B.

The nucleotide sequences of all polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA segments were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pETCaM, which contains the calmodulin-encoding sequences from pCaMRW (32Waltersson Y.

For reactions involving heterodimers, both partners were co-translated. The proteins were purified by heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia) chromatography (31Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recombinant bHLH proteins were expressed in the E. colistrain BL21(DE3) pLysS according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). 400 ml of cells were harvested after a 3-h induction and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mm of the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Cells were lysed by freeze-thawing followed by sonication, and soluble His-tagged proteins were purified by metal chelation chromatography on a Ni-nitrolotriacetic acid column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The manufacturer's suggested buffer, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and variable imidazole, was supplemented with 1% glycerol and 0.01% Triton X-100 (Boehringer Mannheim). SEF2–1 proteins were further purified by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (31Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the proteins were stored at −80 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Purity of the proteins was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein concentrations were calculated using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Calmodulin was overexpressed in E. coli in a corresponding manner. Cells were lysed with the aid of a French pressure cell (Aminco, Silver Springs, MD) at 30 megapascal pressure, and initial purification was achieved by heat denaturation and subsequent removal of E. coli proteins as described (33Gautel M. Castiglione Morelli M.A. Pfuhl M. Motta A. Pastore A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Soluble calmodulin was further purified to apparent homogeneity on DEAE-cellulose (DE-32, Whatman) and phenyl-Sepharose (Pharmacia) as described (32Waltersson Y. Linse S. Brodin P. Grundström T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7866-7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Purified calmodulin was dialyzed exhaustively against water and lyophilized, and the dry powder was stored at −20 °C. EMSAs were performed as described previously (34Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundström T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1625-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using an end-labeled DNA segment containing the binding site of the muscle creatine kinase enhancer (31Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). All calmodulin binding reactions were carried out in the presence of 0.1 mm CaCl2. Recombinant proteins were diluted in 2 × calmodulin binding buffer (31Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with the addition of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) prior to the reaction and premixed at room temperature for 10 min to allow heterodimer formation. Reactions were performed in the presence of S-100 proteins (Sigma), recombinant calmodulin, or calbindin D9K (35Brodin P. Drakenberg T. Thulin E. Forsen S. Grundström T. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) where indicated. Synthetic peptides were custom synthesized by the biotechnology facility at Uppsala University (SEF2–1 peptide b), by AMS Biotechnology Ltd. (Täby, Sweden) (MyoD peptide b), or by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). The peptide sequences were as follows: SEF2–1 peptide b, KERRMANNARERLRVRGGCGY; peptide bH, NARERLRVRDINEAFKGY; peptide H1, RDINEAFKELGRMVQLGY; peptide H2, KLLILHQAVAVILSLEGY; and MyoD peptide b, ADRRKAATMRERRRLGGCGY. Lyophilized recombinant calmodulin was resuspended at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 10 mmNaHCO3, pH 10, and dansylated calmodulin (5-(dimethylamino)naphtalene-1-sulfonylcalmodulin) was prepared using standard procedures (36Kincaid R.L. Vaughan M. Osborne Jr., J.C. Tkachuk V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10638-10643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of proteins to dansylated calmodulin was monitored by spectrofluorimetry using a Shimadzu RF5000 spectrofluorimeter. Dansyl-calmodulin was excited at 340 nm, and the emission at 490 nm was recorded. Unless otherwise indicated, all reactions were performed in 3 ml of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 3 μm CaCl2 and 75 nm dansylated calmodulin. Proteins were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with dansylated calmodulin prior to each measurement. Binding constants, K D, were estimated from the titration curves using a simple binding model and the equation, θ=*Ct+Pt+KD*−*Ct+Pt+KD*2−4PtCt2CtEquation 1 where P t is total added bHLH protein,C t is total calmodulin, and θ is the fractional saturation (F −F 0)/(F max −F 0). We have previously shown that E12 and SEF2–1 homodimers display a calcium/calmodulin-dependent inhibition of DNA binding in an EMSA, whereas E12/MyoD heterodimers are completely resistant. For SEF2–1, we localized the calcium/calmodulin sensitivity to the bHLH domain (31Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To further characterize this differential calmodulin sensitivity, the DNA binding of in vitro translated derivatives of E12 and MyoD proteins was assayed in the presence and absence of calmodulin as shown in Fig.1. As expected, DNA binding of an N-terminally deleted derivative of E12 homodimers was inhibited upon preincubation with calmodulin, whereas heterodimers of a deletion derivative of MyoD with E12 remained unaffected by 2.5 μmcalmodulin. The calmodulin sensitivity of E12 was further localized to a shortened fragment of E12, E12ΔN, that includes the bHLH domain but lacks all except five amino acids N-terminal to it (Fig. 1). To determine the regions of E12 and MyoD responsible for sensitivity/resistance to calmodulin, E12/MyoD chimeric proteins were constructed. The chimeras (Fig. 1) were designed so that regions within the bHLH domain of the E12 derivative were replaced with analogous regions from the deletion derivative of MyoD, producing chimeras M12 I to M12 V. Analysis of the chimeric proteins showed that only sequences N-terminal of helix 1 were important for determining the sensitivity of E12 to calmodulin; homodimers of M12 III, where the HLH region of E12 was replaced by that of MyoD, showed inhibition of DNA binding upon preincubation with calcium-loaded calmodulin (Fig. 1). The reciprocal chimera, M12 IV, which has a MyoD basic sequence followed by the E12 HLH, resulted in a protein that, when heterodimerized with the E12, showed no inhibition of DNA binding (Fig. 1). One interpretation of these results is that sequences N-terminal to helix 1 are responsible for calmodulin sensitivity. Alternatively, homodimers could be sensitive, whereas heterodimers could be resistant. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we repeated selected experiments withE. coli-produced proteins. Due to the higher protein concentration that could be achieved, analysis of DNA binding of homodimers was possible with recombinant MyoD and M12 IV. Both recombinant MyoD and M12 IV homodimers were resistant to calmodulin inhibition, in contrast to E12 and M12 III homodimers (Fig. 1), showing that it is not homo- or heterodimerization that determines calmodulin sensitivity. From these results, we conclude that sequences N-terminal of helix 1 are responsible for determining resistance or sensitivity to calmodulin. Dansylated calmodulin undergoes a change in emitted fluorescence upon binding to a target (36Kincaid R.L. Vaughan M. Osborne Jr., J.C. Tkachuk V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10638-10643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monitoring this fluorescence change can be used to determine the affinity of calmodulin for the target. Dansylated calmodulin was titrated with the bHLH domain of SEF2–1 (amino acids 563–622; Ref. 31Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and the emitted fluorescent light was recorded (Fig. 2). SEF2–1-bHLH bound to dansylated calmodulin with high affinity, and saturation was reached (Fig. 2 B). The binding characteristics were similar to those of longer versions of SEF2–1 and E12 (data not shown), indicating that all sequences required for efficient calmodulin binding are contained within the bHLH domain. There is no change in fluorescence of dansylated calmodulin upon the addition of bHLH protein in the absence of calcium. To further determine sequences responsible for calmodulin binding, synthetic peptides derived from bHLH protein sequences were analyzed by the same assay. Since it has previously been shown for SEF2–1 that its bHLH domain (SEF2–1-bHLH) retains its sensitivity to calmodulin (31Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and its ability to bind dansylated calmodulin (Fig. 2 B), only sequences within the bHLH domain were considered. Well characterized calmodulin targets interact with calmodulin via a short basic and amphipathic α-helix (37O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The basic sequence of the bHLH proteins is an α-helix, at least in the DNA complex (38Ma P.C. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 39Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Therefore, with the exception of the central loop, bHLH domains are composed of sequences that fulfill at least some of the criteria of a calmodulin target. We therefore designed peptides covering those sequences. Fig. 2 A shows SEF2–1-bHLH and illustrates the sequences spanned by the synthetic peptides. Of these peptides, only peptide b, representing the basic sequence, bound with high affinity to dansylated calmodulin. Peptide bH bound to calmodulin to a much lower extent, and peptides H1 and H2 did not bind at the concentrations used (Fig. 2 B). This strongly suggests that the sequence corresponding to peptide b, the basic sequence of SEF2–1, is the primary target for calmodulin binding. The basic sequence of a bHLH protein can bind calmodulin, and sequences N-terminal to helix 1, including the basic sequence, determine calmodulin sensitivity in a DNA binding assay. Taken together, this suggests that the binding of calmodulin to the DNA-interacting basic sequence of a bHLH protein inhibits its binding to DNA. To further investigate this hypothesis, we tested whether there is a correlation between the degree of calmodulin inhibition of the DNA binding of a bHLH protein and its affinity for calmodulin. To that effect, we took a semiquantitative approach to analysis of DNA binding inhibition using homodimers of E. coli-produced bHLH proteins. A series of chimeric E12/MyoD bHLH proteins (Fig. 3 A) were preincubated with various concentrations of calcium-loaded calmodulin, and inhibition constants (K i) were estimated from the concentration of calmodulin necessary to achieve 50% inhibition of DNA binding. Typical results are shown in Fig. 3 B, and the average results are summarized in Fig. 3 C. In a separate set of experiments, dansylated calmodulin was titrated with the above analyzed bHLH proteins, and the affinity constants (K D) were determined using the simple binding model described under “Materials and Methods.” The numbersshown in Fig. 3 C are the averages of three separate titrations, with the values agreeing to within 25%. Titration curves of three representative proteins, E12, MyoDΔN, and MyoD, with strong, intermediate, and no calmodulin binding, respectively, are shown in Fig. 3 D. All binding curves showed systematic deviations from the theoretical titration curve for simple binding, indicating that the binding process is more complex. This will be discussed elsewhere. 2S. Hermann, J. Onions, and T. Grundström, manuscript in preparation. The bHLH proteins that were resistant to calmodulin inhibition did not bind dansylated calmodulin at the concentrations used (Fig. 3 C). All bHLH proteins that were inhibited by calmodulin could also be shown to directly bind to calmodulin. Within the resolutions of these methods, the estimated K i values correlated directly with the measured affinity constants, K D. This is consistent with the notion that it is the physical interaction with calmodulin that renders a bHLH protein incapable of DNA binding. MyoD-E12basic and E12-MyoDbasic, with the basic sequences interchanged, behaved as MyoD and E12, respectively, both in the calmodulin sensitivity and the calmodulin binding assay (Fig. 3). This suggested that the MyoD basic sequence is as good a calmodulin binding sequence as that of E12 but that additional MyoD sequences inhibit this calmodulin binding ability. To directly test whether the basic sequence of MyoD can bind calmodulin but is prevented from doing so by inhibitory N-terminal sequences, an additional construct was made, MyoDΔN, deleting most of the N-terminal sequences of MyoD. This variant was able to bind calmodulin, and its DNA binding could be inhibited by calmodulin (Fig. 3). Inhibition of MyoDΔN as well as all other bHLH proteins tested was dependent on calcium. Replacing calcium with the chelator EGTA completely abolished the calmodulin inhibition of bHLH proteins (data not shown). To investigate the role of the N-terminal sequences more closely, we replaced the sequences directly N-terminal to the basic sequence of E12 with those of MyoD in MyoDN-E12 and vice versa in E12N-MyoD. The origin of the directly N-terminal sequences was found to determine calmodulin binding and sensitivity. MyoDN-E12, the chimeric protein with the N-terminal sequences derived from MyoD, did not bind calmodulin and was calmodulin-resistant, whereas E12N-MyoD, the chimeric protein with the N-terminal sequences derived from E12, bound to calmodulin and was calmodulin-sensitive (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results show that the bHLH sequences of both the calmodulin-sensitive bHLH proteins and the calmodulin-resistant MyoD are targets for calmodulin binding and that MyoD contains sequences directly N-terminal to the basic sequence that inhibit interaction with calmodulin. It was previously shown that the inhibition of DNA binding of bHLH proteins was not a general property of all calcium-binding proteins, since calbindin D9K was not inhibitory (31Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This, however, does not exclude the possibility that there are calcium-binding proteins in addition to calmodulin that also interact with bHLH proteins. S-100 proteins have several targets in common with calmodulin (27Baudier J. Mochly Rosen D. Newton A. Lee S.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Cole R.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 28Baudier J. Bergeret E. Bertacchi N. Weintraub H. Gagnon J. Garin J.

We therefore preincubated various bHLH homodimers and heterodimers with calmodulin, S-100αα, S-100αβ, S-100ββ, or calbindin D9k and analyzed their effects on bHLH DNA binding activity. Representative results are shown in Fig.4. The calmodulin-sensitive E12ΔN and SEF2–1ΔN homodimers showed high sensitivity also to S-100 proteins but were unaffected by calbindin D9k. Interestingly, a differential sensitivity was observed. SEF2–1ΔN showed the highest sensitivity toward the S-100 proteins, whereas E12ΔN was more sensitive to calmodulin and S-100αα than to S-100αβ and S-100ββ. E12ΔN/MyoDΔN heterodimers were resistant to calbindin D9k and slightly sensitive to calmodulin, S-100αβ, and S-100ββ but surprisingly showed greater sensitivity to S-100αα. Homodimers of MyoDΔN displayed properties similar to those shown by the heterodimer with E12ΔN except that they displayed extremely efficient inhibition by S-100αα. The differential sensitivity seen for the E12ΔN/MyoDΔN heterodimer did not appear to be a property of all heterodimers between class A and class B proteins, since E12ΔN/MASH2ΔN was equally sensitive to calmodulin and the S-100 proteins (Fig. 4). Calmodulin inhibits DNA binding of bHLH proteins through binding to their basic sequence. To analyze if S-100 proteins act in a similar way, we first investigated whether S-100 could bind to bHLH proteins. For technical reasons, an indirect approach was chosen. Dansylated calmodulin was half-saturated with the bHLH protein, and the preformed complex was then challenged with increasing concentrations of unmodified calmodulin or S-100αβ. Relative affinities of calmodulin and S-100αβ were estimated from their ability to compete with dansylated calmodulin for the binding of"
https://openalex.org/W1971892123,"This report describes the cloning of cDNAs encoding transmembrane and soluble isoforms of a novel chain of the murine type I interferon (IFN) receptor and characterization of its capability to bind ligand and transduce signals. The transmembrane receptor (murine IFNAR 2c) has an extracellular domain of 215 amino acids and an intracellular domain of 250 amino acids, with 48% amino acid and 71% nucleotide identity with human IFNAR 2c. The cDNA for the soluble murine receptor (IFNAR 2a) encodes a 221-amino acid polypeptide identical to the first 210 amino acids of IFNAR 2c plus a novel 11 amino acids. Northern blot analyses show that murine IFNAR 2 is expressed as two transcripts of 4 kilobases encoding the transmembrane isoform and 1.5 kilobases encoding the more abundant soluble isoform. Studies using primary murine cells that lack IFNAR 1 show that IFNAR 2 is expressed, and cells bind type I IFN ligand, but do not transduce signals as detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assays of ISGF3 or GAF complexes binding to their cognate oligonucleotides. These cells show no effects on the ability of IFNγ to activate these complexes. These studies demonstrate that the IFNAR 2 transmembrane (2c) and soluble (2a) isoforms are conserved between the human and mouse and that IFNAR 2c has intrinsic ligand binding activity, but no intrinsic signal transducing activity as measured in this study.

Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). The human type I IFNs include multiple subtypes of IFNα, a single IFNβ, and in some species IFNϖ and -τ (2Weissman C. Weber H. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1986; 33: 251-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 3Roberts R.M. Cross J.C. Farin P.W. Kramer K.K. Francis H. Librach C. Fisher S.J. Schemberg D.W. Growth Factors in Reproduction. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, FRG1991: 235-245Crossref Google Scholar). The structure of type I IFNs is highly conserved, ranging from 70–98% amino acid identity between IFNα subtypes to 35% identity between IFNα and IFNβ (2Weissman C. Weber H. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1986; 33: 251-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Not only are type I IFNs structurally and functionally related, but they also compete with each other for receptor binding and therefore share one or more common receptor component(s) (4Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 25: 3-26Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although two components of the human type I IFN receptor have been cloned, their role in ligand binding and signal transduction remains unclear. The first component of the type I IFN receptor to be cloned was human IFNAR 1 (5Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I. Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) which was shown to mediate response to one human IFN subtype α8, but not α2, nor β when its cDNA was expressed in murine TG 9A cells (5Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I. Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated binding of type I IFNs to IFNAR 1 when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes (6Lim J.-K. Xiong J. Carrasco N. Langer J.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or in simian COS cells (7Hwang S.Y. Holland K.A. Kola I. Hertzog P.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). By contrast, no binding of type I IFNs to IFNAR 1 was detected when IFNAR 1 was expressed in murine L929 cells (8Colamonici O.R. Porterfield B. Domanski P. Constantinescu S. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 9598-9602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or hamster CHO cells (9Soh J. Mariano T.M. Lim J.-K. Izotova J. Mirochnitchenko O. Schwartz B. Langer J.A. Pestka S. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21045-21051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, in view of these contradictory data, the role of IFNAR 1 in ligand binding remains uncertain. One possible explanation for the discrepancy between these studies may be that the human IFNAR 1 receptor component was expressed in various heterologous cell backgrounds which may either process human IFNAR 1 differently or may interact with the transfected component differently via its endogenous IFNAR chains. To define the function of receptor components clearly it would be an advantage to study the receptor function in a homologous background and without interference from other heterologous receptor components. The cDNA encoding a second component of the human type I IFN receptor complex was cloned (11Novick D. Cohen B. Rubenstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and is now designated IFNAR 2. Subsequent studies have identified that the human IFNAR 2 gene encodes multiple mRNA transcripts which are translated into several isoforms: a soluble form designated as IFNAR 2a (11Novick D. Cohen B. Rubenstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 12Lutfalla G. Holland S.J. Cinato E. Monneron D. Reboul J. Rogers N.C. Smith J.M. Stark G.R.

Monneron D. Reboul J. Rogers N.C. Smith J.M. Stark G.R. Gardiner K. Mogensen K.E. Kerr I.M. Uzé G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 101-109Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 13Domanski P. Witte M. Kellum M.

Although the original report proposed IFNAR 2b to be the signaling subunit (11Novick D. Cohen B. Rubenstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), subsequent studies proposed that IFNAR 2c possessed signaling activity not present in IFNAR 2b (12Lutfalla G. Holland S.J. Cinato E. Monneron D. Reboul J. Rogers N.C. Smith J.M. Stark G.R. Gardiner K. Mogensen K.E. Kerr I.M. Uzé G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 101-109Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The reason for the existence of two transmembrane isoforms of IFNAR 2 remains unknown. Indeed the extent to which any isoforms of IFNAR 2 are expressed other than in a few cell lines derived from human tumors also remains unknown. Co-expression of human cDNAs encoding IFNAR 1 and IFNAR 2 in murine 3T3 cells gives higher binding of ligand than when either chain alone is expressed (14Russell-Harde D. Pu H. Betts M. Harkins R.N. Perez H.D. Croze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but the contribution of endogenous receptor chains from the host cell as discussed above complicates interpretation of these experiments. Thus the importance of the multiple isoforms of human IFNAR 2 and their roles in ligand binding and signal transduction is still unclear. To resolve these problems, we have undertaken to study the murine type I IFN system which is analogous to the human system in that it contains multiple IFNα subtypes and a single IFNβ (2Weissman C. Weber H. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1986; 33: 251-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and murine IFNAR 1 is homologous to human IFNAR 1 (15Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Bandu M.T. Proudhon D. Mogensen K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4774-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The study of the IFN system in the mouse has several advantages. In particular the availability of transgenic and gene knock-out technology will enable functional studies on receptor function in vivo in physiological and pathological conditions. For example earlier studies by us (16Hwang S.Y. Hertzog P.J. Holland K.A. Sumarsono S.H. Tymms M.J. Hamilton J.A. Whitty G. Bertoncello I. Kola I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11284-11288Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and others (17Müller M. Steinhoff U. Reis L.F.L. Hemmi S. Pavlovic J. Zinkernagel R.M. Aguet M. Science. 1994; 264: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar) of IFNAR 1 −/− mice demonstrated the importance of type I IFNs in antiviral defense and hemopoiesis. Furthermore the availability of cells from receptor knock-out mice will enable the study of one receptor component in cells where another component is absent. The comparison of data from the mouse and human system will also enable the identification of important isoforms or critical functional residues which are likely to be conserved across species. In the present study we describe the cloning of two cDNAs encoding transmembrane and soluble isoforms of the second murine type I IFN receptor chain, IFNAR 2, which is highly homologous to the human IFNAR 2c and 2a isoforms, respectively. In addition, we report the conserved structural features of this receptor chain, demonstrate the expression of IFNAR 2 transcripts in normal adult mouse tissues, and demonstrate that when IFNAR 2 is expressed in primary cells in the absence of IFNAR 1 it has intrinsic binding activity, but alone does not transduce signals, as measured herein. The murine interferons used in these studies were obtained from the following sources: recombinant murine IFNβ, Toray Industries, Tokyo, Japan; natural murine IFNβ and mixed IFNα subtypes, Lee Biomolecular, Los Angeles, CA; recombinant murine IFNα, Life Technologies, Inc. Murine L cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Embryo fibroblast cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin as above. BMM were produced by culture of bone marrow aspirates in RPMI 1640 supplemented with fetal calf serum, L-cell conditioned medium, and colony-stimulating factor 1 for 7–8 days as described previously (18Hamilton J.A. Whitty G.A. Kola I. Hertzog P.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2533-2557Google Scholar). A mouse testis cDNA library (CLONTECH) was screened with a 757-bp huIFNAR 2 cDNA probe (nucleotides 410 to 1167 of published sequence (11Novick D. Cohen B. Rubenstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Two identical clones containing 1598 bp of insert were obtained after tertiary screens and sequenced using an automated sequencing machine (Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer). The sequence of the insert corresponds to the sequence from nucleotides 622 to 2220 of human IFNAR 2a (Fig. 1). To obtain the rest of the sequence a 554-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 622 to 1176 was generated by PCR and used to screen a mouse lung cDNA library (Stratagene). After three rounds of screening, a clone containing an approximately 3-kb insert was obtained, and both strands of the insert were sequenced as above. The sequence (Fig. 1) contains a full open reading frame (513 amino acids) which included virtually the same sequence as the clone from the testis library. An adult mouse liver cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened using a radiolabeled probe encoding the entire coding region of the transmembrane isoform of the muIFNAR 2. After three rounds of screening 14 positive clones were obtained, two of which encoded the transmembrane isoform of muIFNAR 2c. The remaining clones encoded an isoform of murine IFNAR 2 that is predicted to encode a soluble receptor. Poly(A)+ mRNA from cell lines, BMM, or organs was prepared by a modification of a published method (19Gonda T.J. Sheiness D.K. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 614-617Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ mRNA (3 μg) was denatured with formamide, fractionated on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.67% formaldehyde, and electrophoresed in buffer containing 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mM EDTA, then transferred to Hybond-C Extra (Amersham) membranes in 20 × SSC according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were hybridized with a 32P-labeled murine IFNAR 2 cDNA, then stripped and rehybridized with a labeled 1.1-kb glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe as described previously (20Hertzog P.J.

Murine IFNβ (Toray Industries) was iodinated by incubation for 60 min with 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent (ICN) (21Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). The antiviral activity of the labeled IFN was determined to be unchanged as tested in a standard cytopathic effect-reduction bioassay using murine L cells and Semliki Forest virus essentially as described previously (22Hertzog P.J. Wright A. Harris G. Linnane A.W. Mackay I.R. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1991; 58: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Receptor binding assays were performed using murine L cells or adherent BMM by incubation of125I-IFNβ with or without a 300-fold excess of unlabeled muIFNβ for 2 h at 20 °C essentially as described previously (20Hertzog P.J.

EMSA assays were performed on primary embryo fibroblasts obtained from IFNAR 1 homozygous normal (+/+), heterozygous (+/−), or homozygous null mutant (−/−) mice (16Hwang S.Y. Hertzog P.J. Holland K.A. Sumarsono S.H. Tymms M.J. Hamilton J.A. Whitty G. Bertoncello I. Kola I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11284-11288Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The cell lines were untreated or treated with recombinant muIFNα (100 IU/ml) or IFNγ (500 IU/ml) for 1 h, nuclear lysates were prepared, and EMSA was performed using oligonucleotides from the ISG15 IFN-sensitive response element (ISRE) and/or the interferon response factor 1 γ activation sequence (GAS) element as described previously (23Kotanides H.

To identify the components of bands on gel shifts, antibodies were incubated with the nuclear extracts at room temperature for 1 h prior to the addition of probe. The extracts contained no antibody, 3 μg of normal rabbit immunoglobulin, 3 μg of rabbit anti-human STAT-1 Ig (protein G-purified (25Kotanides H. Reich N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25555-25561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)), 1 μg of rabbit anti-human STAT-2 Ig (n-17, Santa Cruz), 3 μg of anti-murine STAT-3 Ig (C-20, Santa Cruz), or 3 μl of rabbit anti-human serum. The antiviral activity of murine IFNβ or IFNα subtypes (Lee Biomolecular, Los Angeles, CA) was tested on primary embryo fibroblast cell lines derived from muIFNAR 1 +/+, +/−, or −/− mice by incubation with IFN concentrations ranging from 20 to 3,000 units/ml, overnight, then for 3 days with Semliki forest virus. Cell viability was determined by staining with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye (26Loveland B.E. Johns T.G. Mackay I.R. Vaillant F. Wang Z.-X. Hertzog P.J. Biochem. Int. 1992; 27: 501-510PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence of the approximately 3-kb clone obtained from the mouse lung library is shown in Fig. 1 A. It comprises 108 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated sequence, a 1539-nucleotide open reading frame, 824 nucleotides of 3′-untranslated sequence, and a polyadenylation sequence at nucleotides 2340 to 2345. The 1.6-kb clones obtained from the mouse testis library were identical in sequence from nucleotide 622 to nucleotide 2220, except A (lung) → G (testis) at 1124, C → T at 1163, and G → A at 1394. The open reading frame encodes a 513-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted 27-amino acid leader sequence (boxed, Fig. 1 A) and hydrophobic transmembrane domain of 21 amino acids (boxed andshaded, Fig. 1 A). Thus the murine IFNAR 2 would have an extracellular domain of 215 amino acids with 8 potentialN-glycosylation sites (underlined, Fig.1 A), a fibronectin-like cell attachment sequence, RGD, at residues 115 to 117, and 7 cysteine residues. The long intracellular domain contains 250 amino acids with 6 tyrosine residues, a potential cAMP/GMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site at Ser-403, 8 potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites at Thr-44, Thr-88, Thr-96, Thr-158, Ser-180, Thr-306, Thr-341, Ser-194, 16 potential casein kinase II phosphorylation sites at Ser-29, Ser-74, Ser-91, Ser-293, Ser-321, Ser-323, Thr-336, Ser-354, Ser-364, Ser-403, Ser-415, Ser-416, Ser-448, Thr-463, Ser-500, Ser-502, and potential N-myristylation sites at Gly-233, -237, -245, -365, -373, -387, and -471. The murine IFNAR 2 shows 48% amino acid identity overall with the human IFNAR 2c and 71% nucleotide identity (Fig. 1 B). A comparison of the murine and human IFNAR 2c amino acid sequences (Fig.1 B) shows that the cysteine residues are conserved between human and mouse except an extra C in muIFNAR 2 at amino acid residue 121. Intracellular tyrosine residues Tyr-268, Tyr-315, Tyr-317, Tyr-335, and Tyr-510 are conserved, but Tyr-306 and Tyr-411 are present in human not mouse, and Tyr-398 is present in mouse not human. Since functionally important residues are more likely to be conserved across species, the former tyrosines are likely to be the important ones, for example in phosphorylation associated with signal transduction. The degree of amino acid sequence identity between the murine and human IFNAR 2 is similar to that between murine and human IFNAR 1, namely 48 and 46%, respectively. Several cDNA clones encoding a soluble isoform of IFNAR 2 were isolated from the libraries (12 of 14 clones analyzed), the sequence of a 1045-bp clone is shown in Fig. 2. This isoform is designated muIFNAR 2a because of its similarity with the soluble human isoform, huIFNAR 2a. The predicted amino acid sequence derived from the coding cDNA sequence is identical to the sequence of muIFNAR 2c for the first 237 amino acids (including the signal sequence) and contains an additional 11 amino acids which are specific to this isoform (Fig. 2). Northern blot analysis of mRNA from normal mouse liver and placenta using a full-length murine IFNAR 2 cDNA probe indicates two major transcripts of approximately 4.0 and 1.5 kb in size (Fig. 3 A), similar to the sizes reported for human IFNAR 2 transcripts. An identical filter was simultaneously hybridized with a probe encompassing nucleotides 917–1579 of the cDNA which encodes the cytoplasmic domain of murine IFNAR 2c. This cytoplasmic domain probe hybridized with only the larger 4.0-kb transcript. Hybridization with a probe that contained nucleotides 913 to 1012 of the IFNAR 2a cDNA detected only the 1.5-kb band. This probe contained nucleotide sequences that are absent in the IFNAR 2c cDNA, namely the 3′-untranslated region and the nucleotides encoding the soluble-specific amino acids. These data indicate that the 1.5-kb transcript contains mRNA encoding the soluble muIFNAR 2a, whereas the 4.0-kb transcript encodes the transmembrane IFNAR 2c. This situation appears to be different from the human in which the soluble receptor isoform is encoded by a 4-kb transcript, whereas the shorter transcript encodes the short C-terminally truncated transmembrane isoform, IFNAR 2b (12Lutfalla G. Holland S.J. Cinato E. Monneron D. Reboul J. Rogers N.C. Smith J.M. Stark G.R. Gardiner K. Mogensen K.E. Kerr I.M. Uzé G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 101-109Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we are yet to isolate any murine cDNA clones homologous to the short C-terminally truncated transmembrane human IFNAR 2b isoform (from more than 20 clones from three different cDNA libraries). Because the human IFNAR 2b is proposed to have arisen because of an Alu sequence in the gene (27Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 815-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the existence of this isoform may be specific to human species. Northern blot analyses of poly(A)+ mRNA obtained from several organs of adult mice show that both the 4.0- and 1.5-kb transcripts are present in all tissues (Fig. 3 B), as is also the case in the murine cell lines examined (data not shown). Occasionally a weak, larger transcript was observed at about 9 kb in some organs (e.g. liver, thymus, lung, Fig. 3 B); this may represent unprocessed mRNA or another, minor transcript. It is notable from the Northern blots that the 1.5-kb transcript was more intense relative to the 4-kb transcript in most tissues analyzed, implying that the soluble receptor encoded by this transcript may be functionally important. To perform functional studies on murine IFNAR 2, we have utilized the murine IFNAR 1 −/− mice previously generated in our laboratory (16Hwang S.Y. Hertzog P.J. Holland K.A. Sumarsono S.H. Tymms M.J. Hamilton J.A. Whitty G. Bertoncello I. Kola I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11284-11288Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, BMM derived from IFNAR 1 +/+, +/−, and −/− mice express both the 1.5- and 4.0-kb transcripts of murine IFNAR 2 at similar proportions to each other and relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Thus these cells provide an ideal opportunity to examine the function of IFNAR 2 in a primary cell line in the presence or absence of IFNAR 1. While murine IFNs have proven difficult to radiolabel with125I, we have succeeded in labeling murine IFNβ which maintained biological activity for a sufficient time to perform binding assays. This type I IFN bound specifically to BMM in a dose-dependent manner. However, the ability of BMM to bind125I-labeled murine IFNβ is reduced in IFNAR 1 −/− cells to approximately one-half that in IFNAR 1 +/+ cells (Fig.4 B). These data imply that murine IFNAR 1 contributes to ligand binding, but in its absence, IFNAR 2 is expressed and significant binding of ligand occurs. Because primary BMM still bind type I IFN in the absence of IFNAR 1, and because the IFNAR 2 chain was still expressed, the question arises whether a signal can be transduced in response to the bound type I IFN in IFNAR 1 −/− cells? We have previously shown that primary embryo fibroblast (PEF) cell lines were sensitive to the antiviral responses of type I IFNs, so we have used these cell lines to examine signal transduction by testing for the formation of the transcriptional activation complexes, ISGF3 (IFN-stimulated gene factor) and GAF (γ activated factor) following treatment with murine IFNα and as a control, IFNγ. EMSA studies show that IFNα induces the formation of an ISGF 3 complex in IFNAR 1 +/+ PEF (Fig.5 A), but in IFNAR 1 −/− PEF there is no formation of the ISGF3 complex after induction by IFNα (Fig. 5 B). It was surprising to find evidence of a low level of ISGF3 formation and binding to its cognate element after IFNγ treatment of both IFNAR 1 +/+ and −/− cells (Fig. 5, A andB). Nevertheless, this IFNγ-induced ISGF3 formation was reproducible, and its formation in IFNAR 1 −/− cells in response to IFNγ discounts any indirect induction of ISGF3 via IFNα or -β production. The identity of the “shifted” bands in Fig. 5,A and B, were confirmed by preincubation with antibodies to STAT-1 and STAT-2 and subsequent reduction in the intensity of the ISGF 3 band (Fig. 5, C and D). Antibodies to human p48 also produced a minor reduction in intensity of the ISGF3 band formed in response to IFNα or -γ (data not shown). As expected, activation of GAF binding to the GAS element after induction by IFNγ was similar in IFNAR 1 +/+ and IFNAR 1 −/− cells (Fig. 6, A and B). By contrast, the induction of GAF in response to IFNα was observed in IFNAR +/+ PEF (Fig. 6 A), but not in IFNAR 1 −/− cells (Fig. 6 B). The multiple bands of GAF represent STAT-1 and STAT-3 homo- and heterodimers as shown by preincubation of extracts with antibodies to these factors (Fig. 6, C andD). The specificity of the binding of the transcription factor complexes is demonstrated by the competitive inhibition by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. These results demonstrate that IFNAR 2 alone (in the absence of IFNAR 1) is unable to transduce the signal(s) required to activate the formation of ISGF3 or GAF, even though it is sufficient to mediate significant binding of the type I IFN ligand. The results provided herein detail the cloning and characterization of the transmembrane and soluble forms of the murine type I IFN receptor which shows significant homology with the human receptor, IFNAR 2. The conservation of important structural motifs in the extracellular domain such as the number and location of cysteine residues probably indicates their importance in forming intramolecular disulfide bonds to maintain the appropriate folding required for ligand interaction. This similarity in architecture of murine IFNAR 2 places it in the class 2 family of cytokines, along with all other IFN receptor chains. In the intracellular domain of IFNAR 2 there are several putative sites for interaction with candidate signaling molecules, but the definition of these will require extensive studies using mutation of potential active sites. Among these are 5 tyrosine residues which are conserved with the human IFNAR 2 isoform, since these are potential targets for phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases and docking of signaling molecules such as JAK kinases and STAT proteins (28Constantinescu S. Croze E. Wang C. Murti A. Basu L. Mullersman J. Pfeffer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9602-9606Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The species conservation highlights these residues as the most likely to be functionally important. Furthermore the conservation of a soluble form of this receptor suggests that it may also have an important biological function. For many cytokine receptors it has been demonstrated that two or three chains constitute the functional receptor. These chains have been defined as primary ligand binding (or α) chains, accessory (non-binding or β), or signal transducing or co-binding chains (29Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1993; 74: 587-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This definition has been an important step in understanding how the receptor works in ligand interaction and signal transduction and in defining the action of soluble receptors (e.g. whether they inhibit interaction with a functional receptor or facilitate interaction by presenting the ligand to an accessory or transducing chain). However, as yet there has been no convincing definition of the role of the receptor chains in the type I IFN system. The availability of IFNAR 1 −/− mice from our previous work provides an ideal opportunity to study the function of IFNAR 2 in primary cells lacking the other component. In this study we have shown that in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages which lack IFNAR 1, but express IFNAR 2, there is significant binding of ligand. These data indicate for the first time, unequivocally, the intrinsic ligand binding capability of IFNAR 2. The observation that binding is reduced in IFNAR 1 −/− cells relative to IFNAR 1 +/+ cells indicates clearly that IFNAR 1 also contributes to binding. This result also clarifies the contradictory data from human studies of the role of IFNAR 1 in ligand binding (see introduction). Our studies show that despite this intrinsic ligand binding activity, IFNAR 2 cannot transduce signals in the absence of IFNAR 1. Co-expression of both receptor chains is therefore necessary for these signals to be transduced. We demonstrated that IFNα activated the formation of the classical ISGF3 complex as well as GAS-binding factors that contained STAT-1 and STAT-3. However none of these activated factors were observed in IFNAR 1 −/− cells despite IFN binding to these cells. IFNγ signaling was intact in PEF cells independent of the presence or absence of IFNAR 1. It was particularly noteworthy that IFNγ signaling was demonstrated not only by the conventional activation of GAS-binding factors but also by activation of ISGF3, the identity of which was demonstrated and confirmed with appropriate antibodies. This is the first demonstration that ISGF3 can be activated in response to IFNγ, and its presence in IFNAR 1 −/− cells rules out the possibility that it could be due to activation of IFNα signaling. The existence of two isoforms of murine IFNAR 2 is different from the situation in humans where there are three isoforms including abundant transcripts of a short transmembrane isoform, IFNAR 2b. The screening of several murine cDNA libraries has so far failed to detect a murine IFNAR 2b, 2C. M. Owczarek, S. Y. Hwang, K. A. Holland, L. M. Gulluyan, M. Tavaria, B. Weaver, N. C. Reich, I. Kola, and P. J. Hertzog, unpublished data. so the existence of this isoform may be restricted to the human where this transcript arises because of an Alu sequence in the human gene (27Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 815-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus the murine mRNA transcripts of IFNAR 2 appear to be different from those of human, in which case the IFNAR 2c is encoded by a large (approximately 4.0 kb) and a small (approximately 1.7 kb) transcript, IFNAR 2a is encoded by a 4.0-kb transcript, and IFNAR 2b is encoded by the smaller transcript (12Lutfalla G. Holland S.J. Cinato E. Monneron D. Reboul J. Rogers N.C. Smith J.M. Stark G.R. Gardiner K. Mogensen K.E. Kerr I.M. Uzé G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 101-109Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However it should also be noted that the results for human IFNAR 2 expression were obtained using a tumor-derived cell line, whereas our current results represent the first studies of IFNAR 2 expression in normal adult organs. Our data also indicate that the shorter transcript is the more abundant of the two in most tissues analyzed. Confirmation of similar differences in expression for the different IFNAR 2 isoforms at the protein level would suggest an important role for the soluble receptor in regulating the IFN response. The likelihood that a soluble isoform has biological activity is strengthened by our finding that the transmembrane isoform of IFNAR 2 has intrinsic ligand binding activity, thereby enhancing the probability that the soluble isoform will also bind ligand. Thus this study demonstrates the sequence and important characteristics of murine IFNAR 2 as having a major role in binding type I IFN ligand but requiring the cooperation of IFNAR 1 for complete binding and signal transduction. These results will form the basis for significant future studies on understanding the regulation of the type I IFN systemin vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2158541834,"Many integrin adhesion receptors bind ligands containing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide motif. Most integrins exhibit considerable specificity for particular ligands and can distinguish among the many conformations of RGD. In this study we identify the domain of the integrin β subunit involved in determining ligand binding specificity. Chimeras of β3 and β5, the most homologous integrin β subunits, were expressed with αv on the surface of human 293 cells. The ligand binding phenotype of each chimera was assessed using the ligands Fab-9 and fibrinogen, both of which have a binding preference for αvβ3. The results of the study show that when exons C and D of the β3 subunit (residues 95–233) are substituted into β5, the chimera gained the ability to bind Fab-9 with an affinity close to that of wild-type αvβ3. This chimera was able to mediate cell adhesion to fibrinogen. Furthermore, the swap of only a 39-residue segment of this larger domain, β3 residues 164–202, into the backbone of β5 enabled the chimeric integrin to bind soluble Fab-9. This small domain is highly divergent among the integrin β subunits, suggesting that it may play a role in determining ligand selection by all integrins.

Integrins are transmembrane αβ heterodimers that are responsible for most of the physical contacts between cells and the extracellular matrix. Integrins are involved in a number of tissue remodeling events including embryogenesis, angiogenesis, wound repair, and bone resorption (1Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2868-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 2Duband J.L. Rocher S. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. Thiery J.P. J.

Integrins are also causally linked to pathological conditions such as tumor progression, thrombosis, inflammation, and osteoporosis (6Ruoslahti E. Giancotti F.G. Cancer Cells. 1989; 1: 119-126PubMed Google Scholar, 7Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 8Engleman V.W. Nickols G.A. Ross P.F. Horton M.A. Griggs D.W. Settle S.L. Ruminski P.G. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2284-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The integrin protein family contains 13 α and 9 β subunits. These subunits can cross-pair to form heterodimers with different expression patterns and distinct ligand binding profiles (9Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar, 10Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9022) Google Scholar). Each integrin binds to only a limited series of ligands, ensuring that cell adhesion and migration are precisely regulated. Such precision is key to tissue remodeling. Based on their ligand recognition specificity, integrins can be divided into two broad sub-families. About one-half of the integrins bind to ligands that lack any consensus binding motif. The remaining integrins bind to the RGD 1The abbreviations used are: RGD, arginine-glycine-aspartate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PD, pixel density. consensus sequence. Importantly though, even the integrins that bind to RGD display a great deal of specificity for matrix ligands (11Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar, 12Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. Mecham R.P. Integrins. Academic Press, New York1994: 1-32Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Some of this specificity is determined by contacts that are ancillary to the RGD sequence (13Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Obara M. Kang M.S. Yamada K.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), but much of the specificity is determined by the shape of the RGD motif and the residues in its immediate vicinity. Thus, to understand the structural basis of matrix selection, it is important to understand how integrins distinguish the many conformations of RGD. The goal of the present study was to identify domain(s) within the integrin β subunit that confer ligand binding specificity. As a model system, we compared the ligand binding domains of the two most homologous integrins, αvβ3 and αvβ5. The β3 and β5 subunits have 56% identity at the amino acid level (15Ramaswamy H. Hemler M.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1561-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16McLean J.W. Vestal D.J. Cheresh D.A. Bodary S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17126-17131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although both αvβ3 and αvβ5 recognize the RGD motif, the αvβ3 integrin binds to at least six more ligands than αvβ5, indicating that αvβ3 has a more relaxed ligand binding specificity (17Smith J.W. Vestal D.J. Irwin S.V. Burke T.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11008-11013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference in the way the two integrins bind to ligand may ultimately be related to their distinct biological functions. For example, while both αvβ3 and αvβ5 can mediate cell adhesion, only αvβ3 mediates cell spreading and migration in the absence of an external stimulus (18Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 19Filardo E.J. Deming S.L. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1615-1622PubMed Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we constructed a series of chimeras between β3 and β5 and assessed the ability of the chimeric integrins to bind to two ligands that exhibit significant binding preference for αvβ3 over αvβ5. One ligand, Fab-9, is an engineered Fab that contains an RGD sequence within the heavy chain complementarity determining region 3. Fab-9 was selected from a phage display library for the ability to bind the β3-integrins with high affinity (20Barbas C.F. Languino L. Smith J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10003-10007Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In fact, this ligand exhibits greater than 1000-fold higher affinity for αvβ3 than for αvβ5 (20Barbas C.F. Languino L. Smith J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10003-10007Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Another ligand, fibrinogen, is a protein involved in blood clotting and is thought to be a physiologic ligand for αvβ3 on endothelial cells (21Liaw L. Lindner V. Schwartz S.M. Chambers A.F. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 22Kramer R.H. Cheng Y.-F. Clyman R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Prior study has shown that it fails to bind to αvβ5 (17Smith J.W. Vestal D.J. Irwin S.V. Burke T.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11008-11013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike Fab-9, fibrinogen contains multiple integrin-binding sites: two RGD motifs and an additional adhesive domain in the carboxyl terminus of its γ chain (23Cheresh D.A. Berliner S.A. Vicente V. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 945-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 24Smith J.W. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12267-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the β3/β5 chimeras shows that exons C and D of the β3 subunit are key to determining the binding specificity for Fab-9 and fibrinogen. However, within this larger domain, a small region of only 39 amino acid residues has a significant impact on ligand selection. An alignment of this small domain in all integrin β subunits shows it to be highly divergent. Structural algorithms also predict the region to be conformationally flexible. This is the first identification of a domain within the integrin β subunit involved in ligand selection. In conjunction with our prior studies that map a region of the α subunit that determines ligand binding specificity (25Loftus J.C. Halloran C.E. Ginsberg M.H. Feigen L.P. Zablocki J.A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2033-2039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), these results provide a structural basis for matrix selection by integrins. Monoclonal antibody L230 (anti-αv) was purified from the culture supernatant of the hybridoma obtained from ATCC. The anti-αvβ3 mAb LM609 was purchased from Chemicon. The mAb P112-4C1 that is specific for the αvβ3 complex was generated by conventional procedures at Searle/Monsanto. This antibody is specific for the complex between αv and β3 and blocks the integrin's ligand binding function. 2E. C. K. Lin, unpublished data. The mAb RUU-PL7F12, which recognizes the β3 subunit, and mAb P1F6 (anti-αvβ5) were purchased from Becton Dickinson. The mAb P3G2 (against αvβ5) was provided by Dr. David Cheresh (Scripps Research Institute). The polyclonal antibody directed against the β5 cytoplasmic tail was a kind gift from Dr. Lou Reichardt. Fab-9 is specific for the αvβ3 integrin ligand binding site. The characterization of this antibody has been previously described (20Barbas C.F. Languino L. Smith J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10003-10007Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,26Smith J.W. Hu D. Satterthwait A. Pinz-Sweeny S. Barbas III, C.F. J. Biol.

Synthetic peptides with sequences GRGDSP and SPGDRG were synthesized by Coast Scientific. Wild-type β3 and β5 cDNA were cloned using PCR and verified by sequencing. Chimeras between β3 and β5 were designed based on the genomic sequence of β3, of which the exon junctions (labeled A–N) have been delineated (27Lanza F. Kieffer N. Phillips D.R. Fitzgerald L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18098-18103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As β5 is highly homologous to β3 in amino acid sequence, we designed the chimeras based on their sequence homology and placed the junctions of each chimera at or near the exon boundaries. Chimeras were constructed by PCR using β3/β5 hybrid primers and primers that encompassed an endogenous restriction site. The resultant hybrid cDNA, consisting of β3 and β5 sequence flanked by restriction sites, was then cloned into the cDNA for β5 at endogenous restriction sites to complete the full-length integrin subunit. β3/β5 hybrid primers (listed 5′ to 3′) used to construct the junctions (/) of the chimeric integrin β subunits were as follows: β3-(A–B)/β5,GGTCTTGTCACC/TGGCCGGAGCCGGAGTGCAATCCT and CGGCTCCGGCCA/GGTGACAAGACCACCTTC; β3-(A–D)/β5, ACAGTCTGTGAT/GAGAAGATTGGCTGGCGAAAGGAT andGCCAATCTTCTC/ATCACAGACTGTAGCCTGCATGAT; β3-(C–D)/β5, CTTCGAATCATC/GGGCCGGAGGTTCACGGCAATCTC; β3-(A–J)/β5, ACCTTTAAGAAA/GATTGCGTCGAGTGCCCGCTGCTC andCTCGACGCAATC/TTTCTTAAAGGTGCAGGCATCTGG; β3-(A–L)/β5, AAGTCCATCCTG/SCCGTCCTCAGGGAGCCAGAGTGT andCCTGAGGACGGT/CAGGATGGACTTTCCACTAGAATC. To facilitate the cloning of the chimera containing β3 residues 164–202, a silentEcoRV restriction site was introduced into β5 by mutagenesis. The point mutation at residue 587 (underlined) was made using the primer GTTGATAAGGATATCTCTCCTTTCTCC and the Chameleon Double-Stranded, Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Hybrid primers were then used to generate the β3/β5 junctions by PCR as follows: GATATCTCT/CCATACATGTATATCTCC and GGTGACCCGCTTC/AATGAGGAAGTTCGGAAACAGAGG. The chimera β3-(C–D)/β5 was made by subcloning the amino-terminal β5 end into the cDNA encoding β3-(A–D)/β5. The chimera β3-(A–I)/β5 was made by replacing the amino-terminal fragment of β5 with β3 at the endogenous NcoI restriction site that is located at the end of exon I in both β3 and β5. The nucleotide sequence of each chimera was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells obtained from ATCC were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Irvine Scientific). The 293 cells contain αv and express no detectable αvβ3. The 293 cells express trace levels of αvβ5 (28Lin E.C.K. Ratnikov B.I. Tsai P.M. Gonzalez E.R. Pelletier A.J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14236-142243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Chimeric cDNAs consisting of human β3 and β5 cDNA were cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and transfected into 293 cells usingN[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate transfection reagent (Boehringer Mannheim). Following selection in 500 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 3 weeks, the cells were selected by FACS to obtain the top 5% of the expressing cells. These were chosen by sorting with antibodies against αvβ3 (P112-4C1) or anti-αvβ5 (P1F6). Cells expanded from the sorted population were continuously monitored by FACS analysis for high expression of transfected integrin throughout the duration of the study. Ligand binding to human 293 cells expressing αvβ3, αvβ5, or chimeras between β3 and β5 was measured with 125I-vitronectin using a tracer format as described previously (28Lin E.C.K. Ratnikov B.I. Tsai P.M. Gonzalez E.R. Pelletier A.J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14236-142243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, vitronectin was labeled to high specific activity (150,000 cpm/ng) with 125INa and allowed to bind to cells held in suspension. Incubations were carried out in Binding Buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution lacking MgCl2, CaCl2, and MnCl2 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.02 mm CaCl2 at 14 °C for 70 min. A range of unlabeled vitronectin was included with the cells to compete for binding to 0.5 nm125I-vitronectin. Specific binding was determined by subtracting EDTA-sensitive binding from total binding. Scatchard analysis was used to calculate the affinity of chimeric integrin for vitronectin (29Rechler M.M. Podskalny J.M. Nissley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3898-3910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of the chimeric integrins for Fab-9 was measured using cell surface binding studies essentially as described (28Lin E.C.K. Ratnikov B.I. Tsai P.M. Gonzalez E.R. Pelletier A.J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14236-142243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (3 × 106/ml) in suspension were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-Fab-9 at 14 °C for 70 min. Nonspecific binding was measured by including 5 mmEDTA in the reaction mixture. Previous studies in this laboratory have shown that competition with an excess of unlabeled Fab-9 yields nearly identical values for nonspecific binding as does inclusion of EDTA. Following incubation, free 125I-Fab-9 was separated from cell-bound ligand by centrifugation through 20% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 14,000 rpm for 3 min in disposable microcentrifuge tubes (Fisher). The bottoms of the tubes containing the cell pellets were cut off and counted in a gamma counter. All data represent the average of triplicate measurements. All assays were repeated at least twice yielding nearly identical results. The affinity of the chimeric integrin for Fab-9 was calculated by Scatchard analysis (30Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17809) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations used to assess the expression of chimeras on the surface of kidney 293 cells were performed as described previously except that 75 mmoctylglucoside was used as the sole detergent (31Cheresh D.A. Spiro R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17703-17711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A modified protocol was used to measure the binding of Fab-9 to the chimeras. Cells expressing chimeric integrin were labeled with 125I using the lactoperoxidase method (32Hudson L. Hay F.C. Practical Immunology. Blackwell Scientific Publications, London1980: 243-244Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer (75 mm octylglucoside (Calbiochem), 25 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.05 mmMnCl2). Cell lysates were precleared with Pansorbin (Calbiochem) and then lipid was removed using Seroclear (Calbiochem). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with P112-4C1 (anti-αvβ3 mAb) for 18 h at 4 °C. Chimeric integrins were eluted from the P112-4C1-linked Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad) with Elution Buffer (50 mm octylglucoside, 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.0). The eluted integrins were immediately neutralized by addition of 3 m Tris, pH 8.8. This material was dialyzed extensively against 50 mm octylglucoside, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.05 mm MnCl2. The partially purified integrins were then immunoprecipitated with a concentration range of Fab-9 in Lysis Buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The complex between integrin and Fab-9 was precipitated by addition of protein A-agarose (Sigma) and a saturating amount of goat anti-human F(ab′)2 IgG. The protein bound to protein A-agarose was washed in Lysis Buffer and then with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.05 mmMnCl2. Samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. Chimeric integrins precipitated by Fab-9 were visualized by exposing the dried gel to a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). Each chimeric β band was quantified as pixel density (PD) volume which was calculated as the mean PD multiplied by the area (mm2) of the band. The apparent affinity of Fab-9 for the chimeric integrin was calculated as the concentration of Fab-9 that gave 50% of the maximal PD units at a saturating concentration of Fab-9. Quantitative immunoprecipitations were always done in parallel with cells expressing αvβ3. The cell adhesion assay was conducted essentially as described (33Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested with 200 μm EDTA/phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma) supplemented with 25 μm MnCl2. 2 × 105 cells were added to each well containing immobilized fibrinogen (20 nm) or vitronectin (10 nm). Cells were allowed to adhere for 45 min at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed by gentle washing, and the adherent cells were quantitated using a colorimetric assay for lysosomal acid phosphatase (34Pratner C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To identify domains of the integrin β subunit involved in ligand binding specificity, we constructed chimeras between the β3 and β5 subunits. As some models suggest that domains of the β subunit near the plasma membrane are linked to amino-terminal domains and contribute to ligand binding (35Calvete J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 208: 346-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 36Calvete J.J. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we constructed several chimeras that contained relatively broad regions of β3 (Fig.1). Most chimeras were constructed based on the known exon junctions for β3 (27Lanza F. Kieffer N. Phillips D.R. Fitzgerald L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18098-18103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, β3-(A–L)/β5 is a chimera containing β3 exons A through L (the entire extracellular domain) and the β5 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The chimera β3-(C–D)/β5 encompasses most of the regions of β3 thought to be part of the ligand binding site. The cDNAs encoding each chimera were used to transfect human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The stable expression of each chimera was monitored by FACS. For this analysis, we used monoclonal antibodies (mAb) P112-4C1 (anti-αvβ3) and P1F6 (anti-αvβ5). These antibodies are specific for the complex between αv and the respective β subunit. Both antibodies also block the ligand binding function of integrin; hence, their ability to bind to the chimeras can be taken as evidence that the domain swaps do not grossly alter the fold of the hybrid integrins. Human 293 cells transfected with the control expression vector produced little endogenous αvβ3 or αvβ5 (Fig.2 A). Cells transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type β3 (Fig. 2 B) and wild-type β5 (Fig. 2 E) expressed substantial levels of each integrin. The chimera containing β3 exons A through I was detected with antibody P112-4C1 (Fig. 2 C). The chimera containing β3 exons A and B was detected with mAb P1F6 (Fig. 2 D). Results from FACS analysis of the remaining chimeras are summarized in Table I. Additional antibodies LM609 (anti-αvβ3) and P3G2 (anti-αvβ5) reported identical expression levels as P112-4C1 and P1F6, respectively (Table I). The anti-β3 mAb RUU-PL7F12 did not bind to chimeras containing small regions of β3 within exons A–D. Three other chimeras that were constructed, β3-(A–E)/β5, β3-(C–E)/β5, and β3-(A–H)/β5, were not expressed as a heterodimer with αv on the cell surface, even though reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that mRNA for these β subunits was produced by transfected cells.Table IExpression of transfected integrin β subunits as measured by FACS analysisTransfected integrinFACS Reactivity with Monoclonal Antibodies1-aFACS reactivity is quantitated by subtracting the mean fluorescence intensity of the nonspecific mouse IgG control from the mean fluorescence intensity of the anti-integrin mAb: −, 1–5 (not different than nonspecific mouse IgG); +/−, 5–10; +, 11–30; ++, 31–50; +++, greater than 50.P1F61-bMonoclonal antibody P3G2 (anti-αvβ5) gave results identical to mAb P1F6 (not shown).

Open table in a new tab Chimeras were analyzed by immunoprecipitation to confirm their association with αv and to quickly assess their ability to bind to Fab-9, a ligand specific for the β3-integrins. Cells were radiolabeled with 125I and then precipitated with four different antibodies (Fig.3). These include a control IgG (lane 1), an antibody against the cytoplasmic tail of β5 (lane 2), mAb L230 against αv (lane 3), and Fab-9 (lane 4). Human 293 cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector express little αv in complex with β subunit (A, lane 3). Cells transfected with cDNA encoding β3 (B), β5 (E), or a chimeric β subunit (C and D) expressed substantial levels of an integrin complex on the cell surface. It is important to note that although all of the chimeras contained variable regions of β3 ectodomain, they all contained the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of β5. Thus, the expression of the β3/β5 chimeras can be verified by precipitating with an antibody against the cytoplasmic tail of β5 (lane 2, C and D). Under the conditions used to lyse the cells, the complex between the α and β subunit is not disrupted, so this assay also allowed us to quickly screen the chimeras for the ability to bind to Fab-9.Lane 4 of each panel in Fig. 3 shows an immunoprecipitation using Fab-9 at a concentration of 190 nm. This level of Fab-9 is known to be 19-fold above the K D of Fab-9 for wild-type αvβ3 (see Table I). As expected, Fab-9 precipitated αvβ3 (B) but not αvβ5 (E). One chimera, β3-(A–B)/β5 (C) failed to bind Fab-9, indicating that exons A and B of β3 are not sufficient to confer ligand binding specificity. In contrast, the chimeras containing β3 exons A–L, A–J, A–I, A–D (D), C–D, and β3 residues 164–202 were all precipitated by Fab-9, indicating that each has β3-like binding specificity (not all data shown). The affinity of these chimeras for Fab-9 was subsequently studied in detail (see below). One chimera, β3-(A-B)/β5, was recognized by the function-blocking antibodies P1F6 (Fig. 2, Table I) and P3G2 (not shown), both of which are specific for the complex between αv and β5. β3-(A–B)/β5 was also found to lack the ability to bind Fab-9 (Fig. 3), indicating that it does not have the ligand binding specificity of αvβ3. To confirm that β3-(A–B)/β5 had ligand binding function, we measured its ability to bind soluble vitronectin. We have previously shown that soluble vitronectin has high affinity for αvβ5 but much less affinity for αvβ3 (28Lin E.C.K. Ratnikov B.I. Tsai P.M. Gonzalez E.R. Pelletier A.J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14236-142243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The β3-(A–B)/β5 chimera bound to 125I-vitronectin with an affinity only 3.2-fold lower than that of wild-type αvβ5 (29 versus 9 nm, respectively) (Fig. 4). The binding was almost completely abolished with antibody L230, which blocks ligand binding to all αv-integrins (37Weinacker A. Chen A. Agrez M. Cone R.I. Nishimura S. Wayner E. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6940-6948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and by RGD peptide (not shown). Because the β3-(A–B)/β5 chimera was capable of binding to vitronectin, but incapable of binding to Fab-9, we conclude that exons A and B of the integrin β subunit do not substantially contribute to ligand binding specificity. This conclusion is also supported by the inability of cells expressing this chimera to adhere to fibrinogen (see below). All of the chimeras except β3-(A–B)/β5 indicated some ability to bind to Fab-9 using the immunoprecipitation assay at a saturating Fab-9 concentration (Fig. 3). As a next step, we used a cell surface binding assay to measure the binding affinity of these chimeras for Fab-9. The binding of 125I-Fab-9 to cells expressing the chimeras was measured at 14 °C to prevent the internalization of ligand. The binding isotherms between 125I-Fab-9 and cells expressing αvβ3 or β3-(A-I)/β5 are shown in Fig.5 as an example. The chimera containing exons A–I of β3 has an affinity for Fab-9 that is equivalent to that of wild-type αvβ3. Chimeras containing larger domains of β3 (exons A–J and A–L) also bound to Fab-9 with an affinity identical to wild type αvβ3 (Table II). Based on these observations, it can be concluded that a swap of exons A–I in the β3 subunit is sufficient to change the integrin's ligand recognition specificity. As previously reported, Fab-9 failed to specifically bind to cells expressing wild-type αvβ5 (28Lin E.C.K. Ratnikov B.I. Tsai P.M. Gonzalez E.R. Pelletier A.J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14236-142243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and also failed to bind the β3-(A–B)/β5 chimera in this quantitative assay (data not shown). In conjunction with the data shown in Figs. 3 and 4, which indicate that exons A and B are not involved in ligand selection, these findings suggest that the domain encompassing β3 exons C–I is important for determining complete ligand binding specificity.Table IIBinding affinities of chimeric integrins for Fab-9Transfected integrinAffinity for Fab-9Whole cell bindingImmunoprecipitationnm ± S.D.

https://openalex.org/W1969313769,"A newly identified nuclear protein rich in leucine heptad repeats called HEC is important for mitosis. To elucidate its mechanism of action, the region containing leucine heptad repeats was used to identify cellular proteins that potentially interact with HEC. Complementary DNAs encoding several proteins including MSS1, p45, Nek2, and Smc1/Smc2, known to be important for G2/M progression, were identified. The interaction between HEC and MSS1, the seventh regulatory subunit of the 26 S proteasome, was further demonstrated by in vitro GST pull-down assays. HEC is not a part of the 26 S proteasome and interacts with MSS1 only when it is dissociated from the complex during M phase. Purified MSS1 specifically hydrolyzes ATP, an activity inhibited by HEC. In addition, HEC inhibits the proteolysis of mitotic cyclin B in vitro. Consistent with this biochemical activity, ectopic expression of HEC inhibits the degradation of mitotic cyclins after telophase, resulting eventually in cell death. These results show that HEC is a negative regulator of MSS1 and suggest that it may modulate M phase progression, in part, through the regulation of proteasome-mediated degradation of cell cycle regulatory proteins.

The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway is important for a wide range of cellular functions including cell cycle control, DNA repair, peroxisome biogenesis, and resistance to heavy metals. In addition to recognizing and eliminating unassembled proteins and disposing of damaged or misfolded proteins, it is also responsible for the degradation of short-lived proteins, a process that is complex and highly regulated (reviewed in Refs. 1Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar, 2Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The first step in this process is the ligation of the C terminus of ubiquitin to ε-amino groups of lysine residues within the substrate. After ubiquitination, the substrates are targeted to the 26 S proteasome complex, which contains over 20 distinct subunit activities, including multiple peptidases, ATPases, and a deubiquitinating enzyme. The 26 S proteasome is composed of two functionally distinct protein components, a catalytic 20 S proteasome and a regulatory complex. Controlled proteolysis requires that a regulatory complex be attached to each end of the 20 S proteasome. The regulatory complex is composed of 15 different subunits named according to their size as measured by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, with S1 being the largest and S15 the smallest. The proteolysis of certain substrates is ATP-dependent and requires polyubiquitination of the substrate. Assembly of the 26 S proteasome is ATP-dependent, and the regulatory subunits have been found to belong to an ATPase subfamily that includes TBP-1, MSS1, p45, subunit 4 (mts2), CIM5, CIM3, andSUG1 (4Nelbock P.

Temperature-sensitive mutants of CIM5, the homologue of human MSS1 in S. cerevisiae, progress through the cell cycle normally at permissive temperatures. At restrictive temperatures, they arrest at the G2/M boundary coincident with the loss of 26 S proteasome activity (8Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). These observations linked 26 S proteasome activity directly to cell cycle control, specifically during the mitotic phase. In metazoan cells, cyclin degradation by regulated proteolysis is crucial for M phase progression (reviewed in Refs. 1Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar and 12King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). In this stage of the cell cycle, a large protein complex called the anaphase-promoting complex (APC; 1The abbreviations used are: APC, anaphase-promoting complex; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescence protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino2-phenylindole.

Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) starts chromosome segregation and exit from mitosis through targeting anaphase inhibitors and mitotic cyclins for degradation by way of the 26 S proteasome. Although interdependent, this pathway is distinct from the proteolytic CDC34 pathway that participates in the regulated proteolysis of the G1 cyclins (12King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Recognition of the APC substrates for ubiquitination is by way of a 9-amino acid motif referred to as the destruction (D) box. A key event in anaphase progression in yeast is the APC-mediated proteolysis of a non-cyclin substrate (CUT2, fission yeast; PSD1, budding yeast) that is an inhibitor of anaphase initiation (14Cohen-Fix O. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Koshland D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 15Funabiki H. Yamano H. Kumada K. Nagao K. Hunt T. Yanagida M. Nature. 1996; 381: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Although much is known concerning the identity of the players in APC-mediated ubiquitination, little is understood regarding their regulation or the control of 26 S proteasomes. Nevertheless, it is clear that regulation of proteolysis in M phase is key to its orderly progression. The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) has an important role in regulating the cell cycle as well as differentiation, development, and the suppression of malignant transformation (16Riley D.J. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The isolation of cellular proteins that interact with Rb has provided important information regarding the molecular basis of its function (17Shan B. Zhu X. Chen P.-L. Durfee T. Yang Y. Sharp D. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5620-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 18Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J.

One of these interacting proteins (18Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar), originally identified as a partial cDNA, C15, was later named HEC because of its high expression in cancers. During its characterization, HEC was found to be a centromere-associated protein with a critical role in chromosome segregation. When HEC is deregulated in cells by microinjection with specific antibodies, abnormal daughter cells are produced that fail to proceed to the next division and subsequently die (20Chen, Y., Riley, D. J., Chen, P.-L., Lee, W.-H., (1997) Mol. Cell. Biol. , 17, in press.Google Scholar). To elucidate the potential role of HEC in M phase progression, the cellular proteins interacting with HEC through its long stretch of leucine heptad repeats were identified using yeast two-hybrid screening. Interestingly, one of these proteins had been previously identified as MSS1, the seventh regulatory subunit of the 26 S proteasome. The ATPase activity of MSS1 is down-regulated by HEC, and degradation of cyclin B by proteasomes is prevented by the addition of HEC in an in vitro assay. Furthermore, ectopic expression of a HEC mutant inhibits mitotic cyclin degradation during mitosisin vivo. These results suggests that the interaction between HEC and MSS1 is biologically significant. The HEC protein has two major domains: an amino-terminal portion containing a region that interacts with the Rb protein and a carboxyl-terminal region that is enriched with heptad leucine repeats (20Chen, Y., Riley, D. J., Chen, P.-L., Lee, W.-H., (1997) Mol. Cell. Biol. , 17, in press.Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of the HEC cDNA encoding the leucine repeat-rich region (amino acids 251–618) was ligated into the modified yeast vector, pAS1, and used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human lymphocyte cDNA library using previously published procedures (17Shan B. Zhu X. Chen P.-L. Durfee T. Yang Y. Sharp D. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5620-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar,18Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). The full-length MSS1 cDNA was subcloned into theBamHI site of pGEX-3X (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for expression of GST-MSS1 fusion protein. The MSS1C construct was obtained by subcloning the 0.8-kilobase pairBamHI-XhoI fragment into a modified pGEX-3X vector. Expression of this construct in bacteria generates a GST-MSS1C fusion protein. HEC-GST fusion constructs were obtained by subcloning a 2.3-kilobase pair full-length cDNA fragment from pBKS-C15 (GST-HEC) and a 1.5-kilobase pair fragment BamHI-BglII (GST-15Pst, amino acids 251–618) into pGEX-3X. Recombinant GST-MSS1, GST-MSS1C, GST-HEC, and GST-15Pst fusion polypetides were expressed in Escherichia coli. Six hours after induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm) at room temperature, cells from 1 liter of culture were lysed with 10 ml of lysis-250 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The soluble fraction was loaded onto a 0.5-ml glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm glutathione (Sigma). The eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to determine their concentration and purity. Partially purified GST-MSS1 fusion protein (95% purity) was used as antigen to immunize mice. After three boosts with 100 μg of fusion protein, specific antiserum against MSS1 was obtained. The enzymatic hydrolysis of ATP was done as described previously (21Lucero H.A. Chojnicki E.W.T. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9178-9184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified proteins were incubated for 30 min. at 30 °C in the presence of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) in a 20-μl reaction volume consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mmATP. Reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 50 mm. 2 μl of the reactions were spotted onto polyethyleneimine TLC plates (Sigma) and developed in 0.5 mLiCl, 1 m formic acid (22Roy R. Schaeffer L. Humbert S. Vermeulen W. Weeda G. Egly J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9826-9832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of released inorganic phosphate was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. For the antibody blocking experiment, beads containing GST-MSS1 fusion protein were first incubated with anti-MSS1 antibody or anti-GST antibody for 30 min and then washed with 20 ml of 1 × PBS. The blocked beads were then used for the ATPase assay. In the competition experiments, unlabeled nucleoside triphosphates in the indicated concentrations (μm) were added to the basic ATPase assay. Human 26 S proteasome preparation was kindly provided by M. Rechsteiner (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). After separation on SDS-PAGE, the proteins were immunoblotted and developed with anti-MSS1 and anti-HEC antibodies as described previously (19Chen P.L. Ueng Y.C. Durfee T. Chen K.C. Yang-Feng T. Lee W.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar). HEC was translated in vitro using cDNAs and a TNT reticulocyte transcription translation-coupled system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the supplier's instructions. GST pull-down assays were done as described previously (19Chen P.L. Ueng Y.C. Durfee T. Chen K.C. Yang-Feng T. Lee W.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar). Human bladder carcinoma cells, T24 (ATCC, Rockville, MD), grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, were synchronized at G1 by density arrest in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5% serum and then released at time 0 by replating in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum at a density of 2 × 106cells/10-cm plate. At various time points thereafter (18 h for G1/S, 22 h for S, 33 h for G2), cells were harvested. To obtain cells in M phase, nocodazole (0.4 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium for 8 h prior to harvest as described previously (23Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar). Cells lysed in Lysis 250 buffer were subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles (liquid nitrogen/37 °C), and clarified by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 2 min at room temperature). The supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation as described (24Chen P.L. Riley D.J. Chen-Kiang S. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μl of mouse polyclonal anti-C15 antisera or 1 μg of anti-Myc 9E10 (25Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar), were added to each clarified supernatant. After a 1-h incubation, protein A-Sepharose beads were added for another hour. The beads were then collected and washed five times with lysis buffer containing 250 mm NaCl and then boiled in SDS-loading buffer for immunoblotting analysis as described (23Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-green fluorescence protein (anti-GFP) (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used at a 1:250 dilution for immunoblotting analysis. The procedures to fractionate cell components were adapted from those previously published (26Lee W.H. Xu Y. Hong F. Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Ueng Y.C. Chen P.L. Riley D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cell lysates prepared from differently synchronized populations of T24 cells were loaded on 5–25% preformed sucrose gradients and centrifuged in an SW41 rotor (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) at 28,000 rpm for 15 h at 4 °C. Aliquots of each fraction were then assayed for the presence of MSS1 and HEC by Western blotting analysis as described above. Three constructs were used in transfection assays: 1) CHPL-GFP, a modified plasmid derived from a mammalian expression vector containing a Myc-tagged, mutant form of green fluorescence protein (S65T; Ref. 27Heim R. Prasher D.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12501-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar) (CLONTECH); 2) CHPL-GFP-15PA, containing GFP fused to the N terminus of HEC (amino acids 1–250); and 3) CHPL-GFP-15Pst, containing GFP fused to the C-terminal portion of HEC (amino acids 251–618). Transfection of 1 × 106 cells was done using a conventional calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation method (17Shan B. Zhu X. Chen P.-L. Durfee T. Yang Y. Sharp D. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5620-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The precipitates were removed 12 h after transfection, and the cultures were refed with fresh medium. The cells were then observed under a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot Photomicroscope, Zeiss). Cells grown on coverslips in tissue culture dishes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 30 min in 4% formaldehyde in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100. After treatment with 0.05% saponin in water for 30 min and extensive washing with PBS, cells were blocked in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum. An overnight incubation with antibody diluted in 10% goat serum at 4 °C was followed by three washes and then by a 1-h incubation with Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody. Anti-cyclin A and B antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used at dilutions of 2 μg/ml. The respective antigens were visualized with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Texas Red (Amersham Corp.). After washing extensively in PBS with 0.5% Nonidet-P 40, cells were further stained with DAPI (Sigma) and mounted in Permafluor (Lipshaw-Immunonon, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). Ektachrome P1600 film was used when pictures were taken from a standard fluorescence microscope (Axiophot Photomicroscope, Zeiss). In vitrotranslated, [35S]methionine-labeled cyclin B was incubated at 30 °C in 240 μl of degradation mix (final concentration, 33% (v/v) rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 0.1 μmGST, GST-HEC, or GST-15Pst. At different times thereafter, aliquots (30 μl) of the reaction mix were withdrawn for SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To explore the potential biochemical basis for the biological function of HEC, we sought to obtain clues by searching for proteins with which it interacts. Since leucine heptad repeats are known to be important in protein-protein interactions (28Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), the C-terminal two-thirds of HEC containing the long stretches of these repeats was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human lymphocyte cDNA library. Among the 16 strongly interacting clones obtained, 12 were identified as cDNA fragments encoding MSS1, a component of subunit 7 of the 26 S proteasome complex (5Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Goebl M. Taniguchi T. Matsumoto K.

Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar) is well established. To further assess the biological significance of the association between HEC and its interacting proteins, we chose to focus first on MSS1. To further confirm the yeast two-hybrid results, an in vitrobinding experiment was performed using a GST pull-down assay. HEC was synthesized by a reticulocyte lysate transcription-translation system and tested for its ability to bind GST-MSS1 and GST-MSS1C (amino acids 328–434) fusion proteins. The results showed that the C-terminal portion of MSS1 is sufficient for binding to HEC (Fig.1 A). To determine the region(s) of HEC necessary for an interaction with MSS1, three HEC deletion constructs, each containing a variable number of the leucine heptad repeats, were fused in frame to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. These constructs were then used in the yeast two-hybrid system to assay for their ability to interact with MSS1. As shown in (Fig.1 B), the second region of leucine heptad repeats located between amino acids 361 and 547 of HEC is sufficient for interactions with MSS1. MSS1 is the seventh regulatory subunit of the 26 S proteasome complex (5Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since it binds to MSS1 in vitro, HEC could also be a constituent of the regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome. To test this possibility, we obtained three active fractions of partially purified 26 S proteasomes (kindly provided by M. Rechsteiner; see Fig.2, lanes 2–4) and assayed for the presence of MSS1 and HEC. Consistent with previous sequencing data from subunit 7 peptides isolated from 26 S proteasomes (5Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), MSS1 was detected in all three fractions containing 26 S proteasome activity (Fig. 2, lanes 6–8), while HEC was not detected in any of the fractions (Fig. 2, lanes 10–12). However, MSS1 and HEC are both detected in total cellular protein lysate (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 9). This result suggests that HEC is not present in the 26 S proteasome complex. Since HEC is not a component of the 26 S proteasome but does interact with the MSS1, a regulatory subunit of the proteasome, it is important to determine the temporal and spatial status of these two proteins in cells. To answer these questions, specific antibodies were used to examine expression during cell cycle progression. HEC is expressed most abundantly during late S to M phase (Fig.3 B, top panel), while MSS1 is expressed throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 3 A,middle panel). Co-immunoprecipitation of HEC and MSS1 was detected only during M phase (Fig. 3 B, middle panel). To further assess the potential of a HEC/MSS1 interaction, a sedimentation analysis of cellular lysates was performed. In cell lysates prepared from cells synchronized in S phase, the majority of MSS1 was found to be in fractions consistent with its association with the 26 S proteasome complex (Fig.4 A). This fraction is distinct from that containing HEC, which, during this phase, sediments at a lower S value (Fig. 4 A). In M phase-synchronized cells, a significant portion of MSS1 co-sediments with HEC in the lower S value fractions (Fig. 4 B). These data are consistent with the results in Fig. 3 B, which showed that HEC/MSS1 co-immunoprecipitated only during M phase.Figure 4Sedimentation analysis of HEC and MSS1.The synchronization of T24 bladder carcinoma cells, preparation of cellular lysates, sucrose centrifugation, and straight Western analysis of the fractions were described under “Experimental Procedures.” The top and bottom of the gradients are indicated along with the positions of molecular mass standards within the gradients. Fraction numbers are shown at the bottom. A, analysis of cells synchronized in S phase. Note the position of MSS1 in fractions that are consistent with its association of proteasomes.

Note the overlap of MSS1 and HEC immunoreactivity in the lower molecular mass fractions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A potential function of the HEC/MSS1 interaction is to regulate proteasome activity by modulation of MSS1. MSS1, as well as several other cloned regulatory subunits of the 26 S proteasome (S4, TBP1, SUG1, CIM5, CIM3, and p45), contain ATPase domains (4Nelbock P. Dillon P.J. Perkins A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1990; 248: 1650-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Presumably, the putative ATPase activity common to all of these regulatory subunits is an important aspect of their function. Alterations in this activity could be important for regulation of proteasome function. Although MSS1 is presumed to be an ATPase, this activity, to our knowledge, has never been tested. Therefore, to determine if HEC can modulate its ATPase activity, it was first necessary to assay MSS1 and HEC for their ability to hydrolyze ATP. To test for ATPase activity, bacterially expressed MSS1 and HEC fusion proteins were prepared. For MSS1, a full-length cDNA was subcloned into a modified version of the pGEX-2T vector and expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST-MSS1). The presence of a single 72-kDa band in an SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig.5 A, lane 1) demonstrates the purity of the fusion protein after glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. To obtain HEC-GST fusion proteins, full-length (GST-HEC) and truncated (GST-15Pst, amino acids 251–618) cDNAs were translationally fused to GST in pGEX-2T, expressed, and purified (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and3, respectively). For controls in subsequent experiments, GST was also expressed and purified (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5 B, GST-MSS1, but not GST-HEC, GST-15Pst, or GST, can hydrolyze ATP. Furthermore, the ATPase activity of GST-MSS1 is inhibited by incubating the purified protein with anti-MSS1 antibody but is not affected by anti-GST antibodies (Fig. 5 C). To verify the nucleoside specificity of MSS1's ATPase activity, unlabeled nucleoside triphosphates at the indicated concentrations were added to the ATPase reaction (Fig. 5 D). Significant inhibition of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis by unlabeled ATP in a concentration-dependent manner, but not by GTP, CTP, or UTP (Fig. 5 D), indicates that MSS1 predominantly hydrolyzes ATP. Since MSS1, but not HEC, has ATPase activity, we next examined if HEC regulates this activity through its association with MSS1. The effect of HEC was examined by including varying amounts of GST, GST-HEC, or GST-15Pst in the ATPase reactions. As shown in Fig.6, GST alone has very little effect on MSS1's ATPase activity, while GST-HEC and GST-15Pst showed dose-dependent inhibition of MSS1's ATPase activity. Since GST-15Pst contains the leucine heptad repeat domain with which MSS1 interacts (amino acids 251–618), the data suggest that this region of HEC is sufficient to inhibit the ATPase activity of MSS1. Since HEC association with MSS1 is only detectable during M phase of the cell cycle and because it can negatively regulate the ATPase activity of MSS1, we next investigated the possibility that HEC can regulate the degradation of mitotic cyclins. As shown in Fig.7, cyclin B synthesized by rabbit reticulocyte lysates can be degraded in vitro using a proteasome degradation assay. The addition of GST had no influence on cyclin B degradation, while the addition of GST-HEC or GST-15Pst significantly inhibited cyclin B degradation. These results suggest that HEC may down-regulate proteasome activity. We next wished to address the possibility that HEC may regulate the degradation of mitotic cyclins in cells. This was hampered by the deleterious effects of HEC overexpression in cells. An alternative approach to circumvent this problem was to express a truncated form of HEC lacking an NLS. It was postulated that, under conditions of cytoplasmic accumulation of HEC, it should be possible to observe the effects after nuclear envelope breakdown. Since the heptad repeats in HEC that bind to MSS1 were sufficient for inhibition of MSS1 activity in vitro, we sought to determine whether expression of this region of HEC alone, which lacks the NLS, could influence cell division and/or mitotic cyclin degradation. Two constructs using two separate regions of HEC fused to GFP were used; GFP-15PA contains the N-terminal region only (amino acids 1–250), and GFP-15Pst contains the entire series of leucine heptad repeats (amino acids 251–618) (Fig.8 A). The GFP parent vector served as a control. Transfection of these three constructs into Rb-negative Saos-2 cells resulted in expression of the corresponding proteins, which could be detected by Western blotting using anti-GFP and anti-Myc tag antibodies as probes (Fig. 8 B, lanes 2–4). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were observed directly using fluorescence microscopy. Expression of GFP was detected in nuclei and cytoplasm (Fig. 8 C, part b), while GFP-15PA was observed only in the nuclei (Fig. 8 C, part d) and GFP-15Pst was found only in the cytoplasm (Fig. 8 C,part f), consistent with loss of the potential NLS. In contrast to HEC inactivation with anti-HEC antibodies, no abnormal daughter cells were observed under conditions of HEC cytoplasmic accumulation. However, when these cells were immunostained with antibodies specifically recognizing cyclin A or cyclin B, neither cyclin A (Fig. 8 D, part c, arrowhead) nor cyclin B (Fig. 8 E, part c,arrowhead) could be detected in the untransfected cells after telophase. In contrast, in pre- or metaphase cells, both cyclin A and B were detectable (Fig. 8, D and E, labeled with asterisk). In cells expressing GFP-15Pst, cyclin A (Fig. 8 D, part f, arrow) and cyclin B (Fig. 8 E, part f, arrow) were detected even after telophase. These results strongly suggest that overexpression of the C-terminal region of HEC can inhibit the degradation of mitotic cyclins during M phase. Previous studies suggest that HEC is essential for normal mitosis in mammalian cells (20Chen, Y., Riley, D. J., Chen, P.-L., Lee, W.-H., (1997) Mol. Cell. Biol. , 17, in press.Google Scholar). Cells injected with antibodies specific to HEC demonstrate multiple abnormalities with regard to mitosis: 1) chromosomes condense but fail to segregate properly; 2) no metaphase plates are observed; 3) spindles are disorganized in relation to the centromeres; 4) spindles fail to assume the proper orthogonal orientation to chromatids; and 5) cells are able to cytokinese, but chromosomes are separated haphazardly into abnormal, nonviable daughter cells. These studies point to an important role of HEC in cell division. Inactivation of HEC apparently disrupts the delicate regulation of early M phase events. Since a common phenotype of HEC inactivation is a disorganized metaphase plate, HEC action probably begins early in mitosis, perhaps during prophase. The potential substrates for regulating this part of M phase are unknown at the present time. The mechanism by which HEC functions prior to and during mitosis remains to be elucidated. The localization of a portion of HEC at the centromere/kinetochore (20Chen, Y., Riley, D. J., Chen, P.-L., Lee, W.-H., (1997) Mol. Cell. Biol. , 17, in press.Google Scholar) indicates that the protein may be involved in spindle attachment to chromosomes during prophase and indirectly involved in subsequent chromosome movement (34He D. Zeng C. Brinkley B.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162B: 1-74PubMed Google Scholar). However, the lack of a signature tubulin-binding domain in the HEC molecule argues against direct microtubule attachment. The association of HEC with a mitosis-specific kinase and with several subunits of the 26 S proteasome (Table I) suggests potential ways by which HEC may influence chromosome congression, separation, or segregation. In this role, HEC may function as an adaptor molecule through its long leucine heptad repeats, much like the Skp1 protein in budding yeast (35Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 36Connelly C. Hieter P. Cell. 1996; 86: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). HEC may alter the conformation of multiple-subunit complexes and bring together a number of proteins, including components of the mitotic spindle or kinetochore, components of the 26 S proteasome, kinases or phosphatases, and checkpoint monitors. Regulatory events during chromosome alignment and separation are rapid and precisely timed, and they are likely to be profoundly disturbed without appropriate coordinating adaptor molecules. This concept is consistent with the recent finding that the APC, composed of at least seven distinct proteins, is required for both chromosome segregation and exit from mitosis (37Zachariae W. Shin T.H. Galova M. Obermaier B. Nasmyth K. Science. 1996; 274: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 38Peters J.M. King R.W. Hoog C. Kirschner M.W.

HEC is not a component of the 26 S proteasome. It is, however, found in association with MSS1 as part of a smaller complex that appears in the late S to M phase. One explanation of how HEC might regulate mitotic cyclin degradation is that it binds to MSS1 and somehow inhibits its assembly into the 26 S proteasome. Alternatively, HEC may serve as a link between E3/APC/cyclosome (12King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar) and the 26 S proteasome to mediate substrate specificity for controlled proteolysis. In previous experiments, HEC inactivation by antibody injection leads to abnormal mitosis that includes many obvious defects discussed above. Overexpressing a truncated, cytoplasmic form of HEC does not produce exactly the same phenotype in cells. However, the common phenotype observed under conditions of antibody injection and mutant overexpression is that cells progress through cytokinesis, but daughter cells fail to enter the next division and die. Apparently, mutant HEC lacks a dominant negative effect and may fail to form dimers with the wild-type HEC. Since HEC is found in association with a portion of MSS1 separate from the 26 S proteasome specifically in M phase, it is likely that the overexpressed mutant HEC binds to MSS1 during the time when the nuclear membrane breaks down. Consistent with its negative influence on cyclin B degradation in vitro, overexpression of this mutant HEC did result in an abnormal nuclear accumulation of cyclin A and B in cells as late as telophase. Although the precise mechanism for this phenotype is yet to be elucidated, it is likely that mutated HEC disrupts the dynamics of MSS1 availability for 26 S proteasome assembly. In this regard, the N-terminal region of HEC may have important regulatory elements for HEC function. Indeed, it is known to contain at least three recognizable elements: a putative NLS, a Nek2 phosphorylation site (39Lu K.P. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6603-6607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a region for specific interaction with Rb. 2Y. Chen and W.-H. Lee, unpublished observations. These elements may provide an additional mechanism for regulating the quantity and/or quality of HEC during normal progression of the cell cycle. Our working model envisions HEC as an adaptor that inhibits the degradation of mitotic cyclins, thus allowing their accumulation during early M phase. Upon receipt of an unidentified signal, HEC repression is relieved, M phase cyclins are degraded, sister chromatid separation ensues, and cell division is completed. This model as well as the consequence of other HEC interactions are currently under investigation to more fully understand the possible role of HEC in mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2052367668,"We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a protein (designated GCP170) of 1530 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 170 kDa that is localized to the Golgi complex. Hydropathy analysis shows that GCP170 contains no NH2-terminal signal sequence nor a hydrophobic domain sufficient for participating in membrane localization. It is also predicted that GCP170 has characteristic secondary structures including an extremely long α-helical domain that likely forms a coiled-coil between non-coil domains at the NH2 and COOH termini, suggesting that the protein is organized as a globular head, a stalk, and a tail. Immunocytochemical observations revealed that GCP170 was localized to the Golgi complex and the cytoplasm, consistent with biochemical data indicating that the protein exits as a membrane-associated form and a soluble form. GCP170 was dissociated from the Golgi membrane in response to brefeldin A as rapidly as a coat protein complex of non-clathrin-coated vesicles (β-COP, a subunit of coatomer), but did not co-localize with β-COP on the Golgi membrane when examined by immunoelectron microscopy. The protein was detected as phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms, of which the unphosphorylated form was more tightly associated with the Golgi membrane. When cells were extracted with 1% Triton X-100 under microtubule-stabilizing conditions, GCP170 remained in the cells in association with the Golgi complex. These results indicate that GCP170 is a peripheral membrane protein with a long coiled-coil domain that may be involved in the structural organization or stabilization of the Golgi complex.

These results indicate that GCP170 is a peripheral membrane protein with a long coiled-coil domain that may be involved in the structural organization or stabilization of the Golgi complex. The Golgi complex is a highly organized organelle comprised of thecis-Golgi network, Golgi stack, and trans-Golgi network and involved in transport, processing, and sorting of newly synthesized proteins including secretory, plasma membrane and lysosomal proteins (1Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 447-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 2Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 335: 409-415Crossref Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Various enzymes involved in proteolytic and oligosaccharide processing of the transported proteins have been shown to be localized to subcompartments of the Golgi complex (3Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S.

In contrast, there are many cytosolic proteins and cytoplasmically disposed membrane proteins that are involved in the vesicular transport through the Golgi complex (2Rothman J.E. Orci L.

Other cytosolic proteins such asN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein and solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment proteins (SNAPs) and membrane-associated SNAP receptors (SNAREs) are required for attachment and/or fusion of the vesicles to target membranes (10Malhotra V.

Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). The Golgi complex has morphological characteristics that include ordered (from cis to trans) stacking, close apposition, and constant spacing of stacked cisternae. The characteristic stacked structure of the Golgi complex is rapidly disrupted by treatment of cells with brefeldin A (BFA) (13Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol.

Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). The evidence that BFA primarily blocks the budding of transport vesicles (6Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar, 17Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 18Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) indicates that the maintenance of the Golgi structure is supported by the vesicular transport system. In addition, it has been suggested that the stacking of Golgi cisternae can be explained by an extension of the SNARE hypothesis (19Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar); stacking is most simply viewed as an extension of the docking process with the heterotypic v-SNAREs in each cisterna interacting with the cognate t-SNAREs in the next. This would require a mechanism preventing the fusion that leads to vesicular transport, postulating the existence of “fusion clamps” (19Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Whether or not the SNARE system is involved in this process, there may be cytosolic and/or cytoplasmically disposed membrane proteins responsible for the structural maintenance of the Golgi complex, although little is known about them. Recently several new Golgi-associated proteins have been identified by antibodies from patients with autoimmune diseases and by antibodies prepared in animals. These include giantin or GCP372 (20Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.-P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 21Sohda M. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y.

These proteins have several characteristic features. Their molecular masses are quite large, ranging from 370 kDa for the largest giantin/GCP372 to 130 kDa for the smallest GM130/golgin-95. All of them are associated with the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi membrane. Although giantin/GCP372 is an integral membrane protein anchored to the membrane by the COOH-terminal hydrophobic domain (21Sohda M. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Seelig H.P. Schranz P. Schroter H. Wiemann C. Renz M. J. Autoimmun. 1994; 7: 67-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), all the other proteins have no hydrophobic domain that could function as a signal sequence or participate in membrane localization. The most characteristic feature is that all of the proteins have extensively large domains, enabling the formation of coiled-coil structures analogous to the myosin family (21Sohda M. Misumi Y.

Several other proteins involved in membrane targeting and fusion also contain long coiled-coil domains, which are implicated in interactions leading to vesicle targeting and/or fusion (29Achstetter T. Franzusoff A. Field C. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11711-11717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H.-T. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A.

Waters G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, the physiological function of the above mentioned proteins remains to be determined. Golgin-160 is another Golgi-associated protein that was also identified by human autoantibodies (28Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), but its structure and properties have not been well characterized. In the present study, we report the use of a partial cDNA sequence from golgin-160 to isolate a full-length cDNA clone encoding a 170-kDa protein (termed GCP170) and describe the properties of this protein in comparison with those of other Golgi-associated proteins. Western blotting detection kit was purchased from Amersham Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Anti-α-tubulin IgG was from Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan); rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from DAKO Japan (Tokyo, Japan); and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG was from Cappel Laboratories (West Chester, PA). Guinea pig anti-human GCP372 and rabbit anti-β-COP antibodies were prepared as described previously (21Sohda M. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Funaki T. Fujiwara T. Hong H.-S. Misumi Y. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-α-mannosidase II (Man II) was supplied by Dr. K. W. Moremen (University of Georgia). HepG2 (human hepatocarcinoma), QGP-1 (human pancreas carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma), COS-1 (monkey kidney), and baby hamster kidney cells were cultured as described (21Sohda M. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Funaki T. Fujiwara T. Hong H.-S. Misumi Y. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA prepared from QGP-1 cells was used for construction of a cDNA library in λZAPII bacteriophage. A golgin-160 cDNA fragment (28Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR from QGP-1 RNA to obtain a probe for screening and Northern blot analysis. Primers used in the PCR reaction were 5′-GGATCCTGCAGCAGGAGAC-3′ and 5′-GCTTGGAACTGTGCTATCTC-3′. Screening of 1 × 106 independent clones yielded 11 positive clones. These clones were subcloned into pBluescript SK− plasmid vector by automatic excision process (32Misumi Y. Sohda M. Okubo K. Takami N. Oda K. Ikehara Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1990; 108: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A cDNA clone with the longest insert (3.5 kilobase pairs, named QSY103) was subcloned and subjected to nucleotide sequence determination by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (33Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar). To obtain a full-length cDNA, we constructed another cDNA library using a poly(A)+ RNA fraction that was enriched with 7-kb RNA hybridized with a fragment of QSY103 (34Misumi Y. Tashiro K. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Ikehara Y. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Screening 5 × 105 independent clones of the new cDNA library yielded 12 positive clones. A clone with the longest insert obtained (FQSY1024; see Fig. 1) was subcloned, and the nucleotide sequences were determined as above. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to introduce a new EcoRI site at nucleotide 260 and to destroy theEcoRI site at nucleotide 1039 in the GCP170 cDNA (FQSY1024), yielding a clone FQSY1024m that encodes the same amino acid sequence of GCP170. To construct an expression plasmid for fluorescence-microscopic observations, anEcoRI-EcoRI fragment (6.4 kilobase pairs) of FQSY1024m was inserted into the EcoRI site of pGFPC1 (pGFPC1/GCP170), which expressed GCP170 as a fusion protein with the green fluorescent protein (GFP). For metabolic labeling experiments, the EcoRI-EcoRI fragment of FQSY1024m was inserted into the EcoRI site of pSG5 expression vector (pSG/GCP170). Each purified plasmid (10 μg) was transfected into baby hamster kidney cells or COS-1 cells as described previously (5Misumi Y. Oda K. Fujiwara T. Takami N. Tashiro K. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16954-16959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeric proteins of GCP170 fragments fused to the COOH terminus of glutathioneS-transferase were prepared using the expression vector pGEX3X (35Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Two cDNA fragments of GCP170 (corresponding to amino acid number 827–990 and 1136–1231 in Fig. 2) prepared in pT7-blue were digested with BamHI and EcoRI, purified by gel electrophoresis, and ligated to theBamHI-EcoRI site of pGEX3X vector. The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins with expected molecular masses were obtained by culture of recombinant bacteria and purified (35Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). These two recombinant proteins were mixed and injected into rabbits to raise anti-GCP170 antibodies. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic observations were carried out as described before (21Sohda M. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence staining were as follows; rabbit anti-GCP170 serum (dilution factor, 1:50), anti-α-tubulin serum (1:100), anti-β-COP IgG (15 μg/ml), and guinea pig anti-GCP372 serum (1:50). Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG (1:50) was used as a secondary antibody. When indicated, cells were extracted with 1% Triton X-100, 80 mm PIPES buffer (pH 6.8), 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 2 m glycerol (microtubule-stabilizing buffer), or with 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 5 mmCaCl2, and 150 mm NaCl (microtubule-destabilizing buffer) before fixation. Cells were also treated with BFA or with nocodazole as described (25Funaki T. Fujiwara T. Hong H.-S. Misumi Y. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 36Turner J.R. Tartakoff A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2081-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For immunoelectron microscopic observations, rabbit anti-GCP170 serum (1:100) or anti-β-COP IgG (10 μg/ml) was used as a primary antibody, which was detected with gold-conjugated protein A. This was performed as described previously (25Funaki T. Fujiwara T. Hong H.-S. Misumi Y. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In brief, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE (5 or 7% gels) were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), followed by incubation with anti-GCP170 serum (1:800) or with anti-Mann II serum (1:1000). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:2000) were used as secondary antibodies. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) kit. HepG2 cells were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 2 mm EDTA (homogenizing buffer) with a nitrogen bombardment apparatus (Parr Instrument Co.), followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The resultant postnuclear supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 1 h into a pellet (membrane fraction) and a supernatant (cytosol fraction). A Golgi fraction was prepared by flotation of the postnuclear supernatant in a sucrose gradient as described by Balch et al. (37Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Praell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The Golgi membrane was sedimentated by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in the homogenizing buffer containing either 0–0.5m KCl, 1 m NaCl, or 0.1 mNa2CO3. After being incubated on ice for 30 min, the suspensions were centrifuged at 105,000 × gfor 30 min to obtain supernatants and membrane pellets. Phase separation of the indicated samples in a Triton X-114 solution was carried out by the method of Bordier (38Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Golgi fraction (1 mg protein/ml) was incubated at 0 °C for 30 min with a mixture of chymotrypsin and trypsin (50 μg each/ml) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl with or without 1% Triton X-100. HepG2 cells (4 × 106 cells/dish) or transfected COS-1 cells (5 × 106 cells/dish) were labeled at 37 °C for 5 h with [35S]methionine (4 MBq/dish) in 2 ml of minimum essential medium lacking unlabeled methionine or with [32P]orthophosphate (20 MBq/dish) in 2 ml of phosphate-free minimum essential medium. Cell lysates were prepared in a solution containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.01% SDS, and a protease inhibitor mixture and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-GCP170 antibodies in combination with protein A-Sepharose as described previously (13Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes were boiled in Laemmli's sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (5% or 7% gels) and fluorography (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates prepared from 35S-labeled cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or the absence of bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase (50 units/ml), followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as above. Nucleotide and protein sequences were analyzed by the GENETX genetic information processing software (Software Development Co., Tokyo, Japan) and FASTA program at the DNA Data Bank of Japan (Mishima, Japan). Coiled-coil graphs were made from data generated by the COILS (version 2.1) algorithm of Swiss Cancer Research Institute (40Lupas A. van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar). The MTDIK matrix and a window size of 28 residues were used. Based on the available SY2 sequence (28Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), a cDNA fragment was obtained by the reverse transcription-PCR method using QGP-1 RNA as a template (PCR probe in Fig. 1 A). Screening of 1 × 106 clones of the QGP-1 cDNA library with the probe yielded 11 positive clones, of which clone QSY103 had the longest insert of 3.3 kb. Because Northern blot analysis showed the presence of a single 7-kb RNA (Fig. 1 B), we further screened another cDNA library constructed from a 7-kb RNA-enriched fraction and finally isolated a clone, FQSY1024, with a longer insert of 6.6 kb containing an open reading frame (Fig. 1 A). The open reading frame encodes a protein of 1530 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 170 kDa (Fig.2 A). We designated the protein GCP170 (for the Golgi complex-associatedprotein of 170 kDa). The protein does not contain a sequence characteristic of a signal sequence at the NH2 terminus nor a hydrophobic domain sufficient to span a membrane in the entire sequence, as shown by a hydropathy analysis (Fig. 2 B). Search of the protein data base shows that GCP170 has no overall homology to known proteins nor particular motifs except for phosphorylation sites. Secondary structure analysis for coiled-coil probabilities (40Lupas A. van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar) predicts that GCP170 consists of three major domains: an NH2-terminal non-coil (positions 1–400), a long α-helical domain with strong coiled-coil forming potential (positions 400–1400), and a COOH-terminal non-coil domain (1400–1530), although the coiled-coil domain has an interruption (about 60 residues) (Fig. 2 C). The NH2-terminal non-coil domain contains a proline-rich region and a serine-rich region (Fig. 2 A). Thus, it is likely that GCP170 has a domain structure with a globular head, long stalk, and short tail, similar to kinesin (41Hirokawa N. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 135-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and CLIP-170 (42Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 178-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), although they have no significant homology to each other. Immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-recombinant GCP170 showed that GCP170 was concentrated at juxta-nuclear regions corresponding to the Golgi complex, although its presence in the cytoplasm was also suggested by faint and diffuse staining of whole cells (Fig. 3 a). The same perinuclear regions were co-stained with antibodies to GCP372, a Golgi-membrane-anchored protein (21Sohda M. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 b). The general staining pattern of GCP170 was most similar to that of β-COP, a subunit of coatomer (Fig. 3 c). Both GCP170 and β-COP displayed heavy staining of the Golgi region and faint staining throughout the cytoplasm, in contrast to the staining profile of GCP372, which was confined to the Golgi region. A more detailed localization of GCP170 was attained by immunoelectron microscopy (Fig.3 d). The immunogold particles were detected at the rims of cisternal structures and related elements characteristic of the Golgi complex. The gold particles were not significantly detected in other organelles including nuclei, mitochondria, and lysosomes, although some were found in the cytoplasm free from membrane association. A postnuclear fraction of HepG2 cells was subfractionated into cytosol, total membrane, and Golgi fractions, which were analyzed by Western blotting. Anti-GCP170 antibodies recognized a 170-kDa protein not only in the Golgi and total membrane fractions but also in the cytosol (Fig.4 A). GCP170 was found to be more abundant in the cytosol than in the total membranes, although it was much enriched in the Golgi fraction. The membrane topology of GCP170 was examined using protease treatment. When the intact Golgi fraction was incubated with trypsin and chymotrypsin, GCP170 was completely digested even in the absence of a detergent (Fig.4 B, upper panel), whereas Man II, which has a cytoplasmic tail of only 5 amino acids, was degraded only when incubated with the detergent (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). In addition, GCP170 was completely released from the membrane with sodium carbonate, although not completely extracted with 1 m NaCl, and entirely partitioned into an aqueous phase when subjected to Triton X-114 phase separation (Fig. 4 C). Taken together, these results indicate that GCP-170 is a peripheral protein associated with the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi membrane. The product encoded by the GCP170 cDNA was examined by transfection experiments in baby hamster kidney cells. Because the anti-GCP170 antibodies were found to cross-react with cells derived from other species and could not distinguish exogenously introduced GCP170 from the endogenous protein, we transfected the plasmid pGFPC1/GCP170 into cells, which expressed a fusion protein containing the GFP as a reporter. Fluorescence microscopy shows essentially the same profile between the immunostaining and the GFP image (Fig.5 A, a andb), demonstrating that the fusion protein expressed is concentrated in the Golgi complex. Immunoprecipitation experiments were also carried out, for which cells were transfected with the plasmid pSG5 carrying the GCP170 cDNA and metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. GCP170 expressed in the transfected cells was very heavily labeled and had the same molecular mass as that from HepG2 cells (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and 3). In this experiment, we used 5% gels for SDS-PAGE, under the conditions of which GCP170 was resolved into two closely migrating forms, although they migrated as an apparently single form when analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7% gels (Fig. 4). Smaller bands detected in the transfected cells (Fig. 5 B, lane 1) may be mostly degradation products of GCP170. The presence of the doublet GCP170 (Fig. 5 B) may be explained by the expression of independent molecules with similar epitopes reactive with the anti-GCP170 or by modifications such as phos"

Furthermore, hLIF binds with much higher affinity to the mouse LIFR (mLIFR) α-chain than does mLIF itself. To define the structural elements of the mLIFR α-chain conferring high affinity binding of hLIF and the species-specific interaction with mLIF, we first constructed C-terminally truncated extracellular domains of both the mLIFR and the human LIFR (hLIFR) α-chains, which contained only the two hemopoietin domains separated by an immunoglobulin-like domain.

On the basis of this, we have generated eight interspecies receptor chimeras by combining different regions of the mouse and human LIFR sequence. Surprisingly, the immunoglobulin-like domain of the mLIFR α-chain played the predominant role in receptor-ligand interactions.

Int. J. Cell Cloning. 1991; 9: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Subsequently, LIF has been shown to have a wide variety of actions in many different cell types and tissues including adipocytes, osteoblasts, megakaryocytes, hepatocytes, neurons, embryonal stem cells, and primordial germ cells (reviewed in Ref. 2Hilton D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 72-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A critical role of LIF in the implantation process has been implicated, since mice in which the LIF gene has been ablated are essentially normal but are unable to implant their otherwise viable blastocysts (3Stewart C.L. Kaspar P. Brunet L.J. Bhatt H. Gadi I. Kontgen F. Abbondanzo S.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). LIF exerts its biological actions through high affinity receptors that are expressed on the surface of LIF-responsive cells. The high affinity LIF receptor (LIFR) complex is composed of two components: the LIFR α-chain, which binds LIF with low affinity, and gp130, which does not itself bind LIF but is essential for high affinity complex formation and signal transduction (4Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K. King J.A. Gillis S. Mosley B. Ziegler S.F. Cosman D. Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). The LIFR α-chain and gp130 are components of other receptor systems including those of oncostatin M (4Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K. King J.A.

Targeted disruption of the LIFR α-chain results in mutant animals with neuronal, musculo-skeletal, placental, and metabolic defects (12Ware C.B. Horowitz M.C. Renshaw B.R. Hunt J.S. Liggitt D.

Development. 1995; 121: 1283-1299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice carrying the LIFR nullizygous mutation died shortly after birth, indicating that the LIFR α-chain is necessary for normal development and survival. Human and mouse low affinity LIF receptors have been biochemically characterized, and cDNA clones that encode these receptors have been described (13Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandeBos T. Gimpel S.D.

Biochem. 1994; 115: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The LIFR α-chain is a member of the hemopoietin family of receptors (15Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). In contrast to the majority of the members of this family, the LIFR α-chain contains in its extracellular domain two copies of the hemopoietin domain, which are separated by an immunoglobulin-like domain (13Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandeBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 16Cosman D. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Similar to the G-CSF receptor (17Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Seto Y. Nagata S.

Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar), the LIFR α-chain also contains three fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats that are located C-terminal to the membrane proximal hemopoietin domain. Mutagenesis studies of the G-CSF receptor (19Fukunaga R. Ishizaka I.E. Pan C.X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and gp130 (20Horsten U. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Mullberg J. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have indicated that the FNIII repeats are not essential for ligand binding. The interaction of LIF with its receptor α-chain is complex. The primary binding affinities of both mouse and human LIF for their respective α-chains are relatively low (K d of ∼1–2 nm), but, whereas mouse LIF (mLIF) binds to its receptor α-chain with apparent single-site kinetics, human LIF (hLIF) binds to its receptor α-chain with biphasic kinetics. This led us to speculate that hLIF binding to the α-chain is associated with a receptor isomerization process, the two forms of which correspond to fast or slow kinetic dissociation rates (21Layton M.J. Lock P. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17048-17055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, hLIF bound to the mLIF receptor (mLIFR) α-chain with a much higher affinity (K d ∼ 10–20 pm) than it did to the isologous human LIF receptor (hLIFR) α-chain or than mLIF binding to the mLIFR α-chain. Cross-competition studies using the mLIFR α-chain revealed that the competition curves were dependent on which LIF was used as the radioactive tracer, and this behavior was interpreted as an interference by each type of LIF in the binding of the other. A model was proposed to rationalize these complex interactions. In this model, hLIF is bound to both mouse and human LIF receptors through two different sites, a primary binding site and a secondary site induced by ligand-dependent receptor isomerization. The overall binding affinity and the presence or absence of two kinetic sites were determined by the isomerization equilibrium, with rapid isomerization favoring high affinity and single-site kinetics, while slow isomerization favored low affinity and two-site kinetics. Ligand interference in this model could be explained by the ability of mLIF or hLIF to favor different isomerization states of the mLIFR α-chain (Fig. 1). Recently, we have exploited this unusual cross-species reactivity to map the binding epitope on hLIF that is responsible, on the one hand, for binding to the hLIFR α-chain and, on the other, for binding with high affinity to the mLIFR α-chain (22Owczarek C.M. Layton M.J. Metcalf D. Lock P. Willson T.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3487-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Layton M.J. Owczarek C.M. Metcalf D. Clark R.L. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29891-29896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies identified an identical set of six amino acids in hLIF, suggesting that the site B shown in Fig. 1 for interaction with the mLIFR α-chain is the same site as hLIF used as the primary binding site for the hLIFR α-chain. A soluble form of the mLIFR α-chain occurs at high levels (2 μg/ml) in normal mouse serum and is dramatically elevated in pregnancy (24Layton M.J. Cross B.A. Metcalf D. Ward L.D. Simpson R.J. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8616-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar,25Tomida M. Yamamoto-Yamaguchi Y. Hozumi M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The very high binding affinity of this receptor for hLIF makes it a potent biological inhibitor of hLIF (21Layton M.J. Lock P. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17048-17055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that it could be useful in clinical situations like inflammatory disease where LIF levels are expected to be elevated. The present studies were undertaken to identify the region of the mLIFR α-chain responsible for high affinity interactions with hLIF. Again, we have taken advantage of the structural homology of mouse and human LIF receptors and their different binding characteristics for mouse and human LIF to generate interspecies receptor chimeras. These studies should help to define the structural elements involved in LIF binding and in developing a “humanized” mouse LIFR α-chain that retains its high affinity binding to hLIF as a possible therapeutic agent. A cDNA encoding a soluble mouse LIFR α-chain was a gift from Dr. D. J. Hilton of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. The 5′-end was modified to encode an XhoI site and an in frame 12CA5 epitope. The 3′-end of the mLIFR cDNA was modified to encode an XbaI site, and a stop codon was introduced after amino acid residue 531 in the amino acid sequence described in Ref. 13Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandeBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar. A cDNA encoding the hLIFR α-chain (22Owczarek C.M. Layton M.J. Metcalf D. Lock P. Willson T.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3487-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was also altered at its 5′-end to encode an XhoI site and an in frame 12CA5 epitope (YPYDVPDYA) (26Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The sequence at the N terminus of the recombinant mLIFR was GVQYPYDVPDYA, and the sequence at the N terminus of the recombinant hLIFR was GAPYPYDVPDYA. The 3′-end was also modified to encode an XbaI site, and a stop codon was introduced after position 536 in the amino acid sequence described by Gearing et al. (13Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandeBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The recombinant LIFRs therefore lacked the cytoplasmic domain, transmembrane domain, and all three FNIII-like domains. The resulting cDNAs were subsequently ligated into thePichia pastoris expression vector pPIC9, which was digested with XhoI and AvrII, asXhoI-XbaI fragments. Mutagenesis of the LIFR cDNAs and construction of hybrid mouse-human LIFRs were carried out using a polymerase chain reaction-based technique, splicing by overlap extension (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar), and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequences of the resulting constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (28Sanger F.A. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar) using either a PRISM Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing kit on an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer or a T7-based Pharmacia Dideoxy sequencing kit. All cDNAs were expressed as soluble secreted proteins in the methylotrophic yeastP. pastoris. This expression system uses the promoter from the methanol-induced alcohol oxidase gene, AOX1. Stably expressing clones are selected using the HIS4 gene as a selectable marker. The recombinant plasmids were digested with eitherBglII or SalI and integrated into host cells by transforming his4 (GS115) P. pastorisspheroplasts as described (29Cregg J.M. Barringer K.J. Hessler A.Y. Madden K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Digestion of a plasmid withBglII disrupts the AOX1 gene and results in a strain that is phenotypically His+Muts(methanol utilization sensitive). Because plasmids MH1LIFR, MH3LIFR, MH5LIFR, and MH7LIFR contained BglII sites, they were digested with SalI prior to transformation into P. pastoris spheroplasts. The resulting strains were His+Mut+. His+ transformants were patched first onto a nitrocellulose filter overlaid onto an agar plate (MM) containing 0.5% methanol, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, and 4 × 10−5% biotin and then onto another agar plate (MD) containing 1% dextrose instead of methanol as the carbon source. The plates were incubated at 30 °C. After 48 h, the clones on the MD agar plate were placed at 4 °C. The nitrocellulose filters containing the His+ transformants were then lifted off the MM plates and incubated in 10% (w/v) skim milk powder in PBS. Colonies that expressed recombinant LIF receptors were then detected using a 12CA5 antibody. Clones identified in this way were grown in a shaking incubator at 30 °C to an A 600 of 2–6 in 10 ml of medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6), 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10−5% biotin, and 1% glycerol. After 5-fold concentration by centrifugation, the cultures were resuspended in medium that contained 0.5% methanol instead of glycerol to induce the cells to express the heterologous protein. Expression of the recombinant receptors was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of the culture supernatants, followed by both Western blotting and detection with 12CA5 antibody and binding assays to 125I-hLIF. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred onto prewetted polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF-Plus, Micron Separations Inc.) membrane using a transfer buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm glycine, pH 8.2, and 20% (v/v) methanol in a Mini-Protean II system (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in PBS containing no sodium azide, followed by incubation with mouse 12CA5 antibody and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (DAKO, Denmark). The receptor proteins were visualized using an ECL substrate kit (Amersham Corp.) followed by autoradiography. Recombinant mLIF or hLIF produced in Escherichia coli was purified and iodinated as described previously (30Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Metcalf D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5971-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All binding experiments for soluble receptors were performed in duplicate using concanavalin A-Sepharose beads to precipitate the soluble receptor complexes. Nonspecific binding and the separation of bound and free labeled LIF were determined as described previously (21Layton M.J. Lock P. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17048-17055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Scatchard analyses of saturation binding isotherms were performed using the curve-fitting program LIGAND (31Munson P.J.

Experiments to determine the kinetic dissociation rate (k off) were carried out by preincubating soluble receptors, immobilized on concanavalin A-Sepharose beads, with125I-hLIF at a final concentration of 105cpm/60 μl in the presence and absence of 8 μg/ml unlabeled hLIF. When the specific interaction had reached an equilibrium, the precipitated receptor complexes were collected by rapid centrifugation (3 s). Dissociation of the 125I-hLIF was initiated by immediately resuspending the receptor complexes in the same volume of ice-cold RHF (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with Hepes and fetal calf serum) containing 20 μg/ml unlabeled hLIF. At various times thereafter, 60-μl aliquots of suspension were removed, and bound and free 125I-hLIF were separated and counted as described previously (21Layton M.J. Lock P. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17048-17055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P. pastorisexpression supernatant was concentrated 6–50-fold using a Centricon-50 microconcentrator (Amicon). Aliquots (200–500 μl) of each sample were injected onto a Superose-12 10/30 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column equilibrated in PBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween-20, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. Elution was carried out isocratically using the same buffer and monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The 0.5-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. An aliquot of each fraction was tested for 125I-hLIF binding as described previously. Each chimeric LIF receptor sample (0.25–0.5 nm) was mixed with approximately 1.6 nm of 125I-hLIF (200,000 cpm) in 20 μl of PBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, in the presence or absence of 100 ng of unlabeled hLIF, and the binding reaction was performed for 90 min at room temperature. After incubation, 10 μl of 7.5 mmbis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)-suberate (Pierce), which was dissolved in PBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, was added as a chemical cross-linker, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The cross-linked proteins were analyzed by 10% PAGE in the presence of 0.1% (v/v) SDS under nonreducing conditions, followed by autoradiography. Aliquots of either P. pastorissupernatant or concentrated fractions pooled from a Superose-12 column containing 0.1–1 μg/ml of recombinant LIF receptor protein were exchanged into normal saline containing 5% fetal calf serum using prepacked Sephadex G-25 m (PD10 column, Pharmacia), and sterilized by passage through a 0.22-μm (pore size) filter (Millipore Corp.). M1 differentiation assays were performed as described (33Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Leukemia. 1988; 2: 216-221PubMed Google Scholar). Normal mouse serum (containing approximately 2 μg/ml of mLIFR α-chain (mLBP)) was used as a positive control. M1 cells (107 per sample) were stimulated for 5 min at 37 °C with 1 ng of hLIF, 1 ng of hLIF together with 11 ng of each chimeric LIFR, or 11 ng of each chimeric LIFR and then lysed in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, and proteinase inhibitors. After pelleting insoluble material and protein standardization, the supernatants were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) for 1 h and then immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and protein A-Sepharose beads. The immune complexes were washed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, and proteinase inhibitors, eluted from the Sepharose beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer under reducing conditions for 5 min before being subjected to 4–20% acrylamide SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a prewetted polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF-Plus, Micron Separations Inc.). After blocking, the membrane was incubated with an anti-STAT3 polyclonal antibody (K-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by incubation with a goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin polyclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (DAKO, Denmark). The phosphorylated STAT3 protein was visualized by radiography using an ECL system (Amersham). Quantitation of STAT3 phosphorylation levels was performed by densitometric analysis of the band intensities using ImageQuant version 3.0 software. We have previously reported that mLIF binds to the mLIFR α-chain with low affinity (K d of ∼1–4 nm) but does not detectably interact with the hLIFR α-chain (22Owczarek C.M. Layton M.J. Metcalf D. Lock P. Willson T.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3487-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Layton M.J. Owczarek C.M. Metcalf D. Clark R.L. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29891-29896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human LIF binds to the hLIFR α-chain with low affinity (K d of ∼0.3–1 nm), but it is also able to bind to the mLIFR α-chain and does so with a much higher affinity (K d of ∼10–20 pm) than mLIF. The higher affinity binding of hLIF to the mLIFR α-chain was found to be due almost exclusively to a slower kinetic dissociation rate compared with mLIF. There were thus several different characteristics that a LIF receptor that was composed of a combination of mouse and human sequence might acquire. Any combination of mouse and human LIFR sequence should, however, result in a hybrid molecule that is at least able to bind 125I-hLIF with low affinity. To assess the relative contributions of the different mouse or human LIF receptor domains to these different features, we constructed a series of hybrid mouse-human LIF receptors in which the two hemopoietin domains and the Ig-like domain were present in various combinations of mouse or human LIFR sequence and expressed them as soluble recombinant proteins (Fig.2). The boundaries between the different domains were delineated as described by Gearing et al.(13Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandeBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). We initially expressed mouse LIFR and human LIFR as soluble proteins that were truncated 13 amino acid residues after the predicted membrane proximal hemopoietin domain. These receptors therefore did not contain the cytoplasmic domain, the transmembrane domain, and all three fibronectin type III repeats that are present in native cellular LIF receptors. The recombinant proteins were modified at their N termini to encode a 12CA5 epitope tag (26Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) to monitor their expression and contained the yeast α-factor signal peptide to enable the proteins to be secreted into the culture medium after transformation into yeast. The molecular weight of these recombinant receptors is predicted to be approximately 65 kDa. Scatchard analysis of 125I-mLIF to the recombinant mLIFR α-chain showed a single class of mLIF binding site (K d of ∼6–7 nm), which is essentially the same as that for mLBP (K d of ∼1–4 nm) and the low affinity mLIFR formed by detergent solubilization of mLIFRs present on liver membranes or activated macrophages (34Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10238-10247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of125I-hLIF to the recombinant soluble mLIFR α-chain displayed a K d value of 10–46 pm. Both of these results are essentially identical to the values obtained previously (21Layton M.J. Lock P. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17048-17055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of 125I-hLIF to the recombinant soluble hLIFR α-chain showed a K d value of 0.3–0.93 nm, which again was in the normal range for 125I-hLIF binding (TableI). These results indicated that the minimum ligand-binding domain of both the human and mouse LIFR α-chains is composed of the membrane-distal and membrane-proximal hemopoietin domains plus the intervening Ig-like domain.Table ILIF binding properties of chimeric LIF receptorsReceptorK d 1-aThese estimates of Kd values are from 2–6 experiments.k off1-bThe k off values are the average of at least two experiments.125I-hLIFID501-fID50 values (±20%) are the average of at least two experiments.125I-hLIF125I-mLIFFast1-cFast dissociation rate (±50%).Slow1-dSlow dissociation rate (±50%).hLIFmLIFpMmin−11/Kc(F/S)eμg/mlmLIFR10–466 nm0.0010.010.01632MH1LIFR190–400ND1-gND, not detectable.0.030.0010.20.02040MH2LIFR150–440ND0.040.0010.20.02059MH3LIFR11–60ND0.0020.10.01854MH4LIFR11–58ND0.0020.10.01436MH5LIFR13–61ND0.0020.10.01828MH6LIFR158–380ND0.050.0010.280.048NDMH7LIFR230–545ND0.070.0010.700.034NDMH8LIFR700–2600ND0.20.0020.800.089NDhLIFR300–900ND0.160.0020.520.250ND1-e1/Kc, isomerization constant, is the ratio of the fast dissociating form (F) over the slow dissociating form (S) at equilibrium.1-a These estimates of Kd values are from 2–6 experiments.1-b The k off values are the average of at least two experiments.1-c Fast dissociation rate (±50%).1-d Slow dissociation rate (±50%).1-f ID50 values (±20%) are the average of at least two experiments.1-g ND, not detectable.

Previous studies demonstrated that palytoxin stimulates a sodium-dependent signaling pathway that activates the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK) in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. In this study we show that a JNK kinase known as the stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 (SEK1) plays an important role in the regulation of JNK by palytoxin. We found that palytoxin stimulates the sustained activation of both JNK and SEK1 in COS7 and HeLa cells. Transiently expressed SEK1 isolated from palytoxin-treated cells can phosphorylate and activate JNK, which, in turn, can phosphorylate c-Jun. Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative mutant of SEK1 blocks activation of JNK by palytoxin. Sodium appears to play an important role in the regulation of JNK and SEK1 by palytoxin. Activation of JNK and SEK1 by palytoxin, but not anisomycin, requires extracellular sodium. Complementary studies showed that the sodium ionophore gramicidin can mimic palytoxin by regulating JNK and SEK1 through a sodium-dependent mechanism. Collectively, these results demonstrate that palytoxin stimulates a sodium-dependent signaling pathway that activates the SEK1/JNK/c-Jun protein kinase cascade.

The biochemical mechanism of action of the skin tumor promoter palytoxin differs significantly from that of the prototypical phorbol ester tumor promoters. Although palytoxin is as potent as phorbol esters in the two-stage mouse skin assay, this marine toxin does not activate protein kinase C and is therefore classified as a non-TPA 1The abbreviations used are: TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; SEK1, stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MKK and MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase; SPRK, src-homology 3 domain-containing proline-rich kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; SEK1, stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MKK and MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase; SPRK, src-homology 3 domain-containing proline-rich kinase.-type tumor promoter (1Fujiki H.

Indeed, the structure of palytoxin suggests that it would it have a receptor type different from that of phorbol esters. In contrast to phorbol esters, which are lipophilic, palytoxin is a large (M r 2,681), water-soluble polyalcohol (2Moore R.E. Fortsch. Chem. Org. Naturst. 1985; 48: 81-202PubMed Google Scholar). The putative receptor for palytoxin is Na+,K+-ATPase (3Habermann E. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 1171-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Palytoxin appears to bind to Na+,K+-ATPase and either transform the pump into a sodium channel or form a sodium channel closely associated with this ion pump. Consequently, palytoxin stimulates sodium influx in every system where it has been tested (3Habermann E. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 1171-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Presumably, the modulation of signal transduction pathways through activation of protein kinase C plays an important role in the carcinogenic effects of phorbol esters (4Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5757) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether palytoxin-stimulated sodium influx can also modulate signal transduction pathways that may be involved in carcinogenesis. Recent studies demonstrated that palytoxin can stimulate the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK) through a sodium-dependent pathway in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (5Kuroki D.W. Bignami G.S. Wattenberg E.V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar). JNK presents an important target for elucidating the signaling pathways that transduce the novel signals stimulated by palytoxin. JNK is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of serine/threonine kinases (6Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 7Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar, 8Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). One important function of MAPKs is to regulate gene expression. Upon activation by intracellular signals, MAPKs translocate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate transcription factors (9Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, JNK is generally activated by agents that induce cellular stress, including UV light, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and hyperosmotic conditions (6Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 7Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar, 8Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Once activated, JNK can translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate c-Jun on Ser-63 and Ser-73 and thereby stimulate transcriptional activation (6Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). JNK may be a significant target for palytoxin action, providing a mechanism for transducing palytoxin-stimulated signals to the nucleus. In particular, the fact that c-Jun is a proto-oncogene product underscores the potential importance of aberrant regulation of JNK in carcinogenesis. Another member of the MAPK family, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), is generally activated by growth factors and other mitogenic agents (10Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). ERK also translocates to the nucleus upon activation and modulates gene expression through phosphorylation of transcription factors, including Elk-1 (11Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 12Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4930-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that phorbol esters, which are mitogenic, selectively activate ERK but not JNK in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, whereas the non-TPA-type tumor promoter palytoxin selectively activates JNK but not ERK in this cell type (5Kuroki D.W. Bignami G.S. Wattenberg E.V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that both phorbol esters and palytoxin can activate MAPKs, although these distinct types of tumor promoters regulate different members of this kinase family. Determining how palytoxin regulates JNK may help reveal the mechanisms by which the signals stimulated by palytoxin are transduced through the cell. JNK is activated by dual phosphorylation of Thr-183 and Tyr-185 (14Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar). Stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 (SEK1, also called JNKK and MKK4) has been identified as a kinase that can directly phosphorylate and activate JNK (15Sánchez I.

Therefore, to elucidate further the signal transduction pathways activated by palytoxin, we investigated the role of SEK1 in the regulation of JNK by palytoxin. The results from these studies support an important role for SEK1 in a protein kinase cascade that transduces the novel sodium-dependent signals stimulated by palytoxin.

Briefly, COS7 or HeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a gassed (5% CO2), humidified incubator.

GST-SEK1 was isolated as described above for the SEK1 assay. The GST-SEK1·GSH-agarose complex was washed and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in the kinase buffer with 2 μg of GST-JNK1 and 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP followed by incubation for 15 min in the presence of 1 μg of GST-c-Jun and an additional 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 10% minigel. Phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography. The assay for ERK activation is essentially the same as the SEK1 assay except that cells were transiently transfected with pEBG-GST-ERK1, the GST-ERK1·GSH-agarose complex was incubated in a kinase buffer with 1 μg of myelin basic protein instead of JNK1, and proteins were resolved using a 12% minigel. Cultures of COS7 cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of pSRαHA-JNK1 and either 1.5 μg/plate empty pEBG-GST vector or 1.5 μg/plate pEBG-GST-SEK1(K-R)/35-mm plate using LipofectAMINE. Cells were serum starved and treated with the appropriate agent as described for the SEK1 assay. Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm Na3VO4 and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 14,000 × g. HA-JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with an anti-HA antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) and protein-G agarose (Sigma). Immunocomplexes were washed and incubated in a kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 μmNa3VO4, and 20 μm ATP) in the presence of 2 μg of GST-c-Jun and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 10% minigel. Phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography. Cells were plated and treated with the appropriate agent as described above for the JNK assay. Cultures were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 40 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.02 mm leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4. Equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% minigel and then transferred to nitrocellulose paper (Amersham Corp.). The blots were blocked in a Tris-buffered saline solution containing 5% non-fat dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20. The primary antibody used was an anti-phospho-specific SEK1/MKK4 polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The secondary antibody was a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma). Western blot analysis was carried out according to the protocol recommended by Amersham. The signal was detected using the ECL detection system purchased from Amersham. Previous studies demonstrated that treatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with palytoxin stimulates the activation of JNK (5Kuroki D.W. Bignami G.S. Wattenberg E.V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar). To begin elucidating the signaling cascade by which palytoxin regulates JNK, we determined if palytoxin activates the JNK kinase SEK1. Fig.1 shows that treatment of either COS7 or HeLa cells with 300 pm palytoxin activates both JNK and SEK1 (Fig. 1). We measured endogenous JNK activity using a method that takes advantage of the fact that JNK binds tightly to its c-Jun substrate. Whole cell extracts were incubated with a GST-c-Jun fusion protein bound to GSH-agarose beads. After extensive washing, the complex was incubated with a kinase buffer in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and the proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of the GST-c-Jun fusion protein indicates JNK activation. In COS7 cells, palytoxin stimulated JNK activation to an extent similar to other known activators of JNK, including the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, hyperosmotic medium, UV light, and TNF-α (Fig. 1 A). Likewise, palytoxin stimulated substantial JNK activation in HeLa cells (Fig. 1 C). In contrast to palytoxin, treatment of COS7 or HeLa cells with the phorbol ester PDBu resulted in only minimal activation of JNK (Fig. 1,A and C). Two types of experiments indicate that palytoxin regulates SEK1 (Fig.1, B, D, and E). First, we determined if palytoxin could activate SEK1 when it was transiently expressed as the fusion protein GST-SEK1 in COS7 and HeLa cells (Fig. 1,B and D). Treatment of either COS7 or HeLa cells with palytoxin caused a dramatic increase in SEK1 activity relative to controls, as monitored by the phosphorylation of recombinant JNK (Fig.1, B and D). Consistent with the results describing JNK activation, palytoxin activated SEK1 to an extent similar to anisomycin, hyperosmotic medium, UV light, or TNF-α in COS7 cells (Fig. 1 B). Palytoxin also stimulated a dramatic increase in SEK1 activity in HeLa cells (Fig. 1 D). PDBu caused minimal activation of SEK1 in COS7 and HeLa cells, which corresponds to its minimal activation of JNK (Fig. 1, B andD). These results demonstrate that palytoxin can stimulate signals that activate SEK1. Next, we investigated whether palytoxin treatment could regulate endogenous SEK1 (Fig. 1 E). SEK1 is activated by phosphorylation of a serine residue and a threonine residue located in the kinase subdomain VIII (15Sánchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 16Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J.

Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). We monitored the effect of palytoxin on phosphorylation of endogenous SEK1 using Western blot analysis and a polyclonal antibody specific for the phosphothreonine located in subdomain VIII in human SEK1 (Fig. 1 E). The phospho-SEK1-specific antibody reacted with a band (P-SEK1) whose molecular mass was similar to that of SEK1 (45 kDa) (22Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12969-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which appeared in lanes containing protein from palytoxin-treated HeLa cells and HeLa cells treated with the established SEK1 activator anisomycin (15Sánchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 E). This band did not appear in the lanes containing protein from control cells or cells treated with PDBu (Fig.1 E). It is likely that Western blot analysis is not sensitive enough to detect the low level of SEK1 phosphorylation which would correspond to the low level of SEK1 activation stimulated by PDBu. The nonspecific band that appears in the Western blot indicates that similar amounts of protein were loaded in each lane. We were not able to detect the phospho-SEK1 band in COS7 cells treated with either palytoxin or anisomycin using Western blot analysis. 2D. W. Kuroki and E. V. Wattenberg, unpublished results. Two likely explanations, which require further investigation, are that 1) COS7 cells have a much lower level of SEK1 than HeLa cells or 2) this antibody does not cross-react with the SEK1 expressed in COS7 cells, which is a monkey cell line. In essence, the results from the Western blot correspond to the results obtained monitoring SEK1 activity in HeLa cells using the transient expression assay (Fig.1 D). To investigate the relationship between the activation of SEK1 and JNK by palytoxin, we first compared the kinetics of activation of these two kinases in COS7 and HeLa cells treated with palytoxin (Fig.2). The time courses of palytoxin-stimulated SEK1 and JNK activation were similar when measured in either COS7 cells (Fig. 2 A) or HeLa cells (Fig.2 B). We detected an increase in SEK1 activation relative to background (the zero time point) within 5 min of palytoxin treatment in both COS7 and HeLa cells (Fig. 2). An increase in JNK activity was also detected within 5 min of palytoxin treatment in HeLa cells (Fig.2 B). COS7 cells have a relatively high basal level of JNK activity compared with HeLa cells (compare the Control lanesin Fig. 1, A and C). Therefore, it was difficult to detect a small increase in JNK activity at early time points in COS7 cells. A more detailed temporal analysis revealed that palytoxin-stimulated SEK1 activation could be detected earlier than palytoxin-stimulated JNK activation in HeLa cells (Fig. 2 B,inset). The SEK1 assay represented in the insetof Fig. 2 B had extremely low background. Consequently, the fold stimulation of SEK1 activation is much greater than indicated by the other kinase assays shown. Nevertheless, when we plotted the SEK1 assay and JNK assay on the same graph, using different yaxes, the time courses of SEK1 and JNK activation appeared to be parallel. SEK1 activation was detected at the 1-min time point (17 ± 2.7 fold over background) and increased slowly through 4 min. JNK activation was first detected at the 3-min time point (1.6 ± 0.2 fold over background) and increased slightly by 4 min. Both SEK1 and JNK activity increased dramatically after 4 min. In both COS7 and HeLa cells, JNK and SEK1 activity remained elevated through 60 min of palytoxin treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). Results from Western blot analysis using the phospho-SEK1-specific antibody corresponded to the results from the transient expression assay (Fig.2 C). We detected a faint band (P-SEK1) within 5 min of palytoxin treatment of HeLa cells. The intensity of this band increased dramatically within 10 min of palytoxin treatment and was sustained through 60 min of treatment. The kinetics of palytoxin-stimulated JNK and SEK1 activation are consistent with a role for SEK1 in the regulation of JNK by palytoxin. The time course of palytoxin-stimulated SEK1 and JNK activation in COS7 cells appeared to lag behind that of HeLa cells (compare Fig. 2,A and B). For example, kinase activity appeared to plateau later in COS7 cells than in HeLa cells. A likely explanation for the more rapid response observed in HeLa cells is that this cell line is more sensitive to palytoxin than COS7 cells. We have shown previously that the time course of palytoxin action is dose-dependent (23Wattenberg E.V. Fujiki H. Rosner M.R. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4618-4622PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the greater the dose of palytoxin, the more rapidly the response is detected and the more rapidly the response reaches a maximal point. HeLa cells may be more sensitive to palytoxin than COS7 cells because of a difference in affinity for palytoxin binding or a difference in concentration of effectors that are important for palytoxin action. We used a coupled kinase assay to confirm that palytoxin-activated SEK1 can activate JNK (Fig.3). The coupled kinase assay involves reconstituting the SEK1/JNK/c-Jun pathway in vitro. Transiently expressed GST-SEK1 was isolated from control cells (Fig. 3,odd lanes) or palytoxin-treated COS7 cells (Fig. 3,even lanes). The GST-SEK1 was then incubated with a recombinant JNK fusion protein, GST-JNK, in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The GST-SEK1 isolated from palytoxin-treated cells phosphorylated GST-JNK to a far greater extent than the GST-SEK1 isolated from control cells (Fig. 3, comparelanes 1 and 2), indicating that palytoxin stimulates SEK1 activation. Palytoxin did not appear to stimulate the autophosphorylation of SEK1 (lanes 4 and 10). Although autophosphorylation of SEK1 has been reported (15Sánchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), we and others do not detect it (22Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12969-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This may be because of differences in assay conditions or specific SEK1 activators. Lanes 7 and8 show that palytoxin-stimulated SEK1 can both phosphorylate and activate JNK. When GST-SEK1, isolated as described above, was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of both GST-JNK and GST-c-Jun, phosphorylation of GST-JNK and GST-c-Jun was far greater in the mixture containing GST-SEK1 isolated from palytoxin-treated cells than GST-SEK1 isolated from control cells (Fig.3, compare lanes 7 and 8). GST alone did not stimulate the phosphorylation and activation of GST-JNK (lanes 5 and 6). When GST-JNK was omitted from the mixture, no phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun was detected (Fig. 3, lanes 9and 10), indicating that SEK1 does not directly phosphorylate GST-c-Jun. Altogether, these data indicate that palytoxin stimulates the activation of SEK1, which phosphorylates and activates JNK, which in turn phosphorylates c-Jun. Results from complementary experiments that involved transient expression of a dominant negative mutant of SEK1 support the conclusion that palytoxin can activate JNK through a protein kinase cascade that requires activation of SEK1 (Fig.4). SEK1(K-R) is a kinase-inactive form of SEK1, in which Lys-129 in the ATP binding site of the kinase has been changed to an arginine (15Sánchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). SEK1(K-R) presumably blocks SEK1 activation by sequestering cellular components that interact with this kinase (15Sánchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Palytoxin stimulated the activation of transiently expressed hemagglutinin-tagged JNK (HA-JNK) in COS7 cells, as did anisomycin (Fig. 4 A). Coexpression of SEK1(K-R) effectively blocked activation of HA-"

In insect cells, the interaction between Glu160–Lys176 domains occurs independently of intact heparin or FGF binding domains. The sequence is not required for the binding of heparin or FGF-1, but is essential for mitogenic activity of the FGFR kinase in mammalian cells. The results support a model in which the homeo-interaction between Glu160–Lys176 in the ectodomain contributes to the interaction between intracellular domains in mammalian cell membranes (Kan, M., Wang, F., Kan, M., To, B., Gabriel, J.

We propose that the Glu160–Lys176 domain plays a pivotal role in restriction of the interaction between kinases by pericellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycan and divalent cations.

It derepresses the access of substrates to the catalytic site of the tyrosine kinase, and creates binding sites containing phosphotyrosine for recruitment of substrates that relay signals to the intracellular compartment (1Shi E.

Recombinant FGFR kinases without the ectodomain exhibit autophosphorylation activity of which a part is assumed to occur by an intermolecular mechanism. However, the intracellular kinase domain with or without the COOH-terminal tail sequence does not exhibit sufficient mutual affinity to demonstrate oligomers in solution (2Mohammadi M. Dikic I.

The FGFR kinase with an intact ectodomain exhibits an intrinsic ability to self-associate (1Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Hou J. McBride G. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 1: 3907-3918Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In cell membranes where concentration and mobility are restricted, primary control of the proximity and the activity of the intracellular FGFR kinase domains occurs by the interaction of the extracellular domains with heparan sulfate and FGF. Recently, we proposed a model in which interaction between kinase domains is restricted by conformation due to interaction of Ig loop II with divalent cations and heparan sulfate (5Kan M. Wang F. Kan M. To B. Gabriel J.L. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26143-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This model predicts an interface in the FGFR ectodomain whose interaction is modified by occupation of each FGFR monomer by an FGF and contributes to the relationship between intracellular kinase domains in a physiological context. In this report, using deletion and site-directed mutagenesis and analysis of the self-association of recombinant FGFR ectodomains co-expressed in insect cells, we localize the interaction domain of FGFR to the sequence 160ERSPHRPILQAGLPANK176(Glu160–Lys176). This domain lies between Ig loop II and loop III and by homology to other Ig motifs extends into the NH2 terminus of loop III. In addition to constituting a homeo-interaction domain between FGFR monomers, the sequence likely plays a role in maintenance of the structural relationship between Ig loops II and III and may contribute to the high affinity binding of some members of the FGF family. Heterozygous mutations of the counterpart residues to Arg161 or Ser162 to cysteines in FGFR3 result in disulfide links between receptors and cause the neonatal lethality and profound dwarfism associated with thanatophoric dysplasia (6Tavormina P.L.

Mutations at the counterpart of Ser162 to tryptophan in the FGFR2 gene and Pro163 to arginine in the FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 genes cause less severe abnormalities (8Bellus G.A. Gaudenz K. Zackai E.H.

Both types of mutations are thought to induce FGF-independent FGFR activity presumably by subversion of restrictions on dimerization andtrans-activation of FGFR kinases.

The 5′-noncoding sequence was removed from the FGFR3 cDNA by treatment with BssHI and Klenow enzyme followed by treatment with BclI. The cDNA fragment was ligated at the BclI site with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment coding for the COOH-terminal of FGFR3 generated with sense primer R31 and antisense primer R32 using the FGFR3 cDNA as the template. The resultant full-length coding sequence of FGFR3 containing short non-coding sequences was cloned into pBlueScript SK vector atSmaI and EcoRI sites. The human FGFR4 cDNA beginning 42 bp upstream of the translation initiation site and ending 123 bp downstream of the end of coding sequence of the transmembrane domain was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR from human hepatoma HepG2 cells using sense primer R41 and antisense primer R42. Coding sequence for the intracellular domain of FGFR4 was generated from the same cDNA pool by the sense primer R43 beginning 15 bp upstream of the coding sequence of the transmembrane domain and an antisense primer R44 ending 18 bp downstream of the translation stop codon. The PCR fragment coding for the ectodomain was treated with EcoRI and cloned into pBlueScript SK at an EcoRI site. The PCR fragment coding for the intracellular domain was digested withEcoRI and XhoI. The two cDNAs were fragmented and ligated at the AccI site to yield the full-length coding sequence.

After treatment with KpnI and BamHI, the GST coding sequence was ligated in frame with partial cDNAs coding for wild type or mutant FGFR1β cDNAs at the KpnI site and the constructs were cloned into pBlueScript SK vector at XbaI and BamHI sites. The cDNAs coding for mutants or fragments of the FGFR1 ectodomain were constructed by PCR-mediated mutagenesis as described previously (13Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Shi E. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L.

After digestion with EcoRI and PstI, the above cDNAs were cloned into yeast two-hybrid expression vectors pGBT9 and pGAD424, respectively, atEcoRI and PstI sites to result in the Gal4BD-IL and Gal4AD-IL constructions (Fig. 1). The complete sequence of mutant cDNA fragments generated by the PCR and the sequence across ligation sites with flanking wild type FGFR cDNA sequence was determined. After verifying the sequence, all the cDNA constructions were excised by treatment with BamHI and cloned into baculoviral transfer vector pVL1393 or pcDNAzeo 3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Recombinant baculoviruses were prepared for expression in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells as described (1Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Hou J. McBride G. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell.

Each recombinant viral stock was standardized by analysis of level of expression of antigen determined by immunoblot. The rabbit anti-FGFR2 serum was raised against the FGFR2αIIIc ectodomain expressed in bacteria (16Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropoulos S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell.

FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-7 were iodinated, reactivated by reduction and purified to a specific activity of 2–5 × 105 cpm/ng and analysis of binding and covalent affinity cross-linking of 125I-FGF was performed as described (5, 14, 15, 18, 19). Binding mixtures contained 2 ng/ml radiolabeled FGF and 2 μg/ml heparin. Prior to analysis of ligand-labeled receptors by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (14Wang F. Kan M.

Levels of receptor antigen present in binding assays were standardized by the immunoassays described below. Sf9 cells in six-well plates (9.6 cm2) were infected or co-infected with the combinations of recombinant virus bearing FGFR cDNAs indicated in the text. After three days at 27 °C and removal of the culture medium, the infected Sf9 cells were incubated in the indicated conditions for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, collected by centrifugation and then lysed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.25% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1 mm p-methylsulfonylfluoride. Samples (250 μl) of lysate that were immobilized and purified through a GST component were incubated with 15 μl of GSH conjugated to Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) for 30 min at room temperature. After four washes with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS followed by a wash with 5 mmHEPES-OH buffer (pH 8.0), the specifically bound FGFR complexes were eluted from the beads with 10 mm of GSH in 5 mmHEPES-OH buffer and the eluates were analyzed by immunoblotting. For samples immobilized and purified by antibodies, 250 μl of each lysate was incubated with 2 μg of purified monoclonal antibody or 5 μl of anti-FGFR serum and 15 μl of protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After the beads were washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS four times, the bound FGFR complexes were extracted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblot with appropriate antibodies as described above. Antibodies and immunoblot procedures have been described in detail elsewhere (20Xu J. Nakahara M. Crabb J.W. Shi E. Matuo Y. Fraser M. Kan M. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol.

HF7c strain yeast cells were co-transfected with expression vectors indicated in the text according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The yeast cells were then cultured in agar plates containing SD synthetic medium (−Trp, −Leu) for 4–6 days. Positive colonies were transferred to filter paper and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The filter was then placed on another paper soaked with Z buffer (0.15m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgSO4) containing 0.3 mm X-Gal substrate (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) for β-galactosidase for detection of positive blue colonies that exhibited β-galactosidase activity. BaF3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium and l-glutamine (24Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA-Zeo3.1 plasmid bearing an FGFR1 cDNA indicated in the text by electroporation (960 μF, 220 V) as described (24Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The cells were then distributed to 96-well plates and transfectants selected in the presence of 100 μg/ml Zeocin. Transfected cells exhibiting 5000–20000 receptors/cell were selected by screening in binding assays for radiolabeled FGF-1 and analyzed in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation assays. BaF3 and transfected stock cultures to be used in proliferation assays were washed three times with RPMI 1640 containing 5% FBS. Cells (2 × 104/well) were plated in 96-well plates in 100 μl of RPMI 1640, 5% FBS, and 25 μg/ml heparin. The indicated levels of FGF-1 were added and the total volume adjusted to 200 μl. After 36 h, 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added in a volume of 50 μl of RPMI 1640 medium. After 6 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested with a Packard cell harvester and incorporated thymidine was determined in a TopCount microscintillation plate counter (Packard, Meriden, CT). Specific binding of 125I-FGF-1 (2 ng/ml) was performed on 2 × 106 cells in 0.5 ml of binding buffer containing 2 μg/ml heparin as described above. Previously we demonstrated that FGFR1β1 3FGFR1α and FGFR1β are natural variants that differ by presence and absence, respectively, of an alternately spliced NH2-terminal Ig module. interacts with FGFR1α2 in insect cells co-infected with the two constructs with sufficient affinity to survive detergent-extraction and co-precipitation with an FGFR1α-specific antibody (1Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Hou J. McBride G. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 1: 3907-3918Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). FGFR does not interact under the same conditions with a variety of components at high concentrations in the analytical system including serum proteins, immunoglobulins, recombinant fusion partners, host cell proteins and co-expressed members of other transmembrane receptor families (1Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Hou J. McBride G. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 1: 3907-3918Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar,12Matsuzaki K. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 32: 345-360Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar).2 This suggested the presence of an interaction domain in FGFR1α2 which is missing most of the catalytic domain of the tyrosine kinase and the COOH terminus. The co-precipitation of FGFR1α1 or FGFR1β1 with a chimeric construct comprised of the ectodomain, the transmembrane domain and six amino acid residues of the intracellular juxtamembrane sequence fused to GST (FGFR1βGST) showed that an interactive domain was upstream of most of the FGFR intracellular domain (Figs. 1 and2 A). Heparin and FGF increased the interaction of FGFR1β1 with FGFR1α2 in the membranes of insect cells when both were expressed at low levels at a ratio of about 1 to 1 (1Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Hou J. McBride G. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 1: 3907-3918Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, a significant portion of the two isoforms of FGFR interacted independent of heparin and FGF at the lowest level of expression that could still be accurately measured (1Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Hou J. McBride G. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 1: 3907-3918Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). When either FGFR1α1 or FGFR1β1 were co-expressed at a high level and at a ratio of approximately 2 to 1 to FGFR1βGST (Fig.2 A), no effect of added heparin and FGF on the amount of either isoform that co-precipitated with FGFR1βGST could be demonstrated (Fig. 2 B). Scanning densitometry indicated that less than 10% of FGFR1α1 and 35% of FGFR1β1 complexed with FGFR1βGST under the conditions. FGFR2α1, FGFR3α1, and FGFR4α1 also complexed with the FGFR1βGST product under the same conditions (Fig. 3). These results show that in the absence of restrictions imposed by concentration or other factors in mammalian cells, a domain resides in the FGFR1βGST product that interacts with another FGFR independent of heparin and FGF. The domain required for the interaction is potentially conserved among the four FGFR genes (Fig. 1 B). The ectodomain of FGFR exhibits a characteristic sequence domain called the acidic box. It is located at the NH2 terminus of FGFRβ and constitutes the inter-loop sequence between loops I and II in FGFRα. It is not essential for the binding of heparin/heparan sulfate or FGF (10Hou J.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10231-10235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although the acidic box is alternately spliced in FGFR2β (15Wang F. Kan M. Yan G. Xu J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10231-10235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Miki T. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), it is always present in the FGFRα isoform (15Wang F. Kan M. Yan G. Xu J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10231-10235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Loop II of FGFR contains an essential heparan sulfate-binding domain in its NH2 terminus. The domain together with the connecting sequence between Ig loops II and III and a segment of the NH2 terminus of loop III constitutes a common high affinity binding site for FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-7, and possibly all members of the FGF family of polypeptides (13Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Shi E. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar,14Wang F. Kan M. Xu J. Yan G. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10222-10230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine whether the acidic box or loop II were involved in the interaction between FGFR ectodomains, we deleted the acidic box and loop II from the FGFR1α ectodomain. This resulted in a construct composed of loop I, the inter-loop sequence that normally connects loops II and III and loop III (FGFR1αΔII) plus the transmembrane domain and 17 residues of the intracellular juxtamembrane (Fig.1 A). A similar construction (FGFR1αΔIIAH) was also built in which the acidic box and the heparin-binding domain were present at the NH2 terminus of loop I (Fig. 1 A). Both constructs missing the entire Ig loop II module were unable to bind FGF (Fig. 1 B), but retained the ability to interact with intact FGFR1α1 (Fig. 4) and FGFR1β1 (data not shown). Unless a separate interaction domain lies within Ig loop I of the FGFRα isoform, these results suggested that an FGFR interaction domain resides between the COOH terminus of loop II and the COOH terminus of the transmembrane domain. To further confirm the absence of an interaction domain within the acidic box and loop II, we prepared a construct of FGFR1βGST from which loop III and the inter-loop II-III sequence between Val159 and Thr268 was deleted (FGFR1βΔIIIGST). The association of FGFR1β1 with the construct after purification on GSH-beads was markedly reduced relative to FGFR1βGST (Fig. 5, top panel). However, the FGFR1βΔIIIGST product composed of the acidic box, loop II, the extracellular juxtamembrane and transmembrane domains of FGFR retained high affinity for heparin (Fig.6 A) and FGF-1 (Fig.6 B). The binding of FGF-2 to the construction was reduced, but still detectable under the same conditions. No binding of FGF-7 could be detected under the same conditions. However, specific binding of FGF-7 to the FGFR1βΔIIIGST product was observed when radiolabeled FGF-7 was increased 10-fold in binding assays and exposure of autoradiographs was prolonged (Fig. 6 B).

Our data suggest that the nucleotide at the 5th position appears to be responsible for the 3–5-fold preference for wild type U3 ends over wild type U5 ends by integrase for concerted integration. Additional mutations at the 5th or 6th position, or both, of U3 or U5 termini significantly increased (∼3 fold) the full-site reactions of mutant donors over wild type donors.

Upon retrovirus infection, the viral RNA genome is reverse transcribed into a linear blunt ended DNA genome. The retrovirus U3 and U5 DNA termini contain LTR 1The abbreviations used are: LTR, long terminal repeat; AMV, avian myeloblastosis virus; bp, base pair(s); RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; PrA, Prague A strain; wt, wild type; kbp, kilobase pair(s). sequences with short imperfect inverted repeats located at the very end of the blunt ended LTRs (1Varmus H.E. Shapiro J.A. Mobile Genetic Elements. Academic Press, New York1983: 411-503Google Scholar). In vivo, the inverted repeats are necessary for virally encoded integrase to catalyze the removal of a dinucleotide from the 3′-OH termini and the subsequent full-site integration reaction (2Goff S.P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 527-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The full-site reaction involves the concerted insertion of the two recessed LTR DNA termini into the host genome. This reaction also results in the formation of a small size host duplication at the site of insertion whose size is virus-specific (1Varmus H.E. Shapiro J.A. Mobile Genetic Elements. Academic Press, New York1983: 411-503Google Scholar). In vitro, the mechanisms involved in the recognition of the blunt ended LTR termini by integrase for the 3′-OH processing reaction and for half-site strand transfer of the recessed LTR termini into target DNA have been investigated (2Goff S.P.

These in vitro analyses using purified integrase from several retrovirus species have established that the imperfect inverted repeat sequences located at the LTR termini are also necessary for catalysis (1Varmus H.E.

Besides the essential CA dinucleotide located 2 nucleotides downstream from the blunt ended viral termini, approximately 5–10 nucleotides internally also play varying roles in the 3′-OH processing and half-site strand transfer reactions (2Goff S.P.

Study of the specific interactions of integrase with the U3 and U5 LTR termini for the full-site integration reaction in vitro would provide insights into the in vivointegration reaction.

Three nonsymmetrical nucleotides are at the 5th, 8th, and 12th positions of the 15-bp inverted repeats located at the RSV LTR termini. It is unknown what role the three nonsymmetrical nucleotides have in modifying the recognition of integrase for either LTR terminus or their influence on the full-site integration reaction. In this report we examined the role of the three nonsymmetrical nucleotides located in the avian U3 and U5 15-bp inverted repeat and several other LTR mutations in the formation of donor-target recombinants that are produced by the full-site integration reaction. The full-site reactions were catalyzed by either AMV integrase derived from virions or by recombinant RSV PrA integrase purified from bacteria. Of the seven LTR mutations examined, some had either a significant gain or a loss of function for the full-site reaction, whereas others had no affect. The interactions of integrase with wt and mutant LTR DNA termini for full-site strand transfer were evaluated byBglII digestion of labeled donor-target recombinants resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequence analysis of donor-target junctions. The specific activities of both virion and recombinant integrase appear equivalent when catalyzing the half-site and full-site strand transfer reactions with either wt or mutant LTR DNA substrates, or the 3′-OH processing reaction with similar blunt ended substrates. The wt and mutant LTR donor substrates were produced by cloning 60-bp double-stranded oligonucleotides containing terminal U3 and U5 LTR sequences into the NdeI site of pUC19 plasmids lacking a HindIII site (Fig. 1,top). The U3 and U5 ends were separated by aHindIII site. A genetic selection marker, thesupF gene (420 bp), was cloned into the HindIII site of each plasmid. The clones were sequenced to verify the constructs. All plasmids were purified by velocity sedimentation before digestion with either NdeI or both NdeI andHinfI to isolate the appropriate LTR donor fragments. The donor fragments were isolated by either agarose or by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All donor substrates contained the uniqueBglII site adjacent to the U3 LTR terminus (Fig. 1,bottom). With this same structural arrangement, all of the donor-target recombinants would give the same restriction pattern. The target DNA was supercoiled pGEM, which lacked a BglII site. The 5′-end labeling ofNdeI-digested DNA fragments was performed by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (15Vora A.C. McCord M. Fitzgerald M.L. Inman R.B. Grandgenett D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We routinely labeled sets of wt and mutant donor substrates at the same time to produce labeled molecules that had very similar specific activities, usually at 2,000 cpm/ng of DNA. This labeling strategy allowed us to determine directly by PhosphorImager analysis the amount of input donor DNA which was used for strand transfer within each set of wt and mutant donor reactions. The 3′-OH labeling of the NdeI sites on the 480-bp donors was accomplished by using Klenow polymerase with [α-32P]TTP and unlabeled deoxynucleotides (19Fitzgerald M.L. Vora A.C. Grandgenett D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The fill-in reactions were always greater than 98% as verified by restriction enzyme cleavage of the labeled molecules and by subsequent examination of the labeled strand on DNA sequencing gels. After labeling, the donors were digested with HinfI producing two fragments of 248 bp (U5 end) and 198 bp (U3 end) in size. TheHinfI sites were filled in with unlabeled deoxynucleotides. Scale-up reactions (40×) were performed for sequencing of donor-target recombinants. After isolation of the 3.3-kbp donor-target recombinants by BglII restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis, the ligated DNAs were transformed into CA244 cells (15Vora A.C. McCord M. Fitzgerald M.L. Inman R.B. Grandgenett D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Colonies were screened for plasmids that were analyzed by size, restriction enzyme digestion, and dideoxy DNA sequencing to determine the size of the host site duplications. Standard reaction mixtures (20 μl) for full-site strand transfer contained 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 8% polyethylene glycol 6000, 15% dioxane, and 330 mm NaCl (14Vora A.C. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7483-7488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, AMV or RSV integrase (50 nm) was first preincubated on ice for 10 min in the above assay mixture with 15 ng of donor DNA. The strand transfer reactions were initiated by the addition of target (100 ng) and immediate incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. The molar ratio of dimeric integrase to donor ends was 12:1, respectively. The reactions were stopped, and the DNA products were separated on agarose gels (15Vora A.C. McCord M. Fitzgerald M.L. Inman R.B. Grandgenett D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The amount of products produced was determined by a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The standard 3′-OH processing reaction conditions were 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 140 mm NaCl, and 20 mm MgCl2 (19Fitzgerald M.L. Vora A.C. Grandgenett D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). AMV and RSV integrase was at either 10 or 20 nm. Integrase:blunt ended donor substrates ratios used for the 3′-OH processing reaction were similar to those described for strand transfer. AMV (21Grandgenett D.P. Vora A.C. Schiff R. Virology. 1978; 89: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and RSV integrase (data not shown) were purified to near homogeneity. RSV integrase was cloned from an infectious PrA viral DNA clone (22Mumm S.R. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed in bacteria using a pET11 vector. The purification procedure and the physical characterization of RSV integrase will be published separately. The protein concentrations of each purified integrase preparation were determined by A 280 measurements. In this report we examined the contribution of the three nonsymmetrical nucleotides that map to the 5th, 8th, and 12th positions of the RSV U3 and U5 LTR DNA termini for the full-site integration reaction (Fig. 1). The mutations were introduced onto the 3′-OH processing strand and are numbered with respect to the blunt ended terminus. The U3 nonsymmetrical nucleotides were modified singly to U5 sequences, and the U5 nonsymmetrical nucleotides were modified singly to U3 sequences; in each case, the other two nonsymmetrical nucleotides were unchanged. Several other gain or loss of function mutations in the LTR termini were also examined. In all cases, a wt LTR terminus was present on the opposite end of each LTR mutant donor substrate. The full-site and half-site strand transfer reactions using the 480-bp wt U3/U5, wt U3/U3, and three mutant LTR donor substrates (Fig. 1) with AMV integrase at 50 nm are shown in Fig. 2 A. The wt U3/U5 and wt U3/U3 donors served as control substrates for measuring catalytic rates and for determining how the different wt LTR termini affect the full-site reaction. In a 10-min reaction at 37 °C, the total incorporation of each input donor into the pGEM target was 10.8, 15, 3.7, 10.8, and 16.3% for wt U3/U5, wt U3/U3, U3P5-A/T, U3P8-A/G, and U5P5,6-TT/AA, respectively (Fig. 3,bottom line). As determined by PhosphorImager analysis, the above reactions were linear for at least 20 min, and in most cases, half or more of the DNA products were full-site recombinants. With the same labeled LTR donors, purified RSV integrase at 50 nmincorporated 9.4, 14.3, 1.8, 8, and 22% of the input substrates, respectively, into the pGEM target (Fig. 2 B). With either integrase, fewer than 1% of the input donors were integrated into themselves as donor-donor recombinants. This is the first report of a recombinant integrase protein that has a specific activity similar to that of the virion-purified protein for catalyzing the full-site reaction using wt and mutant donor substrates. It should be noted that concentrations of AMV integrase greater than ∼125 nm (14Vora A.C. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7483-7488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or RSV integrase greater than ∼60 nm (data not shown) in the standard reaction for full-site integration initiate inhibition of catalysis.Figure 3Quantitative analysis of BglII restriction products of donor-target recombinants produced by AMV integrase. For easier visualization and understanding of the tabulated data in this figure, please see the BglII digestion data in Fig. 4 A. The total amounts of donor-target recombinants produced by AMV integrase with wt U3/U5, wt U3/U3, U3P5-A/T, U3P8-A/G, and U5P5,6-TT/AA donors (Fig. 2 A) are shown on the bottom line as a percent of donor substrate inserted into pGEM. The vertical columns in thebox were identified with each of the above donors. Schematics for the BglII digestion products are shown in theleft margin. The BglII digestion of one donor molecule inserted into pGEM produces either “A” or “B” type structures depending on whether the U5 or U3 end was integrated, respectively. BglII digestion of the linear 3.8-kbp donor-target recombinant produces four linear restriction fragments with the two 3.3-kbp U3/U5 fragments comigrating. Using PhosphorImager data, the percentage of each digested product produced was determined relative to the total donor-target products produced by that donor (Fig. 4 A). The BglII 3.7-kbp U5/U5 product (middle of first vertical column of numbers) obtained using wt U3/U5 donor was set to equal 1. The other numbers were derived by dividing the percentage of homologous U5/U5 full-site product of the wt donor into the percentage of each product obtained with a specific donor. For example, the numbers in the first column (wt U3/U5 donor) are very similar to the numbers in thefourth column (U3P8-A/G donor) because this mutation did not modify significantly the half-site and full-site reactions catalyzed by integrase. For visualization of the above comparison, comparelanes 2 and 8 of Fig. 4 A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Modification of the 5th nucleotide (A to T) on the U3 LTR terminus (U3P5-A/T donor) decreased the ability of both AMV integrase and RSV integrase to catalyze the full-site and half-site reactions to one-third or less of that obtained with the wt U3/U5 donor (Fig. 2,A and B, lanes 2 and 6; Fig. 3). Modification of the nonsymmetrical 8th nucleotide of U3 from A to G (U3P8-A/G donor) did not modify the ability of either integrase to catalyze stand transfer compared with the wt U3/U5 donor (Fig. 2,A and B, lanes 2 and 8). A gain of function mutation in the U5 LTR, the U5P5,6-TT/AA donor relative to the wt U3/U5 donor, is shown in Fig. 2, A andB, lanes 2 and 10; and Fig. 3. The double mutation produces a U3 LTR sequence up to the 5th nucleotide with one additional nucleotide change upstream. Analysis of the data shows that the 5th and 6th nucleotides that are critical for half-site strand transfer also significantly influence the full-site reactionin vitro. We investigated if the individual mutations that were introduced into the recessed U3 and U5 LTR termini modified their interactions with other wt LTR termini or with themselves for full-site strand transfer and, simultaneously, for the half-site reaction. To investigate these interactions, the wt and mutant donor-target recombinants (Fig. 2, A andB) were subjected to BglII restriction analysis (AMV reactions, Fig. 4 A; RSV reactions, Fig. 4 B). It was established previously thatBglII digestion of half-site and full-site donor-target recombinants gives specific cleavage patterns (14Vora A.C. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7483-7488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vora A.C. McCord M. Fitzgerald M.L. Inman R.B. Grandgenett D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 3. The quantity of each uncleaved and cleaved donor-target recombinant was determined by PhosphorImager analysis. For comparison among all donor-target recombinants, the full-site 3.7-kbp homologous U5/U5 recombinant obtained by BglII digestion of the wt U3/U5 donor (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) for AMV integrase was arbitrarily set to 1 (Fig. 3), in relationship to the other digested donor-target recombinants obtained with the other donor substrates. The full-site U5/U5 recombinants were produced at the lowest level for any of the wt full-site recombinants. Similar quantitative data (data not shown) were obtained as shown in Fig. 3with the RSV integrase reactions with the same donor substrates (Fig.4 B). A control strand transfer reaction was analyzed first with the wt U3/U5 donor substrate (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 1 and 2; Fig. 3). With this donor, the recessed U3 LTR terminus was approximately 3-fold more effective than the recessed U5 LTR terminus for the half-site reaction (see column of wt U3/U5 donor in Fig. 3 and the column of BglII-digested products in Fig.4, A or B, lane 2). TheBglII-digested half-site donor-target recombinants were classified as “A” and “B” type structures that were produced by the use of either the U5 or U3 LTR terminus, respectively (Fig. 3). For the full-site reactions, the 2.9-kbp homologous U3/U3 recombinants were ∼5-fold higher than the 3.7-kbp homologous U5/U5 recombinants whose quantity was set to 1. The full-site 3.3-kbp U3/U5 recombinants were ∼3.6-fold higher than the U5/U5 recombinants. The data suggest that integrase recognizes and subsequently uses the U3 terminus at a significantly higher level than the U5 LTR terminus when the LTRs are presented at an equal molar ratio in the reaction mixture. The BglII digestion of control wt U3/U3 donor reactions (Fig. 3, second column; Fig. 4, A andB, lane 4) demonstrated that the “A” and “B” half-site reactions were nearly equal, suggesting that sequences outside the 25-bp LTR region appeared not to influence strand transfer significantly. All full-site reactions with this donor would be homologous U3/U3 reactions only. The full-site 3.7-kbp and 2.9-kbp U3/U3 recombinants were nearly equal but were half the amount of the full-site 3.3-kbp U3/U3 recombinants. The individual wt U3/U3 donors can be inserted into pGEM in two orientations giving rise to the same size 3.3-kbp BglII restriction fragment. We cannot rule out the possibility of a minor negative effect exerted by the proximity ofsupF sequences located at the BglII side of the wt U3/U3 donor. The effect is seen when comparing the “B” with “A” half-site products or the full-site 2.9 kbp with 3.7 U3/U3 recombinants (Fig. 3, second column). The two control reactions above demonstrate that BglII restriction analysis of the donor-target recombinants provides a quantitative and convenient method of simultaneously analyzing half-site and full-site integration reactions. Because the U3 terminus is identical to the U5 terminus in sequence except for the nonsymmetrical nucleotides, the ability of integrase to recognize and to use recessed U3 over U5 LTR ends would be related to these nucleotides. We next examined how the individual nucleotide changes in the U3 LTR terminus modified the ability of integrase to catalyze both half-site reactions and full-site reactions with its own mutated U3 terminus and with wt U5 LTR ends. With the mutant U3P5-A/T donor and AMV integrase at 50 nm (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and 6), the overall strand transfer products were decreased to one-third the level observed with the wt U3/U5 donor (Fig.3). Increasing the concentration of AMV integrase to 88 or 120 nm did not increase the efficiency of catalysis of donor U3P5-A/T nor change its BglII restriction pattern relative to the wt U3/U5 donor (data not shown). The BglII digestion pattern observed with the mutant donor U3P5-A/T was changed significantly relative to the wt U3/U5 donor (Fig.4 A, lanes 2 and 6). The most striking observation is that the U3P5-A/T LTR end appears to have activity similar to the wt U5 LTR end located on the same donor molecule. Almost all of the catalytic reactions with the U3P5-A/T donor more closely parallel wt U5 LTR than wt U3 LTR activities (Fig. 3, firstand third columns). In addition, the half-site B U3P5-A/T LTR reaction of donor U3P5-A/T was inhibited 60% compared with the U3 LTR of wt donor U3/U5. The full-site 3.3-kbp U3/U5 and the 2.9-kbp homologous U3/U3 recombinant reactions of donor U3P5-A/T were decreased 50 and 85%, respectively, compared with the same wt U3/U5 donor reactions. Similar results were obtained with the BglII digestion patterns using donor U3P5-A/T with RSV integrase at 50 nm (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). With either AMV or RSV integrase (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 2 and 8), changing the 8th nucleotide of the U3 LTR from A to G (donor U3P8-A/G) (Fig. 3, fourth column) had no apparent affect on the strand transfer reactions compared with the wt U3/U5 donor. The 12th nonsymmetrical nucleotide in the U3 inverted repeat was not examined, although a single nucleotide deletion 2 bp downstream of the 8th nucleotide decreases half-site and full-site catalytic rates (see below). The data suggest that the nonsymmetrical nucleotide at the 5th position has a significant effect on the preferential recognition of U3 ends over U5 ends by integrase as well as on subsequent catalysis. The wt U5 end of donor U3P5-A/T was able to relieve some of the inhibitory effects of the single nucleotide change in the U3P5-A/T terminus. This conclusion was reached if one compares the ratio of the full-site U3/U5 (3.3 kbp) to homologous U3/U3 (2.9 kbp) reactions observed (0.66) with the wt U3/U5 donor (Fig. 3, first column) to the ratio observed (2.2) with the full-site 3.3-kbp to 2.9-kbp reactions of donor U3P5-A/T (Fig. 3, third column). We next examined the effects of three U5 mutations individually directed against the nonsymmetrical nucleotides on the strand transfer reactions. We compared the wt U3/U5 donor with donors containing single mutations in U5 at the 5th, 8th, and 12th positions (U5P5-T/A, U5P8-G/A, U5P12-G/T, respectively) using both AMV integrase (Fig.5 A) and RSV integrase (Fig.5 B). To determine if sequences downstream of the 8th nonsymmetrical nucleotide of U3 were important, we also investigated whether a single nucleotide deletion (A at position 10) in the U3 LTR of donor U5P8-G/A had an effect on catalysis. For a 10-min reaction at 37 °C, AMV and RSV integrase at 50 nm incorporated 10.6, 12.6, 6, and 12% and 10.6, 12.8, 8.4, and 14% of the above donors into pGEM, respectively. As shown previously, fewer than 1% of the donors were integrated into themselves, and greater than 50% of the donor-target recombinants were full-site products (Fig. 5 and data not shown). The BglII digestion fragments observed in Fig. 5 with the U5 LTR mutations were subjected to PhosphorImager analysis as described in Fig. 3 (data not shown). The data demonstrated that the wt U3/U5 donor reactions with AMV integrase (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1and 2) and RSV integrase (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and 2) were essentially identical to those observed in Fig. 4 and as calculated in Fig. 3. Several changes in the half-site and full-site reactions were evident with the above set of U5 LTR mutations. As expected, the modification of the U5 LTR sequence to a U3 LTR sequence (T to A at the 5th position; donor U5P5-T/A) up-regulated the ability of both integrase proteins to use the mutated U5 terminus, which is now similar to the wt U3 terminus. For example, the half-site (“A”) product and the full-site 3.7-kbp recombinants using the mutated U5 terminus of donor U5P5-T/A (Fig. 5, A orB, lane 4) were significantly higher (2–3-fold) than the same size products using the U5 end of the wt U3/U5 donor, shown in lane 2 of panels A and B. Similarly, the half-site wt U3 product (“B”) of donor U5P5-T/A is nearly the same quantity as the half-site product (“A”) with the mutated U5 terminus of the same donor (Fig. 5, A andB, lane 4). In lane 4 of both integrase sets, the mutated U5 end interactions with the wt U3 end to produce the full-site 3.3-kbp recombinants were similar in quantity to the full-site 2.9-kbp homologous U3/U3 product obtained with the wt U3/U5 donor shown in lane 2. The changing of the 8th (donor U5P8-G/A) or 12th (donor U5P12-G/T) position of the U5 LTR to U3 sequences (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 6and 8, respectively) had little effect on the mutated U5 LTR strand transfer reactions compared with reactions observed with the U5 LTR of the wt U3/U5 donor (lane 2). The modification of the U3 LTR by a single nucleotide deletion at the 10th position of donor U5P8-G/A had a modest effect on the overall catalytic rates (comparelanes 5 and 6 of 5A and 5Bwith t"

One attractive hypothesis, based on data from progesterone receptors, is that agonistversus antagonist binding induces unique conformations at the C terminus of receptors, which can be detected by the different fragments produced by partial proteolysis. We now report that the determinants of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-antagonist complex activity are more complex. Steroid binding did cause a conformational change in the GR that was detected by partial trypsin digestion, as described previously (Simons, S. S., Jr., Sistare, F. D., and Chakraborti, P. K. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14493–14497). However, there was no uniformity in the digestion patterns of unactivated or activated receptors bound by a series of six structurally different antagonists including the affinity labeling antiglucocorticoid dexamethasone 21-mesylate. A total of four resistant bands were observed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels in the range of 30–27 kDa. Using a series of point mutations and epitope-specific antibodies, it was determined that the 30-kDa species represented the entire C-terminal sequence of amino acids 518–795, whereas the other bands arose from additional N-terminal and/or C-terminal cleavages. Bioassays with GRs containing various point and deletion mutations failed to reveal any C-terminal alterations that could convert antagonists into biologically active agonists. Thus, the presence or absence of C-terminal amino acids of the GR did not uniquely determine either the appearance of smaller trypsin-resistant fragments or the nature of the biological response of receptor-bound antisteroids. When compared with the current model of the ligand-binding domain, which is based on the x-ray structures of the comparable region of thyroid and retinoic acid receptors, the present results suggest that sequences outside of the model structure are relevant for the binding and biological activity of GRs.

Ligand binding to the cognate intracellular receptor is the obligate first step by which steroid hormones in the circulatory system regulate gene transcription in selected cells of mammals. In general, the steroid receptors contain two transactivation domains, AF-1 and AF-2, in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal portions of the molecule, respectively (1Bocquel M.T. Kumar V. Stricker C.

This ability of antisteroids to block the action of agonist steroids makes them useful both as probes of the mechanism of steroid hormone action and as drugs.

Despite the differences in the final biological response, the initial steps for most agonist and antagonist steroids are identical. The high affinity binding site in the LBD appears to be the same for both classes of steroid, as indicated by the affinity labeling of the same amino acid of the human estrogen receptor by an estrogen agonist (ketononestrol aziridine) and antagonist (tamoxifen aziridine) (13Harlow K.W. Smith D.N. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Greene G.L. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17476-17485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both classes of steroid can cause release of hsp90 after steroid binding that is accompanied by the acquisition of high affinity DNA binding (Refs. 5Miller P.A. Ostrowski M.C. Hager G.L. Simons Jr., S.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6883-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and 6DeLabre K. Guiochon-Mantel A. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Perhaps most revealing is that virtually all antagonists have been observed to exhibit partial agonist activity under some condition. The fact that even the “best” antagonists for glucocorticoid (15Simons Jr., S.S. Yen P.M. Spelsberg T.C. Kumar R. Steroid Sterol Hormone Action. M. Nijhoff, Boston, MA1987: 251-268Google Scholar, 16Hoeck W. Rusconi S. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14396-14402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Guido E.C. Delorme E.O. Clemm D.L.

Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) receptors can be made to display significant amounts of agonist activity suggests that the differences between agonist and antagonist complexes are quantitative rather than qualitative. Thus, receptors complexed with either agonists or antagonists share at least a portion of the various components required for transcriptional activation. While the distinction in biological activity between agonist and antagonist steroids may not be absolute, there usually are major differences in the amount of activity that need to be explained. Clearly, the structure of each steroid is of primary importance. Often changes in just the substituents of the basic steroid structure are sufficient to convert an agonist into an antagonist. However, the same substituent may not be equally effective within each group of agonists (22Lamontagne N. Mercier L. Pons M. Thompson E.B. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 2252-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, structure-activity relationships have yet to provide a satisfactory framework for predicting the properties of a given steroid. For this reason, attention has shifted from differences in the structure of the steroid to possible modifications in receptor conformation following steroid binding. The most commonly used method for detecting conformational changes has been site-selective proteolysis. This method was first used to study the tertiary structure of the DNA- and non-DNA-binding forms of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) (23Reichman M.E. Foster C.M. Eisen L.P. Eisen H.J. Torain B.F. Simons Jr., S.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5376-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and then to establish a conformational change in GRs following steroid binding (24Simons Jr., S.S. Sistare F.D. Chakraborti P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14493-14497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies employed affinity labeling to identify the various receptor fragments. Since then, the utility of the method has been greatly expanded both by the availability of anti-receptor antibodies and by the use of in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled receptors in the elegant studies of O'Malley and co-workers (25Allan G.F. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Beekman J.M. Allan G.F. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J.

Biol. 1993; 46: 643-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, protease digestion studies have confirmed that steroid binding induces conformational changes in all of the members of the steroid receptor superfamily that have been examined (reviewed in Ref. 4Simons Jr., S.S. The Molecular Biology of Steroid and Nuclear Hormone Receptors.in: Freedman L.P. Birkhaeuser Boston, Inc., Boston1997Google Scholar). Even more tantalizing were the observations that antisteroids appeared to place the receptor in a conformation that rendered the carboxyl-terminal tail of the protein more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage (25Allan G.F. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the same time, studies with the long form of the human progesterone receptor (B form) indicated that deletion of the last 42 amino acids, which were required for the binding of progesterone but not the antiprogestin RU 486, permitted RU 486 to act as an agonist (28Vegeto E. Allan G.F. Schrader W.T. Tsai M.-J. McDonnell D.P. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Apparently similar phenomena for other receptors and additional confirmatory data have subsequently appeared (25Allan G.F. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

Thus, it has been proposed that the transcriptional inactivation by antisteroids is controlled by a steroid-induced conformational change in the C terminus of the LBD that can be detected by differential proteolysis of the individual receptor-steroid complexes (25Allan G.F.

The purpose of this study was to address several major unanswered questions concerning the importance of the C-terminal sequences of the GR LBD in the expression of antiglucocorticoid activity. Thus, we wanted to know whether steroid-induced conformational changes in the GR were specific for agonist versus antagonist steroids and where precisely in the receptor LBD the steroid-induced conformational changes occurred. To answer these questions, we have used trypsin to probe rat GRs bound by a variety of steroids. The receptor fragments were identified with affinity labeling and/or anti-receptor antibodies. Receptor mutations were used to confirm various assignments. Unless otherwise indicated, all operations were performed at 0 °C. [1,2,4-3H]Dexamethasone was purchased from Amersham Corp. [6,7-3H]Dexamethasone 21-mesylate (DM), R5020, and Enlightning were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. TAPS, dextran, and lysyl endopeptidase C were purchased from Calbiochem. Hydrofluor was from National Diagnostics, Inc. (Atlanta, GA). Tween, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, and SDS were purchased from Bio-Rad. Deacylcortivazol, RU 486, and ZK 98,299 were gifts from Roussel-UCLAF (Romainville, France), Etienne Baulieu (INSERM U33 and Collège de France, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, Paris), and David Henderson (Schering AG, Berlin), respectively. Dexamethasone oxetanone (41Pons M. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Org. Chem. 1981; 46: 3262-3264Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and DM (42Simons Jr., S.S. Pons M. Johnson D.F. J. Org.

All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma, includingN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone-treated chymotrypsin andl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin. The polyclonal antibody aP1, which was raised against the carboxyl-terminal region of the rGR (amino acids 440–795) (16Hoeck W. Rusconi S. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14396-14402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. Bernd Groner (Friedrich Miescher-Institut, Basel, Switzerland), and the antibody hGRα, which was raised against the C-terminal 19 amino acids of human (and rat or mouse) GR (43de Castro M. Elliot S. Kino T. Bamberger C. Karl M. Webster E. Chrousos G.P. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 597-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. George Chrousos (NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The anti-GR-(788–795) antibody (44Flach H. Kaiser U. Westphal H.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Heinrich Westphal (University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany). TAPS buffer (25 mm TAPS, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) was adjusted to pH 8.8 or 9.5 at 0 °C with NaOH. Tris-buffered saline (TBS) contained 20 mm Tris and 0.28 m NaCl (pH 7.5). The 2 × SDS sample buffer contained 0.6 m Tris (pH 8.85), 0.2m dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and bromphenol blue. The Western blot transfer buffer was composed of 25 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The K536A mutant GR was prepared using the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis kit (Amersham Corp.) by annealing a synthetic oligonucleotide, with the underlined base changes to create the desired mutant (5′-AAAATCCTAACGCAACAATAGTTCCTG-3′), to the full-length single-stranded GR cloned in the pTZ18U plasmid (45Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11366-11373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the annealed oligonucleotide was extended and ligated using Klenow polymerase and T4 DNA ligase, the remaining single-stranded template was removed with T5 exonuclease. The non-mutant strand was then nicked with NciI and digested with exonuclease III. Repolymerization with DNA polymerase I and T4 DNA ligase resulted in a double-stranded homoduplex. After transformation into MV1190 cells, colonies were picked and screened for the desired mutation by DNA sequencing using Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The CS1, CD, and CS1/CD mutant GRs were gifts from Dr. Sandro Rusconi (University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland). HTC Spinner cultures were grown in Swim's S77 medium supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum, 5% fetal calf serum, and 0.03% glutamine (46Mercier L. Thompson E.B. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The calcium phosphate-mediated transient transfection of wild-type (pSVL-GR) or mutant receptors into monolayer cultures of COS-7 cells was conducted as described previously (45Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11366-11373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HTC cell cytosol containing steroid-free receptors was prepared as reported (23Reichman M.E. Foster C.M. Eisen L.P. Eisen H.J. Torain B.F. Simons Jr., S.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5376-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Transfected COS-7 cell cytosol was made by resuspending the frozen cell pellet in TAPS buffer (pH 9.5), slowly thawing the pellet on ice, followed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g. The supernatant was used as cytosol. For purified receptors, HTC cell cytosol was first covalently labeled by incubation with [3H]DM for 2.5 h at 0 °C. A 6-ml aliquot of labeled cytosol was loaded onto a PD10 column packed with 3.7 ml of DNA-cellulose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that had been equilibrated with TAPS buffer (pH 8.8) containing 50 mmNaCl. The column was washed with 30 ml of the same buffer, and the receptor was eluted in 0.4-ml fractions with TAPS buffer (pH 8.8) containing 500 mm NaCl. The peak fractions of radioactivity were stored at −80 °C until needed (47Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9669-9675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Scatchard analysis, duplicate aliquots of HTC cell or transiently transfected COS-7 cell cytosol were incubated in TAPS buffer (pH 8.8) plus 20 mm sodium molybdate with 0.625–50 nm [3H]dexamethasone ± a 500-fold excess of unlabeled dexamethasone for 24 h at 0–4 °C. Free steroid was removed by adding an aliquot of 10% dextran-coated charcoal solution. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the nonspecific binding seen in the presence of unlabeled dexamethasone from the total binding. The affinity (K d) was determined by plotting the ratio of bound steroid/free steroidversus bound steroid. Proteolytic digestion was performed with HTC or transfected COS-7 cell cytosol that had been incubated with ethanol or 1 μmsteroid for 2.5 h at 0–4 °C. Only unactivated receptor solutions contained 20 mm sodium molybdate. Receptor-steroid complexes were activated by heating at 20 °C for 30 min. Affinity-labeled receptors were prepared by incubating cytosol with 150 nm [3H]DM ± a 100-fold excess of unlabeled dexamethasone for 2.5 h at 0–4 °C (48Simons Jr., S.S. Miller P.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6876-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The proteolytic fragments were generated by incubation of steroid-bound receptors with 15–300 μg/ml trypsin for 1 h at 0 °C. A 10-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor or aprotinin was then added to prevent further proteolysis, and the samples were quick-frozen at −80 °C. Samples were diluted 1:2 in 2 × SDS sample buffer, heated for 5 min in a boiling water bath, and analyzed on 12% polyacrylamide gels run in a water-cooled (15 °C) Bio-Rad Protean II slab gel apparatus. Gels were fixed and stained in a solution of 50% methanol, 7.5% acetic acid, and 0.01% Coomassie Blue R-250 for 30 min at room temperature. The gels were destained overnight in a solution of 10% methanol and 7.5% acetic acid and then incubated with constant shaking in Enlightning for 1 h, followed by a 10% polyethylene glycol 8000 solution for 30 min at room temperature. The gels were dried on a Bio-Rad Model 443 slab gel drier at 80 °C for 2 h and exposed to Kodak X-Omat XAR-5 film at −80 °C for at least 2 weeks after marking the positions of the molecular mass markers (Pharmacia) with a fluorescent paint. Samples were diluted with 2 × SDS sample buffer and analyzed on polyacrylamide gels as described above. The gels were equilibrated in transfer buffer for 30 min at room temperature prior to electrophoretic transfer of receptor to nitrocellulose membranes in a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus (100 mA overnight followed by 250 mA for 2 h). The nitrocellulose was stained in Ponceau S (0.02% Ponceau S and 0.04% glacial acetic acid in water) to localize molecular mass markers, incubated with 10% Carnation nonfat dry milk in TBS for 45 min, and washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween (0.1TTBS) for 5 min. Primary antibody was diluted in 0.1TTBS (1:20,000 for aP1, 1:5000 for hGRα, or 1:5 for anti-GR-(788–795)) and added to the nitrocellulose for a 2-h incubation at room temperature. Biotinylated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (for the antibody provided by Dr. Heinrich Westphal) secondary antibody and ABC reagents (each diluted 1:1000; Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) were each added for sequential 30-min incubations at room temperature. After the incubation periods with primary antibody, secondary antibody, and ABC reagents, the nitrocellulose was washed three times for 5 min each with 0.1TTBS and an additional three washes with TBS containing 0.3% Tween immediately after incubation with the ABC reagents. Detection of signal was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence using the recommended protocol of the supplier (Amersham Corp.). The positions of the molecular mass markers were indicated by overlaying with a fluorescent paint marker. A total of six antiglucocorticoids and two glucocorticoids (22Lamontagne N. Mercier L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30576-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) of relatively different structures were selected (Fig.1). HTC cell receptors were prebound by each steroid in the presence of 20 mm sodium molybdate to afford unactivated complexes that do not bind DNA. A series of fragments in the range of 30–27 kDa were visualized by Western blotting after digestion with chymotrypsin and trypsin (Fig.2) or lysyl endopeptidase C (data not shown). With all three proteases, one or more intense bands at ≤29 kDa were seen for receptors prebound by RU 486 as opposed to dexamethasone. The smaller band(s) was also seen with ZK 98,299 but not with any other antiglucocorticoid examined (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Thus, a unique digestion pattern with lysyl endopeptidase C, chymotrypsin, or trypsin appears to be a function of receptors bound by steroids containing a bulky 11β-substituent (Fig. 1) as opposed to diagnostic property of unactivated GRs bound by antiglucocorticoids in general. Furthermore, receptors bound by the most potent agonist, deacylcortivazol (52Simons Jr., S.S. Thompson E.B. Johnson D.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 793-800Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), gave the same lower band after lysyl endopeptidase C digestion as seen for RU 486 (data not shown). Therefore, no obvious correlation with steroid activity existed among the digestion patterns of unactivated receptor-steroid complexes for any of the three proteases.Figure 2Digestion of unactivated complexes with chymotrypsin or trypsin. Aliquots of HTC cell cytosol (30% in TAPS buffer (final pH ≈8.8 at 0 °C) with 20 mm sodium molybdate) with 1 μm steroid (except for 1.5 × 10−7m DM ± 150 × 10−7m dexamethasone) were incubated at 0 °C, digested with the indicated amounts of chymotrypsin or trypsin, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide (9%) gels, Western-blotted with aP1 anti-GR antibody, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence as described under “Materials and Methods.” The numberson the left indicate the molecular masses (in kilodaltons) of the standard proteins, which were located by overlays of spots of fluorescent paint. The arrows correspond to the positions of the four major species between 30 and 27 kDa.

We have employed a yeast cell-free system to examine the biochemical mechanism of the BER pathway in lower eukaryotes. Using uracil-containing DNA as a model substrate, we demonstrate that yeast BER requires Apn1 protein, an Escherichia coli endonuclease IV homolog. In extracts of an apn1 deletion mutant, the 5′-incision at AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) sites is not detectable, supporting the notion that yeast contains only one major 5′-AP endonuclease. The processing of the 5′-deoxyribose phosphate moieties was found to be a rate-limiting step. During BER of uracil-containing DNA, repair patch sizes of 1–5 nucleotides were detected, with single nucleotide repair patches predominant."

Enhancer sequences represent the ultimate target of signal transduction pathways that lead to induction of specific sets of genes. Although transcription can be activated by a large variety of stimuli and despite the presence in many enhancers of the same or of similar protein-binding motifs, only a subset of genes is switched on in response to a specific signal, implying that very fine mechanisms regulate the specificity of enhancer function. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) 1The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; COM, cooperation mediator; uCOM, 5′-half of COM; dCOM, 3′-half of COM; UEF, urokinase enhancer factor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is a serine protease important in fibrinolysis and cell recruitment and hence in a variety of processes requiring cell migration, e.g. inflammation and cancer (1De Cesare D.

In culture, induction or modulation of uPA synthesis was first observed with phorbol ester PMA (6Wigler M. Weinstein I.B. Nature. 1976; 259: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and then reproduced in many cell lines with a large number of growth factors, hormones, and differentiation factors (7Besser D. Verde P. Nagamine Y. Blasi F. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 215-237Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the embryo, uPA is expressed constitutively in the extraembryonic trophoblast (8Sappino A.-P. Huarte J. Belin D. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2471-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9Teesalu T. Blasi F. Talarico D. Mech. Dev. 1996; 56: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and in the adult in the kidney, lung, and scattered fibroblastic cells (10Larsson L.I. Skriver L. Nielsen L.S. Gr⊘ndahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Dan⊘ K. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 894-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking regulatory region of the human uPA gene has been studied in some detail. The promoter shows the presence of a typical TATA-box, is rich in Sp1 sites, and is strongly activated by an enhancer located about 2,000 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site (11Verde P. Boast S. Franze' A.M. Robbiati F. Blasi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10699-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The minimal uPA enhancer region contains an upstream combined PEA3/AP-1A (octameric) site and a downstream heptameric AP-1B site (see Fig. 1). All three such sites are important for induction of uPA gene transcription by a variety of extracellular stimuli such as PMA, epidermal growth factor, okadaic acid, and cytoskeleton disruption; the inactivation of only one of the three sites results in the loss of enhancer function (12Lee J.S. von der Ahe D. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Caracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P.

Johnsen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5009-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Synergism between PEA3/AP-1A and AP-1B depends on the integrity of the 74-base pair region, called COM (cooperation mediator), that separates these sites (13Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Caracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4573-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Synergism requires a series of protein-binding sites, clustered in a specific bipartite uCOM-dCOM arrangement (Fig. 1) (1De Cesare D. Palazzolo M. Blasi F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2551-2562PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Caracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P.

In fact, even in the presence of intact PEA3/AP-1A and AP-1B elements, disruption of all COM protein-binding sites leads to inactivation of the enhancer function (13Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Caracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4573-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, COM has no direct transactivation function, and its mechanism of action is still mostly unknown. It has been shown that uCOM and dCOM each contributes about 50% of the activity of the whole region and that COM action is position-dependent but orientation-independent (1De Cesare D. Palazzolo M. Blasi F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2551-2562PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, when the 17-base pair uCOM-DNA is incubated with a HeLa nuclear extract, four DNA-protein complexes (urokinase enhancer factors; UEFs) are formed, UEF-1, UEF-2/3, and UEF-4 (13Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Caracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4573-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The binding site for UEF-2/3 has been identified (16Berthelsen J. Vandekerkhove J. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3822-3830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and its sequence is shown in Fig.1. The dCOM region binds two factors that have not yet been analyzed. Sequences homologous to the uPA COM regions are present and shown to be active also in promoters other than uPA, like interleukin-3, LD78, stromelysin, and other AP-1-regulated genes (16Berthelsen J.

Moreover, purified UEF-2/3 has been shown to bind not only to the uPA uCOM but also to the homologous region of the interleukin-3 promoter (16Berthelsen J. Vandekerkhove J. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3822-3830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As a further step in characterizing the COM region and the COM-binding factors, we have identified the UEF-4-binding site, studied its function in the uPA enhancer, and purified UEF-4. The results show that the UEF-4 site is very similar to a negative regulatory region in the AP-1-dependent LD78/MIP-1α chemokine, a PMA-regulated gene, and is conserved in the regulatory regions of a variety of other genes. Moreover, the UEF-4 and the UEF-1 plus UEF-2/3 sites are all necessary for enhancer activity and can substitute for each other. Finally, we have purified UEF-4 protein and begun its characterization. The purified factor binds both the uPA UEF-4 and the LD78/MIP-1α sequences and is made up of 105- and 60-kDa polypeptides, the former endowed with DNA binding activity. HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Approximately 1–2 × 106 cells were electroporated with 3 μg of the reporter DNA construct plus 27 μg of carrier Bluescript plasmid (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and 0.5 μg of CMVβ-GAL plasmid as internal control, for a total of 30.5 μg of DNA. Cells were electroporated in 0.5 ml of complete medium, 250 V and 960 microfarads, using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). Cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and allowed to attach overnight. For PMA induction, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and 100 ng ml−1PMA. Control cells received equivalent amounts of Me2SO, the solvent for PMA. Cell extracts were divided in two aliquots, of which one was analyzed by a β-galactosidase assay (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The remaining aliquot was heated at 65 °C and assayed for CAT activity by diffusion of reaction products into scintillation fluid (22Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-446Google Scholar). Preparation of HeLa cell nuclear extracts was carried out according to Ref. 23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9168) Google Scholar, with minor modifications (16Berthelsen J. Vandekerkhove J. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3822-3830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The NaCl concentration of samples resuspended in buffer C was adjusted to 0.4m with 5 m NaCl. The protease inhibitor aprotinin (1 mg ml−1) was added to buffers C and D. The protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay. 32P-Labeled oligonucleotides (T4-polynucleotide ligase) were used as probes. Gel retardation reactions were carried out in a 20-μl volume containing 20,000–30,000 cpm probe and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). Nuclear extracts were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol with poly(dI-dC) and competitor DNA as indicated for 10 min at 20 °C. For EMSA analysis of the UEF-4 purified protein 50 μg of bovine serum albumin and 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC) were used in binding reactions. Probe was added, and the incubation continued for 10 min. Samples were then run on 5% native polyacrylamide gels (30:1 in 0.25 × TBE; 1 × TBE: 89 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, and 1 mmEDTA). Cross-linking analysis was carried out as described before (24Hansen S.K. Nerlov C. Zabel U. Verde P. Johnsen M. Baeuerle P.A. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). EMSA reactions were scaled up by increasing 5-fold the amount of nuclear extract and bromodeoxyuridine-substituted probes used in binding reactions, and the reaction products were separated as described above. The wet gel was UV-irradiated at 364 nm for 30 min and autoradiographed at 4 °C. The bands corresponding to DNA-protein complexes were cut out and equilibrated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50 mm DTT, and 2% SDS before loading on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Molecular weight markers were obtained from Amersham Corp. Methylation interference with DMS was performed essentially as described (25Siebenlist U. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), with minor modifications, under experimental conditions that preferentially reveal contacts at sequences containing G residues in the major groove of the DNA double helix. Briefly, either the top or bottom strand of o-17Δ2 oligonucleotide was labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase and then annealed with the unlabeled complementary strands. Probes were methylated by dimethyl sulfate, used in combination with nuclear extracts in 5-fold scaled-up binding reactions, and DNA-protein complexes were separated on native gel electrophoresis (see above). Bands corresponding to free and retarded probe were cut out. The DNA was recovered by electroelution, phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and subjected to piperidine cleavage. The products were analyzed by 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 8 m urea. DNA manipulations were carried out by standard techniques (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and plasmid structures were verified by DNA sequencing. All constructs were generated by cloning polymerase chain reaction-produced fragments into pBLCAT2 (26Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) previously cut by SalI andBamHI. Specific point mutations were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using primers that introduced the desired mutation. Following, the template and the oligonucleotide used as direct primer in polymerase chain reaction for each construct are shown (the mutated nucleotides are indicated in boldface lowercase letters). The reverse primer was the same for all constructs: 5′-TGGGCGGGCCGGATCCTCT-3′. The −1977/−1858 fragment was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the plasmid containing the whole uPA promoter (−2345/+30) (13Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Caracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4573-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) by using specific primers (27De Cesare D. Vallone D. Caracciolo A. Sassone-Corsi P. Nerlov C. Verde P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 365-376PubMed Google Scholar). The WTCAT template was used for constructing DCAT. The direct primer was 5′-CAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGAAATGAAGTCATCTGCTCTCAGCAATCAGCtTcACAGCCTCCAGC-3′. In this case, the template was the plasmid FIEuPA (13Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Caracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4573-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), with the same primers used for the WTCAT. The template was the plasmid EuPA (13Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Caracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4573-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), with the same primers used for the WTCAT. This plasmid was used as a template for constructing DECAT, and the direct primer was the same as for the DCAT plasmid (Ref. 8Sappino A.-P. Huarte J. Belin D. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2471-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The template was the plasmid WTCAT, and the direct primer was CAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGAAATGAAGTCATCTGCTCTCAGCAATCAGCATGACCCTCCAGC. The template was the plasmid Δ2CAT, and the direct primer was CAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGAAATGAAGTCATCTGCTCTCAGCAATCAGCTTCACCCTCCAGC). The template was ECAT (see above); the direct primer was the same as for Δ2DCAT (see above). The template was WTCAT2, and the direct primer was CAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGAAATGAAGTCATCTGCTCTCAGCAATCATCATGACAG. The DCAT plasmid has been previously described (1De Cesare D. Palazzolo M. Blasi F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2551-2562PubMed Google Scholar). For purification of UEF-4, nuclear extracts (319 mg of total proteins) in buffer C (23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9168) Google Scholar) were subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation at 55% saturation. The precipitate was resuspended in one-quarter of the original volume of TK100 buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 200 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Na2S2O5, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and dialyzed against the same buffer. The material was loaded on a Q-Sepharose HP column (55 ml, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which was washed with the same buffer. The flow-through, containing 95% of UEF-4 binding activity and only 18% of the total protein (5-fold purification) was dialyzed against H2K150 buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 200 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmNa2S2O5, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and fractionated through heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (HiLoad 26/10 column, 40 ml, Pharmacia). The column was washed with H2K150 buffer and eluted with 90 ml of a 150–660 mm KCl gradient in H2 buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 200 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Na2S2O5, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Fractions with the highest UEF-4 activity (screened by EMSA) were pooled and dialyzed against H2K150. The pool was passed over a column containing the mutated UEF-4-binding site DNA (o-17Δ2D; see Table I for sequence) to eliminate nonspecific DNA-binding proteins; the column was prepared by coupling a streptavidin-agarose resin (3.2 ml, Pierce) to the 5′-biotinylated (top strand) double-stranded o-17Δ2D oligonucleotide. The flow-through, containing 96–98% of the loaded UEF-4 activity, was finally passed over a o-17Δ2-streptavidin-agarose column. The o-17Δ2-streptavidin-agarose column was prepared by coupling 1.6 ml of streptavidin-agarose to the biotinylated o-17Δ2 oligonucleotide (UEF-4-binding site). The column was washed with H2K150 buffer and eluted with 15 ml of a 200–575 mm KCl gradient in H2 buffer. Fractions were screened by EMSA and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by silver staining. Samples for electrophoresis (1 μl) were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue), heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and resolved on 10–15% gradient gels by using the Phast System (Pharmacia). Pharmacia low molecular weight markers were used as protein standards.Table ISequence of oligonucleotidesCAGCAATCAGCATGACAGCCTCCAGCo-17wt (uCOM)TGCTCTCAGCAATCAGCtTcACAGCCTCCAGCo-17DTGCTCTCAGCAATCAGCtTGACAGCCTCCAGCo-17D1TGCTCTCAGCAATCAGCATcACAGCCTCCAGCo-17D2TGCTCTCAGCAATCAGCAgGACAGCCTCCAGCo-17KCAGCAATCAGCATGACA-CCTCCAGCo-17Δ1CAGCAATCAGCATGAC--CCTCCAGCo-17Δ2CAGCAATCAGCtTcAC--CCTCCAGCo-17Δ2DCAGCAATAAGCATGAC--CCTCCAGCo-17Δ2G1CAGCAATAATCATGAC--CCTCCAGCo-17Δ2G2CAGCAATAAGAATGAC--CCTCCAGCo-17Δ2G3CAGCAATCAGCATGA---CCTCCAGCo-17Δ3CAGCAATCAtCATGA---CCTCCAGCo-17Δ3G2Sequences begin from the 5′ end, and only the coding strand is shown.

Caracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4573-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), of which UEF-2/3 bind specifically the TGACAG sequence (16Berthelsen J. Vandekerkhove J. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3822-3830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A substitution of two nucleotides, one of which lies within the TGACAG sequence (o-17D, TableI), prevents the formation of all four complexes (1De Cesare D. Palazzolo M. Blasi F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2551-2562PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that these factors might bind to overlapping sequences or that the four bands (or some of the bands) represent multimers of the same protein(s). Since we have previously characterized the UEF2/3-binding site (16Berthelsen J. Vandekerkhove J. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3822-3830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we used a UEF-2/3-specific affinity resin (U3BE-agarose, see “Materials and Methods”) to deplete a nuclear extract of this activity and tested the depleted extract for UEF-1 and UEF-4 binding activities. The U3BE resin has been previously shown to purify to homogeneity the UEF2/3 complexes (16Berthelsen J. Vandekerkhove J. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3822-3830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The U3BE-treated extracts were used in EMSA with a labeled uCOM oligomer as a probe (o-17). These extracts showed a specific loss of UEF-2/3, but not of UEF-1 and UEF-4 (Fig. 2). Control DNA affinity resin containing a mutated TGACAG sequence (U3BEmut, see “Materials and Methods”) failed to deprive nuclear extracts of UEF-2/3 factors, demonstrating the specificity of the observed depletion (Fig. 2). We conclude that UEF-1 and UEF-4 binding activities are independent of the presence of UEF-2/3 and hence may be due to different proteins. Moreover, the data of Fig. 2 also indicate that UEF-1 and UEF-4 have a DNA sequence specificity distinct from that of UEF-2/3. To analyze the DNA binding specificity of UEF-4, oligomers with a mutated uCOM were employed as competitors in binding assays. We began the analysis by deleting one, two, and three nucleotides, respectively, at the 3′-end of the TGACAG consensus in the o-17 (uCOM) sequence, generating the o-17Δ1, o-17Δ2, and o-17Δ3 oligonucleotides (see Table I for sequences). As shown in Fig. 3 A, the o-17Δ1 oligonucleotide competed as efficiently as the wild type o-17 for the formation of all UEF complexes. However, mutation o-17Δ2, while still able to compete for UEF-4, no longer competed for UEF-1 and UEF-2/3. On the other hand, o-17Δ3 competed for UEF-1 and UEF-4, but no longer for UEF-2/3. Oligonucleotide o-17D, shown for comparison, was unable to compete for any of the complexes. These results were confirmed by direct binding studies; labeled o-17Δ2 oligonucleotide gave rise to a single retarded complex, which co-migrated with the UEF-4 complex (Fig. 3, B). This band was competed for by unlabeled wild type o-17 oligonucleotide to the same extent as the UEF-4 complex formed by the wild type o-17 probe. Thus, the complex formed by o-17Δ2 behaved like UEF-4 not only in electrophoretic mobility but also in binding specificity. Labeled o-17Δ3 oligonucleotide gave rise to two retarded complexes exhibiting the same relative mobility and the same binding specificity of UEF-1 and UEF-4 (data not shown). To better define the UEF-4-binding sequence, we used methylation interference analysis with o-17Δ2, which only binds UEF-4 with the same affinity of o-17 (see Fig. 3 B). Partially dimethyl sulfate-modified o-17Δ2 probes, labeled on either strand, were used in scaled-up binding reactions. Fig. 4shows a representative experiment. In the UEF-4-bound DNA, two G residues on the bottom strand and one on the top strand became totally unreactive to piperidine treatment (filled circles). In addition, a weak protection was observed on one G residue on the top strand (open circle). These data indicate that UEF-4 binds DNA mostly outside of the UEF-2/3-binding site but that one weak contact also occurs with the first guanine of the TGACAG sequence. Thus, the UEF-2/3-binding site appears to partially overlap with the UEF-4-binding site. To support these findings, the three G residues totally protected in the methylation interference assay in the o-17Δ2 oligonucleotide were individually mutated to T residues. The ability of the unlabeled mutated o-17Δ2G1, -G2, and -G3 oligonucleotides to compete for UEF-4 formation was tested by EMSA (data not presented) and showed that o-17Δ2G1, o-17Δ2G2, and o-17Δ2G3 (see Table I for sequences) were significantly less effective than the o-17Δ2 oligomer in inhibiting UEF-4 complex formation, confirming the results obtained by methylation interference analysis. As a negative control, mutation D was inserted in the context of the o-17Δ2 sequence (o-17Δ2D; see Table I). Densitometric quantitation of the data indicated that an at least 4-fold higher concentration of mutated oligomers was needed to achieve 50% inhibition with respect to o-17Δ2 (Fig.5). Taken together, the results of Figs. 4 and 5 strongly support the conclusion that the G residues, whose methylation prevented binding, were involved in contacts between DNA and UEF-4. However, the methylation interference analysis was carried out in a mutated context of the uCOM region, the o-17Δ2 sequence, which is only permissive for the binding of UEF-4. Therefore, mutation G2 was introduced in the o-17 wild type sequence. The mutated uCOM oligomer (o-17G2, Table I) was assayed both in binding and in competition studies. As shown in Fig.6 A, when o-17G2 was used as a competitor with o-17 and o-17Δ2 probes, it uniquely failed to compete for the formation of UEF-4 complex. When used as a probe, the o-17G2 mutation still bound UEF-1 and UEF-2/3, but not UEF-4. In addition, labeled o-17G2 was incapable to form a UEF-4 complex with HeLa nuclear proteins, while normally forming the other complexes (Fig.6 B); in this experiment, the different intensity of the UEF bands shifted by the wild type and the o-17G2 oligonucleotides was due to different specific activities of the probes and not to weaker affinity. When G1 and G3 mutations were inserted into the o-17 wild type sequence, similar results were obtained (data not shown). We conclude that the three G residues identified by methylation interference do not significantly interact with UEF factors other than UEF-4. Thus, the sequence CAGC, immediately 5′ of TGACAG, is specific for UEF-4 and has no overlap with other UEF-binding sites. To define the 5′-boundary of the UEF-4 site, we constructed 5′-deleted oligonucleotides and tested their binding and competing activity. As shown in Fig. 7 (A andB), the shortened oligonucleotides U4a and U4b bound to and competed with UEF-4 as efficiently as the o-17Δ2 sequence. On the other hand, U4c and U4d showed a reduced or an absent UEF-4 binding activity, respectively, setting a 5′-limit for the UEF-4-binding site (5′-AATC …). The presence of a weak protected G residue in methylation interference suggests that the binding sites for UEF-2/3 and UEF-4 overlap. In fact, substitution of A and G in the CATGAC sequence of o-17 (oligonucleotide o-17D) also destroys UEF-4 binding (see above). To obtain a better refinement of the 3′-border, we individually mutated the TGA nucleotides in the o-17 sequence, and tested their binding ability. As shown in Fig. 7 C, mutations D1 (A to T) and K (T to G) destroyed UEF-4 binding activity, while mutation D2 (G to C) had a weak effect only. On the other hand, all three mutations interfered with the binding of UEF-1, and mutation D2 also interfered with the binding of UEF2/3. These data extend the 3′-border of the UEF-4 site to at least the T of the TGACAG sequence and show that the binding sites for all factors indeed overlap within the ATGA sequence. Thus, the sequence 5′-AATCAGCAT(G)-3′ is the binding site for UEF-4. Having identified"
