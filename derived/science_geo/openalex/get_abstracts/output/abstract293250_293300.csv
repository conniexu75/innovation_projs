https://openalex.org/W2026656003,"At maturity, female baboons in the Amboseli National Park of Kenya generally attain a rank position among adults near to that of their mothers. However, the age of a female's mother and the difference in ages between sisters also influence the rank acquisition process. These latter demographic variables, which are sensitive to changes in resource availability, may account for the close association both within and among primate species of specific patterns of rank organization and specific environmental conditions."

If they found food on it they returned to it readily the next day; whoever had led in eating usually did so again. If they did not find food, day 2 responsiveness decreased. These untrained performances were sufficient for one-trial visual discrimination learning."
https://openalex.org/W2069547789,"Recent theoretical predictions indicate that melting of a two-dimensional solid may be caused by spontaneous creation of dislocations. The theory predicts that melting occurs by a two-step process involving an intermediate phase, called the hexatic phase, in which there is order in the local crystalline axes but not in the positions of atoms. These ideas are being tested by numerical simulations and by experiments on electrons on liquid helium, liquid crystal films, and rare gas layers adsorbed on graphite. Experiments on liquid crystal films indicate that the three-dimensional analog of the hexatic phase exists, and xenon on graphite exhibits a melting transition close to the form predicted."

Public Health Service Research Grants program represents a sincere and continuing effort to supply Federal funds for the support of necessary additional research in the fields of medical and related sciences without interposing any degree of government restriction, control, supervision, or regimentation. The program is a scientific one, scientific guidance of which lies wholly in the hands of scientists."

https://openalex.org/W1979095128,"Bischoff and Rosenbauer claim that their uranium series ages for the Del Marman and Sunnyvale skeletons indicate that the previously published aspartic acid racemization ages of these two skeletons are too old. They state that the concordancy of their /sup 230/Th and /sup 231/Pa ages supports the uranium series ages for the bone samples. Uranium series ages, however, are based on the critical assumption that bones incorporate uranium for only a relatively short time after their burial and have subsequently remained closed systems with respect to migration of both uranium and its daughter isotopes /sup 230/Th and /sup 231/Pa. We maintain that the assumption of rapid uranium incorporation followed by closed system behavior is tenuous and that /sup 230/Th-/sup 231/Pa concordancy is a necessary but not sufficient condition to establish this behavior and thus the accuracy of the dates."
https://openalex.org/W1982567093,"The energy trends of the past and their likely evolution in the next 50 years have been analyzed in the light of technological progress. It is concluded that society will tend to become less centralized than in the past and that it is possible to have future per capita values of energy consumption at the world level similar to those at present, with a substantial redistribution to allow for economic growth of the less developed countries. A condition for this is increasing penetration of electricity. The rationale for the suggested scenario is described, and prospects for electricity for both the industrialized and developing countries are discussed."
