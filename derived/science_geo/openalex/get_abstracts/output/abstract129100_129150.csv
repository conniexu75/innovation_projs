https://openalex.org/W1976637929,"Dimerization of G-protein-coupled receptors has been increasingly noted in the regulation of their biological activity. However, its involvement in agonist-induced receptor internalization is not well understood. In this study, we examined the ability of mouse δ-opioid receptors to dimerize and the role of receptor dimerization in agonist-induced internalization. Using differentially (Flag and c-Myc) epitope-tagged receptors we show that δ-opioid receptors exist as dimers. The level of dimerization is agonist dependent. Increasing concentrations of agonists reduce the levels of dimer with a corresponding increase in the levels of monomer. Interestingly, morphine does not affect the levels of either form. It has been shown that morphine, unlike other opioid agonists, does not induce receptor internalization. This suggests a relationship between the ability of agonists to reduce the levels of dimer and to induce receptor internalization. The time course of the agonist-induced decrease of δ-opioid receptor dimers is shorter than the time course of internalization, suggesting that monomerization precedes the agonist-induced internalization of the receptor. Furthermore, we found that a mutant δ-opioid receptor, with a 15-residue C-terminal deletion, does not exhibit dimerization. This mutant receptor has been shown to lack the ability to undergo agonist-induced internalization. These results suggest that the interconversion between the dimeric and monomeric forms plays a role in opioid receptor internalization.

The opioid receptor family, a member of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; DOR, δ-opioid receptor; MDOR, DOR tagged with c-Myc; FDOR, DOR tagged with the Flag epitope; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DSP, dithiobis-(succinimidylpropionate); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DADLE, [d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin; DSLET, [d-Ser2]Leu-enkephalin-Thr; DPDPE, [d-Pen2,Pen5]enkephalin; DAMGO, [d-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin. consists of three receptor types: δ, ॖ, and κ. The opioid receptors transmit the signals induced by binding of opioid peptides and opiate alkaloids, such as morphine. Continuous or repeated exposure to opioid ligands causes decreased sensitivity to the drug and reduced cellular response; this response is regulated by multiple mechanisms. Long-term exposure to opioid ligands causes receptor down-regulation as a result of the receptor degradation (1Law P.-Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol.

Short-term treatment with opioid ligands causes rapid loss of receptors from the surface of the cell as a result of the receptor endocytosis (5Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V.

Although deletion of the C-terminal tail substantially reduces the extent of both down-regulation and rapid internalization, point mutations within this region reduce the extent of internalization without affecting down-regulation, suggesting that these two responses are differentially regulated (7Trapaidze N.

Different opioid ligands induce different effects on rapid internalization of the opioid receptors. Morphine, unlike most of the opioid agonists, does not induce rapid internalization of the opioid receptors (5Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M.

An exact mechanism of the opioid receptor internalization is not known, although it has been suggested that the rapid endocytosis of the receptors is mediated through the classic endocytic pathway (5Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 7Trapaidze N.

Possible events that would precede the receptor internalization, such as the interaction of the receptor with an adapter protein or another receptor, have not yet been determined. A number of pharmacological studies suggest the existence of opioid receptor dimers. Dimeric analogs of morphine and enkephalin exhibit higher affinity for δ- and ॖ-opioid receptors in membranes (9Hazum E. Chang K.-J. Leighton H.J. William Lever O. Cuatrecasas P. Biochem. Bioph. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). They also have severalfold greater potency than their monomeric forms in the guinea pig ileum assay, suggesting the involvement of opioid receptor dimerization in their function. Apart from homodimerization, several pharmacological studies have suggested the existence of heterodimers between opioid receptor subtypes (10Bowen W.D. Gentleman S. Herkenham M. Pert C.B. Proc.

Pharmacol. 1989; 160: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Since ॖ-receptor ligands inhibit the binding of δ-ligands in both a competitive and noncompetitive manner, Rothman et al. (11Rothman R.B. Danks J.A. Jacobson A.E. Burke Jr., T.R. Rice K.C. Tortella F.C. Holaday J.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 124: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,12Rothman R.B. Bykov V.

The dimerization of growth factor receptors has been an extensively studied phenomenon (for review, see Ref. 13Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). Exposure to ligand induces the dimerization of receptors, leading to their autophosphorylation, a step that is necessary for the following intracellular signaling. The dimerization of GPCRs and the role of dimerization in the function of these receptors are not well understood. Most of the evidence suggesting the existence of GPCRs as dimers is from pharmacological studies (14Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Studies with several GPCRs show that the co-expression of two mutant receptors, which individually do not bind or transduce signals, results in receptors that bind and transduce signals (14Kobilka B.K.

A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). These data imply that a functional complementation is achieved by intermolecular interaction between receptor molecules. By cross-linking and immunoprecipitation, Hebert et al. (17Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) have shown that the ॆ2-adrenergic receptor can form homodimers and that a peptide derived from the transmembrane domain VI of the receptor inhibits homodimerization (17Hebert T.E.

The functional importance of dimerization is supported by the observation that this peptide also inhibits ॆ2-adrenergic agonist-promoted stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes (17Hebert T.E.

However, the possible role of dimerization in receptor internalization was not examined in these studies. To date, there is no direct evidence for the existence of opioid receptor dimers or oligomers. In this study, we used cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of the tagged mouse δ-opioid receptor (tagged with either Flag or c-Myc epitope) to examine whether these receptors interact to form dimers. We also examined whether opioid peptides and alkaloid opiate agonists and antagonists affected the levels of receptor dimer. Furthermore, we determined the time course of the agonist-induced changes in the levels of dimer and compared it to the time course of the agonist-induced receptor internalization. Finally, we used a truncated mutant of the δ-opioid receptor to examine the role of the C-terminal tail in dimer formation. We found that δ-opioid receptors exist as dimers. The level of dimerization is agonist dependent, and an intact C-terminal tail of the δ-opioid receptor is required for receptor dimerization. The Flag epitope-tagged DOR was generated as described previously (4Cvejic S. Trapaidze N. Cyr C. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4073-4076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Trapaidze N. Keith D.E. Cvejic S. Evans C.J. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). c-Myc epitope-tagged δ-opioid receptor (DOR) was generated by an overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction, using Flag epitope-tagged DOR cDNA as the template. The sequence encoding for the Flag epitope was replaced with the sequence encoding the c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLLR). The deletion mutant ΔC15 was generated using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify a region from Thr211 to Val357 of Flag epitope-tagged δ-opioid receptor that was subcloned into the pCDNA3 expression vector. Unique restriction enzyme sites were used to replace a corresponding region of the wild type receptor with the polymerase chain reaction amplification product. CHO cells stably expressing Flag epitope-tagged wild type or ΔC15 deletion mutant receptors were generated, and their binding affinities, coupling to adenylyl cyclase, internalization, and down-regulation properties were characterized as described previously (4Cvejic S. Trapaidze N. Cyr C. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4073-4076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Trapaidze N. Keith D.E. Cvejic S. Evans C.J. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For the experiments with immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, CHO or COS cells were transfected with 20 ॖg of c-Myc and/or Flag-tagged DOR using the Ca2+ phosphate method (18Ansubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman G.J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 9.0.1-9.9.6Google Scholar). Cross-linking and immunodetection were performed 48 h later as described below. Cells expressing either wild type or mutant δ-opioid receptor were incubated either with different doses of ligand for 10 or 30 min (see Fig. 2) or with the same dose of the ligand for different time periods (see Fig. 4) in F12 medium at 37 °C. The following ligands were used: [d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE); [d-Ser2]Leu-enkephalin-Thr (DSLET); [d-Pen2,Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE); [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO); etorphine; morphine; and naloxone. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were chilled to 4 °C and incubated without or with cross-linkers in 27 Me2SO in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C; the cells were treated with either 5 mm dithiobis-(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP, Pierce) for 30–60 min, 5 mm(bis-[ॆ-(4-azidosalicylaminido)ethyl]disulfide (Pierce) for 2–15 min, or 5 mm N-5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyloxysuccinimide (Pierce) for 1–3 min. The reaction was terminated by incubation with 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, for 15 min. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 17 Triton X-100, 107 glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2) for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were used for further analysis.Figure 4Time course of agonist-induced changes in the level of δ-opioid receptor dimers. CHO cells expressing δ-opioid receptor were exposed to 100 nm DADLE (A), 100 nm DADLE (B), or 1 ॖm naloxone (B) for the indicated time. Following treatment, cells were chilled, treated with the 5 mm DSP, and lysed. The lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and to Western blotting as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 The positions and molecular masses (in kDa) of prestained standards (Sigma) are indicated on theleft.

The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (MSI Inc.), blocked with 57 milk in washing buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline); 0.057 Tween 20 and 1 mm CaCl2) for 1 h. Membranes were incubated with the M1 anti-Flag antibody (Kodak) (10 ॖg/ml) in Tris-buffered saline, 17 bovine serum albumin, 57 milk, and 1 mm CaCl2 for 1 h and washed with washing buffer four times for 15 min each. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) (0.2 ॖg/ml) in 57 milk in washing buffer for 1 h, the membranes were washed with washing buffer four times for 15 min each. The enhanced chemiluminescence method using the Renaissance kit (NEN Life Science Products) was used as described by the manufacturer to detect the secondary antibody. This procedure resulted in the specific detection of the 60-kDa big Flag epitope-tagged DOR in CHO cells; no signal was observed in cells expressing the untagged δ-opioid receptor. For the detection of c-Myc DOR in COS cells, A14 anti-c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) were used for immunoblotting. Immunoblotting analysis of the proteins from the COS cells expressing either of the two tagged DORs revealed a specific band of approximately 65–70 kDa only in cells transfected with the receptor cDNA. Difference in the size of the receptor expressed in COS cells from the size of the receptor expressed in CHO cells can be attributed to the different extent of glycosylation in these two cell lines. For densitization of the blots, a LaCie Silverscanner attached to a Macintosh Quadra 950 and NIH Image software were used. Typically, two or three exposures of each membranes were scanned, and only the values in linear range of the film were used. For immunoprecipitation, lysates from CHO or COS cells expressing c-Myc DOR and/or Flag-DOR were incubated with the A14 anti-c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz) (1 ॖg/ml) by mixing for 12 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for an additional 2 h. The immunoprecipitation complex was isolated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min, and the pellet was washed twice with the lysis buffer. The pellet was resuspended in reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with M1 anti-Flag antibody. The receptor was detected as described above using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and chemiluminescence method. To study whether the δ-opioid receptors form dimers, we used CHO cells stably expressing the Flag epitope-tagged δ-opioid receptor. We have shown previously that the receptors expressed in these cells bind opioids with high affinity and efficiently couple to adenylyl cyclase (4Cvejic S. Trapaidze N. Cyr C. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4073-4076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Trapaidze N. Keith D.E. Cvejic S. Evans C.J. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates with the M1 anti-Flag antibody revealed a predominant protein of about 60 kDa (Fig.1 A, −, −). The size of this protein corresponds to the size previously described for δ-opioid receptor (19Evans C.J. Keith D.E. Morrison H. Magendzo K. Edwards R.H. Science. 1992; 258: 1952-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 20Kieffer B.L. Befort K. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Hirth C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12048-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also observed an additional band of about 120 kDa (Fig. 1 A, −, −). The fact that this higher molecular mass protein is immunoreactive to the M1 antibody suggested that it represents the δ-opioid receptor interacting with another protein. When cell lysates were made in the presence of higher concentrations of SDS (boiling in 27 SDS) only the 60-kDa protein could be detected (not shown). This suggested that the 120-kDa protein was formed by a noncovalent interaction of two 60-kDa proteins and that this interaction was sensitive to the presence of detergents. To examine the state of the receptor prior to solubilization, a representative of events at the cell surface, we carried out covalent cross-linking of native proteins present in intact cells. We used DSP, a homobifunctional cross-linker that conjugates proteins through their primary amines or the ε-amine of lysine. DSP has been extensively used to explore the protein-protein interactions of transmembrane proteins (21Nathke I.S. Hinck L. Swedlow J.R. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We found that treatment of intact cells with DSP stabilized interaction between two 60-kDa proteins, so that more than 507 of the total receptors appeared as the 120-kDa form (Fig.1 A, −, +). A similar ratio of the dimeric form to the monomeric form was obtained when two different photoactivatable cross-linkers (bis-[ॆ-(4-azidosalicylaminido)ethyl]disulfide orN-5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyloxysuccinimide) were used (not shown). DSP is a lipophilic reagent; thus, the 120-kDa form could represent the δ-opioid receptor cross-linked with either a membrane-associated protein or a cytosolic protein. Deglycosylation should reduce the size of the 60-kDa receptor to 40 kDa as predicted by the primary structure; if the interacting protein is another δ-opioid receptor, the size of the 120-kDa form would be expected to reduce to 80 kDa. Alternatively, if the interacting protein is cytosolic, this protein would not be glycosylated, and deglycosylation would not be expected to reduce the size of the 120-kDa form to 80 kDa. We found that deglycosylation resulted in the generation of a 40-kDa form and an 80-kDa form (Fig.1 A, +, +), suggesting that the interacting protein is another receptor and that the δ-opioid receptors exist as dimers. To examine whether the δ-opioid receptor dimerization was influenced by receptor expression level, cross-linking experiments were performed using CHO cells with 10-fold difference in expression levels. The ratio of the dimeric form to the monomeric form in cells with a lower expression level is similar to the ratio of these two forms in cells expressing high levels of receptor (Fig. 1 B, MED andHI, respectively). These results indicate that in unstimulated cells, δ-opioid receptors exist both in monomeric and dimeric forms and that the ratio of these forms is independent of the level of receptor expression. To directly examine the presence of δ-opioid receptor dimers, we used co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of differentially epitope-tagged δ-opioid receptors. Specifically, a δ-opioid receptor tagged with the c-Myc epitope (MDOR) was co-expressed with the Flag epitope-tagged receptor (FDOR) in CHO or COS cells. The receptors from the cells expressing both FDOR and MDOR were immunoprecipitated using anti-c-Myc antibody, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Flag antibody. As seen in Fig. 1 C, anti-Flag antibody detected dimeric forms only in cells expressing both MDOR and FDOR and not in cells expressing only FDOR or only MDOR. The dimeric forms were also detected in CHO cells expressing both MDOR and FDOR (not shown). A band of 65–70 kDa and a faint band of 100 kDa was seen in COS cells expressing both FDOR and MDOR (Fig. 1 C). The 65–70-kDa protein represents the receptor monomer form. The nature of the 100-kDa protein is not known and needs further investigation. It is possible that this band represents the receptor monomer complexed with a G-protein; the size of this band is consistent with such a notion. A nonspecific band of 57 kDa is detected in all three lanes; this represents cross-reactivity of the secondary antibody with IgG molecules in the immunoprecipitation mixture. The fact that MDOR and FDOR were co-immunoprecipitated as part of a dimer complex implies that the δ-opioid receptors exist as a homodimers. To examine whether the agonist modulates the levels of the dimeric form of δ-opioid receptor, cells were treated with various doses of DADLE for 10 min at 37 °C prior to cross-linking at 4 °C. The stimulation of cells with increasing doses of DADLE decreased the levels of δ-opioid receptor dimer and correspondingly increased the levels of monomer (Fig. 2 A). This resulted in an agonist-induced decrease in the ratio of the dimeric form to the monomeric form. Maximal decrease of dimer to monomer ratio was caused by 1 ॖm DADLE, whereas 10 nm DADLE induced 507 reduction (Fig. 2 B). Cells treated with increasing doses of DADLE in the presence of the antagonist naloxone did not show a change in the dimer to monomer ratio (not shown). Treatment of cells with DSLET, DPDPE, or etorphine substantially reduced the ratio of the dimeric form to the monomeric form, whereas DAMGO, a ॖ-opioid receptor selective agonist, did not change the level of either δ-opioid receptor form (Fig.3). Treatment of the cells with naloxone alone did not affect the dimer to monomer ratio (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results suggest that the amount of δ-opioid receptors that exist in dimeric form can be modulated by either a peptide agonist or an alkaloid agonist and that this effect is reversible by the antagonist. Morphine, another opioid agonist, can bind to the δ-opioid receptor and induce its functional coupling to adenylyl cyclase (22Law P.Y. Bergsbaken C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 322-332PubMed Google Scholar, 23Law P.Y. Mcginn T.M. Wick M.J. Erikson L.J. Evans C. Loh H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 1686-1694PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other agonists, 10 ॖm morphine did not affect the levels of δ-opioid receptor dimer (Fig. 3). Morphine, at doses as high as 100 ॖm, is not able to induce rapid internalization of either δ- or ॖ-opioid receptor (5Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). This suggests that the ability of an agonist to induce interconversion of dimers to monomers is correlated with its ability to induce receptor internalization. The time course of change in the levels of dimeric form upon treatment with 100 nm DADLE showed a time-dependent decrease in the levels of this form and a corresponding increase in the levels of the monomeric form (Fig.4 A). This decrease is rapid; with a 3-min treatment with DADLE, an approximately 507 decrease in the levels of dimer was seen (Fig. 4 B). Longer exposure induced a further decrease in the dimer to monomer ratio. Cells treated for different time periods with 1 ॖm naloxone showed no change in the levels of the dimeric form (Fig. 4 B). Previously, it has been shown that the wild type δ-opioid receptor expressed in CHO and other cells shows rapid agonist-induced internalization (5Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The t½ of receptor internalization is dependent on the level of its expression. Cells with a low or medium level of the receptor expression exhibit agonist-induced internalization with a t½ of approximately 6–10 min, and cells with a high level of the receptor expression exhibit internalization with a t½ of approximately 30 min (Fig. 5). This is in contrast to the t½ of 3 min for the reduction of the dimer to monomer ratio (Fig. 5). These results show that treatment with DADLE induces a decrease in the levels of dimeric form faster than it induces receptor internalization, suggesting that the monomerization of the receptor precedes its internalization. We have previously reported that a 15-residue C-terminal deletion of the δ-opioid receptor substantially reduces the extent of agonist-induced internalization of the receptor (7Trapaidze N. Keith D.E. Cvejic S. Evans C.J. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To further delineate a relationship between the levels of receptor dimerization and agonist-induced internalization, we examined the forms of receptor in CHO cells expressing this ΔC15 mutant. The treatment of cells with DSP did not result in a change in the levels of the dimeric form (Fig.6). Furthermore, treatment with DADLE in the absence or in the presence of naloxone had no effect on the level of either of two forms (Fig. 6). The ratio of the dimeric form to the monomeric form in the ΔC15 mutant receptor-expressing cells treated with DSP was substantially lower than the ratio in the wild type receptor-expressing cells, and it remained same even when the mutant cells were treated with 1 ॖm DADLE. Taken together, these results suggest that the deletion of the 15 C-terminal amino acids prevents δ-opioid receptor dimer formation. The primary structure of the receptor shows no lysine in this region, excluding the possibility that lack of dimerization is due to deletion of the residue involved in cross-linking by DSP. The fact that the ΔC15 mutant exhibits a loss of agonist-induced changes in the levels of dimeric or monomeric form and a substantial reduction in agonist-induced internalization suggests that these two phenomena require structurally close molecular determinants of the receptor and that interconversion between the two receptor forms may have an important role in internalization. Furthermore, this result suggests that the existence of the receptor in the monomeric form is not sufficient for internalization. In this study we found that in unstimulated cells, the δ-opioid receptors exist as dimers. The existence of GPCRs in dimeric form is suggested by many pharmacological studies. For example, co-expression of truncated ॆ2ARs that individually do not transmit a signal resulted in formation of functional receptors (14Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1988; 240: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Similarly, co-expression of two different binding-defective point mutants of the angiotensin receptors restored binding activity (15Monnot C. Bihoreau C. Conchon S. Curnow K.M. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1507-1513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The existence of GPCR dimers is also shown by the use of two chimeric receptor molecules in which the C-terminal receptor domains were exchanged between the α2c-adrenergic receptor and the m3-muscarinic receptor; transfection of either of these receptors did not result in any detectable binding sites, whereas their co-expression resulted in the generation of a significant number of specific binding sites (16Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The existence of high molecular mass forms of adrenergic, dopamine, and many other GPCRs in unstimulated cells has been also directly shown (17Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P. Loisel T.P.

This suggests that although dimerization may be important for the GPCR function, the exact role of dimers may be different in these two receptor families. We found agonist-induced decrease in the level of δ-opioid receptor dimers. This effect was achieved with both peptide and alkaloid opioid agonists and it is antagonist reversible. Hebert et al. (17Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) have shown that agonist stimulation can stabilize the dimeric state of adrenergic receptor. The differences between these two findings could be due to the differences between these two receptors in the regulation of dimeric forms. Alternatively, these differences could be due to the different experimental systems used; whereas our studies were performed in the whole cell system, where cell signaling and other events that follow agonist binding are maintained, the studies with adrenergic receptor were performed with membranes (17Hebert T.E.

Morphine does not induce changes in the levels of the dimeric form of the δ-opioid receptor or its internalization even when used in concentrations that are 100-fold higher than its K D and EC50 values (5Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 23Law P.Y.

This finding shows a relationship between ability of an agonist to induce disappearance of dimers and to induce receptor internalization. The time course of reduction in the level of dimers with a concomitant increase in monomers (t½ = 3 min) is shorter than the time course of internalization (t½ = 30 min), suggesting that the monomerization precedes internalization (Fig. 5). Furthermore, treatments that inhibit receptor internalization, such as potassium depletion or sucrose pretreatment (7Trapaidze N. Keith D.E. Cvejic S. Evans C.J. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), had no effect on agonist-induced reduction in the level of dimers, 2S. Cvejic and L. A. Devi, unpublished observation. supporting the notion that monomerization precedes internalization. It is possible that binding of an agonist induces monomerization of the receptor, allowing interaction with adapter proteins involved in endocytosis or other proteins involved in signaling. The interconversion between dimeric and monomeric forms is agonist selective, and agonists (like morphine) that do not have the ability to induce this interconversion may also lack the ability to induce internalization. The conformation of GPCRs has been shown to be important for their dimerization. Whereas transmembrane regions of adrenergic and dopamine receptors regulate their dimerization (17Hebert T.E.

Barbier P. Fornai F. Corsini G.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31055-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We found that the deletion of the 15 C-terminal residues of the δ-opioid receptor prevents its dimerization. A possible explanation for the inability of this mutant to dimerize is that it forms high molecular mass complexes (Fig. 6) by interacting differently with itself or with other proteins, due to the conformational change induced by the lack of a portion of the C-tail. Such a form of the receptor would be able to bind ligands and efficiently transmit the signal but would not be able to internalize because of its inability to bind to proteins involved in endocytosis. We found that this mutant receptor has the ability to efficiently couple to adenylyl cyclase and that it forms clusters on the cell surface in response to agonist treatment (7Trapaidze N. Keith D.E. Cvejic S. Evans C.J. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A correlation between the lack of internalization and the increase in receptor clusters on the surface of the cell has been suggested by Hazum et al.(29Hazum E. Chang K.-J. Cuatrecasas P. Science. 1979; 206: 1077-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Hazum E. Chang K.-J. Cuatrecasas P. Nature. 1979; 282: 626-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Hazum E.

In these studies, it was shown that treatment of neuroblastoma cells with morphine or naloxone (ligands that cannot induce internalization) induces accumulation of clusters of opioid receptors, as detected by binding of rhodamine-enkephalin. Although interconversion between dimeric and monomeric forms precedes internalization, the existence of the receptor in monomeric form appears not to be sufficient for its internalization. The C-terminal deletion mutant of δ-opioid receptor that exists primarily in the monomeric form is unable to undergo rapid agonist-mediated internalization, suggesting that additional steps are required for receptor internalization. These steps could be regulated by the signals determined by the secondary structure/conformation of the receptor that is involved in the interconversion between the dimeric and monomeric forms. The finding that opioid receptors may exist in dimeric form opens additional ways of understanding the function of this receptor. δ-Opioid receptors have been classified into subgroups on the basis of their involvement in the modulation of ॖ-mediated antinociception (32Jiang Q. Mosberg H.I. Porreca F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 254: 683-689PubMed Google Scholar, 33Jiang Q. Mosberg H.I. Porreca F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 186: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On this basis, it has been suggested that some δ-opioid receptors form a functional complex with the ॖ-receptor, whereas others do not (for review, see Ref. 34Traynor J.R. Elliott J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 84-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Chronic morphine treatment selectively up-regulates a subpopulation of δ-opioid receptors that is a part of the ॖ·δ complex (11Rothman R.B. Danks J.A. Jacobson A.E. Burke Jr., T.R. Rice K.C.

Pharmacol. 1989; 160: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The existence of a ॖ·δ receptor complex is also supported by ligand binding studies using membranes and sections of rat brain; the results show that the irreversible ॖ-antagonist, ॆ-furnaltrexamine, selectively alkylates the opiate receptor complex, changing the binding of either ॖ or δ agonists for the receptors that are part of the ॖ·δ complex (35Rothman R.B.

Ther. 1988; 247: 405-416PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding possible differences in the affinity and efficacy of various agonists and antagonists for the monomeric and dimeric forms of the receptors and their differential ability to transmit signals can help explain the differences in the physiological responses they induce. The possibility of different opioid receptor subtypes forming heterodimers can help us to understand the phenomena in regions of the brain where two different subtypes of the receptors are co-expressed. In conclusion, dimerization of GPCR is emerging as an important mechanism for the regulation of these receptors. Understanding the dimerization of opioid receptors can help us to understand the role of this form of interaction in the function of opioid receptors and of the family of GPCRs in general.

Both isoforms were recruited to the CD95 death-inducing signaling complex and were activated upon CD95 stimulation with similar kinetics.

However, the role of these caspases in different cell death pathways in various tissues remains elusive. Caspase-3, for example, has been shown to be proteolytically activated upon CD95-induced cell death. In mice deficient of caspase-3, however, the CD95 apoptosis pathway was not affected in most tissues (33Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A.

In addition to the large number of different caspases, various isoforms of these molecules have been described at the mRNA level. Some of these isoforms have been found to be inactive splice variants such as ICEδ (34Alnemri E.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. J. Biol.

In this study, expression of the different FLICE isoforms on the protein level in various cell lines was determined by monoclonal antibodies covering the three functional domains of caspase-8. Only two caspase-8 isoforms were detected on the protein level of all cell lines tested. Both isoforms were recruited and activated by the CD95 DISC with identical kinetics. The monocytic cell line MonoMac, the T-cell lymphoma HUT78, the B-lymphoblastid cell line SKW6.4, the Burkitt lymphoma Raji, the Burkitt-like lymphoma BJAB, the colon carcinoma cell line HT-29, the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, the cervix carcinoma HeLa, the myorhabdosarcoma cell line KYM-1 (kind gift from M. Grell, Stuttgart, Germany), the small lung cell carcinoma line SCLC22H (kind gift from J. Fischer, Heidelberg, Germany), and the neuroblastoma SHEP (kind gift from M. Schwab, Heidelberg, Germany) were cultured in RPMI + 107 fetal calf serum, 0.05 mg/ml gentamycin, and 0.05 mg/ml HEPES. The hepatoma cell line HepG2, the gastric cancer line HS746T (both were a kind gift from M. Müller-Schilling, Heidelberg, Germany), and the embryonic kidney line 293T were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 107 fetal calf serum, 0.05 mg/ml gentamycin, and 0.05 mg/ml HEPES. All cells were of human origin. The affinity-purified rabbit anti-peptide antibodies anti-FLICE-N and anti-FLICE-C against the FLICE peptides 183–201 and 466–479, respectively, were generated as described previously (13Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Schevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). For the anti-FLICE mAbs, BALB/c mice were immunized four times by injection of 300 ॖg of either purified GST-N-FLICE or GST-C-FLICE. Spleen cells from immunized animals were fused with the Ag8 myeloma. 2 weeks after fusion culture supernatants from wells positive for growth were tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with HIS-FLICE as coated antigen. Hybridomas that produced anti-FLICE mAbs were cloned several times by limited dilution yielding subclones positive for the desired antibody. The anti-FLICE mAbs used in this study were C5 (IgG2a), C15 (IgG2b), and N2 (IgG1). The mouse mAb anti-APO-1 (IgG3, k) recognizes an epitope on the extracellular part of human APO-1 (CD95/Fas) (35Trauth B.C. Klas C. Peters A.M.J. Matzku S. Möller P. Falk W. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). All chemicals used were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) or Sigma. Using standard polymerase chain reaction and cloning techniques the following fusion proteins were generated: HIS-FLICE, GST-N-FLICE (amino acids 1–180), and GST-C-FLICE (amino acids 181–478). Fusion proteins were purified as described previously (4Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation mAbs (10 ॖg) were coupled to anti-IgG1 Agarose beads (Sigma) (N2), to protein A Sepharose beads (Sigma) (C15), or to protein A/G-plus Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (C5). After addition of in vitroactivated [35S]FLICE and incubation for more than 1 h at 4 °C, beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. The amount of DISC-associated FLICE was determined as follows: 5 × 106 SKW6.4 cells were either first treated with 2 ॖg/ml anti-APO-1 for 5 min at 37 °C and then lysed (stimulated condition) or first lysed and then supplemented with 2 ॖg/ml anti-APO-1 (unstimulated condition). 35S labeling, cell lysis, and immunoprecipitation of CD95 were done as described elsewhere (4Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). For Western blot detection of cytosolic proteins postnuclear supernatants equivalent to 1 × 106 cells or 50 ॖg of total protein as determined by the BCA method (Pierce) were separated by 127 SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis all samples were transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Corp.), blocked with 27 bovine serum albumin in PBS/Tween (PBS + 0.057 Tween 20) for at least 1 h, washed with PBS/Tween, and incubated with supernatant of anti-FLICE hybridomas diluted 1:5 in PBS/Tween for 16 h at 4 °C. Blots were washed with PBS/Tween and developed with goat anti-mouse IgG1 (N2), IgG2a (C5), or IgG2b (C15) (1:20000). After washing with PBS/Tween, the blots were developed with the chemiluminescence method (ECL) following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Corp.). The CD95 DISC was immunoprecipitated from 5 × 107 anti-APO-1-treated SKW6.4 cells (5 min) as described above, and immunoprecipitates were incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled FLICE (TNT, T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega) in FLICE cleavage buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 0.17 CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 107 sucrose) for 24 h at 4 °C. The cleavage reactions were stopped by addition of 17 SDS. After boiling for 3 min, samples were diluted 1:10 in lysis buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. The immunoprecipitates were separated on 157 SDS-PAGE, and the amplified dried gels were subjected to autoradiography. Using either GST fusion proteins with recombinant FLICE prodomain (GST-N-FLICE, amino acids 1–180) or the protease domain (GST-C-FLICE, amino acids 181–479) as an immunogen, different mouse anti-FLICE monoclonal antibodies were generated. Specificity of the antibodies was first established by Western blotting on recombinant GST-N-FLICE or GST-C-FLICE. The antibody N2 reacted only with GST-N-FLICE, whereas the antibodies C15 and C5 reacted only with GST-C-FLICE (Fig.1 A). We have recently shown that in vitro translated 35S-labeled FLICE can be activated in vitro by incubation with the immunoprecipitated DISC, resulting in the formation of cleavage intermediates p43 and p12, the prodomain p26, and the active subunits p18 and p10 (Fig. 1 C and Ref. 13Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Schevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). For further characterization of the antibodies in vitro activated35S-labeled FLICE was used in immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1 B). In addition to full-length FLICE, the N2 antibody immunoprecipitated the p43 and the p26 cleavage products, both containing the prodomain of FLICE. Interestingly, the band below full-length FLICE was not immunoprecipitated by N2 (Fig.1 B). This band represents N-terminal truncated FLICE due to the usage of an internal start site in the in vitrotranslation (13Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Schevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Therefore, the N2 mAb recognizes an epitope located within the first death effector domain of FLICE. The C15 mAb directed against the C terminus of FLICE immunoprecipitated all FLICE cleavage products containing the p18 domain. The antibody C5 precipitated p12 and p10, both representing the very C terminus of FLICE. Therefore, C5 is directed against the p10 subunit of FLICE. A number of isoforms of caspase-8 have been described at the mRNA level (9Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

Our mAb against the three major domains of FLICE (the prodomain and the active subunits p18 and p10) enabled us to test which of the reported caspase-8 isoforms were actually expressedin vivo. To this end several cell lines representing different tissues were tested for FLICE expression by Western blotting using the N2, C15, and C5 anti-FLICE mAbs (Fig.2). Surprisingly, all three antibodies detected only two bands of 55 and 53 kDa of equal intensity in almost all cells. Other caspase-8 isoforms were undetectable. The only reported caspase-8 isoform that was not expected to be detected with the antibodies used was caspase-8/e (Fig.3 and TableI).Figure 3Overview of all described caspase-8 isoforms at the RNA level.

Cases where binding of an antibody cannot be predicted because the exact epitope for the anti-FLICE mAbs C15 and C5 is not known are labeled with question marks. Expression levels of the two detected caspase-8 isoforms were very different, spanning a range from high expression in the B-cell line SKW6.4 or the myorhabdosarcoma cell line KYM-1 to low expression in the embryonic kidney cell line 293T. Interestingly, the small lung cell carcinoma line SCLC22H was negative for FLICE expression. The third band detected only by the C5 mAb in the hepatoma line HepG2 likely represents a nonspecific background band because a FLICE isoform of this size (43 kDa) should contain the p18 subunit of FLICE and should therefore also be detected by the C15 mAb. After longer exposure of the three immunoblots, additional bands were detectable (data not shown), most of which represent unspecific binding of the anti-FLICE antibodies with cellular proteins. In summary, of the eight isoforms of caspase-8 described at the mRNA level, only two are expressed as proteins in significant amounts in all 13 cell lines tested. We have recently shown that FLICE is recruited to the CD95 receptor in a stimulation-dependent manner forming the DISC (4Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar, 8Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O' Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Scaffidi C. Zhang M. Ni J. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). To test whether the second FLICE isoform is also recruited to the CD95 receptor, we analyzed the DISC by one-dimensional as well as by two-dimensional Western blotting, using the C15 anti-FLICE mAb. As shown in Fig. 4 A, both FLICE isoforms were recruited to the CD95 receptor in a stimulation-dependent manner. The comparison between the two-dimensional Western blot and the DISC precipitation from35S-labeled cells (Fig. 4 B) confirmed that the upper FLICE isoform was identical with CAP4, whereas the lower isoform was hidden underneath a background spot in the 35S-DISC precipitation that was also detected under unstimulated conditions. As both FLICE isoforms were recruited to the DISC we tested next whether both are cleaved upon triggering of CD95. Therefore, we analyzed the lysate of either untreated cells or cells stimulated with the anti-APO-1 antibody for 1 h in a Western blot experiment using the three different anti-FLICE mAbs. Prolonged stimulation of CD95 resulted in almost complete cleavage of both FLICE isoforms (Fig.5 A, lanes 2,4, and 6). Cleavage of both full-length FLICE bands during stimulation resulted in the formation of only one p18 and p10 cleavage product as detected by the C terminus-specific mAbs C15 and C5, respectively indicating that both isoforms did not differ in their C terminus ICE-like domains (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1–4). To confirm this we made use of the rabbit antibody anti-FLICE-C, which was directed against the very C terminus. This antibody was able to precipitate both FLICE isoforms, confirming that they did not differ in their C terminus (Fig. 5 A,lanes 9 and 10). However, the N terminus-specific anti-FLICE mAb N2 detected two different FLICE cleavage products, p26 and p24, after CD95 stimulation (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5and 6). In addition, two bands, p43 and p41, were also detected, representing intermediates after cleavage between the p18 and the p10 subunit of FLICE, because they were also weakly detected by the C15 antibody (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1, 2,5, and 6). Therefore, the two isoforms of FLICE differed in the size of their prodomains. Given the molecular weight and pI of 53 kDa and 4.91, respectively, and the difference in the prodomain, the described isoform of caspase-8 that most likely represents the second band is caspase-8/b (MACHα2) (Fig. 3). This isoform differs from FLICE in a box of 15 amino acids that is not present in caspase-8/b (9Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar). To further test this assumption we made use of the rabbit antibody anti-FLICE-N, which was directed against these 15 amino acids. Using SDS-boiled lysates from unstimulated cells the anti-FLICE-N antibody only precipitated the upper FLICE band (Fig 5A, lanes 7 and 8). In SDS-boiled lysates from stimulated cells, the antibody only recognized the p43 intermediate and the p26 prodomain. We therefore conclude that the second FLICE isoform that is expressed on the protein level is caspase-8/b that lacks the 15 amino acids recognized by the FLICE-N antibody. We have recently described two novel DISC components CAP5 and CAP6 representing the prodomain of FLICE after proteolytic activation (13Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Schevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). To test whether these new DISC components represent the two prodomains of the expressed FLICE isoforms we analyzed the DISC in a two-dimensional Western blot using the N2 anti-FLICE mAb. The p26 and p24 cleavage products comigrated with CAP5 and CAP6, respectively (Fig.5 B and data not shown). Only CAP5 was precipitated by the anti-FLICE-N antibody, confirming that CAP6 represents the prodomain of caspase-8/b that does not contain the epitope recognized by anti-FLICE-N, whereas CAP5 represents the prodomain of caspase-8/a. Because both FLICE isoforms were recruited to and activated by the CD95 DISC, we tested next whether they showed any differences in cleavage kinetics. Therefore, we analyzed the cleavage of caspase-8/a and 8/b at the DISC level and in the cytosol at various time points after CD95 stimulation. Consistent with the fast kinetics of CD95-mediated apoptosis both isoforms were recruited to the DISC within 10 s (Fig. 6 A). Also after 10 s the two cleavage intermediates p43 and p41 as well as the prodomain cleavage products p26 and p24 were detectable in the DISC. In the cytosol all the FLICE cleavage products p26, p24, p18, and p10 were detectable as early as 10 s after activation (Fig. 6 B). The cleavage products p26 and p24 as a readout for the activation of caspase-8/a and 8/b, respectively, increased in the cytosol during stimulation with identical kinetics, demonstrating that both isoforms were activated simultaneously. Interestingly, at the DISC level there was only a slight increase in the p26 and p24 cleavage products starting after 10 min when the amount of full-length FLICE began to decline (Fig. 6 A). This suggests that there is only a limited capacity of the DISC to bind death effector domain-containing proteins. Notably, FLICE cleavage at the DISC level preceded cleavage in the cytosol, confirming that FLICE turnover takes place at the DISC level where all cytosolic FLICE is processed (Fig. 6 B and Ref. 13Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Schevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data show that only two different isoforms of caspase-8 are expressed as proteins and that both are activated simultaneously upon CD95 triggering. Signal transduction through the CD95 receptor has been shown to involve activation of caspases. Recently, a new member of this family of cysteine proteases, FLICE (MACH/MCH5/caspase-8) was cloned (9Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

Several different isoforms of caspase-8 have been described as cDNA clones that were identified either by yeast two-hybrid screening (9Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar) or by data base search for homologous expressed sequence tag sequences (10Fernandes-Alnemri T.

A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Originally, only FLICE (caspase-8/a) was shown to be expressed on the protein level, because it was cloned by purification of a protein, CAP4, that specifically associated with the CD95 DISC (8Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O' Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Scaffidi C. Zhang M. Ni J. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). To test if any of the other caspase-8 isoforms were expressed on the protein level, we developed specific anti-FLICE mAbs covering all different functional domains of FLICE. Only one of the described isoforms (caspase-8/e) was not expected to be detectable by these mAbs (Fig. 3and Table I). However, such a truncated version of caspase-8 may not have a physiological function. Using the anti-FLICE mAbs we now demonstrate that only two caspase-8 isoforms are expressed at detectable levels in a number of different cell lines. Interestingly, the Burkitt lymphoma line Raji also expressed only these two isoforms as protein, although five different caspase-8 mRNA species were cloned from this cell line (9Boldin M.P.

Both expressed caspase-8 isoforms were recruited to the CD95 receptor in an activation-dependent manner. By comparison of the two-dimensional Western blot with immunoprecipitated DISC from35S-labeled cells, we could confirm that the expressed caspase-8 isoform of 55 kDa corresponds to FLICE (caspase-8/a, MACHα1), originally described as CAP4 (4Kischkel F.C.

We identified the second expressed caspase-8 isoform as caspase8/b (MACHα2), because this protein could not be immunoprecipitated by the rabbit anti-peptide antibody anti-FLICE-N directed against a box of 15 amino acids not present in caspase-8/b (MACHα2). Different caspase-8 isoforms have been suggested to function as modulators of the activation of caspase-8 in CD95- or TNF-induced apoptosis (9Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar). Caspase-8/c (MACHα3) has been demonstrated to protect against CD95- and TNF-induced apoptosis, whereas caspase-8/d (MACHॆ1) was suggested to enhance the cytotoxic activity of the active caspase-8 isoforms (caspase-8/a and 8/b) (9Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar). However, none of these isoforms were detected by the anti-FLICE mAbs in significant amounts in any of the cell lines tested. Whether both expressed active isoforms caspase-8/a and 8/b have different functions remains to be determined. The fact that both were expressed in a one to one ratio in all cell lines tested as well as the identical CD95-induced activation kinetics suggests the possibility that both isoforms are necessary in equal amounts for the signal transduction of the CD95 receptor. Recently, the number of apoptosis-inducing receptors has increased. The fact that FLICE was expressed in almost every cell line, some of which do not have the CD95 receptor or do not respond to CD95 triggering, raises the possibility that FLICE is also utilized by the signaling pathways of the other 舠death receptors舡 such as TNF receptor 1, DR3 (APO-3/TRAMP/Wsl-1/LARD), or DR4 (TRAILR) (3Peter M.E. Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Kischkel F.C. Krammer P.H. Kumar S. Apoptosis, Problems and Diseases. Springer, Heidelberg, Germany1997Google Scholar). Future studies should clarify the involvement of the different caspase-8 isoforms in other cell death signaling pathways.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) has been implicated as a mediator of fatty acid effects on gene transcription. This report uses the PPARα-deficient mouse to examine the role of PPARα in the PUFA regulation of mRNAs encoding hepatic lipogenic (fatty acid synthase (FAS) and the S14 protein (S14)), microsomal (cytochrome P450 4A2 (CYP4A2)), and peroxisomal (acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX)) enzymes. PUFA ingestion induced mRNAAOX (2.3-fold) and mRNACYP4A2(8-fold) and suppressed mRNAFAS and mRNAS14 by ≥807 in wild type mice. In PPARα-deficient mice, PUFA did not induce mRNAAOX or mRNACYP4A2, indicating a requirement for PPARα in the PUFA-mediated induction of these enzymes. However, PUFA still suppressed mRNAFAS and mRNAS14 in the PPARα-deficient mice. Studies in rats provided additional support for the differential regulation of lipogenic and peroxisomal enzymes by PUFA. These studies provide evidence for two distinct pathways for PUFA control of hepatic lipid metabolism. One requires PPARα and is involved in regulating peroxisomal and microsomal enzymes.

PPARs also have inhibitory effects on gene transcription. For example, apolipoprotein CIII and transferrin gene expression is inhibited by PPAR-RXR competition for an HNF-4 binding site within the promoters of these genes (34Hertz R. Bishara-Shieban J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8493-8497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent gene targeting studies clearly demonstrate that PPARα is required for the pleiotropic response to peroxisome proliferators including an increase in hepatic mRNAs encoding peroxisomal and microsomal enzymes (40Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz K.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar).This report examines the role of PPARα in PUFA-regulation of mRNAs encoding hepatic lipogenic, microsomal and peroxisomal enzymes. In this work, we assessed PUFA regulation of theS14 gene and fatty acid synthase, models for lipogenic gene expression, and acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) and cytochrome P450A2 (CYP4A2), enzymes involved in peroxisomal and microsomal fatty acid oxidation, respectively. The recently developed PPARα-null mouse (40Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz K.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar) was used to determine whether PPARα mediates PUFA regulation of hepaticAOX, CYP4A2, S14, and FASgene expression. This work shows that while PPARα is required for the PUFA-mediated induction of both AOX and CYP4A2gene expression, it is not required for the PUFA-mediated inhibition of either S14 or FAS gene expression. These and other studies indicate that PUFA regulation of hepatic gene transcription involves at least two distinct pathways, a PPARα-dependent and a PPARα-independent pathway.DISCUSSIONPPARα is the predominant PPAR subtype expressed in rat liver and it plays a central role in the induction of hepatic peroxisomal and microsomal fatty acid oxidation (24Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 40Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz K.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Since several peroxisomal, microsomal and lipogenic enzymes are regulated by PUFA at the pretranslational level, we tested the hypothesis that dietary PUFA regulate hepatic fatty acid oxidation and de novolipogenesis through a common mediator, i.e. PPARα. Interestingly, all studies reporting on fatty acid regulation of PPARα have been carried out by over expressing receptors in established cell lines. No studies have directly examined the role PPARα may have in fatty acid-regulated hepatic gene transcription. The PPARα-null mouse allows such an analysis. Coupling this genetic approach with other studies has allowed us to show for the first time that 1) PPARα is required for PUFA-mediated induction of hepatic mRNAAOX and mRNACYP4A2 (Fig. 1); 2) PPARα is not required for PUFA-mediated suppression of mRNAS14 or mRNAFAS (Fig. 1); 3) while 18:2 (n-6), 18:3 (n-6 and n-3), 20:4 (n-6) and 20:5 (n-3) suppress mRNAS14 and mRNAFAS, only 20:5 (n-3) induces mRNAAOX in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 4); 4) while gemfibrozil induces hepatic mRNAAOX, it has little or no effect on mRNAS14 or mRNAFAS (Fig. 3). Taken together, these studies indicate that PUFA control of peroxisome/microsomal fatty acid oxidation and de novo lipogenesis in rat liver does not involved PPARα as a common mediator. The differential effect of specific fatty acids, i.e. 18:2, 18:3 (n-3 andn-6), 20:4 (n-6), versus gemfibrozil underscores the lack of coordinate regulation of these pathways in rat liver. Such studies indicate that PUFA regulates at least two pathways in liver, one involves PPARα and controls expression of genes encoding proteins involved in peroxisomal and microsomal fatty acid oxidation. The other mechanism is PPARα-independent and is involved in the PUFA-mediated suppression of lipogenic gene expression.PUFA suppress hepatic mRNAS14 and mRNAFAS levels by inhibiting gene transcription (15Blake W.L. Clarke S.D. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 1727-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. MacDougald O.A. Thelen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Aci. U. S.

From the data reported above, this inhibitory mechanism does not require PPARα. Although the mechanism of PUFA induction of hepatic mRNAAOX and mRNACYP4A2 has not been established, the following studies implicate transcription as the principal mode of PUFA regulation of AOX andCYP4A: 1) peroxisomal proliferators rapidly induce transcription of genes encoding AOX, the bifunctional enzyme, thiolase and CYP4A subtypes 1–3 (26Reddy J.K.

Thelen A. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17167-17173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 45Jump D.B. Ren B Clarke S Thelen A. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 52: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) did not converge. Analysis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 gene expression indicated that peroxisome proliferators/PPAR induced by PUFA-suppressed transcription (46Miller C.W. Ntambi J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Such studies argued against PPAR as a mediator of PUFA effects on lipogenic gene transcription. However, the over expression of receptors does not necessarily reflect physiologically relevant processes. The use of the PPARα-null mouse allows us to directly evaluate the role PPARα plays in PUFA regulation of hepatic gene expression. In contrast to (+/+) mice, hepatic mRNAAOX and mRNACYP4A2 was not significantly induced in PPARα (−/−) mice by the PUFA diet indicating a requirement for PPARα in the PUFA-mediated induction of these enzymes. The fact that hepatic mRNAS14 and mRNAFAS was suppressed in both (+/+) and (−/−) mice provides strong evidence against a requirement for PPARα for PUFA-mediated suppression of S14 and FAS gene transcription. While these studies confirm our earlier suggestion that PPAR did not mediate PUFA suppression of S14 gene transcription, they provide new information on the requirement for PPARα in the PUFA-induction of AOX and CYP4A2and the lack of involvement of PPARα in PUFA-mediated suppression ofFAS gene transcription or L-pyruvate kinase gene expression.2 While other PPAR subtypes (PPARγ and PPARδ) (24Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 39Huang Q. Alvares K. Chu R. Bradfield C.A. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8493-8497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are expressed in liver, Northern analyses suggests PPARγ and δ are minor subtypes in rodent liver. However, their role in PUFA control of hepatic gene expression cannot be excluded.An important outcome of these studies is the finding that of all the PUFA tested, only 20:5 (n-3) activates PPARα in liver. Several groups have reported on fatty acid activation of PPARs in established cells lines like CV-1 and HeLa (20Gottlicher M. Widmark E. Li Q. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Recently three groups reported that specific fatty acids, i.e. 18:2 (n-6), 18:3 (n-3 and n-6), and 20:4 (n-6) are ligands for PPARα (47Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 48Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). These same ligands do not activate PPARα or induce mRNAAOX in primary hepatocytes (Figs. 4 and 5). Feeding animals soybean or corn oil, oils containing 18:2 and 18:3 fatty acids, does not induce peroxisomal enzymes (4Flatmark T. Nilsson A. Kvannes J. Eikhom T.S. Fukami M.H. Kryvi H. Christiansen E.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 962: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This apparent conflict can be reconciled by the fact that primary hepatocytes have a high capacity for fatty acid oxidation, triglyceride synthesis and very low density lipoprotein secretion (7Rustan A.C. Nossen J.O. Christiansen E.N. Drevon C.A. J. Lipids Res. 1988; 29: 1417-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We speculate that these pathways prevent intracellular fatty acids from accumulating to levels that activate PPARα. Interestingly, 20:5 (n-3) was the only PUFA tested here that activated PPARα. 20:5 (n-3) is reported to be poorly oxidized in mitochondria and poorly incorporated into complex lipids, such as triglycerides (7Rustan A.C. Nossen J.O. Christiansen E.N. Drevon C.A. J. Lipids Res. 1988; 29: 1417-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, 20:5 (n-3) might accumulate in the cell and mimic a state of fatty acid overload in the liver. Fatty acid overload resulting from high fat feeding (>507 calories as fat), uncompensated diabetes and liver disease have all been reported to increase peroxisomal ॆ-oxidation (26Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 50Kaikaus R.M. Chan W.K. Lysenko N. Ray R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Bass N.M. J. Biol.

Recent studies have suggested that the leukotriene, LTB4, is a ligand for PPARα (52Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J."

The identification of ॆ-arrestins as GPCR trafficking molecules suggested that ॆ-arrestins might represent critical determinants for GPCR resensitization. Therefore, we tested whether ॆ2-adrenergic receptor (ॆ2AR) resensitization was dependent upon ॆ-arrestins and an intact clathrin-coated vesicle endocytic pathway. The overexpression of either the ॆ-arrestin 1-V53D dominant negative inhibitor of ॆ2AR sequestration or dynamin I-K44A to block clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis impaired both ॆ2AR dephosphorylation and resensitization. In contrast, resensitization of a sequestration-impaired ॆ2AR mutant (Y326A) was reestablished following the overexpression of either GRK2 or ॆ-arrestin 1. Moreover, ॆ2ARs did not resensitize in COS-7 cells as the consequence of impaired sequestration and dephosphorylation. However, ॆ2AR resensitization was restored in these cells following the overexpression of ॆ-arrestin 2. These findings demonstrate, using both loss and gain of function paradigms, that ॆ2AR dephosphorylation and resensitization are dependent upon an intact sequestration pathway. These studies also indicate that ॆ-arrestins play an integral role in regulating not only the desensitization and intracellular trafficking of GPCRs but their ability to resensitize. ॆ-Arrestin expression levels appear to underlie cell type-specific differences in the regulation of GPCR resensitization.

Sequestration, the cellular event leading to GPCR endocytosis and recycling, is initiated by the agonist-promoted mobilization of cell surface receptors to an intracellular vesicular compartment, probably endosomes (4Moore R.H.

Receptors internalized via clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) and/or caveolae are thought to be resensitized in endosomes following their dephosphorylation by a membrane-associated phosphatase that exhibits specificity for G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-phosphorylated GPCRs residing in an acidified endosomal environment (8Sibley D.R.

Subsequently, these dephosphorylated receptors must be mobilized back to the cell surface to reestablish normal receptor signaling (7Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Lovett M. Vigna S.R. Frucht M.M.

However, the molecular mechanisms contributing to each of these events and their relative contributions to the resensitization of GPCR responsiveness are only now becoming recognized. A role for receptor phosphorylation in the sequestration process was suggested by the observation that overexpression of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in cells expressing the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor could augment agonist-mediated internalization (11Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally using a sequestration-defective ॆ2-adrenergic receptor (ॆ2AR) mutant (Y326A), GRK-mediated phosphorylation, and ॆ-arrestin binding, the same molecular intermediates required for receptor desensitization were demonstrated to initiate ॆ2AR endocytosis (12Ferguson S.S.G.

These studies also demonstrated that GRK phosphorylation was not absolutely required for ॆ2AR sequestration (12Ferguson S.S.G. Menard L. Barak L.S. Colapietro A.-M. Koch W.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). A role of ॆ-arrestin in wild-type ॆ2AR sequestration was established using ॆ-arrestin mutants, which specifically impaired wild-type receptor sequestration without altering the ability of the receptor to become phosphorylated or desensitized (13Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that GPCRs can utilize several distinct endocytic pathways (14Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

However, in the case of the ॆ2AR, a growing body of evidence supports the idea that the endocytic route employed by this receptor is mainly the same CCV-mediated pathway utilized by constitutively recycling transferrin and low density lipoprotein receptors (4Moore R.H.

The identification of ॆ-arrestins as GPCR-specific endocytic trafficking proteins provides the first opportunity to directly assess, using GPCR-interacting proteins, the hypothesis that sequestration and more importantly normal ॆ-arrestin function (as a GPCR-specific adaptor protein) is absolutely required for normal ॆ2AR dephosphorylation and resensitization. In addition, we examine, using dynamin I-K44A as an inhibitor of CCV-mediated endocytosis, whether ॆ2AR resensitization is dependent upon an intact CCV endocytic pathway. Moreover, we establish that ॆ2AR resensitization in different cell types is regulated by differences in the endogenous expression levels of ॆ-arrestin proteins.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance when appropriate and multiple comparisons between groups were made using a two-tailed t test for independent samples. Dose response data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. We have reported that overexpression of ॆ-arrestin 1-V53D, a dominant negative inhibitor of ॆ2AR sequestration, increased the extent of agonist-induced ॆ2AR phosphorylation, suggesting that ॆ-arrestin might play a role in ॆ2AR dephosphorylation and resensitization (13Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). To begin to test this question, the effect of overexpressing either wild-type ॆ-arrestin or ॆ-arrestin 1-V53D on ॆ2AR dephosphorylation was examined in HEK 293 cells. In the absence of overexpressed ॆ-arrestins, agonist stimulation with 10 ॖm isoproterenol for 10 min increased the extent of ॆ2AR phosphorylation 3.1 ± 0.3-fold over basal level (Fig. 1 A). When cells were allowed to recover for 20 min following the removal of agonist, ॆ2AR dephosphorylation (61 ± 67) was observed (Fig. 1, A and B). Overexpression of ॆ-arrestin 1 led to a reduction in agonist-induced ॆ2AR phosphorylation (75 ± 47 of control ॆ2AR phosphorylation) without significantly affecting the ability of the receptor to be dephosphorylated (54 ± 37 of matched control) (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, ॆ-arrestin 1-V53D not only increased the extent of agonist-induced ॆ2AR phosphorylation (137 ± 147 of control ॆ2AR phosphorylation) but significantly impaired the ability of the receptor to be dephosphorylated (28 ± 127 of matched control) (Fig. 1, A and B). While complete inhibition of ॆ2AR dephosphorylation was not observed in the presence of ॆ-arrestin 1-V53D, the absolute value of ॆ2AR phosphorylation remained 95 ± 97 of control ॆ2AR phosphorylation. Taken together, these data indicate that normal ॆ-arrestin function contributes to the regulation of ॆ2AR dephosphorylation. To determine whether normal ॆ-arrestin function and receptor dephosphorylation were absolutely required for ॆ2AR resensitization, the ability of the ॆ2AR to both desensitize and resensitize in the presence of either wild-type or V53D mutant ॆ-arrestin was tested in HEK 293 cells. When expressed alone, the ॆ2AR desensitized in response to a desensitizing stimulus (10 ॖm isoproterenol for 15 min), which was measured as a 2-fold rightward shift in the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) and a 43 ± 37 reduction in the maximal velocity (V max) for agonist-stimulated ॆ2AR-responsive adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 2 A). When cells were allowed to recover for 30 min in agonist-free media, following the desensitizing stimulus, complete resensitization of ॆ2AR-responsive adenylyl cyclase activity was observed (Fig. 2 A).

Ther. 1977; 201: 138-147PubMed Google Scholar), these effects being attributed to a partial block by dantrolene of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (1Ward A. Chaffman M.O. Sorkin E.M. Drugs. 1986; 32: 130-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 5Van Winkle W.B. Science. 1976; 193: 1130-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 6Putney J.W. Biancri C.P.

In contrast to these pronounced effects on skeletal muscle, effects of dantrolene on cardiac muscle contractility are mild or absent (1Ward A. Chaffman M.O. Sorkin E.M.

Clinically, dantrolene has proven effective in the treatment of malignant hyperthermia (MH), a potentially fatal genetic disorder of skeletal muscle E-C coupling in which exposure to volatile anesthetics triggers uncontrolled SR Ca2+ release, muscle contracture, and accelerated metabolism (8Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of the action of dantrolene remains undefined but is generally presumed to involve either direct or indirect inhibitory effects on ryanodine receptor (RYR) Ca2+ channels. To date, three RYR isoforms have been identified in mammalian tissues and are termed RYR1, RYR2, and RYR3 (9Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, the RYR1 isoform is the major pathway for SR Ca2+ release during E-C coupling, and defects in these channels have been linked to MH susceptibility in pigs and in certain human families (8Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 10Fujii J. Otsu K. Zorzato F. DeLeon S. Khanna V.K. Weiler J.E. O'Brien P.J. MacLennan D.H. Science. 1991; 253: 448-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that high-affinity [3H]dantrolene and [3H]ryanodine binding sites are localized to the same or closely associated skeletal muscle SR membrane fractions (11Parness J. Palnitkar S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18465-18472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Palnitkar S.S. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Parness J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). RYR1 channels thus constitute a likely target for the physiologic and therapeutic actions of dantrolene on skeletal muscle Ca2+ regulation. Nonetheless, the precise mechanism by which dantrolene may affect the activation of RYR1 channels has remained unclear. In particular, it is not yet clear how dantrolene may alter RYR1 activation by the physiologic effectors of these channels that have been identified in studies using isolated SR vesicles preparations (13Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). In addition, whether the effects of dantrolene may reflect a direct interaction with the RYR1 channel complex itself or rather require dantrolene binding to a separate and as yet unidentified regulatory molecule in the SR membrane remains controversial (12Palnitkar S.S. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Parness J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Nelson T.E. Lin M. Zapata-Sudo G. Sudo R.T.

Finally, whether the effects of dantrolene may be restricted to the RYR1 channel isoform or may extend to other intracellular Ca2+ release channel isoforms is also in question (16Mody I. MacDonald J.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 356-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The answers to these questions may be important not only in defining the mechanism of action of dantrolene but also in clarifying those aspects of RYR channel regulation that may be specific to skeletal muscle E-C coupling and that may be altered in MH. In this study, we have examined the effects of dantrolene on the45Ca2+ release and [3H]ryanodine binding activity of isolated SR vesicles prepared from MH-susceptible (MHS) and normal pig skeletal muscle. The effects of dantrolene on cardiac SR vesicle 45Ca2+ release and [3H]ryanodine binding were also examined. Our results demonstrate specific inhibitory effects of dantrolene on the functional activity of skeletal muscle RYR1 channels that are consistent with the effects of dantrolene on E-C coupling in intact muscle and suggest a mechanism of action in which a direct, high-affinity interaction of dantrolene with the RYR1 channel complex may limit the activation of this channel by calmodulin (CaM) and Ca2+. Pigs homozygous for either the MHS or normal RYR1 allele were obtained from the University of Minnesota Experimental Farm and genotyped on the basis of the Arg615 → Cys MHS mutation (10Fujii J. Otsu K. Zorzato F. DeLeon S. Khanna V.K. Weiler J.E. O'Brien P.J. MacLennan D.H. Science. 1991; 253: 448-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). 45Ca2+ and [3H]ryanodine were purchased from NEN Life Science Products (Boston, MA). Unlabeled ryanodine was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Dantrolene (1-[[5-(p-nitrophenyl)furfurylidine]amino]hydantoin sodium), AMPPCP (a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog), and porcine brain CaM were from Sigma. Azumolene and aminodantrolene were manufactured by Proctor & Gamble (Norwich, NY) and were kindly provided by the laboratories of Drs. E. Gallant (University of Minnesota) and J. Parness (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey). Stock solutions of dantrolene, azumolene, and aminodantrolene (typically 1 mm) were prepared in 707 methanol for use on the same day. Skeletal muscle SR vesicles were isolated from the longissimus dorsi muscle of MHS and normal pigs as described previously (17Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Shomer N.H. Roghair T. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 192-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, vesicles obtained by differential ultracentrifugation of a muscle homogenate were extracted with 0.6m KCl and subsequently fractionated on discontinuous sucrose gradients. The terminal-cisternae-derived (i.e.舠heavy舡) SR vesicles that band at the 36–407 interface were collected and stored frozen at −70 °C. Cardiac muscle SR vesicles were isolated from porcine ventricular tissue (17Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Shomer N.H. Roghair T. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 192-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following homogenization in 10 mm NaHCO3, membranes were extracted in 0.6 m KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and then resuspended in 107 sucrose and stored frozen at −70 °C. All isolation buffers contained a mixture of protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). SR vesicles (10–15 mg of protein/ml) were passively loaded for 2–3 h at 36 °C in media containing 150 mm potassium propionate, 15 mmPipes, pH 7.0, 5 mm45Ca2+, 1 ॖm CaM, 1 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin, and either 10 ॖm dantrolene or an equivalent volume of methanol vehicle (final concentration 0.77). Dantrolene did not affect the amount of 45Ca2+ loaded (42 ± 3.6 nmol/mg for skeletal SR vesicles, n = 6; 36 ± 6.3 nmol/mg for cardiac SR vesicles, n = 4).45Ca2+-loaded vesicles (2 ॖl) were placed on the side of a polystyrene tube containing 200 ॖl of a Ca2+ release medium (150 mm potassium propionate, 15 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 8.6 mm EGTA, 3 mm AMPPCP, 3 mm MgCl2 (free Mg2+ ∼0.45 mm), 2 mm calcium acctate2 (free Ca2+, ∼100 nm), 1 ॖm CaM, 0.77 methanol, and 10 ॖmdantrolene, as indicated. Ca2+ release was initiated by rapid mixing and stopped at the indicated times (1–10 s using a metronome) by rapid dilution into 12 ml of a release-inhibiting medium (150 mm potassium propionate, 15 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20 ॖm ruthenium red), followed immediately by filtration onto 0.45-ॖm Millipore HA membranes. The fraction of total loaded45Ca2+ that was not released after 10-s incubations in release media containing Ca2+ ionophore was considered background and was subtracted from all determinations. Estimates of the time required for vesicles to release half of their45Ca2+ contents (t 1/2) were based on fits to the equation, R = R max × t/(t 1/2 +t), where R is Ca2+ released,R max is the maximal Ca2+ release, and t is time. SR vesicles were preincubated at 36 °C for 10 min in media containing dantrolene (0–30 ॖm, as indicated), 150 mm potassium propionate, 15 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 3 mm AMPPCP, 2.7 mm MgCl2 (free Mg2+, ∼0.35 mm), 1 ॖm CaM, and a calcium acetate2-EGTA buffer set to give the desired Ca2+ concentration (100 nm, except where otherwise indicated). Following addition of [3H]ryanodine (100 nm), SR vesicles were incubated for 90 min at 36 °C, collected on Whatman GF/B filters, and washed with 8 ml of ice-cold 150 mm KCl. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 20 ॖm nonradioactive ryanodine. Data are expressed as percentages of the maximal [3H]ryanodine binding capacity of SR vesicle preparations as determined within each experiment in media containing 450 mm KCl, 10 mm ATP and 10 ॖm Ca2+ (12.2 ± 1.8 pmol/mg for skeletal muscle SR, n = 8; 4.0 ± 0.9 for cardiac SR, n = 3). Determinations ofK i values for the inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding by dantrolene and dantrolene analogues were based on fits to the Hill equation. RYR1 was isolated on sucrose gradients from Chaps-solubilized skeletal muscle SR essentially as described (18Shomer N.H. Louis C.F. Fill M. Litterer L.A. Mickelson J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 264: C125-C135Crossref Google Scholar). For reconstitution of the isolated RYR channel complex into liposomes, gradient fractions containing RYR protein were pooled, concentrated, and diluted (0.1 mg SR protein/ml) into 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 8 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine, 17 Chaps, and dialyzed for 48 h at 4 °C against 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm ॆ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin. Reconstituted RYR1-containing proteoliposomes were collected by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min and stored frozen at −70 °C. Prior to use, proteoliposome vesicles were slowly thawed, resuspended in 150 mm potassium propionate, 15 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, then sonicated 4 min in a bath sonicator. Proteoliposomes prepared from 2 MHS and 2 normal animals exhibited a mean [3H]ryanodine binding capacity of 154 ± 23 pmol/mg protein. To investigate the effect of dantrolene on the Ca2+ permeability of skeletal muscle SR,45Ca2+ release from passively loaded SR vesicles was examined at 36 °C in a medium that contained putative physiological effectors of RYR channels (adenine nucleotide, Mg2+, Ca2+, and CaM, as described under 舠Experimental Procedures舡). The effects of dantrolene were examined at a concentration (10 ॖm) that approximates therapeutic plasma levels (2Flewellen E.H. Nelson T.E. Jones W.P. Arens J.F. Wagner D.L. Anesthesiology. 1983; 59: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and is known to effectively inhibit the contractility of intact skeletal muscle fiber preparations (1Ward A. Chaffman M.O. Sorkin E.M. Drugs. 1986; 32: 130-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the absence of dantrolene, MHS SR vesicles (Fig.1 A) exhibited an increased rate of 45Ca2+ release in comparison to normal SR vesicles (Fig. 1 B). The t 1/2 for45Ca2+ release from MHS SR vesicles was thus only one fifth of that from normal SR vesicles (TableI), consistent with the well-documented increased MHS RYR1 channel activity under a variety of experimental conditions (8Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In the presence of dantrolene, the rate of45Ca2+ release from both MHS and normal SR vesicles was decreased (t 1/2 for release increased ∼3.5-fold for both MHS and normal SR, Table I).45Ca2+ release studies were also performed at 19 °C as previous studies have indicated that the effects of dantrolene on intact mammalian fiber preparations are absent below 20 °C (4Morgan K.G. Bryant S.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1977; 201: 138-147PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ohta T. Endo M. Nakano T. Morohoshi Y. Wanikawa K. Ohga A. Am. J.

At 19 °C, the rate of45Ca2+ release from MHS SR vesicles was decreased and was similar in the presence and absence of dantrolene (Fig. 1 C and Table I). These 45Ca2+release studies thus indicate that the temperature-dependent inhibitory effect of dantrolene on SR Ca2+ release that has been demonstrated in studies using intact muscle fiber preparations is also evident in studies using isolated SR vesicles.Table IEffect of dantrolene on SR 45 Ca 2+ releaseMHS 36 °CNormal 36 °CMHS 19 °CCardiac 36 °C45 Ca 2+ release, t 1/2 (s)Control1.0 ± 0.15.0 ± 1.313 ± 0.758 ± 21Dantrolene3.7 ± 0.416 ± 1.416 ± 3.057 ± 8.545Ca2+ release was determined as described under 舠Experimental Procedures舡 in the absence or presence of 10 ॖm dantrolene.

Times at which SR vesicles released half of their Ca2+ stores are based on fits to the data presented in Figs. 1 and 6 (means ± S.E. of three separate determinations). Ryanodine binds with high-affinity to the open state of RYR channels and changes in [3H]ryanodine binding that occur in the presence of RYR effectors provide a useful index of changes in RYR channel activity (21Meissner G. El-Hashem A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 114: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The effects of dantrolene on SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding were examined to determine if the demonstrated effects on SR Ca2+ release were attributable to specific effects on RYR1 channels and to obtain detailed information on the concentration-dependence of dantrolene inhibition. These experiments were performed in the same medium used in the 45Ca2+ release studies except that the concentration of MgCl2 was lowered from 3.0 to 2.7 mm to increase the SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding signal. In the absence of dantrolene, the [3H]ryanodine binding activity of MHS SR vesicles was approximately 4-fold greater than that of normal SR vesicles (Fig. 2). [3H]Ryanodine binding to both MHS and normal SR vesicles was inhibited by dantrolene, consistent with an inhibitory effect of the drug on the functional activity of RYR1 channels. The concentration-dependence of dantrolene inhibition was monophasic, with maximal inhibition at dantrolene concentrations in the therapeutic range (3–30 ॖm). Calculated K i values for dantrolene inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding were similar for MHS (130 ± 32 nm) and normal (150 ± 18 nm) SR vesicles, suggesting that sensitivity to dantrolene was not affected by the MHS RYR1 mutation (Fig. 2,inset). To investigate the pharmacological specificity of dantrolene inhibition, the effects of the dantrolene analogues aminodantrolene and azumolene were also evaluated. [3H]Ryanodine binding to MHS SR vesicles was inhibited by both analogues (Fig.3). However, inhibition by aminodantrolene required concentrations greater than 3 ॖm, whereas azumolene was a much more potent inhibitor (K i = 84 ± 24 nm). The data in Figs. 2 and 3 thus indicate that dantrolene and its analogues inhibited skeletal muscle RYR activity with distinct potencies (azumolene ≥ dantrolene ≫ aminodantrolene). The maximal inhibitory effect of the different analogues was similar, however, and the extent of inhibition was never complete (∼407 of activity in the absence of drug). In addition, in media containing dantrolene (2 ॖm), azumolene (30 nm to 30 ॖm) did not further inhibit SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 3,filled circles). These results indicate that dantrolene and its analogues may act at a common saturable site and that saturation of this site does not fully inhibit RYR1 channel activity. Previous studies have demonstrated that MHS RYR1 channels exhibit an increased activation by Ca2+(22Fill M. Coronado R. Mickelson J.R. Vilven J. Ma J. Jacobson B.A. Louis C.F. Biophys. J. 1990; 50: 471-475Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and CaM (23O'Driscoll S. McCarthy T.V. Eichinger H.M. Erhardt W. Lehmann-Horn F. Herrmann-Frank A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that an altered regulation of RYR1 channels by these physiologic effectors may underlie defects in Ca2+ homeostasis and E-C coupling in MHS muscle. We therefore investigated the effect of dantrolene on Ca2+- and CaM-activated [3H]ryanodine binding to MHS and normal SR vesicles. The Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding to MHS and normal SR vesicles was determined in media containing 1 ॖm CaM (Fig.4 A). Ca2+activation of [3H]ryanodine binding was biphasic, and the maximal extent of Ca2+ activation was approximately 2.3-fold greater for MHS than for normal SR vesicles. In addition, the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of binding to MHS SR vesicles was shifted to lower Ca2+ concentrations; thus the half-maximally activating Ca2+ concentration (K a) for MHS SR vesicles was approximately one-third of that for normal SR vesicles (TableII). In the presence of 10 ॖm dantrolene, the maximal Ca2+-activated [3H]ryanodine binding to both MHS and normal SR was decreased (Fig. 4 A) and the K a for Ca2+ was increased 2.4–3-fold (Table II).Table IIEffect of dantrolene on SR [ 3 H]ryanodine bindingMHSNormalCardiacK a Ca 2+ (nm)Control120 ± 50330 ± 62980 ± 180Dantrolene300 ± 76790 ± 821200 ± 340K a CaM (nm)Control12 ± 2.716 ± 3.4NDDantrolene16 ± 5.7NDND[3H]Ryanodine binding was determined as described under 舠Experimental Procedures舡 in the absence or presence of 10 ॖm dantrolene.

Open table in a new tab [3H]Ryanodine binding was determined as described under 舠Experimental Procedures舡 in the absence or presence of 10 ॖm dantrolene. Half-maximally activating concentrations of Ca2+ and calmodulin are based on fits of the data presented in Figs. 4 and 6 to the Hill equation. ND, not determined due to insufficient activation by CaM. The CaM dependence of activation of MHS and normal SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding was examined in media containing 100 nm Ca2+ (Fig. 4 B). CaM activation of SR [3H]ryanodine binding was monophasic and was maximal at physiologic CaM concentrations (∼1 ॖm) (24Klee C.B. Vanaman T.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 213-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). MHS and normal SR vesicles exhibited a marked difference in the extent of CaM activation; thus, maximal CaM-activated [3H]ryanodine binding to MHS SR vesicles was approximately 3.7-fold greater than to normal SR vesicles (Fig.4 B). In contrast, the half-maximally activating CaM concentration for MHS and normal SR vesicles CaM were similar (K a ∼15 nm, Table II). Dantrolene (10 ॖm) markedly reduced the maximal CaM activation of both MHS and normal SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig.4 B); however, the K a for CaM activation was unaffected by dantrolene (Table II). To determine if dantrolene inhibition of RYR1 channels in these skeletal muscle SR vesicle preparations may be attributable to a direct action of dantrolene on the RYR1 channel complex, RYR1 protein was isolated from solubilized skeletal muscle SR vesicles and reconstituted into liposomes. Sucrose gradient fractions in which RYR1 was the major protein present were identified by electrophoretic analysis (Fig.5 A), and RYR1-containing proteoliposomes prepared from these fractions exhibited a greater than 12-fold enrichment of [3H]ryanodine binding capacity in comparison to skeletal muscle SR vesicle preparations (舠Experimental Procedures舡). As reported previously (18Shomer N.H. Louis C.F. Fill M. Litterer L.A. Mickelson J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 264: C125-C135Crossref Google Scholar), following isolation and reconstitution, the MHS RYR1 retained an increased [3H]ryanodine binding activity relative to the normal RYR1 (Fig. 5 B). [3H]Ryanodine binding to both MHS and normal RYR1-containing proteoliposomes was completely inhibited by the RYR channel blocker ruthenium red (10 ॖm). Dantrolene (10 ॖm) also inhibited proteoliposome [3H]ryanodine binding (p < 0.005 for both MHS and normal), although as in the SR vesicle studies (Fig. 2), inhibition by dantrolene was incomplete. Furthermore, a lower dantrolene concentration (0.2 ॖm) was approximately half as effective as 10 ॖm dantrolene in inhibiting proteoliposome [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig.5 B). Thus the isolated, reconstituted skeletal muscle RYR1 protein displayed a sensitivity to inhibition by dantrolene that was similar to that of RYR1 in native SR vesicle preparations (Fig. 2). To determine if dantrolene inhibition was selective for the skeletal muscle RYR1 channel isoform, the effects of dantrolene on cardiac muscle SR vesicle45Ca2+ release and [3H]ryanodine binding were also examined. These experiments were performed in the same media as the corresponding skeletal muscle SR vesicle studies (Figs. 1 and 4) and indicated that under these conditions cardiac RYR2 and skeletal RYR1 channels may exhibit previously undescribed differences in their activation by Ca2+ and CaM. Accordingly, Fig. 6 A shows that in the presence of 100 nm Ca2+, the rate of 45Ca2+ release from cardiac SR vesicles was slow in comparison with that of skeletal muscle SR vesicles (Fig. 1 and Table I). Similarly, [3H]ryanodine binding to cardiac SR vesicle was not significantly activated at a Ca2+concentration of 100 nm (Fig. 6 B). Thus, in comparison with skeletal muscle SR vesicles (Fig. 4 A), the apparent threshold for Ca2+ activation of cardiac SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding was higher (Fig.6 B), and the K a for Ca2+activation of binding was shifted to the right (K a = 980 nm Ca2+ for cardiac SR versus330 nm Ca2+ for normal skeletal muscle SR, Table II). Because CaM activation accounted for the major fraction of skeletal muscle SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding at submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 4), it is possible that CaM contributed to the observed differences in the Ca2+activation of cardiac and skeletal muscle SR [3H]ryanodine binding. Consistent with this possibility, cardiac SR [3H]ryanodine binding was not significantly activated by CaM (Fig. 6 C), in marked contrast to the activating effect of CaM on skeletal muscle SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, neither cardiac SR vesicle 45Ca2+ release nor cardiac SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding were significantly affected by dantrolene (Fig. 6). Although numerous agents are known to affect the in vitro activity of RYR channels (25Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar), the effects of dantrolene on these channels are of particular interest for at least two reasons. First, dantrolene is among the most potent and selective modulators of skeletal muscle E-C coupling, and its effects on the voltage-dependent activation of skeletal muscle contraction have been well described (1Ward A. Chaffman M.O. Sorkin E.M. Drugs. 1986; 32: 130-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 3Hainaut K. Desmedt J.E. Nature. 1974; 252: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 4Morgan K.G. Bryant S.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1977; 201: 138-147PubMed Google Scholar). Second, dantrolene is perhaps the only RYR modulator used clinically, and its efficacy in preventing and reversing the pathophysiology of MH in both patients and experimental animals are well established (1Ward A. Chaffman M.O. Sorkin E.M. Drugs. 1986; 32: 130-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 8Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus it is considered that a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanism of dantrolene action may not only provide insights into the in vivo mechanisms controlling RYR1 channels during skeletal muscle E-C coupling but also help to clarify the ways in which these mechanisms may be altered in MH. Notwithstanding the clear and specific effects of dantrolene on skeletal muscle Ca2+ regulation in patients and in intact muscle fiber preparations, attempts to define its effects on RYR1 channels in more isolated preparations have to date yielded results that are inconsistent and inconclusive. For example, whereas some investigators have reported no effect of dantrolene on SR vesicle45Ca2+ release and [3H]ryanodine binding (12Palnitkar S.S. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Parness J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Louis C.F. Zualkernan K. Roghair T. Mickelson J.R. Anesthesiology. 1992; 77: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Bull R. Marengo J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C391-C396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), others have reported inhibitory effects but at dantrolene concentrations that have typically exceeded those required to inhibit the contractility of intact muscle (28El-Hayek R. Parness J. Valdivia H.H. Coronado R. Hogan K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Tian Q. Katz A.M. Kim D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Danko S. Kim D.H. Sreter F.A. Ikemoto N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 816: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Most recently, it was reported that RYR1 channels in planar lipid bilayer were either activated or inhibited by dantrolene, depending on the dantrolene concentration (14Nelson T.E. Lin M. Zapata-Sudo G. Sudo R.T. Anesthesiology. 1996; 84: 1368-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In interpreting these various reports, it therefore remains unclear if the described effects of dantrolene on RYR channels have provided a meaningful reflection of the physiologic and therapeutic actions of the drug in intact muscle. Consequently, the molecular mechanism and locus of dantrolene action have remained undefined. In this study, we have further examined the effects of dantrolene on SR vesicle 45Ca2+release and [3H]ryanodine binding using media that mimicked physiologic conditions in regard to temperature, ionic composition, and concentrations of RYR effectors. These conditions revealed a selective, monophasic inhibition of skeletal muscle RYR1 channels by dantrolene concentrations in the therapeutic range. Accordingly, inhibition of skeletal muscle SR [3H]ryanodine binding by dantrolene was maximal at 3–30 ॖm, and the concentration dependence of inhibition suggested action at a discrete high-affinity dantrolene site (K i ∼150 nm) (Fig. 2). Physiologically active analogues of dantrolene also inhibited skeletal muscle SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 3), and the relative potency of the different analogues reflected their potency in inhibiting skeletal muscle contractility (31Dhillon D.S. Pong S.F. Moorehead T.J. Drug Dev. Res. 1992; 25: 161-169Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 32Allen P.D. Lopez J.R. Sanchez V. Ryan J.F. Sreter F.A. Anesthesiology. 1992; 76: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 33Snyder H.R. Davis S.S. Bickerton R.K. Halliday R.P. J. Med. Chem. 1967; 10: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, dantrolene inhibition of skeletal muscle SR vesicle45Ca2+ release (Fig. 1) exhibited a temperature dependence that was in agreement with the temperature dependence of dantrolene inhibition demonstrated in muscle fiber preparations from pigs (19Ohta T. Endo M. Nakano T. Morohoshi Y. Wanikawa K. Ohga A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C358-C367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rats (4Morgan K.G. Bryant S.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1977; 201: 138-147PubMed Google Scholar), and guinea pigs (20Ohta T. Ito S. Ohga A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 178: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our observations thus demonstrate inhibitory effects of dantrolene on skeletal muscle RYR1 channels that are consistent with the actions of dantrolene on Ca2+ regulation in intact skeletal muscle. In contrast to these inhibitory effects on the functional activity of skeletal muscle RYR1 channels, dantrolene did not significantly affect cardiac SR vesicle 45Ca2+ release or [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 6). These findings are again consistent with the actions of dantrolene in vivo in that any effects of dantrolene on cardiac contractility are mild in comparison with effects on skeletal muscle, require higher concentrations of dantrolene, and can be attributed to effects of dantrolene at sites other than the cardiac SR (1Ward A. Chaffman M.O. Sorkin E.M. Drugs. 1986; 32: 130-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 5Van Winkle W.B. Science. 1976; 193: 1130-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 7Fratea S. Langeron O. Lecarpentier Y. Coria P. Riou B. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our findings further indicate that the selective effect of dantrolene on skeletal muscle E-C coupling in vivo likely reflects a selective action of dantrolene at skeletal (RYR1) as compared with cardiac (RYR2) isoforms of the Ca2+ release channel. Whether action at RYR1 channels may also account for the effects of dantrolene in certain non-muscle cells (e.g. central neurons, Refs. 16Mody I. MacDonald J.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 356-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 34Frandsen A. Schousboe A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2590-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) is not yet clear. Parness and co-workers (11Parness J. Palnitkar S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18465-18472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Palnitkar S.S. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Parness J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have identified a specific, high-affinity [3H]dantrolene binding site in skeletal muscle SR vesicle preparations and have suggested that this site may reside either on the RYR1 channel itself or on some separate but closely associated regulatory molecule in the SR membrane. The possibility that dantrolene may bind to a receptor distinct from the RYR1 was supported by data which indicated that SR vesicle [3H]dantrolene binding was unaffected by both pharmacological modulators of RYR channels and by the RYR1 mutation associated with porcine MH (11Parness J. Palnitkar S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18465-18472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Palnitkar S.S. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Parness J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, peaks of [3H]dantrolene and [3H]ryanodine binding observed following fractionation of unsolubilized SR vesicles were consistent with the possibility that receptors for dantrolene and ryanodine may be present on overlapping but distinct vesicle populations (12Palnitkar S.S. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Parness J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine if the inhibitory effects of dantrolene on RYR1 activity that we observed may depend on dantrolene binding to a non-RYR1 receptor, SR vesicles were solubilized and RYR1 protein was isolated on sucrose gradients. Following reconstitution into liposomes, the isolated RYR1 protein displayed a sensitivity to dantrolene comparable with that of RYR1 in native SR (Fig. 5). This result strongly suggests that the mechanism of dantrolene inhibition does not require dantrolene binding to a receptor that is distinct and easily separable from RYR1 but rather involves a direct interaction of dantrolene with the RYR1 channel complex. Inhibition of RYR1 channels by dantrolene was associated with clear and pronounced effects on the activation of these channels by CaM. Dantrolene decreased the maximal extent of CaM-activated [3H]ryanodine binding by more than half (Fig.4 B) but did not affect the K a for CaM activation (Table II). This result suggests a noncompetitive inhibition of CaM activation by dantrolene; that is, rather than competing at a CaM activation site on the RYR1 channel, dantrolene may allosterically reduce the fraction of channels that may be activated by CaM. Dantrolene also decreased the maximal extent of Ca2+-activated [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig.4 A) and shifted the apparent K a for Ca2+ activation to higher Ca2+ concentrations (Table II). Notably, the effects of dantrolene on the parameters of RYR1 activation by both CaM and Ca2+ opposed the effects of the MHS RYR1 mutation on channel activation by these effectors. This suggests that dantrolene may inhibit RYR1 channels via a mechanism that selectively counteracts the functional consequences of the MHS Arg615 → Cys mutation. Fig.7 incorporates the observed effects of dantrolene on RYR1 channels into a simple model of RYR1 activation during E-C coupling in MHS and normal muscle (36El-Hayek R. Yano M. Antoniu B. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Ikemoto N. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1381-C1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The model postulates that RYR1 channels may exist in alternative closed states that differ in their sensitivity to activation by CaM and Ca2+. Dantrolene is postulated to increase the stability of the insensitive (Closed i) state, thereby reproducing the observed decrease in the fraction of channels that may be activated by CaM and Ca2+ in the presence of dantrolene (i.e.noncompetitive inhibition, Fig. 4). Conversely, the MHS Arg615 → Cys mutation is postulated to increase the stability of the sensitive (Closed s) state, thereby reproducing the observed increase in the fraction of MHS channels that may be activated by CaM and Ca2+ (Fig. 4; Refs. 22Fill M. Coronado R. Mickelson J.R. Vilven J. Ma J. Jacobson B.A. Louis C.F. Biophys. J. 1990; 50: 471-475Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 23O'Driscoll S. McCarthy T.V. Eichinger H.M. Erhardt W. Lehmann-Horn F. Herrmann-Frank A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The model further postulates that transitions between theClosed i and Closed sstates may be controlled by depolarization (ΔV) acting through the transverse tubule voltage sensor. In this way, the model reproduces the opposing effects of dantrolene and the Arg615 → Cys mutation on the voltage dependence of activation that have been documented in studies using intact muscle fibers (4Morgan K.G. Bryant S.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1977; 201: 138-147PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jong D.S. Stroffekova K. Heiny J.A. J. Physiol. 1997; 499: 787-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 37Gallant E.M. Gronert G.A. Taylor S.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1982; 28: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 38Dietze B. Eichinger H.M. Erhardt W. Melzer W. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: A273Google Scholar). Thus the model suggests that voltage and Ca2+/CaM may not activate RYR1 channels via readily separable mechanisms, but rather through a common mechanism, termed voltage-dependent Ca2+-induced Ca2+release. The model thereby predicts that while RYR1 activation may be controlled by voltage, it may nevertheless display sensitivity to Ca2+ and to various effectors of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (39Anderson K. Meissner G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 363-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Suda N. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5725-5729Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In such a mechanism, CaM may be a particularly critical effector, as CaM remains constitutively bound to RYR1 and effectively shifts the threshold for Ca2+activation to resting Ca2+ concentrations (41Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Thus CaM activation might contribute to a hallmark of skeletal muscle E-C coupling, i.e. rapid activation via a mechanism that operates in the absence of an initial increase in myoplasmic Ca2+ (42Schneider M.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 463-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory has suggested that, whereas RYR1 channels exhibit changeable Ca2+ activation properties, cardiac RYR2 channels appear to exhibit a more consistent Ca2+-activable state (43Fruen B.R. Kane P.K. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2522-2530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In terms of the present model (Fig. 7), RYR2 channels are thus postulated to exhibit a more stableClosed s state, and the lack of an effect of dantrolene on cardiac SR may be interpreted as a reflection of the increased stability of this state for the RYR2 isoform. Alternatively, the lack of an effect of dantrolene on cardiac SR may reflect the lack of a high-affinity dantrolene binding site on the RYR2 isoform. An additional observation from the present studies was that in contrast to RYR1 channels, RYR2 channels were not activated by physiological CaM (Fig. 6 C). This apparent difference in regulation by CaM may therefore represent an important and previously undescribed functional difference between the RYR1 and RYR2 isoforms. Indeed, if CaM is necessary for RYR1 activation at resting Ca2+concentrations (above), then the absence of CaM activation of RYR2 would be consistent with a hallmark of cardiac E-C coupling,i.e. activation via a mechanism that is strictly dependent on an initial increase in Ca2+. In evaluating our model, it will be important to verify differences in the functional interaction of CaM with cardiac and skeletal muscle RYR isoforms. In addition, it will be important to compare the functional consequences of other human MHS RYR1 mutations with those of the Arg615 → Cys mutation (44Richter M. Schleithoff L. Deufel T. Lehmann-Horn F. Hermann-Frank A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5256-5260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), as the model predicts that rather than altering particular ligand binding sites, MH mutations may affect a global conformational transition in the RYR1 channel that is controlled by transverse tubule depolarization and results in increased channel activation by CaM and Ca2+. Finally, it will be useful to further define the molecular mechanism of action of RYR-isoform-specific modulators of E-C coupling, such as dantrolene. We thank P. Kane for valuable technical assistance and Drs. G. Strasburg, E. Gallant, E. Balog, J. Parness, and S. Palnitkar for helpful discussions."

In most eukaryotes, the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine has been well understood for many years (1Bender D.A. Amino Acid Metabolism. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1975Google Scholar). The first step is a transamination in which α-ketoglutarate accepts the amino group (from leucine, isoleucine, and valine) producing glutamate and α-ketoisocaproic acid, α-keto-ॆ-methylvaleric acid and α-ketoisovaleric acid, respectively. Next is oxidative decarboxylation of the keto acids by branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase to the corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives. Further steps yield, ultimately, acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate (from leucine), acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA (from isoleucine), and succinyl-CoA (from valine). All of these metabolites can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) 1The abbreviations used are: TCA, tricarboxylic acid; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; GC, gas chromatography; GC-MS, combined sequential gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. 1The abbreviations used are: TCA, tricarboxylic acid; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; GC, gas chromatography; GC-MS, combined sequential gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. cycle. It has been known for many years that yeasts do not operate the same metabolic routes because branched-chain amino acids can serve as the sole source of nitrogen but not carbon (2Cooper T.G. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 39-99Google Scholar, 3Large P.J. Yeast. 1986; 2: 1-34Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The predominant view, in a rather sparse literature, is that yeasts first use transamination but that decarboxylation of the keto acids proceeds via a 舠carboxylase舡 to an aldehyde that is then reduced in an NADH-linked reaction producing the appropriate 舠fusel舡 alcohol (2Cooper T.G. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 39-99Google Scholar, 3Large P.J. Yeast. 1986; 2: 1-34Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Derrick S. Large P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2783-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This scheme is sometimes called the 舠Ehrlich pathway舡 to honor the originator of the ideas (5Ehrlich F. Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. 1907; 40: 1027-1047Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which were slightly modified later (6Neubauer O. Fromherz K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1911; 70: 326-350Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Acceptance of the so-called Ehrlich pathway is problematical for at least four reasons. First, the supposed pathway has never been proven to exist. Simply showing that e.g. radioactively labeled leucine is converted into isoamyl alcohol does not prove that the individual steps are those envisaged in the scheme. Other routes are conceivable. The wrongly named carboxylase (which should at least be called a 舠decarboxylase舡) has never been isolated; a few authors assume that pyruvate decarboxylase is responsible (4Derrick S. Large P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2783-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), without proof. The second problem is that this scheme cannot explain all of the products that yeast makes; some fusel alcohols do not correspond to any known amino acid. Third, even if the pathway did exist as envisaged by Webb and Ingraham (7Webb A.D. Ingraham J.L. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1963; 5: 317-353Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the production of fusel alcohols in this manner would require a mixing of the synthetic and degradative reactions involving the branched-chain amino acids. This is something that cells normally avoid by coordinate regulation. Synthetic enzymes are usually repressed and/or inhibited if the end product is present. Conversely, catabolic enzymes are not induced if the compound is being synthesized at rates that are satisfying biosynthetic demand. Furthermore, if this unusual situation did exist, then operation of the metabolic pathways would require some extraordinary channeling of metabolites between different subcellular compartments. Fourth, the Ehrlich pathway does not explain all of the known facts as Ehrlich himself was fully aware. Two of the most serious concerns are that the kinetics of amino acid utilization do not match fusel alcohol formation in complex media, and in media containing low levels of amino acids, there is a poor correlation between the amino acid composition and the composition of the resulting fusel oil (7Webb A.D. Ingraham J.L. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1963; 5: 317-353Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recent examination of the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae confirms that the first step is transamination. There is an aminotransferase specific to branched-chain amino acids that is encoded by a single gene called BAA1(8Dickinson J.R. Norte V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase has also been demonstrated in this yeast (9Dickinson J.R. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2029-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This enzyme is distinct from both α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase because it could not be detected in assay conditions that permitted the measurement of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and vice versa. Also, a strain lacking α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase due to a deletion and disruption of the KGD1 coding sequence and another strain lacking pyruvate dehydrogenase due to a disruption of the gene encoding the E1α sububunit of that latter enzyme both retained branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase activity (9Dickinson J.R. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2029-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase has been purified fromS. cerevisiae, and a number of its properties have been characterized (10Sinclair D.A. Dawes I.W. Dickinson J.R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 911-922PubMed Google Scholar). Our experience with 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for metabolic analysis in wild-type and mutant yeast (11Dickinson J.R. Dawes I.W.

Sobanski M.A. Hewlins M.J.E. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) led us to use this technique to determine the metabolic pathways used in fusel alcohol formation from branched-chain amino acids. This paper reports the catabolism of leucine to isoamyl alcohol. The strains used are shown in Table I. Strains JRD815–1.2 and JRD815–6.1 were constructed by mating YSH5.127.-17C to FY1679-YDL080c(α) and sporulation of the resultant diploid. Standard genetic techniques were used in the strain construction (15Sherman F. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 11: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Mortimer R.K. Hawthorn D.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 11: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Progeny segregating all three pdc mutations were identified by a failure to grow on glucose-containing media and by enzyme assays; segregation of the disrupted YDL080c gene was followed by the ability to grow in the presence of the antibiotic G418 (Geneticin, at 200 ॖg/ml). Starter cultures were grown in a medium comprising 17 yeast extract, 27 Bacto-peptone, and 27 carbon source. For studies of leucine catabolism, cells were grown in minimal medium containing (per liter) 1.67 g of yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 20 g of leucine, and either 20 ml of ethanol or 20 g of glucose for the carbon source. Experiments involving 13C labeling used [2-13C]leucine (99.9 atom 7) from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Cambridge, MA). Auxotrophic requirements were supplied as required at 20 ॖg/ml. Liquid cultures were grown in conical flasks filled to 407 nominal capacity in a gyrorotatory shaker. Agar (27) was used to solidify media.

Signals were identified by comparison with spectra of standard compounds recorded under identical conditions and confirmed by 舠spiking舡 (addition of small amounts of the bona fide compounds to experimental samples). Standard Bruker software (UXNMR) was used throughout. Chemical shifts (∂, ppm) are reported relative to external tetramethylsilane in C2HCl3; addition of sodium trimethylsilylpropanesulfonate gave a methyl signal at −2.6 ppm under the conditions used here. In preliminary experiments isoamyl alcohol was determined in degassed culture supernatants by gas chromatography (GC) using a 2-m precolumn (0.53 mm internal diameter) of fused silica connected to a 60-m (0.53 mm internal diameter) megabore DBWAX column with a flame ionization detector. The temperature of the injector and the detector was 250 °C; the oven temperature was increased from 50 to 150 °C over 5 min; helium (11 p.s.i.) was used as carrier gas. Standard solutions (0–250 ppm, w/v) of isoamyl alcohol were prepared in chilled 47 (v/v) ethanol. Later experiments used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on a 30-m (0.32 mm internal diameter) fused silica capillary column with a 0.25-ॖm film of Supelcowax 10 (Supelco). The GC was a Hewlett Packard 5890, the mass spectrometer was a Trio-1 quadrupole mass spectrometer (VG, now named Finnigan, Altrincham, UK). The injector temperature was 250 °C, and the samples were chromatographed isothermally at 60 °C; helium (8 p.s.i.) was the carrier gas. Isoamyl alcohol (3-methyl-1-butanol) and active amyl alcohol (2-methyl-1-butanol) had almost identical retention times but could be discriminated because the former produced a unique ion of mass = 55 Da, which the latter completely lacked. Standard solutions of isoamyl alcohol gave a linear calibration over the range 0–500 ppm. Comparable experimental results were obtained with the two techniques. Cells were harvested by filtration on cellulose acetate membranes (0.45 ॖm pore size), washed with copious amounts of sterile distilled water, resuspended in ice-cold buffer B (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and disrupted using a Braun homogenizer as described previously (17Dickinson J.R. Williams A.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 133: 135-140Google Scholar). Cell homogenate was used immediately as a source of enzyme. Pyruvate decarboxylase was determined as described by Schmitt and Zimmermann (18Schmitt H.D. Zimmermann F.K. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-Ketoisocaproate reductase was assayed at 25 °C in 1 ml of buffer B containing 0.2 mm NADH. The reaction was initiated by the addition of α-ketoisocaproate. NADH 舠disappearance舡 was monitored by following the absorbance at 340 nm in a dual beam recording spectrophotometer. The assay blank contained all components except α-ketoisocaproate. Attempts were also made to assay the reaction in the reverse direction using either l- ordl-α-hydroxyisocaproate (2–5 mm) and NAD, FAD, or NADP (each tried at 0.1–0.4 mm). When cell extracts were examined for the ability to convert individual α-keto acids into isoamyl alcohol in vitro, approximately 5 mg of protein was incubated at 30 °C with 1–2 mg of α-keto acid in 1 ml of buffer B with or without thiamine pyrophosphate (0.2 ॖmol), NAD (0.765 ॖmol), or Coenzyme A (0.08 ॖmol). Apart from when the contents of the tubes were re-mixed (every 10 min to prevent settling), the lids of the tubes were kept open in case there was a requirement for oxygen. After 1 h, the tubes were centrifuged for 3 min in a microfuge, and the supernatants were removed and filtered through a 0.22-ॖm filter. They were then stored at −20 °C for no more than 18 h or analyzed immediately by GC-MS as described above. Fig.1 shows the 13C NMR spectrum of a culture supernatant of a wild-type strain that had been cultured in a minimal medium in which ethanol was the carbon source and [2-13C]leucine was the sole nitrogen source. The largest signal was C-2 of leucine at 53.5 ppm (the 13C-labeled substrate). A number of resonances were observed due to natural abundance: leucine C-1 (at 175.5 ppm appearing as a doublet J = 54 Hz due to the adjacent labeled C-2), leucine C-3 (at 39.8 ppm as a doublet J = 33 Hz due to the adjacent labeled C-2), leucine C-4 (24.0 ppm), leucine C-5 (20.8 ppm), leucine C-6 (21.8 ppm), ethanol C-1 (57.5 ppm), and ethanol C-2 (16.8 ppm). The other resonances that were clearly visible were C-2 of α-ketoisocaproate (207.7 ppm), C-1 of isovalerate (179.3 ppm), C-2 of α-hydroxyisocaproate (70.0 ppm), and C-1 of isoamyl alcohol (60.2 ppm). From the metabolites identified and the positions that were labeled with 13C, a number of routes between leucine and isoamyl alcohol seemed possible. All of these involved initial transamination to α-ketoisocaproate (Fig.2). The first was via branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (route A in Fig. 2) to yield isovaleryl-CoA, which would then be converted to isovalerate by acyl-CoA hydrolase. The second possibility was via pyruvate decarboxylase (route B). Potential pathway Cinvolved α-ketoisocaproate reductase to produce α-hydroxyisocaproate followed by decarboxylation to yield isoamyl alcohol. The possibility was considered that isovalerate was derived from α-hydroxyisocaproate. Route D envisaged a pyruvate decarboxylase-like enzyme. Although pathway E was included as a theoretical possibility, we could not conceive a metabolic route in yeast between α-ketoisocaproate and isovalerate using known or potential enzymes so the notion was discarded. Subsequent experiments were devised to distinguish between the four remaining possibilities.Figure 2Potential metabolic routes for the metabolism of leucine to isoamyl alcohol.

Dickinson J.R. Danner D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this defect, the strain lacks pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, glycine carboxylase, and branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (20Dickinson J.R. Roy D.J. Dawes I.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Sinclair D.A. Dawes I.W. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1213-1222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lanterman M.M. Dickinson J.R. Danner D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Since strain MML22 lacks branched-chain α-keto acid deydrogenase, it offered a way of testing whether this activity is required for the formation of isoamyl alcohol from leucine. Since lpd1 mutants do not grow on non-fermentable carbon sources (19Lanterman M.M. Dickinson J.R. Danner D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Dickinson J.R. Roy D.J. Dawes I.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Reptto B. Tzagoloff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3931-3939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), strain MML22 was cultured in minimal medium comprising glucose as carbon source and leucine as sole source of nitrogen. Under these conditions culture supernatants of MML22 contained isoamyl alcohol (Table II). This indicates that branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (or any of the other mitochondrial keto acid dehydrogenase complexes) is not required for the formation of isoamyl alcohol.Table IIAmount of isoamyl alcohol produced by various strains growing in glucose minimal medium with leucine as sole source of nitrogenStrainRelevant genotypeIsoamyl alcoholIsoamyl alcoholॖg/mlॖg/10 6 cellsIWD72Wild type3183.4MML22lpd124512.2YSH5.127.-17C2-aStrains YSH5.127.-17C, JRD815–1.2, and JRD815–6.1 lack pyruvate decarboxylase and hence cannot utilize glucose; these had ethanol (27 v/v) as carbon source.pdc1 pdc5 pdc610889.3FY1679Wild-type5475.1FY1679-YDL080c(a)ydl080c∷Kanr1471.4FY1679-YDL080c(α)ydl080c∷Kanr1411.4JRD815–1.22-aStrains YSH5.127.-17C, JRD815–1.2, and JRD815–6.1 lack pyruvate decarboxylase and hence cannot utilize glucose; these had ethanol (27 v/v) as carbon source.pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydl080c∷Kanr631.6JRD815–6.12-aStrains YSH5.127.-17C, JRD815–1.2, and JRD815–6.1 lack pyruvate decarboxylase and hence cannot utilize glucose; these had ethanol (27 v/v) as carbon source.pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydl080c∷Kanr941.6Isoamyl alcohol content was determined in early stationary phase.

Open table in a new tab Isoamyl alcohol content was determined in early stationary phase. Values are the means of two separate experiments. Differences between samples were <47. The 13C NMR spectrum of a culture supernatant of thelpd1 mutant (Fig. 3) showed resonances due to all of the positions in leucine as before. All of the resonances of glucose were observed due to natural abundance: C-1ॆ (96.0 ppm), C-1α (92.2 ppm), C-3ॆ (76.0 ppm), C-5ॆ (75.9 ppm), C-2ॆ (74.3 ppm), C-3α (72.9 ppm), C-2α (71.6 ppm), C-5α (71.5 ppm), C-4α (69.8 ppm), C-4ॆ (69.7 ppm), C-6ॆ (60.9 ppm), and C-6α (60.7 ppm). The C-1 and C-2 of ethanol were also observed due to natural abundance. In the lpd1 mutant, they were observed due to the fermentation of glucose to ethanol; whereas in the wild-type, they were observed because ethanol was the carbon source. The resonances due to C-2 of α-ketoisocaproate and C-1 of isoamyl alcohol were also observed. There was no resonance due to isovalerate. This implies that the isovalerate produced by the wild type was derived via isovaleryl-CoA due to the action of branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase and subsequent hydrolysis by acyl-CoA hydrolase. If isovalerate had been derived from either α-ketoisocaproate or α-hydroxyisocaproate, then one would expect to see it produced by thelpd1 mutant. Three possible routes remained for the conversion of α-ketoisocaproate to isoamyl alcohol: (B) pyruvate decarboxylase, (C) reduction of α-ketoisocaproate to α-hydroxyisocaproate followed by decarboxylation of α-hydroxyisocaproate to isoamyl alcohol, or (D) a pyruvate decarboxylase-like enzyme. The mutant strain YSH5.127.-17C completely lacks pyruvate decarboxylase activity due to disruptions in all three genes for pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC1, PDC5, andPDC6) (23Hohmann S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7963-7969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strain grew as well as wild-type strains on ethanol minimal medium with leucine as sole source of nitrogen and produced large amounts of isoamyl alcohol (Table II). The very high concentration of isoamyl alcohol in the medium arises from the need for this strain to be grown with ethanol as carbon source. The wild-type strain produced similarly high concentrations when ethanol was the carbon source rather than glucose (24Dickinson J.R. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It seems reasonable to conclude from this result that pyruvate decarboxylase is not required for the formation of isoamyl alcohol from leucine. The reduction of α-ketoisocaproate to α-hydroxyisocaproate (possible pathway C) with subsequent decarboxylation presented an interesting possibility. The interconversion of α-ketoisocaproate and d-2-hydroxyisocaproate has been described in Lactobacillus casei (25Lerch H.-P. Blöcker H. Kallwass H. Hoppe J. Tsai H. Collins J. Gene. 1989; 78: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae contains three genes, YER081w on chromosomeV, YIL074c on chromosome IX, andYNL274c on chromosome XIV, substantially identical at the amino acid level to the L. casei enzyme, each of which is potentially capable of encoding such an activity. S. cerevisiae clearly possesses the ability to convert α-ketoisocaproate to α-hydroxyisocaproate using NADH as hydrogen donor (Table III). Optimal activity occurred at 6 mm α-ketoisocaproate and 0.3 mmNADH with a pH optimum at pH 7.5. It proved impossible to assay the reaction in the opposite direction using α-hydroxyisocaproate with any one of NAD, FAD, or NADP. The reductase activity appears to reside within the mitochondrion (data not shown). However, extracts prepared from cells that had been grown on ethanol minimal medium in which leucine was the sole source of nitrogen did not convert α-hydroxyisocaproate into isoamyl alcohol. Hence, the presence of α-ketoisocaproate reductase explains the presence of α-hydroxyisocaproate in spectra such as Fig. 1, but it does not appear to be relevant to the formation of isoamyl alcohol. More details on this enzyme will be published elsewhere.Table IIIα-Ketoisocaproate reductase activity in S. cerevisiaeProteinα-Ketoisocaproate[NADH]pHSpecific activityॖgmmmmnmol/min/mg protein3340.17.42.53360.27.43.53360.47.41.9 1960.36.71.6460.37.52.31560.37.54.21960.37.55.91960.38.14.1Wild-type strain IWD72 was cultured in ethanol minimal medium with leucine as nitrogen source.

Cell homogenates were prepared and assayed as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Results are the means of duplicates. Differences between samples were <67. The only feasible remaining possibility seemed to be a pyruvate decarboxylase-like activity (route D in Fig. 2). The conversion of α-ketoisocaproate to isoamyl alcohol in vitro confirms this notion (TableIV). The activity fell at α-ketoisocaproate concentrations above 7.7 mm and when extra thiamine pyrophosphate was added to the assay. The basal rates observed in vitro in extracts from cells, which had been in ethanol minimal medium with leucine as the sole nitrogen source for 63 h, satisfactorily explain the rate of accumulation of isoamyl alcohol seen in cultures at this time (Fig.4). A search of theSaccharomyces Genome data base revealed the presence of the gene YDL080c on chromosome IV, the predicted amino acid sequence of which has obviously high homology to the enzymes encoded by PDC1, PDC5, and PDC6 (Fig.5). To date, no clear biochemical identity has been ascribed to YDL080c although a pseudonym for YDL080c is THI3, which functions as a positive regulator of thiamine biosynthesis (27Nishimura H. Kawasaki Y. Kaneko Y. Nosaka K. Iwashima A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4701-4706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains FY1679-YDL080c(a) and FY1679-YDL080c(α), both of which carry a disruption in this gene, and their parent strain FY1679 do not grow in ethanol minimal medium with leucine as nitrogen source. Indeed, all three strains do not grow well even in complex medium when supplied with non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol or ethanol, indicating a reduced ability to metabolize non-fermentable carbon sources in the genetic background of the parental strain. However, FY1679 and the YDL080c disruption mutants were capable of growing in glucose minimal medium with leucine as nitrogen source with virtually identical kinetics to the prototrophic wild-type IWD72 used throughout this study (Fig. 6). It is noticeable that the strains with disruptions in YDL080cproduced very little isoamyl alcohol (Table II). Normalizing the amount of isoamyl alcohol produced for the amount of biomass present emphasizes this result (Table II.) If YDL080c were the only gene encoding the ability to decarboxylate α-ketoisocaproate, one would have expected the level of isoamyl alcohol to be zero in FY1679-YDL080c(a) and FY1679-YDL080c(α). The quadruple mutants JRD815–1.2 and JRD815–6.1, which are defective in all three pyruvate decarboxylase genes and disrupted in the open reading frameYDL080c, produced levels of isoamyl alcohol similar to those produced by strains disrupted only in YDL080c (Table II.) This indicates that the gene YDL080c encodes the major α-ketoisocaproate decarboxylase but that there must be at least one other decarboxylase that is involved in the decarboxylation of α-ketoisocaproate and the formation of isoamyl alcohol from leucine.Table IVThe in vitro conversion of α-ketoisocaproate to isoamyl alcohol by cell extractsα-Ketoisocaproate[NAD][TPP]Specific activityα-Ketoisocaproate converted to isoamyl alcoholmmmmmmng isoamyl alcohol formed/min/mg protein715.4002445.77.70034616.115.410.259713.97.700.21296Wild-type strain IWD72 was cultured for 63 h in ethanol minimal medium with leucine as sole source of nitrogen.

Differences between samples were <37. Analysis of the metabolism of [2-13C]leucine by the wild-type strain suggested four credible routes from α-ketoisocaproate to isoamyl alcohol (Fig. 2). The first was via branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase to yield isovaleryl-CoA; this thioester would then be converted to isovalerate by acyl-CoA hydrolase (ACH1 gene product), which has a broad substrate specificity including this substrate (28Lee F.-J.S. Lin L.-W. Smith J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Lee F.-J.S. Lin L.-W. Smith J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7413-7418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pathway operates in the wild type only as far as isovalerate the end product. The pathway is not used for the synthesis of isoamyl alcohol because abolition of branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase in an lpd1disruption mutant did not prevent the formation of isoamyl alcohol. The second possibility was via pyruvate decarboxylase as sugested by Derrick and Large (4Derrick S. Large P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2783-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the complete obliteration of pyruvate decarboxylase activity in a pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 triple mutant had virtually no effect on the levels of isoamyl alcohol produced. The third, and most intriguing possibility was via α-ketoisocaproate reductase, a novel activity that, as far as we are aware, has not been identified previously in S. cerevisiae. The true metabolic significance of this enzyme in yeast is not apparent at this time. It is quite clear that it has no role in the formation of isoamyl alcohol from α-hydroxyisocaproate because cell homogenates could not convert α-hydroxyisocaproate to isoamyl alcohol. Bearing in mind that this enzyme is present in L. casei, the considerable homology between the yeast and bacterial proteins, and the frequent association of S. cerevisiae and lactic acid bacteria, it is tempting to speculate that this activity was acquired from lactic acid bacteria at some time in evolutionary history. The final possibility to be examined, a pyruvate decarboxylase-like enzyme encoded byYDL080c, appears to be the major route of decarboxylation of α-ketoisocaproate to isoamyl alcohol although disruption of this gene reveals that another decarboxylase can substitute to a minor extent. The identity of this minor decarboxylase remains unknown at this time. On the basis of chromosomal location and restriction enzyme fragments,YDL080c is believed to be the same as THI3, a gene identified previously as a positive regulator of thiamine biosynthesis (27Nishimura H. Kawasaki Y. Kaneko Y. Nosaka K. Iwashima A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4701-4706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nothing more is known at present of the way in which thiamine biosynthesis is regulated by the THI3 gene product. Indeed, the pathway of thiamine biosynthesis remains to be elucidated in all organisms. Nevertheless, since α-ketoisocaproate decarboxylase is such a typical decarboxylase, has a thiamine binding site (Fig. 5, (26Hawkins C.F. Borges A. Perham R.N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar)), and will be active when a yeast cell is close to starvation, the dual role of decarboxylation and stimulation of thiamine biosynthesis would seem to be a very elegant metabolic control. Additionally, the inhibition of the enzyme by thiamine pyrophosphate observed in vitro suggests that in vivo activity would be low when thiamine was abundant, which correlates with the known low rates of formation of isoamyl alcohol in rich media (7Webb A.D. Ingraham J.L. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1963; 5: 317-353Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It seems to us that because its role as α-ketoisocaproatedecarboxylase is currently better defined than its role in regulation of thiamine biosynthesis, a more appropriate name for the open reading frame YDL080c would be KID1. InS. cerevisiae, a number of 舠ordinary housekeeping舡 enzymes have a dual role as metabolic regulators. Included in this list are the HXK2 gene product, which doubles as an isozyme of hexokinase and is also involved in carbon catabolite repression (30Trumbly R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar,31Johnston M. Carlson M. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-281Google Scholar), and PDC1, which encodes the major isozyme of pyruvate decarboxylase for growth on glucose and exerts a regulatory effect on the expression of PDC5 (32Hohmann S. Cederberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see whether mutation of different sections of the KID1(THI3) gene can identify separate portions of the protein specifically involved in either catalysis or gene regulation.

The largest of these, eIF3, is a multiprotein complex of ∼600 kDa that plays a central role in the initiation pathway. eIF3 binds to 40 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of other initiation factors and helps maintain 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits in a dissociated state. It is also believed to play important roles in the formation of the 40 S initiation complex by interacting with the ternary complex of eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNA i and in promoting mRNA binding (2Trachsel H.

Through knowledge of the sequence of these subunits and from experiments involving their cDNAs, new insights into the structure and function of eIF3 have emerged. p170 is the site of binding of eIF3 to eIF4B, thus being implicated as playing an important role in the formation of higher order complexes of initiation factors (5Méthot N.

Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1110-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but it is not known if it binds to RNA. p110 is homologous to the yeast NIP1 protein (9Asano K. Kinzy T.G. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1101-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), whose gene was isolated genetically as being involved in protein import into the nucleus (10Gu Z. Moerschell R.P. Sherman F. Goldfarb D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10355-10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although NIP1 was not found in preparations of yeast eIF3 isolated by classical biochemical fractionation techniques (11Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32286-32292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is present in eIF3 complexes isolated rapidly by using a polyhistidine-tagged subunit. 3Z. Gu, L. Phan, A. deSilva, J. R. Greenberg, C. Apolito, F. Sherman, A. G. Hinnebusch, and D. S. Goldfarb, submitted for publication. The p48 subunit is identical to a mouse protein called Int-6, whose gene is a frequent site of integration by mouse mammary tumor viruses (12Marchetti A. Buttitta F. Miyazaki S. Gallahan D. Smith G.H. Callahan R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that eIF3-p48 may control eIF3 activity and thus translation and thereby possibly affect growth regulation. p36 has a prominent WD-40 repeat signature that implies a role in formation of a multiprotein complex, an idea strengthened by the observation that its yeast homolog, eIF3-p39, is essential for the stability and maintenance of the yeast eIF3 complex (13Naranda T. Kainuma M. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Of the five subunits whose cDNAs have been cloned and sequenced to date, all but p48 have homologous genes inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. We have therefore turned our attention to the cloning and characterization of cDNAs encoding the remaining five subunits of eIF3. The rapidly growing data base of partial cDNA sequences, called expressed sequence tags (ESTs), is liberating researchers from cDNA screening with either antibodies or radiolabeled DNA probes. Rather, one can search the EST data base for matches to partial amino acid sequences derived from the protein of interest. In this report, we describe the isolation and sequencing of cDNAs encoding the p66, p47, and p40 subunits of eIF3 primarily by using this strategy. The cloning and characterization of p44 and p35 cDNAs is in progress and will be reported elsewhere. eIF3 was prepared from human HeLa cells and rabbit reticulocytes essentially as described previously (14Brown-Luedi M. Meyer L.J. Milburn S.C. Yau P.M.-P. Corbett S. Hershey J.W.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4202-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 108-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antiserum against rabbit eIF3 was prepared in a goat and characterized previously (16Meyer L.J. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4206-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Standard recombinant DNA techniques (17Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) were used. Affinity purification of anti-eIF3 antibodies and methods for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were described previously (9Asano K. Kinzy T.G. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1101-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Internal peptide sequences of the p66, p47, and p40 subunits of rabbit reticulocyte eIF3 were obtained by trypsin digestion of the corresponding protein obtained by SDS-PAGE, HPLC purification, and sequencing, all essentially as described (18Aebersold R.H. Leavitt J. Saavedra R.A. Hood L.E. Kent S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6970-6974Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Internal peptide sequences of HeLa eIF3-p47 were obtained after Lys-C digestion in the gel, HPLC fractionation, and sequencing at the Protein Structure Laboratory (University of California, Davis). The peptide sequences are reported in Table I. Sequences in the EST data base that match the internal amino acid sequences were sought in the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base by using the BLAST (GCG, Madison, WI) program.Table IPeptide sequence analyses of eIF3 subunit polypeptideseIF3 SubunitPeptide sequences1-aAmbiguous residues are in parentheses, with alternative possibilities indicated following the slash.

Open table in a new tab The rabbit peptide sequence from p66 matches 15 of 17 residues in the human EST clone 67165 (accession number T56803). Clone 67165 DNA inserted at the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pBluescript SK+ was obtained from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Livermore, CA), was sequenced on both strands, and was renamed pBS67165. The 1202-bp insert encodes the 347 C-terminal amino acid residues of putative p66 and exhibits 537 sequence identity to a portion of a 64.2-kDa Caenorhabditis elegans protein encoded by cosmid clone R08D7_3 (accession number Z12017). The amino acid sequence of R08D7_3 protein was then used in additional BLAST searches of the EST data base, and four overlapping human ESTs (T3564,T32034, T32020, T32801) were found that encode related proteins with 40–537 sequence identity to the N-terminal region of R08D7_3. One of these clones, 102366 (T32020), with the DNA inserted into theEcoRI/XhoI sites of pBluescript SK+, was purchased from ATCC. The plasmid was named pBSp66, and the 1867-bp cDNA insert was sequenced on both strands by generating deletions with HindIII, which cleaves the insert both at 0.5 and 0.75 kb from the 5′-end, and by using custom-made primers. The 3′-terminal portion of the sequence matches perfectly that of clone 67165, and the full-length cDNA encodes a putative protein with a mass of 63.9 kDa. The cDNA sequence in pBSp66 was deposited in GenBankTM as human eIF3-p66 cDNA (accession numberU54558). Two rabbit peptide sequences matched the human EST clone 61212 (accession number T39801) at 10 of 12 and at 9 of 11 residues. The DNA was obtained from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Livermore, CA) and was sequenced on both strands. The 797-bp insert encodes a C-terminal open reading frame (ORF) with 214 amino acid residues and was used to screen a λZAP human liver cDNA library (Stratagene). Two positive clones were isolated from 6 × 105 phages and the cDNA portions were excisedin vivo. One, named pBSp47–17, carries a 1211-bp insert, which was sequenced on both strands by making BclI deletions (BclI cleaves the cDNA at 0.7 kb from the 5′-end) and by using custom-made primers. pBSp47–17 contains a C-terminal 352 codon ORF but lacks an apparent ATG initiation codon. To extend the sequence further upstream, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was attempted, but it added only four additional base pairs. Sequences at the 5′-end of pBSp47–17 were used to search again the EST data base. A recently deposited HeLa EST (AA179721) that overlaps pBSp47–17 with a perfect match extends the 5′-sequence by 30 bp and contains an in frame ATG codon followed by four new codons. Another human EST, AA158173, from pancreas DNA, extends the pBSp47–17 sequence by only four codons just up to the ATG and matches perfectly the sequence in AA179721. The validity of the AA179721 sequence was strengthened by the finding that two independent mouse ESTs for p47 encode an N-terminal amino acid sequence nearly identical to the human sequence (murine MASPA; human MATPA) and a similar 5′-UTR sequence: GCAAAG ATG GCT TCT CCG GCC (corresponding to nucleotides 1–21 in accession number U94855; bases shown in boldface type differ from the human sequence). The DNA sequence in pBSp47–17 plus the 21-bp 5′-extension that overlaps the mouse sequence, was deposited in GenBankTM as accession number U94855. A cDNA encoding full-length p47 was constructed as described below. Of five peptide sequences derived from rabbit p40 (Table I), two match well (9/10 and 10/10) a 102-bp human EST (Z20189). Primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-regions of the EST were synthesized and used to amplify by PCR the DNA from a λZAP human liver cDNA library (Stratagene). The resulting 115-bp DNA was subcloned into the EcoRI/HindIII sites of pSP73 (Promega) to generate pSPp40–115, which was sequenced to confirm its identity to the 102-bp human EST. The radiolabeled 115-bp fragment was used to screen 6 × 105 phages in the λZAP human liver cDNA library used above, and one positive phage was purified. After excision in vivo, pBSp40–5 was obtained that carries a 1245-bp cDNA that lacks a suitable ATG initiation codon (see 舠Results舡 below). The cDNA sequence in pBSp40–5 was determined on both strands with deletion derivatives made with restriction enzymesSphI and SpeI, which cleave the cDNA at 0.4 and 0.8 kb from the 5′-end, respectively, and it was used to search the EST data base. Eight human ESTs were found to overlap pBSp40–5 and extend its 5′-sequence: W72146, T33675, T31050, T34146, T36262, T35271,T34243, and N56412. All overlap one another and are identical in the overlapping regions, except for an insertion of C following T-7 and a deletion of C-17 in W72146 and the deletion of G-20 in N56412, all of which were judged to be errors in the EST sequences. The EST T34243extends the sequence in pBSp40–5 by 36 bp, GAAAG ATG GCG TCC CGC AAG GAA GGT ACC GGC TCT A, and contains an in frame ATG (underlined). The T34243 sequence overlaps and matches that of the longer W72146 sequence (except as noted above), confirming that it is a true extension of pBSp40–5. Further confirmation comes from six mouse ESTs (W92967, W54757, W48250, W98176, W49960, and W33557) that contain the homologous sequence, GAAAC ATG GCG TCG CGC AAG GAA GGC ACC GG(C/T) TC(T/C) A (bases not identical between the human and mouse sequences are shown in boldface type). The N-terminal amino acids derived from the mouse ESTs are identical to those encoded by the human sequence. To construct a cDNA encoding full-length p40, PCR amplification of pBSp40–5 was performed with the upstream primer 5′-CCCGAATTCCAT ATG GCG TCC CGC AAG GAA GGT ACC GGC TCT ACT GCC ACC TCT TCC AG-3′ (tagged withEcoRI and NdeI sites and with the coding sequence in pBSp40–5 underlined) and a primer that contains the T7 promoter sequence and anneals downstream of the pBSp40–5 insert. The amplified DNA was cleaved with EcoRI and SphI, and the resulting 0.4-kb fragment was used to replace the correspondingEcoRI-SphI fragment in pBSp40–5 to yield pBSp40N. Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing HeLa cells (15Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 108-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA and Northern blotting was conducted as described previously (8Méthot M. Rom E. Olsen H. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1110-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with radioactive probes derived from pBS67165 (eIF3-p66; 0.35-kbEcoRI-NcoI fragment), pBS61212 (eIF3-p47; 0.35-kbEcoRI-BclI fragment), and pSPp40–115 (eIF3-p40; the 115-bp PCR DNA). Hybridizing RNAs were visualized by autoradiography. For expression of eIF3-p66 cDNA in bacteria, pBSp66N was constructed as follows. A 0.95-kb EcoRI-NcoI fragment was amplified by PCR from pBSp66 with primer KAP66N (5′-CCCGAATTCCAT ATG GCA AAG TTC ATG ACA CC-3′; tagged withEcoRI and NdeI sites and with the initiator ATG of the p66 ORF underlined) and a T7 primer that anneals to the vector downstream from the 3′-end of the insert. The resulting amplified DNA was sequenced and then used to replace the 0.35-kbEcoRI-NcoI fragment of pBS67165 to generate pBSp66N. To construct pT7p66, the 1.8-kbNdeI-XhoI fragment of pBSp66N was cloned into theNdeI and SalI sites of pT7–7 (20Wei C.-L. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5764-5771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For p47 synthesis, pT7p47–17 first was constructed by subcloning the entire 1.2-kb EcoRI-XhoI cDNA insert of pBSp47–17 into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pT7–7. The plasmid encodes an altered form of p47 whose N-terminal five amino acids are replaced with MARTRHD encoded by the vector and by the linker sequence employed for generation of the liver cDNA library. The N-terminal sequence was corrected by PCR amplification of pBSp47–17 DNA with the primer 5′-CCCGAA TTCCAT ATG GCC ACA CCG GCG GTA CCA GTA AGT GCT CCT C-3′ (tagged with EcoRI andNdeI sites and with the region corresponding to the pBSp47–17 sequence underlined) and 5′-GCT GTC CAC AAT GGA GGC C-3′ that anneals to the p47 cDNA at residues 321–303 downstream from aNotI site at residue 269 (numbered as deposited as accession number U94855). The resulting 0.3-kb fragment was digested withNdeI and NotI and used to replace the 0.25-kbNdeI-NotI fragment of pT7p47–17 to generate pT7p47. For p40 synthesis, pT7p40 was constructed by cleaving pBSp40N with NdeI and XhoI and subcloning the 1.3-kb fragment into the NdeI-SalI sites of pT7–7. pT7p66, pT7p47, and pT7p40 were linearized by digestion withClaI, HindIII, and HindIII, respectively, and used as templates for in vitrotranscription/translation (TnT system, Promega) with [35S]methionine. The radioactive translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) alongside a lane containing purified human eIF3. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and subjected to autoradiography. To construct pGEXp66 encoding a GST-p66 (full-length) fusion protein, the 1.8-kb EcoRI-XhoI fragment of pBSp66N was subcloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). To make N-terminal deletions of the eIF3-p66 portion of the fusion protein, we synthesized the following two upstream primers: 5′-GGGAATTCTG GCG CGC ACA CAG AAG ACG-3′ (tagged with an EcoRI site and with the sequence corresponding to nucleotides 326–343 of the eIF3-p66 cDNA sequence underlined) and 5′-GGGAATT CTG CAA TTT GGG GTT AGG CAG-3′ (tagged with an EcoRI site and with the sequence corresponding to nucleotides 497–514 underlined). DNA fragments encoding different parts of eIF3-p66 were amplified with one of these two primers and with a downstream primer (5′-TCT CAA GCA CTG CTG GG-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 1057–1041 of eIF3-p66 cDNA. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI andNcoI, and the resulting 0.7- and 0.5-kb DNA fragments were used to replace the 1.0-kb EcoRI-NcoI fragment of pBSp66 to produce pBSp66-D1 and pBSp66-D2, respectively. The truncated reading frames encoded in the 1.5- and 1.3-kbEcoRI-XhoI fragments of these plasmids were subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Pharmacia) to generate pGEXp66-D1 and pGEXp66-D2, respectively. To construct C-terminal deletions, we employed PvuII, PstI, EarI, andBsp120I, which cleaves the p66 cDNA in pBSp66N at positions 311, 425, 553, and 660, respectively. The 0.3-kbEcoRI-PvuII fragment, the 0.35-kbEcoRI-PstI fragment (with the 5′-overhang produced by PstI removed by mung bean nuclease), and the 0.4-kb EcoRI-EarI fragment (with the 3′-overhang produced by EarI filled in with Klenow enzyme) were subcloned into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of pGEX-4T-1 to generate pGEXp66ΔP2, pGEXp66ΔP1, and pGEXp66ΔE, respectively. To construct pGEXp66ΔB, the 0.6-kbEcoRI-Bsp120I fragment of pBSp66N was subcloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of pGEX-4T-1. pT7p66 was transformed into strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) containing the isopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 RNA polymerase gene, and expression of p66 was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside, as recommended by the manufacturer. To analyze the binding of RNA to recombinant eIF3-p66 by Northwestern analysis, transformed BL21(DE3) lysate proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BA085, Schleicher and Schuell). 32P-Labeled ॆ-globin mRNA was incubated with the membrane (Northwestern blotting) as described previously (20Wei C.-L. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5764-5771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A full-length GST-p66 fusion protein and its deletion derivatives were expressed in strain BL21(DE3) and purified by affinity chromatography as recommended by the manufacturer (Pharmacia). In the case of GST-p66-D2, the purified fraction contained a single polypeptide of the expected size (73.7 kDa) and was isolated with a yield of 0.5 mg/liter of E. coli culture. The other purified proteins were of the expected size but were obtained in lesser yields, along with numerous smaller polypeptides, presumably a result of degradation. We scanned Coomassie-stained gels and used NIH Image software to quantitate the amounts of the expected products, which varied between 0.25 and 0.005 mg/liter of E. coli culture. To conduct Northwestern analysis of these GST-p66 proteins, the same molar amount of each full-length deletion form was subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted with32P-labeled ॆ-globin mRNA as described above. To conduct phylogenetic analyses of the Mov-34 family in the data base, the following three cDNA sequences were assembled from EST sequences obtained entirely from the data base. Although the resulting sequences are hypothetical, we checked the validity of each one by two criteria: (i) multiple independent occurrence of overlapping EST sequences and (ii) high similarity between the deduced human and mouse polypeptide sequences. During a BLAST search of sequences related to the human p47 sequence in the EST data base, we found four related ESTs showing a good match at the N-terminal conserved region (regions II–IV in Fig. 5 B). They areT32502 (human), T17206 (human), W71047 (mouse), and W98454 (mouse). More ESTs were sought that overlap these ESTs. The correct ORF was deduced by comparing the human sequences with the mouse ones. Thus, four human ESTs, T17206 (1–350; N13 was deleted, N119 is A according to W98545), W22816 (71–321; C inserted after C277 based on W44355), T88904 (439–320; C408 deleted based on W32482), and W45708 (340–1; N328 is T based on H92903), which contain fewer apparent errors, were edited to make a continuous 1042-bp cDNA sequence (deposited in GenBankTM as accession number U70735). This encodes a 297-amino acid protein of 33,553 Da. The ORF (nucleotides 44–937) was confirmed by a number of overlapping murine ESTs that encode a nearly identical peptide sequence. The proposed initiator ATG is surrounded by GTGATGG, a good consensus sequence (21Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Nucleotides 1–25 do not match either murine or rat sequences despite overlapping with other human ESTs, supporting the initiation codon assignment at nucleotides 44–46. The 3′-UTR contains a polyadenylation signal, AATAAA. During a BLAST search for C. elegans F37A4_5 homologs in the EST data base, we found nine ESTs with a good match. They are N50270, W92668,AA004500, T33527, N31767, and T33374 from humans, and AA009202, W13206, and W87953 from mice. More ESTs were sought that overlap these ESTs. The human and mouse sequences encode nearly identical proteins, despite a number of conservative base changes in the DNA sequences. In addition, less well conserved regions flanking the presumed coding regions suggest that they are untranslated regions. Thus, we generated a hypothetical murine cDNA sequence from W87953 (1–448; G421 was deleted based on human AA004500), AA009202(1–393), and W13206 (1–339; T inserted after T21 based on human N90861), which together make a continuous 1190-bp cDNA sequence (deposited in GenBankTM as accession numberU70736). This encodes a 334-amino acid protein of 37,547 Da. The protein is named the mouse 38-kDa Mov-34 homolog. To edit human ESTs encoding the 38-kDa homolog, six ESTs with fewer apparent errors were used to generate the cDNA sequence: T36298(1–359), N31767 (347–407), AA004550 (46–111), W92668 (15–263; N62 is T, N168 is A, and G inserted after G184, all based on human N50270), N50615 (95–333), andN90861 (302–1). The cDNA sequence is 1277 bp long and encodes a 334-amino acid protein of 37,427 Da (deposited in GenBankTMas accession number U70734). The human 38-kDa homolog is 98.57 identical to the mouse homolog, although the coding region is only 91.57 identical at the DNA sequence level. This confirms the authenticity of the coding regions both for the mouse and human homologs. The 3′-UTR of the human sequence contains a polyadenylation signal, AATAAA. cDNA clones 115I17 (accession number T43107) and 139G4 (accession number T46657) that encode A. thalianaMov-34 homologs were kindly provided by the ArabidopsisBiological Resource Center (Columbus, OH). The cDNA inserts (1.3 kb for 115I17 and 1.2 kb for 139G4) were cloned into SalI (5′) and NotI (3′) sites of pZL1 (Life Technologies, Inc). We made deletions with restriction enzymes and sequenced the resulting constructs as follows. The enzymes used were as follows: for 139G4,SalI (cuts at 0.15 kb from the 5′-end) andHindIII (at 0.5 kb); for 139G4, EcoRI (at 0.35 kb) and HindIII (at 0.5 and 1.0 kb). Two custom-made primers were made for each clone, and the entire sequence was determined for both strands. The cDNA sequences of clones 115I17 and 139G4 were deposited in GenBankTM as accession numbers U54560 andU54561, respectively. They encode a 3"
https://openalex.org/W2048202003,"We analyzed the interaction of convulxin (Cvx), a 72-kDa protein isolated from the venom of Crotalus durissus terrificus, with human platelets. Cvx is a potent platelet agonist that induces an increase in the intracellular Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+] i), granule exocytosis and aggregation. 125I-Labeled Cvx binds specifically and rapidly to platelets at binding sites of high and moderate affinity. Platelets adhere to immobilized Cvx in a time-dependent but cation-independent manner. Platelet exocytosis and aggregation induced by Cvx were inhibited by an anti-integrin α2ॆ1 monoclonal antibody (6F1) and by the Fab fragments of a polyclonal anti-glycoprotein VI (GPVI) antibody. Both the adhesion of platelets to Cvx and the Cvx-induced increase in [Ca2+] i were inhibited by anti-GPVI Fab fragments but not by 6F1. Ligand blotting assay showed that 125I-Cvx binds to a 57-kDa platelet protein with an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of GPVI. In addition, we observed the following: (i)125I-Cvx binds to GPVI immunoprecipitated by the anti-GPVI antibody from a platelet lysate, and (ii) Cvx inhibits the binding of anti-GPVI IgG to GPVI. Taken together, these results demonstrate that GPVI behaves as a Cvx receptor and that the α2ॆ1 integrin appears to be involved in the later stages of Cvx-induced platelet activation,i.e. exocytosis and aggregation.

Many snake venom proteins are known to interact with platelets. Some behave in vitro as cell agonists, and others are inhibitors of platelet activation induced by physiological agents (1Brinkhous K.M. Smith S.V. Pirkle H. Markland Jr., F.S. Hematology, Hemostasis and Animal Venoms. 7. Marcel Dekker, New York1988: 363-376Google Scholar). Several groups can be distinguished according to their mechanism of action and molecular structure: inhibitory and activating proteases, glycoproteins (aggregoserpentins) and lectins (thrombolectins) that stimulate platelets, or peptides that inhibit platelet aggregation (disintegrins) (2Zingali R.B.

Platelet aggregation induced by Cvx has been shown to be Ca2+-dependent but fibrinogen-, ADP-, and cyclooxygenase-independent (6Vargaftig B.B Joseph D. Wal F. Marlas G. Chignard M. Chevance L.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 92: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The transduction pathway activated by Cvx involves the activation of a phospholipase Cγ and activation of tyrosine kinases (7Faili A. Randon J. Francischetti I.M.B. Vargaftig B.B Hatmi M. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 2I. M. B. Francischetti, F. A. Ghazaleh, R. A. M. Reis, C. R. Carlini, and J. A. Guimarães, submitted for publication. Cvx also binds to rabbit platelets with a high affinity (8Francischetti I.M.B. Saliou B. Leduc M. Carlini C.R. Hatmi M. Randon J. Faili A. Bon C. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Most studies performed on Cvx have been conducted on animal, and particularly rabbit, platelets, but platelet membrane components are better known in humans. We have therefore focused our studies on Cvx interaction with human platelets to elucidate its mechanism of action. We show that Cvx is a particularly potent activator of human platelets, inducing an increase in [Ca2+] i, granule exocytosis, and aggregation, and that immobilized Cvx induces a cation-independent platelet adhesion. Cvx binds specifically and rapidly to washed and to fixed platelets with a high affinity. Use of specific antibodies showed that GPIb, GPIV, and GPV do not interact with Cvx but that both the platelet integrin α2ॆ1 (GPIa-IIa) and GPVI are involved in platelet activation induced by Cvx, and that GPVI acts as a platelet receptor for Cvx. Cvx was purified from the venom of C. d. terrificus (Pentapharm, Basel, Switzerland and Syntex Laboratories, Ribero Preto, Brazil) as described previously (8Francischetti I.M.B. Saliou B. Leduc M. Carlini C.R. Hatmi M. Randon J. Faili A. Bon C. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cvx was labeled with 125I using the IODOGEN procedure (Pierce) and Na125I (Amersham, Les Ulis, France). Specific activity of the labeled compound was 9 MBq/mg, and labeling did not modify the biological properties of Cvx. The monoclonal anti-GPIbα antibody, SZ2, and the anti-GPV antibody, SW16, were purchased from Immunotech (Marseille, France). The anti-α2ॆ1 integrin monoclonal antibodies used were 6F1 (9Coller B.S. Beer J.H. Scudder L.E. Steinberg M.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 182-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a generous gift from Dr. Barry S. Coller (Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY), and Gi9, purchased from Immunotech. The anti-GPIV antibody FA6-152 produced by Dr. Lena Edelman (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) was kindly provided by Dr. C. Legrand (INSERM U-353, Paris, France). Purification of human polyclonal anti-GPVI IgG, from the serum of a patient with autoimmune thrombocytopenia (10Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was performed by chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Fab fragments were prepared from purified IgG incubated for 90 min at 37 °C, with papain (Sigma; 1 ॖg/100 ॖg of IgG), in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl (PBS), pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1.77 (v/v) ॆ-mercaptoethanol. Iodoacetamide (30 mm) was then added and left for 15 min at 37 °C, and the sample was dialyzed in PBS. Fc fragments were removed on protein A-Sepharose. The purity of Fab fragments and the absence of contaminating IgG, in particular, were controlled by SDS-PAGE. Purified anti-GPVI IgG induced platelet aggregation, whereas Fab fragments inhibited both collagen- and anti-GPVI IgG-induced platelet aggregation as reported previously (10Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control human IgG and Fab fragments used in these studies were prepared from the plasma of healthy donors according to the procedures described above. Anti-Cvx antibody was kindly provided by Dr. M. Leduc (Unité des Venins Institut Pasteur). Calf skin collagen type I, obtained from Stago (Asnières, France), was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blood from healthy human volunteers was collected by venipuncture on acid-citrate-dextrose anticoagulant (ACD-A) or on trisodium citrate. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained by centrifugation at 110 × g for 15 min. Platelet secretion and adhesion were determined using platelets labeled in PRP (ACD-A) incubated with 0.6 ॖm[14C]5-hydroxytryptamine (Amersham, Les Ulis, France) and 2 ॖCi/ml 51Cr (CIS International, Gif-sur-Yvette, France), for 30 min at 37 °C respectively. Platelets were sedimented at 1100 × g for 15 min after acidification of the PRP to pH 6.5 with ACD-A and addition of 25 ॖg/ml apyrase (Sigma) and 100 nm prostaglandin E1 (Sigma) and resuspended in washing buffer (103 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 36 mm citric acid) at pH 6.5 containing 3.5 mg/ml BSA (Sigma), 25 ॖg/ml apyrase, and 100 nm prostaglandin E1 (11Jandrot-Perrus M. Guillin M.C. Nurden A.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 58: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After sedimentation, the platelets were washed twice in this buffer and resuspended at 3 × 108/ml in the reaction buffer composed of 5 mmHepes, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mmglucose, pH 7.4, containing 3.5 mg/ml BSA. Formaldehyde-fixed platelets were prepared by incubating 1 volume of citrated PRP with 0.98 volume of 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and 0.02 volume of 307 (w/v) formaldehyde for 18 h at room temperature and in the dark. Fixed platelets were washed three times in PBS before resuspension in PBS. PRP or washed platelets were preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C in the presence of buffer or antibodies before aggregation was initiated by Cvx or collagen. Experiments were performed under stirring conditions at 37 °C in a Chrono-Log aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp, Haverton, PA). Release of [14C]5-HT was measured as described previously (11Jandrot-Perrus M. Guillin M.C. Nurden A.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 58: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Platelet adhesion was measured on microtitration plates. Typical experiments were performed as follows. Collagen (2 ॖg) in 100 ॖl of 20 mm acetic acid, Cvx (1.4 ॖg) in 100 ॖl of PBS, or BSA (5 ॖg) in 100 ॖl of PBS were immobilized on Immulon II plates (Dynatech, St-Cloud, France) for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were then saturated with 2 mg/ml BSA in PBS for 1 h, and washed with PBS and with reaction buffer.51Cr-Labeled platelets (2 × 108/ml in reaction buffer, 100 ॖl) were added to the wells in the presence or absence of 300 ॖm Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) peptide (Bachem Biochimie, Voisins-le-Bretonneux, France) or 2 mm EDTA. A certain number of experiments were performed in the presence of antibodies, as indicated in the text. Wells were emptied and washed three times with reaction buffer after different incubation times at room temperature, One hundred ॖl of 27 SDS (w/v) was subsequently added to each well, and the samples were counted for51Cr. Intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+] i) transients were monitored by fura-2 fluorescence. Platelets were resuspended in washing buffer after centrifugation of the PRP and loaded with 2 ॖm fura 2-acetoxymethylester (fura 2-AM, Sigma) for 60 min at 37 °C, centrifuged again, washed twice, and resuspended in reaction buffer. The platelets (2 × 108/ml) were then preincubated with 2 mm CaCl2 in the absence or presence of different antibodies for 3 min at 37 °C prior to addition of Cvx or collagen. Fluorescence was measured at 37 °C using two excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm on an Hitachi H-2000 spectrofluorimeter (Sciencetec, Les Ulis, France). Maximal and minimal fluorescence were determined after platelet lysis with 17 (v/v) Triton X-100 and the addition of 2 mm EGTA, respectively. Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using aK d of 224 nm for the interaction between fura 2 and Ca2+ (12Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Washed or formaldehyde-fixed platelets (3 × 108/ml) were incubated at 37 °C in 400 ॖl with various amounts of125I-labeled Cvx. The platelets were transferred to tubes containing 500 ॖl of 207 (w/v) sucrose in PBS after different incubation times, and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 ×g. Supernatants were aspirated, and the tips of the tubes were counted for 125I to determine the fraction of Cvx bound to platelets. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 100–500-fold excess of unlabeled Cvx. Platelet lysates were prepared by solubilization of washed platelets (109/ml) with 27 (w/v) SDS in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma), for 5 min at 100 °C. Proteins (7 ॖg) were separated on 107 acrylamide slab gels (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Ivry-sur-Seine, France). The membranes were then soaked with 57 (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBS, incubated with 125I-labeled Cvx (50 ng/ml) in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.57 (w/v) dry milk and 0.27 (v/v) Tween 20, washed, and exposed to X-AR films (Kodak). Nitrocellulose sheets were incubated alternatively with 9 ॖg/ml anti-GPVI IgG in PBS, pH 8.6, containing 0.17 dry milk and 0.017 Tween 20, followed by125I-labeled protein A or peroxidase-coupled protein A revealed by chemiluminescence (Amersham). Platelet lysates were obtained by solubilization of washed platelets (5 × 109/ml) with 17 (v/v) Nonidet P-40 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl containing 15 ॖg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 50 kallikrein-inactivating units of aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 2 mm benzamidine HCl, and 2 mm EDTA (lysis buffer), at 4 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifugation to avoid nonspecific precipitation. Cleared lysates were incubated with 200 ॖg/ml anti-GPVI IgG for 30 min at room temperature and then protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. Samples were centrifuged at 2,000 × g, and the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by 27 SDS in Laemmli buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were probed using 125I-Cvx or anti-GPVI IgGs, as described above. Washed human platelets aggregated in response to Cvx (Fig.1) as reported previously for rabbit platelets (6Vargaftig B.B Joseph D. Wal F. Marlas G. Chignard M. Chevance L.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 92: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Aggregation was also observed in PRP and was preceded by a change in cell shape. The effect of Cvx was tested on formaldehyde-fixed platelets to verify that Cvx induced true platelet aggregation rather than passive agglutination. No modification of light transmittance was observed for suspensions of fixed platelets, indicating that Cvx does not agglutinate platelets (data not shown). The threshold concentration of Cvx that typically induced platelet aggregation was between 15 and 35 pm. Important heterogeneity in platelet sensitivity to Cvx was observed with platelets from normal individuals however. Secretion of [14C]5-HT from dense granules paralleled aggregation. The dose-response curve was sigmoid and characterized by a very abrupt slope (Fig. 2 A). Aggregation was prevented by 2 mm EDTA and by 300 ॖm RGDS peptide, which block fibrinogen binding to integrin αIIbॆ3. In contrast, neither cell shape change nor [14C]5-HT release were inhibited by EDTA or RGDS peptide (Fig. 2 B). Along with granule exocytosis and cell aggregation, Cvx induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+] i. Following a lag phase, which could be shortened by increasing the Cvx concentration, [Ca2+] i reached a plateau that remained stable for 3 min (Fig. 3).Figure 2Convulxin-induced platelet secretion.[14C]5-HT-labeled washed platelets (3 × 108/ml) were incubated with various concentrations of Cvx in the aggregometer cuvette. After 2 min of incubation, samples were transferred to EDTA and centrifuged and the secretion of [14C]5-HT was measured as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 The release is expressed as the percentage of the total platelet content in [14C]5-HT. In A, experiments were performed in the presence of 2 mmCaCl2 and results are the mean ± S.D. of five experiments. In B, platelets were suspended in reaction buffer containing: 2 mm CaCl2 (open bar), 2 mm EDTA (dotted bar), or 300 ॖm RGDS (hatched bar). Cvx concentration was 200 pm. Results are from one representative experiment out of three.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Convulxin-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+. Platelets (2 × 108/ml) that had been loaded with Fura 2-AM were incubated at 37 °C with various concentrations of Cvx: a, 91 pm; b, 61 pm; c, 46 pm.

Platelets also bound to immobilized collagen under similar static conditions. Platelet adhesion was a function of the coating concentration in both cases and reached a maximum for Cvx and collagen concentrations ≥ 10 ॖg/ml (data not shown). A total of 43 ± 27 of the platelets were bound to immobilized Cvx after 1 h of incubation when the proportion of platelets bound to immobilized collagen was 2-fold lower and less than 0.57 were bound to immobilized BSA. The number of platelets bound to Cvx and collagen decreased to 12.7 ± 0.57 and 8.6 ± 0.87, respectively, due to inhibition of platelet aggregation when experiments were performed in the presence of 300 ॖm RGDS (Fig. 4). These results indicate that platelet aggregation is more important in Cvx-coated wells than collagen-coated wells and confirms that Cvx has a high potency for inducing platelet activation. The proportion of platelets bound to Cvx remained unchanged in the presence of EDTA (2 mm) as in the presence of RGDS, but platelet adhesion to collagen was prevented by EDTA (Fig. 4), as reported previously (14Santoro S.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). 125I-Cvx bound to washed platelets in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig.5). Nonspecific binding measured in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled Cvx represented less than 107 of the total radioactivity added. Association of125I-Cvx with human platelets at 37 °C was rapid and reached a steady state at 15 min (Fig. 5 A). Addition of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled Cvx 15 min after the addition of125I-Cvx to platelets showed, in contrast, that dissociation was very slow, with less than 17 of the bound125I-Cvx being displaced per minute in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled Cvx (data not shown). Scatchard plot analysis of specific binding of 125I-Cvx to human platelets indicated two classes of binding sites, one of high affinity and low capacity and one of moderate affinity and capacity (TableI). Comparable results were obtained when formaldehyde-fixed platelets were used. Affinities were slightly lower in this case, but receptor number was increased for both classes of sites (Table I). Additional experiments were performed in the presence of sugars such as 45 mm galactose or mannose or in the presence of 10 ॖg/ml WGA, suspected previously to interact with the Cvx binding site on platelets (15Sano-Martins S.J. Daimon T. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), to rule out the possibility that Cvx binding to platelets might be due to a lectin-like activity. None of the above compounds modified Cvx binding to platelets (data not shown).Table IBinding of 125I-labeled Cvx to human plateletsSitesWashed plateletsFixed plateletsK dB maxK dB maxnmmol/plateletnmmol/plateletHigh affinity sites0.08 ± 0.02130 ± 300.22 ± 0.09300 ± 160Moderate affinity sites1.20 ± 0.141700 ± 4004.42 ± 1.02900 ± 450Washed or formaldehyde-fixed platelets (3 × 108/ml) were incubated at 37 °C with various concentrations of 125I-Cvx.

K d is expressed in nm and B max in molecules/platelet. Specific antibodies to known membrane glycoproteins were tested for their effect on Cvx-induced platelet activation to discover whether these glycoproteins were involved in Cvx interaction with platelets. We tested antibodies to glycoproteins already identified as receptors for different cell agonists or ligands, such as the GPIb-V-IX complex (receptor for von Willebrand factor), the integrin α2ॆ1 and GPVI (receptors for collagen), and GPIV (CD 36), which has a less clearly defined function and may act as a collagen and/or thrombospondin receptor (16Clemetson K.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies with inhibitory activity against GPIbα (SZ2), GPIV (FA6-152), and GPV (SW16) had no effect on Cvx-induced platelet aggregation, platelet adhesion to Cvx, or Cvx binding to platelets (data not shown). Cvx-induced platelet aggregation and secretion were both inhibited, in contrast by 6F1, a monoclonal antibody against integrin α2ॆ1and by polyclonal anti-GPVI Fab fragments (Fig.6, A and B). Inhibition by 6F1 was concentration-dependent and reached a maximum after preincubation of the platelets with 1 ॖg/ml antibody for 3 min at 37 °C. Inhibition was total for low concentrations of Cvx (<50 pm) but could be overcome by increasing the concentration of Cvx above 0.1 nm. Another monoclonal anti-α2ॆ1 antibody, Gi9, also inhibited Cvx-induced platelet aggregation but was less potent than 6F1, inhibition being 307 and 807 with 1 ॖg/ml and 5 ॖg/ml of Gi9, respectively. The anti-GPVI Fab fragments, at 0.2 mg/ml, produced a ∼507 inhibition of platelet aggregation and secretion induced by 30–40 pm Cvx. As with 6F1, inhibition of platelet aggregation and secretion by the anti-GPVI Fab fragments was overcome by increasing the concentration of Cvx. Control experiments showed that nonimmune human Fab had no effect on Cvx-induced platelet aggregation and secretion (data not shown). The concentrations of 6F1, Gi9, and anti-GPVI Fab fragments that inhibited Cvx-induced platelet aggregation also inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation (data not shown and Refs. 9Coller B.S. Beer J.H. Scudder L.E. Steinberg M.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 182-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 10Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in [Ca2+] i concentration induced by Cvx was prevented by preincubation of platelets with the anti-GPVI Fab fragments (Fig. 6 C). 6F1 (1 ॖg/ml) did not decrease the signal induced by Cvx in contrast but completely inhibited Ca2+ mobilization induced by collagen (Fig. 6 C). The effects of 6F1 and anti-GPVI Fab-fragments on platelet adhesion to immobilized Cvx and collagen were also analyzed. All experiments were performed in the presence of 300 ॖm RGDS to avoid platelet aggregation. None of the antibodies modified the number of51Cr-labeled platelets bound to immobilized Cvx after a 60-min incubation, whereas 6F1 inhibited platelet adhesion to collagen by 907 (data not shown), as shown by others (9Coller B.S. Beer J.H. Scudder L.E. Steinberg M.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 182-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used shorter incubation times (5 min for Cvx and 15 min for collagen) to increase the chances of observing an inhibition since binding of Cvx to platelets is rapid, whereas dissociation is very slow. Approximately the same percentage of platelets adhered to the two proteins under these conditions. Platelet adhesion to Cvx at 5 min was not significantly reduced by the presence of 6F1 (even at concentrations up to 10 ॖg/ml), but platelet adhesion to collagen at 15 min was clearly inhibited by 6F1 at a concentration as low as 0.5 ॖg/ml (Fig.7). Gi9 also failed to inhibit platelet adhesion to Cvx, but it inhibited platelet adhesion to collagen (data not shown). The anti-GPVI Fab fragments (0.2 mg/ml) inhibited platelet adhesion to Cvx significantly in contrast, and also inhibited platelet adhesion to collagen at 15 min (Fig. 7). The possibility that Cvx recognizes a specific platelet protein was tested using a ligand blotting assay, since Cvx has a very high affinity for platelets. Binding of125I-Cvx was observed to occur on a single band ofM r = 57,000 ± 1000 (Fig.8 A) after separation of proteins from whole platelet lysates by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Labeling of this band was not observed when the incubation was performed in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled Cvx, or 50 ॖg/ml anti-Cvx antibody, indicating that binding was specific. No binding of labeled Cvx was observed when the platelet proteins were reduced with 57 ॆ-mercaptoethanol before electrophoresis. Binding was not inhibited in the presence of 5 ॖg/ml WGA, and was still observed after pretreatment of platelets with 5 nm thrombin, or 3 ॖg/ml protease of Serratia marcescens or 1 ॖmα-chymotrypsin, respectively (data not shown). The latter findings indicated that this 57-kDa protein was neither a binding site for WGA nor degraded to any great extent by these proteases. We also observed a protein band migrating at the same position in membrane extracts obtained after cellular fractionation (data not shown). It appeared likely that this 57-kDa platelet protein corresponded to GPVI since the size of the protein recognized by 125I-Cvx was similar to that reported for GPVI (10Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sano-Martins S.J. Daimon T.

Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and platelet activation by Cvx was inhibited by the anti-GPVI Fab fragments. Immunoprecipitates of platelet lysates obtained with the anti-GPVI IgG were probed with125I-Cvx to test this possibility. Fig. 8 B shows that the immunoprecipitated platelet protein interacted with125I-Cvx. Competition experiments using nitrocellulose membranes incubated with the anti-GPVI IgG in the presence of cold Cvx were therefore performed. The intensity of the band labeled by the anti-GPVI IgG decreased as the concentration of Cvx increased, thus confirming that Cvx and the anti-GPVI IgG bind to the same protein,i.e. GPVI (Fig. 8 C). The present study demonstrates that Cvx is a very potent activator of human platelets and that the membrane glycoproteins GPVI and integrin α2ॆ1 are both involved in the activation pathway. Cvx at picomolar concentrations induces extensive activation of stirred platelets, resulting in exocytosis of dense granules and aggregation. Although some authors (6Vargaftig B.B Joseph D. Wal F. Marlas G. Chignard M. Chevance L.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 92: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have reported that Cvx-induced activation of rabbit platelets is calcium-dependent, our results show that Cvx-induced platelet activation of human platelets occurs in the absence of external Ca2+ and is in agreement with the findings of Sano-Martins and Daimon (15Sano-Martins S.J. Daimon T. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, Cvx induces an increase in [Ca2+] i. The kinetic of Cvx-induced Ca2+ mobilization is slow when compared with the very rapid response induced by other agonists such as thrombin (19Kroll M.H. Schafer A.I.

Monogr. 1996; 161: 83-103Google Scholar). These receptors are activated both by endogenously expressed opioid peptides and by structurally distinct alkaloid agonists, which are clinically important analgesics and drugs of abuse (4Hughes J. Kosterlitz H.W. Br. Med. Bull. 1977; 33: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although many alkaloid analgesics activate more than one type of opioid receptor at clinically relevant concentrations, significant differences in the regulation of δ, ॖ, and κ receptor-mediated processes by individual agonists have been observed (5Yasuda K.

Monogr. 1996; 161: 127-140Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms underlying this functional specificity, even in the presence of relatively nonselective opiate drugs, are not understood. We have identified a mechanism of receptor regulation that mediates type-specific regulation of opioid receptors following activation by the same alkaloid agonist. Previous studies have identified multiple processes that regulate opioid receptors. Ligand-dependent phosphorylation of cytoplasmic residues is thought to modulate the functional activity of opioid receptors within minutes after activation (8Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J.

Agonist-induced down-regulation, which is associated with a gradual translocation of receptors from the plasma membrane to lysosomes, occurs over a more prolonged time course (10Law P.-Y. Hom D.S.

A distinguishable rapid endocytic process, which occurs within several minutes after receptor activation and is not associated with degradation of receptors, has been shown recently to regulate δ and ॖ opioid receptors (13Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 14Sternini C.

Individual analgesic drugs differ significantly in their ability to stimulate this process of rapid internalization (13Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L.

Freeman J.C. Reisine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 782-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Here we show that, in addition to the agonist selectivity of this endocytic mechanism, structurally homologous opioid receptors are differentially internalized in a type-specific manner following activation by the same alkaloid agonist. We have established this by focusing on the effects of etorphine, a potent and relatively nonselective opiate agonist (17Raynor K. Kong H. Chen Y. Yasuda K. Yu L. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 330-334PubMed Google Scholar), on the membrane trafficking of epitope-tagged mutant δ and κ opioid receptors expressed in transfected cells. These observations identify a fundamental mechanism of receptor regulation that mediates type-specific effects of relatively nonselective opiate drugs that activate multiple types of opioid receptor in vivo. Construction of FLAG-tagged δ opioid receptors was reported previously (13Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

For experiments involving co-expression of δ and κ receptors in the same cells, the murine δ opioid receptor was tagged in the amino-terminal extracellular domain with the HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; Cr., chimera; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. epitope (YPYDVPDYA), exactly as described previously in studies of adrenergic receptors (18von Zastrow M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 763-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeric mutant δ/κ opioid receptors were constructed as follows. Exchanges in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain were accomplished by engineering an EcoRV site immediately distal to a conserved cysteine residue in the δ and κ receptors (residues 328 and 340, respectively) using synthetic oligonucleotides and polymerase chain reaction (Vent polymerase, New England Biolabs) under standard conditions. The κ and δ sequences distal to this cysteine residue were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and fused into this site to exchange the divergent portions of this domain, creating Crs. 1 and 2. Cr. 3 was constructed by exchange between Crs. 1 and 2 using a conserved BglII site located in the third extracellular domain of the δ and κ receptors. Crs. 4 and 5 were constructed from the wild-type δ and κ receptors using thisBglII site, and Cr. 6 was constructed from the δ receptor and Cr. 2 using the same approach. Mutant sequences produced at each step were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and completed cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cells. cDNAs encoding HA-tagged wild-type and K44E mutant dynamin I (20Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. Richard Vallee (Worcester Institute, Shrewsbury, MA) and were cloned into pcDNA3 for expression. Human 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained and passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum (University of California at San Francisco Cell Culture Facility). Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. Clones of stably transfected cells were selected using 0.5 mg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Relative levels of receptor expression were compared between cell clones by fluorescence flow cytometry, as described previously (13Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Experiments using transiently transfected cells were conducted 48–72 h after transfection. Experiments with stably transfected cells were conducted on individual clones uniformly expressing epitope-tagged receptors, as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The functional integrity of mutant opioid receptors was tested by examining their ability to mediate etorphine-dependent inhibition adenylyl cyclase in intact cells. Stably transfected cells grown in 24-well dishes were preincubated for 15 min with 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and then 5 ॖm forskolin was added to stimulate adenylyl cyclase in the absence or the presence of 5 ॖm etorphine to activate opioid receptors. Cells were extracted with 707 ethanol after 10 min, and cAMP accumulation was quantitated in the extracts using a protein binding radioassay kit (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA), as described previously (13Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemical localization experiments, cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 47 formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and permeabilized using 0.27 Triton X-100 (Sigma). Indirect immunofluorescence staining of FLAG-tagged and HA-tagged receptors was performed using M1 anti-FLAG antibody (3 ॖg/ml, Kodak IBI, New Haven, CT) and 12CA5 antibody (2 ॖg/ml, BAbCO, Berkeley, CA), respectively, using the same methods and fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibodies as described previously (13Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 18von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dual localization of FLAG-tagged κ and HA-tagged δ receptors in the same cells was performed by first staining permeabilized cells with 12CA5 antibody (2 ॖg/ml) to detect HA-tagged δ receptors, washing in PBS, and detecting bound 12CA5 antibody with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (5 ॖg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Malvern, PA). Stained cells were then washed in PBS and incubated in 107 normal mouse serum to block residual anti-mouse binding sites, and FLAG-tagged κ receptors were detected by incubating with M1 anti-FLAG antibody that had been directly conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) by standard methods. A similar staining protocol was used to separately detect FLAG-tagged opioid receptors and HA-tagged dynamin constructs co-expressed in the same cells. Antibody uptake experiments were conducted by a modification of a procedure described previously (13Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18448-18452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). M1 anti-FLAG antibody was added to the culture medium (4 ॖg/ml), cells were then incubated for 30 min in the presence or the absence of agonist, and then cells were fixed in 47 formaldehyde dissolved in PBS. Endocytosed antibody was detected by staining permeabilized coverslips with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (5 ॖg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Stained specimens were examined by conventional epifluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a 60× NA1.4 objective and standard fluorescein/Texas Red dichroic filter sets. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC1000 confocal microscope equipped with a Zeiss 100× NA1.3 objective. After appropriate treatments of cells grown on plastic dishes at 37 °C, dishes were equilibrated to 4 °C, cells were lifted from the dishes by incubation in ice-cold calcium-free PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, and suspended cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated M1 anti-FLAG antibody (10 ॖg/ml) in isotonic medium containing 107 fetal bovine serum for 60 min to label epitope-tagged receptors present in the plasma membrane. Cells were washed in PBS to remove residual unbound antibody, and receptor staining intensity was measured by fluorescence flow cytometry using a FACScan instrument (Becton Dickenson, Palo Alto, CA). Gating of live cells by propidium iodide and light scatter and data analysis to quantitate changes in mean surface receptor fluorescence values were performed using CellQuest software (Becton Dickenson). Functional expression of epitope-tagged murine δ and ॖ opioid receptors was reported previously (13Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged κ receptors were constructed in the same manner. The functional activity of tagged κ receptors was confirmed by measuring etorphine-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in transfected human 293 cells. Epitope-tagged κ receptors strongly inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in transfected cells when exposed to saturating concentrations of etorphine (5 ॖm), whereas minimal etorphine-induced inhibition was observed in untransfected cells (Table I, middle column). Examination of the concentration dependence of this inhibition indicated that etorphine activates epitope-tagged κ receptors with high potency. The IC50 for etorphine-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase measured in cells expressing FLAG-tagged κ receptors was 4.9 nm (Table I, right column). This high potency is similar to that reported previously for etorphine-induced activation of wild-type opioid receptors examined both in natively expressing and transfected cell types (10Law P.-Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 72: 1-4Google Scholar, 11Law P.-Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4096-4104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Raynor K. Kong H. Chen Y. Yasuda K. Yu L. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 330-334PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, this potency is similar to that for causing inhibition of adenylyl cyclase mediated by epitope-tagged δ receptors expressed in 293 cells (TableI, right column, and Ref. 13Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that epitope-tagged κ receptors are functional opioid receptors that retain their ability to be activated with high potency by etorphine. Because of its comparable potency for activation of both epitope-tagged δ and κ receptors, etorphine was used in subsequent studies comparing the membrane trafficking properties of δ, κ, and chimeric mutant receptors.Table IReceptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in transfected 293 cellsReceptor constructInhibition of cAMP accumulationIC507nmNone (untransfected 293)8.1 ± 5.1 (n = 7)FLAG-δ57 ± 6.6 (n = 6)1.8FLAG-κ62 ± 3.9 (n = 6)4.9Cr. 153 ± 8.6 (n = 7)Cr. 252 ± 7.3 (n = 6)Cr. 366 ± 4.7 (n = 6)Cr. 469 ± 7.5 (n = 6)Cr. 519 ± 6.8 (n = 10)Cr. 677 ± 4.1 (n = 6)Etorphine-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was assayed in stably transfected 293 cells expressing the indicated receptor construct, as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 The percentage of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation caused by 5 ॖm etorphine was determined in triplicate for each experiment.

The IC50 listed in the table represents the mean value derived from analysis five separate concentration-inhibition response assays, in which cAMP accumulation at each concentration of etorphine was assayed in triplicate wells. The subcellular distribution of epitope-tagged opioid receptors was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. δ receptors tagged with monoclonal antibody remained in the plasma membrane of untreated cells (Fig. 1 a) and were internalized within several minutes in the presence of etorphine, as indicated by translocation of antibody-tagged receptors to endosomal vesicles located throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 b). κ receptors examined under the same conditions were also observed in the plasma membrane of untreated cells (Fig. 1 c). However, in marked contrast to the readily detectable internalization of δ receptors, κ receptors failed to internalize even after 30 min in the presence of etorphine (Fig. 1 d). No internalization was observed even in the presence of 5 ॖm etorphine, a saturating concentration approximately 1000-fold greater than that required to cause receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (Table I). This type-specific difference in the regulated internalization of δ and κ receptors was confirmed in heterogeneous populations of transfected cells using an antibody uptake assay similar to that developed previously for the study of adrenergic receptors (22Mostafapour S. Kobilka B.K. von Zastrow M. Receptors Transduction. 1996; 6: 151-163PubMed Google Scholar). In control experiments, anti-FLAG antibody did not induce or block internalization of receptors (not shown). No endocytosis of antibody was observed in untransfected cells or in cells expressing receptors tagged with a different epitope (HA) not recognized by the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2 a,HA-δ bars), indicating that antibody uptake observed in this assay was mediated specifically by receptor internalization. δ receptors tagged with the appropriate FLAG epitope mediated little endocytosis of monoclonal antibody in the absence of agonist, whereas agonist-induced internalization of these receptors was indicated by a large and rapid increase in the number of antibody-positive endosomes in cells exposed to etorphine (Fig. 2 a, FLAG-δ bars). In contrast, cells expressing κ receptors tagged with the same epitope tag exhibited little antibody uptake when incubated for 30 min either in the absence or the presence of etorphine (Fig.2 a, FLAG-κ bars). Etorphine at various concentrations (ranging from 1 nm to 10 ॖm, not shown) failed to stimulate internalization of κ receptors even after 60 min of continuous incubation. Type-specific differences in opioid receptor internalization were further confirmed in clonal populations of stably transfected cells using fluorescence flow cytometry to quantitate etorphine-induced removal of receptors from the plasma membrane. Etorphine caused a rapid loss of epitope-tagged δ receptors from the plasma membrane, which could be detected within several minutes and occurred with at½ < 10 min (Fig. 2 b, closed circles). In contrast, etorphine-activated κ receptors examined under the same conditions remained in the plasma membrane without any detectable internalization for >30 min (Fig. 2 b,closed squares). Identical results were observed in multiple clones of stably transfected cells, including those expressing epitope-tagged κ receptors at levels equal to or less than δ receptors (as estimated by comparing receptor staining intensities measured by flow cytometry). These observations suggest that type-specific differences in opioid receptor internalization are not caused by differences in levels of receptor expression but instead reflect intrinsic differences in the endocytic sorting of structurally homologous receptor proteins. Supporting this hypothesis, δ and κ receptors were observed to differ in membrane trafficking even when co-expressed in the same cells. κ and δ receptors were tagged with FLAG and HA epitope tags, respectively, and then visualized in the same transfected cells by dual color confocal microscopy. In the absence of agonist, both δ and κ receptors were observed in the plasma membrane (Fig.3, a and b, respectively). Colocalization of both receptors in the same cells is indicated by yellow staining in the merged image, produced by overlapping green and red fluorescence (Fig. 3 c). In the presence of etorphine, δ receptors were internalized, whereas κ receptors examined in the same cells remained in the plasma membrane and were not translocated to endosomes (Fig. 3, d ande), as confirmed by the separation of green and red fluorescence signals observed in the merged image (Fig.3 f). Previous studies indicate that the internalization of δ and ॖ opioid receptors is sensitive to biochemical inhibitors of clathrin function (13Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V.

Supporting this hypothesis, etorphine-induced internalization of δ receptors was strongly inhibited in cells expressing K44E mutant dynamin I, which specifically blocks endocytosis mediated by clathrin-coated pits (20Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 23van der Bliek Am Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J.

Little etorphine-dependent redistribution of δ receptors from the plasma membrane to endosomal vesicles was observed in cells expressing an HA-tagged version of K44E mutant dynamin (Fig.4, a and b, compare with Fig. 1, a and b), whereas internalization of receptors was readily observed under the same conditions in cells expressing wild-type dynamin I (Fig. 4, c and d). These observations were quantitated using the antibody uptake assay, confirming a specific inhibition of δ receptor internalization in cells expressing K44E mutant dynamin compared with cells not transfected with mutant dynamin or wild-type dynamin I (Fig.5). In contrast, overexpression of wild-type or mutant dynamin had no effect on κ opioid receptors, which remained in the plasma membrane both in untreated and etorphine-treated cells (not shown). These results confirm the hypothesis that δ receptors are internalized by clathrin-coated pits, and they suggest that structurally homologous opioid receptors can be differentially sorted into clathrin-coated pits following activation by the same agonist.Figure 5Quantitation of the inhibition of opioid receptor internalization by K44E mutant dynamin.Etorphine-dependent internalization of FLAG-tagged δ opioid receptors was examined in stably transfected 293 cells using the antibody uptake assay. In cells not transfected with mutant dynamin constructs, etorphine (10 ॖm) caused receptor-mediated endocytosis of monoclonal antibody into numerous endocytic vesicles within 30 min (mock bars). Etorphine-induced uptake of antibody was almost completely abolished in cells expressing K44E mutant dynamin (K44E dynamin bars), indicating marked inhibition of receptor internalization. Expression of wild-type (WT) dynamin I in the same manner did not inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis of antibody (WT dynamin bars).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify receptor domains that determine the type specificity of opioid receptor sorting, we examined a series of chimeric mutant opioid receptors constructed by exchanging corresponding sequences between κ and δ receptors. These studies were feasible because δ and κ receptors share extensive sequence homology, facilitating the construction of functional chimeras that bind relatively nonselective alkaloid ligands such as etorphine (25Blake A.D.

Indeed, chimeric mutant receptors examined in these studies bound etorphine and were functional, as indicated by etorphine-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase in stably transfected cells (Table I). The only exception was Cr. 5, which was significantly impaired in its ability to mediate etorphine-dependent signaling but was included in the analysis because it exhibited very pronounced etorphine-induced internalization (see below). Examination of etorphine-dependent internalization of chimeric mutant receptors in transiently transfected cells (using the vesicle counting assay) and stably transfected cells (by flow cytometry) yielded similar results (Fig. 6, a andb, respectively). These results are summarized in Fig.7, which shows representative fluorescence micrographs of etorphine-treated cells and ranks the etorphine-induced internalization of mutant receptors measured using the quantitative assays.Figure 7Summary of internalization data for the mutant κ/δ opioid receptors.

Replacing the carboxyl tail of the δ receptor with the corresponding sequence from the κ receptor created a chimeric mutant receptor (Cr. 1, Fig. 7), which was functional as determined by etorphine-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (Table I) but which exhibited significantly reduced agonist-induced internalization compared with the δ receptor. This inhibitory effect was readily apparent by fluorescence microscopy and was confirmed both in transiently and stably transfected cells using the antibody endocytosis and flow cytometric assays (Figs. 6 and 7). Interestingly, the converse mutation (Cr. 2) failed to cause etorphine-induced internalization of the κ receptor, even though this chimera was also functional (Table I). Similarly, replacing other portions of κ receptor with the corresponding δ sequence created functional chimeric mutant receptors but failed to promote significant etorphine-induced internalization (Crs. 3 and 4). Although it was not possible to promote etorphine-induced internalization of the κ receptor by replacing any individual domain with δ sequence, replacing the carboxyl-terminal tail in combination with other domains from the δ receptor created chimeric mutant receptors that exhibited significant etorphine-induced internalization. The largest effect was obtained by replacing both the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a middle portion of the receptor protein with the corresponding δ sequence (Cr. 5). This chimeric mutant receptor exhibited etorphine-induced internalization to a similar or even greater extent as the wild-type δ receptor, both in transiently and stably transfected cells (Figs. 6 and 7). This effect on receptor internalization was not unique to this domain. Significant agonist-induced internalization was also observed with a chimeric mutant receptor in which a distinct, nonoverlapping domain of the δ receptor was exchanged in combination with the carboxyl-terminal tail (Cr. 6). Taken together, these results indicate that the carboxyl tail is necessary but not completely sufficient to mediate subtype-specific differences in the regulated internalization of opioid receptors. Additional domain(s) from the δ receptor appear to be necessary, in combination with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail, to promote etorphine-induced internalization of chimeric mutant opioid receptors. We have shown that δ and κ opioid receptors are differentially regulated by rapid endocytosis, even when co-expressed in the same cells and activated by the same agonist. δ receptors were internalized within several minutes in the presence of etorphine, in agreement with previous studies (13Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 15Trapaidze N.

In contrast, κ receptors remained in the plasma membrane and were not internalized when examined under the same conditions and in the same cells, even though both δ and κ receptors mediate etorphine-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by coupling to similar heterotrimeric G proteins (28Reisine T. Law S.F. Blake A. Tallent M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 780: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Significant differences in the membrane trafficking of δ and ॖ receptors were observed over a wide range of etorphine concentrations, including extremely high concentrations, even though etorphine is a relatively nonselective alkaloid agonist that activates δ, ॖ, and κ receptors with comparably high potencies and has been shown previously to strongly stimulate the rapid internalization of δ and ॖ receptors in the same cells (13Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). This observation distinguishes the type specificity of opioid receptor internalization demonstrated in this study from the agonist selectivity of internalization reported in previous studies. The specific inhibition of this internalization process by a dominant-negative mutant dynamin supports the hypothesis that opioid receptors are endocytosed by clathrin-coated pits. This idea, proposed initially from studies using biochemical inhibitors of clathrin function (13Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The present results also indicate that individual, structurally homologous opioid receptors can be sorted into coated pits in a type-specific manner following activation. These results reveal an additional level of complexity in the regulation of opioid receptors by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 8). Although structurally homologous adrenergic and muscarinic receptors have been shown previously to differ in ligand-induced internalization (19von Zastrow M. Link R. Daunt D. Barsh G. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 763-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), opioid receptors constitute the first class of G protein-coupled receptors whose membrane trafficking has been observed to be regulated by dynamin-dependent endocytosis in both an agonist-selective and type-specific manner. An analysis of chimeric mutant κ/δ receptors indicates that the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the receptor protein, which is conserved across species but diverges greatly between individual types of opioid receptor, plays an important role in mediating type-specific differences in receptor internalization. Replacing this domain in the δ receptor with the corresponding κ sequence strongly inhibits etorphine-induced internalization, and this domain from the δ receptor is required for etorphine-induced internalization of all chimeric κ/δ opioid receptors examined. These findings are consistent with a previous study showing that truncations and point mutations within this domain influence receptor trafficking (15Trapaidze N. Keith D.E. Cvejic S. Evans C.J. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 27Cvejic S. Trapaidze N. Cyr C. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4073-4076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this domain from the δ receptor cannot by itself cause etorphine-induced internalization of a functional mutant κ receptor (Cr. 2). These observations indicate that exchanging only the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain between receptors is sufficient to cause a 舠loss of function舡 mutation but not a converse 舠gain of function舡 of etorphine-induced internalization of the corresponding chimera. Thus the regulated membrane trafficking of opioid receptors cannot be fully explained by a single contiguous sequence motif in the receptor protein. Our results suggest that additional divergent domain(s) are required in combination with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain to fully determine type-specific differences in the regulated endocytosis of opioid receptors. These observations suggest that the membrane trafficking of opioid receptors may be regulated by the interaction of multiple cellular proteins with different receptor domains or by the interaction of a single protein with a complex structure comprised of more than one receptor domain. Interestingly, the chimeric mutant receptor that exhibited the largest amount of etorphine-induced internalization in our studies (Cr. 5) appeared to be significantly impaired in signaling via adenylyl cyclase. This observation suggests that structural features of opioid receptors required for regulated endocytosis are distinguishable from those required for ligand-dependent activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. Studies of other G protein-coupled receptors indicate that ligand-dependent internalization can play multiple, important roles in the modulation of cell signaling (32Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bohm S.K. Khitin L.M.

Thus the remarkable selectivity of opioid receptor internalization demonstrated in the present study may be of great importance for understanding type-specific differences in the physiological regulation of opioid receptors following activation by relatively nonselective opiate analgesic drugs. Further studies will be required to elucidate precisely how type-specific endocytosis of opioid receptors influences the selectivity of opioid signaling in vivo. The present studies make a significant contribution toward this goal by identifying, for the first time, a mechanism of receptor endocytosis that can differentially regulate structurally homologous opioid receptors activated by the same alkaloid agonist.

https://openalex.org/W2104203345,"Previous crystallographic and biochemical studies of the hammerhead ribozyme suggest that a metal ion is ligated by thepro-R p oxygen of phosphate 9 and by N7 of G10.1 and has a functional role in the cleavage reaction. We have tested this model by examining the cleavage properties of a hammerhead containing a unique phosphorothioate at position 9. The R p-, but notS p-, phosphorothioate reduces the cleavage rate by 103-fold, and the rate can be fully restored by addition of low concentrations of Cd2+, a thiophilic metal ion. These results strongly suggest that this bound metal ion is critical for catalysis, despite its location ∼20 Å from the cleavage site in the crystal structure. Analysis of the concentration dependence suggests that Cd2+ binds with a K d of 25 ॖm in the ground state and a K d of 2.5 nm in the transition state. The much stronger transition state binding suggests that the P9 metal ion adopts at least one additional ligand in the transition state and that this metal ion may participate in a large scale conformational change that precedes hammerhead cleavage. Previous crystallographic and biochemical studies of the hammerhead ribozyme suggest that a metal ion is ligated by thepro-R p oxygen of phosphate 9 and by N7 of G10.1 and has a functional role in the cleavage reaction. We have tested this model by examining the cleavage properties of a hammerhead containing a unique phosphorothioate at position 9.

The much stronger transition state binding suggests that the P9 metal ion adopts at least one additional ligand in the transition state and that this metal ion may participate in a large scale conformational change that precedes hammerhead cleavage. The catalytic cleavage of an RNA phosphodiester bond to a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate by the hammerhead ribozyme requires the participation of divalent metal ions. McKay and co-workers (1Pley H.W. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) observed a single bound metal ion when Mn2+ or Cd2+ was soaked into hammerhead crystals, with the metal ion in close proximity to the pro-R p-oxygen of the P9 phosphate and N7 of the guanine base at position 10.1 (Fig.1). Previous biochemical experiments suggested that both of these groups were important in hammerhead cleavage: the P9 pro-R p-oxygen was identified in phosphorothioate interference experiments (2Buzayan J.M. van Tol H. Feldstein P.A. Breuning G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4447-4451Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Ruffner D.E. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6025-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and a role for a purine at position 10.1 was implicated in nucleotide substitution experiments (4Ruffner D.E. Stormo G.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10695-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 5Tuschl T. Eckstein F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6991-6994Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). More recently, the N7 of this purine was implicated by the ability of guanine, but not 7-deazaguanine, to efficiently rescue the activity of a ribozyme with an abasic nucleotide at position 10.1 (6Peracchi A. Beigelman L. Usman N. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11522-11527Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These results, taken together, support a model in which binding of a metal ion to the P9 pro-R p-oxygen and the N7 of G10.1 affects catalysis. However, the metal ion site identified in the crystal structure is ∼20 Å from the cleavage site phosphodiester, with no obvious connection to this site. In addition, there are no data directly demonstrating a functional role for the structurally identified metal ion, nor are there quantitative data that indicate how important this metal ion might be for catalysis. Finally, coordination of a metal ion to the pro-S p-oxygen of P9 rather than the pro-R p-oxygen was suggested from crystallographic data with a different ribozyme construct (7Scott W.G. Finch J.T. Klug A. Cell. 1995; 81: 991-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). We have therefore tested this model and quantitated the functional consequences of perturbing this site by substituting thepro-R p- andpro-S p-phosphoryl oxygen atoms at position P9 with sulfur and following catalysis in the presence and absence of Cd2+, a thiophilic metal ion. The results provide strong support for the model and indicate that a metal ion coordinated at thepro-R p position is critical for efficient catalysis. The ribozymes and substrates were prepared by solid phase synthesis (8Wincott F. DiRenzo A. Shaffer C. Tracz D. Workman C. Sweedler D. Gonzalez C. Scaringe S. Usman N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2677-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Variants of each ribozyme containing a phosphorothioate in position 9 were produced by published sulfurization methods (9Iyer R.P. Egan W. Regan J.B. Beaucage S.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 1253-1254Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar), which result in a nearly racemic mixture of RP and SP diastereomers (10Iyer R.P. Philips L.R. Egan W. Regan J.B. Beaucage S.L. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 4693Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar). For HHα1 (SchemeFS1), the two isomers of the P9 phosphorothioate (referred to as thio-P9 R p and thio-P9 S p) were separated by reverse phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BisTris-propane, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane. (11Slim G. Gait M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). When each 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide was digested with snake venom phosphodiesterase, a 12-nucleotide species accumulated, consistent with a phosphorothioate at position 9. Furthermore, the 12-nucleotide species from the second HPLC peak was cleaved more slowly than that from the first peak, suggesting that the second peak is the SP-phosphorothioate isomer (12Burgers P.M.J. Eckstein F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4798-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For HH16 (Scheme FS1), the ribozyme length (38 nucleotides) prevented efficient large scale separation of the thio-isomers. Substrates were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotide concentrations were determined using specific activities for radioactive RNAs and assuming a residue extinction coefficient of 8.5 × 103m−1 for nonradioactive RNAs. MgCl2 and CdCl2 (>99.997) were purchased from Aldrich. Buffers were from Sigma (molecular biology grade). CdCl2 solutions were used immediately after preparation or were made as concentrated, acidic stocks (pH 2) and diluted into buffer immediately prior to use. All reactions were single turnover and were carried out with ribozyme in excess of 5′-end-labeled substrate at 25 °C, in 50 mm buffer (pH 6.5) (PIPES·Na for experiments with HHα1 and BisTris-propane·HCl for experiments with HH16) and 10 mm MgCl2, unless otherwise indicated. The reaction protocols were essentially as described previously (13Hertel K.J. Herschlag D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3374-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 14Clouet-D'Orval B. Uhlenbeck O.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 483-491PubMed Google Scholar). Ribozyme and substrate were annealed prior to initiating reactions by the addition of divalent metal ions. Control reactions varying the final concentration of ribozyme indicated that the substrate was completely bound in all cases. Data were fit to the appropriate kinetic equation using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) or SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) and gave fits withR 2 > 0.99 in all cases. Values ofk 2 varied <257 between independent experiments. Reactions of the HH16 construct containing a phosphorothioate in position 9 yielded biphasic reaction time courses, with each phase corresponding to about half of the total reaction. These time courses were fit to the sum of two independent exponentials, giving independent k 2values for each phase. The fast phase, characterized by ak 2 value nearly identical to that of the unmodified ribozyme, was attributed to the thio-P9 S p isomer, and the slower phase was attributed to the thio-P9 R p isomer based on the results with the resolved HHα1 thio-isomers. The rates and relative amplitudes of the two phases did not change when the annealed ribozyme-substrate complex was diluted by 150-fold (decreasing the ribozyme concentration from 600 to 4 nm) immediately after starting the reaction, arguing against kinetic complexities arising from multimeric ribozyme complexes. Also, the reaction time course did not change when the ribozyme-substrate complex was diluted and chased at the start of the reaction with a large molar excess of an HH16 variant (with G5 replaced by an abasic residue) that binds substrate normally but does not react (6Peracchi A. Beigelman L. Usman N. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11522-11527Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). 2A. Peracchi, L. Beigelman, E. C. Scott, O. C. Uhlenbeck, and D. Herschlag, unpublished results. This suggests that there is no dissociation of the pre-annealed ribozyme-substrate complex even over the longest time courses (48–96 h). Each phase of the time course was ∼10-fold faster at pH 7.5 than at pH 6.5, as expected if each process were limited by the chemical step (15Dahm S.C. Derrick W.B. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13040-13045Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Finally, purification of this phosphorothioate-substituted HH16 by anion exchange HPLC (8Wincott F. DiRenzo A. Shaffer C. Tracz D. Workman C. Sweedler D. Gonzalez C. Scaringe S. Usman N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2677-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) resulted in partial separation of ribozyme forms such that the two phases had identical rate constants to those observed in the racemic mixture but different relative amplitudes (one fraction gave 0.8 of the fast component and 0.2 of the slow, whereas a second fraction gave 0.2 of the fast and 0.8 of the slow). Rates and relative amplitudes of the two phases for reactions in 10 mm Mg2+ did not change upon addition of 0.2 mm EDTA or 2 mm dithiothreitol to the reaction mixture, suggesting that neither kinetic process depended on the presence of contaminating metal ions. In reactions with added Cd2+, the concentration of EDTA carried over from the ribozyme and substrate stocks was <15 nm. We have used two different hammerhead ribozyme constructs, HHα1 and HH16 (Scheme FS1), in testing the role and importance of the metal ion identified in the x-ray crystallographic structure. Each of these ribozymes is kinetically and thermodynamically well characterized (13Hertel K.J. Herschlag D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3374-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar,14Clouet-D'Orval B. Uhlenbeck O.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 483-491PubMed Google Scholar), allowing the chemical cleavage step to be followed. In addition to the added confidence provided by obtaining parallel results with different constructs, specific attributes of each ribozyme were exploited in the experiments described below. The RP- and SP-phosphorothioate isomers at position 9 formed during solid phase synthesis of HHα1 (referred to as thio-P9 R p and thio-P9 S pribozyme, respectively) could be separated by HPLC to give fractions with high enrichment of each isomer. In single turnover reactions with saturating ribozyme, cleavage by the thio-P9 S pribozyme proceeded at the same rate, within error, as that of the unmodified ribozyme (k 2 = 0.7 ± 0.1 min−1; 10 mm Mg2+, 25 °C (pH 6.5)). In contrast, catalysis by the thio-P9 R pribozyme was substantially reduced, with an observed cleavage rate constant of k 2 = 0.028 min−1. This supports the previous qualitative observations of compromised ribozyme function upon substitution of an RP-phosphorothioate at position P9 (2Buzayan J.M. van Tol H. Feldstein P.A. Breuning G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4447-4451Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Ruffner D.E. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6025-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and is consistent with a functional interaction with the pro-R p-, but notpro-S p-, oxygen at position P9. The observed rate decrease of 25-fold upon substitution of the P9 pro-R P-oxygen of HHα1 with sulfur represents a lower limit for the effect of this change on the chemical step. This limit arises because the ribozyme preparation could contain a small amount of phosphate or SP-phosphorothioate contaminant. Because dissociation of bound substrate from HHα1 is fast on the time scale of the reaction ( koffS = 0.4 min−1; (14Clouet-D'Orval B. Uhlenbeck O.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 483-491PubMed Google Scholar)), the substrate can exchange between different ribozyme molecules, even in a single turnover experiment performed with saturating concentrations of ribozyme. A thio-P9 R p preparation contaminated with only 47 of unmodified or thio-P9 S p ribozyme would show a 25-fold rate decrease, even if the thio-P9 R p ribozyme was completely inactive. Consistent with this possibility, lowering the temperature to slow the exchange of substrate between different ribozymes gave a much larger observed effect from the thio-P9 R p substitution (≥500-fold at 4 °C; data not shown). To circumvent this problem, we determined the thio effect using a different hammerhead construct, HH16 (Scheme FS1). Substrate dissociation is immeasurably slow for this ribozyme, with a calculatedt½ of ∼10,000 years (13Hertel K.J. Herschlag D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3374-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Because exchange does not occur on the time scale of the reaction, each substrate molecule is cleaved by whichever ribozyme it initially binds, the thio-P9 S p or thio-P9 R p. Single turnover substrate cleavage should therefore occur in two independent phases, each corresponding to the reaction of one isomer population. As expected, two separate kinetic phases, each corresponding to reaction of about half of the substrate, were observed (Fig.2). The first phase occurs at essentially the same rate as the wild type reaction (TableI) and was assigned as reaction of the thio-P9 S p ribozyme, based on the results with the defined isomers of HHα1 described above. The slow phase was similarly assigned as reaction of the thio-P9 R p ribozyme. (Control experiments supporting this interpretation are described under 舠Methods.舡) The cleavage rate for the slow, thio-P9 R p isomer is 500-fold slower than that for the unmodified ribozyme (Table I). Thus, the effect of this single atom substitution is much larger than was determined using HHα1 under the same conditions. Indeed, it was this paradoxical result that led us to propose the fast exchange model for HHα1 and test it at low temperature, as described above. The results indicate that catalysis by both ribozymes is greatly compromised by this thio substitution.Table IEffect of phosphorothioate substitution at position 9 on the hammerhead cleavage reaction in the presence and absence of Cd2+Metal ionsk 2UnmodifiedThio-P9 S pThio-P9 R pmin −110 mm Mg2+0.070.061.4 × 10−410 mm Mg2+ + 100 ॖm Cd2+0.40.31.2Ratio658500Single-turnover reactions with HH16 in 50 mmBisTris-propane·HCl (pH 6.5), 25 °C.

The large deleterious effect of the RP-phosphorothioate at position 9 was obtained in reactions carried out in the presence of Mg2+, which is a 舠hard舡 divalent metal ion having a low affinity for sulfur (16Jaffe E.K. Cohn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4823-4825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pecoraro V.L. Hermes J.D. Cleland W.W.

To determine if the slow reaction of the thio-P9 R p ribozyme resulted from loss of a metal ion bound at this site, reactions were carried out with low concentrations of Cd2+, a strongly thiophilic metal ion, and with 10 mm Mg2+ present to minimize the effect of Cd2+ at other sites. As shown in Table I, the addition of 100 ॖm Cd2+ increased the cleavage by the thio-P9 R p ribozyme over 104-fold, while having only ∼5-fold effects on the unmodified and thio-A9 S p ribozymes. In addition, in the presence of Cd2+, the thio-P9 R pribozyme reacts at nearly the same rate as the unmodified and thio-P9 S p ribozymes. Thus, the 舠rescue舡 is complete. Similar results were obtained with HHα1 (data not shown). Analogous metal ion rescue has been observed with protein enzymes and other ribozymes (e.g. Refs. 16Jaffe E.K. Cohn M. J. Biol.

The ability to observe efficient rescue strongly suggests that the deleterious effect from the P9 RP-phosphorothioate arose from disruption of a Mg2+ site and indicates that this metal ion is of critical importance for hammerhead function. 3While this manuscript was in preparation, Knollet al.

Y.). 1997; 3: 132-140PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a hammerhead containing the thio-P9 R p-phosphoryl group cleaved 10-fold slower than the corresponding unmodified ribozyme and showed that this deleterious effect could be rescued in 2–3 mmCd2+. The small effect relative to that observed herein could reflect exchange during the reaction, as observed with HHα1, that leads to an overestimate of the cleavage rate of the thio-P9 R p ribozyme. In addition, it is not known if the chemical step is rate-limiting for the three-part hammerhead used by Knoll et al. (25Knoll R. Bald R. Furste J.P. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 132-140PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis could be further complicated because one of the oligonucleotides of the three-part ribozyme can adopt alternative structures (14Clouet-D'Orval B. Uhlenbeck O.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 483-491PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ruffner D.E. Dahm S.A. Uhlenbeck O.C. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 82: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and because Cd2+ may have solubility problems at concentrations of 2–3 mm at pH 8 (27Kragten J. Atlas of Metal-Ligand Equilibria in Aqueous Solution. John Wiley & Sons, New York1978Google Scholar). The dependence of the cleavage rate for the thio-P9 R p and wild type ribozyme was measured as a function of [Cd2+] to determine the apparent metal ion affinity for the P9 site (Fig.3 A). The marked dependence for the thio-P9 R p ribozyme and the shallow dependence for the wild type and thio-P9 S p ribozymes (Fig.3 A and data not shown) indicate that this large effect is specific for the P9 RP-thio-isomer. The Cd2+concentration dependence of k 2(obs) for the thio-P9 R p ribozyme suggests that binding of a single Cd2+, which has an equilibrium constant for dissociation from the ribozyme-substrate complex ofK d = 25 ॖm, is responsible for increasing the activity by ∼104-fold. 4The data of Fig. 3 A also suggest that binding of Cd2+ to a single site on the unmodified ribozyme increases the cleavage rate, but with a 10-fold lower affinity and a 103-fold smaller rate enhancement than observed with the thio-P9 R p ribozyme. Preliminary results suggest that the same metal ion binding site is responsible (A. Peracchi, S. Wang, L. Beigelman, and D. Herschlag, unpublished results). The full observed rate enhancement from Cd2+ addition to the thio-P9 R p ribozyme is therefore used in Fig.3 B to calculate the affinity of the Cd2+ for the P9 site in the transition state ( KdCd‡). The association of this metal ion and its rate effects are summarized in Fig. 3 B. Transition states can be considered as if they were species in equilibrium with ground states, according to transition state theory. This allows the Cd2+ affinity of the transition state to be calculated: the 104-fold faster reaction with Cd2+ bound indicates that Cd2+binds 104-fold stronger to the transition state than to the ground state, corresponding to a dissociation constant, Kd‡, of 2.5 nm. The functional importance of a distinct metal ion observed in the x-ray crystallographic structure of the hammerhead ribozyme (Fig.1 A; Ref. 1Pley H.W. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) has been tested. There is a large deleterious effect from substituting the pro-R p-phosphoryl oxygen at position 9 with sulfur for reactions carried out in Mg2+ alone, and small amounts of Cd2+, a thiophilic metal ion, restore the activity to unmodified levels. These observations provide strong support for an important functional role of this metal ion. Consistent with this interpretation, modification of G10.1, which contains the other ligand observed in the structure, decreases the ability of Cd2+ to rescue the deleterious effect of the thio substitution at P9. 5A. Peracchi, L. Beigelman, and D. Herschlag, unpublished results. The rate decreases by 103-fold upon replacing the P9pro-R p-oxygen with sulfur when Mg2+is the only divalent metal ion. This corresponds to a loss of 4 kcal/mol in transition state stabilization upon loss of a bound metal ion, 6Experiments with varying concentrations of both Mg2+ and Cd2+ indicate that this site is not significantly occupied or blocked by the 10 mmMg2+ used in the experiments herein (A. Peracchi, L. Beigelman, and D. Herschlag, unpublished results). Nevertheless, the slow reaction of the thio-P9 R p ribozyme in the absence of Cd2+ could arise from a small fraction of ribozyme with Mg2+ bound at this site. Thus, the value ofk 2 in Fig. 3 B is an upper limit, and correspondingly, the binding of Cd2+ to the transition state could be stronger than the value of KdCd‡ = 2.5 nmcalculated in Fig. 3 B. rivaling the effects from nucleotide substitution or excision of bases from the conserved hammerhead core (6Peracchi A. Beigelman L. Usman N. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11522-11527Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28McKay D.B. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 395-403PubMed Google Scholar). The P9 metal ion plays a critical role in hammerhead catalysis, despite its large distance from the labile phosphodiester group in the ground state. The ground state Cd2+ affinity of 25 ॖm is similar to that for adenosine 5′-O-thiomonophosphate (K d = 24 ॖm (18Sigel R.K.O. Sigel H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 744-755Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar)). The properties of this metal binding site change dramatically during catalysis. In the transition state, there is a 104-fold increase in Cd2+ affinity, relative to the ground state (Fig. 3 B), corresponding to an additional 5.3 kcal/mol of binding free energy. This large increase suggests that there is at least one additional Cd2+ ligand in the transition state. For comparison, the additional carboxylate ligand of nitrilotriacetate relative to iminodiacetate increases Cd2+ affinity by 5.6 kcal/mol (K d = 10−9.5 and 10−5.4m, respectively (29Sillen L.G. Martell A.E. Stability Constants of Metal-Ion Complexes. Burlington House, London1964Google Scholar)). An alternative model in which the Cd2+ ligands are better positioned in the transition state than in the ground state cannot be ruled out; however, this model would require the observed low nanomolar transition state affinity to be achieved with coordination by only two ligands, the sulfur at P9 and N7 at G10.1. How can this metal ion, which is ∼20 Å from the reactive phosphoryl group in the hammerhead crystal structures (1Pley H.W. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 7Scott W.G. Finch J.T. Klug A. Cell. 1995; 81: 991-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 30Scott W.G. Murray J.B. Arnold J.R.P. Stoddard B.L. Klug A. Science. 1996; 274: 2065-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), exert such a large effect, and what could an additional ligand(s) be? McKay pointed out that the ground state complex observed by crystallography would have to rearrange prior to cleavage to allow an in-line attack and also noted that the observed structure and structural variants with modest conformational rearrangements could not readily account for catalytic interactions or for roles of substituents that had been shown to be functionally important (1Pley H.W. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 28McKay D.B. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 395-403PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the base of G5 is critical for catalysis, yet it engages in no interactions with the rest of the ribozyme (Fig. 1 A). These observations suggest that a large scale conformational rearrangement may be required prior to cleavage. Such a conformational rearrangement could allow formation of additional transition state interaction(s) of the metal ion at P9 and could account for the importance of this metal ion in catalysis. 7In contrast, it has recently been suggested, based on structures of rapidly frozen ribozyme-substrate complexes, that only a small conformational rearrangement is required to achieve the catalytic conformation (30Scott W.G. Murray J.B. Arnold J.R.P. Stoddard B.L. Klug A. Science. 1996; 274: 2065-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, since the crystals become disordered upon cleavage, the rearrangements observed in the crystals may not be on a reaction path that leads to cleavage; an off-pathway structure could also account for the very slow cleavage rate observed in the crystals. It is also possible that the observed structure represents an early intermediate that is on the reaction pathway but still differs substantially from the transition state structure. We present the following speculative model for this conformational transition as a starting point for future discussions. We suggest that domain I rearranges and docks onto the major groove face of domain II. Several functional groups that are important for catalysis are located on the major groove face of domain II. In addition, the widened major groove face of this domain includes thepro-R p-oxygens 5′ of P13 and P14, which are important in the transition state (3Ruffner D.E. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6025-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) 8E. C. Scott and O. C. Uhlenbeck, unpublished results. but appear to lack contacts in the ground state structure. The substantial network of interactions in domain II and the maintenance of the metal ion binding site at P9 and G10.1 in the transition state are consistent with domain II remaining largely unaltered in the transition state and serving as a 舠receptor舡 for domain I. A substantial rearrangement of domain I upon docking could account for the critical catalytic importance of functional groups such as those on G5 that do not make extensive ground state interactions. Finally, we suggest that the core is more packed in the active conformation with extensive interconnections between the conserved residues, consistent with the deleterious effects from removal of individual bases or 2′-hydroxyl groups that are large relative to overall catalysis (6Peracchi A. Beigelman L. Usman N. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11522-11527Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,28McKay D.B. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 395-403PubMed Google Scholar). 9A. Peracchi, L. Beigelman, and D. Herschlag, manuscript in preparation. In summary, a large scale conformational rearrangement may be required for the hammerhead to adopt its catalytic conformation. Subsequent to this conformational change, does the P9 metal ion interact directly at the cleavage site or does it exert its effect indirectly through the folded structure? Establishing the identity of the additional ligand to the metal ion bound at P9 would provide a test of the proposed model and would provide an important constraint for the active conformation of the hammerhead ribozyme.

Consistent with the multi-domain organization of MAGUKs, hDlg consists of three copies of the PDZ (PSD-95/Discs large/zO-1) domain, an SH3 motif, and a guanylate kinase-like domain. In addition, the hDlg contains an amino-terminal proline-rich domain that is absent in other MAGUKs. To explore the role of hDlg in cell signaling pathways, we used human T lymphocytes as a model system to investigate interaction of hDlg with known tyrosine kinases. In human T lymphocyte cell lines, binding properties of hDlg were studied by immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and immune complex kinase assays. Our results show that protein tyrosine kinase activity is associated with the immunoprecipitates of hDlg. Immunoblotting experiments revealed that the immunoprecipitates of hDlg contain p56 lck, a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. The specificity of the interaction is demonstrated by the lack of p59 fyn tyrosine kinase and phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase in the hDlg immunoprecipitates. Direct interaction between hDlg and p56 lck is demonstrated using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of hDlg and recombinant p56 lck expressed in the baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. The p56 lck binding site was localized within the amino-terminal segment of hDlg containing proline-rich domain. In addition, we show in vivo association of hDlg with Kv1.3 channel, which was expressed in T lymphocytes as an epitope-tagged protein using a vaccinia virus expression system. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence of a direct interaction between hDlg and p56 lck tyrosine kinase and suggest a novel function of hDlg in coupling tyrosine kinase and voltage-gated potassium channel in T lymphocytes.

Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). It belongs to a rapidly expanding family of proteins termed MAGUKs (membrane-associated guanylatekinases). MAGUKs are characterized by the presence of distinct protein modules including the PDZ domain, SH3 domain, and guanylate kinase-like domain (3Cho K.-O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The PDZ domains of hDlg have been shown to interact with the carboxyl termini of several proteins including Shaker-type K+ channels and adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein (7Kim E.

Kobayashi S. Okada M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Science. 1996; 272: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Unlike other MAGUKs, hDlg contains a proline-rich amino-terminal domain with two potential SH3 domain binding sites (1Lue A.R. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The presence of these consensus binding sites suggests that hDlg participates in signaling pathways by forming protein complexes via the SH3 domains of other proteins.The Shaker-related channel Kv1.3 plays a critical role in modulating the membrane potential of T lymphocytes (10Chandy K.G.

The Fas-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv1.3 channel is not observed in Jurkat cells lacking p56 lck (JCaM1), suggesting that Kv1.3 channel is phosphorylated by p56 lck tyrosine kinase in vivo (20Szabo I.

It is noteworthy here that the Src tyrosine kinase phosphorylates human Kv1.5 channel and suppresses its channel current in the transfected human embryonic kidney cells (21Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A proline-rich motif within the cytoplasmic domain of Kv1.5 channel has been identified as the binding site for the SH3 domain of Src tyrosine kinase (21Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytoplasmic domain of Kv1.3 channel does not appear to conform to known SH3 binding consensus motifs, which may facilitate its binding to p56 lck tyrosine kinase. Therefore, the mechanism by which p56 lck is recruited to Kv1.3 channel in T lymphocytes remains unknown.In this study, we report that hDlg binds independently to p56 lck tyrosine kinase and Kv1.3 channel in human T lymphocytes. Our results suggest a mechanism by which hDlg could recruit p56 lck to the cytoplasmic domain of Kv1.3 channel in human T lymphocytes.DISCUSSIONActivation of T lymphocytes and their elimination via apoptosis are key events required for the maintenance of immune homeostasis. These events are initiated by the transmission of extracellular signals to the cell interior via distinct transmembrane proteins (30Weiss A. Littman D.R.

A common theme in T cell activation and apoptosis is the immediate and rapid phosphorylation of multiple substrates by Src family tyrosine kinases p56 lck and p59 fyn (32Straus D.B. Weiss A.

In addition to the T cell receptor signaling, p56 lck also mediates signaling through CD28, CD44, and interleukin-2 receptor (37Gibson S. August A. Branch D. Dupont B. Mills G.B. J. Biol.

The data reported in this paper establish direct binding of p56 lck with the human homologue (hDlg) of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein.The interaction between p56 lck and hDlg appears to be constitutive and independent of CD3/T cell receptor-mediated T cell activation. CD3 cross-linking of J77 cells does not appear to affect hDlg interactions with other T cell proteins as assessed by metabolic radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation techniques (data not shown). In vivo, hDlg is not tyrosine phosphorylated when immunoprecipitated from either unstimulated or activated J77 cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, incubation of hDlg immunoprecipitates with ATP induces tyrosine phosphorylation of hDlg (Fig. 1). Although we have not yet identified signaling pathways that can stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of hDlg in vivo, the presence of two potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites located near the protein 4.1-binding domain of hDlg (25Kim A.C. Metzenberg A.B. Sahr K.E. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Genomics. 1996; 31: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) may have important physiological consequences. Phosphorylation of these tyrosines and the effect of this phosphorylation on hDlg-protein 4.1 binding, as well as its effect on the nuclear localization of hDlg, are currently under investigation.The discovery of a ∼56-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein in hDlg immunoprecipitates and in the GST-hDlg precipitated from J77 lysates prompted us to investigate whether hDlg is associated with p56 lck, a Src-like tyrosine kinase. The recombinant p56 lck used in this study was engineered to encode the SH3, SH2, and protein kinase domains (amino acids 53–509) (22Weissenhorn W. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Wiley D.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the p56 lck binding site was localized to the NH2-terminal segment of hDlg (Figs. 3 and 4). Because the proline-rich domain present in the NH2-terminal segment of hDlg contains two potential SH3 binding motifs (1Lue A.R. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This proposal is further supported by the fact that the in vitro interaction between p56 lck and hDlg(N) is relatively weak consistent with the lower affinity of known SH3 domain-mediated interactions (40Yu H.

Although Kv1.3 channels are known to be phosphorylated by p56 lck, the issue of how p56 lck is recruited to these ion channels is not resolved (20Szabo I. Gulbins E. Apfel H. Zhang X. Barth P.

The cytoplasmic domain of Kv1.3 channel lacks consensus proline-rich sequences that might bind the SH3 domain of p56 lck (19Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North A.

However, Kv1.3 channel contains the PDZ domain binding consensus sequence in its COOH terminus cytoplasmic tail and was shown to bind PDZ domain of hDlg as well as its close relative, PSD-95, in neuronal cells (7Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 26Kim E. Cho K.-O. Rothschild A. Sheng M.

Our results provide the first evidence of the in vivo interaction between a MAGUK and Shaker type potassium channel in non-neuronal cells. Because of the lack of a specific antibody against Kv1.3 channel, we used T7 epitope-tagged Kv1.3 channel expressed in T lymphocytes. Immunoprecipitation of hDlg coprecipitated Kv1.3 channel, whereas immunoprecipitation of T7-tagged Kv1.3 channel coprecipitated hDlg (Fig. 5). It is relevant to note here that native Kv1.3 channel expressed in T lymphocytes migrates as a 65-kDa protein (42Cai Y.-C. Douglass J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23720-23727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitation of hDg from metabolically radiolabeled J77 cells coprecipitates a 65-kDa protein that is likely to be Kv1.3 channel (data not shown). These results suggest that hDlg associates with native as well as epitope-tagged Kv1.3 channel expressed in T lymphocytes. In summary, our results are consistent with the possibilities for hDlg to form independent complexes with p56 lck and Kv1.3, although it is intriguing to consider the possibility that hDlg functions as an adaptor protein to bring p56 lck in proximity to Kv1.3 channel and allow the tyrosine phosphorylation to take place. We were, however, unable to verify the latter possibility because the expression of epitope-tagged Kv1.3 channel was very poor in J77 cells, and the endogenous Kv1.3 levels in these cells were below the level of detection by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays.The hDlg transcript and protein isoforms are ubiquitously distributed (1Lue A.R.

Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Although we could not detect binding of hDlg with p59 fyn, it is possible that hDlg associates with other Src family tyrosine kinases in nonhematopoietic cells. Because the proline-rich sequences encoded in the alternatively spliced insertion I-1 in hDlg appear likely to mediate its specific interaction with the SH3 domain of p56 lck, the expression of tissue-specific isoforms of hDlg will likely determine its binding function in a particular tissue. Moreover, the specificity of the hDlg-p56 lck interaction in a given cell type is supported by the fact that hDlg does not bind to other SH3 domain-containing proteins such as p59 fyn and PI 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. Our observation that the complete deficiency of p56 lck in JCaM1 cells does not affect binding of hDlg with Kv1.3 channel is also consistent with the proposed function of hDlg as an adaptor protein coupling Kv1.3 channel to p56 lck in T lymphocytes. The restricted expression of Kv1.3 channel in lymphocytes and brain (19Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Ranton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar) lends credence to our hypothesis that hDlg may link novel tyrosine kinases to potassium channel in lymphocytes as well as in neuronal cells.The hDlg-mediated recruitment of tyrosine kinases to specific sites may couple these critical enzymes to cytoskeletal protein 4.1 and serine/threonine kinases because hDlg immunoprecipitates from J77 cells also contain serine/threonine kinase activity. 2T. Hanada and A. H. Chishti, unpublished data. Consistent with this hypothesis is our previous observation that protein 4.1 binds to hDlg via an alternatively spliced insertion I-3 and that both insertions I-1 and I-3 are found together in an hDlg isoform (1Lue A.R. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Whether the hDlg-p56 lck paradigm truly contributes to these related binding issues remains to be investigated. hDlg is the closest human homologue of the Drosophiladiscs large tumor suppressor protein (1Lue A.R.

Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). It belongs to a rapidly expanding family of proteins termed MAGUKs (membrane-associated guanylatekinases). MAGUKs are characterized by the presence of distinct protein modules including the PDZ domain, SH3 domain, and guanylate kinase-like domain (3Cho K.-O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 4Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Mech. Dev. 1993; 44: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). hDlg is a peripheral membrane protein associated with the membrane cytoskeleton presumably via its protein 4.1-binding domain (5Marfatia S.M.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The PDZ domains of hDlg have been shown to interact with the carboxyl termini of several proteins including Shaker-type K+ channels and adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein (7Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 8Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K. Baeg G.-H. Kawahara T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Science. 1996; 272: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Unlike other MAGUKs, hDlg contains a proline-rich amino-terminal domain with two potential SH3 domain binding sites (1Lue A.R. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The presence of these consensus binding sites suggests that hDlg participates in signaling pathways by forming protein complexes via the SH3 domains of other proteins. The Shaker-related channel Kv1.3 plays a critical role in modulating the membrane potential of T lymphocytes (10Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. Grissmer S. Semin.

Many structurally dissimilar peptide and nonpeptide blockers of the Kv1.3 channel inhibit mitogen-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation and interleukin-2 production by T cells in vitro (12Chandy K.G.

These antagonists are thought to chronically depolarize the T cell membrane, reduce calcium entry via calcium-activated release calcium channels in the plasma membrane, and consequently inhibit the calcium signaling pathway essential for lymphocyte activation (10Chandy K.G.

Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Ranton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar) and distinct mechanism of action, Kv1.3 is widely recognized as a therapeutic target for novel immunosuppressive drugs that may prove useful for transplantation therapy as well as for the treatment of autoimmune disorders (16Nguyen Q.A.

The stimulation of Fas receptor leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv1.3 channel and dramatic inhibition of potassium channel current in Jurkat T cells (20Szabo I. Gulbins E. Apfel H. Zhang X. Barth P. Busch A.E. Schlottmann K. Pongs O. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20465-20469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The Fas-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv1.3 channel is not observed in Jurkat cells lacking p56 lck (JCaM1), suggesting that Kv1.3 channel is phosphorylated by p56 lck tyrosine kinase in vivo (20Szabo I. Gulbins E. Apfel H. Zhang X. Barth P. Busch A.E. Schlottmann K. Pongs O. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20465-20469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy here that the Src tyrosine kinase phosphorylates human Kv1.5 channel and suppresses its channel current in the transfected human embryonic kidney cells (21Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A proline-rich motif within the cytoplasmic domain of Kv1.5 channel has been identified as the binding site for the SH3 domain of Src tyrosine kinase (21Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytoplasmic domain of Kv1.3 channel does not appear to conform to known SH3 binding consensus motifs, which may facilitate its binding to p56 lck tyrosine kinase. Therefore, the mechanism by which p56 lck is recruited to Kv1.3 channel in T lymphocytes remains unknown. In this study, we report that hDlg binds independently to p56 lck tyrosine kinase and Kv1.3 channel in human T lymphocytes. Our results suggest a mechanism by which hDlg could recruit p56 lck to the cytoplasmic domain of Kv1.3 channel in human T lymphocytes. DISCUSSIONActivation of T lymphocytes and their elimination via apoptosis are key events required for the maintenance of immune homeostasis. These events are initiated by the transmission of extracellular signals to the cell interior via distinct transmembrane proteins (30Weiss A. Littman D.R.

A common theme in T cell activation and apoptosis is the immediate and rapid phosphorylation of multiple substrates by Src family tyrosine kinases p56 lck and p59 fyn (32Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 33Eischen C.M. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1947-1954PubMed Google Scholar, 34Appleby M.W.

Hartmann K.-U. Veillette A. Davidson D. Mak T.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). In addition to the T cell receptor signaling, p56 lck also mediates signaling through CD28, CD44, and interleukin-2 receptor (37Gibson S. August A. Branch D. Dupont B. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7079-7083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 38Taher T.E.I. Smit L. Griffioen A.W. Schilder-Tol E.J.M. Borst J. Pals S.T. J. Biol.

Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The data reported in this paper establish direct binding of p56 lck with the human homologue (hDlg) of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein.The interaction between p56 lck and hDlg appears to be constitutive and independent of CD3/T cell receptor-mediated T cell activation. CD3 cross-linking of J77 cells does not appear to affect hDlg interactions with other T cell proteins as assessed by metabolic radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation techniques (data not shown). In vivo, hDlg is not tyrosine phosphorylated when immunoprecipitated from either unstimulated or activated J77 cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, incubation of hDlg immunoprecipitates with ATP induces tyrosine phosphorylation of hDlg (Fig. 1). Although we have not yet identified signaling pathways that can stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of hDlg in vivo, the presence of two potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites located near the protein 4.1-binding domain of hDlg (25Kim A.C. Metzenberg A.B. Sahr K.E. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Genomics. 1996; 31: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) may have important physiological consequences. Phosphorylation of these tyrosines and the effect of this phosphorylation on hDlg-protein 4.1 binding, as well as its effect on the nuclear localization of hDlg, are currently under investigation.The discovery of a ∼56-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein in hDlg immunoprecipitates and in the GST-hDlg precipitated from J77 lysates prompted us to investigate whether hDlg is associated with p56 lck, a Src-like tyrosine kinase. The recombinant p56 lck used in this study was engineered to encode the SH3, SH2, and protein kinase domains (amino acids 53–509) (22Weissenhorn W. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Wiley D.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the p56 lck binding site was localized to the NH2-terminal segment of hDlg (Figs. 3 and 4). Because the proline-rich domain present in the NH2-terminal segment of hDlg contains two potential SH3 binding motifs (1Lue A.R. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to the T cell receptor signaling, p56 lck also mediates signaling through CD28, CD44, and interleukin-2 receptor (37Gibson S. August A. Branch D. Dupont B. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7079-7083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 38Taher T.E.I. Smit L. Griffioen A.W. Schilder-Tol E.J.M. Borst J. Pals S.T. J. Biol.

Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The data reported in this paper establish direct binding of p56 lck with the human homologue (hDlg) of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein. The interaction between p56 lck and hDlg appears to be constitutive and independent of CD3/T cell receptor-mediated T cell activation. CD3 cross-linking of J77 cells does not appear to affect hDlg interactions with other T cell proteins as assessed by metabolic radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation techniques (data not shown). In vivo, hDlg is not tyrosine phosphorylated when immunoprecipitated from either unstimulated or activated J77 cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, incubation of hDlg immunoprecipitates with ATP induces tyrosine phosphorylation of hDlg (Fig. 1). Although we have not yet identified signaling pathways that can stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of hDlg in vivo, the presence of two potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites located near the protein 4.1-binding domain of hDlg (25Kim A.C. Metzenberg A.B. Sahr K.E. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Genomics. 1996; 31: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) may have important physiological consequences. Phosphorylation of these tyrosines and the effect of this phosphorylation on hDlg-protein 4.1 binding, as well as its effect on the nuclear localization of hDlg, are currently under investigation. The discovery of a ∼56-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein in hDlg immunoprecipitates and in the GST-hDlg precipitated from J77 lysates prompted us to investigate whether hDlg is associated with p56 lck, a Src-like tyrosine kinase. The recombinant p56 lck used in this study was engineered to encode the SH3, SH2, and protein kinase domains (amino acids 53–509) (22Weissenhorn W. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Wiley D.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the p56 lck binding site was localized to the NH2-terminal segment of hDlg (Figs. 3 and 4). Because the proline-rich domain present in the NH2-terminal segment of hDlg contains two potential SH3 binding motifs (1Lue A.R. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 9Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), it appears likely that the hDlg-p56 lck interaction is mediated by the direct binding of SH3 domain of p56 lck with the proline-rich sequences of hDlg. This proposal is further supported by the fact that the in vitro interaction between p56 lck and hDlg(N) is relatively weak consistent with the lower affinity of known SH3 domain-mediated interactions (40Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Our results provide evidence of the direct association of a tyrosine kinase with a member of the MAGUK family and may have important physiological consequences. hDlg may play a role in tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv1.3 channel in T cells (41Grissmer S. Dethlefs B. Wasmuth J.J. Goldin A.L. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9411-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although Kv1.3 channels are known to be phosphorylated by p56 lck, the issue of how p56 lck is recruited to these ion channels is not resolved (20Szabo I. Gulbins E. Apfel H. Zhang X. Barth P. Busch A.E. Schlottmann K. Pongs O. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20465-20469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of Kv1.3 channel lacks consensus proline-rich sequences that might bind the SH3 domain of p56 lck (19Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Ranton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar), in the way that Kv1.5 directly binds to the SH3 domain of Src tyrosine kinase (21Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, Kv1.3 channel contains the PDZ domain binding consensus sequence in its COOH terminus cytoplasmic tail and was shown to bind PDZ domain of hDlg as well as its close relative, PSD-95, in neuronal cells (7Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 26Kim E. Cho K.-O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Our results provide the first evidence of the in vivo interaction between a MAGUK and Shaker type potassium channel in non-neuronal cells. Because of the lack of a specific antibody against Kv1.3 channel, we used T7 epitope-tagged Kv1.3 channel expressed in T lymphocytes. Immunoprecipitation of hDlg coprecipitated Kv1.3 channel, whereas immunoprecipitation of T7-tagged Kv1.3 channel coprecipitated hDlg (Fig. 5). It is relevant to note here that native Kv1.3 channel expressed in T lymphocytes migrates as a 65-kDa protein (42Cai Y.-C. Douglass J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23720-23727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitation of hDg from metabolically radiolabeled J77 cells coprecipitates a 65-kDa protein that is likely to be Kv1.3 channel (data not shown). These results suggest that hDlg associates with native as well as epitope-tagged Kv1.3 channel expressed in T lymphocytes. In summary, our results are consistent with the possibilities for hDlg to form independent complexes with p56 lck and Kv1.3, although it is intriguing to consider the possibility that hDlg functions as an adaptor protein to bring p56 lck in proximity to Kv1.3 channel and allow the tyrosine phosphorylation to take place. We were, however, unable to verify the latter possibility because the expression of epitope-tagged Kv1.3 channel was very poor in J77 cells, and the endogenous Kv1.3 levels in these cells were below the level of detection by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays. The hDlg transcript and protein isoforms are ubiquitously distributed (1Lue A.R. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), whereas p56 lck expression is restricted largely to T cells (32Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Although we could not detect binding of hDlg with p59 fyn, it is possible that hDlg associates with other Src family tyrosine kinases in nonhematopoietic cells. Because the proline-rich sequences encoded in the alternatively spliced insertion I-1 in hDlg appear likely to mediate its specific interaction with the SH3 domain of p56 lck, the expression of tissue-specific isoforms of hDlg will likely determine its binding function in a particular tissue. Moreover, the specificity of the hDlg-p56 lck interaction in a given cell type is supported by the fact that hDlg does not bind to other SH3 domain-containing proteins such as p59 fyn and PI 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. Our observation that the complete deficiency of p56 lck in JCaM1 cells does not affect binding of hDlg with Kv1.3 channel is also consistent with the proposed function of hDlg as an adaptor protein coupling Kv1.3 channel to p56 lck in T lymphocytes. The restricted expression of Kv1.3 channel in lymphocytes and brain (19Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Ranton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar) lends credence to our hypothesis that hDlg may link novel tyrosine kinases to potassium channel in lymphocytes as well as in neuronal cells. The hDlg-mediated recruitment of tyrosine kinases to specific sites may couple these critical enzymes to cytoskeletal protein 4.1 and serine/threonine kinases because hDlg immunoprecipitates from J77 cells also contain serine/threonine kinase activity. 2T. Hanada and A. H. Chishti, unpublished data. Consistent with this hypothesis is our previous observation that protein 4.1 binds to hDlg via an alternatively spliced insertion I-3 and that both insertions I-1 and I-3 are found together in an hDlg isoform (1Lue A.R. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Whether the hDlg-p56 lck paradigm truly contributes to these related binding issues remains to be investigated. We thank Drs. M. Eck and W. Xu of the Children's Hospital (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) for the generous gift of human p56 lck produced in a baculovirus expression system.

Using the yeast two-hybrid screen, we have isolated a rat clone that interacts with Rab3A as well as with Rab1. The gene encodes a 20.6-kDa protein with two extensive hydrophobic domains and is broadly expressed in all tissues. This protein binds to prenylated Rab GTPases but not to other small Ras-like GTPases such as the Rho/Rac family. This prenylated Rab acceptor (PRA1) also binds specifically to the synaptic vesicle protein VAMP2 (or synaptobrevin II) but shows no affinity for VAMP1 or cellubrevin in both the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding assays. This specificity resides, in part, in the proline-rich domain of VAMP2 as a chimera containing this domain of VAMP2 fused to VAMP1 is able to bind to PRA1. The transmembrane domain of VAMP2 is also essential as its deletion abolished binding to PRA1. Replacement of the deleted VAMP2 transmembrane domain by a CAAX prenylation signal can not restore binding to PRA1. This interaction is therefore distinct from that required for VAMP2 binding to either syntaxin or both syntaxin and SNAP-25. Deletion analysis on PRA1 indicates that the critical Rab- and VAMP2-interacting residues reside in two regions: the amino-terminal residues 30–54 and the extreme carboxyl-terminal domain. This dual Rab and VAMP2 binding characteristic suggests that PRA1 may serve to link these two protein families in the control of vesicle docking and fusion.

The Rab family of GTPases plays a regulatory role in the intracellular transport of vesicles by cycling through GTP- and GDP-bound states (1Bourne H.R.

Novick P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1993; 361: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and Rab3 GDP/GTP exchange protein or GEP (7Wada M. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Hirano H. Obaishi H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3875-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mss4 promotes guanine nucleotide exchange in a subset of Rab proteins (8Burton J.L. Burns M.E. Gatti E. Augustine G.J. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5547-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), whereas Rab3 GEP is specific to the Rab3 subfamily (7Wada M. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Hirano H. Obaishi H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3875-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Moreover, the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Mss4 does not appear to be influenced by Rab prenylation (8Burton J.L. Burns M.E. Gatti E. Augustine G.J. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5547-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Miyazaki A. Sasaki T. Araki K. Ueno N. Imazumi K. Nagano F. Takahashi K. Takai Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in contrast to the Rab3 GEP. The specificity of these guanine nucleotide exchange proteins raises the possibility that each Rab or Rab subfamily may possess a unique set of proteins catalyzing guanine nucleotide exchange and membrane localization. The GTP-bound Rab associated with the membrane is thought to ensure proper docking and fusion of transport vesicles. The precise mechanism by which the Rab GTPase mediates vesicle fusion remains unclear, but it appears to be required for the assembly of the SNARE fusion complexes (10Søgaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R.

This modification is thought to promote membrane localization and is essential for biological function. Prenylation involves the addition of either farnesyl (15-carbon) or geranylgeranyl (20-carbon) moiety catalyzed by three distinct prenyl transferases exhibiting characteristic prenoid and protein substrate specificity (14Seabra M.C.

Farnesyl transferase and geranylgeranyl transferase I are responsible for the prenylation of GTPases containing the characteristic CAAX motif at the carboxyl terminus. Most members of the Rab family, however, are modified by the addition of two GG moieties by geranylgeranyl transferase II. This modification requires presentation of newly synthesized Rab by a Rab escort protein (REP), a protein that is defective in the retinal degenerative disease choroideremia (19Andres D.A.

Rab3 is a member of the Rab subfamily associated with regulated secretory vesicles undergoing fusion with the plasma membrane. There are currently four Rab3 isoforms (A, B, C, and D). Rab3A, -B, and -C are found predominantly in the brain (21Matteoli M. Takei K. Cameron R. Hurlbut P. Johnston P.A. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J.

Nature. 1993; 364: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar); Rab3D is found in cells such as adipocytes (25Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). There is evidence to suggest that the different Rab3 isoforms may be functionally distinct. Transgenic knockout of Rab3A, the major brain isoform, does not completely abolish synaptic vesicle fusion but indicates that the protein plays a significant regulatory role (26Geppert M. Bolshakov V.Y. Siegelbaum S.A. Takei K. DeCamilli P. Hammer R.E. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In contrast, antisense oligonucleotides knockdown of Rab3B appears to inhibit calcium-dependent exocytosis in anterior pituitary cells (24Lledo P.M. Vernier P. Vincent J.D. Mason W.T. Zorec R. Nature. 1993; 364: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In chromaffin and PC12 cells, Rab3A appears to be an inhibitor of secretion (27Holz R.W. Brondyk W.H. Senter R.A. Kuizon L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10229-10234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while Rab3B plays a stimulatory role (28Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).To determine the mechanism by which Rab GTPases mediate synaptic vesicle trafficking, we have initiated a yeast two-hybrid screen (29Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) for proteins interacting with Rab3A (22Fischer von Mollard G. Mignery G.A. Baumert M.

In addition to REP and GDI, other proteins are known to interact with Rab3 or other Rab proteins. Rabphilin-3A, a protein with two C2 domains, binds the GTP-bound form of Rab3 (30Shirataki H.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and its interaction with α-actinin may serve to link Rab3 function to actin bundling (31Kato M. Sasaki T. Ohya T. Nakanishi H. Nishioka H. Imamura M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31775-31778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Rabin-3 interacts with a subset of Rab3 GTPases through the putative effector domain (32Brondyk W.H. Mckiernan C.J. Fortner K.A. Stabila P. Holz R.W. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1137-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a GTPase-activating protein has been described for Rab3A (33Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4655-4658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We describe here a Rab-interacting protein isolated from rat brain that is homologous to a partial mouse Rab5/6-interacting clone described previously (34Janoueix-Lerosey I. Jollivet F. Camonis J. Marche P.N. Goud B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14801-14808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This protein is broadly expressed in all tissues and only binds to the prenylated form of Rab GTPases. Interestingly, it also binds specifically to the synaptic vesicle protein VAMP2 or synaptobrevin II. We hypothesize that this dual binding may serve to link these two families of proteins in the control of vesicle docking and fusion.DISCUSSIONThe PRA1 clone was isolated as a Rab3A-interacting clone in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat brain cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts that PRA1 contains at least two extensive hydrophobic domains. These may form a membrane-spanning domain or the inner hydrophobic core of the protein. Sequence comparison revealed that PRA1 is homologous to the yeast gene YIP3 with sequence similarities localized to regions adjacent to the two hydrophobic domains. The yeast Yip3p also contains two extended hydrophobic domains and an overall acidic carboxyl-terminal end. This similarity raises the possibility that PRA1 and Yip3p may share a common function in mediating vesicular transport. Moreover, it is consistent with the observation that proteins involved in the secretory pathway are often conserved from yeast to mammals (46Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 47Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Annu. Rev.

It has been shown previously to interact with Rab5 and Rab6 (34Janoueix-Lerosey I. Jollivet F. Camonis J. Marche P.N. Goud B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14801-14808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and we showed here that it also interacts with Rab3A and Rab1. Binding requires modification of the Rab protein by a prenoid group as deletion of the double cysteine (CXC or CC) prenylation motif completely abrogated Rab interaction. It appears to bind equally well to farnesylated and mono-GG modified Rab. Recognition of Rab GTPases by PRA1 is not limited to the prenyl group. Indeed, PRA1 must also recognize domain(s) common to the Rab family of GTPases since other prenylated Ras-like GTPases such as RhoA and Rac1 do not interact with PRA1. This suggests that PRA1 is functionally limited to the Rab GTPases. Because PRA1 does not appear to exhibit specificity toward the different Rab GTPases, it is unlikely to be directly responsible for specific membrane localization of the diversely targeted Rab GTPases. It is more plausible that PRA1 is involved in mediating a function common to all Rab GTPases. Our results indicating that PRA1 binds specifically to VAMP2 suggest that this Rab-interacting protein is likely to be a factor mediating the action of the Rab GTPase to the SNARE complexes.The interaction between PRA1 and VAMP2 is distinct from that of VAMP and Syn1A in many ways. First, Syn1A binds equally well to both VAMP1 and VAMP2 (45Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) whereas only VAMP2 interacts with PRA1 in the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding assays. This specificity exhibited by PRA1 toward VAMP2 raises the possible existence of isoforms of PRA1 that may be involved in binding to VAMP1 and cellubrevin. Second, the cytoplasmic domain of VAMP is sufficient for Syn1A binding (45Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The domains responsible for VAMP and Syn1A binding have been localized to the conserved cytoplasmic domain of VAMP and the cytoplasmic domain adjacent to the TMD in Syn1A. Moreover, deletion of the TMD in VAMP does not appear to affect its interaction with Syn1A. In contrast, PRA1 interaction with VAMP2 requires an intact hydrophobic domain in the VAMP molecule. The TMD is essential and cannot be substituted by an alternate mean of membrane insertion such as through the addition of a prenyl group from an engineered CAAX motif. The requirement of a TMD for protein function is not without precedence. For example, modification of the gating properties of calcium channels by syntaxin 1A resides predominantly in the TMD (48Bezprozvanny I. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 49Wiser O. Bennett M.K. Atlas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4100-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), whereas its interaction with VAMP resides in a cytosolic domain immediately adjacent to the TMD and is independent on the TMD. Third, the amino-terminal proline-rich domain of VAMP2 appears to be partially responsible for the specificity of interaction between the two proteins. Sequence comparison between the two VAMP isoforms indicates that there is considerable divergence within the amino-terminal proline-rich domain. The ability of PRA1 to interact with a hybrid protein containing the amino-terminal 31 amino acids of VAMP2 fused to the remaining VAMP1(34–118) indicates that this proline-rich domain in conjunction with the hydrophobic domain are likely to be the two main factors conferring specificity toward PRA1 and VAMP2 binding. This interaction is therefore distinct from the binding of VAMP2 to either Syn1A or both Syn1A and SNAP-25 which involves the conserved domain region of VAMP2 (50Hao J.C. Salem N. Peng X.R. Kelly R.B. Bennett M.K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions in VAMP2 that either enhanced or inhibited its sorting to synaptic vesicles (44Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 51Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) exhibited a strong effect on binding to Syn1A and SNAP-25 (50Hao J.C. Salem N. Peng X.R. Kelly R.B. Bennett M.K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but showed no effect on interaction with PRA1. This suggests that PRA1 is not likely to be directly responsible for membrane targeting or sorting of VAMP2. It remains to be determined whether binding of PRA1 to VAMP2 may impede the formation of binary or ternary complexes with Syn1A and/or SNAP-25 and vice versa.Deletion analysis of PRA1 indicates that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains are essential for binding to Rab3A and VAMP2. The minimal amino-terminal domain lies within residues 30–54 and the carboxyl-terminal domain spans the last 10 amino acids. It is interesting to note that similarity to the yeast Yip3p extends over residues 36–102 of PRA1, and suggests a possible conservation of structure and function. A notable feature of this domain is the abundance of arginine residues. In contrast to the basic nature of the minimal amino-terminal domain, the carboxyl-terminal domain of PRA1 is rich in glutamate. Deletion or substitution of this carboxyl-terminal domain also abolished binding to both Rab3A and VAMP2 in the two-hybrid system, and to VAMP2 in in vitro binding assays. It is unlikely that the interaction between PRA1 and VAMP2 is due to nonspecific binding between the hydrophobic domains of the two proteins. Both VAMP1 and cellubrevin contain a similar hydrophobic domain at the carboxyl terminus, yet failed to bind to the full-length or truncated PRA1. Furthermore, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain of PRA1 leaves the two hydrophobic domains intact, yet binding to VAMP2 was significantly diminished. When combined with the results from the yeast two-hybrid system, it would appear that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal segments flanking the two hydrophobic domains are essential for protein-protein interaction. The extensive overlap in the PRA1 domains involved in Rab3A and VAMP2 binding raises the possibility that these two proteins may compete for the same binding site in PRA1, and is consistent with the observation that proteins in the secretory pathway often interact with multiple partners. One would predict that binding of PRA1 to the Rab GTPase will likely influence VAMP2 binding and vice versa.How might a protein showing little or no specificity toward the different Rab proteins but highly specific for VAMP2 be involved in regulating vesicular transport? We envision that PRA1 may play a role in regulating the interaction between VAMP2 and the t-SNARE proteins. One possibility is that PRA1 binding to VAMP2 may prevent premature interaction with the t-SNARE proteins. Recruitment of the Rab GTPase to the correct membrane compartment, and its binding to PRA1 may serve to disrupt PRA1 and VAMP2 interaction. This consequently frees VAMP2 to interact with components of the t-SNARE complex leading to vesicle docking and fusion. Hydrolysis of the bound GTP in the Rab GTPase and its subsequent extraction from the membrane by GDI may serve to trigger binding of PRA1 to VAMP2. Based on this scenario, the membrane cycling of Rab as governed by the bound guanine nucleotide may serve to regulate the availability of VAMP2 to interact with and mediate formation of the SNARE complexes through its binding to PRA1. Further studies are required to understand the role of the Rab GTPases and PRA1 in the formation of the SNARE complexes. The Rab family of GTPases plays a regulatory role in the intracellular transport of vesicles by cycling through GTP- and GDP-bound states (1Bourne H.R.

Novick P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1993; 361: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and Rab3 GDP/GTP exchange protein or GEP (7Wada M. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Hirano H. Obaishi H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3875-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mss4 promotes guanine nucleotide exchange in a subset of Rab proteins (8Burton J.L. Burns M.E. Gatti E. Augustine G.J. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5547-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), whereas Rab3 GEP is specific to the Rab3 subfamily (7Wada M. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Hirano H. Obaishi H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3875-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Moreover, the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Mss4 does not appear to be influenced by Rab prenylation (8Burton J.L. Burns M.E. Gatti E. Augustine G.J. De Camilli P.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in contrast to the Rab3 GEP. The specificity of these guanine nucleotide exchange proteins raises the possibility that each Rab or Rab subfamily may possess a unique set of proteins catalyzing guanine nucleotide exchange and membrane localization. The GTP-bound Rab associated with the membrane is thought to ensure proper docking and fusion of transport vesicles. The precise mechanism by which the Rab GTPase mediates vesicle fusion remains unclear, but it appears to be required for the assembly of the SNARE fusion complexes (10Søgaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R.

The Rab GTPases are post-translationally modified by the addition of a prenoid moiety to the characteristic cysteine-containing motif at the carboxyl terminus (11Moores S.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D.

Farnesyl transferase and geranylgeranyl transferase I are responsible for the prenylation of GTPases containing the characteristic CAAX motif at the carboxyl terminus. Most members of the Rab family, however, are modified by the addition of two GG moieties by geranylgeranyl transferase II. This modification requires presentation of newly synthesized Rab by a Rab escort protein (REP), a protein that is defective in the retinal degenerative disease choroideremia (19Andres D.A.

Some evidence suggests that these enzymes may function as oligomers; however, little is known about the domain of interaction or the mechanism of oligomerization. In this work, evidence for a functional dimerization between UGTs is provided by studies on mutated forms of UGT2B1. When two inactive forms of UGT2B1 were co-expressed in cell culture, catalytic activity was restored, indicating that UGT2B1 forms functional dimers. To delineate the dimerization domain, inactive fusion proteins containing the amino- or carboxyl-terminal domains of UGT2B1 were generated and expressed with active UGT2B1. Expression of a fusion protein containing only the amino-terminal half of UGT2B1 with active UGT2B1 caused a reduction in UGT2B1 catalytic activity. This reduction in activity was not observed when UGT2B1 was co-expressed with a fusion protein containing only the carboxyl-terminal half of UGT2B1, strongly suggesting that the amino-terminal domain is involved in dimerization. Truncation of the immediate amino terminus of UGT2B1 abolished UGT2B1 activity and dimer formation. Activity was also abolished by an L4R substitution in this region of the mature protein, which is highly conserved in the UGT family. These results indicate that UGTs can interact through their amino-terminal domains to form catalytically active dimers. Possible mechanisms resulting in the formation and stabilization of the UGT2B1 dimer are discussed.

Possible mechanisms resulting in the formation and stabilization of the UGT2B1 dimer are discussed. The UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1The abbreviations used are: UGT, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; EGT, ecdysteroid glucosyltransferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are members of a superfamily of glycosyltransferases that catalyze the covalent conjugation of a variety of aglycone substrates with the glucuronic acid moiety of UDP glucuronic acid. In mammals, these are important detoxifying enzymes that render lipophilic substrates, both endogenous and exogenous, more polar and thus more readily excreted in bile or urine (1Burchell B. Coughtrie M.W.H. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 43: 261-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 2Owens I.S. Ritter J.K. Pharmacogenetics. 1992; 2: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3Mackenzie P.I. Rev. Biochem. Toxicol. 1995; 11: 29-72Google Scholar). UGTs reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and demonstrate type I topology such that the amino terminus and approximately 957 of the subsequent residues are located in the lumen, a 17-residue domain near the carboxyl terminus spans the membrane, and the carboxyl-terminal 19–24 residues are located in the cytoplasm. The mammalian UGT isoforms have been separated into two families on the basis of sequence similarity and gene structure. The family 1 UGT isoforms (UGT1) are all encoded by one gene that has multiple unique exons located upstream of four common exons. The isoforms are generated by differential splicing of one unique exon 1 to the four common exons (exons 2–5). The first exon encodes roughly two-thirds of the lumenal domain (approximately 290 amino acids), and exons 2–5 encode the remainder of the lumenal domain, the transmembrane domain, and the cytosolic tail. As a consequence of the unusual gene structure and splicing mechanism, the UGT1 forms have variable amino-terminal halves and identical carboxyl-terminal halves (4Ritter J.K. Chen F. Sheen Y.Y. Tran H.M. Kimura S. Yeatman M.T. Owens I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3257-3261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The UGT2 family differs in that each member is encoded by a separate gene comprised of six exons. However, the region of the protein encoded by exons 1 and 2 is equivalent to that encoded by the unique exons 1 of the UGT1 isoforms, and the subsequent intron/exon boundaries are in corresponding positions in both gene families. Within the UGT2 family, the amino-terminal half of the protein is most variable between isoforms while the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein demonstrates greater sequence conservation. A glycosyltransferase concensus region of approximately 29 amino acids has been defined in the conserved half of UGT and is thought to be involved in binding UDP, based on similarity in this region between UGTs and other enzymes that bind UDP-sugars (5Mackenzie P.I. Ruckpaul K. Rein H. Frontiers in Biotransformation: Vol. 2, Principles, Mechanisms, and Biological Consequences of Induction. Academie-Verlag, Berlin1990: 211-243Google Scholar). Studies with chimeric UGTs have demonstrated that the amino-terminal half of UGT determines substrate specificity and may therefore contain the aglycone binding site (6Mackenzie P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3432-3435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental evidence suggests that UGT may form a dimer or tetramerin vivo. Peters et al. (7Peters W.H.M. Jansen P.L.M. Nauta H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11701-11705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that UGT1A1 may act as both a dimer and a tetramer based on radiation inactivation analysis of the enzyme. Gschaidmeier and Bock (8Gschaidmeier H. Bock K.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1545-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have also examined radiation inactivation of microsomal UGTs and suggested that monoglucuronidation of phenols may be catalyzed by a dimeric form of UGT while diglucuronidation is catalyzed by a tetramer. Matern et al. (9Matern H. Matern S. Gerok W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7422-7429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), analyzed UGT by gel filtration, which also indicated that the enzyme exists in oligomeric forms. However, gel filtration of membrane-bound proteins can give unreliable estimates of molecular weight. Recently, Koiwai et al. (10Koiwai O. Aono S. Adachi Y. Kamisako T. Yasui Y. Nishizawa M. Sato H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) demonstrated that an inactive mutant form of UGT1A1 could act as a dominant negative mutantin vitro, reducing bilirubin activity, presumably by dimerizing with the active form of the enzyme. The region of the UGT protein that is involved in dimerization is unknown. The aim of this study was to demonstrate functional dimerization in UGT2B1 and to determine whether dimerization occurs in the conserved or variable domain of the protein. Goat anti-mouse UGT antiserum, which recognizes all UGT isoforms, has been previously described (11Mackenzie P.I. Hjelmeland L.M. Owens I.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 231: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-goat antibody and anti-goat horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-goat HRP complex were purchased from Dako Corp. (Carpintera, CA). The mouse anti-MRGS-6-his antibody and the anti-mouse-HRP conjugate were purchased from Qiagen GmbH (Hilden, Germany) and Sigma, respectively. The UGT2B1 cDNA in the Okyama-Berg expression vector (pCD) has been previously described (12Mackenzie P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6119-6125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fragment of the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus genome containing the egt gene in the pUC19 vector was kindly provided by Dr. L. Miller, Department of Entomology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA. Mutagenesis was performed by two methods. The UGT2B1 cDNA was either subjected to oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH), or alternatively, mutations were generated by polymerase chain reaction. The oligonucleotides used in both methods were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Melbourne, Vic., Australia). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing using the dideoxy chain-termination method (13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared for transfection by the double CsCl gradient method (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chimeric molecules were constructed between UGT2B1 and ecdysteroid glucosyltransferase (EGT) by introducing XhoI restriction sites into the UGT2B1 cDNA at the exon 2/3 boundary and into theegt gene at a corresponding position based on global sequence alignment. The 5′ and 3′ DNA fragments were exchanged, and the resultant chimeric DNAs were subcloned into the pCMV5 expression vector (Dr. M. Stinsky, University of Iowa, IA) for expression in COS7 cells. The signal peptide domain of UGT2B1 was altered by introducing the 6-histidine tag sequence from the pQE vector series (Qiagen GmbH) into the cDNA by restriction fragment exchange. The histidine peptide replaced most of the hydrophobic core of the leader peptide, leaving the initiation methionine and signal peptide cleavage site intact. Signal peptide cleavage during expression in COS7 cells was verified by immunoblotting with an antibody directed toward the 6-His tag sequence. COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), pH 7.0–7.2, supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 107 new born calf serum, and 80 mg/liter gentamycin at 37 °C and 107 CO2. Cells were transfected at approximately 807 confluency by a modification of the DEAE-dextran method (15Mortlock D. Keller E.B. Ziegra C.J. Suter M.M. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1993; 15: 176-180Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) with 15 ॖg of plasmid DNA per 175 mm2 flask. Cells were harvested at approximately 48 h post-transfection with a rubber scraper and washed in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4). COS7 cells were harvested, washed twice with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 0.4 ml HB (0.5 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), and lysed by sonication using a Heat Systems-Ultrasonics sonicator on ice. The samples were then diluted to 0.25 m sucrose with one volume of TE (10 mmTris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 5000 × g to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei. The resulting post-nuclear supernatant was layered over a 0.1-ml cushion of HB and centrifuged at 300,000 × g in a TLA120.2 rotor in the Beckman tabletop centrifuge for 2 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the microsomal pellet was resuspended in sterile distilled water and stored frozen at −70 °C. Microsomes from transfected COS7 cells were diluted to approximately 2 ॖg of protein/ॖl in denaturing buffer (0.57 SDS, 17 ॆ-mercaptoethanol) and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were diluted into 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.5, and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 200 units of Endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs, Labrador, Qld, Australia). The samples were then combined with one-third volume of 77 SDS, 37 glycerol, 157 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.037 bromphenol blue, 180 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.3, and heated to 95 °C for 3 min before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were routinely analyzed by electrophoresis through 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose using an apparatus from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Regents Park, NSW, Australia). Nitrocellulose blots were probed with a polyclonal goat anti-mouse UGT antisera, rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody, and rabbit-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the substrate for chromogenic detection of protein bands that were quantified using a scanning laser densitometer (LKB). UGT activity in transfected COS7 cell microsomes was assayed using 60 ॖm (0.24 ॖCi)14C-testosterone (NEN Life Science Products) and 2 mm UDPGA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2 in a 60-ॖl reaction for 16 h at 37 °C. Duplicate assays were performed. The relative activity of UGT2B1 was calculated by dividing the averaged activity by the amount of UGT2B1 protein expressed. The latter was determined by densitometry as described above. When UGT2B1 was expressed in COS7 cells, the expected 52-kDa protein was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-UGT antiserum. In addition, a high molecular weight band was consistently observed. This band had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 110 kDa and was sometimes accompanied by a slightly smaller band of approximately 100 kDa. The two bands were not endogenous COS7 cell proteins as they did not appear in mock transfected cells (Fig. 1). Aberrations in heterologous expression, which could lead to the production of large UGT-fusion proteins, were considered but discounted. The possibility of premature initiation of transcription from a cryptic promoter upstream of the cDNA or stop codon read-through was excluded by expressing the UGT2B1 cDNA from two different expression vectors, which contain different backbone plasmid sequences, and by introducing additional stop codons downstream of the native stop codon (data not shown). It is likely, therefore, that these bands are not expression artifacts but represent highly stable associations between UGT2B1 and either another protein (hetero-oligomer) or itself (homo-oligomer). The 100-kDa band, which was less intense than the 110-kDa band and less consistent in its expression, does not represent an unglycosylated form of the upper band as both bands remained apparent after deglycosylation with endoglycosidase H (not shown). Both bands demonstrated a mobility shift indicating that they are glycoproteins (or glycoprotein complexes). The lower band could be a moderately detergent stable complex that forms between UGT2B1 and some unknown accessory molecule. It was destabilized by truncation of the cytosolic tail and transmembrane domain (UGT2B1.493), suggesting that the interaction involves these domains of UGT (Fig. 1). The highly stable 110-kDa band was clearly formed by a different mechanism as it was unaffected by truncation of the carboxyl terminus; however, it was abolished by modification of the amino terminus (Fig. 1; 6-His-UGT2B1). Amino-terminal modification of UGT2B1 was achieved by altering the signal peptide with a hydrophilic histidine tag (6-His-UGT2B1). The expressed protein was not recognized by antibodies to the 6-His-tag, indicating that signal peptide cleavage had occurred (not shown). However, the protein was inactive and did not form the 110-kDa complex. The most likely explanation for this functional change in the mature UGT protein is aberrant signal peptide processing as has been reported for signal peptide mutations in other proteins (16Brennan S.O. Myles T. Peach R.J. Donaldson D. George P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Daly M. Bruce D. Perry D.J. Price L. Harper P.L. O'Meare A. Carell R.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The proposed cleavage of UGT2B1 downstream of the normal cleavage site must therefore remove residues that are critical both for activity and for formation of the high molecular weight complex. The 6-His-UGT protein is not discernibly smaller than wild-type UGT2B1, thus the amino-terminal truncation must involve only a few amino acids. The first seven amino acids of the mature UGT are highly conserved, comprising the motif GKhhhWP (where h is a hydrophobic residue, either Val, Leu, or Ile) in almost all isoforms. We therefore investigated the role of this conserved domain by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.2 A). Substitution of the lysine residue with alanine (UGT2B1.K25A) did not affect activity; however, substitution of the second hydrophobic position with the charged residue arginine (UGT2B1.L27R) abolished activity (Fig.2 B). The 110-kDa complex was formed with both mutants. Thus the hydrophobic motif appears to be critical for UGT2B1 function but is not essential for dimer formation.Figure 2Site-directed mutagensis of the amino-terminal conserved domain.

However, the complex was not recognized by an antibody that was directed specifically to the amino-terminal half of UGT2B1 (not shown), suggesting that epitopes in the amino-terminal half of the protein are masked. Most non-covalent protein interactions are abolished during SDS-PAGE resolution. Thus, a likely explanation for the appearance of this highly stable band is that inadvertent covalent cross-linking occurs during expression that stabilizes a naturally occurring UGT2B1 oligomer, probably a dimer, based on the molecular weight. To further investigate the possibility that UGT may homo-oligomerize in the amino-terminal domain, a functional assay was developed. To demonstrate that UGT2B1 acts as a homo-oligomer, two inactive forms of UGT2B1 with different functional defects were examined. UGT2B1.493 is a truncated form of UGT2B1 from which the cytosolic tail and transmembrane domain were removed (18Meech R. Yogalingam G. Mackenzie P.I. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas UGT2B1.L363P is a full-length protein with a point mutation in the UDP-glycosyltransferase concensus region (5Mackenzie P.I. Ruckpaul K. Rein H. Frontiers in Biotransformation: Vol. 2, Principles, Mechanisms, and Biological Consequences of Induction. Academie-Verlag, Berlin1990: 211-243Google Scholar, 19Mackenzie P.I.

Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). Both proteins were inactive when expressed individually in COS cells. In contrast, testosterone glucuronidating activity was detected in COS cells that co-expressed both proteins (Fig. 3 B). Thus a functional interaction must occur between the two proteins that permits partial compensation of each mutation and restoration of activity. These results also indicate that this interaction does not occur between the cytosolic or transmembrane domains of the monomers. Furthermore, UGT2B1.493 forms only the 110-kDa band and not the weaker 100-kDa band, supporting the view that the former band represents a UGT2B1 homo-oligomer. The hypothesis that homo-oligomerization of UGT2B1 is mediated by the amino-terminal half of the molecule was confirmed by analysis of chimeric UGT2B1 fusion proteins. UGT2B1/EGT contains the amino-terminal half of UGT2B1 (exons 1 and 2) fused in frame to the carboxyl-terminal half of the related glycosyltransferase, EGT. Conversely, EGT/UGT2B1 contains the amino-terminal half of EGT fused in frame to the carboxyl-terminal half of UGT2B1 (exons 3–6) (Fig.4 A). These chimeric molecules appeared to be correctly glycosylated when expressed in COS7 cells, indicating that they were translocated into the ER and remained resident in this organelle (Fig. 4 B). The UGT2B1/EGT chimera formed a high molecular mass complex of greater than 120 kDa, which is presumed to be equivalent to the 110-kDa complex associated with UGT2B1 expression. In contrast, EGT/UGT2B1 formed no high molecular mass complexes (Fig. 4 B). The chimeric proteins demonstrated no catalytic capacity, presumably due to incompatibility between the aglycone and UDP-sugar binding domains. Co-transfection of COS7 cells was performed with equimolar amounts of UGT2B1 cDNA and the chimeric expression constructs, and the catalytic activity of UGT2B1 was measured in each transfectant. As the molecular weights of UGT2B1, UGT2B1/EGT, and EGT/UGT2B1 differed substantially, the level of expression of each protein was readily quantitated by densitometric scanning of Western blots. This allowed the relative activity of UGT2B1 to be calculated and permitted the ratio of wild-type to chimeric protein expression to be determined for each transfectant. Co-expression of UGT2B1 with UGT2B1/EGT reduced the relative activity when compared with UGT2B1 expressed alone (Fig. 4 C). This strongly suggests that UGT2B1/EGT interacts with UGT2B1, forming an inactive hetero-oligomer. Thus UGT2B1/EGT acts as a dominant negative mutant. In contrast, EGT/UGT2B1 did not affect UGT2B1 activity, suggesting that it does not interact with UGT2B1. We have previously proposed that UGT2B1 may form homodimers (rather than higher oligomers) as the stable high molecular weight band associated with UGT2B1 expression is approximately twice the molecular weight of the monomeric protein. If a Mendelian ratio of homodimers and heterodimers were formed between co-expressed UGT2B1 and UGT2B1/EGT (i.e. 257 UGT2B1:UGT2B1 homodimer, 507 UGT2B1/EGT:UGT2B1 heterodimer, 257 UGT2B1/EGT:UGT2B1/EGT homodimer), then half of the total pool of UGT2B1 would be involved in formation of the inactive heterodimers. Thus we would predict that the level of relative UGT2B1 activity would be halved. The observed reduction in activity was only 347; however, this may be explained by the differential expression of UGT2B1 and UGT2B1/EGT. The ratio of expression of wild-type to chimeric protein was approximately 4:3, and when this factor is incorporated into our calculation, the expected reduction in activity is approximately 387, which is in good agreement with the observed value. Thus the co-expression study supports the dimer model for UGT2B1. For some time it has been believed that UGT may act as an oligomer; however, little firm evidence has been published in support of this view. In this paper, we examined a stable high molecular mass complex that was associated with expression of UGT2B1 and devised functional assays to investigate the likely relationship between the high molecular mass complex and oligomerization. The complex of 110 kDa was always observed in microsomes of COS cells containing catalytically active UGT2B1 but was only sometimes observed in transfected COS cell microsomes devoid of activity. Furthermore, the functional compensation of two different, inactivating mutations in UGT2B1 by co-expression provides the strongest evidence to date that the active form of UGT is a homo-oligomer. This interaction was further defined by co-expression analysis of UGT2B1 and a chimeric protein that acted as a dominant negative mutant. This study demonstrated that UGT2B1 acts as a homodimer and also allowed the dimerization domain to be localized to the amino-terminal, variable half of the protein. The potential dimerization between two different UGT monomers within the aglycone recognition domain may allow formation of new substrate recognition sites, within such a heterodimer, that do not exist in the homodimeric forms of the enzymes. Recently, possible heterodimers of UGT2B1 and UGT1 isoforms were revealed by chemical cross-linking studies on liver microsomal preparations (20Ikushiro S. Emi Y. Iyanagi T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7154-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although substrate specificity was not assessed, the complex formation between UGT2B1 and these other UGTs was associated with alterations in the kinetic parameters of the glucuronidation of testosterone, a substrate of UGT2B1 (21Mackenzie P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9744-9749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 110-kDa band that was associated with UGT2B1 expression is proposed to be a stable dimer of UGT2B1 monomers. The formation of this 110-kDa complex was inhibited by truncation of the immediate amino terminus, which also correlated with loss of enzymatic activity. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that a conserved hydrophobic motif near the amino terminus is critical for activity. However, the precise role of this conserved region is unknown. A high molecular weight band was also observed in a chimeric construct that contained the amino-terminal half of UGT2B1. Thus there is a correlation between dimerization competence of the chimeric constructs (determined by the functional assay) and the formation of the high molecular weight band. This strongly suggests that this band represents the UGT2B1 homodimer, which is probably formed by a chaperone-mediated process in the ER membrane soon after synthesis of each monomer. It is likely that all UGT monomers form catalytically active dimers. The unusual stability of the UGT2B1 dimer that allows it to be observed in Western blots may be related to the substrates that it glucuronidates. UGT2B1 is very active toward carboxylic acid compounds (22Pritchard M. Fournel-Gigleux S. Siest G. Mackenzie P. Magdalou J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 42-50PubMed Google Scholar), forming acyl-glucuronides that are highly reactive (23Smith P.C. Benet L.Z. McDonagh A.F. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1990; 18: 639-644PubMed Google Scholar, 24Williams A.M. Worrel S. De Jersey J. Dickinson R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 745-755Google Scholar) and that may aid in cross-linking the subunits in the dimer. It is worthy of note that similar high molecular weight bands have been observed in rat liver microsomes that have been probed with anti-UGT antibody (not shown). Thus the cross-linking of UGT2B1 dimers in vivo may occur naturally to a small degree but is possibly emphasized by heterologous overexpression. In conclusion, our results provide compelling evidence that UGT2B1 monomers form catalytically active dimers via their amino termini."
https://openalex.org/W2015098759,"Abstract Prostaglandin F2α(PGF2α) is a product of cyclooxygenase-catalyzed metabolism of arachidonic acid. Recently, PGF2α analogs have been hypothesized to reduce intraocular pressure via relaxation of the ciliary muscle. To investigate the molecular basis of PGF2α receptor (FP) activation in the eye, we cloned the FP from a human ciliary body (hcb) cDNA library. The open reading frame of the hcb-FP cDNA was identical to the uterine FP cDNA. The hcb-FP appeared to be predominantly membrane-localized, as visualized by an FP-specific peptide antibody, and coupled to inositol phosphate formation when stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. Interestingly, the hcb-FP could also be activated by the F2isoprostane, 12-iso-PGF2α, in addition to its cognate ligand, PGF2α. 12-iso-PGF2α was less potent (EC50 = 5 μm) than PGF2α(EC50 = 10 nm) in generating inositol phosphates via the hcb-FP in HEK 293 cells. Both ligands also stimulated mitogenesis in NIH 3T3 cells. Although 12-iso-PGF2α caused a dose-dependent activation of the FP, it failed to activate the recombinant human prostacyclin receptor and caused only minimal activation of the thromboxane receptor isoforms stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. Four additional F2 isoprostanes, 8-iso-PGF2α, IPF2α-I, IPF2α-III, and 9β,11β-PGF2, caused trivial, or no, activation of the FP. Consistent with these observations, only PGF2α and 12-iso-PGF2α caused rapid homologous desensitization of FP and also exhibited cross-desensitization, with PGF2α resulting in a maximum of ∼60% desensitization. The human FP may thus be activated specifically, by the free radical-catalyzed F2 isoprostane, 12-iso-PGF2α, in addition to the cyclooxygenase product, PGF2α. Incidental receptor activation by isoprostanes may complement the actions of PGF2α in clinical syndromes where oxidant stress and augmented prostaglandin biosynthesis coincide."
https://openalex.org/W2083248929,"Although the C terminus of troponin I is known to be important in myofilament Ca2+ regulation in skeletal muscle, the regulatory function of this region of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) has not been defined. To address this question, the following recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified: mouse wild-type cTnI (WT cTnI; 211 residues), cTnI-(1–199) (missing 12 residues), cTnI-(1–188) (missing 23 residues), and cTnI-(1–151) (missing 60 residues). The inhibitory activity of cTnI and the mutants was tested in myofibrils, from which cTnI·cTnC was extracted by exchanging endogenous cardiac troponin with exogenous cTnT causing the Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofibrils to be lost. Addition of increasing amounts of exogenous WT cTnI or cTnI-(1–199) to cTnT-treated myofibrils at pCa 8 caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the maximum ATPase activity. However, cTnI-(1–188) and cTnI-(1–151) inhibited this activity to about 757 and 507 of that of the WT cTnI, respectively. We also formed a complex of either WT cTnI or each of the mutants with cTnC, reconstituted the complex into the cTnT-treated myofibrils, and measured the Mg2+-ATPase activity as a function of pCa. We found that the cTnI-(1–188)·cTnC complex only partially restored Ca2+ sensitivity, whereas the cTnI-(1–151)·cTnC complex did not restore any Ca2+sensitivity. Each cTnI C-terminal deletion mutant was able to bind to cTnC, as shown by urea-polyacrylamide gel-shift analysis and size exclusion chromatography. Each mutant also co-sedimented with actin. Our results indicate that residues 152–199 (C-terminal to the inhibitory region) of cTnI are essential for full inhibitory activity and Ca2+ sensitivity of myofibrillar ATPase activity in the heart.

The transition of heart muscle from diastole to systole involves a Ca2+-dependent process in which an inhibitory protein, cTnI, 1The abbreviations used are: TnI, troponin I; c, cardiac; TnC, troponin C; TnT, troponin T; Tm, tropomyosin; fs, fast skeletal; WT, wild-type; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: TnI, troponin I; c, cardiac; TnC, troponin C; TnT, troponin T; Tm, tropomyosin; fs, fast skeletal; WT, wild-type; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. plays a key role in switching on the reaction of myosin cross-bridges with actin. A current model for the switching mechanism has been derived largely from studies with fast skeletal TnI and is as follows. During diastole, cTnI interacts tightly with actin and contributes to the inhibition of the actin-cross-bridge reaction. During systole, with Ca2+binding to cTnC, there is an increased affinity of cTnI for cTnC, which results in weakening of cTnI binding to actin. This leads to changes in Tm position, resulting in activation of contraction through promotion of the transition of cross-bridges from blocked or weak binding states to strong force-generating states (1Solaro R.J. Sperelakis N. Physiology and Pathophysiology of the Heart. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1995: 355-366Google Scholar). In the case of heart muscle, Ca2+ signaling appears different from that of fast skeletal muscle, and little is known about regions of cTnI that are essential for the Ca2+ switch. An anti-parallel interaction between cTnI and cTnC has been demonstrated (2Krudy G. Kleerekoper Q. Guo X. Howarth J.W. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23731-23735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the anti-parallel arrangement, an interaction of the N-terminal region of cTnI with cTnC acts as an anchor maintaining the two proteins in the correct spatial orientation. The C-terminal region of cTnI is thought to bind to the N terminus of cTnC, which contains the low affinity Ca2+-specific site (site II) (2Krudy G. Kleerekoper Q. Guo X. Howarth J.W. Solaro R.J.

Interestingly, it has been shown recently by heteronuclear, multidimensional NMR spectroscopy that upon transition from the apo- to the Ca2+-saturated states of the N-domain of cTnC, fewer hydrophobic residues are exposed in cTnC than in fsTnC (7Sia S.K.

The finding that the structure of the regulatory N-domain of cTnC is significantly more compact relative to fsTnC (7Sia S.K. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagne S.M. Liu W. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14881-14884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it is known that TnI contains an inhibitory region (residues 139–150 in mouse cTnI) that binds to both TnC and actin, but not to both simultaneously (11Nozaki S. Kobayashi K. Katayama E. Muramatsu I. Chem. Lett. 1980; 3: 345-348Crossref Google Scholar, 12Talbot J.A. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2798-2802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region is believed to be largely responsible for the ability of TnI to inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity and constitutes a key part of the molecular switch turning on the thin filament. Although structural and modulatory functions have been identified within the unique cardiac-specific N-terminal region of cTnI, the functional role of its C-terminal region has yet to be delineated. Our laboratory is using recombinant DNA technology to investigate structure-function relations of cardiac TnI. The C terminus of cTnI is highly conserved among the TnI isoforms and its binding to the N terminus of cTnC containing the low affinity Ca2+-specific site indicates it may be important for Ca2+-dependent regulation of cardiac muscle contraction. Although it has been shown that the C terminus of fsTnI appears to be important for Ca2+ sensitivity in myofilaments in skeletal muscle (13Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.R.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11026-11035Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), there is no evidence for such a role in cardiac muscle. In this study, we generated three deletion mutants of cardiac TnI to examine the function of the C-terminal domain of cTnI in the cardiac myofilament. Our results indicate that regions of cTnI C-terminal to the inhibitory region are essential for full inhibitory activity and Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments.

The cTnI and mutant cTnI DNAs were excised from the cloning vector using NcoI and BamHI and isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. After purification from gels, the fragment was ligated into the NcoI/BamHI site of the pET-3d expression vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). This DNA was used to transform BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen, Inc.) before expression of WT cTnI or the deletion mutants of cTnI. A single transformant or frozen stock of transformed cells was used to seed 1 liter of LB medium containing 50 ॖg/ml of carbenicillin. The culture was grown overnight at 37 °C. The cells were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fraction removed. The cells were stored overnight at −80 °C. The pellets were resuspended in ice-cold 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 6m urea, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 ml/liter of cell culture) and sonicated on ice for approximately 20 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and loaded onto a CM-Sepharose column equilibrated with Buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 6 m urea, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT). The WT cTnI and mutant cTnIs were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in the presence of Buffer B. The WT cTnI and mutant cTnIs were further purified by affinity chromatography on an Affi-Gel-15 (Bio-Rad) cTnC column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 murea, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT. The WT cTnI and mutant cTnIs were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m urea, 2 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT. The preparations of WT cTnI and the mutant cTnIs were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (157) (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular weights of WT cTnI, cTnI-(1–199), cTnI-(1–188), and cTnI-(1–151) were 24,260, 22,925, 21,656, and 17,407, respectively. The contruction of a pET-3d plasmid construct containing the complete coding sequence for human cTnC and the expression and purification of the cTnC was performed as described by Pan and Johnson (20Pan B.-S. Johnson Jr., R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 817-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Purity of the cTnC was examined by SDS-PAGE (157). Hearts were immediately excised from ether-anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (225–250 g) and washed in saline. The atria were trimmed and myofibrils were prepared from the ventricles as described previously (21Pagani E.D. Solaro R.J. Schwartz A. Methods in Pharmacology. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1984: 49-61Google Scholar). Purified myofibrils were resuspended in Buffer A and total protein concentration was determined (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myofibrillar proteins were visualized on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (12.57). The cTnI·cTnC complexes containing WT cTnI, cTnI-(1–199), cTnI-(1–188), or cTnI-(1–151) were formed as described by Johnson et al.(23Johnson J.D. Collins J.H. Robertson S.P. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9635-9640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Purified cTnI and cTnC (1:1 molar ratio) were mixed to give a final concentration of 8 mg/ml in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 6 m urea, 1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT and incubated on ice for 1 h. The mixture was sequentially dialyzed according to Potter (15Potter J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), by first removing the urea and then reducing KCl from 1.0 m to 0.75m, 0.5 m, and to 0.3 m. The cTnI·cTnC complex was finally dialyzed against Buffer C (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 ॖg/ml pepstatin A). After dialysis, the cTnI·cTnC complex was centrifuged (10,000 × g; 10 min) and an aliquot was visualized on 6 m urea-polyacrylamide gels to confirm complex formation (24Ornstein L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (3318) Google Scholar). WT cTnI or cTnI mutants and cTnC were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio in sample buffer containing 6 m urea, 107 glycerol, 27 ॆ-mercaptoethanol, 0.027 bromphenol blue with either 10 mm EGTA or 10 mm CaCl2. Aliquots (20 ॖl) were analyzed on 87 polyacrylamide gels, pH 8.6, containing 6 m urea essentially as described by Ornstein (24Ornstein L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (3318) Google Scholar). Complexes containing cTnC with WT cTnI, cTnI-(1–199), cTnI-(1–188), or cTnI-(1–151) were prepared at a 1:1 molar ratio by sequential dialysis as described above. The cTnI·cTnC complexes (20 ॖm) in 100 ॖl of 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT were injected onto a Superdex-75 HR 10/30 HPLC gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) that was equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted from the column with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and detected by monitoring at A 280. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (157). This method removes endogenous cardiac troponin from the myofibrils by treatment with excess exogenous cTnT. The treated myofibrils contain the exogenous cTnT, but removal of cTnI and cTnC makes the myofibrils insensitive to Ca2+. The procedure was originally suggested by Hatakenaka and Ohtsuki (25Hatakenaka M. Ohtsuki I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and was performed as described by Rarick et al. (26Rarick H.M. Opgenorth T.O. von Geldern T.W. Wa-Wong J.R. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27039-27043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Purified bovine cTnT was dissolved in Buffer D (20 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 ॖg/ml pepstatin A). The cTnT, at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml, was added to centrifuged rat myofibrils (4 mg) in a 1:10 weight ratio of cTnT:myofibrils. The volume was adjusted to 2.5 ml with Buffer D, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 60 min with gentle mixing every 2 min. The cTnT-treated myofibrils were centrifuged (2,000 × g; 10 min), and the pellet was resuspended in 2.5 ml of Buffer C containing 2 mg of WT cTnI, 2 mg of cTnI mutants, or 4 mg cTnI·cTnC complex. This mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 75 min with gentle mixing at 2-min intervals. The reconstituted myofibrils were centrifuged (2,000 ×g; 10 min) and the pellets resuspended in 2 ml of Buffer A, recentrifuged, and suspended in a final volume of 1 ml of Buffer A. The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was determined by measuring inorganic phosphate release using a modification of the methods of White (27White H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and Dobrowolski et al. (28Dobrowolski Z. Xu G.-Q. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5703-5710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in 96-well microtiter plates at 30 °C in an incubator. The assay conditions varied and are described in the figure legends. The total volume was 70 ॖl, and reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 mm ATP. Reactions were stopped after 10 min by the addition of 25 ॖl of 13.47 SDS, 0.12 m EDTA. Phosphate liberation was linear over the time course of the experiment. The amount of inorganic phosphate released was determined colorimetrically by the addition of 200 ॖl of 0.57 FeSO4, 0.57 ammonium molybdate in 0.5 mH2SO4. After 20 min, the absorbance was measured at 650 nm with a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). The total concentrations of buffers, salts, and ATP needed to give the desired concentrations of free Mg2+, free Ca2+, KCl, EGTA, MgATP2− and ionic strength at pH 7.0 in the reaction mixtures were computed using constants summarized in Fabiato and Fabiato (29Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). F-actin (1 nmol), Tm (0.286 nmol), and cTnI or cTnI mutants (0.286 nmol) were mixed (7:2:2 molar ratio of actin:Tm:cTnI) in 180 ॖl of 2 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and centrifuged for 30 min at 150,000 × g in a Beckman Airfuge. After centrifugation, the supernatant fraction was removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 6 m urea. Both pellets and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.57). Repeated measurements were at leastn = 3, and are presented as mean ± S.E. Measured relationships between pCa and ATPase activity were fit to the Hill equation using nonlinear least-squares regression to derive the pCa50 and Hill coefficient (n) (Inplot curve fitting software, GraphPAD Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Statistical differences of pCa50 values were analyzed by a paired Student's t test with significance set at p < 0.05. To localize protein domains in the C terminus of cTnI that are important for Ca2+ regulation of cardiac muscle contraction, we generated three deletion mutants of mouse cardiac cTnI, which were compared with the WT cTnI in functional assays. The amino acid sequence of the mouse WT cTnI consists of 211 residues and is shown in Fig. 1 (upper panel). The WT cTnI and the cTnI C-terminal deletion mutants are shown schematically in Fig. 1 (lower panel). The cTnI-(1–199), cTnI-(1–188), and cTnI-(1–151) mutants have 12, 23, and 60 residues deleted from the C terminus, respectively. The cTnI-(1–151) mutant terminates 1 amino acid residue past the inhibitory region of cTnI. The mouse WT cTnI and each cTnI C-terminal deletion mutant were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described under 舠Experimental Procedures舡 to >997 purity (Fig.2). The gel in Fig. 2 shows that the recombinant mouse WT cTnI (lane 3) migrated slightly slower than native cardiac TnI (lane 2) purified from bovine tissue, possibly because of the lack of acetylation of the N-terminal methionine. We examined the binding of each cTnI C-terminal deletion mutant to cTnC by visualization of cTnI·cTnC complex formation on urea polyacrylamide gels and size exclusion chromatography. As shown in Fig.3, WT cTnI and each C-terminal deletion mutant of cTnI formed a binary complex with cTnC on urea polyacrylamide gels in the presence of Ca2+, but not in the presence of EGTA. We could not detect any differences between WT cTnI and each cTnI mutant in their ability to bind to cTnC in the denaturing conditions used for the urea PAGE analysis. This suggests that the structural interaction between the N terminus of cTnI and the C terminus of cTnC is the major contributor to formation of the cTnI·cTnC complex. We also tested whether WT cTnI and each cTnI C-terminal deletion mutant formed a complex with cTnC under non-denaturing conditions by size exclusion chromatography. At physiological salt concentrations, after passage through a HPLC gel filtration column, WT cTnI and each cTnI C-terminal deletion mutant formed a stable binary complex with cTnC (data not shown). We also examined the ability of WT cTnI and the C-terminal deletion mutants of cTnI to bind to F-actin. F-actin, cTnI or cTnI deletion mutants, and Tm were combined, and the binding of cTnI or the cTnI deletion mutants to F-actin was assayed by centrifugation in an Airfuge. The supernatant fractions and pellets were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. WT cTnI and each cTnI C-terminal deletion mutant co-sedimented with F-actin or F-actin-Tm (data not shown). This was only a qualitative technique, but it indicated that there was binding to F-actin even after deletion of up to 60 residues from the C terminus of cTnI. The ability of the cTnI C-terminal deletion mutants to bind to F-actin-Tm suggested that they retained inhibitory activity. We directly tested their inhibitory capabilities by adding WT cTnI or the cTnI C-terminal deletion mutants to rat myofibrils lacking endogenous cTnI and cTnC. The cTnI·cTnC complex was extracted by modification (26Rarick H.M. Opgenorth T.O. von Geldern T.W. Wa-Wong J.R. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27039-27043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) of the method by Hatakenata and Ohtsuki (25Hatakenaka M. Ohtsuki I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which uses excess exogenous bovine cTnT to displace the troponin complex from the myofibrils. Fig. 4, which shows SDS-PAGE analysis of control and cTnT-extracted myofibrils, demonstrates a decrease in the levels of endogenous cTnI and cTnC, and the presence of bovine cTnT without obvious alteration of other myofilament protein levels (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). In Fig. 4, we also show profiles of cTnT-extracted myofibrils after reconstitution with WT cTnI or each cTnI C-terminal deletion mutant complexed with cTnC (lanes 3–6). It is difficult to visualize cTnC with Coomassie Blue staining, but in a previous publication (26Rarick H.M. Opgenorth T.O. von Geldern T.W. Wa-Wong J.R. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27039-27043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we have used alkaline urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to show the removal and restoration of cTnC under these conditions. We analyzed the effect of C-terminal deletion of cTnI on its ability to inhibit the Mg2+-ATPase activity of myofibrils lacking cTnI·cTnC. Fig. 5 shows the effect of increasing concentrations of the various forms of cTnI on the unregulated ATPase activity of the myofibrils. In the absence of added cTnI, as expected, the ATPase rate was independent of Ca2+and similar to that obtained in native myofibrils at maximal activity (pCa 4.9). WT cTnI reduced this activity to 257 of maximum with the inhibition reaching a plateau at 1.0 ॖm WT cTnI. The cTnI-(1–199) mutant had an inhibitory effect similar to WT cTnI. However, the inhibitory capacity of the cTnI-(1–188) mutant was reduced to 757 of that of WT cTnI and reached a plateau at a concentration of 1 ॖm. Inhibition by the cTnI-(1–151) mutant was about 507 of that of WT cTnI and attained a plateau at 2 ॖm. Even a concentration of 12 ॖm could not increase the inhibitory capacity of this mutant beyond 457 of that of WT cTnI (data not shown). Thus, loss of 23 residues at the C terminus of cTnI results in some loss of inhibitory activity that is further decreased after removal of an additional 37 residues. We next tested the ability of cTnC to reverse the inhibitory effect of both WT cTnI and the cTnI C-terminal deletion mutants. The molar ratios of cTnC to cTnI tested varied from 0.5 to 4, and measurements were made in the absence and presence of Ca2+. As Fig.6 illustrates, addition of cTnC at a 1:1 molar ratio to cTnI in the presence of Ca2+ reversed the inhibition caused by both WT cTnI and the cTnI-(1–199) mutant. The inhibition caused by cTnI-(1–188) was released by cTnC in the presence of Ca2+ with restoration to within 207 of that for WT cTnI. However, the inhibition of maximum ATPase activity caused by cTnI-(1–151) was not released by the addition of cTnC (in the presence of Ca2+) even at a molar ratio of 4:1 (cTnC:cTnI). We also formed a complex of WT cTnI or cTnI C-terminal deletion mutants with cTnC before reconstitution into cTnT-extracted myofibrils, and measured the Mg2+-ATPase activity as a function ofpCa. Fig. 7 shows that under these experimental conditions, the Ca2+ sensitivity was restored to that observed for control myofibrils with WT cTnI·cTnC and cTnI-(1–199)·cTnC. On the other hand, reconstitution with the cTnI-(1–188)·cTnC complex only partially restored Ca2+ sensitivity (data not shown), and we observed a significant leftward shift in the pCa50 (Fig.7). Data for the cTnI-(1–151)·cTnC complex is not shown in Fig. 7because after reconstitution with this complex, no Ca2+sensitivity was observed. These results indicate that in cardiac TnI, residues 152–188 (C-terminal to the inhibitory region) are essential for Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofibrils. Our results provide the first evidence that the C-terminal region of cardiac TnI, downstream from the inhibitory region, is essential for the Ca2+-dependent regulation of cardiac myofilament activation. The functional significance of the C-terminal domain of cTnI fits with evidence of an anti-parallel alignment between cTnI and cTnC in which the C-terminal region of cTnI binds to the N terminus of cTnC. This insight makes an important contribution to our objective to determine unique aspects of the detailed mechanism by which Ca2+ switches on cardiac myofilaments. Our findings suggest a need to rethink the relative contribution of the central inhibitory region of cTnI to the regulation of force. In previous studies, the primary focus has been the inhibitory region of cTnI. An 11-amino acid peptide corresponding to the sequence of the inhibitory region of cTnI has the capacity to inhibit ATPase activityin vitro (12Talbot J.A. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2798-2802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1726-1732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Van Eyk J.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 30: 9974-9981Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), although not to the same extent as full-length cTnI. Surprisingly, cardiac fiber bundles reconstituted with the cTnI inhibitory peptide are able to undergo sequential contraction-relaxation cycles (32Van Eyk J.E. Strauss J.D. Hodges R.S. Ruegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The importance of the inhibitory peptide in skeletal muscle is also supported by the inability of mutant fsTnI, missing the inhibitory region, to inhibit ATPase activityin vitro (33Zhang R. Sheng Z. Jones M. Parsons B. Potter J.D. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A165Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that in addition to the inhibitory region, two additional sites in cTnI, located C-terminal to the inhibitory region, are essential for the expression of maximum inhibition. From our analysis of the effect of C-terminal deletions on the ability of cTnI to inhibit ATPase activity (Fig. 5), we deduce that the inhibitory region inhibits only about 507 of the ATPase activity. Two additional sites, between residues 152–188 and residues 189–199, contribute approximately 257 each to the inhibition of ATPase activity, as shown by reconstitution with mutants cTnI-(1–188) and cTnI-(1–199), respectively (Fig. 5). One interpretation of these data is that there are two additional actin-Tm binding sites located in the C-terminal domain of cTnI. Farah et al. (13Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.R. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Tripletet al. (34Tripet B. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) also postulate the presence of an additional actin-Tm binding site located on the C-terminal side of the inhibitory region in fsTnI (residues 136–148). The second putative actin-Tm binding site in cTnI, comprising 10 amino acids (cTnI residues 189–199; fsTnI residues 157–167), does not appear to function in skeletal muscle. On the other hand, based on evidence that there is complete absence of inhibitory activity with removal of the inhibitory region (residues 104–120) in fsTnI (13Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.R. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Zhang R. Sheng Z. Jones M. Parsons B. Potter J.D. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A165Google Scholar), we also cannot exclude the possibility that binding of the inhibitory region to actin-Tm induces conformational changes in actin-Tm that expose sites, which can then bind to actin-Tm binding sites located in the C terminus of cTnI. In a model of control of thin filament activation, Lehrer (35Lehrer S.S. J. Musc. Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) suggested that cTnI may be involved in stabilizing a 舠blocked state舡 of the thin filament by sterically blocking the actin-myosin interaction, and that Ca2+ induces movement of cTnI away from actin. TnI would need to be in an elongated configuration and span at least several actin monomers to be involved in a blocking function. In a model of Ca2+-saturated fsTnI-fsTnC complex derived from small-angle x-ray scattering data, fsTnI adopts an extended conformation in the presence of fsTnC and Ca2+ that is about 115 Å long (36Olah G.A. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12800-12806Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). An actin monomer is estimated to be about 40 Å in diameter (37Kabsch W. Mannherz D. Suck D. Pai E.E. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar); thus, TnI may span 2–3 monomers of actin. Residues C-terminal to the inhibitory region may be critical for extension of TnI to stabilize a blocked state of the thin filament, especially in the case of cTnI, which has an additional 32 amino acids at the N terminus. In addition to the importance of residues C-terminal to the inhibitory region of cTnI in expression of maximal inhibition of ATPase activity, this C-terminal region of cTnI appears to be essential for Ca2+-dependent regulation of cardiac myofilament contraction. We observed that the the cTnI-(1–188) mutant had impaired ability to regulate Ca2+ sensitivity in myofibrils and the cTnI-(1–151) mutant had lost the ability to regulate Ca2+ sensitivity (Fig. 6). This loss of Ca2+-dependent control of the myofilament after deletion of portions of the C terminus of cTnI implies an alteration in the interaction of cTnI and cTnC, most likely through removal of a binding site for cTnC in the C-terminal region of cTnI. Evidence, derived largely from studies on fast skeletal myofilaments, indicates multiple sites of interaction between fsTnI and fsTnC (13Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.R.

Experiments have revealed that fsTnC may bind C-terminal to the inhibitory region of fsTnI. A fsTnI peptide, fsTnI96–148, which extends about 30 residues C-terminal to the inhibitory region (96–114), had tighter binding to fsTnC than the inhibitory peptide, fsTnI96–114 (40Pearlstone J.R. Sykes B.D. Smilie L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7601-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Kobayashi et al. (41Kobayashi T. Tao T. Gergely J. Collins J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5725-5729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that residues 132–141 of fsTnI (corresponding to cTnI166–174) cross-linked to Cys-12 in the N terminus of fsTnC. Moreover, an N-terminal part of fsTnC (sTnC46–78) not only cross-linked to the inhibitory region, fsTnI96–114, but to residues 122–152 of fsTnI (cTnI156–186). It has also been demonstrated that in the presence of Ca2+, Cys-133 of fsTnI (cTnI167) moves 0.7 nm toward Cys-98 in the central helix of fsTnC (42Wang C. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 190: 509-521Google Scholar, 43Tao T. Gowell E. Strasburg G.M. Gergely J. Leavis P.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5902-5908Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and 1.5 nm away from actin (44Tao T. Gong B.-J. Leavis P.C. Science. 1990; 247: 1339-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This latter finding underscores the importance of the C-terminal part of TnI in the Ca2+-switch mechanism. In our experiments, evidence for a cTnC binding site C-terminal to the inhibitory region comes from the finding that cTnC was not able to overcome the inhibition of maximal ATPase activity by the cTnI-(1–151) mutant in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig.6). The loss of inhibitory function after deletion of either 23 (cTnI-(1–188)) or 60 (cTnI-(1–151)) residues (Fig. 5) suggests a weakened interaction of cTnI with actin-Tm, which would promote the availability of actin-Tm for reaction with myosin. A weakened cTnI-actin-Tm interaction could also explain the apparent increase in Ca2+ sensitivity seen with the cTnI-(1–188) mutant (Fig.7). The evidence for a proposed single cTnC binding domain downstream from the inhibitory region is based on the data presented in Fig. 6. Although inhibition of Mg2+-ATPase activity was reduced in myofibrils reconstituted with the cTnI-(1–188) mutant, addition of cTnC and Ca2+ almost completely restored the Mg2+-ATPase activity. However, addition of cTnC and Ca2+ to myofibrils reconstituted with the cTnI-(1–151) mutant could not reverse the inhibition of the Mg2+-ATPase activity (Fig. 6). These results indicate the presence of a Ca2+-dependent cTnC binding domain within residues 152–188. Thus, this region contains both actin-Tm and cTnC binding domains. The existence of these additional actin-Tm and cTnC binding sites C-terminal to the inhibitory region add to the complexity of thin filament protein interactions and may also be an important component of the Ca2+ regulation of thin filament activation. Although our study has focused on the role of the C-terminal domain of cTnI in Ca2+ regulation of cardiac myofilaments, it is also important to emphasize that cTnI contains an unique N-terminal extension that undergoes covalent modification by protein kinase A, which decreases the pCa50 for activation of the myofilaments. The mechanism involves phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser 23,24 and an increase in the rate of dissociation of Ca2+from the N terminus of cTnC (45Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Holroyde M.J. Kranias E.G. Potter J.D. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 260-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect appears to involve global changes in the cTnI molecule that signal an altered interaction between the C-terminal domain of cTnI with cTnC and/or actin-Tm. Dong et al. (46Dong W.-J. Chandra M. Xing J. She M. Solaro R.J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6754-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have demonstrated this global change by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer to determine a decrease in mean distance between N- and C-terminal regions of cTnI induced by protein kinase A phosphorylation. Moreover, Chandra et al. (47Chandra M. Dong W.-J. Pan B.-S. Cheung H.C. Solaro R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar) have demonstrated that phosphorylation of the N terminus of cTnI by protein kinase A is able to depress Ca2+ binding to an N-terminal fragment of cTnC (cTnC-(1–89). Thus, covalent modifications at the N terminus of cTnI are sensed by the C terminus of cTnI, which appears able to modulate the interaction of the N-terminal domain of cTnC with Ca2+. In conclusion, our results contribute new information to the detailed understanding of the mechanism by which cTnI participates in the Ca2+ switch of the heart, and are important in the context of both cardiac physiology and patho-physiology. There is now evidence that mutations in the C-terminal region of the cTnI molecule are causal in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the Japanese population (48Kimura A. Harada H. Park J.E. Nishi H. Satoh M. Takahashi M. Hiroi S. Sasaoka T. Ohbuchi N. Nakamura T. Koyanagi T. Hwang T.H. Choo J.A. Chung K.S. Hasagawa A. Nagai R. Okazaki O. Nakamura H. Matsuzasi M. Sakamoto T. Toshima H. Koga Y. Imaizumi T. Sasazuki T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that such mutations in cTnI could have severe effects on the control of cardiac myofilaments by Ca2+. Moreover, the region of cTnI missing in the cTnI-(1–151) mutant, which interacts with the N terminus of cTnC, could be important with regard to rational design of pharmacological agents useful in heart failure. We thank Tobias Herzig for help in the construction of the cTnI C-terminal deletion mutant, cTnI-(1–151), and Dr. Jennifer Van Eyk for assistance with the actin co-sedimentation assay."

This 145-kDa protein is induced to associate with Shc by multiple cytokines and may play an important role in the negative regulation of immunocompetent cells mediated by FcγRIIB receptor. We report here that SHIP is present in human blood platelets and may be involved in platelet activation evoked by thrombin. Platelet SHIP was identified by Western blotting as a single 145-kDa protein. Both phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate 5-phosphatase activities could be demonstrated in anti-SHIP immunoprecipitates of platelet lysate. Thrombin stimulation induced a tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP, this effect being prevented if platelets were not shaken or if RGD-containing peptides were present, indicating an aggregation-dependent, integrin-mediated event. Moreover, although the intrinsic phosphatase activity of SHIP did not appear to be significantly increased, tyrosine-phosphorylated SHIP was relocated to the actin cytoskeleton upon activation in an aggregation- and integrin engagement-dependent manner. Finally, the striking correlation observed between phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate production and the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP, as well as its relocation to the cytoskeleton upon thrombin stimulation, suggest a role for SHIP in the aggregation-dependent and GpIIb-IIIa-mediated accumulation of this important phosphoinositide.

In vitro, this lipid kinase activity is able to specifically phosphorylate the D3-position of the inositol ring of various phosphoinositides, thus producing phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate (PtdIns(3)P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3). However, except for h-Vps34, the activity of which is restricted to PtdIns (3Volinia S. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. MacDougall L.K. Stein R. Zvelebil M.J. Domin J. Panaretou C.

Recently, a direct regulation of the Akt proto-oncogene product by PtdIns(3,4)P2 has been reported, suggesting a possible second messenger function for this lipid (12Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). In platelets, the production of these D3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides upon stimulation has been well documented (5Rittenhouse S.E.

Mass determination has revealed that up to 180 pmol/109 platelets of the latter is produced upon stimulation with the thromboxane receptor agonist U46619, representing 9.37 of the total phosphatidylinositol bisphosphates (16Gaudette D.C.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms involved in the regulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 production. One obligatory step in its biosynthesis is the phosphorylation at the D3-position of the inositol ring. The activation of the two forms of PI 3-kinases (p85α/p110 and p110γ) found in platelets has been studied by different groups (reviewed in Ref. 5Rittenhouse S.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 4401-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of p85α/p110 (PI 3-kinase α) has been shown to involve the small G-protein RhoA (19Zhang J. King W.G. Dillon S. Hall A. Feig L.

Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been proposed that PI 3-kinase α is the PI 3-kinase mainly involved in the sustained activation of GpIIb-IIIa in stimulated platelets (20Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6265-6272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The p110γ-related form of PI 3-kinase seems to be activated via the ॆγ complex of dissociated heterotrimeric G-proteins (20Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol.

Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22086-22089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a PI 3-kinase phosphorylating PtdIns(4)P may play a role in the formation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 in platelets, it has been suggested that the main part of PtdIns(3,4)P2 is formed by 5-dephosphorylation of newly generated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (23Carter A.N. Huang R. Sorisky A. Downes C.P. Rittenhouse S.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to PI 3-kinase activation, a key regulatory step would appear to be the involvement of a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase (24Drayer A.L. Pesesse X. De Smedt F. Communi D. Moreau C. Erneux C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). So far, two distinct 5-phosphatases that hydrolyze PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 have been described in platelets: a 75-kDa 5-phosphatase (25Mitchell C.A. Connolly T.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

Matzaris M. Brown S. Mitchell C.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4490-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The 75-kDa enzyme has a broad substrate specificity in vitro, as it is also a PtdIns(4,5)P2, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 5-phosphatase (25Mitchell C.A. Connolly T.M. Majerus P.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3397-3402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the PI 3-kinase α-associated 5-phosphatase seems to be specific for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (26Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Matzaris M. Brown S. Mitchell C.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4490-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although the preferential in vivo substrates for these 5-phosphatases and their regulation are still poorly known, they are potentially important elements in the control of intracellular level of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2. The recently cloned SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP) (28Drayer L.A. Pesesse X. De Smedt F. Woscholski R. Parker P. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These observations prompted us to investigate whether SHIP could also be present in human blood platelets and could be involved during platelet activation by thrombin. Indeed, thrombin-stimulated platelets provide an interesting model to study the different pathways leading to PtdIns(3,4)P2 accumulation, since the production of this phosphoinositide is high and sustained, and has been shown to be mainly, but not exclusively, aggregation-dependent and integrin-mediated (5Rittenhouse S.E.

The mouse anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody was purchased from Euromedex (Strasbourg, France). The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting reagents were obtained from Amersham International. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. A construct for expressing the complete coding sequence of human SHIP was prepared using a C-terminally truncated construct, which was cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) as described previously (28Drayer L.A.

Using the unique internal EcoRI site in the SHIP sequence and the EcoRV site in the vector, nucleotides 300–2963 of C-terminal truncated SHIP were replaced by nucleotides 300–4150 of human placenta cDNA SHIP. COS-7 cells were grown and transfected as described previously (37De Smedt F. Boom A. Pesesse X. Schiffmann S.N. Erneux C. J. Biol.

Platelets were used at 3 × 109 cells/ml and stimulated for different periods of time with 1 IU/ml thrombin at 37 °C and under gentle shaking (150 strokes/min).

Washed platelets (1.5 × 109 platelets in 0.5 ml) resuspended in buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 4 ॖg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) were disrupted by sonication at 4 °C (40 kHz for 3 × 5 s) using an ultrasonic cell disrupter (Branson Sonifier 250). Cytosolic and membrane fractions were separated by centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The particulate pellet was resuspended in buffer A. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay system using bovine serum albumin as standard. Proteins from the different fractions were resuspended in the electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, separated by 7.57 SDS/PAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Gelman Sciences) as reported previously (15Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The blots were blocked with 17 milk powder, 17 bovine serum albumin in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.17 Tween 20. Immunodetections were performed with the relevant antibodies, and the reactions were visualized using peroxydase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL chemiluminescence system. The quantification of the different bands was performed by a densitometric analysis, which determines the pixel volume in each area (Gel Doc 1000, Bio-Rad). Reactions (1.5 × 109cells in 0.5 ml) were stopped by addition of one volume of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 27 Triton X-100, 200 mm NaF, 80 mmNa4P2O7, 4 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm PMSF, and 10 ॖg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. After gentle shaking during 20 min at 4 °C and centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), the soluble fraction was collected and precleared for 30 min at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose CL4B. The precleared suspensions were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the adequate antibodies, and the immune complexes were precipitated by addition of 50 ॖl of 107 (w/v) protein A-Sepharose CL4B for 1 h. After centrifugation (6000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), the immunoprecipitates were washed once in lysis buffer diluted in one volume of distilled water, then washed with a buffer (containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0,57 Triton X-100, 100 ॖm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 ॖg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin), and finally washed twice with the same buffer without Triton X-100 and Na3VO4. Immunoprecipitates were then used for electrophoresis. For enzyme assays, one half of the immunoprecipitate was used. PtdIns(3,4,5)-[32P]P3 was prepared using PtdIns(4,5)P2, [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products, France), and immunopurified PI 3-kinase as described previously (9Payrastre B. Gironcel D. Plantavid M. Mauco G. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The 5-phosphatase activity was measured essentially as described elsewhere (30Osborne M.A. Zenner G. Lubinus M. Zhang X. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Majerus P. Burn P. Kochan J.P. J. Biol.

Reaction mixtures (25 ॖl) containing immunoprecipitated SHIP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and substrate were mixed for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of chloroform/methanol (v/v) and the lipids extracted following a Bligh and Dyer modified procedure (41Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 37: 911-917Crossref Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and its degradation product PtdIns(3,4)P2 were separated by TLC as described previously (42Matsuo T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Katada T. Ui M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the radioactive spots were visualized by a PhosphorImager 445 SI (Molecular Dynamics, Inc) or autoradiography. Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 5-phosphatase assays were done with [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (1 ॖm) as described previously (28Drayer L.A. Pesesse X. De Smedt F. Woscholski R. Parker P. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The production of PtdIns(3,4)P2 was analyzed in platelets labeled with32Pi (Amersham International) as described previously (14Sultan C. Plantavid M. Bachelot C. Grondin P. Breton M. Mauco G.

Briefly, reactions were stopped by addition of chloroform/methanol (v/v), and the lipids were extracted following a Bligh and Dyer modified procedure (41Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem.

To determine whether the SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase SHIP was expressed in human platelets, a specific antibody raised against a C-terminal peptide sequence of mouse SHIP was used. No signal could be detected in COS cells transfected with the vector alone (Fig.1 A, lane 1), whereas a single 145-kDa protein was detected in SHIP-transfected cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). As shown in Fig. 1 A(lane 4), an identical single 145-kDa protein was detected in human blood platelet lysate, whereas a normal rabbit serum (NRS) gave no signal (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). This antibody, but not the NRS, could also immunoprecipitate a 145-kDa protein from a platelet lysate that was recognized by the antiserum (Fig.1 A, lanes 6 and 7). This 145-kDa protein was mainly found in the soluble fraction of platelet lysates (Fig. 1 A, lanes 8 and 9). To further establish that the platelet 145-kDa protein recognized by the antiserum was indeed an inositol and phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, phosphatase activities were determined in anti-SHIP immunoprecipitates. As clearly shown in Fig. 1 (B andC), the 145-kDa immunoprecipitated protein exhibited both PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P45-phosphatase activities, respectively. Altogether, these data indicated that the 145-kDa SHIP was present in human blood platelets. To see whether SHIP could be involved in thrombin-induced platelet activation, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from resting or activated platelets were probed with the anti-SHIP antibody. As shown in Fig.2 A, SHIP was weakly present in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates obtained from resting platelets or platelets stimulated with thrombin for a short period of time (30 s), whereas SHIP was clearly detected after longer stimulation (3 and 5 min). The specificity of the immunoprecipitation reaction was assessed by using protein A-Sepharose alone as a control, which did not precipitate SHIP. These data suggest that SHIP was mainly recruited to multienzymatic complexes, which are recovered in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates, during later steps of platelet activation. In agreement with this, we found that this event was inhibited if platelets were not shaken or if the binding of fibrinogen to the integrin GpIIb-IIIa was prevented by addition of RGDS peptide (Fig.2 A), indicating an aggregation- and integrin-dependent mechanism. To determine the tyrosine phosphorylation state of SHIP during thrombin activation, anti-SHIP immunoprecipitates were prepared and probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 B, SHIP was weakly tyrosine-phosphorylated in resting conditions or after 30 s of stimulation, whereas its tyrosine phosphorylation was clearly increased upon 3 and 5 min of stimulation. Again, this effect was blocked if platelets were not shaken or if RGDS peptide was present (Fig. 2 B, right panel). As a control, antibodies were stripped off the same nitrocellulose, and this was reprobed with the anti-SHIP antibody to check the amount of immunoprecipitated proteins which was similar over the different conditions (data not shown). To check whether SHIP 5-phosphatase activity was increased under these conditions, we determined the enzymatic activity in anti-SHIP immunoprecipitates obtained from resting or activated platelets. In vitro assays indicated that the activity of SHIP was not significantly increased upon stimulation, when either PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig.3 A) or Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (Fig. 3 B) was used as substrate. We then addressed the question of a possible thrombin stimulation-dependent relocation of SHIP as a potential regulatory event. We and others have shown previously that stimulation of platelets by thrombin resulted in the redis"
https://openalex.org/W2006075724,"The molybdenum cofactor is an essential part of all eukaryotic molybdoenzymes. It is a molybdopterin (MPT) revealing the same core structure in all organisms. The plant protein Cnx1 fromArabidopsis thaliana is involved in the multi-step biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactor. Previous studies (Stallmeyer, B., Nerlich, A., Schiemann, J., Brinkmann, H., and Mendel, R. R. (1995) Plant J. 8, 751–762) suggested a function of Cnx1 in a late step of cofactor biosynthesis distal to the formation of MPT,i.e. conversion of MPT into molybdenum cofactor. Here we present the first biochemical evidences confirming this assumption. The protein Cnx1 consists of two domains (E and G) homologous to two distinct Escherichia coli proteins involved in cofactor synthesis. Binding studies with recombinantly expressed and purified Cnx1 and with its single domains revealed a high affinity of the G domain to MPT (k D = 0.1 ॖm) with equimolar binding. In contrast, the E domain of Cnx1 binds MPT with lower affinity (k D = 1.6 ॖm) and in a cooperative manner (n H = 1.5). The entire Cnx1 showed a tight and cooperative MPT binding. Based on these data providing a common link between both domains that matches the previous characterization of plant and bacterial Cnx1 homologous mutants, we present a model for the function of Cnx1.

The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) 1The abbreviations used are: Moco, molybdenum cofactor; MPT, molybdopterin; Mo, molybdenum; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. is an integral constituent of all molybdoenzymes (with the exception of nitrogenase) where it forms part of the catalytically active center (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). It consists of molybdopterin (MPT), a unique 6-alkylpterin complexing one Mo atom via a dithiolene group to its four-carbon side chain, and reveals the same core structure in eukaryotes, eubacteria, and archaebacteria (2Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because molybdoenzymes are essential for such diverse metabolic processes like nitrate assimilation in autotrophs, sulfur detoxification in mammals, and phytohormone synthesis in plants, the survival of the organisms depends on their ability to synthesize Moco. The biosynthesis of this unique cofactor is complex because it requires the multi-step synthesis of the MPT moiety and the subsequent incorporation of Mo into MPT. In all organisms studied so far at least six gene products are involved in the formation of active Moco; first models for the biosynthetic pathway of Moco in Escherichia coli (2Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and plants (3Mendel R.R. Planta. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) are proposed. The first plant gene (cnx1) involved in Moco biosynthesis has been isolated by functional complementation of the Moco-deficientE. coli mutant mogA (4Stallmeyer B. Nerlich A. Schiemann J. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The encoded protein Cnx1 consists of two domains where the N terminus (E domain) is homologous to E. coli MoeA and the C terminus (G domain) is homologous to E. coli MogA, both proteins being involved in Moco synthesis (see Fig. 1). In contrast to mogA, E. coli mutants in moeA cannot be complemented by the plant protein Cnx1 (4Stallmeyer B. Nerlich A. Schiemann J. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Further, Cnx1 shows homologies to two eukaryotic proteins: Cinnamon (Moco protein from Drosophila(5Kamdar K.P. Shelton M.E. Finnerty V. Genetics. 1994; 137: 791-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and Gephyrin (neuroprotein from mammals (6Kirsch J. Wolters I. Triller A. Betz H. Nature. 1993; 366: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar)). Both homologous proteins show an inverted order of the conserved domains. First insights into the putative function of Cnx1 came from the characterization of the E. coli Moco mutant mogA, which had a residual nitrate reductase activity of about 17 of wild type (7Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is able to synthesize MPT up to 157 of wild type level (8Joshi M.S. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4310-4312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growing the mogA mutant under high molybdate concentrations (1–10 mm), the nitrate reductase activity is partially restored to 10–137 of wild type level (7Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without changes in MPT levels (8Joshi M.S. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4310-4312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus showing that mogA mutants are still able to synthesize MPT. Their defect should therefore reside in the last step of Moco formation, i.e. in the insertion of Mo into MPT. In contrast to MogA, nearly nothing is known about theE. coli protein MoeA homologous to the Cnx1 E domain. Mutants in moeA have no residual molybdoenzyme activities (9Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are not Mo-repairable (7Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but showed 37 of wild type MPT (9Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates that MoeA might be also involved in a step distal to MPT synthesis. The observed lack of moeA complementation by Cnx1 (4Stallmeyer B. Nerlich A. Schiemann J. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) indicates a significant divergence in the function of MoeA between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which could go back to the final attachment of a nucleotide to the MPT moiety being only observed in prokaryotes (10Johnson J.L. Bastian N.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3190-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The cnx1 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana was mapped to the chl-6 locus (4Stallmeyer B. Nerlich A. Schiemann J. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mutants in this locus are Moco-deficient but can be partially repaired by growth on high concentrations of molybdate (11Braaksma F.J. Feenstra W.J. Mutat. Res. 1973; 19: 175-185Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, it was shown that mutants in the Mo-repairablecnxA-locus are principally able to synthesize MPT; however, they are unable to produce active Moco (12Mendel R.R. Alikulov Z.A. Lvov N.P. Müller A.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 18: 395-399Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus it was suggested that Cnx1 should be involved in the last step of Moco synthesis,i.e. the insertion of Mo into MPT and/or intracellular Mo processing (3Mendel R.R. Planta. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stallmeyer B. Nerlich A. Schiemann J. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Müller A.J. Mendel R.R. Wray J.L. Kinghorn J.R. Molecular and Genetic Aspects of Nitrate Assimilation. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 166-185Google Scholar). For the other two eukaryotic Cnx1 homologs, Cinnamon and Gephyrin, no suggestion for a specific function in Moco synthesis has been reported yet. Here we present the first biochemical evidences for the predicted function of Cnx1. We show a high affinity binding of MPT to the Cnx1 G domain and demonstrate that the Cnx1 E domain binds MPT as well, but with lower affinity and in a cooperative manner. The data suggest a functional link between both domains in eukaryotic organisms. All chemicals used were from highest quality available. Xanthine oxidase (EC 1.1.3.22) from buttermilk grade I (0.69 units/mg) was obtained from Sigma (Munich, Germany). Prepacked gel filtration nick columns were used as recommended by the supplier (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). For overexpression und purification of recombinant proteins the QIAexpress kit from QIAgen (Hilden, Germany) for metal ion chelating chromatography of His-tagged proteins was used. The His tag (six amino acids) was localized at the C-terminal end of the protein (pQE-60 vector) separated by two additional amino acids. Prior to protein expression, the recombinant plasmids were transformed into the expression strain M15[pREP4] provided by QIAgen. Cells carrying the expression constructs were grown under aerobic conditions in 250 ml of culture medium up to an A 600 of 0.7–2.0, followed by induction with 1 mmisopropyl-ॆ-thiogalactosidase. The expression culture was continued for 5–20 h at 20–37 °C and then harvested (5,000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C). Purification of the recombinantly expressed proteins was performed as recommended by the supplier under native conditions at 4 °C. Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5–12.57 polyacrylamide gels, and pure fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, concentrated in ultrafiltration cells using YM10 membranes (Amicon), sterile filtrated through 0.1-ॖm membranes and stored at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by UV absorption measurements using the calculated extinction coefficient (14Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar) of the analyzed polypetides (Cnx1, 37,380m−1 cm−1; Cnx1 G domain, 16,680m−1 cm−1; Cnx1 E domain, 21,700m−1 cm−1). For determination of the native molecular weight of the expressed proteins, fast protein liquid gel filtration chromatography was performed on a Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl at 0.4 ml/min flow rate. The molecular weight was calculated using a calibration curve of standard proteins (LMW/HMW-Kit; Pharmacia). Isoelectric focusing was performed with Phast-Gels (pH 3–9) on the PhastSystem as recommended by the supplier (Pharmacia). MPT binding experiments were performed with protein-free MPT isolated from xanthine oxidase. Active MPT (in the reduced form) was used for binding experiments. Protein-bound and unbound MPT was analyzed separately after conversion to its stable oxidized fluorescent product Form A. For preparation of 250–350 pmol MPT, 200 ॖl of xanthine oxidase were gel filtrated under anaerobic conditions against MPT buffer (100 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.2, 5 mm sodium molybdate, 5 mmreduced glutathione) using nick columns and denatured by heat treatment for 100 s at 80 °C. After gel filtration (nick column) against anaerobic MPT buffer, the MPT-containing salt fraction was collected and used immediately for binding experiments. This fraction also contained the inactive air-oxidized product of MPT, Form B (15Johnson L.J. Hainline B.E. Arison B.H. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), formed during heat treatment of xanthine oxidase, which was analyzed in a way similar to Form A. In addition, FAD as another cofactor of xanthine oxidase was obtained by this preparation and was not further removed. MPT binding experiments were performed in a 400-ॖl volume using different concentrations of MPT (1–250 nm) in the presence of constant amounts of protein (30–500 nm). After 10 min of binding, substrate-bound and unbound protein fractions were separated by the following two methods. (a) The binding mixture was loaded on nick columns equilibrated with 100 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.2. Protein-containing fractions and the salt fractions were eluted with 700 ॖl of buffer and an additional 1200 ॖl of buffer, respectively. Because on the gel filtration column the bound/unbound-substrate equilibrium is changed, a large excluding fraction (700 ॖl) was collected to minimize the loss of bound MPT that dissociates from the protein during gel filtration. Immediately after gel filtration, 400 ॖl of each fraction was oxidized for MPT determination. Under control conditions, 47 of the unbound MPT in the salt fraction coeluted within the protein fraction, which was subtracted from the protein-bound MPT. (b) Alternatively, to prevent the possible change of the binding equilibrium, ultrafiltration experiments on small centrifugation units (microcon 30; Amicon) were performed. The binding mixture (400 ॖl) was concentrated to a final volume of 50–200 ॖl. The flow-through volume was measured, diluted to 400 ॖl, and immediately oxidized for MPT determination. The retained protein-containing fraction was then collected by inverse centrifugation (2 min, 3000 × g) and treated in the same way. Bound MPT was calculated as difference in MPT concentration. To detect and quantify MPT binding to the Cnx1 protein, MPT was converted to its oxidized fluorescent degradation product (dephospho-Form A) as originally described by Johnson et al. (15Johnson L.J. Hainline B.E. Arison B.H. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formed dephospho-Form A was further purified and desalted by anion exchange chromatography using 0.5-ml QAE-Sephadex columns (fine, acetate form, Sigma). The dephosphorylated sample was loaded on to a column previously washed with 10 ml of water. After sample application the column was washed with 10 ml of water and 1.6 ml of 10 mmacetic acid. Dephospho-Form A was subsequently eluted with 1.2 ml of 10 mm acetic acid and immediately analyzed on HPLC. HPLC was performed at room temperature with a Perkin-Elmer C18 reverse-phase column (4.6-mm inner diameter by 12.5 cm; 5-ॖm particle size), the Perkin-Elmer binary pump 250, a Rheodyne 7125 injector with a 250-ॖl sample loop, and an Shimadzu RF-551 spectrofluorimetric detector. The samples were chromatographed with isochratic flow (1 ml/min) in 50 mm ammonium acetate, 17.57 methanol as mobile phase, and dephospho-Form A was detected fluorimetrically (excitation, 370 nm; emission, 450 nm). The amount of Form A was quantified by integration of the fluorescent peak and compared with the integrated intensity of the standard compound. As standard, MPT that was purified in the same way from directly oxidized xanthine oxidase was used. The pooled pure HPLC fractions of Form A were lyophilized and resuspended in 0.1 n NaOH. The concentration of the standard compound was calculated from the absorbance at 380 nm using the extinction coefficient of 13,200 m−1cm−1 for dephospho-Form A (15Johnson L.J. Hainline B.E. Arison B.H. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinantly expressed Cnx1 protein contains a C-terminal extension of six His residues for affinity purification. The sequences encoding the conserved protein domains E and G (Fig.1), respectively, were cloned in the same way and in both cases contained the nonconserved interdomain spacer. All protein preparations were purified to more than 987 homogeneity. Proteins were stable at 4 °C for a couple of weeks after dialyzing and concentrating up to 1–5 mg/ml. N-terminal sequencing of purified proteins revealed the correct translation start. Fast protein liquid gel filtration chromatography of the Cnx1 holoprotein did not give a proper resolution of peaks; only dispersed peaks occurred with shoulders between 200 and 600 kDa where Cnx1 eluted in all fractions, indicating a wide range of different oligomers. In contrast, the gel filtration of the Cnx1 G domain resulted in two distinct peaks of equal size eluting at 80.2 and 152.2 kDa, representing a trimer (calculated 77.8 kDa) and an hexamer (calculated 155.6 kDa), respectively. Subsequent gel filtration of the separated trimer and hexamer resulted in an elution of the corresponding fraction as a single peak, indicating stable forms of multimers. On gel filtration, the majority of Cnx1 E domain behaved as a dimer (calculated 97.2 kDa) eluting at 84 kDa (data not shown). The isoelectric points of Cnx1 and the E domain were found to be at pH 5.2, and the G domain focused at pH 6.6 (data not shown). The previous characterization of mutants in Cnx1 and homologous proteins suggested a function of Cnx1 in the conversion of MPT into Moco (3Mendel R.R. Planta. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stallmeyer B. Nerlich A. Schiemann J. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Johnson M.E.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 166-185Google Scholar). To play this role, Cnx1 and particularly its G domain homologous toE. coli MogA should be able to interact/bind to MPT and/or Mo. Because of the extreme sensitivity of protein-free MPT to oxidation, a method is needed where binding of MPT to proteins and subsequent separation of bound and unbound MPT can be performed rapidly and in small volumes. Here we used gel filtration and ultrafiltration followed by I2/KI oxidation of MPT to its fluorescent dephosphorylated product Form A (2Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Johnson L.J. Hainline B.E. Arison B.H. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), subsequently quantified on HPLC and compared with a Form A standard (Fig.2 A). After coincubation of 184 nm MPT with 88 nmCnx1 G domain, 34 nm MPT could be detected in the excluded fraction of gel filtration (measured as Form A) represented by the single peak at 5 min of retention time (Fig. 2 C). Further, no Form B (air oxidation product of MPT (15Johnson L.J. Hainline B.E. Arison B.H. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was formed during MPT preparation by heat treatment of xanthine oxidase) is coeluting with protein so that the binding of MPT is very specific, and neither Form B nor some of the other contaminations from the salt fraction bind to the Cnx1 G domain. Using 88 and 164 nm Cnx1 G domain for binding experiments with different MPT concentrations (2–300 nm), the plot of bound and unbound MPT showed a typical Michaelis-Menten kinetic (Fig.3 A). By regression of both binding curves, a dissociation constant (k D) of 113 and 167 nm, respectively, was calculated (Fig.3 D), corresponding to a calculated number of binding sites of n = 64 nm (with 88 nmprotein) and n = 110 nm (with 164 nm protein), respectively (Fig. 3 D). Considering the errors indicated, a binding of 1 mol MPT to 1 mol Cnx1 G domain can be assumed, which confirms a nearly quantitative yield of Form A during MPT oxidation and purification on QAE chromatography and HPLC. Ultrafiltration was used for separating bound and free MPT after coincubation with Cnx1 G domain to avoid the change in equilibrium between free and protein-bound MPT that occurs during gel filtration experiments. The binding of MPT could be verified. Analysis of the absolute amounts of Form A and Form B in both the retained protein fraction and flow-through salt fraction showed an increase of Form A (representing the bound MPT) in the protein fraction, whereas Form B, which did not bind to Cnx1 G domain, is decreased (Fig. 2 D). Calculating the concentrations of Form A and Form B in both fractions showed no change in Form B concentration, whereas Form A (MPT) is highly increased in the protein fraction, which indicates MPT binding to the G domain. Using 142 nm protein for binding of different MPT concentrations (Fig. 3 A), ak D of 81 nm could be obtained from the fitted binding plot (Fig. 3 D). Taking into account the result obtained by gel filtration, a slow dissociation of bound MPT from Cnx1 G domain can be suggested with an averagek D of 120 nm for MPT binding to Cnx1 G domain. Using ultrafiltration, also the predicted equimolar binding could be confirmed (n = 119 nm, Fig.3 D). FAD was present in the MPT preparations used for the MPT binding assays. A typical preparation of 300 nm MPT yielded 20–30 ॖm FAD. Adding up to 300 ॖm FAD had no effect on the binding properties of Cnx1 G domain. Further, binding of FAD to Cnx1 G domain could not be detected in the presence nor in the absence of MPT, which was expected because no putative binding site for FAD was found within Cnx1. Using the E domain of Cnx1 for MPT binding experiments, on gel filtration a coelution of MPT in the protein fraction was found, however in lower quantities as compared with Cnx1 G domain. Using bovine serum albumin as control no coelution of MPT was detectable (Fig. 2 B). Analysis of protein-bound MPT (87 nm and 300 nm protein) at different MPT concentrations by plotting against unbound MPT resulted in a cooperative binding curve (Fig. 3 B). Postulating binding at equal molarities we calculated by Hill plotting ak D of 1.6 ॖm with a Hill coefficient of 1.50 (Fig. 3 D). The data show that both domains are able to bind MPT, but the binding types and affinities to MPT are different. Mixing both domains at equal ratios led to a superimposition of E and G domain binding plots, thus indicating no interference between the two separated domains (data not shown). Finally, as it was demonstrated for the two separated domains, also the entire Cnx1 protein was found to bind MPT (Fig.3 C). Using 300 and 408 nm protein, ak D of 182 nm could be calculated by Michaelis-Menten regression of the binding plot; however, by applying a cooperative regression a k D of 60 nm was found. Based on the curves shown in Fig. 3 C and the number of binding sites calculated by both regressions, the cooperative binding type (n H = 1.57) can be favored. Depending on the type of regression, a MPT/Cnx1 ratio of 1:8 to 1:15 was calculated, indicating a submolar saturation of the protein. The Cnx1 protein from A. thaliana consists of two domains that are homologous to two distinct E. coli proteins, both involved in Moco biosynthesis. This two-domain structure of Cnx1 formed the basis for our biochemical analysis of the separately expressed and purified domains of Cnx1 as compared with the entire Cnx1 protein. Not only the Cnx1 protein (4Stallmeyer B. Nerlich A. Schiemann J. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) but also its G domain alone (data not shown) is able to complement the E. coli mutant mogA, which shows that at least the G domain alone is functionally active.

Mutat. Res. 1973; 19: 175-185Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar) showed that (a) the defect of the mutation could be overcome by high concentrations of molybdate in the growth media and (b) the mutants are still able to synthesize MPT but not active Moco, so that it was suggested that Cnx1 is probably involved in a late step of Moco biosynthesis distal to the formation of MPT, i.e. insertion of Mo into MPT. Therefore Cnx1 should be able to interact with MPT and/or Mo. Our results presented here support this assumption, revealing that Cnx1 is able to bind MPT. The low k D of 0.1 ॖm for dissociation of bound MPT from the G domain of Cnx1 indicates a high affinity binding. Curve extrapolation shows an equimolar binding, which serves also as a good internal control for quantitation of MPT via Form A. Also the E domain of Cnx1 was found to bind MPT. This was surprising but confirms a functional link between both the E domain and the G domain. The higher k D of 1.6 ॖm on the basis of the cooperative binding type (n H = 1.5) indicates a weaker interaction between MPT and the E domain. The binding of MPT to the entire Cnx1 protein is comparable with that of the G domain; however, the binding type fitted better with a weak cooperative regression similar to that of the E domain. Thus the Cnx1 holoprotein reflects binding characteristics (high affinity combined with cooperativity) seen in both domains. Taking into account that both of the Cnx1 domains are able to bind MPT, one could speculate about a common binding fold occurring in both domains. In contrast to the G domain, not all Cnx1 protein could be saturated with MPT (binding ratio, 1:8 to 1:15). We can rule out degradation of Cnx1 as a possible explanation because both freshly prepared Cnx1 as well as Cnx1 stored for prolonged times showed a similar low ratio for MPT binding. Other reasons could be that part of the Cnx1 protein is inactive or that MPT binds only to specific Cnx1 multimers. The difference in MPT binding of the mixed separated domains to that of the entire Cnx1 protein reveals an as yet unknown interaction between the domains within the Cnx1 holoprotein where both domains are tightly linked. The Cnx1 G domain is a likely candidate for the binding of Mo becauseE. coli mutants in the homologous MogA protein are molybdate-repairable (7Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We could not, however, detect Mo bound to the G domain (data not shown). Perhaps there is a positive cooperativity (sequential binding) between MPT and Mo where Mo binds to the G domain only after the MPT-binding site is occupied by MPT. It is also possible that Mo binding is only of a transient nature during formation of Moco and cannot be readily detected in equilibrium binding experiments. Although speculative, we assume the following hierarchy of MPT binding to the Cnx1 protein: the G domain with high affinity for MPT acts as the initial MPT-acceptor. With ongoing saturation of the G domain, the critical concentration of MPT reaches a threshold, thereby enabling the neighboring E domain with lower binding affinity to take over MPT. This latter step is further facilitated by the E domain-specific cooperative character of binding with lower affinity. The postulated interaction between both domains could also explain the fusion of the two predecessor proteins observed during evolution. The results presented in this paper are the first biochemical evidence for Cnx1 to be directly involved in the conversion of MPT into Moco."

AP-1 is localized to the trans-Golgi network, where it mediates biosynthetic protein transport to the endosomal/lysosomal system, whereas AP-2 is localized to the plasma membrane and mediates rapid internalization of endocytic receptors. AP-1 is composed of four chains termed γ (∼91 kDa), ॆ1 (∼101 kDa), ॖ1 (∼47 kDa), and ς1 (∼19 kDa). The four chains of AP-2 are homologous to those of AP-1 and are known as α (∼104–108 kDa), ॆ2 (∼104 kDa), ॖ2 (∼50 kDa), and ς2 (∼17 kDa), respectively. The homologous chains of each complex are thought to subserve similar structural and functional roles. Two of the 舠large舡 chains, γ and α, mediate specific targeting of the corresponding adaptors to thetrans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane, respectively (3Robinson M.S. J.

Although the AP-1 complex has not yet been visualized by electron microscopy, limited proteolysis and sequence analyses of its chains suggest that it has an overall structure similar to AP-2 (6Schröder S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7910-7918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Additional insight into the structure of the AP-1 and AP-2 complexes was obtained from analyses of subunit interactions using the yeast two-hybrid system (4Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This approach revealed the following pairwise interactions for AP-1 subunits: γ-ॆ1, γ-ς1, and ॆ1-ॖ1; the analogous interactions observed for AP-2 were α-ॆ2, α-ς2, and ॆ2-ॖ2. Interactions were also detected between the ॆ and ॖ chains of different AP complexes (i.e. ॆ1-ॖ2 and ॆ2-ॖ1), which suggests that ॆ1 and ॆ2 may be interchangeable within the complexes. This is not surprising, since ॆ1 and ॆ2 are very closely related (857 identity and 927 similarity; Refs. 18Kirchhausen T. Nathanson K.L. Matsui W. Vaisberg A. Chow E.P. Burne C. Keen J.H. Davis A.E.

As expected from previous structural studies, all interactions involving the large chains (γ, α, ॆ1, and ॆ2) occurred at the level of their head domains (4Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J.

In contrast to the detailed information that is now available about the structure of the large chains, very little is known about the domain organization of the ॖ chains, as well as their arrangement within the AP complexes. These chains have been implicated in two types of interaction: assembly with the ॆ chains (4Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and recognition of tyrosine-based sorting signals (10Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S.

The regions of the molecules that are responsible for these functions and the relationship of these regions to the rest of the complex have not been established. In this study, we present a structure-function analysis of the ॖ chains aimed at identifying the domains that interact with the ॆ chains and with tyrosine-based sorting signals. These analyses reveal that both ॖ1 and ॖ2 can be functionally dissected into two parts: an amino-terminal one-third (residues 1–145 of ॖ1 and ॖ2) that interacts with the ॆ chains and the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds (residues 147–423 of ॖ1 and 164–435 of ॖ2) that bind tyrosine-based sorting signals. These observations suggest a model in which the amino-terminal one-third of ॖ2 is embedded within the AP-2 head via interaction with ॆ2, whereas the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the protein project outward from the head, placing this domain in a position to interact with tyrosine-based sorting signals.

S. Robinson (Department of Clinical Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom). All of the other two-hybrid constructs were made by ligation of polymerase chain reaction products into the pGBT9 or pACTII vectors (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The nucleotide sequences of all the recombinant constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain HF7c (MATa, ura3–52, HIS3-200, lys 2–801, ade2–101, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4–542, gal80–538, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3,URA3::(GAL417-mers)3 -CYC1-lacZ) (CLONTECH) was maintained on YPD agar plates. Transformation was done by the lithium acetate procedure as described in the instructions for the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid kit (CLONTECH). For colony growth assays, HF7c transformants were streaked on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and allowed to grow at 30 °C, usually for 4–5 days, until colonies were large enough for further assays. Quantitative growth assays were carried out as follows; 3–5 colonies of each HF7c transformant were added to 20 ml of liquid medium lacking histidine (−His medium) and grown at 30 °C to 1.0–1.2 OD600/ml. Cultures (3 × 10−3 OD600 units, ∼3 ॖl) were then inoculated into 20 ml of −His medium in the absence or presence of several concentrations of 3AT (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland). After 2 days of incubation at 30 °C, the OD600 of triplicates were measured. Results were expressed as the ratio of the signal obtained in the presence of 3AT and the signal obtained in its absence (control). ॆ-Galactosidase assays of HF7c transformants in liquid culture (5–7 colonies/culture) were done using a chemiluminescent ॆ-galactosidase assay kit (CLONTECH). Briefly, yeast cells were resuspended at 10 OD600/ml in lysis buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) and broken by vortexing in the presence of glass beads. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min in a microcentrifuge, 10–50 ॖl of the lysate was added onto 200 ॖl of kit reaction buffer, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and the light emission recorded as a 5-s integral in a tube luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Results were normalized by protein concentration and expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent determinations. Single amino acid substitutions to alanine in ॖ2 were made using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, 50 ng of pGBT9 or pACTII plasmids carrying the ॖ2 chain cDNA were incubated with two complementary primers (2 ॖm each) containing the desired mutation in the presence of 2 mm dNTP mix and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase for 16 cycles according to the following temperature profile: 0.5 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 8 or 16 min at 68 °C. After replication of both vector strands, the methylated parental DNA was digested for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 units of DpnI endonuclease, and the nicked vector having the desired mutation was transformed into Escherichia coli. Proteolytic cleavage of adaptor complexes was performed by incubating clathrin-coated vesicles (total protein concentration: 500 ॖg/ml; vesicles were kind gifts of E. Eisenberg and L. Green, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health and T. Kirchhausen, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) with different concentrations (1–1250 ॖg/ml) of trypsin (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 mm soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and the digested samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4–207 precast gradient gels; Novex, San Diego, CA) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. After incubation with primary antibodies to AP-2 chains and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, bands were detected using the ECL system (Amersham). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum (R11–29) to an amino-terminal sequence of the ॖ2 chain was obtained by immunization with a peptide corresponding to residues 11–29 of mouse ॖ2 (KGEVLISRVYRDDIGRNAV). This antibody was specific for ॖ2 and did not recognize the related protein ॖ1 (data not shown). Other antibodies used were: AC1-M11 (anti-α, Ref. 26Robinson M.S. J.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the clathrin-associated adaptor medium chains ॖ1 and ॖ2 interact with the ॆ2 chain of AP-2 (4Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J.

Bonifacino J.S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5789-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To further characterize these interactions, we used a yeast two-hybrid system in which the interacting polypeptides were expressed as fusions with the activation or binding domains of the transcriptional activator GAL4 (31Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Association of the two GAL4 domains driven by interacting polypeptides leads to activation of transcription of the HIS3 gene, which allows growth in defined media lacking histidine (−His), and of the lacZ gene, which results in expression of ॆ-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1). A qualitative assay for growth on −His plates confirmed that both ॖ1 and ॖ2 interacted with ॆ2 and with the YQRL signal (Fig.2 A). Interactions with the signal were dependent upon the critical tyrosine residue (Fig.2 A). To compare the apparent avidities of these interactions, we first monitored the growth of the transformed yeast strains in −His liquid medium (Fig. 2 B). In this assay, stronger interactions result in higher rates of growth. In addition, we developed a more discriminating assay in which the growth of transformed yeast strains in −His liquid medium was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of 3AT, an inhibitor of theHIS3-encoded enzyme imidazole-glycerol-phosphate dehydratase (Fig. 2 C). In this assay, the stronger the interactions between the two-hybrid partners, the higher the concentration of 3AT needed to inhibit growth. Both quantitative growth assays indicated that ॖ2-ॆ2 interactions were somewhat stronger than ॖ1-ॆ2 interactions (Fig. 2, B and C), consistent with previously published data (4Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The assays also revealed that ॖ2-YQRL interactions were much stronger than ॖ1-YQRL interactions, as evidenced by the marked differences of growth in liquid medium (Fig.2 B) and by the shift (2 orders of magnitude) of the 3AT inhibition curves (Fig. 2 C). To delineate the region of ॖ2 involved in interactions with ॆ2, we constructed a series of ॖ2 deletion mutants (Fig. 3 A) and evaluated them by two-hybrid assays for growth on −His plates (Fig.3 A), resistance to growth inhibition by 3AT (Fig.3 A), and ॆ-galactosidase activity (Fig. 3 B). All assays gave similar results. Deletion of the amino-terminal 120 amino acids of ॖ2 (construct 121–435) abrogated interaction with ॆ2. In contrast, constructs with deletions of up to 290 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of ॖ2 (e.g. construct 1–145) were able to interact with ॆ2. A further deletion leaving the amino-terminal 70 amino acids of ॖ2 (construct 1–70), however, completely abolished interaction with ॆ2. These observations suggested that the binding site for ॆ2 is contained within an amino-terminal segment of ॖ2 comprising amino acids 1–145. The same assays were used to examine interaction of ॖ2 deletion mutants with the YQRL signal (Fig. 4,A and B). We found that deletion of up to 163 amino acids from the amino terminus of ॖ2 (e.g. construct 164–435) had little or no effect on the ability of the protein to bind YQRL. Deletion of an additional 19 amino acids (construct 183–435), however, prevented interaction with the signal. Truncation of the last 23 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of ॖ2 (construct 1–412) did not prevent interaction with the signal, but removal of 25 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of a construct starting at amino acid 164 (construct 164–410) led to a complete loss of interaction. From these observations, we concluded that the YXXØ-binding region is contained within a carboxyl-terminal segment spanning amino acids 164–435, with the suggestion that the last 23 amino acids are dispensable for interactions. Taken together, the above experiments indicate that the ability to interact with ॆ2 resides within the amino-terminal one-third of ॖ2, whereas interactions with YXXØ-type signals are a function of the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the protein (see scheme in Fig.8). To further define the regions of ॖ2 involved in interactions with ॆ2 and with the YQRL signal, we introduced single amino acid substitutions (to alanine) within segments of ॖ2 that are highly homologous to segments of ॖ1 (TableI; see Fig. 8 for position of the residues). Most of the amino acids targeted for mutagenesis were identical in ॖ2 and ॖ1 and were contained within either the ॆ2-binding region (Leu-82, Tyr-83, Ile-96, and Glu-98) or the YXXØ-binding region of ॖ2 (Asp-176, Met-209, Phe-265, Asp-269, and Gly-270). We expected that the conservation of these amino acids would reflect an essential requirement for structure or function. The mutated ॖ2 constructs were tested for interactions using the 3AT growth inhibition assay (Table I) and the ॆ-galactosidase assay. The results of both assays demonstrated that mutation of Leu-82, Tyr-83, or Ile-96 significantly decreased interaction with ॆ2 but had little or no effect on the interaction with the YQRL signal (Table I and Fig.5, A and B). Conversely, mutation of either Asp-176, Met-209, Phe-265, Asp-269, or Gly-270 had no effect on interaction with ॆ2 but significantly decreased interaction with the YQRL signal (Fig. 5, A andB). Mutation of Glu-98 resulted in slight but significant decreases in interactions with both ॆ2 and YQRL, suggesting that this particular mutation has a more general effect on the structure of ॖ2. The differential effects of most of these mutations are consistent with the results of the deletion analysis (Figs. 3 and 4) and thus reaffirm the idea that the ॆ2- and YXXØ-binding sites are contained within the segments 1–145 and 164–435, respectively. The fact that various mutations resulted in reduction of binding suggests that the conserved residues tested are either all involved in interactions with ॆ2 or YXXØ or required for the conformational integrity of the ॆ2- and YXXØ-binding domains.Table IBinding characteristics of ॖ2 point mutants analyzed by 3AT inhibition assaysMutants(IC50)mutant/(IC50)WTॆ2 bindingYQRL bindingL82A0.30 ± 0.050.78 ± 0.20Y83A0.58 ± 0.150.80 ± 0.14I96A0.11 ± 0.030.74 ± 0.18E98A0.70 ± 0.200.80 ± 0.10D176A1.03 ± 0.100.60 ± 0.10M209A0.98 ± 0.120.02 ± 0.01F265A0.96 ± 0.150.20 ± 0.07D269A0.95 ± 0.100.20 ± 0.12G270A1.10 ± 0.200.20 ± 0.06All residues targeted for mutagenesis were identical in ॖ2 and ॖ1, except for Ile-96 in ॖ2, which is replaced by a leucine in ॖ1.

As shown in Fig. 2, ॖ1 is also capable of interacting with ॆ2 and YXXØ-type signals (4Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Ohno H.

This observation, in conjunction with the fact that ॖ1 and ॖ2 share 407 identity and 647 similarity over the entire length of their polypeptide chains (32Nakayama Y. Goebl M. O'Brine Greco B. Lemmon S. Pingchang Chow E. Kirchhausen T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggests that ॖ1 and ॖ2 may have a similar domain organization. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a small number of ॖ1 deletion mutants (Fig. 6) that were analogous to key ॖ2 constructs. Using various yeast two-hybrid assays, we found that segments of ॖ1 spanning amino acids 1–145 and 147–423 interacted with ॆ2 and YQRL, respectively (Fig.6). This observation indicated that ॖ1 and ॖ2 have a similar, bipartite domain organization. All the experiments described thus far were performed with isolated medium chains using the yeast two-hybrid system. To examine how these results correlated with the domain organization of ॖ2 in the context of the complete AP-2 complex, we performed proteolytic digestion experiments. To this end, we treated purified brain clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), which contain clathrin-AP-2 assemblies, with trypsin. Digestions were performed on CCVs rather than purified AP-2 because ॖ2 was found to be more sensitive to proteolysis in CCVs (33Matsui W. Kirchhausen T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10791-10798Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The trypsin-digested samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies to AP-2 subunits (Fig. 7). As expected from previous work (6Schröder S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7910-7918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zaremba S. Keen J.H. J. Cell.

Nathanson K.L. Matsui W. Vaisberg A. Chow E.P. Burne C. Keen J.H. Davis A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2612-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the α and ॆ chains were cleaved into ∼60-kDa and ∼40-kDa fragments, which corresponded to the head and ear domains, respectively (Fig. 7, A–D). The cleavage pattern of ॖ2 was investigated using an antibody to residues 11–29 of the protein (Fig. 7 F); thus, all the ॖ2 fragments identified in the immunoblots contained the amino terminus of the protein. Treatment with low concentrations of trypsin resulted in cleavage of full-length ॖ2 (apparent molecular mass ∼50 kDa) into a species of 27 kDa; with increasing trypsin concentrations, the 27-kDa species disappeared concomitant with the appearance of a 25-kDa species (Fig. 7 F). These observations are in agreement with previous work of Matsui and Kirchhausen (33Matsui W. Kirchhausen T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10791-10798Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that a similarly generated 25-kDa fragment of ॖ2 corresponds approximately to the amino-terminal half of the protein. Treatment with higher concentrations of trypsin resulted in conversion of the 27–25-kDa species into a 17-kDa fragment and eventually a 15-kDa fragment (Fig.7 F). No fragments smaller than 15 kDa were observed, even at the highest concentration of trypsin tested (1.25 mg/ml); at this concentration, virtually all of the ॖ2 was cleaved into the 15-kDa fragment (Fig. 7 F). Thus, these experiments demonstrated the existence of trypsin-sensitive sites at about one-third and one-half of the ॖ2 polypeptide chain, from the amino terminus. The amino-terminal one-third of ॖ2 likely represents an independent folding domain of ॖ2 and roughly corresponds to the region of ॖ2 involved in ॆ2 binding. The resistance of this ॖ2 domain to proteolysis may be due to its location within the AP-2 core. On the other hand, the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of ॖ2 (which contains the YXXØ-binding region) appear to be accessible to the protease in the context of the AP-2 complex. The results of the two-hybrid analyses presented here suggest that the ॖ2 chain of AP-2 has a bipartite structure, with the amino-terminal one-third of the molecule (amino acids 1–145) being involved in assembly with the ॆ2 chain and the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds (amino acids 164–435) being responsible for the recognition of YXXØ-type sorting signals (Fig.8). A more limited analysis of ॖ1 suggests that this protein has a similar bipartite structure. The two functional regions of ॖ2 are completely separable and remain fully active in the absence of the other part of the molecule. Moreover, point mutations can be introduced within each of the two regions that impair one type of interaction without affecting the other. The functional domain organization of ॖ2 suggested by the two-hybrid analyses is consistent with the location of a major trypsin-sensitive site at about one-third of the polypeptide chain relative to the amino terminus (Fig. 7). The amino-terminal one-third of the molecule is very resistant to proteolysis, which may be due to its interaction with ॆ2 within the AP-2 core. The ॆ2- and YXXØ-binding domains are separated by an intervening region (at a minimum comprising amino acids 146–163) that does not appear to be required for either interaction. Comparison of adaptor medium chain sequences reveals that the 146–163 segment corresponds to a stretch of low similarity (Fig. 8, bracketin upper graph). These observations suggest that the segment encompassing amino acids 146–163 may act as a linker between the ॆ2- and YXXØ-binding domains of ॖ2. Linker sequences often appear as loops in the three-dimensional structure of proteins (34Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland Publishers, New York1991Google Scholar). This may also be the case for the 146–163 segment, as analysis of secondary structure predicts a high probability of a loop in that region (Fig. 8, bracket in lower graph). Another region of low sequence similarity in the adaptor medium chains occurs at amino acids 220–250 of ॖ2 (Fig. 8, upper graph). This region also contains a trypsin-sensitive site that was reported previously by Matsui and Kirchhausen (33Matsui W. Kirchhausen T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10791-10798Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and confirmed in this study (Fig. 7). We speculate that this region might constitute another linker connecting two subdomains, both of which are required for YXXØ binding. The inability to trim further the YXXØ-binding region (residues 164–412) without losing binding activity may be due to the involvement of both of these subdomains in interactions with signals. The ॖ1 and ॖ2 chains are members of a growing family of homologous coat proteins that also includes ॖ3A and ॖ3B (formerly known as p47A and p47B; Ref. 35Pevsner J. Volknandt W. Wong B.R.

Auerbach S. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Wegchingel S. Lottspeich F. Stenbeck G. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Tschochner H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and exhibits ∼207 identity to ॖ1 and ॖ2. It is currently unknown whether δ-COP interacts with any signals; however, two-hybrid analyses have shown that it interacts with ॆ-COP, the chain of COPI related to ॆ1 and ॆ2 (38Faulstich D. Auerbach S. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Wegchingel S. Lottspeich F. Stenbeck G. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Tschochner H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). While still fragmentary, all of this evidence suggests that the ॖ and ॆ chain homologs of various coat protein complexes might be involved in similar types of interaction. Given that the homology among ॖ chain family members extends throughout their entire polypeptide chains, we anticipate that they will have a similar functional domain organization as well as a similar arrangement within their respective complexes. The mode of assembly exemplified by ॖ-ॆ interactions may in fact apply to other interactions within the adaptor complexes. Indeed, the small chains ς1 and ς2 have been shown to interact specifically with the γ and α chains of AP-1 and AP-2, respectively (4Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Strikingly, all members of the small chain family described to date (ς1, ς2, ς3A, ς3B, and ζ-COP) bear low but significant homology to the amino-terminal half of the medium chains (37Cosson P. Demolliere C. Henecke S. Duden R. Letourneur F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 40Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S.

This suggests that a large portion of the small chains may be dedicated to interactions with a member of the α-γ-δ family, perhaps leaving a short carboxyl-terminal extension available for some other function. On the basis of the results presented here, we propose that the ॖ2 chain is anchored to the AP-2 core via interaction of ॆ2 with an amino-terminal segment comprising approximately one-third of the ॖ2 polypeptide chain. The remaining two-thirds of ॖ2 likely project outward from the AP-2 core, placing this domain of ॖ2 in a position to interact with tyrosine-based sorting signals. Our data also suggest that ॖ1 may be similarly arranged within the AP-1 complex, and that this structural organization of the medium chains may be a general feature of all adaptor complexes.

To understand better the role of Stats in PRL signaling, we cloned rat Stat5b from a PRL-responsive T cell line Nb2. A Stat5b-specific peptide antibody was generated. In PRL receptor reconstituted COS cells cotransfected with Stat5b or Stat5a, both Stat5 proteins become tyrosine phosphorylated and bind to the IRF-1 GAS (interferon-γ activation sequence) element in a PRL-inducible manner. Unexpectedly, both Stat5b and Stat5a inhibit PRL induction of the IRF-1 promoter, but they mediate PRL stimulation of the ॆ-casein promoter. Stat5-mediated inhibition was observed only at the native IRF-1 promoter and not at the isolated IRF-1 GAS element linked to a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter. Mutational analyses showed that the DNA binding activity of Stat5b is not required, but the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain is essential for Stat5b to inhibit PRL induction of the IRF-1 promoter. These results suggest that Stat5b mediates inhibition via protein-protein interactions. In contrast, both DNA binding and transactivation domains of Stat5b are required to mediate PRL induction of the ॆ-casein promoter. Furthermore, a carboxyl-terminal truncated dominant negative Stat5b can reverse Stat5b inhibition at the IRF-1 promoter. These studies suggest that Stat proteins can act as not only positive but also negative regulators of gene transcription. Further, Stat5 can modulate gene expression without binding to DNA but via protein-protein interactions.

Cytokine binding to its receptor rapidly activates JAK tyrosine kinases, which are either prebound or recruited to the receptor upon tyrosine phosphorylation. Activated JAK tyrosine kinases then phosphorylate the receptor itself and Stats that are recruited to the receptor through the interaction between the Src homology (SH2) domain on the Stats and phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the receptor. Phosphorylated Stats form homo- or heteromeric complexes, translocate into the nucleus, bind to specific DNA elements, and participate in target gene transcription. Four members of the JAK tyrosine kinase family (4Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F.

These signaling molecules are utilized in various combinations to mediate signal transduction by the members of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Stat5a or mammary gland factor, originally cloned from the sheep mammary gland, was shown to be induced by prolactin (PRL) to activate the transcription of the milk protein ॆ-casein gene, a marker for mammary cell differentiated functions (6Wakao H.

PRL is a pituitary peptide hormone that stimulates cellular proliferation and differentiation of many different cell types (8Horseman N.D. Yu-Lee L.-y. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 627-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A role of PRL as a T cell cytokine has been elucidated (9Hooghe R. Delhase M. Vergani P. Malur A. Hooghe-Peters E.L. Immunol.

PRL activates T cells by binding to the PRL receptor (PRL-R) which is a member of the cytokine/hematopoietin receptor superfamily (8Horseman N.D. Yu-Lee L.-y. Endocr.

The rat Nb2 T lymphoma cell line (13Gout P.W. Beer C.T. Noble R.L. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 2433-2436PubMed Google Scholar) has been used extensively as a model system to study the molecular mechanisms underlying PRL signaling in T cells (14Yu-Lee L.-y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 215: 35-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory have found that PRL induces the expression of a number of early growth-related genes including interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) as part of an early activation program leading to mitogenesis (15Stevens A.M. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2236-2243PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yu-Lee L.-y. Hrachovy J.A. Stevens A.M. Schwarz L.A. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1992; 86: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our studies have identified the interferon-γ activation sequence (GAS) in the IRF-1 promoter as a PRL-responsive enhancer element (18Stevens A.M. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 345-355PubMed Google Scholar, 19Stevens A.M. Wang Y.-f. Sieger K.A. Lu H.-f. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 513-525PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wang Y.-f. O'Neal K.D. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1353-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). More recently, we have found that Stat1 and Stat5a become tyrosine phosphorylated and bind to the IRF-1 GAS element in a time-dependent manner in PRL-stimulated Nb2 T cells (19Stevens A.M. Wang Y.-f. Sieger K.A. Lu H.-f. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 513-525PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wang Y.-f. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To understand better PRL-R-mediated mitogenic signaling in Nb2 T cells through the JAK/Stat/IRF-1 pathway, we cloned the PRL-inducible Stat5b (EMBL accession number X97541) by screening an Nb2 T cell cDNA library and generated an anti-Stat5b peptide-specific antibody (Ab). Stat5b and Stat5a are found to be equally expressed in Nb2 T cells. In PRL-R and Stat5b or Stat5a cotransfected COS cells, both Stat5b and Stat5a become tyrosine phosphorylated rapidly upon PRL stimulation and bind to the IRF-1 GAS element. Unexpectedly, this PRL-inducible interaction of Stat5b and Stat5a led to an inhibition of PRL-inducible IRF-1 promoter activity while they stimulated PRL-inducible ॆ-casein promoter activity. The inhibitory effects of Stat5b on the IRF-1 promoter appear to be independent of DNA binding but involve protein-protein interactions through its COOH-terminal transactivation domain. In contrast, both the DNA binding and transactivation domains of Stat5b are required for mediating PRL induction of the milk protein ॆ-casein promoter. These studies show that PRL-inducible Stat proteins can mediate stimulation or inhibition of gene transcription depending on the target promoters. Nb2-11C T lymphoma cells were cultured as described previously (19Stevens A.M. Wang Y.-f. Sieger K.A. Lu H.-f. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 513-525PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 and 293T fibroblast (22Lebrun J. Suhad A. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) cells, both harboring SV40 large T antigen, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 107 fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) and 25 ॖg/ml gentamycin (Sigma). A 237-bp reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction DNA corresponding to the sheep Stat5a SH2 domain (6Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) was used to screen a cDNA library prepared from the PRL-dependent rat Nb2-11C cell line (16Yu-Lee L.-y. Hrachovy J.A. Stevens A.M. Schwarz L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3087-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Three Stat5a and seven overlapping Stat5b cDNA clones were obtained. After rescreening the Nb2 cDNA library using a 518-bp polymerase chain reaction DNA corresponding to the 5′ most available Stat5b sequence (clone 3), a full-length Stat5b cDNA clone (clone 4) was obtained and sequenced using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The 3.6-kb Stat5b cDNA was released with EcoRI and subcloned into the pRc/CMV and pcDNA3.1(−) mammalian expression vectors (Invitrogen, San Diego). The 3.7-kb rat Stat5a cDNA was released with EcoRI from the pBK/CMV vector (23Kazansky A.V. Raught B. Lindsey S.M. Wang Y.-f. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1598-1609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and recloned into the pRc/CMV vector to have the same vector background. Stat5b DNA-binding mutants were generated using a QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Amino acids EE at positions 437 and 438 or VVVI at positions 466–469 were replaced by alanine, respectively. The oligonucleotide primers 5′-TCGGTCACGGcAGcGAAGTTCACAATC-3′ and 5′-GATTGTGAACTTCcCTgCCGTGACCGA-3′, 5′-CCTTGTCGCTCCCGGcGGcGGcGgcCGTTCACGGCAGCCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGCTGCCGTGAACGgcCgCCgCCgCCGGGAGCGACAAGG-3′ (lowercase represents mutations), were used for E437A/E438A and V466A/V467A/V468A/I469A mutations, respectively. The Stat5bEE and Stat5bVVVI mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Stat5bΔ40C (gift of Dr. Georg H. Fey, Friedrich-Alexander University, Erlangen, Germany), which lacks the COOH-terminal 40 amino acids of Stat5b (24Ripperger J.A. Fritz S. Richter K. Hocke G.M. Lottspeich F. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29998-30006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), was released with EcoRI/NotI from pSV-Sport I vector and recloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). A 10-amino acid peptide (DSQWIPHAQS, amino acids 777–786) corresponding to the unique COOH-terminal sequence of Stat5b (containing an added Lys at the COOH terminus) was synthesized and coupled to a multiple antigenic peptide resin (Peptide Synthesis Core Laboratory, Baylor College of Medicine). Two rabbits were immunized with 1 mg of this peptide plus complete adjuvant and boosted with the same dose plus incomplete adjuvant six times. Antisera were collected and stored at −20 °C. Stat5b and Stat5a were transcribed and translated in vitro using the T3 TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega, Madison, WI) with 40 ॖCi of [35S]methionine as described previously (25Axtell S.M. Truong T.M. O'Neal K.D. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 312-318PubMed Google Scholar). 5 ॖl of each reaction mixture was resolved by 7.57 SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography to examine the size of Stat5b and Stat5a or used for immunoprecipitation with anti-Stat5b and anti-Stat5a Abs. To determine the specificity of anti-Stat5b Ab and the activation of Stat5 by PRL, COS cells cotransfected with the Nb2 PRL-R (26O'Neal K.D. Yu-Lee L.-y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26076-26082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Stat5b, Stat5a, Stat5bEE, Stat5bVVVI, Stat5bΔ40C, or vector control (see below) were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 17 Nonidet P-40, 0.27 sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 ॖg/ml aprotinin, and 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin). 20 ॖg of proteins from each condition were separated by 7.57 SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for Western blot analysis using a 1:5,000 dilution of anti-Stat5b or a 1:3,000 dilution of anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), followed by enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) development (Amersham Corp.) as described previously (21Wang Y.-f. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Axtell S.M. Truong T.M. O'Neal K.D. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 312-318PubMed Google Scholar). The same blot used for immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb was incubated in stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 27 SDS, 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.7) for 30 min at 55 °C with agitation, washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.17 Tween 20), blocked with 57 non-fat milk in TBST at 4 °C overnight, and then immunoblotted with a 1:250 dilution of anti-Stat5 mAb (amino acids 451–649) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). To examine Stat5b and Stat5a protein expression in Nb2 T cells, 107 cells were lysed in 100 ॖl of 17 SDS, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1 mmdithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min. Cell lysates were diluted with 800 ॖl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.57 Nonidet P-40, 0.27 SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin) and precleared by incubation with preimmune serum for 2 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A-agarose (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA) for another 2 h. 1.25 ॖg of anti-Stat5 mAb, 5 ॖl of anti-Stat5b, or 5 ॖl of affinity-purified anti-Stat5a1 (23Kazansky A.V. Raught B. Lindsey S.M. Wang Y.-f. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1598-1609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Ab was then added and incubated for 2 h followed by incubation with protein A-agarose for another 2 h. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed extensively, resolved by 7.57 SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane for Western blot analysis using a 1:250 dilution of anti-Stat5 mAb followed by ECL detection. Whole cell extracts of transfected COS cells were prepared in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 207 glycerol, 0.55 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin, and 1 ॖg/ml aprotinin) and dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 207 glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate). Overlapping complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides containing the rat IRF-1 GAS element, top strand, 5′-AACAGCCTGATTTCCCCGAAATG-3′, and bottom strand, 5′-TCATCATTTCGGGGAAATCAGGCTGTT-3′ (Genosys Biotechnologies Inc., Woodlands, TX), were annealed and filled in by Klenow using [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]dTTP, and unlabeled dGTP. The 27-mer double-stranded labeled GAS probe was purified by a Sephadex G-25 Quick Spin column (Boehringer Mannheim). EMSAs were performed as described previously (19Stevens A.M. Wang Y.-f. Sieger K.A. Lu H.-f. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 513-525PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kazansky A.V. Raught B. Lindsey S.M. Wang Y.-f. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1598-1609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also employed were two control oligonucleotides, a 32-mer mutant GAS oligonucleotide 5′-CGGGATCCTGATgaCaCCGActTGAGATCTTC-3′ (lowercase represents GAS mutations) and an unrelated 27-mer oligonucleotide, DR1, which contains the COUP transcription factor binding site 5′-GAGCCGATCCTTAGGGGTCAAAGGTCAAAGGATGGAA-3′ (27Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Anti-Stat1 mAb (amino acids 1–194) (ISGF3 G16920) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. 2 × 105/well of COS or 293 fibroblast cells was seeded in six-well tissue culture plates overnight in DMEM containing 107 fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were rinsed twice with serum-free DMEM and incubated with a LipofectAMINE-DNA mixture in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM. After 5 h, 2 ml of DMEM with 17 horse serum (ICN-Flow Laboratories, Mclean, VA) was then added. For Western blot assays and EMSA, each well contained 3 ॖg of Nb2 PRL-R (26O'Neal K.D. Yu-Lee L.-y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26076-26082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 3 ॖg of either Stat5b, Stat5a, or vector control, and 15 ॖl of LipofectAMINE. At 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with or without 100 ng/ml ovine PRL (NIDDK-oPRL-20) for 30 min, harvested by scraping, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and either lysed for Western blot analysis or used for whole cell extraction for EMSA. For CAT assays, 2 ॖg of Nb2 PRL-R, between 0.05 and 2 ॖg of Stat (Stat5b, Stat5a, Stat5bEE, Stat5bVVVI, Stat5bΔ40C, or vector control), 0.2 ॖg of IRF-1-CAT (1.7-kb, 205-bp, 136-bp, and 112-bp IRF-1-CAT 19), 0.2 ॖg of three copies of the IRF-1 GAS in thymidine kinase (TK)-CAT (3C GAS-TK-CAT), or 1 ॖg of 2.3-kb ॆ-casein-CAT (28Lee K.-F. Atiee S.H. Henning S.J. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 3: 447-453Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were used. At 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with or without 100 ng/ml PRL for another 24 h. Cell extracts were prepared by four cycles of freezing-thawing in 0.25 m Tris, pH 7.4, normalized by protein concentration and assayed for CAT enzyme activity as described previously (18Stevens A.M. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 345-355PubMed Google Scholar), or prepared by using a Reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed as described by the manufacturer. In our experiments, extracts normalized to equal amounts of protein or equal expression of CMV-ॆ-galactosidase gave similar results (18Stevens A.M. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 345-355PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, between 2 and 5 ॖg of cell extracts, 50 ॖl of 3 mg/ml acetylcoenzyme A (Sigma) or 5 ॖl of 5 mg/mln-butyrylcoenzyme A (Promega), and 3 ॖl of [14C]chloramphenicol (50 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) were used and assayed for 4 h at 37 °C. CAT activity was analyzed by thin layer chromatography or liquid scintillation counting. CAT conversion measured by thin layer chromatography was quantitated further by using the Betascope 603 blot analyzer (Betagen, Mountain View, CA). Fold induction by PRL was calculated as described (18Stevens A.M. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 345-355PubMed Google Scholar) and plotted by using the CA-Cricket Graph III (Computer Associates International, Inc., Islandia, NY). Our previous studies have shown that PRL stimulation of Nb2 T cells leads to a biphasic transcriptional induction of the growth-related IRF-1 gene (15Stevens A.M. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol.

The initial goal of this study was to determine how Stat5 may be involved in the PRL signaling pathway to the IRF-1 gene in T cells. However, at that time Stat5 had not been cloned from rodents. Accordingly, we screened a rat Nb2 T cell cDNA library using a 237-bp reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction DNA obtained from the rat mammary gland, which corresponds to the SH2 domain of the sheep Stat5a, as a probe (23Kazansky A.V. Raught B. Lindsey S.M. Wang Y.-f. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1598-1609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several rat Stat5a and Stat5b cDNA clones were obtained. One of these Stat5b clones contains 110-bp 5′-noncoding, 2,358-bp coding, and about 1,200-bp 3′-noncoding sequences (EMBL accession number X97541; data not shown). Sequence analysis of this full-length Stat5b cDNA shows 907 homology at the nucleotide level and 967 homology at the amino acid level between rat Stat5b and rat Stat5a (23Kazansky A.V. Raught B. Lindsey S.M. Wang Y.-f. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1598-1609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 99.27 homology at the amino acid level between rat and mouse Stat5b (33Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). However, four amino acid (Ala296, Val328, Ala489, and Pro690) differences are observed between our Stat5b sequence and that cloned recently from the rat liver (Leu296, Ser328, Arg489, Arg690) (24Ripperger J.A.

These differences are most likely due to sequencing error (Ala296 (GCT) to Leu (CTG); Val328 (GTC) to Ser (TCG); Ala489 (GCA) to Arg (CGA); Pro690 (CCC) to Arg (CGC)), as our rat sequences at these positions are identical to those of mouse Stat5b (33Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). As also found in the mouse and human, rat Stat5b 1) has a PCEPA five-amino acid insertion (amino acids 687–691) at the end of the highly conserved SH2 domain and immediately upstream of the critical tyrosine residue (Y699); 2) has eight distinct amino acids at the carboxyl terminus; and 3) is seven amino acids shorter than rat Stat5a. To assess the protein size of rat Stat5b, Stat5b was transcribed and translated using T3 RNA polymerase in the TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system as described previously (25Axtell S.M. Truong T.M. O'Neal K.D. Yu-Lee L.-y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 312-318PubMed Google Scholar). A single predominant [35S]methionine-labeled protein of approximately 95 kDa was observed in the Stat5b TNT lysate (Fig.1 A, lane 1) but not in the pBluescript SK− vector control lysate (Fig. 1 A,lane 3). Although Stat5b is only seven amino acids shorter than Stat5a, it resolves as a slightly smaller band than the in vitro translated Stat5a protein (∼96 kDa) (Fig. 1 A,lane 2). To analyze Stat5b protein expression further, a polyclonal rabbit anti-Stat5b peptide Ab was raised against a unique 10-amino acid peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of Stat5b. The specificity of anti-Stat5b Ab was determined by its ability to immunoprecipitate TNT-Stat5b protein specifically but not in vitro translated Stat5a protein (data not shown). This anti-Stat5b Ab specifically immunoblotted recombinant Stat5b protein produced in control and PRL-stimulated Stat5b-transfected COS cells (Fig.1 B, lanes 1 and 2) but not Stat5a-transfected (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and4) or control vector-transfected (Fig. 1 B,lanes 5 and 6) COS cells. The anti-Stat5b Ab also immunoprecipitated native Stat5b protein from Nb2 T cells (Fig.1 C, lane 1). The previously reported affinity-purified anti-Stat5a1 peptide Ab did not recognize TNT-Stat5b protein (data not shown) but did immunoprecipitate Stat5a protein from Nb2 T cells (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). Both Stat5b and Stat5a proteins are expressed equally in Nb2 T cells, as shown by immunoprecipitation with a commercially available anti-Stat5 mAb directly against the commonly shared SH3 and SH2 domains of the Stat5 proteins (Fig. 1 C, lane 3). To study the transactivation potential of Stat5b, we first examined its activation by PRL after transient transfection into COS cells. COS cells were chosen because these cells have been used successfully for analysis of PRL-inducible ॆ-casein and ॆ-lactoglobulin promoter activation (7Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B.

In this and subsequent transfections, PRL-R reconstituted COS cells were generated by transient transfection with the Nb2 PRL-R along with Stat5b, Stat5a, or empty vector control. To determine whether Stat5b can be phosphorylated by PRL stimulation, Stat5b phosphorylation was examined by anti-phosphotyrosine mAb immunoblotting after stimulation with PRL for 30 min. Stat5b as well as Stat5a became highly phosphorylated only after PRL stimulation (Fig.2 A, lanes 4 and6). Both Stat5b (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and4) and Stat5a (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and6) proteins were expressed abundantly after transfection into COS cells. In control cells transfected with empty vector alone, no Stat5b or Stat5a phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2) or steady-state proteins (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1 and 2) were detected, sugg"

Cleavage occurs carboxyl-terminally of basic amino acid motifs, such as RX(K/R)R, RXXR, and (R/K)R. As already available for the other known mammalian members of this enzyme family, we here define structural and functional features of human lymphoma proprotein convertase (LPC). Analysis of expression of recombinant LPC in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells reveals biosynthesis of a 92-kDa nonglycosylated precursor (proLPC) and a 102-kDa endoglycosidase H-sensitive glycosylated form of proLPC. Only the latter is further processed and after propeptide removal converted into a complexlyN-glycosylated mature form of LPC of about 92 kDa. Co-expression experiments of truncated LPC with an active site mutant of LPC (LPCS265A) indicate that prodomain removal of LPC occurs via an autoproteolytic, intramolecular mechanism, as was demonstrated before for some of the other members of this enzyme family. Prodomain removal is shown to be required for LPC to exit the endoplasmic reticulum. As far as subcellular localization is concerned, immunocytochemical, ultrastructural, and biochemical analyses show that LPC is concentrated in the trans-Golgi network, associated with membranes, and not secreted. Carboxyl-terminal domains are critically involved in this cellular retention, because removal of both the hydrophobic region and the cytoplasmic tail of LPC results in secretion. Of interest are the observations that LPC is not phosphorylated like furin but is palmitoylated in its cytoplasmic tail. Finally, substrate specificity of LPC is similar to that of furin but not identical. Whereas for furin a basic substrate residue at position P-2 is dispensable, it is essential for LPC. For optimal LPC substrate processing activity, an arginine at position P-6 is preferred over an arginine at P-4.

All known subtilases are multi-domain serine proteases consisting of a signal peptide preceding the pro, catalytic, middle, and cytoplasmic domains. Homology is highest in the catalytic domains (containing the fully conserved catalytic triad, aspartate-histidine-serine) but diverges toward the carboxyl-terminal domains. To date, seven mammalian proprotein convertases have been identified, including furin, PC1/PC3, PC2, PC4, PACE4, PC5/PC6, and LPC (3Van de Ven W.J.M. Roebroek A. Van Duijnhoven J.L.P. Crit. Rev.

LPC is widely expressed but not as ubiquitously as furin. LPC RNA has been demonstrated both in early embryonal stages (24Constam D.B. Calfon M. Robertson E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as well as in several adult tissues and cell lines (5Meerabux J. Yaspo M.-L. Roebroek A.J.M. Van de Ven W.J.M. Lister T.A.

Van de Ven W.J.M. Lister T.A. Young B.D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 448-451PubMed Google Scholar), but based on phylogeny analysis it has been suggested that LPC is more related to kexin of yeast than are other mammalian members of this family (23Seidah N.G. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi M. Dong W. Tadros H. Mbikay M. Chrétien M. Day R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3388-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Detailed structural and functional characteristics have been described for most of the mammalian proprotein convertases. Being the most recent member, such detailed information, which is crucial for further studies, is not yet available for LPC. Therefore, the main objective of the present report is to define such structural and functional characteristics of LPC. Studies of LPC presented here include 1) its biosynthesis, 2) its post-translational processing and modifications,i.e. glycosylation, palmitoylation, and phosphorylation, 3) its subcellular localization, and 4) its proprotein processing activity as well as specificity. A GLC-1-M13 (lung tumor cell line) cDNA library in λgt11 was screened with a human LPC probe (5Meerabux J. Yaspo M.-L. Roebroek A.J.M. Van de Ven W.J.M. Lister T.A. Young B.D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 448-451PubMed Google Scholar) and a 3.4-kb LPC cDNA was isolated and cloned as an EcoRI fragment in pGEM-3Zf(+). For expression in the VV:T7/PK(15) system, a 2.6-kb SacI subfragment encompassing the complete LPC protein coding region was cloned into pGEM-3Zf(+). For expression in COS-1 and CHO-DHFR− cells, this 2.6-kb LPC cDNA subfragment was recloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). LPC mutants lacking the carboxyl terminus (LPCΔcyt; introduction of a stop codon after Ser548), the hydrophobic domain as well as the carboxyl terminus (LPCΔtm+cyt; introduction of a stop codon after Thr526), and the active site mutant of LPC (LPCS265A; Ser265→Ala), were generated using the altered sitesin vitro mutagenesis system (Promega) according to the guidelines of the supplier. For this purpose the 2.6-kb LPC SacI cDNA subfragment was recloned into pSELECT (Promega). The sequences of the mutagenic primers (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) used were 5′-GTATATTTGAGCTAGCGGAATGTGGCTT-3′ (LPCΔcyt), 5′-ACCCTCAAGACCTAGGTGCTGGTAGG-3′ (LPCΔtm+cyt), and 5′-GAGGGCCACACAGGTACCGCAGCTGCAGCGCCT-3′ (LPCS265A), with the mutated nucleotides underlined.

CHO-DHFR− cells (Chinese hamster ovary; ATCC, CRL 9096) were cultured in minimal essential medium α containing ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum. For transfections, typically 8–10 × 105 cells were transfected with 2 ॖg of DNA (1 ॖg of each cDNA supplemented with vector DNA when needed) and 6 ॖl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's guidelines unless mentioned otherwise.

Neomycin-resistant colonies were picked and screened for expression by indirect immunofluorescence.

For the preparation of antisera with specificity for human LPC, two peptide conjugates were used (Research Genetics Inc., Huntsville, AL). Peptide Lys−2-Arg18 was synthesized as a multiple antigenic peptide conjugate. Peptide Cys585-Ser604 was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with each peptide conjugate, followed by five boosts (one every 4 weeks). Four sera were obtained: MP1 and MP2 directed against the multiple antigenic peptide conjugate and KP1 and KP2 directed against the keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate. All sera were tested in Western blotting, immunoprecipitation analysis, and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Sera KP1 and KP2 were also tested in immunoelectron microscopy. Rat anti-KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) antibody was kindly provided by Dr. G. Butcher (Cambridge, UK). Rabbit anti-γ-adaptin antibody was a generous gift from Dr. M.

Fluorescein- or Texas red-conjugated goat anti-rat Ig (Sigma) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Corp.) were used. COS-1 cells grown on glass chamber slides (Nunc) were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 27 paraformaldehyde and 0.27 glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 15 min at room temperature to quench unreacted aldehydes. Cells were then blocked in PBS containing 0.57 blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) and 0.27 Triton X-100 (PBS-BT) for 30 min at room temperature. Incubation with primary antibodies (diluted 1:200–1:1000 in PBS-BT) continued for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing cells three times, bound antibodies were detected with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. After two washes in PBS-BT and two washes in PBS, slides were mounted in Citifluor and analyzed with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with UV optics. Images were recorded with a CE200A CCD-camera (Photometrics) at a binning of 4 using Smartcapture (Digital Scientific) and IPlab Spectrum (Signal Analytics) software. Cells were collected in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA at room temperature. During the rest of the procedure, incubations were carried out on ice unless mentioned otherwise. Cells were washed twice with PBS and once with 10 mm HEPES (pH 6.3) containing 5 mm EDTA. Cells were resuspended in 10 mm HEPES (pH 6.3) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 ॖg/ml pepstatin and sheared by passing five times through a 25 gauge needle. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove intact cells and nuclei. The postnuclear supernatant was diluted 2-fold and centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 200,000 × g av in an SW60 rotor (Beckmann). The membrane-containing pellets were drained for 5 min, resuspended in 2 volumes of 100 mm Na2CO3 (pH 11.5; 0 °C), transferred to new tubes, and then extracted in approximately 40 volumes of the same buffer for 30 min (29Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Membranes were centrifuged again at 200,000 × g avfor 30 min. Both the supernatants and carbonate-extracted membrane pellets were immediately neutralized with 100 mm HEPES (pH 6.3; final concentration) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (ECL detection system, Amersham Corp.). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cells were prepared for ultrastructural immunocytochemistry as described (30Griffiths G. Fine Structure Immunocytochemistry. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 1-459Crossref Google Scholar). Immunolabeling of antigens was performed using the protein A-gold technique (31Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Cuello A.C. Immunohistochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1983: 323-346Google Scholar). Sections were immunoreacted with 5 ॖl of primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 57 fetal calf serum and 0.17 bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. The primary antibody utilized in these studies was rabbit polyclonal KP2 (diluted 1:50). Double-labeling was accomplished using the sequential labeling methodology (32Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) by first labeling rabbit anti-LPC antibodies with protein A:10 nm gold and then washing and fixing the complexes with 17 glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Unreacted aldehydes were quenched with 50 mmNH4Cl, and the sections were incubated with rabbit anti-γ-adaptin (diluted 1:50) followed by protein A: 15 nm gold. The sections were observed in a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope. Labeling of cells (8–10 × 105cells/sample) with Tran35Slabel (specific activity, >1000 Ci/mmol, ICN), substrate processing in PK(15) cells, immunoprecipitation, analysis of N-linked glycosylation, and SDS-PAGE have been described (15Creemers J.W.M.

In experiments with brefeldin A (Boehringer Mannheim), CHO cells received 5 ॖg/ml brefeldin A throughout the starvation, labeling, and chase periods. For [3H]palmitic acid labeling, cells were starved for 1 h in minimal essential medium α containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and then labeled for 2 h in the presence of 1 mCi/ml [3H](9,10)-palmitic acid (specific activity, 30–60 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) in minimal essential medium α containing 17 Me2SO and 0.17 bovine serum albumin. Cells were put on ice and washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, followed by lysis in 1 ml of DIPA buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 17 Triton X-100, 17 sodium deoxycholate, 0.17 SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 2 ॖm pepstatin, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 100 units/ml Trasylol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 15,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge and then by incubation of the supernatants with 5 ॖl of rabbit serum bound to 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia). Furin and LPC were immunoprecipitated with 5–10 ॖl of rabbit polyclonal anti-furin and anti-LPC serum, respectively. Samples labeled with [3H]palmitic acid were boiled for 1 min at 95 °C in sample buffer containing 40 mm dithiothreitol. Palmitoylation of LPC was analyzed by treatment with hydroxylamine as follows. Immunoprecipitated LPC from [3H]palmitate labeled cells was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in duplicate. One gel was incubated in 1 m hydroxylamine (pH 7.5) for 2 h. The other gel was incubated in 1 m Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) for 2 h. Gels were then washed twice in distilled water, fixed, and treated for fluorography. To study the biosynthesis of LPC, CHO cell lines were generated that stably expressed wild-type LPC. For comparative evaluation, a CHO cell line expressing recombinant furin was also included in these studies (25Ayoubi T.A.Y. Meulemans S.M.P. Roebroek A.J.M. Van de Ven W.J.M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 23: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After labeling of CHO-LPC cells for 1 h, antibodies KP1 as well as MP1 detected two proteins migrating at approximately 92 and 102 kDa (Fig.1 A). Both proteins are most likely LPC isoforms, as substantiated by similar immunoprecipitation analysis of deletion mutants of LPC (Δcyt and Δtm+cyt) lacking a part of the carboxyl-terminal region of LPC. Such analysis also revealed the biosynthesis of two proteins, and they had a higher electrophoretic mobility in accordance with the deleted sequences (see Fig. 6). When pulse-labeled CHO-LPC cells were subsequently chased for 2 h, one major immunoreactive protein of about 90–92 kDa was detected that now migrated more diffusely, whereas the intensity of the 102-kDa LPC protein had clearly decreased (Fig. 1 A,lanes c). Specificity of the anti-LPC antibodies was demonstrated by concomitant analysis of the parental, nontransfected CHO cell line (Fig. 1 A, lanes -). No LPC proteins were detected in these control experiments. Similar results were obtained with antibodies MP2 and KP2 (data not shown).Figure 6Removal of the putative LPC transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains results in secretion. CHO-DHFR−cells were transiently transfected with 2 ॖg of LPC(wt), LPCΔcyt, or LPCΔtm+cyt cDNA and labeled the following day with 100 ॖCi/ml Tran35Slabel for 1 h (lanes P). Radioactivity was subsequently chased for an additional 4 h (lanes C). Wild-type and mutant LPC were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and from the 4-h chase media (lanes M) with antibody MP1 and analyzed using SDS-PAGE on 7.57 gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Pulse-chase analysis of cells that had been labeled for only 10 min also showed that anti-LPC antibodies immunoprecipitated two proteins of 92 and 102 kDa. They slowly disappeared in time (Fig. 1 B). After a chase period of 40 min, a third protein with a molecular mass of about 90 kDa became visible. It subsequently increased in molecular mass, most likely as a result of further post-translational modifications, until it finally comigrated with the protein of about 92 kDa mentioned above (Fig. 1 B). The 90-kDa protein was never detected in analyses of cells expressing an inactive LPC mutant in which the active site serine of the catalytic triad was mutated (LPCS265A, described below), indicating that the 90-kDa protein corresponds to a processed form of LPC that lacks the propeptide. Comigration of the 92-kDa protein already detectable after pulse labeling and the 92-kDa protein originating from the 90 kDa protein made it impossible to precisely follow the fate of the former. N-Linked glycosylation of LPC was also studied (Fig.2). Treatment of theLPC-encoded proteins with endoglycosidase H and F suggested that the initially synthesized 92-kDa protein is a nonglycosylated LPC proprotein and the 102-kDa protein is an endo-H-sensitive,N-glycosylated isoform of it. These results supported the conclusion that the 92- and 102-kDa proteins, detectable directly after pulse labeling, contain the same polypeptide backbone. This conclusion was further substantiated by analysis of deletion mutants of LPC, one lacking only the carboxyl terminus (LPCΔcyt), the other both the carboxyl terminus and the hydrophobic domain (LPCΔtm+cyt); described below). Also in cells expressing these mutants, two proteins were detected, although with smaller molecular masses in agreement with their deletions. Results obtained with the 90-kDa protein revealed complex N-glycosylation. Studies after various chase times demonstrated that the observed increase in molecular mass of the 90-kDa protein to about 92 kDa was most likely due to additionalN-linked glycosylation (Fig. 2). Moreover, the composition of the N-linked sugars changed during the chase from a high mannose (shown by its sensitivity to endo-H) to a complex type (insensitivity to endo-H), suggesting that this protein represents processed LPC (i.e. its propeptide removed) that is transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum into the Golgi complex. In contrast, the 102-kDa LPC proprotein remained endo-H-sensitive throughout the complete chase period, suggesting that it never left the endoplasmic reticulum. Similar observations were made in studies with the processing-defective LPC mutant LPCS265A (data not shown; see also below, immunofluorescence data in Fig.3). It should also be noted that removal of the LPC prodomain is not inhibited by the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (data not shown). Moreover, brefeldin A reduces the complexN-glycosylation of mature LPC as was concluded from the change in appearance of the immunoprecipitated protein band from a diffuse to a compact band when brefeldin A was added. All these observations are in support of the conclusion that processing of LPC takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum.Figure 3Subcellular localization of LPC proteins.

We have explored the possibility that mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades play a role in mediating the effects of gastrin on transcription in a gastric cancer (AGS-B) cell line. Gastrin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment of AGS-B cells was found to increase the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 and increase ERK activity as determined by thein vitro phosphorylation of myelin basic protein. Reporter gene assays also demonstrated that gastrin and PMA stimulated Elk-1- and c-Myc-dependent transactivation, consistent with gastrin- and PMA-induced activation of ERKs. Overexpression of wild type ERK-1 and ERK-2 or activation of endogenous ERKs using activated MEK-1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase or ERK kinase) overexpression stimulated HDC promoter activity in a dose-dependent fashion. Interruption of the ERK-related pathway using expression vectors for kinase-deficient ERKs or an ERK-specific phosphatase (PAC-1) blocked gastrin- and PMA-stimulated HDC promoter activity. In contrast, inhibition of the Jun kinase pathway using an interfering dominant negative SEK-1 (stress-activated protein kinase/ERK-1) mutant did not inhibit HDC promoter activity. Furthermore, whereas gastrin stimulated phosphorylation of Shc proteins and association with Grb2, activation of the HDC promoter was not influenced by expression of dominant negative Ras (N15 or N17) proteins. However, gastrin stimulated Raf-1 kinase activity, and activation of the HDC promoter was blocked by coexpression of a dominant negative Raf-1 construct. Overall, these data demonstrate that gastrin regulates HDC transcription in a Rafdependent, Ras-independent fashion predominantly through activation of the ERK-related pathway.

Agonist binding to this receptor has been shown to activate a phospholipase C that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, which mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ and activates protein kinase C, respectively (4Seva C.

Cancer. 1994; 56: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whereas CCK-B/gastrin receptors have been detected in both the brain and the pancreas of most mammalian species, the major target of gastrin in the gastrointestinal tract is the enterochromaffin-like cell of the gastric corpus. Gastrin stimulation of enterochromaffin-like cells leads to increased histamine secretion and elevated activity of histidine decarboxylase (HDC). HDC catalyzes the decarboxylation ofl-histidine and thus is the rate-limiting enzyme in the stomach for the generation of histamine, the major gastric acid secretogogue. Studies from a number of groups have now shown that gastrin-stimulated HDC enzymatic activity is paralleled by increased HDC gene expression in the gastric corpus and isolated enterochromaffin-like cells (6Höcker M.

In addition, targeted disruption of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor in mice leads to decreased expression of the HDC gene in the gastric corpus (10Nagata A. Ito M. Iwata N. Kuno J. Takano H. Minowa O.

Kopin A.S. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 280-286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).To study transcriptional regulation of HDC by gastrin, we developed the AGS-B cell line, a human gastric cancer cell line stably expressing the recombinant human CCK-B/gastrin receptor (6Höcker M. Zhang Z. Fenstermacher D.A. Tågerud S. Chulak M.B. Joseph D. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G619-G633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments from our laboratory have shown that the HDC promoter is regulated transcriptionally by gastrin preferentially through a protein kinase C-dependent signaling pathway (6Höcker M. Zhang Z. Fenstermacher D.A. Tågerud S. Chulak M.B. Joseph D. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G619-G633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies from our laboratory have provided evidence that transcriptional stimulation of the HDC gene by gastrin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is mediated by a 23-nucleotide cis-acting element, the gastrin response element (GAS-RE), which is located downstream of the transcriptional start site (12Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Gastrin and PMA treatment of AGS-B cells induces enhanced binding of a nuclear factor to the GAS-RE. In a subsequent study, we found activation of AP-1 to be essential for gastrin-stimulated HDC transcription, although the mechanism is likely indirect (13Höcker M. Zhang Z. Merchant J.M. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 35: 6822-6830Google Scholar).The signal transduction pathways that mediate the activation of specific transcriptional effects by the CCK-B/gastrin receptor have not been defined fully. Although the CCK-B/gastrin receptor has been linked to phospholipase C and activation of protein kinase C (4Seva C. Scemama J.L. Pradayrol L. Sarfati P.D. Vaysse N. Regul. Pept. 1994; 52: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Bertrand V. Bastie M.J. Vaysse N. Pradayrol L. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 56: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the steps downstream of protein kinase C activation are not entirely clear. Because the mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway has been characterized as an important signaling route for the transmission of protein kinase C effects on the activity of the AP-1 complex (14Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MAPK-regulated signaling could represent an important pathway for mediating the transcriptional effects of gastrin. The best studied members of the MAPK family are the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), 42- and 44-kDa serine/threonine kinases encoded by the ERK-2 and ERK-1 genes, respectively (14Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ERKs are activated enzymatically through tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation by their upstream activator kinases MEK (MAPK kinase or ERK kinase) in response to growth-promoting factors acting on a variety of cell surface receptors (15Cobb M. Goldsmith E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Following activation, the ERKs up-regulate the biological activity of a number of downstream targets, including transcription factors such as c-Myc, c-Fos, and p62 TCF, through specific phosphorylation of these factors (14Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other branch of the MAPK family is represented by the JUN kinases (JNKs), which are activated by tumor necrosis factor α and agents that induce cellular stress but can also be activated through signaling by G-protein-coupled receptors.These observations led us to investigate a possible role for the MAPK cascades in mediating the effects of gastrin on activation of the HDC promoter. We find that the ERK pathway is essential for transmission of the gastrin effects on the transcriptional activity of the human HDC promoter and that the CCK-B/gastrin receptors expressed in AGS-B gastric cancer cells are linked through a Ras-independent, Raf-dependent mechanism to ERK signaling cascades.DISCUSSIONOur studies suggest that the ERK-dependent signaling pathways mediate the stimulatory effects of gastrin on the transcription of the HDC gene. Several different lines of evidence are consistent with this conclusion. Overexpression of wild type ERK-1 and ERK-2 induced HDC promoter activity dose-dependently, suggesting a regulatory function for these kinases on the activity of the HDC promoter. A second approach involved expression of a constitutively active form of MEK-1 which would be expected to activate endogenous ERKs in AGS-B cells. Previous studies have shown that the MEK-1 mutant Δ-N3-S218E-S222D results in constitutive activity as well as loss of responsiveness to upstream activators (20Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Thus, although overexpression of WT MEK-1 resulted in a minimal increase in HDC promoter activity, the Δ-N3-S218E-S222D mutant form of MEK-1 was able to increase by severalfold the expression of an HDC reporter gene but showed no response to gastrin or PMA. These data support the concept that activation of the endogenous ERKs is sufficient to stimulation transcription of the HDC gene and that gastrin and PMA regulate the HDC promoter through a MEK-1-dependent signaling route.In addition, we found that gastrin and PMA were able to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK-1 and ERK-2 and kinase activity in gastric cancer (AGS) cells. Previous studies have shown that ERK activity is elevated after stimulation of CCK-B/gastrin receptors in several different cell types (29Taniguchi T. Matsui T. Ito M. Murayama T. Tsukamoto T. Katakami Y. Chiba T. Chihara K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 861-867PubMed Google Scholar, 30Seva C. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Blanchet J.-S. Vaysse N. Pradayrol L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Todisco A. Takeuchi Y. Seva C. Dickinson C.J. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28337-28341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but they did not address the role in activating important downstream targets. We found that activation of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor in AGS-B cells was sufficient to activate ERK-regulated transcription factors such as c-Myc and Elk-1, consistent with an important role for this pathway in the transmission of gastrin-dependent signals into the nucleus. Importantly, we found that expression of kinase-deficient ERKs or the ERK-specific phosphatase PAC-1 which interfere with the ERK cascade blocked completely gastrin- and PMA-induced activation of the HDC gene. Overall, these findings demonstrate that gastrin activates the ERK cascade and that this pathway represents the major signaling route for gastrin-dependent regulation of the HDC promoter.Because we have shown recently that activation of c-jun and AP-1 leads to increased HDC transcription (13Höcker M. Zhang Z. Merchant J.M. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 35: 6822-6830Google Scholar), we also investigated a role for JNK-dependent signaling. The JNKs (JNK-1 and JNK-2) are distant relatives of the MAPKs and were identified initially based on their ability to phosphorylate and activate c-Jun. The murine SEK-1 gene (and the human homologue, MKK4) are upstream kinases that activate JNKs by phosphorylation of the Thr-Pro-Tyr sequence (14Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). JNKs are activated by agents that induce cellular stress, such as UV light and tumor necrosis factor α, although JNKs may also be activated by tyrosine kinase growth factors such as epidermal growth factor in a Ras-dependent manner. Recently, Dabrowskiet al. (32Dabrowski A. Grady T. Logsdon C.D. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5686-5690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have shown that JNKs are activated rapidly in isolated rat pancreatic acini after CCK-A receptor activation.Overall, our studies do not suggest an important role for the JNK pathway in the activation of HDC by gastrin. First, although our studies using the GAL4-c-Jun/GAL4-Luc system indicate that c-Jun phosphorylation and transactivation are increased by gastrin stimulation, we have shown that the activation is most likely secondary to ERK activation rather than to activation of JNK pathways. Second, although our data indicate that activation of JNK (via overexpression of SEK-1) can activate HDC promoter activity, this pathway is clearly distinct from the gastrin pathway. Gastrin stimulation of HDC promoter activity was blocked completely by the kinase-deficient ERK-1 mutant, whereas SEK-1 stimulation of HDC was not blocked by the kinase-deficient ERK-1. The lack of effect of the dominant negative SEK-1 mutant, which blocks JNK activation by extracellular stimuli without interfering with the ERK pathway, on gastrin stimulation of HDC promoter activity also suggests that the JNK pathway is probably not required for the gastrin-stimulated response. Finally, neither gastrin nor PMA appeared to be able to stimulate phosphorylation of JNK in AGS-B cells.Recent studies indicate that G-protein-coupled receptors can activate the ERKs through several different mechanisms (33Post G.R. Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Gi-coupled receptors, such as the thrombin (34LaMorte V.J. Kennedy E.D. Collins L.R. Goldstein D. Harootunian A.T. Brown J.H. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19411-19415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lysophosphatidic acid (35Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), α2-adrenergic (36Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22235-22238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and m2 muscarinic (37Winitz S. Russell M. Qian N.X. Gardner A. Dwyer L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19196-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are similar to tyrosine kinase receptors in that they activate the ERKs through a Ras-dependent pathway. Activation of Gi-coupled receptors leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2, a protein that links growth factor receptors to the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Activation of the ERKs by Gi-coupled receptors is mediated by the G-protein ॆγ subunits and thus can be blocked not only by dominant negative RasN17 but also by coexpression of a ॆγ-binding COOH-terminal peptide derived from ॆARK1 (ॆARK1ct) (38Koch W.J.

However, the signaling pathways coupling Gq-linked receptors to ERK activation are less clear and may involve Ras-independent pathways. For example, stimulation of ERK activity by Gq-coupled receptors such as m1 muscarinic and the α1-adrenergic is insensitive to the Gॆγ-sequestering ॆARK1cf peptide and RasN17 (38Koch W.J. Hawes B.E.

Instead, ERK activation by Gq-coupled receptors occurs predominantly through a Ras-insensitive, protein kinase C-dependent pathway (40van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Raymond J.R. Luttrell L.M. Koch W.J.

The GTP-bound α-subunit of the Gq/11 protein activates phosphoinositide hydrolysis and protein kinase C, which then stimulate ERK activation via a poorly understood mechanism involving the activation of Raf-1 kinase (41Kolch W.

Kowalski-Chauvel A. Blanchet J.-S. Vaysse N. Pradayrol L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,43Duan R.-D. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G401-G408PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies did not address the issue as to whether activation of Ras is important for receptor-dependent cellular functions such as the transcriptional regulation of cell-specific genes. Our results in AGS-B cells demonstrate that CCK-B/gastrin receptor activation leads to Shc tyrosine phosphorylation association with Grb2, suggesting possible activation of the Ras pathway. However, although these assays support the idea that Ras is most likely activated by gastrin, stimulation of HDC promoter activity was unaffected by the RasN17 or RasN15 dominant negative mutants. In contrast, gastrin-stimulated Raf-1 kinase activity and expression of the dominant negative Raf-1 protein blocked completely gastrin-stimulated activity of the HDC promoter. Thus, taken together, our results suggest that in gastric cells, the CCK-B/gastrin receptor is linked through a Ras-independent, Raf-dependent mechanism to ERK-related signaling pathways, which are essential for the regulation of HDC transcriptional activity by this G-protein-coupled receptor.Finally, overexpression of ERK-1/2 appeared to activate the HDC promoter through the previously identified gastrin response element or GAS-RE, a 23-base pair element located downstream of the start site. The mechanism by which gastrin stimulation activates the GAS-RE remains unclear but presumably involves increased binding by a novel nuclear factor (the GAS-RE-binding protein) (12Zhang Z. Höcker M.

Further studies will be required to determine if the GAS-RE-binding protein indeed represents a novel downstream target for the ERK pathway.

Agonist binding to this receptor has been shown to activate a phospholipase C that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, which mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ and activates protein kinase C, respectively (4Seva C.

Cancer. 1994; 56: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whereas CCK-B/gastrin receptors have been detected in both the brain and the pancreas of most mammalian species, the major target of gastrin in the gastrointestinal tract is the enterochromaffin-like cell of the gastric corpus. Gastrin stimulation of enterochromaffin-like cells leads to increased histamine secretion and elevated activity of histidine decarboxylase (HDC). HDC catalyzes the decarboxylation ofl-histidine and thus is the rate-limiting enzyme in the stomach for the generation of histamine, the major gastric acid secretogogue. Studies from a number of groups have now shown that gastrin-stimulated HDC enzymatic activity is paralleled by increased HDC gene expression in the gastric corpus and isolated enterochromaffin-like cells (6Höcker M.

In addition, targeted disruption of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor in mice leads to decreased expression of the HDC gene in the gastric corpus (10Nagata A. Ito M. Iwata N. Kuno J. Takano H. Minowa O.

Kopin A.S. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 280-286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To study transcriptional regulation of HDC by gastrin, we developed the AGS-B cell line, a human gastric cancer cell line stably expressing the recombinant human CCK-B/gastrin receptor (6Höcker M. Zhang Z. Fenstermacher D.A. Tågerud S. Chulak M.B. Joseph D. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G619-G633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments from our laboratory have shown that the HDC promoter is regulated transcriptionally by gastrin preferentially through a protein kinase C-dependent signaling pathway (6Höcker M. Zhang Z. Fenstermacher D.A. Tågerud S. Chulak M.B. Joseph D. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G619-G633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies from our laboratory have provided evidence that transcriptional stimulation of the HDC gene by gastrin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is mediated by a 23-nucleotide cis-acting element, the gastrin response element (GAS-RE), which is located downstream of the transcriptional start site (12Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Gastrin and PMA treatment of AGS-B cells induces enhanced binding of a nuclear factor to the GAS-RE. In a subsequent study, we found activation of AP-1 to be essential for gastrin-stimulated HDC transcription, although the mechanism is likely indirect (13Höcker M. Zhang Z. Merchant J.M. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 35: 6822-6830Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways that mediate the activation of specific transcriptional effects by the CCK-B/gastrin receptor have not been defined fully. Although the CCK-B/gastrin receptor has been linked to phospholipase C and activation of protein kinase C (4Seva C. Scemama J.L. Pradayrol L. Sarfati P.D. Vaysse N. Regul. Pept. 1994; 52: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Bertrand V. Bastie M.J. Vaysse N. Pradayrol L. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 56: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the steps downstream of protein kinase C activation are not entirely clear. Because the mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway has been characterized as an important signaling route for the transmission of protein kinase C effects on the activity of the AP-1 complex (14Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MAPK-regulated signaling could represent an important pathway for mediating the transcriptional effects of gastrin. The best studied members of the MAPK family are the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), 42- and 44-kDa serine/threonine kinases encoded by the ERK-2 and ERK-1 genes, respectively (14Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ERKs are activated enzymatically through tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation by their upstream activator kinases MEK (MAPK kinase or ERK kinase) in response to growth-promoting factors acting on a variety of cell surface receptors (15Cobb M. Goldsmith E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Following activation, the ERKs up-regulate the biological activity of a number of downstream targets, including transcription factors such as c-Myc, c-Fos, and p62 TCF, through specific phosphorylation of these factors (14Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other branch of the MAPK family is represented by the JUN kinases (JNKs), which are activated by tumor necrosis factor α and agents that induce cellular stress but can also be activated through signaling by G-protein-coupled receptors. These observations led us to investigate a possible role for the MAPK cascades in mediating the effects of gastrin on activation of the HDC promoter. We find that the ERK pathway is essential for transmission of the gastrin effects on the transcriptional activity of the human HDC promoter and that the CCK-B/gastrin receptors expressed in AGS-B gastric cancer cells are linked through a Ras-independent, Raf-dependent mechanism to ERK signaling cascades. DISCUSSIONOur studies suggest that the ERK-dependent signaling pathways mediate the stimulatory effects of gastrin on the transcription of the HDC gene. Several different lines of evidence are consistent with this conclusion. Overexpression of wild type ERK-1 and ERK-2 induced HDC promoter activity dose-dependently, suggesting a regulatory function for these kinases on the activity of the HDC promoter. A second approach involved expression of a constitutively active form of MEK-1 which would be expected to activate endogenous ERKs in AGS-B cells. Previous studies have shown that the MEK-1 mutant Δ-N3-S218E-S222D results in constitutive activity as well as loss of responsiveness to upstream activators (20Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Thus, although overexpression of WT MEK-1 resulted in a minimal increase in HDC promoter activity, the Δ-N3-S218E-S222D mutant form of MEK-1 was able to increase by severalfold the expression of an HDC reporter gene but showed no response to gastrin or PMA. These data support the concept that activation of the endogenous ERKs is sufficient to stimulation transcription of the HDC gene and that gastrin and PMA regulate the HDC promoter through a MEK-1-dependent signaling route.In addition, we found that gastrin and PMA were able to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK-1 and ERK-2 and kinase activity in gastric cancer (AGS) cells. Previous studies have shown that ERK activity is elevated after stimulation of CCK-B/gastrin receptors in several different cell types (29Taniguchi T. Matsui T. Ito M. Murayama T. Tsukamoto T. Katakami Y. Chiba T. Chihara K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 861-867PubMed Google Scholar, 30Seva C. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Blanchet J.-S. Vaysse N. Pradayrol L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28337-28341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but they did not address the role in activating important downstream targets. We found that activation of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor in AGS-B cells was sufficient to activate ERK-regulated transcription factors such as c-Myc and Elk-1, consistent with an important role for this pathway in the transmission of gastrin-dependent signals into the nucleus. Importantly, we found that expression of kinase-deficient ERKs or the ERK-specific phosphatase PAC-1 which interfere with the ERK cascade blocked completely gastrin- and PMA-induced activation of the HDC gene. Overall, these findings demonstrate that gastrin activates the ERK cascade and that this pathway represents the major signaling route for gastrin-dependent regulation of the HDC promoter.Because we have shown recently that activation of c-jun and AP-1 leads to increased HDC transcription (13Höcker M. Zhang Z. Merchant J.M. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 35: 6822-6830Google Scholar), we also investigated a role for JNK-dependent signaling. The JNKs (JNK-1 and JNK-2) are distant relatives of the MAPKs and were identified initially based on their ability to phosphorylate and activate c-Jun. The murine SEK-1 gene (and the human homologue, MKK4) are upstream kinases that activate JNKs by phosphorylation of the Thr-Pro-Tyr sequence (14Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). JNKs are activated by agents that induce cellular stress, such as UV light and tumor necrosis factor α, although JNKs may also be activated by tyrosine kinase growth factors such as epidermal growth factor in a Ras-dependent manner. Recently, Dabrowskiet al. (32Dabrowski A. Grady T. Logsdon C.D. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5686-5690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have shown that JNKs are activated rapidly in isolated rat pancreatic acini after CCK-A receptor activation.Overall, our studies do not suggest an important role for the JNK pathway in the activation of HDC by gastrin. First, although our studies using the GAL4-c-Jun/GAL4-Luc system indicate that c-Jun phosphorylation and transactivation are increased by gastrin stimulation, we have shown that the activation is most likely secondary to ERK activation rather than to activation of JNK pathways. Second, although our data indicate that activation of JNK (via overexpression of SEK-1) can activate HDC promoter activity, this pathway is clearly distinct from the gastrin pathway. Gastrin stimulation of HDC promoter activity was blocked completely by the kinase-deficient ERK-1 mutant, whereas SEK-1 stimulation of HDC was not blocked by the kinase-deficient ERK-1. The lack of effect of the dominant negative SEK-1 mutant, which blocks JNK activation by extracellular stimuli without interfering with the ERK pathway, on gastrin stimulation of HDC promoter activity also suggests that the JNK pathway is probably not required for the gastrin-stimulated response. Finally, neither gastrin nor PMA appeared to be able to stimulate phosphorylation of JNK in AGS-B cells.Recent studies indicate that G-protein-coupled receptors can activate the ERKs through several different mechanisms (33Post G.R. Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Gi-coupled receptors, such as the thrombin (34LaMorte V.J. Kennedy E.D. Collins L.R. Goldstein D. Harootunian A.T. Brown J.H. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19411-19415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lysophosphatidic acid (35Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), α2-adrenergic (36Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22235-22238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and m2 muscarinic (37Winitz S. Russell M. Qian N.X. Gardner A. Dwyer L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19196-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are similar to tyrosine kinase receptors in that they activate the ERKs through a Ras-dependent pathway. Activation of Gi-coupled receptors leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2, a protein that links growth factor receptors to the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Activation of the ERKs by Gi-coupled receptors is mediated by the G-protein ॆγ subunits and thus can be blocked not only by dominant negative RasN17 but also by coexpression of a ॆγ-binding COOH-terminal peptide derived from ॆARK1 (ॆARK1ct) (38Koch W.J.

Recent studies indicate that G-protein-coupled receptors can activate the ERKs through several different mechanisms (33Post G.R. Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Gi-coupled receptors, such as the thrombin (34LaMorte V.J. Kennedy E.D. Collins L.R. Goldstein D. Harootunian A.T. Brown J.H. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19411-19415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lysophosphatidic acid (35Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), α2-adrenergic (36Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22235-22238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and m2 muscarinic (37Winitz S. Russell M. Qian N.X. Gardner A. Dwyer L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19196-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are similar to tyrosine kinase receptors in that they activate the ERKs through a Ras-dependent pathway. Activation of Gi-coupled receptors leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2, a protein that links growth factor receptors to the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Activation of the ERKs by Gi-coupled receptors is mediated by the G-protein ॆγ subunits and thus can be blocked not only by dominant negative RasN17 but also by coexpression of a ॆγ-binding COOH-terminal peptide derived from ॆARK1 (ॆARK1ct) (38Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways coupling Gq-linked receptors to ERK activation are less clear and may involve Ras-independent pathways. For example, stimulation of ERK activity by Gq-coupled receptors such as m1 muscarinic and the α1-adrenergic is insensitive to the Gॆγ-sequestering ॆARK1cf peptide and RasN17 (38Koch W.J. Hawes B.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Instead, ERK activation by Gq-coupled receptors occurs predominantly through a Ras-insensitive, protein kinase C-dependent pathway (40van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Raymond J.R. Luttrell L.M. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1266-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound α-subunit of the Gq/11 protein activates phosphoinositide hydrolysis and protein kinase C, which then stimulate ERK activation via a poorly understood mechanism involving the activation of Raf-1 kinase (41Kolch W. Heldecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahldl H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 42Troppmair J. Brudger J.T. Munoz H. Lloyd P.A. Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Avruch J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7030-7035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that the Ras pathway can be activated through agonist stimulation of members of the CCK receptor family (30Seva C. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Blanchet J.-S. Vaysse N. Pradayrol L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,43Duan R.-D. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G401-G408PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies did not address the issue as to whether activation of Ras is important for receptor-dependent cellular functions such as the transcriptional regulation of cell-specific genes. Our results in AGS-B cells demonstrate that CCK-B/gastrin receptor activation leads to Shc tyrosine phosphorylation association with Grb2, suggesting possible activation of the Ras pathway. However, although these assays support the idea that Ras is most likely activated by gastrin, stimulation of HDC promoter activity was unaffected by the RasN17 or RasN15 dominant negative mutants. In contrast, gastrin-stimulated Raf-1 kinase activity and expression of the dominant negative Raf-1 protein blocked completely gastrin-stimulated activity of the HDC promoter. Thus, taken together, our results suggest that in gastric cells, the CCK-B/gastrin receptor is linked through a Ras-independent, Raf-dependent mechanism to ERK-related signaling pathways, which are essential for the regulation of HDC transcriptional activity by this G-protein-coupled receptor. Finally, overexpression of ERK-1/2 appeared to activate the HDC promoter through the previously identified gastrin response element or GAS-RE, a 23-base pair element located downstream of the start site. The mechanism by which gastrin stimulation activates the GAS-RE remains unclear but presumably involves increased binding by a novel nuclear factor (the GAS-RE-binding protein) (12Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).

Here we describe the kinetics of the membrane binding of fluorescent (acrylodan-labeled) peptides measured with a stopped-flow technique.

As expected theoretically,k on is independent of factors that affect the molar partition coefficient, such as the mole fraction of acidic lipid in the vesicle and the salt concentration. The dissociation rate constant (k off) is ∼10 s−1(lifetime = 0.1 s) for vesicles with 107 acidic lipid in 100 mm KCl.

Although the exact function of MARCKS is not known, this peripheral protein binds to calmodulin (2Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

In the plasma membranes of macrophages, MARCKS is concentrated in lateral domains (6Rosen A. Keenan K.F. Thelen M. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. J. Exp.

Ca2+-calmodulin (Ca2+·CaM) binds with high (nanomolar) affinity to the effector region, producing desorption of MARCKS from both phospholipid vesicles and plasma membranes (10Kim J. Shishido T.

Several experiments suggest that a peptide corresponding to the effector region of bovine MARCKS, MARCKS-(151–175), is a good model for studying the membrane binding of this region. First, membrane binding of both the protein and the peptide depends strongly on the mole fraction of acidic lipid in the membrane and the ionic strength of the solution (10Kim J. Shishido T. Jiang X.

Second, CaM binds with high affinity to both the peptide and the effector region of the protein, producing desorption of both molecules from membranes (2Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kim J. Shishido T. Jiang X. Aderem A. McLaughlin S. J. Biol.

Fourth, both MARCKS and MARCKS-(151–175) inhibit the phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). The peptide produces lateral domains enriched in PIP2, but not phospholipase C, which could explain this inhibition (22Glaser M. Wanaski S. Buser C.A. Boguslavsky V. Rashidzada W. Morris A. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S.F. Runnels L.W. Prestwich G.D. Chen J. Aderem A. Ahn J. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26187-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a molecular model of acrylodan-labeled MARCKS-(151–175) bound to a 2:1 phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) membrane; the model is consistent with the available structural data. Circular dichroism studies of MARCKS-(151–175) suggest that the peptide has little defined secondary structure, either in solution or when bound to a membrane (23Coburn C. Eisenberg J. Eisenberg M. McLaughlin S. Runnels L. Biophys. J. 1993; 64 (abstr.): 60Google Scholar, 24Qin Z. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2917-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Association of MARCKS-(151–175) with a lipid monolayer held at a constant area increases the surface pressure, which shows that it penetrates the head group region (22Glaser M. Wanaski S. Buser C.A. Boguslavsky V. Rashidzada W. Morris A. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S.F. Runnels L.W. Prestwich G.D. Chen J. Aderem A. Ahn J. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26187-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). More detailed EPR studies indicate that membrane-bound MARCKS-(151–175) is in an extended conformation (24Qin Z. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2917-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar): the 5 phenylalanine residues penetrate the polar head group region, whereas the first 6 amino acids, which are positively charged, remain outside this region. In Fig. 1, we show acrylodan attached to a cysteine-substituted residue at the N terminus of the peptide; we used this peptide for our kinetic studies. A blue shift in the fluorescence of this polarity-sensitive probe (26Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7541-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) occurs when the labeled peptide binds to membranes (19Kim J. Blackshear P.J. Johnson J.D. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 227-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), suggesting that the fluorophore inserts into the membrane as indicated in Fig. 1. This study addresses three questions. First, how fast does MARCKS-(151–175) bind to phospholipid vesicles? Second, what is its lifetime on the vesicle? Third, how rapidly can Ca2+-calmodulin release MARCKS-(151–175) from the membrane? 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (PC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine (PS), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylglycerol (PG), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-egg phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE), 1-acyl-2-[12[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (NBD-PG), and 1-oleoyl-2-[12[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-[phospho-l-serine] (NBD-PS) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Radiolabeled 1,2-di[1-14C] oleoyl-l-3-phosphatidylcholine ([14C]PC) was purchased from Amersham Corp., and 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (acrylodan) from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). K151C-MARCKS-(151–175) has the sequence acrylodan-CKKKKRFSFKKSFLKSGFSFKKNKK-amide and was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany; purity > 967). The standard buffer contained 100 mm KCl and 1 mmMOPS, pH 7; buffers with 200 mm KCl were used in some experiments. Bovine brain calmodulin (high purity) was purchased from Calbiochem, and hog brain calmodulin was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. F160C-MARCKS-(151–175), a peptide corresponding to the basic effector region of bovine MARCKS with the ninth phenylalanine changed to cysteine (acetyl-KKKKKRFSCKKSFKLSGFSFKKNKK-amide) and this cysteine labeled with acrylodan, was synthesized on a Gilson Multiple Peptide system (AMS 422) using a Rink amide p-methylbenzhydrylamine resin and Fmoc chemistry. N-terminal acetylation of the resin-bound peptide was carried out using acetic anhydride and diisopropylethylamine. The peptide was cleaved by reacting the resin with trifluoroacetic acid/ethanedithiol/thioanisole/anisole/water (89:3:3:2:3) for 6 h. The resulting peptide solution was filtered, precipitated in cold ether, dried, and reacted with 1.2 eq of acrylodan in dimethylformamide for 12 h; the reaction mixture was then quenched with water and lyophilized. The lyophilized mixture was dissolved in water, applied to a reverse-phase C18 high pressure liquid chromatography column, and eluted with a 10–457 gradient of acetonitrile in water using a flow rate of 3 ml/min; the pure labeled peptide eluted in 26–27 min. The purified peptides were examined using electrospray/ionization mass spectrometry and yielded m/zvalues of 3304, consistent with the expected molecular mass for the derivatized peptide. C-K7 (acrylodan-CKKKKKKK-amide) was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Model 431A peptide synthesizer using Fmoc chemistry at the Center for Analysis and Synthesis of Macromolecules, State University of New York (Stony Brook, NY). Cleavage of C-K7 from the resin, purification, and labeling with acrylodan were performed as described above for F160C-MARCKS-(151–175). The initial concentration of lipids in chloroform was measured on a Cahn electrobalance, a method that gives the same results as phosphate analysis (27Kim J. Mosior M. Chung L.A. Wu H. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 135-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Trace amounts of [14C]PC were added to the lipid mixture to determine the final lipid concentration. Lipid mixtures were dried on a rotary evaporator and resuspended in the standard buffer to obtain multilamellar vesicles. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were made by extruding multilamellar vesicles 10 times through a stack of two polycarbonate filters (100-, 400-, or 600-nm pore diameter) after five freeze-thaw cycles (28Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). LUV100 (produced using 100-nm pore filters) are unilamellar and have a well defined size distribution, with an average diameter of 100 ± 5 nm (28Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim.

LUV400 and LUV600 preparations include both unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles with broader size distributions: LUV400 produced at 50–100 p.s.i. extrusion pressure have average diameters of 200 ± 20 nm; LUV600 have a complex bimodal size distribution, with diameters of ∼100–200 and 400 nm (30Koelchens S.

J. 1993; 64: 426-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Unless specified, preparations and measurements were done at room temperature (22–23 °C). We consider the association of the peptide (P) with the vesicle (V) to form PV. In the simplest case, partitioning occurs in a single step with a second-order association rate constant (k on) and a first-order dissociation rate constant (k off) (Equation 1), P+V⇌koffkonPV;d[PV]/dt=kon[V][P]−koff[PV]Equation 1 where [P] is the concentration of free peptide in the aqueous phase. When the concentration of lipid is much higher than the concentration of peptide, partitioning of the peptide onto the vesicles does not affect the overall affinity of the vesicles for the peptide, [V] is a constant, and association is a pseudo first-order process. Under these conditions, the solution to Equation 1 is as follows (Equation 2), [PV]=[PV]∞×(1−e−t/τ)Equation 2 where [PV]∞ is the concentration of peptide partitioned onto the vesicles at equilibrium and τ is the relaxation time of the process. The reciprocal of the relaxation time (1/τ) is as follows (Equation 3). 1/τ=kon[V]+koffEquation 3 We plot experimental data as 1/τ versus either [V] or [L], where [L] is the concentration of accessible lipid,i.e. the lipid in the outer leaflet of the vesicles. We assume that the accessible lipid concentration is half the total lipid concentration. The association rate constant (k on) can be obtained from the slope of 1/τversus [L], which equals k on/ν, where ν is the number of lipid molecules composing the outer leaflet of the vesicle. ν = 4πR V2/A L, where R V is the radius of a vesicle andA L = 0.7 nm2 is the area/lipid molecule (32McIntosh T.J. Simon S.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4058-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The diffusion-limited association rate constant (k diff) is the highest possible value fork on. For a peptide partitioning onto a vesicle,k diff = 4πN A (R V +R P)(D V +D P), where N A is Avogadro's number, R V +R P is the sum of the radii of the vesicle and the peptide, and D V + D Pis the sum of diffusion coefficients of the vesicle and the peptide (33Noyes R.M. Prog. React. Kinet. 1961; 1: 129-160Google Scholar, 34Berg H.C. Random Walks in Biology. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1983: 17-27Google Scholar, 35Schwarz G. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 26: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The vesicle is much larger than the peptide (R V + R P ≈R V), and the diffusion coefficient of the vesicle is much lower than that of the peptide (D V + D P ≈D P); hence, Equation 4 follows. kdiff=4πNARVDPEquation 4 Kinetic measurements were performed on an SLM-AMINCO spectrofluorometer with a stopped-flow attachment (Milliflow SLM-AMINCO, Rochester, NY). The dead time was 2–4 ms as determined by measuring the reaction of pyranine (Molecular Probes, Inc.) with bovine carbonic anhydrase (Sigma) as described by the manufacturer. Acrylodan fluorescence was monitored at 455–460 nm with excitation at 362–370 nm and slit widths of 4–8 nm. All solutions were degassed. In a typical experiment, 100 nm peptide in buffer was mixed rapidly with the vesicle solution in a stopped-flow chamber (volume = 32 ॖl). An average of at least 10 shots was fit with a single exponent (least squares method). The quality of the fit was checked by examining the residuals between the data points and the fit. We determined the dissociation rate constant (k off) in three ways: as the y axis intercept of a plot of 1/τversus [V] (Equation 3), from the kinetics of peptide transfer from donor to acceptor vesicles (see below), and as the ratio of the association rate constant and the molar partition coefficient (see Equation 7). In the second approach, we mixed acceptor vesicles (V*) with a solution containing peptide adsorbed to donor vesicles (PV). We describe the redistribution of the peptide from donor to acceptor vesicles using Equation 5, PV+V*⇌konkoffP+V+V*⇌k*offk*onPV*+VEquation 5 where k*on andk*off are the association and dissociation rate constants for the peptide binding to acceptor vesicles, respectively. As discussed elsewhere (36Kuzelova K. Brault D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9447-9459Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the relaxation time of the transfer process (τtr) is dominated by k offif three conditions are met: k*on[V*] ≫ k on[V], k*off≪ k off, andk*on[V*] ≫ k off. The first condition is met because [V*] ≫ [V] andk*on ≈ k on; the second condition is met because the acceptor vesicles have a higher mole percent acidic lipid, which increases the affinity of the peptide for V* compared with V; and the third condition is met because the peptide binds strongly to the vesicles (k off < 100 s−1) and association is rapid (we used an excess of the acceptor vesicles, k*on[V*] > 1000 s−1). Under these conditions, Equation 6 follows. koff=1/τtrEquation 6 We measured the transfer of the peptide from donor to acceptor vesicles by resonance energy transfer assay. The acrylodan label on the peptide (excitation at 370 nm) fluoresces at 520 nm in buffer and at 460 nm when bound to membranes; the NBD label on the lipid (excitation at 460 nm) emits at 540 nm. Thus, acrylodan-labeled MARCKS-(151–175) produces little fluorescence at 460 nm if it is either free in solution or bound to a membrane containing NBD-labeled lipid. In a typical experiment, one syringe contained peptide premixed with donor vesicles under conditions where most of the peptide was bound; the other syringe contained an excess of acceptor vesicles containing a high mole percent acidic lipid (usually 1:1 PC/PS; molar partition coefficient of peptide onto these vesicles of K > 107m−1 (19Kim J. Blackshear P.J. Johnson J.D. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 227-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)). Either donor or acceptor vesicles contained 1 mol 7 NBD-labeled PE, PS, or PG to quench acrylodan fluorescence. We obtained τtr from a single exponential fit of the acrylodan fluorescence as a function of time. The relaxation time was independent of vesicle concentration when the ratio of acceptor to donor vesicles was >8, indicating that the three conditions are met and peptide transfer occurs through the aqueous phase. We obtained our third independent estimate of the dissociation rate constant (k off) using the measured values ofk on/ν and the molar partition coefficient (K) (Equation 7). koff=kon/(νK)Equation 7 The molar partition coefficient is the reciprocal of [L] that binds 507 of the peptide. The determination of K is described in 舠Appendix 舡 and elsewhere (19Kim J. Blackshear P.J. Johnson J.D. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 227-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 37Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). We also used resonance energy transfer to measure the transfer of acrylodan-labeled MARCKS-(151–175) from vesicles to Ca2+·CaM. One syringe contained peptide bound to vesicles containing 1 mol 7 NBD-labeled PS or PG to quench the acrylodan fluorescence of the peptide. The other syringe contained Ca2+·CaM in 100 mm KCl and 1 mmMOPS, pH 7, and 50 or 100 ॖm CaCl2. We mixed the contents of the two syringes and monitored the increase in acrylodan fluorescence that occurred when peptides moved from vesicles to calmodulin (excitation at 370 nm and emission at 460 nm). We designed the experiments so that initially, most of the peptide was bound to vesicles, and after mixing with Ca2+·CaM, most of the peptide was bound to Ca2+-calmodulin. Control experiments showed that the relaxation time for MARCKS-(151–175) transfer from the membrane to CaM (τCaM) was independent of both lipid concentration (for example, 50–200 ॖm 5:1 PC/PS vesicles) and Ca2+ concentration (20–200 ॖm added CaCl2). Adding the same concentration of CaCl2 without calmodulin to the peptide/vesicle mixture did not change the acrylodan fluorescence. The kinetics of peptide transfer to Ca2+·CaM did not depend strongly on the peptide concentration in the range of 20–200 nm. Most experiments were done using bovine calmodulin from Calbiochem. We repeated several experiments using porcine CaM from Boehringer Mannheim and obtained qualitatively similar results. We measured the kinetics of peptide partitioning onto vesicles by rapidly mixing the acrylodan-labeled peptide K151C- or F160C-MARCKS-(151–175) with phospholipid vesicles in a stopped-flow chamber. Fig.2 A shows measurements on samples containing 100 nm peptide and four different concentrations of 5:1 PC/PS vesicles. The data illustrate three points. First, the acrylodan fluorescence increases when the peptide associates with vesicles. The steady-state fluorescence values correlate with the fraction of F160C-MARCKS-(151–175) bound to membrane: in the experiment illustrated by curve a, ∼307 of the peptide was bound to vesicles ([L] = 1.2 ॖm), whereas incurve d, ∼907 of F160C-MARCKS-(151–175) was bound to vesicles ([L] = 25 ॖm). Second, the increase in fluorescence over time can be described well by a single exponential function (Equation 2); the solid curves are the best single exponential fits. Third, the relaxation time (τ), determined from the single exponential fit, decreases as the lipid concentration increases. As discussed in 舠Appendix ,舡 the relaxation time was independent of the peptide concentration in all the experiments presented in Figs.2, 3, 4, 5.Figure 3Value of k on depends on the radius of the vesicle.

https://openalex.org/W2053179599,"Neurocan is a member of the aggrecan family of proteoglycans which are characterized by NH2-terminal domains binding hyaluronan, and COOH-terminal domains containing C-type lectin-like modules. To detect and enhance the affinity for complementary ligands of neurocan, the COOH-terminal neurocan domain was fused with the NH2-terminal region of tenascin-C, which contains the hexamerization domain of this extracellular matrix glycoprotein. The fusion protein was designed to contain the last downstream glycosaminoglycan attachment site and was expressed as a proteoglycan. In ligand overlay blots carried out with brain extracts, it recognized tenascin-C. The interaction was abolished by the addition of EDTA, or TNfn4,5, a bacterially expressed tenascin-C fragment comprising the fourth and fifth fibronectin type III module. The fusion protein directly reacted with this fragment in ligand blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedures. Both tenascin-C and TNfn4,5 were retained on Sepharose 4B-linked carboxyl-terminal neurocan domains, which in BIAcore binding studies yielded aK D value of 17 nm for purified tenascin-C. We conclude that a divalent cation-dependent interaction between the COOH-terminal domain of neurocan and those fibronectin type III repeats is substantially involved in the binding of neurocan to tenascin-C.

Increasing evidence suggests that the formation of central nervous system structures is, at least in part, regulated by specific interactions of neural cells with their neighbors and the pericellular microenvironment. Both adhesive and inhibitory interactions seem to be of importance, and various gene families have been implicated in these events (1Goodman C.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 341-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In this context, an increasing number of extracellular matrix glycoproteins and proteoglycans has been described which seem involved in the control of neuron migration and axon growth and guidance (2Lander A.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 3Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Experientia. 1993; 49: 429-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 4Letourneau P.C. Condic M.L. Snow D.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 915-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Faissner A. Steindler D. GLIA. 1995; 13: 233-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Among these, neurocan has been identified as a member of the aggrecan family of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (6Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14785-14801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rauch U. Karthikeyan L. Maurel P. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19536-19547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The constituents of this family are characterized by an NH2-terminal globular hyaluronan-binding domain and a COOH-terminal globular domain with a C-type lectin-like motif. They differ, however, considerably in their central regions (8Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Aggrecan, a large proteoglycan primarily expressed in cartilage forms large aggregates with hyaluronan through its NH2-terminal region. This interaction is stabilized by link protein, which is homologous to the NH2-terminal aggrecan domain and induces a dense association of the proteoglycan along the hyaluronan strands (9Mörgelin M. Heinegard D. Engel J. Paulson M. Biophys. Chem. 1994; 50: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The copurification of link protein with neurocan (6Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A.

Neurosci. 1993; 13: 195-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that lamp-brush-like aggregates, comparable to those which have been observed in cartilage, might also be formed in the central nervous system. Neurocan was found to interact with cell adhesion molecules of the Ig superfamily such as L1 and N-CAM and to modify their binding properties (13Grumet M. Flaccus A. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14Friedlander D.R. Milev P. Karthikeyan L. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neurocan might be involved in the organization of the extracellular environment by interaction with the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C, which is up-regulated during neural development and influences both neuronal and glial cell behavior in various ways (15Grumet M. Milev P. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Bourdon M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12142-12146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Faissner A. Götz B. Joester A.

Neurosci. 1996; 8: 347-356Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan/proteoglycan aggregates would appear as macromolecular structures with multiple COOH-terminal domains exposed at their surface. Structures with multimerized C-type lectin domains can actually be found quite frequently, probably to potentiate the weak adhesive forces of singular domains (for review, see Ref. 18Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Therefore, attempts to identify potential ligands by biochemical approaches should rely on the combination of more than one lectin-type domain in detection probes. For example, IgG-Fc fusion proteins containing dimers of the NH2-terminal extracellular domains of selectins have proven useful for the isolation of complementary ligands (19Watson S.R. Imai Y. Fennie C. Geoffroy J.S. Rosen S.D. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2221-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Levinovitz A. Mühlhoff J. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These NH2-terminal domains are composed of the same motifs as those contained in the COOH-terminal sequence typical for the aggrecan family, although in a different arrangement. In a recent study, an IgG-Fc fusion protein encompassing the complete COOH-terminal homology domain of PG-M/versican was used to detect proteins co-migrating with the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-R in overlay blots (21Aspberg A. Binkert C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10590-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domains of PG-M/versican and neurocan display analogous structures composed of two EGF 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FNIII, fibronectin type III; BSA, bovine serum albumin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TNfn4,5, a bacterially expressed tenascin-C fragment comprising the fourth and fifth fibronectin type III module; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. -like, one lectin-like, and one complement regulatory-like (or sushi-) motif (7Rauch U. Karthikeyan L. Maurel P. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19536-19547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Despite this overall resemblance, two potentially significant differences between these molecules can be observed. Neurocan exhibits a functional glycosaminoglycan attachment site closely preceding the first EGF-like domain by a few amino acids (7Rauch U. Karthikeyan L. Maurel P. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19536-19547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Retzler C. Wiedemann H. Kulbe G. Rauch U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17107-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas all known versican isoforms lack such an attachment motif at this place. Furthermore, neurocan contains two additional cysteines, one in the second EGF motif and one as the COOH-terminal amino acid, which might facilitate a COOH-terminal loop structure. Because it is not possible to conserve the latter structural feature, which is unique for neurocan among the proteoglycans of the aggrecan family, in conventional Ig-Fc fusion proteins, a different strategy of multimerization was developed. Taking advantage of the hexameric structure of tenascin-C under native conditions (24Erickson H.P. Bourdon M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 71-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), multimers of COOH-terminal neurocan parts were generated by fusing the corresponding sequence of the neurocan with the NH2-terminal sequence oftenascin-C. The resulting fusion proteoglycan was named TENCAN and used as a tool to uncover specific ligands. We show here that TENCAN prominently interacts with the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C and map mutual binding regions to the carboxyl terminus of neurocan and distinct domains of the glycoprotein, namely to the fibronectin type III repeats 4 and 5 (TNfn4,5) of tenascin-C.

For the incubation with TENCAN at 4 °C overnight, mixtures of blocking buffer and TENCAN-containing 293 cell supernatant replenished with at least 507 (w/v) blocking buffer were used. All washes, generally three after each incubation, were performed with TBSTCM buffer. Incubations with the monoclonal anti-tenascin-C J1/tn3 and the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rat antibodies were carried out in blocking buffer. Blots were finally developed in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm MgCl2containing 4.5 ॖl of nitro blue tetrazolium and 3.5 ॖl of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate/ml. Blotting of proteins for NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing was carried out in CAPS buffer as described (7Rauch U. Karthikeyan L. Maurel P. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19536-19547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing was carried out with an ABI sequencer model 492 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The COOH-terminal neurocan fragment T950 or BSA were separately coupled to about 2 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose each according to the manufacturer's protocol. The supernatants of the 293 cells transfected with the TN200 and TN250 constructs, whether analyzed separately or combined, were mixed with an equal volume of TBSCM buffer before incubation with the affinity matrix. Aliquots of the supernatants were supplemented with 0.17 Triton X-100 and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (107 w/v). After washing the matrices with TBSCM, the bound proteins were eluted with TBS containing 20 mm EDTA and 1 m NaCl. Aliquots of the first two 3-ml fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid as described above. Samples of each fraction were separated on a 7.57 SDS-PAGE gel, blotted on nitrocellulose, incubated with J1/tn3, and developed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, as described above. The same affinity columns were used for binding studies with the bacterially expressed tenascin-C peptides. In general, 75 ॖg of these tenascin-C fragments were incubated overnight with 2 ml of affinity matrix in a total volume of 4 ml of TBSTCM. The slurry was transferred to a column and the resin was washed with 5 volumes of TBSTCM (fractions 2–6), 3 volumes of TBSTCM with 25 mm EDTA (fractions 7–9), and 3 volumes of TBSTCM containing 25 mm EDTA and 1 m NaCl (fractions 10–12). 500-ॖl aliquots were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, separated on a 127 SDS-PAGE, and stained in the gel with Coomassie Blue. In one experiment (Fig. 10 G), the fragments were incubated overnight with 2 ml of T950-Sepharose in TBSTCM containing 25 mm EDTA, washed with 8 volumes of the same buffer and 3 volumes of TBSTCM containing 25 mm EDTA and 1 mNaCl. 2.5 ॖg of recombinant TN-C domains were separated on a reducing 17.57 SDS gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BAB5, Schleicher and Schüll, Dassel, Germany) by semidry blotting. TBSTCM buffer was used as basic buffer for all solutions. Unspecific binding sites on the membrane were blocked for 90 min at room temperature with 17 (w/v) blocking solution (Boehringer Mannheim, Federal Republic of Germany) in TBSTCM, and the filters were incubated overnight at 4 °C with TENCAN (diluted 1:2 in blocking buffer). Unbound TENCAN was removed with three TBSTCM washing steps of 10 min each. Binding of TENCAN to recombinant TN-C domains was detected with the mAb J1/tn3, peroxidase-derivatized goat anti-rat antibodies and ECL reagent. To assess the role of divalent cations, incubation was carried out in TBST (TBSTCM without divalent cations), including 20 mm EDTA, which served as basic buffer through all steps of the procedure. For the solid phase ELISA, polyvinylchloride plates were coated with recombinant TN-C domains (1 ॖg/ml in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.0, 100 ॖl/well) overnight at 4 °C, washed 3 times with NaHCO3, and blocked with 37 (w/v) BSA in TBSTCM for 1.5 h at 37 °C. 100 ॖl of TENCAN (1:2 diluted in blocking buffer) were added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After three washing steps with TBSTCM, bound TENCAN was detected with J1/tn3 and horseradish peroxidase-derivatized secondary antibodies. Color reaction was developed with ABTS®. The BIAcore system (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) has been described in detail (35Jönsson U. Fägerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Löfas S. Persson B. Roos H. Rönnberg I. Sjölander S. Sternberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Östlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were performed and affinities were calculated in essentially the same way as described earlier (36Retzler C. Göhring W. Rauch U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27304-27310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), in part, with the identical covalently immobilized ligands. Mouse tenascin-C monomers consist of a NH2-terminal heptad/cross-linking domain, followed by 14½ EGF-like repeats, 8–13 FNIII repeats, and a COOH-terminal fibrinogen-like globule (32Weller A. Beck S. Ekblom P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Specific functions in cell recognition and adhesion to other molecules have been mainly attributed to FNIII repeats and the COOH-terminal knob (16Faissner A. Götz B. Joester A. Scholze A. Semin. Dev. Biol. 1995; 6: 139-148Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33Götz B. Scholze A. Clement A. Joester A. Schütte K. Wigger F. Frank R. Spiess E. Ekblom P. Faissner A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 681-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the fusion protein all but the first of these repeats and the COOH-terminal knob were removed and substituted by the COOH-terminal part of neurocan. The remaining first FNIII repeat and the EGF-like repeats were expected to maintain a sufficient degree of flexibility for the fused neurocan domains to interact with multiple ligands (Fig. 1). The segment of the neurocan sequence incorporated into the fusion protein (fragment D925) had previously been expressed in eucaryotic cells where it was modified with chondroitin sulfate chains (23Retzler C. Wiedemann H. Kulbe G. Rauch U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17107-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The analysis of the proteins precipitated from the supernatants of cells transfected with the fusion construct also revealed that the major fraction of the resulting proteins was derivatized with chondroitin sulfate (not shown). To emphasize this proteoglycan characteristic, the fusion protein was named TENCAN. Protein fractions obtained from postnatal rat brain were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted on nitrocellulose, and incubated with the conditioned supernatant of 293 cells secreting TENCAN. For the detection of TENCAN molecules bound to blotted proteins, the monoclonal rat anti-mouse tenascin-C antibody J1/tn3, which recognizes an epitope in the EGF-like repeat region of mouse tenascin-C, was used. This mAb, which did not recognize rat tenascin-C, was expected to interfere only marginally with the ability of the neurocan-derived part of TENCAN to interact with potential ligands. The supernatant of untransfected 293 cells did not yield specific signals in these blotting experiments (Fig.2). In contrast, the supernatant of 293 cells transfected with the short splice variant of tenascin-C (TN200) revealed a different pattern of rat brain proteins than the supernatant of 293 cells transfected with TENCAN (Fig.3). Thus, TN200 containing supernatant did not only serve as a control supernatant, but also as a specific detection aid for potential ligands of tenascin-C. The 250 and 750 mm NaCl fractions of rat central nervous system proteins which were used in this study were prepared by extracting the supernatant of detergent-free brain homogenates with DEAE-Sephacel in TBS (containing 150 mm NaCl), and eluting the ion exchange resin with salt concentrations of 250 and 750 mm NaCl, respectively. Subsequently, the 750 mm NaCl fraction was depleted of intrinsic neurocan by 1D1-affinity chromatography. After SDS-PAGE of these protein fractions under reducing conditions and blotting onto nitrocellulose, TENCAN was recognized in both fractions proteins with an apparent molecular mass of about 250 kDa (Fig. 3,C and D). In the 250 mm NaCl fraction, a protein band at about 160 kDa was revealed in addition to the 250-kDa component (Fig. 3, D). In the 750 mmfraction, a diffuse band at about 190 kDa could be detected only after chondroitinase treatment, whereas both samples displayed minor components of 80 and 100 kDa (Fig. 3, C). The 100-kDa protein was also weakly detectable in the 250 mm fraction. Amido Black staining revealed that this protein represented one of the major constituents of the 750 mm NaCl fraction which contained few distinct proteins. Thus, by transfer of this fraction to a polyvinyldifluoride membrane it was possible to determine the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the 100-kDa protein without further purification. The obtained sequence VKLAKAGKTHGE(S)KKMAP identified the 100-kDa band as nucleolin (37Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar).Figure 3Overlay blot with TENCAN, TN200, and anti-tenascin-C antiserum. Samples of the 750 mm NaCl DEAE fraction of soluble rat brain proteins (A, C, andE) either treated (+) or not treated (−) with chondroitinase (Ch'se), and the 250 mm NaCl DEAE fraction (B, D, and F) were separated on a 57 SDS-PAGE, blotted, and incubated with TN200 supernatant (A and B), TENCAN supernatant (C andD), or anti-tenascin-C antiserum (E andF).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The most likely candidate molecule for the material detected at about 250 kDa, the upper part of which appeared to be sensitive to chondroitinase ABC treatment, was tenascin-C. This hexameric glycoprotein has been shown to be a ligand of neurocan and a component of soluble postnatal rat brain proteoglycan fractions (15Grumet M. Milev P. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Bourdon M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12142-12146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has previously been observed in chicken (38Hoffman S. Crossin K.L. Edelman G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and also in rat brain (15Grumet M. Milev P. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Bourdon M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12142-12146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that subfractions of tenascin-C might be modified by the attachment of chondroitin sulfate chains. Thus, an analogous set of protein samples (Fig. 3, E and F) was developed with polyclonal tenascin-C antibodies, which do not show any reactivity in Western blots with tissue samples of tenascin-C knock-out mice (29Forsberg E. Hirsch E. Fröhlich L. Meyer M. Ekblom P. Aszodi A. Werner S. Fässler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6594-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This serum reacted strongest with bands that comigrated with those recognized by TENCAN at about 250 kDa, indicating that these indeed represent rat tenascin-C. The supernatant of 293 cells transfected with TN200 revealed a distinct set of bands. Material at 350–400 kDa was detected in the 750 mm NaCl eluate upon treatment of this fraction with chondroitinase ABC and absent under control conditions, indicating that binding occurred to a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core protein (Fig. 3, A). Tenascin-C binds via its COOH-terminal fibrinogen-like domain to oligosaccharide structuresN-linked to phosphacan (39Milev P. Meyer-Puttlitz B. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24650-24653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 40Milev P. Fischer D. Häring M. Schulthess T. Margolis R.K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15501-15509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Since phosphacan is a major component of the rat brain proteoglycan fraction (6Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14785-14801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the core protein of this proteoglycan appears to be the most likely candidate molecule for the 400-kDa band. The major bands recognized by TN200 in the 250 mm NaCl fraction were visible at 220, 135, and 115 kDa (Fig. 3, B). To evaluate whether proteins in the 250 mmNaCl fraction identified by TENCAN or TN200 might represent fibronectin, tenascin-R, or fibulin-2, analogous protein samples were electrophoresed, blotted in parallel, and probed with the respective antisera (Fig. 4 A). The result of the Western blot renders it likely that the 220-kDa band recognized by TN200 represents fibronectin. The polyclonal anti-tenascin-R antibodies resulted in very slowly developing signals and, for this reason, the 250 mm NaCl fraction was probed with a mixture of two mAbs to tenascin-R in a separate experiment. These antibodies reacted with protein bands corresponding to the material migrating at around 180 kDa and faintly stained with the antiserum, but not with the more prominent 160-kDa component also recognized by TENCAN (results not shown). When purified chicken tenascin-R was transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with TENCAN, only a very faint staining was apparent (Fig. 4 B). In addition to its consistently observed interaction with the 250-kDa band, in a particular rat brain protein sample TENCAN clearly recognized also a 200-kDa component, presumably a tenascin-C isoform which lacks the alternatively spliced FNIII"

Our recent studies indicate that in addition to being a transcriptional activator, HSF1 functions as a repressor of a number of genes including IL1B (8Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-27879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that at elevated temperatures HSF1 possesses both activation and suppression functions, depending on the nature of the target promoter (1Voellmy R. Crit. Rev.

The function of the heat shock response in mammals is somewhat mysterious considering the tight regulation of body temperature in homeotherms. However, the response may have become adapted to function during fever, the neuroendocrine response to disease that modulates elevation in body temperature (9Kruger M.J. Kozac W. Conn C.A. Leon L.R. Sosynski D. Infect. Dis. North Am. 1996; 10: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Because one function of interleukin 1ॆ, the product of the IL1B gene and a target for HSF1 repression is the mediation of fever, HSF1 could function as a feedback inhibitor of ILIB during fever (8Cahill C.M.

We are interested to know whether HSF1 affects other genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and viral infection that might be involved in the heat shock response and the mediation of fever. One such gene is c-fos, an early response gene involved in regulating normal cellular proliferation and differentiation as well as being expressed in many types of tumors (10Holt J.T. Gopal V.

Ras, which serves as a signal transducer in a manner similar to other signal GTP-binding proteins, transmits signals from the plasma membrane to nuclear targets such as the transcription factors mentioned above (18Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). We have therefore examined the effect of HSF1 on the expression of the c-fos gene and the activity of the c-fos promoter in mitogen and Ras-stimulated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO K1) fibroblasts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHuman HSP70B promoter construct p2500CAT was purchased from StressGen (Victoria, BC, Canada), and the humanHSP27 promoter was a gift from Drs.

For pfos 396, a fragment of the c-fos promoter was deleted from −2000 to −396. pfos 396D219-81 was derived from pfos 396 by deletion from −219 to −81, which increases promoter activity (18Kaziro Y.

Human HSF2A cDNA 2J. Marsh and S. K. Calderwood, manuscript in preparation. was inserted into the pcDNA3.1(+) EcoRI and XhoI sites to produce pHSF2A. Then the fragment from pstI to VspI sites of pSV-ॆ-Galactosidase plasmid, containing SV40 early promoter and enhancer segments, lacZ coding region and SV40 poly(A) signals, was inserted into the pHSF plasmids atNsiI and SapI sites to replace the Neomycin resistance gene, and these constructs were termed p-B-HSF1 and p-B-HSF2, respectively. pHSF1mut was derived from p-B-HSF1 by digesting HSF1 with the PflMI, blunting with Klenow, and religating. A leucine was thus inserted into HSF1 at position 22 to mutate the N-terminal DNA binding domain. p-B-control plasmid was derived from p-B-HSF1 by deleting HSF1 at the XhoI and EcoRI sites. After blunting with Klenow, the resulting fragment was religated. Constructs were confirmed by sequencing with a T7 kit (Amersham).

Luciferase activity was normalized to ॆ-galactosidase activity, which was used as an internal transfection efficiency control. Results are expressed as fold activity of control. Analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple range test was employed for statistical analysis of luciferase values.Stable TransfectionAfter transfection, cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing 107 FCS for 24 h. Neomycin (G418) was added to 300 ng/ml until surviving cells reached confluence. Surviving clones were then selected and amplified.EMSANuclear extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al.

However c-fos repression did not require the binding of HSF1 to the c-fos promoter because a HSF1 construct deficient in HSE binding activity and transcriptional activating function still repressed the c-fos promoter and no evidence was obtained for HSF1 binding to the promoter (Fig. 2). The mechanisms of c-fos repression by HSF1 thus contrast with those underlying transcriptional activation, which are dependent on HSF1 binding to HSE sequences within hsp promoters (1Voellmy R. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 357-401PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repression can involve a number of contrasting mechanisms (30Sakai D.D. Helms S. Carlstedt-Duke C. Gustafson J.-A. Rottman F.M. Yamamoto K. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1144-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 31Herschbach B.M. Johnson A.D. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1993; 9: 479-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 32Gray S. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The present experiments argue against the displacement of activating factors, because binding to HSE-like elements is unnecessary for HSF1 repression (Fig. 2). In addition, the fact that HSF1 activates hsp promoters while repressing c-fos suggests that HSF1 does not globally repress the activity of basal transcription factors (Fig. 2). HSF1 may thus repress the c-fos promoter either by interaction with an upstream signal transduction component or a specific co-activator. Upstream regulation of the c-fospromoter is complex, involving serum activation of the Ras pathway and induction of serum response factor (SRF) to bind to the SRE and complex with TCF transcription factors (14Hill C.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 15Chen C.M. Clarkson R.W.E. Xie Y. Hume D.A. Waters M.J.

AP-1 activity may also be induced by Ras and lead to stimulation of the c-fos promoter as effectively as the SRE (12Herrlich P. Ponta H. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 112-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Deng T. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 371: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Because activated HSF1 is localized to the nucleus at elevated temperature, inhibition of Ras induced c-fos gene transcription by HSF1 seems to occur inside the nucleus. In Ras-MAPK signaling, the initial steps are cytoplasmic until MEK1 phosphorylates MAPK resulting in MAPK translocation to the nucleus, phosphorylation of TCFp62, and c-fos activation (14Hill C.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 33Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E.

The effects of HSF1 are likely to occur at a stage after MAPK activation because our experiments indicate that heat shock is a powerful activator of MAPK rather than an inhibitor, and the stress-activated protein kinases that are involved in AP-1 activation are likewise activated by heat (35Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). 3M. A. Stevenson and S. K. Calderwood, unpublished observation. HSF1 could interact with individual factors or with the complex of TCF-SRF, AP-1, and NFIL-6 shown to form on the c-fos promoter (14Hill C.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 15Chen C.M. Clarkson R.W.E. Xie Y. Hume D.A. Waters M.J.

In addition the uPA promoter, which is also repressed by HSF1 (Fig. 2 E), contains binding sites for Ets domain and AP-1 factors that could be targeted by HSF1 (29Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Evidence for HSF1 function downstream of the c-fos promoter is that the basal activity of a fragment from −219 to +42 from the c-fos promoter, which lacks many of the sites for upstream activation, is also repressed by HSF1 (not shown). HSF1 could thus interact with a downstream coactivating factor to specifically repress genes such as c-fos and uPA and thus block the effects of upstream activation by mitogenic signal cascades.c-fos repression is specific for HSF1 and was not observed with HSF2 expression, a finding that may suggest structural domains involved in repression (Fig. 2). The HSF1 and HSF2 sequences are highly homologous in the N-terminal DNA binding and 舠leucine zipper舡 trimerization domains while diverging in sequence in the C-terminal 300 amino acids containing regulatory and activation domains (1Voellmy R. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 357-401PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 20Rabindran S.K.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Regions mediating repression might thus be located within the C terminus.In conclusion, therefore, HSF1 functions as a Ras antagonist by repressing Ras-mediated activation of the c-fos promoter. Transcriptional repression may constitute a significant component of HSF1 function in the cellular heat shock response as well as in systemic responses, such as fever involving elevated temperatures. Heat shock results in the activation of a pre-existing transcription factor, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) 1The abbreviations used are: HSF1, heat shock factor 1; HSF2, heat shock factor 2; hsp, heat shock protein; uPa, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TCF, ternary complex factor; SRE, serum response element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FCS, fetal calf serum; SRF, serum response factor. 1The abbreviations used are: HSF1, heat shock factor 1; HSF2, heat shock factor 2; hsp, heat shock protein; uPa, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TCF, ternary complex factor; SRE, serum response element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FCS, fetal calf serum; SRF, serum response factor. through a process that includes trimerization and nuclear translocation (1Voellmy R.

Lis J.T. Cell. 1989; 59: 797-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Activated HSF1 binds to heat shock elements (HSE) in heat shock protein (hsp) gene promoters and induces expression of hsps involved in the assembly, folding, and transport of other proteins and conferring thermotolerence on expressing cells (4Price B.D. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3365-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 5Haas I.G. Wabl M.

Our recent studies indicate that in addition to being a transcriptional activator, HSF1 functions as a repressor of a number of genes including IL1B (8Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-27879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that at elevated temperatures HSF1 possesses both activation and suppression functions, depending on the nature of the target promoter (1Voellmy R. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 357-401PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 8Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-27879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of the heat shock response in mammals is somewhat mysterious considering the tight regulation of body temperature in homeotherms. However, the response may have become adapted to function during fever, the neuroendocrine response to disease that modulates elevation in body temperature (9Kruger M.J. Kozac W. Conn C.A. Leon L.R. Sosynski D. Infect. Dis. North Am. 1996; 10: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Because one function of interleukin 1ॆ, the product of the IL1B gene and a target for HSF1 repression is the mediation of fever, HSF1 could function as a feedback inhibitor of ILIB during fever (8Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-27879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We are interested to know whether HSF1 affects other genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and viral infection that might be involved in the heat shock response and the mediation of fever. One such gene is c-fos, an early response gene involved in regulating normal cellular proliferation and differentiation as well as being expressed in many types of tumors (10Holt J.T. Gopal V.

Science. 1984; 224: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). c-fosencodes the nuclear Fos protein, which associates with Jun proteins to form a heterodimeric transcription factor with AP-1 site selectivity that is a nuclear target of the Ras signaling pathway and is a participant in the replication of some viruses (12Herrlich P. Ponta H. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 112-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Deng T. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 371: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 14Hill C.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Ras, which serves as a signal transducer in a manner similar to other signal GTP-binding proteins, transmits signals from the plasma membrane to nuclear targets such as the transcription factors mentioned above (18Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). We have therefore examined the effect of HSF1 on the expression of the c-fos gene and the activity of the c-fos promoter in mitogen and Ras-stimulated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO K1) fibroblasts. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHuman HSP70B promoter construct p2500CAT was purchased from StressGen (Victoria, BC, Canada), and the humanHSP27 promoter was a gift from Drs. Lee Weber and Eileen Hickey (Department of Biology, University of Nevada). Ha-Ras expression plasmid pH06T1, control plasmid Homer 6, and mouse urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (uPa-Luc) were generous gifts from Dr. M. C. Ostrowski (Ohio State University), the CHO K1 cell line was from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection, and culture media and supplements were from Life Technologies, Inc.ConstructspGL.reporter ConstructspGL.hsp70B was constructed by inserting the HSP70B gene promoter fragment from BglII site to HindIII site (1.44 kilobases) of p2500-CAT into pGL.Basic 3 at the corresponding sites. pGL.hsp27 was constructed by inserting the HSP27 gene promoter fragment (19Oesterreich S. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Fuqua S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) from BamHI site to HindIII site (730 base pairs) into pGL.Basic 3 at the BglII and HindIIIsites. pfos 2000 was constructed by inserting the human c-fos promoter from −2000 to +42 relative to the transcription start site into pGL.Basic 2. For pfos 396, a fragment of the c-fos promoter was deleted from −2000 to −396. pfos 396D219-81 was derived from pfos 396 by deletion from −219 to −81, which increases promoter activity (18Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar).Expression ConstructsHuman HSF1 cDNA (20Rabindran S.K. Giorgi G. Clos J. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6906-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) was inserted into the pcDNA3.1(−) expression vector at the XhoI andEcoRI sites, termed as pHSF1 (+ or − indicate the orientation of the polycloning site in pcDNA3.1). Human HSF2A cDNA 2J. Marsh and S. K. Calderwood, manuscript in preparation. was inserted into the pcDNA3.1(+) EcoRI and XhoI sites to produce pHSF2A. Then the fragment from pstI to VspI sites of pSV-ॆ-Galactosidase plasmid, containing SV40 early promoter and enhancer segments, lacZ coding region and SV40 poly(A) signals, was inserted into the pHSF plasmids atNsiI and SapI sites to replace the Neomycin resistance gene, and these constructs were termed p-B-HSF1 and p-B-HSF2, respectively. pHSF1mut was derived from p-B-HSF1 by digesting HSF1 with the PflMI, blunting with Klenow, and religating. A leucine was thus inserted into HSF1 at position 22 to mutate the N-terminal DNA binding domain. p-B-control plasmid was derived from p-B-HSF1 by deleting HSF1 at the XhoI and EcoRI sites. After blunting with Klenow, the resulting fragment was religated. Constructs were confirmed by sequencing with a T7 kit (Amersham). Double stranded DNA templates were prepared from minipreps as described (21Sal G.D. Manfioletti G. Schneider C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).Northern AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated, fractionated on 17 agarose/formaldehyde gels, and transferred to membranes as described (8Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-27879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific mRNAs were detected by hybridization with a rat c-fos cDNA probe (2.2-kilobase cDNA fragment) and a murine HSP 70.1cDNA probe (22Hunt C. Calderwood S.K.

Clarkson R.W.E. Xie Y. Hume D.A. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4505-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared as described, and luciferase and ॆ-galactosidase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). ॆ-Galactosidase and luciferase activity was measured as described (15Chen C.M. Clarkson R.W.E. Xie Y. Hume D.A. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4505-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to ॆ-galactosidase activity, which was used as an internal transfection efficiency control. Results are expressed as fold activity of control. Analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple range test was employed for statistical analysis of luciferase values.Stable TransfectionAfter transfection, cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing 107 FCS for 24 h. Neomycin (G418) was added to 300 ng/ml until surviving cells reached confluence. Surviving clones were then selected and amplified.EMSANuclear extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al.

https://openalex.org/W2130518310,"SR 31747A, defined as a sigma ligand, is a novel immunosuppressive agent that blocks proliferation of human and mouse lymphocytes. Using a radiolabeled chemical probe, we here purified a target of SR 31747A and called it SR 31747A-binding protein (SR-BP). Purified SR-BP retained its binding properties and migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel as a M r 28,000 protein. Cloning of the cDNA encoding human SR-BP shows an open reading frame for a 223-amino acid protein, which is homologous to the recently cloned sigma 1 receptor. Interestingly, the deduced amino acid sequence was found to be related to fungal C8-C7 sterol isomerase, encoded by the ERG2 gene. The ERG2 gene product has been identified recently as the molecular target of SR 31747A that mediates antiproliferative effects of the drug in yeast. Northern blot analysis of SR-BP gene expression revealed a single transcript of 2 kilobases which was widely expressed among organs, with the highest abundance in liver and the lowest abundance in brain. Subcellular localization analysis in various cells, using a specific monoclonal antibody raised against SR-BP, demonstrated that this protein was associated with the nuclear envelope. When studying the binding of SR 31747A on membranes from yeast expressing SR-BP, we found a pharmacological profile of sigma 1 receptors; binding was displaced by (+)-pentazocine, haloperidol, and (+)-SKF 10,047, with (+)-SKF 10,047 being a more potent competitor than (−)-SKF 10,047. Scatchard plot analysis revealed K d values of 7.1 nm and 0.15 nm for (+)-pentazocine and SR 31747A, respectively, indicating an affinity of SR-BP 50-fold higher for SR 31747A than for pentazocine. Additionally, we showed that pentazocine, a competitive inhibitor of SR 31747A binding, also prevents the immunosuppressive effect of SR 31747A. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that SR-BP represents the molecular target for SR 31747A in mammalian tissues, which could be critical for T cell proliferation.

Sigma 2 refers to a site that binds these drugs with lower affinity, and which is selective for (−)-optical enantiomers of pentazocine, SKF 10,047, and 3-PPP. A lower affinity sigma 3 site has been reported in rat and guinea pig brain (20Myers A.M. Charifson P.S. Owens C.E. Kula N.S. McPhail A.T. Baldessarini R.J. Booth R.G. Wyrick S.D. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 4109-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). More recently, a novel binding site was discovered that binds all sigma ligands with two notable exceptions: haloperidol and 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine (21Whitlock B.B. Liu Y. Chang S. Saini P. Ha B.K.

Bell J.A. Spivak C.E. London E.D. Su T.-P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 257: 351-359PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the cross-reactivity of many drugs that bind with high affinity to other receptors has impeded efforts to define precisely the sites for SR 31747A binding.Recently, we examined the effect of this drug in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. We showed that SR 31747A arrested cell proliferation by inhibiting an enzyme of the sterol biosynthetic pathway, namely C8-C7 sterol isomerase (23Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.-H. Lanau C.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2719-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).In the present work, we undertook a biochemical characterization of a molecular entity that specifically binds SR 31747A using [3H]SR 31747A as the specific probe and the human T leukemia cell line Ichikawa as the biological source. We purified the protein carrying the SR 31747A binding site and cloned the corresponding cDNA, which was shown to be homologous to the yeastERG2 gene. Expression of SR-BP cDNA in yeast S. cerevisiae led to high affinity binding sites for SR 31747A indistinguishable from mammalian sites. We also present the tissue distribution and subcellular localization and discuss the structural features of this receptor and its possible functions.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents[3H](+)-Pentazocine (NET 1056–1550 GBq/mmol) was supplied by NEN Life Science Products (Paris, France).

Akers (BASF Aktiengesellshaft, Limburgerhof, Germany). LH2O, DEAE-Sepharose, Mono Q HR 10/10, Superdex 200 HR, and CNBr-Sepharose 4B were purchased from Pharmacia (Orsay, France). Q Hyper D column was from Biosepra (Frankfurt, Germany).Strains, Media, and Growth ConditionsEMY43 (MATα, ura3Δ, trp1–4, erg2::TRP1) and EMY47 (MATα, ura3Δ, trp1–4, erg2::TRP1, fen1::LEU2) were isogenic derivatives of S. cerevisiae wild type FL100 (ATCC-28383). C13-ABYS86 (EMY761, MATα, ura3Δ5 leu2–3 leu2–112 his3 pra1 prb1 prc1 cps1) was kindly provided by Heinemeyer et al. (24Heinemeyer W. Kleinschmidt J.A. Saidowski J. Escher C. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Yeast culture media were YPD medium and synthetic minimal (SD) medium containing 27 glucose (25Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-863PubMed Google Scholar). Anaerobic conditions were obtained using an anaerobic glove box (La Calhène, Vélizy, France) under N2-H2-CO2 (85–107-57) atmosphere. For anaerobic growth, media were supplemented with 0.17 Tween 80 and 50 mg/liter ergosterol.Drug Binding AssaySR 31747A Binding Assays on Soluble ReceptorTo monitor SR 31747A binding activity during the purification process, a SR 31747A binding assay on soluble receptor was developed. Briefly, 2 nm [3H]SR 31747A was incubated with 10 to 50 ॖl of each fraction in a final volume of 250 ॖl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.17 BSA for 30 min at 20 °C. Separation of bound from free ligands was obtained by gel filtration with a 1-ml LH 20 column. Samples (200 ॖl) were loaded onto the column and eluted with 1.8 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The 2-ml volume containing bound [3H]SR 31747A was mixed with 10 ml of scintillation liquid and counted for radioactivity.In competition studies using purified receptor, various concentrations (0.4–1000 nm) of unlabeled ligands were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C with 1 nm [3H]SR 31747A in 500 ॖl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.17 BSA, 0.027 digitonin, 0.027 Tween 20). For saturation analysis, purified receptor was incubated for 2 h at 20 °C with increasing concentrations of [3H]SR 31747A (0.03–3 nm) in the presence or absence of 1 ॖm SR 31747A in binding buffer.SR 31747A Binding Studies on Yeast Cell MembranesYeast cells were treated with zymolyase as described previously (26Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and homogenized at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, for membrane preparation. Receptor binding assays for [3H](+)-pentazocine and [3H]SR 31747A were performed according to the methods described by Paul et al.(13Paul R. Lavastre S. Floutard D. Floutard R. Canat X. Casellas P.

Neuroimmunol. 1994; 52: 183-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Purification of the Human SR 31747A-binding Protein (SR-BP)Human T leukemia Ichikawa cells (2 × 1010cells) were suspended in 200 ml of a buffer containing 70 mm sucrose, 210 mmd-mannitol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl-1)-phenylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, then homogenized using a Turrax homogenizer. The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 650 ×g for 20 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The membrane-containing pellet was solubilized at 10 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl-1)-phenylsulfonyl fluoride, 27 digitonin. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant was then subjected to chromatography successively on DEAE-Sepharose column (2.5 × 11 cm), Mono Q column (1 × 10 cm), Q Hyper D column (0.5 × 10 cm), and then Superdex 200 HR column (1 × 30 cm). These columns were pre-equilibrated with TDG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.17 digitonin). Bound proteins were eluted with linear NaCl gradient (0–500 mm) in TDG buffer. Peak fractions containing SR 31747-binding protein were monitored by [3H]SR 31747 binding activity. Purified binding activity from 200 HR column was used for generation of specific antibodies as described below.To immunopurify SR-BP, active peak from the DEAE-Sepharose was loaded onto a 2-ml column of anti-SR-BP Sepharose obtained by coupling purified monoclonal anti-SR-BP antibody (see below) to CNBr-activated Sepharose (ratio: 0.5 mg of proteins/ml of Sepharose). Bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine pH 3.0, 0.5 mNaCl, 0.027 digitonin. The fractions containing binding activity were neutralized to pH 7.0 with 1 m Tris-HCl and concentrated for further analysis.Anti-SR-BP Monoclonal Antibody ObtentionPositive fractions from Q Hyper D chromatography were incubated with 2 nm [3H]SR 31747A for 2 h at 20 °C and chromatographed on Superdex 200 HR as described above. Fractions containing the maximum radioactivity were pooled and used as tritiated SR-BP ([3H]SR-BP) for antibody screening.Three mice were immunized by subcutaneous injection of 10 ॖg of proteins of enriched SR-BP preparation from Superdex 200 HR chromatography in Freund's complete adjuvant. On days 30 and 60, mice were boosted with 10 ॖg of proteins in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Sera were collected on days 38 and 68, diluted to 100 ॖl in PBS buffer containing 0.17 BSA and 0.17 Tween 20, and then incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 100 ॖl of solution containing 5000 dpm of [3H]SR-BP. Separation of free and bound antibodies was obtained by addition of 1 ml of 207 polyethylene glycol 4000, followed by a centrifugation at 4000 × g. The pellet containing bound antibodies was dissolved in 1 ml of PBS mixed with 10 ml of scintillation liquid and counted for radioactivity.For the production of monoclonal antibodies, 3 days before fusion, mice were boosted intravenously with 10 ॖg of proteins. Splenocytes were collected and fused with P3 × 63Ag8.653 mouse myeloma cells. Screening for anti-SR-BP antibodies was performed using [3H]SR-BP. Antibodies were produced in mice and purified from ascitic fluid by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose.Electrophoresis and ImmunoblotSDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated for 1 h at 20 °C in 57 nonfat dry milk in 0.17 Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, then for 1 h at 20 °C with monoclonal antibody at 0.5 ॖg/ml in the same buffer. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were added, and protein detection was performed with ECL kit (Amersham) as described in the manufacturer's protocol.Partial Amino Acid Sequencing of SR-BPImmunopurified SR-BP was subjected to SDS-PAGE. After gel staining with Coomassie Blue G-250, the 28-kDa band was cut out and subjected to trypsin hydrolysis, which generated six distinct peptides. Edman's degradation was performed using an Applied Biosystems model 477A pulse-liquid sequenator connected on line to an RP-HPLC unit (model 120A, Applied Biosystems) (28Hewick R.M. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Dreyer W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Molecular Cloning of Human SR-BP cDNATwo degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based on the amino acid sequence of the longer peptide (these were derived from GARGTNTTYTAYCCIGGIGARAC (sense) and from CATVCANGTRTTIGGICCCCAYTC (antisense)) (Fig. 3). PCR was performed using 100 ng of first strand cDNA prepared from Daudi mRNA. The 80-bp PCR product was further subcloned into PGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. Two matched antisense primers (AS1: 5′-GCCCCACTCCACAGCTGTTGCCTC-3′; AS2: 5′-ACCAGGCCCGTGTACTACCGTCTC-3′) complementary to the middle of the sequence were used to amplify the 5′ end of cDNA with the RACE system (Life Technologies, Inc.). A PCR product of about 320 bp was subcloned into PGEM-T and sequenced. This DNA fragment was used as a probe to screen a Daudi λ UniZAP XR cDNA library. The longest isolated clone was fully sequenced, and sequence analyses were performed with Blast (29Altschul S.P. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69141) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignment was produced by the clustal W program.Expression of SR-BP cDNA in S. cerevisiaeThe open reading frame of SR-BP was cloned by PCR amplification using two oligonucleotides, A and B. The oligonucleotide sequence of A (forward, BamHI, SalI) was as follows: ATCAGGATCCGTCGACAACATGCAATGGGCTGTTGGTAGACGGTGGGCGTGGGCC) and corresponded to the first 12 codons of SR-BP with some modifications at the DNA level to improve mRNA translation. The oligonucleotide sequence of B (reverse, BamHI, XbaI) corresponded to positions +662 to +684 (relative to the first base of the initiation codon). The amplified DNA fragment was cloned between theSalI and BamHI sites of the pEMR1023 polylinker (23Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.-H. Lanau C. Kaghad M. Dhers C. Picard C. Rahier A. Taton M.

The SR-BP open reading frame was expressed under the control of the PGK promoter.Northern Blot AnalysisThe expression of SR-BP mRNA in human tissues was examined by Northern blot analysis using membranes purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Hybridization was carried out in Church buffer (30Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7258) Google Scholar) with a 32P-labeled 300-bp probe specific for SR-BP cDNA. Autoradiography was performed overnight with an intensifying screen.Analysis of Subcellular Localization of SR-BP by Confocal MicroscopyCells were fixed overnight with 17 formaldehyde at 4 °C, washed once in PBS, and permeabilized for 10 min with a solution of 0.17 saponin in PBS containing 17 BSA. Biotinylated conjugated anti-SR-BP mAb, and anti-mitochondria M117 or anti-nuclear membrane AE-5 mAbs (Leinco Technologies Inc., St. Louis, MO) were simultaneously incubated with cells in the 0.17 saponin, 17 BSA solution for 30 min at room temperature. After two washes, cells were simultaneously incubated for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 Abs (Southern Biotechnology Inc., Birmingham, AL) to stain M117 or AE-5 mAbs, and with Cy5-conjugated streptavidin (from Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) to stain biotinylated conjugated anti-SR-BP mAb. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 ॖl of glycerol containing the anti-bleaching reagent DABCO at 50 mg/ml. A laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM410, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a planapo oil (× 63) immersion lens (numerical aperture = 1.4) was used to analyze the three-dimensional distribution of SR-BP as described previously (31Dussossoy D. Carayon P. Feraut D. Belugou S. Combes T. Canat X. Vidal H. Casellas P. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).In Vitro Lymphocyte ProliferationMouse splenocytes were cultured in 96-well flat-bottomed plates in quadruplicate at 4 × 105 cells/well with 1 ॖg/ml staphylococcal enterotoxin B. Cells were cultured in complete medium for 4 days in the presence of various concentrations of SR 31747A or (+)-pentazocine, then pulsed with 1 ॖCi/well [3H]thymidine (Amersham, les Ulis, France), and harvested 4 h later on glass fiber papers using a Skatron harvester system (Pharmacia). Incorporated radioactivity was measured by using a Betaplate liquid scintillation spectrometer (Pharmacia).DISCUSSIONSR 31747A is an immunomodulating agent eliciting high affinity for sigma receptors. It demonstrates immunosuppressive properties bothin vitro and in vivo (14Casellas P. Bourrié B. Canat X. Carayon P. Buisson I. Paul R. Brelière J.-C. Le Fur G. J. Neuroimmunol. 1994; 52: 193-203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This compound, which blocks the proliferation of lymphocytes at nanomolar concentrations, displays a spectrum of activity distinct from current immunosuppressive agents (35Derocq J.-M. Bourrié B. Ségui M. Le Fur G. Casellas P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 224-230PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies suffered from a lack of information on the binding protein involved to relate the observed effects to a biochemical process (36Bourrié B. Bouaboula M. Benoı̂t J.-M. Derocq J.-M. Esclangon M. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In an attempt to decipher this, we have purified, cloned, sequenced, and expressed the SR-BP. We also studied the tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and pharmacological properties of this protein.Molecular Characterization of SR-BPPartial purification of the digitonin-solubilized SR-BP from cells of the human T leukemic Ichikawa cell line was achieved by three successive ion-exchange chromatographic steps followed by a gel filtration. The specific activity obtained was 510 pmol/mg of protein, representing a 160-fold increase over the specific activity of the crude extract. This preparation was used to generate a monoclonal antibody anti-SR-BP, which in turn enabled the subsequent purification of SR-BP. Immunopurified SR-BP was used for partial amino acid sequence analyses, after which the corresponding cDNA was cloned. The nucleotide sequence of the SR-BP cDNA encodes a 223-amino acid protein. Furthermore, the characterization of the heterologous expression of the SR-BP cDNA in yeast demonstrates that the cloned cDNA encodes a protein that has a high affinity [3H]SR 31747A-binding domain and is specifically recognized by anti SR-BP-antibodies.In the course of this study, we cloned the guinea pig and human sigma 1 receptor cDNA and found a 937 and 1007 amino acid sequence identity, respectively, with SR-BP (32Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Flandorfer A. Knaus H.-G. Striessnig J. Kempner E. Glossmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 33Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Fei Y.J. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We discuss below successively (i) the relationship of SR-BP and sigma 1 receptor, and (ii) the relationship of SR-BP and Erg2p.Comparison of SR-BP and Sigma 1 ReceptorThe sigma 1 receptor was recently purified and characterized from guinea pig liver by Hanneret al. (32Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Flandorfer A. Knaus H.-G. Striessnig J. Kempner E. Glossmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. 1997; 18: 67-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)). The high degree of homology between the two proteins suggests that it could be the guinea pig counterpart of human SR-BP. We show here that the SR 31747A binding profile fits with the pharmacological definition of sigma 1 receptor: 1) SR-BP binds the sigma ligands, pentazocine and haloperidol with high affinity; 2) only one stereoisomer of pentazocine efficiently competed for [3H]SR 31747A-labeled sites, which is a trait characteristic of the sigma 1 receptor previously characterized in rat spleen (10Wolfe Jr., S.A.

Our results obtained with [3H]pentazocine are in line with those of Hanner et al. (32Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Flandorfer A. Knaus H.-G. Striessnig J. Kempner E. Glossmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) on the sigma 1 receptor from guinea pig.From saturation studies with SR 31747A and (+)-pentazocine binding on SR-BP, we concluded that both ligands bound to a single population of sites. As SR 31747A was competitively displaced by (+)-pentazocine and reciprocally, it is very likely that SR 31747A and (+)-pentazocine bind the same site. Nevertheless, B max values (6195 and 3860 fmol/mg proteins for SR 31747A and (+)-pentazocine, respectively) were slightly different and the SR 31747A affinity was 50-fold higher than that of (+)-pentazocine. We observed an irreversible (or very slowly dissociable) binding of [3H]SR 31747A at SR-BP.Comparison between SR-BP and Erg2pSR-BP shares a significant sequence identity with Erg2p (29.97). We have shown that this latter protein is the target that mediates the anti-proliferation effects of SR 31747A in yeast (23Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.-H. Lanau C. Kaghad M. Dhers C.

G6Pase activity appears to be conferred by a set of proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, including a glucose-6-phosphate translocase, a G6Pase phosphohydrolase or catalytic subunit, and glucose and inorganic phosphate transporters in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In the current study, we used a recombinant adenovirus containing the cDNA encoding the G6Pase catalytic subunit (AdCMV-G6Pase) to evaluate the metabolic impact of overexpression of the enzyme in primary hepatocytes. We found that AdCMV-G6Pase-treated liver cells contain significantly less glycogen and Glu-6-P, but unchanged UDP-glucose levels, relative to control cells. Further, the glycogen synthase activity state was closely correlated with Glu-6-P levels over a wide range of glucose concentrations in both G6Pase-overexpressing and control cells. The reduction in glycogen synthesis in AdCMV-G6Pase-treated hepatocytes is therefore not a function of decreased substrate availability but rather occurs because of the regulatory effects of Glu-6-P on glycogen synthase activity. We also found that AdCMV-G6Pase-treated-cells had significantly lower rates of lactate production and [3-3H]glucose usage, coupled with enhanced rates of gluconeogenesis and Glu-6-P hydrolysis. We conclude that overexpression of the G6Pase catalytic subunit alone is sufficient to activate flux through the G6Pase system in liver cells. Further, hepatocytes treated with AdCMV-G6Pase exhibit a metabolic profile resembling that of liver cells from patients or animals with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, suggesting that dysregulation of the catalytic subunit of G6Pase could contribute to the etiology of the disease.

These include a glucose-6-phosphate translocase that transports Glu-6-P from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the ER, the G6Pase phosphohydrolase or catalytic subunit that appears to reside in the lumen, and putative ER membrane-localized glucose and inorganic phosphate transporters that allow removal of the products of the reaction. To date, cDNA clones for the G6Pase catalytic subunit from several species (2Shelly L.L. Lei K.J. Pan C.-J. Sakata S.F. Ruppert S. Schutz G. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

J. 1992; 286: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have been isolated and analyzed, but the glucose-6-phosphate translocase remains uncharacterized. The existence of the translocase as a discrete entity is strongly supported by genetic studies (6Lei K.J. Shelly L.L. Lin B. Sidbury J.B. Chen Y.T. Nordlie R.C. Chou J.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 234-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the translocase and phosphohydrolase activities appear to be tightly linked (7Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Mansfiel B.C. Chou J.-Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Glucose causes activation of glycogen synthesis in the liver. This effect appears to be mediated by accumulation of Glu-6-P, the levels of which are directly correlated with the activation state of the rate-limiting enzyme for glycogenesis, glycogen synthase (8Ciudad C.J.

The Glu-6-P concentration in hepatocytes is determined in part by the opposing actions of G6Pase and the glucose-phosphorylating enzyme glucokinase. Glucokinase expression has been shown to decrease, and expression of the G6Pase catalytic subunit to increase, in several animal models of diabetes (11Burchell A. Cain D.I. Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Barzilai N. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25019-25025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Massillon D.

Minassian C. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and these changes have been correlated with an increase in hepatic glucose production that appears to contribute to the diabetic phenotype, leading to the suggestion that the ratio of glucokinase:G6Pase is an important determinant of the metabolic fate of glucose in liver cells (12Barzilai N. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25019-25025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While such a model is logical, the fact that G6Pase activity is imparted by a set of proteins, any of which could be rate-determining for the overall reaction, suggests that it should not be assumed that changes in expression of the G6Pase catalytic subunit necessarily correlate with altered rates of Glu-6-P hydrolysis in intact cells. Furthermore, the relative importance of changes in glucokinase versus G6Pase expression in liver has not been adequately defined. In fact, overexpression of glucokinase alone in isolated hepatocytes results in a large stimulation in glycogen synthesis, occurring in concert with increased Glu-6-P levels and an enhanced activation state of glycogen synthase (15Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gómez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16O'Doherty R.M.

A further complication is introduced by the recent finding that adenovirus-mediated expression of glucokinase in hepatoma cells that are otherwise deficient in this enzyme activity leads to a glucose-stimulated increase in G6Pase expression (17Argaud D. Kirby T.L. Newgard C.B. Lange A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12854-12861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, G6Pase gene expression appears to be positively regulated by glucose but negatively regulated by insulin (13Massillon D. Barzilai N. Chen W. Hu M. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9871-9874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Mithieux G. Vidal H. Zitoun C. Bruni N. Daniele N. Minassian C.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that a large number of other enzymes of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are regulated by these two effectors, including glucokinase, which is highly sensitive to induction by insulin (19Pilkis S.J. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), makes it difficult to isolate the contribution of changes in G6Pase expression to regulation of glucose metabolism in whole animal models. In this study, we have utilized a recombinant adenovirus containing the cDNA encoding the catalytic subunit of G6Pase (20Trinh K. Minassian C. Lange A.J. O'Doherty R.M. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24837-24842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) to provide specific insight into the metabolic impact of its overexpression in primary hepatocytes. We demonstrate that overexpression of this single protein has a pronounced effect on glycolytic and gluconeogenic flux and on glycogen synthesis. The profound reduction in glycogen accumulation observed in the face of reduced Glu-6-P levels in G6Pase-overexpressing hepatocytes provides further support for an essential role for this intermediate in the activation of glycogen synthesis. Recombinant adenoviruses containing the cDNAs encoding the rat G6Pase catalytic subunit (AdCMV-G6Pase) or the Escherichia coliॆ-galactosidase gene (AdCMV-ॆGal) were prepared as described previously (20Trinh K.

FEBS Lett. 1977; 82: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Whittaker) supplemented with 10 mm glucose, 107 fetal bovine serum (Whittaker), 100 nm insulin (Boehringer Mannheim), and 100 nm dexamethasone (Sigma) and seeded onto plastic plates of 60-mm diameter treated with 0.17 gelatin (Sigma) at a final density of 6 × 104 cell/cm2. After cell attachment (5 h at 37 °C), hepatocytes were treated with stocks of AdCMV-G6Pase or AdCMV-ॆGal at a multiplicity of infection of 8 for 2 h at 37 °C. After treatment with recombinant viruses, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mmglucose, 1 nm dexamethasone, and 1 nm insulin. Cells were incubated for 16 h prior to the experimental manipulations detailed in the legend to Table I. At the end of each experimental manipulation, cell monolayers were frozen in liquid N2 until analysis.Table IEffects of G6Pase overexpression on glucose phosphorylating activityUntreatedAdCMV-G6Pase0.5 mmglucose3.55 ± 0.223.63 ± 0.39100 mm glucose15.1 ± 0.5314.85 ± 1.0Rat hepatocytes were treated with AdCMV-G6Pase or left untreated and incubated for 16 h in the presence of 1 mm glucose.

Open table in a new tab Rat hepatocytes were treated with AdCMV-G6Pase or left untreated and incubated for 16 h in the presence of 1 mm glucose. Cells were then exposed to the concentrations of glucose indicated for 2 h and collected for measurement of glucose phosphorylating activity in the presence of 0.5 or 100 mm glucose in the assay. Data are expressed in terms of nmol of glucose phosphorylated/min/106 cells and represent the mean ± S.E. for four independent experiments. To measure enzyme activities, 100 ॖl of homogenization buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm KF, 15 mm EDTA, 600 mm sucrose, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to frozen plates containing the cell monolayers, and cells were collected with a plastic scraper. Cell bursting was caused by thawing, except in the G6Pase activity assay, where sonication was used, and checked under light microscopy for completeness. Homogenates were collected in Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants and/or pellets were used for determinations. Protein concentration was measured as described by Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad assay reagent. Glucose phosphorylating activity was measured spectrophotometrically in 10,000 × g supernatant fractions of hepatocyte extracts at 37 °C in the presence of 100 mm and 0.5 mm glucose as described (25Kuwajima M. Newgard C.B. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8849-8853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase activity was measured in the presence or absence of 6.6 mm Glu-6-P as described (26Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) in both supernatant and pellet fractions. The activity measured in the absence of Glu-6-P represents the active form of the enzyme, whereas the activity tested in the presence of 6.6 mm Glu-6-P is a measure of total activity. The ratio of these two activities is known as the glycogen synthase activity ratio and is an estimate of the degree of activation of the enzyme. G6Pase activity was measured in both supernatant and pellet fractions of sonicated homogenates as described (27Alegre M. Ciudad C.J. Fillat C. Guinovart J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Glycogen content was measured by scraping cells into 307 KOH and boiling the extract for 15 min. Glycogen was measured as described (28Chan T.M. Exton J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The intracellular concentrations of Glu-6-P and UDP-glucose were measured by previously described spectrophotometric assays (29Lang G. Michal G. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 1238-1242Google Scholar, 30Keppler D. Decker K. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 1464-1468Google Scholar). l-Lactate levels in the incubation medium were measured as described (31Gutmann I. Wahlefeld A.W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 1464-1468Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were left untreated or treated with AdCMV-G6Pase and, after removal of the virus, incubated for 16 h in the supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium described earlier. Glucose usage in AdCMV-G6Pase or untreated hepatocytes was assayed by incubation of cells with 5 or 20 mm[3-3H]glucose and measurement of3H2O production as described previously (32Hughes S.D. Quaade C. Johnson J.H. Ferber S. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15205-15212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In separate assays, 3H2O incorporation into glucose was measured as recently described (20Trinh K. Minassian C. Lange A.J. O'Doherty R.M. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24837-24842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with Krebs-bicarbonate buffer containing 0.57 bovine serum albumin and incubated for 3 h in the same buffer containing either 5 or 20 mm glucose plus 3H2O (1.25 mCi/100 ml of medium; NEN Life Science Products). Media samples were collected, and 3H-labeled glucose was separated from other labeled media components by silica gel thin layer chromatography. Glucose production was assayed in hepatocytes incubated for 16 h in the supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium described earlier. Cells were then incubated either in a medium containing 5 mm alanine, glycine, and glutamine or in another medium containing 10 mm lactate and 1 mm pyruvate for 2 h. Media were collected for glucose determination. G6Pase enzymatic activity was measured in the 10,000 × g supernatant and pellet fractions of extracts prepared from sonicated hepatocytes treated with either the control virus AdCMV-ॆGAL or the AdCMV-G6Pase virus containing the cDNA encoding the G6Pase catalytic subunit. Measurement of G6Pase enzymatic activity in hepatocyte extracts prepared 18 h after treatment with AdCMV-G6Pase revealed an 8-fold increase in activity in the supernatant fraction relative to untreated or AdCMV-ॆGal-treated control cells (untreated, 21.5 ± 3.2; AdCMV-ॆGal-treated, 18.3 ± 5.1; AdCMV-G6Pase-treated, 176.7 ± 20.4 milliunits/106 cells) and a similar 9-fold increase in the pellet fraction (untreated, 7.2 ± 0.8; AdCMV-ॆGal-treated, 6.1 ± 1.1; AdCMV-G6Pase-treated, 63.1 ± 5.9 milliunits/106 cells). The supernatant fraction contained 737 of the total G6Pase activity. Thus, both the magnitude of increase and the distribution of G6Pase enzyme activity is similar to what we have recently reported for AdCMV-G6Pase treatment of INS-1 rat insulinoma cells (20Trinh K. Minassian C. Lange A.J. O'Doherty R.M. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24837-24842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We next evaluated the effect of AdCMV-G6Pase treatment on total glucose phosphorylating capacity and Glu-6-P levels in hepatocytes. As shown in TableI, overexpression of G6Pase had no effect on total glucose phosphorylating capacity in hepatocyte extracts, measured at either 0.5 or 100 mm glucose, indicating that the AdCMV-G6Pase virus allows us to specifically manipulate G6Pase activity in liver cells without affecting glucose phosphorylation. Untreated, AdCMV-G6Pase-treated, or AdCMV-ॆGal-treated cells preincubated for 16 h in 1 mm glucose and then transferred to media containing 1, 5, 10, or 25 mm glucose for 2 h exhibited a glucose concentration-dependent increase in Glu-6-P levels. However, AdCMV-G6Pase-treated cells had lower Glu-6-P levels for all conditions studied than either control group, the effect becoming more pronounced with increasing media glucose concentration (Fig. 1). The maximal difference was observed at 25 mm glucose, where Glu-6-P levels were reduced by 257 in AdCMV-G6Pase-treated cells relative to untreated or AdCMV-ॆGal-treated control cells. Flux through G6Pase in untreated and AdCMV-G6Pase-treated hepatocytes was measured either by incorporation of 3H2O into glucose (occurring at the hexose phosphate isomerase reaction and during hydrolysis of Glu-6-P) or by incubation of hepatocytes with gluconeogenic precursors and measurement of the increase in glucose concentration in the media. Cells were preincubated in 1 mmglucose for 16 h and then shifted to media containing either 5 or 20 mm glucose plus 3H2O for 2 h. Treatment of hepatocytes with AdCMV-G6Pase caused an 8.1-fold increase in 3H incorporation into glucose at 5 mm glucose and a 6-fold increase at 20 mmglucose relative to untreated cells incubated at the same glucose concentrations (Fig. 2). We have previously shown that treatment of INS-1 cells with AdCMV-ॆGal has no effect on 3H2O incorporation into glucose relative to untreated control cells (20Trinh K. Minassian C. Lange A.J. O'Doherty R.M. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24837-24842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), so this control was not included in the present study. Thus, overexpression of the catalytic subunit of G6Pase alone is sufficient to cause a large increase in Glu-6-P hydrolysis and flux through the G6Pase system in hepatocytes. Total gluconeogenic flux was measured in the presence of gluconeogenic amino acids (a mixture of 5 mm alanine, 5 mmglycine, and 5 mm glutamine) or in medium supplemented with 10 mm lactate, 1 mm pyruvate by measurement of the media glucose concentration. Experiments were conducted by preincubation of AdCMV-G6Pase-treated or untreated cells in 1 mm glucose for 16 h, followed by a 2-h incubation in either of the two gluconeogenic media. As shown in Fig.3, both untreated and AdCMV-G6Pase-treated hepatocytes produced more glucose when incubated with the lactate/pyruvate mixture than with the mixture of gluconeogenic amino acids. Further, AdCMV-G6Pase-treated cells produced 407 more glucose from the amino acids and 477 more from lactate/pyruvate than did untreated cells. Overexpression of the catalytic subunit of G6Pase alone therefore results in enhanced glucose production from gluconeogenic precursors, suggesting that the G6Pase step participates in control of the overall rate of gluconeogenesis in isolated hepatocytes.Figure 3Effects of G6Pase overexpression on gluconeogenesis. Hepatocytes were treated with AdCMV-G6Pase (white bars) or left untreated (black bars) and incubated for 16 h in the presence of 1 mm glucose. Cells were then incubated in a medium containing 5 mmalanine, glycine, and glutamine (AA) or in another medium containing 10 mm lactate and 1 mm pyruvate (L/P) for 2 h. Media were collected for glucose determination. Data represent the mean ± S.E. for four independent experiments. ***, statistical significance atp < 0.001 for comparisons with untreated hepatocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The impact of overexpression of the G6Pase catalytic subunit on glycolytic flux was determined by measurement of lactate production and by incubation of cells with [3-3H]glucose and measurement of glucose usage as a function of 3H2O production. Lactate accumulation measured in the media of cells incubated for 8 h in the presence of 1, 5, 10, or 25 mm glucose was found to increase in a glucose concentration-dependent manner in untreated and AdCMV-G6Pase-treated hepatocytes, but this increase was significantly attenuated in AdCMV-G6Pase-treated cells (Fig.4). The effect of AdCMV-G6Pase on lactate production resembled its effect on Glu-6-P levels (Fig. 1), with a maximal difference in lactate accumulation of 327 observed at 25 mm glucose, similar to the 257 difference in Glu-6-P levels at this glucose concentration. [3-3H]glucose usage was reduced by 517 at 5 mm glucose and 497 at 20 mm glucose in AdCMV-G6Pase-treated hepatocytes relative to untreated control cells (Fig. 5). We have previously demonstrated that the AdCMV-ॆGal virus has no effect on glucose usage or lactate production in hepatocytes relative to untreated cells (16O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20524-20530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and this control was therefore not included in the current study. Thus, while the effect of G6Pase overexpression on glucose usage appeared slightly larger than its effect on lactate accumulation, particularly at low glucose, a significant decrease in glycolytic flux is indicated by both methods.Figure 5[3-3H]Glucose usage.Untreated or AdCMV-G6Pase-treated hepatocytes were incubated in Krebs-bicarbonate buffer containing 5 (white bars) or 20 (hatched bars) mm glucose plus tracer [3-3H]glucose. Values represent the mean ± S.E. for three independent experiments.

First, we determined the levels of the immediate precursor for glycogen synthesis, UDP-glucose. Using an experimental approach identical to that described earlier for the determination of Glu-6-P levels, we found no significant differences in UDP-glucose levels in AdCMV-G6Pase-treated compared with untreated hepatocytes at any concentration of glucose tested (Fig. 6). Next, we measured glycogen content in groups of hepatocytes treated identically as for the Glu-6-P and UDP-glucose assays. Glycogen content increased in a glucose concentration-dependent manner in untreated, AdCMV-ॆGal-treated, and AdCMV-G6Pase-treated cells, but glycogenesis was markedly reduced at all glucose concentrations in the AdCMV-G6Pase-treated group (Fig. 7). The most dramatic difference was observed at 25 mm glucose, where AdCMV-G6Pase-treated cells contained only 457 of the glycogen found in either group of control cells.Figure 7Effects of G6Pase overexpression on glycogen content. Hepatocytes were treated with AdCMV-G6Pase (□) or AdCMV-ॆGal (▩) or left untreated (▪) and were incubated in different glucose concentrations as described in the legend to Table I. Cells were then collected and assayed for glycogen content. Data represent the mean ± S.E. for four independent experiments. Theasterisks indicate statistical significance at the following levels: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001 for comparisons between AdCMV-G6Pase and untreated or AdCMV-ॆGal-treated hepatocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In light of the large effect of G6Pase expression on glycogen synthesis, we next investigated the activation state of the rate-limiting enzyme for glycogenesis, glycogen synthase. Total glycogen synthase activity, measured in the presence of 6.6 mm Glu-6-P, was not different in untreated and AdCMV-G6Pase-treated hepatocytes (1.35 ± 0.04 versus1.30 ± 0.04 milliunits/106 cells, respectively), and the amount of glycogen synthase protein measured by immunoblotting was also the same in the two groups (data not shown). The glycogen synthase activity ratio is calculated as the ratio of enzyme activity measured in the absence of Glu-6-P to that in the presence of Glu-6-P, and it is a measure of the activation state of the enzyme. This activity ratio was determined for glycogen synthase recovered in the 10,000 ×g supernatant and pellet fractions of extracts prepared from hepatocytes incubated with increasing concentrations of glucose, as described earlier for the Glu-6-P, UDP-glucose, and glycogen measurements. The glycogen synthase activity ratio increased in a glucose concentrationdependent fashion in both untreated and AdCMV-G6Pase-treated hepatocytes and in both the supernatant and pellet fractions, but cells treated with AdCMV-G6Pase experienced a much smaller increase in activity ratio in both subcellular fractions (Figs.8, A and B). We have previously shown that a control virus had no effect on the glycogen synthase activity ratio in hepatocytes relative to untreated cells (15Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gómez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), so the AdCMV-ॆGal virus control was not included in the current study. The changes in the activity ratio in the supernatant fraction were compared with the changes in Glu-6-P levels described in Fig. 1, and these two parameters are shown to be tightly correlated (Fig. 9). The same correlation also holds true for the enzyme present in the 10,000 × g pellet (data not shown) Thus, G6Pase overexpression reduces the amount of glycogen synthase that is in an active state, a change that is well correlated with the intracellular level of Glu-6-P.Figure 9Correlation between glycogen synthase activity ratio and Glu-6-P levels. Glu-6-P levels measured in Fig.1 were plotted against the glycogen synthase activity ratio values achieved at the same glucose concentration measured in the 10,000 × g supernatant fraction. □, AdCMV-G6Pase-treated hepatocytes; ▪, untreated hepatocytes. The regression coefficient was 0.98 for the plot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we have investigated the metabolic impact of overexpression of the catalytic subunit of G6Pase in cultured rat hepatocytes. The motivation for this work was to address two fundamental issues. First, a significant body of evidence, beginning with the study of Ciudad et al. (8Ciudad C.J. Carabaza A. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), has accumulated in support of the notion that a glucose-induced increase in Glu-6-P levels is an essential event for the activation of glycogen synthase and thus glycogen deposition. This implies that maneuvers designed to specifically lower Glu-6-P levels will block the activation of glycogen synthase during glucose stimulation of hepatocytes leading to a decrease in glycogen synthesis, but this idea had never been tested prior to this study. Second, studies in a variety of animal models of diabetes have led to the suggestion that lowering of the glucokinase:G6Pase enzyme activity ratio, whether by a decrease in glucokinase, an increase in G6Pase, or some combination of the two, will cause an increase in hepatic glucose output and contribute to the etiology of diabetes (11Burchell A. Cain D.I. Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Barzilai N. Rossetti L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9871-9874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, to date it had not been possible to isolate the effect of overexpression of the catalytic subunit of G6Pase on glucose utilization and storage and hepatic glucose production. This has been accomplished in the current study by use of the recombinant adenovirus system for expression of G6Pase in isolated hepatocytes, a maneuver that did not alter the glucose phosphorylating capacity. With regard to the first issue raised, our results provide fresh insight into the role of Glu-6-P in the control of glycogen synthase activity and glycogen synthesis. In previous work, we demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of glucokinase in hepatocytes caused a large glucose concentration-dependent increase in Glu-6-P levels relative to untreated control hepatocytes. The increase in Glu-6-P was tightly correlated with large increases in the activation state of glycogen synthase and the amount of glycogen synthesized (15Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M.

When Glu-6-P levels are decreased by overexpression of G6Pase, glycogen synthase is less active and the synthesis of glycogen is greatly diminished. The effect of G6Pase on glycogen synthase activity state and glycogen synthesis is tightly correlated with the concentration of Glu-6-P. Further, these studies define a threshold level of Glu-6-P for activation of glycogen synthase, since the enzyme is not active at Glu-6-P concentrations of less than 0.2 mm. As has been shown in vivo, the glycogen synthase activation system seems to be exquisitely sensitive to changes in Glu-6-P intracellular concentration in the range 0.2–0.3 mm (9Fernández-Novell J.M. Roca A. Bellido D. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We conclude that the reduction in glycogen synthesis that occurs in response to overexpression of the G6Pase catalytic subunit does not appear to be a result of decreased substrate availability but rather is a function of the regulatory effects of Glu-6-P on glycogen synthase activation state. This statement is partly based on our finding that the levels of the immediate precursor for glycogen synthesis, UDP-glucose, were the same in control and AdCMV-G6Pase-treated hepatocytes at all glucose concentrations used in this study. These experiments also suggest that the main role of Glu-6-P in the liver is to trigger the permanent activation of glycogen synthase by favoring its dephosphorylation. In vitro studies have shown that Glu-6-P binding to glycogen synthase, in addition to causing allosteric activation of the enzyme, renders it more susceptible to dephosphorylation and covalent activation by purified phosphatases 1 and 2A (33Villar-Palası́ C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1244: 203-208Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, we may postulate the following mechanism: the binding of Glu-6-P to glycogen synthase alters its structure in a way that facilitates the covalent dephosphorylation and activation of the enzyme. This produces changes in the glycogen synthase activation state, which are is responsible for the enhanced glycogen synthesis. The capacity of Glu-6-P to activate the enzyme through the allosteric mechanism probably plays a minor, transient role, since at the same time that the enzyme is allosterically activated it is rapidly fixed into a more active, less phosphorylated state, by the action of phosphatases. Classically, there is debate as to whether the stimulation of the synthesis of glycogen in the liver is brought about by a 舠pull舡 (34Hers H.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 167-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) or by a 舠push舡 (35El-Refai M. Bergman R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1976; 231: 1608-1619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mechanism. According to the pull mechanism, glucose administration provokes a sequential inactivation of phosphorylase and activation of synthase, with the latter activation decreasing Glu-6-P and UDP-glucose levels as a result of a pull into glycogen. The push mechanism is based on a simulated metabolic model. It predicts that glucose induces glycogen deposition by a mechanism independent of synthase activation but requiring an increase in Glu-6-P and ultimately in UDP-glucose concentrations. Our results indicate that hepatic glycogenesis occurs by a combination of these two mechanisms. It can be considered that glycogen synthesis is a pull process in the sense that the activation of glycogen synthase, by covalent dephosphorylation, stimulates the incorporation of glucosyl units from UDP-glucose into glycogen. The push comes from the increase in intracellular concentration of Glu-6-P in response to glucose, which triggers the covalent activation of glycogen synthase. When, as in the G6Pase-overexpressing cell, Glu-6-P levels decrease, protein phosphatases are less able to dephosphorylate glycogen synthase, and the enzyme remains in a lower activation state. The net result is that less glycogen can be synthesized. With regard to the second issue raised, overproduction of glucose by the liver is a major cause of fasting hyperglycemia in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (13Massillon D. Barzilai N. Chen W. Hu M. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9871-9874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that augmented G6Pase activity may contribute to increased hepatic glucose production and onset of the disease (11Burchell A. Cain D.I. Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Barzilai N. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25019-25025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Massillon D.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Herein we demonstrate that overexpression of the G6Pase catalytic subunit alone is sufficient to markedly reduce glucose utilization and storage and to augment glucose production. Thus it appears that other components of the G6Pase complex such as the glucose-6-phosphate translocase and ER glucose transporter do not prevent an increase in Glu-6-P hydrolysis when the catalytic subunit alone is overexpressed. In addition, we show that by overexpressing G6Pase in cultured hepatocytes, a metabolic pattern is obtained opposite to that encountered in cases of deficient activity of the enzyme. The lack of the catalytic subunit in human patients of glycogen storage disease type 1a or in mice in which the G6Pase gene is knocked out by homologous recombination results in glycogen accumulation in the liver and severe hypoglycemia and lactic acidemia (7Lei K.-J.

Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1994: 935-965Google Scholar). Overexpression of the G6Pase catalytic subunit promotes the reverse situation: a reduction in glycogen synthesis and an increased glucose production from lactate. We conclude that overexpression of G6Pase in hepatocytes has a potent metabolic impact. Cells overexpressing G6Pase accumulate much less glycogen, produce less lactic acid, and are more effective in producing glucose from gluconeogenic substrates than normal cells. These findings are consistent with our recent report showing that 10-fold overexpression of the G6Pase catalytic subunit in the insulinoma cell line INS-1 caused a 4.2-fold increase in3H2O incorporation into glucose, a 327 reduction in glucose usage, and a proportional 307 decrease in insulin secretion (20Trinh K.

Based on these results, it would appear that changes in expression of the G6Pase catalytic subunit reported in liver and islets of various models of diabetes (11Burchell A. Cain D.I.

We have recently adapted the recombinant adenovirus technology for studies in intact animals (38Noel R.J. Newgard C.B. Marshall S.M. Home P.D. Rizza R.A. The Diabetes Annual. 10.

This approach should provide a precise mechanism for altering the expression of G6Pase in liver of whole animals, thereby providing further insight into the role of this enzyme in glucose homeostasis and pathogenesis of diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W1981573425,"Abstract DCC (deleted incolorectal carcinoma) is a broadly expressed cell-surface receptor. Netrin-1 was recently identified as a DCC ligand in brain, but the possibility of other DCC ligands was suggested by the finding that an anti-DCC antibody (clone AF5) neutralized netrin-1-dependent commissural axon outgrowth without blocking DCC/netrin-1 interactions. Here we have searched for alternative cell-surface DCC ligands. A DCC-Ig fusion protein bound to neural and epithelial derived cell lines, indicating that these lines express ligand(s) for DCC. The cell-surface binding activity was mediated by the loop between β-strands F and G of the fifth fibronectin type III repeat FNIII-D5. The loop included the sequence KNRR, which resembles heparin-binding motifs in other proteins. Heparinase and heparitinase treatment of cells reduced binding of DCC-Ig, suggesting that heparan sulfate proteoglycans are cell-surface DCC ligand(s). This was further supported by heparin blocking experiments and by binding of DCC-Ig to immobilized heparan sulfate. The interaction between DCC-Ig and heparan sulfate/heparin, both on the surface of cells and immobilized on plastic, was blocked by the same anti-DCC antibody that blocks netrin-1-dependent commissural axon outgrowth. Taken together, these findings suggest that the DCC-Ig/heparin interaction may contribute to the biological activity of DCC."

Morphine and related opioids have been shown to cause immunological disturbances (1Brown S.M. Stimmel B. Taub R.N. Kochwa S. Rosenfield R.E. Arch. Intern. Med. 1974; 134: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Opioid users are reported to be more susceptible to opportunistic infections than non-users, and they also have a faster progression of disease after infection with the AIDS virus (1Brown S.M. Stimmel B. Taub R.N. Kochwa S. Rosenfield R.E. Arch. Intern. Med. 1974; 134: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 2Donahoe R.M. Falek A. Adv. Biochem.

In a previous study (4Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. In Vivo. 1993; 7: 159-166PubMed Google Scholar) we injected morphine or saline (as a control) to rhesus monkeys and isolated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 1The abbreviations used are: PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; SIV, simian form of HIV. from the animals to assess their T helper cell functions. From those studies, we found that treatment with morphine significantly influenced the ability of the quiescent lymphocytes in nine of eleven monkeys to proliferate. Five of these nine animals showed a transient increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. Furthermore, it was found that at the early stage of morphine administration, a number of animals had a transient enhanced response to mitogens. In addition, four of six morphine-treated monkeys had an elevated interleukin 2 production, ranging from 1.3- to 34-fold increases in stimulation indexes. However, prolonged treatment of these animals with morphine revealed an immunosuppressive effect, and the immunosuppression was naloxone-irreversible (4Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. In Vivo. 1993; 7: 159-166PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggested that morphine receptors may be present on lymphocytic cells, and a cause of opioid tolerance in these monkeys may have been the saturation of these receptors. Recently, evidence has shown that monkey and human immune cells indeed possess brain-like opioid receptors (5Chuang L.F. Chuang T.K. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang A.J. Kung H.-F. Yu L. Chuang R.Y. Biochem.

The present study was undertaken to explore the signaling pathways involved in morphine-induced alteration of T cell function. Because protein phosphorylation represents a major mechanism of signal transduction, we have focused our study on the effects of morphine treatment on protein kinases. Considering the mitogen-like characteristics of morphine (4Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. In Vivo. 1993; 7: 159-166PubMed Google Scholar), we began to investigate the effect of morphine on the levels of various mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in morphine-treated lymphocytes using CEM x174, a human lymphocytic cell line highly susceptible to simian AIDS viral infection. Morphine sulfate was obtained from Mallinckrodt. TRIzol Reagent for protein isolation was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Antibodies to various MAP kinases were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Antibody to the tumor suppressor protein, p53, was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-active MAPK polyclonal antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies used to detect the primary antibodies in the immunoblot (Western blot) assays were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). CEM x174 cells were maintained in suspension cultures at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 107 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin. Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion method. The cells were diluted 1:3 with fresh medium every 3–4 days. 16–24 h after the dilution, CEM x174 cells were treated with morphine sulfate or H2O (as control) for the time periods specified. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline solution, and stored at −20 °C until use. Proteins were isolated from CEM x174 cells using the TRIzol Reagent by a procedure specified by the manufacturer. Samples of 5 or 15 ॖg of protein were analyzed by 107 SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using the Mighty Small II Slab Gel Electrophoresis Unit SE 250 (Hoefer Science Institute, San Francisco, CA). Prestained SDS/PAGE protein standards (Bio-Rad) were run in parallel to reveal the molecular mass of the test proteins. Polypeptide bands resolved in SDS/PAGE gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters, immunoblotted with antibodies to MAP kinases, and detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunocomplexes resolved by electrophoresis were visualized by incubation of the filters with ECL (Amersham Corp.) or the SuperSignal substrate (Pierce) followed by exposure to an autoradiography film NEF (NEN Life Science Products). Results were quantitated by densitometry, and experiments were repeated at least three times. The MAP kinases (MAPKs, also referred to as extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases, or ERKs) are the terminal enzymes in a three-kinase cascade (see Ref. 8Ferrell Jr., J.E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1996; 33: 1-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review). The three kinases are a MAPK kinase kinase (or MEKK) that activates a MAPK kinase (or MEK) which, in turn, activates a MAPK/ERK enzyme (Fig. 1). This MAPK superfamily of enzymes is a critical component of a central switchboard that coordinates incoming signals generated by a variety of extracellular and intracellular mediators. Specific phosphorylation and activation of enzymes in the MAPK module transmits the signal down the cascade and results in the phosphorylation of many proteins with substantial regulatory functions throughout the cell. These include other protein kinases or transcription factors that subsequently control the expression and function of many cellular and nuclear genes (8Ferrell Jr., J.E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1996; 33: 1-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERK1 (44 kDa) and ERK2 (42 kDa) were the first members of the MAPK subfamily whose cDNAs have been cloned (9Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D.

In addition, the signaling cascades that lead to their activation are the best characterized to date (8Ferrell Jr., J.E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1996; 33: 1-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies showed that the syntheses of these two protein kinases were significantly enhanced in morphine-treated CEM x174 cells. Results of a representative experiment were shown in Fig. 2. A 2.18-fold increase and a 1.58-fold increase in the amounts of ERK1 and ERK2 were observed at 12 and 42 h post-morphine treatment, respectively (Fig. 2). In addition to ERK1 and ERK2, a 54-kDa ERK and a 85-kDa MAP kinase could also be identified in the CEM x174 cells. The presence of a 62-kDa MAPK (ERK3), which is expressed in high abundance in the nervous system (12Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A.

The results (Fig.4) showed that morphine indeed activated MAP kinases by increasing the cellular concentration of the active (phosphorylated) form of the enzyme in a time-dependent (Fig. 4 A) and naloxone-reversible (Fig. 4 B) manner. These studies indicated that morphine induced both the active and basal forms of ERK enzymes. These findings suggest that activation of MAP kinases is one of the signaling pathways morphine uses to modulate a variety of cellular and nuclear events in immune cells. The finding that immune cells contain opioid receptors, just like the neuronal cells (5Chuang L.F. Chuang T.K. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang A.J. Kung H.-F. Yu L. Chuang R.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

CEM x174, a human T and B hybrid cell line susceptible to SIV infection, was used for this analysis. Because protein phosphorylation represents a major mechanism of signal transduction, we have focused our studies on the effects of morphine on G-protein-regulated protein kinases. Previously we have found that administration of morphine to monkeys may cause an activation of monkey lymphocytes, an effect similar to that of 舠mitogens舡 (4Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. In Vivo. 1993; 7: 159-166PubMed Google Scholar). We thus initiated the study by assaying the amounts of various MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinases in morphine-treated CEM x174 cells and found that morphine caused a time-dependent and naloxone-reversible activation of MAP kinase module. This suggests that morphine, as an extracellular signal, may trigger initial events upon association with its cell surface receptors (possibly ॖ receptors due to naloxone antagonist effects), and this signal is then transmitted to the interior of the cell, where it activates various cellular and nuclear events as illustrated in Fig.1. Drug abuse has been identified as a significant factor contributing to the AIDS epidemic. It has been recognized (21Schnittman S.M. Psallidopoulos M.C. Lane H.C. Thompson L. Baseler M. Massari F. Fox C.H. Salzman N.P. Fauci A.S. Science. 1989; 245: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) that T helper/inducer lymphocytes of the CD4+ phenotype are the primary target cells of HIV. To assess a possible primary opiate effect on the immune system, Peterson et al. (22Peterson P.K. Sharp B.M. Gekker G. Portoghese P.S. Sannerud K. Balfour Jr., H.H. AIDS. 1990; 4: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) studied HIV-infected human PBMCs and found that morphine promoted the growth of HIV-1 and the effect of morphine could be blocked by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Using SIV, a simian form of HIV, we found that morphine also stimulated SIV replication both in CEM x174 cells (23Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1165-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and in the PBMCs of morphine-treated monkeys (3Chuang L.F. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang R.Y. Addiction Biol. 1997; 2: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because activation of T cells is a prerequisite for HIV/SIV infection (24Gowda S.D. Stein B.S. Mohagheghpour N. Benike C.J. Engleman E.G. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 773-780PubMed Google Scholar), the morphine-induced mitogenic effect, as revealed by the present study, may be an underlying mechanism for the induced virus replication seen in morphine-treated human or animal cells."

The most widely used glycoamidases are those from Flavobacterium meningosepticum (glycoamidase F or PNGase F) and almond emulsin (glycoamidase A or PNGase A). To study the substrate structure requirement of these enzymes systematically, we synthesized >30 glycopeptides containing cellobiose, lactose, GlcNAc, and di-N,N′-acetylchitobiose (CTB). The length of the peptide was varied from one to five amino acids, and glycosylamines were linked to either Asn or Gln located at different positions in the peptide, including NH2 and COOH termini. Neither enzyme could cleave cellobiose and lactose glycopeptides, indicating that the 2-acetamido group on the Asn-linked GlcNAc is important in the recognition by both glycoamidases A and F. GlcNAc peptides could be cleaved by both enzymes, albeit not as effectively as CTB glycopeptides. Neither enzyme requires the Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr) sequence (required for N-glycosylation) for activity. Glycoamidase A could even hydrolyze a Gln-bound CTB glycopeptide, whereas the action of glycoamidase F on this substrate is minimal. While glycoamidase A could act on CTB dipeptides, glycoamidase F preferred a tripeptide or longer.

Glycoamidase (peptide-N 4-(N-acetyl-ॆ-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase, EC 3.5.1.52; also known as peptide N-glycanase) is a special amidase that releases N-linked oligosaccharides from glycopeptides and/or glycoproteins by hydrolyzing the ॆ-amide bond of the asparagine side chain (1Takahashi N. Takahashi N. Muramatsu T. Handbook of Endoglycosidases and Glycoamidases. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 183-198Google Scholar). Since the first discovery of glycoamidase from almond emulsin (glycoamidase A) by Takahashi (2Takahashi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 777-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Although the biological function of the enzyme is increasingly attracting attention, the most popular use of the enzyme currently remains to be de-N-glycosylation of glycoproteins/glycopeptides, most often for structural elucidation of glycoconjugates (15Hirani S.

Handbook of Endoglycosidases and Glycoamidases. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 199-332Google Scholar). The commercially available glycoamidases are from sweet almond (glycoamidase A) (2Takahashi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10700-10704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both enzymes act on all three types of N-linked oligosaccharide chain,i.e. high mannose, hybrid, and complex types (17Plummer Jr., T.H. Tarentino A.L. J. Biol.

However, the N-glycoside chain with a Fuc(α1,3)GlcNAc-Asn segment, found in glycoproteins from plants and insects (19Ishihara H. Takahashi N. Oguri S. Tejima S. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1991; 199: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). It is also acknowledged that a certain length of peptide is needed for the enzyme activities of both enzymes. Recently, Altmann et al.(24Altmann F. Schweiszer S. Weber C. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed, by stepwise degradation of a biantennary glycopeptide with exoglycosidases, that the size of the carbohydrate moiety in the substrate has little influence on the enzyme activities of both glycoamidases and that the hydrolysis rates of both enzymes may be primarily determined by the length of the peptide. However, the glycopeptides used in this study contained at least three amino acids, and the glycopeptides with one or two amino acids were not studied.To study the influence of the length and sequence of the peptide part on the glycoamidase activity, we synthesized four series of glycopeptides, with each series containing cellobiose, 1All sugars used were of thed-configuration. 1All sugars used were of thed-configuration.lactose, GlcNAc, or di-N,N′-acetylchitobiose and containing one to five amino acids with the sugar attached to either Asn or Gln.

Chem. 1990; 9: 777-781Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and then converted to per-O-acetylcellobiosyl azide (34) by reacting with NaN3. The azide 34 was reduced to 35 by hydrogenation and subsequently condensed with Boc-Asp-O-Bzl to provide 36. The expected ॆ-anomeric configuration of cellobiosyl linkage was confirmed by1H NMR (J 1,2 = 7.8 Hz) in CDCl3. Compound 36 was de-O-benzylated and coupled withH-Ala-O-Bzl to give a dipeptide derivative (37), which was de-O-benzylated and condensed with H-Ser-OMe to yield a cellobiose tripeptide (38). De-O-acetylation of 36,37, and 38 by the Zemplén procedure afforded 1, 2, and 3 in quantitative yields. Cellobiose (4) and lactose (8) pentapeptides were prepared by Method B described below. Synthesis of lactose glycopeptides was based on the same strategy as shown in SchemeFS1.Synthesis of GlcNAc- and CTB-containing GlycopeptidesGlcNAc and CTB glycopeptides were synthesized by either of the following two procedures, as exemplified by the CTB glycopeptides.Method A (Stepwise Elongation)This synthetic strategy for CTB glycopeptides is summarized in SchemeFS2. Di-N,N′-acetylchitobiose (39) was per-O-acetylated in pyridine, and then the isolated crystalline peracetate (40) was converted to glycosyl azide (42) via its oxazoline derivative (41) according to a published method (30Nishimura S.-I. Kuzuhara H. Takiguchi Y. Shimahara K. Carbohydr. Res. 1989; 194: 223-231Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Compound 42 was reduced to chitobiosylamine (43) by hydrogenation and subsequently condensed with Boc-Asp-O-Bzl to provide 44. Compound 44 served as the building block for synthesis of various CTB glycopeptides. A stepwise elongation strategy by cycles of COOH- or NH2-terminal deprotection and condensation with the desired amino acids followed by de-O-acetylation with methanolic ammonia led to a series of CTB glycopeptides.Figure FS2Synthesis of CTB glycopeptides.Unless otherwise specified, GN and GN′ denote ॆ-GlcNAc and ॆ-GlcNAc(OAc)3, respectively. i: Ac2O, pyridine, 4 h; ii: trimethylsilyltrifluoromethanesulfonate, CH2Cl2, 50 °C, 5 h; iii: trimethylsilyl-N3, SnCl4, CH2Cl2, 24 h; iv: H2, palladium/carbon, CHCl3/EtOH (1:3), 6 h; v: 2-ethoxy-1-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline, CHCl3/EtOH (10:1), 18 h; vi: a), H2, palladium/carbon, CHCl3/EtOH (1:3), 4 h; b), DCC, HOBt, Et3N, DMF, 18 h; vii: NaOMe, MeOH, 2 h; viii: a), 4 mHCl/dioxane, dioxane, 0.5 h; and b), DCC, HOBt, Et3N, DMF, 18 h.

Open table in a new tab 1) Neither glycoamidase A nor F can hydrolyze any of the lactose and cellobiose glycopeptides. 2) When the carbohydrate is linked to a single amino acid (Asn or Gln), neither enzyme can hydrolyze such glycopeptides, even when both α-NH2 and α-COOH groups are masked. A natural glycopeptide containing only Asn (i.e.Man9-GlcNAc2-Asn) could not be hydrolyzed either. 3) Glycopeptides containing only a single GlcNAc can be cleaved by both enzymes, albeit not as effectively as CTB peptides. Fig.1 (A and B) shows examples of GlcNAc release from Cbz-(GlcNAc)-Asn-Ala-Thr-OMe (11) by glycoamidases A and F, respectively. Hydrolysis of the GlcNAc peptide (13) by glycoamidase F was considerably slower (3.37) than that of the corresponding CTB peptide (27) (987). 4) The length and the nature of the peptide affect the hydrolysis by both enzymes. The CTB pentapeptide (27) was totally hydrolyzed by both enzymes under the conditions described for Table III. However, the rate of hydrolysis of CTB dipeptides by glycoamidase A varied considerably, depending on the position and the type of amino acids. CTB dipeptides with Asn at the COOH terminus (17 and 18) were much poorer substrates than the dipeptides with Asn at the NH2 terminus (16 and 19). The contrast between 18and 19 is especially striking; the reversal in the order of Asn and Phe caused the extent of hydrolysis to drop from 1007 (Asn-Phe) to 9.27 (Phe-Asn). Among the glycotripeptides, the presence of Gly at the COOH terminus seems to lower the hydrolysis rate. This is true for both enzymes and for both the GlcNAc peptide (12) and the CTB tripeptide (22). Both enzymes could hydrolyze Gln glycopeptides (Fig. 1 C), but at diminished rates (compare 27 versus 31 and 20 versus 30). 5) The consensus sequence forN-glycosylation is not required by either enzyme (Fig.1 D). 6) Glycoamidase F tends to work more sluggishly than glycoamidase A (Fig. 2, compareA and B).Figure 1Determination of glycoamidase digestion of glycopeptides.

The chromatograms shown in C and D were obtained by subtraction of the chromatogram of substrate alone from those obtained from the reaction mixture. Therefore, the hydrolytic product appeared as a peak, and the digested substrate formed a negative peak.

Although the biological function of the enzyme is increasingly attracting attention, the most popular use of the enzyme currently remains to be de-N-glycosylation of glycoproteins/glycopeptides, most often for structural elucidation of glycoconjugates (15Hirani S.

However, the glycopeptides used in this study contained at least three amino acids, and the glycopeptides with one or two amino acids were not studied.

This study addresses the role played by the activated insulin receptor within hepatic endosomes and provides evidence for its central role in insulin-stimulated events in vivo. Rats were treated with chloroquine, an acidotrophic agent that has been shown previously to inhibit endosomal insulin degradation, and then with insulin. Livers were removed and fractionated by density gradient centrifugation to obtain endosomal and plasma membrane preparations. Chloroquine treatment increased the amount of receptor-bound insulin in endosomes at 2 min after insulin injection by 937 as determined by exclusion from G-50 columns and by 907 as determined by polyethylene glycol precipitation (p < 0.02). Chloroquine treatment also increased the insulin receptor content of endosomes after insulin injection (integrated over 0–45 min) by 317 when compared with controls (p < 0.05). Similarly, chloroquine increased both insulin receptor phosphotyrosine content and its exogenous tyrosine kinase activity after insulin injection (647;p < 0.01 and 967 and p < 0.001, respectively). In vivo chloroquine treatment was without any observable effect on insulin binding to plasma membrane insulin receptors, nor did it augment insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation or kinase activity in the plasma membrane. Concomitant with its effects on endosomal insulin receptors, chloroquine treatment augmented insulin-stimulated incorporation of glucose into glycogen in diaphragm (p < 0.001). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that chloroquine-dependent inhibition of endosomal insulin receptor dissociation and subsequent degradation prolongs the half-life of the active endosomal receptor and potentiates insulin signaling from this compartment.

This effect does not rely solely on the acidotrophic nature of chloroquine (whereby it is accumulated within acidic vesicles neutralizing the pH; Ref. 23De Duve C.C. De Barsy T. Poole B. Trouet A. Tulkens P. Van Hoof F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 2495-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar), as chloroquine's inhibition of insulin degradation persists in detergent disrupted endosomes (13Pease R.J. Smith G.D.

Biochem. 1989; 181: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of the rates of endosomal insulin degradation in the absence of chloroquine show it to be a bi-exponential process where the values of the rate constants are very similar to those for the dissociation of insulin from its receptor (21Smith G.D. Christensen J.R. Rideout J.M. Peters T.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that dissociation from the receptor is the rate-limiting step in degradation. Chloroquine results in a 2-fold decrease in the rate constant of the slow process, together with an increase in the proportion of degradation proceeding via the slow process (21Smith G.D. Christensen J.R. Rideout J.M. Peters T.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24Christensen J.R. Smith G.D. Peters T.J. Biochem. Soc.

Modeling of insulin binding to purified plasma membranes in the presence of chloroquine demonstrated that the augmentation of binding was due to a decrease in the rate constant for insulin dissociation (28Bevan A.P. Christensen J.R. Tikerpae J. Smith G.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Clinical manifestations of chloroquine action have also been observed. Thus, in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chloroquine improves glucose tolerance (29Smith G.D. Amos T.A.S. Mahler R. Peters T.J. Br. Med. J. 1987; 294: 465-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), increases peripheral glucose disposal, and decreases the metabolic clearance rate of insulin (30Powrie J.K. Smith G.D. Shojaee-Moradie F. Sonksen P.H. Jones R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: E897-E904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chloroquine has been shown to reduce insulin resistance (31Blazar B.R. Whitlet C.B. Kitabchi A.E. Tsai M.Y. Santiago J. White N. Stentz F.B. Brown D.M.

This augmentation of insulin-receptor interaction observed with chloroquine treatment prompted the present study to ascertain whetherin vivo chloroquine treatment in the rat: 1) increases the amount of insulin bound to endosomal insulin receptors, 2) inhibits dissociation and hence degradation of insulin within endosomes, 3) augments and/or prolongs the autophosphorylation state and activity of the endosomal insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, 4) affects the temporal flux of insulin receptors through the endosome compartment, and 5) augments insulin-stimulated metabolic events.

A 10-ml aliquot of homogenate was layered onto a discontinuous gradient of 11 ml ρ = 1.09 g·cm−3 (0.67 m) and 12 ml ρ = 1.14 g·cm−3 (1.05 m) sucrose in 33-ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged in a Sorvall AH-629 swing-out rotor (Du Pont) at 110,000 × g av (29,000 rpm, 75 min, 4 °C) in a Sorvall OTD75B centrifuge (Du Pont). Endosomes were collected at the interface of the 1.09 and 1.14 g·cm−3sucrose solutions. In studies where PEG precipitation, HPLC, and gel permeation chromatography of 125I-[A14]insulin were under investigation, endosomes were prepared in homogenization and gradient buffers containing 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), 1 mm1,10-phenanthroline, and 1 mm chloroquine. The homogenization buffer to prepare samples for HPLC analysis additionally contained 60 units/ml bacitracin. Plasma membrane and endosomal fractions (0.5 ml) were solubilized in 0.5 ml of freshly prepared 2 × solubilization buffer (50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 17 Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 30 mm NaF, 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonic fluoride, 2.5 mm benzamidine, 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 1 ॖg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 ॖg/ml antipain: final concentration). After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, the samples were clarified by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 13,000 × g av (12,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C). Tyrosine kinase activity was assessed using a modified microtiter plate immunocapture method as described previously (38Zhang B. Tavare J.M. Ellis L. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 990-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Morgan D.O. Roth R.A. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 1224-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fifty microliters of CT-3 in 20 mmNaHCO3, pH 9.6, at a concentration of 0.5 ॖg/ml was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C in 96-well F16 Maxisorb loose Nunc-immuno microwell module plates. Any unattached antibody was removed with three applications (100 ॖl) of wash buffer (50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.17 BSA, 0.17 Triton X-100, and 0.17 Tween 20). Duplicate solubilized plasma membrane or endosome samples (200 ॖl) were added to wells and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The sample was then aspirated and plates washed three times with ice-cold wash buffer (100 ॖl) and 20 ॖl of kinase reaction mixture applied (130 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 ॖg/ml BSA, 1 mm EGTA, 12 mmMgCl2, 0.2 ॖm FYF, and 74 KBq [γ-32P]ATP). The incubation was terminated after 20 min at room temperature by the addition of 5 ॖl of 2 m HCl.32P-Labeled peptide substrate was captured onto phosphocellulose columns (Spinzyme™, Pierce, Chester, UK) by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 13,000 ×g av (12,000 rpm, 0.5 min, 22 °C). The filter was washed twice with 75 mm phosphoric acid (500 ॖl) and centrifuged as before. Finally, the filter cartridge was removed and counted in 10 ml of scintillation mixture in a Canberra Packard 1500 Tri-Carb liquid scintillation analyzer. Solubilized plasma membrane and endosomes were incubated with microtiter plates as described above in the kinase assay up to the point of kinase reaction mixture addition, except that in the case of phosphotyrosine content estimation, the wells were plated with phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 at a concentration of 1 ॖg/ml instead of CT-3 and the sample volume was 100 ॖl. Following aspiration of the sample and three washes with wash buffer, the bound antibody was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 50 ॖl of binding buffer (100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 120 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 15 mm sodium acetate, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, and 17 BSA) containing 333 Bq of 125I-[A14]insulin. The wells were then aspirated and washed three times with 100 ॖl of PBS, pH 7.4, and the bound insulin released by the addition of 100 ॖl of 0.037 SDS in water for 20 min at room temperature. The 100 ॖl was removed from the wells and counted for radioactivity in an LKB 1282 γ-counter. Following hepatic portal vein injection of 125I-[A14]insulin (1 MBq in 0.5 ml of PBS, 57 RIA-grade BSA), endosomes were prepared by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation as described above. The isolated endosomal population was subsequently washed free of cytosol by a 10-fold dilution in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4 (containing 0.1m KCl, 2.5 mm NEM), and sedimented by centrifugation in a Sorvall T-865.1 rotor at 100,000 ×g av (37,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). The endosomes were solubilized with a final concentration of 0.17 Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 10 min and then clarified by centrifugation in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor at 120,000 × g av (60,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). HPLC separation of extracted endosomal contents was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, in 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, with an acetonitrile gradient. The precise changes in acetonitrile concentration required to effect the separation of degradation intermediates were as follows: 1) 0–5 min at 07, 2) 5–20-min gradient rising to 8.457, 3) instantaneous rise to 28.57, 4) 20–40-min gradient rising to 32.57. Detection of 125I was achieved by an on-line counter attached to a reverse phase HPLC Hypersil-BDS, 5 ॖm, C-18 column, 250 × 4.6 mm, fitted with an additional 10-mm guard cartridge of the same material and purchased from Shandon HPLC (Runcorn, Cheshire, UK). Endosomes containing 125I-[A14]insulin were prepared as described above from animals that had received an injection of125I-[A14]insulin (1 MBq in 0.5 ml of PBS, 57 RIA-grade BSA) via the hepatic portal vein. The endosomes were solubilized with a final concentration of 0.17 Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 10 min and then clarified by centrifugation in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor at 120,000 × g av (60,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). A 0.25-ml aliquot of the supernatant was mixed with 0.5 ml of bovine γ-globulin (1.25 mg/ml PBS, pH 7.4) and 0.5 ml of PEG-6000 (257 in water). The mixture was left for 20 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged in a Jouan KR 422 centrifuge at 3000 ×g av (3200 rpm, 25 min, 4 °C). The pellet was then counted for radioactivity using an LKB 1282 γ-counter. A 0.5-ml aliquot of solubilized endosomes containing 125I-[A14]insulin prepared as above was applied to a Sephadex G-50 column (40 × 1 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 17 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm NEM, 1.0 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 1 mm chloroquine, 0.57 BSA. Elution was achieved with the same buffer, and 1-ml fractions were counted for radioactivity using LKB 1282 γ-counter. Aliquots (250 ॖl) derived from endosomes containing125I-[A14]insulin were added to 500 ॖl of ice-cold 207 trichloroacetic acid and incubated on ice for 10 min prior to centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 13,000 ×g av (12,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C). The pellet and supernatant were then counted for radioactivity using an LKB 1282 γ-counter. Animals were treated with either PBS or chloroquine as described above prior to a 0.15 ॖg/100 g body weight insulin injection via the jugular vein, which also contained [14C]glucose (46.3 KBq/100 g body weight). One hour later, the animals were sacrificed, and their diaphragms excised, rinsed in ice-cold PBS and blotted dry prior to weighing. The extent of [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen was determined by the method of Rafaelsen et al. (40Rafaelsen O.J. Lauris V. Renold A.E. Diabetes. 1965; 14: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined by a Coomassie Blue dye binding kit (Pierce) using BSA as standard. Analyses were performed using the statistical program SPSS version 7. For all data sets, it was first determined that the data was normally distributed and that the variances were equal. These criteria were satisfied in all cases allowing the use of Student's t test to analyze for significant differences. Differences in integrated response curves were tested by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (41Armitage P. Berry G. Statistical Methods in Medical Research. Blackwell Scientific Publishers, Oxford1987Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that hepatic insulin degradation in vivo occurs within endosomes (12Pease R.J. Smith G.D. Peters T.J. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with dissociation of insulin from the receptor being a prerequisite for this process to occur (14Doherty J.J. Kay D.G. Lai W.H. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Desbuquois B. Lopez S. Janicot M. Burlet H. de Galle B. Fouque F. Diabete Metab. 1992; 18: 104-112PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the percentage of insulin in endosomes that is receptor-bound, rats were administered 125I-[A14]insulin via the hepatic portal vein and hepatic endosomes freshly isolated. Fig.1 shows the elution profile from a G-50 gel permeation column of material generated from solubilized hepatic endosomes. The first peak represents receptor-bound insulin, which is size-excluded from the column and elutes in the void volume. This comprised 18.57 of the total. The amount of receptor-bound insulin was confirmed by an independent method of assessment, namely PEG precipitation of the insulin-receptor complex (19.27; TableI). The remaining 807 of the insulin eluted in the second peak from the G-50 column and comprised dissociated insulin, of which 86.37 remains intact as assessed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (Table I). Thus, after insulin injection, 2 min of in vivo processing time, and endosome preparation time, 807 of endocytosed insulin has already dissociated from its receptor and is accessible for intra-endosomal degradation.Table IEffect of chloroquine on insulin-receptor interactions and inhibition of endosomal insulin degradation in vivoTreatmentTrichloroacetic acid precipitabilityPEG precipitabilitySepharose G-50 chromatography777(−) Inhibitors86.3 ± 5.519.2 ± 2.718.5(−) Chloroquine(+) Inhibitors97.5 ± 0.427.7 ± 1.629.7(−) Chloroquine(+) Inhibitors98.9 ± 0.252.6 ± 4.1*57.3(+) ChloroquineAnesthetized rats were injected with approximately 1 MBq of125I-[A14]insulin via the hepatic portal vein over 30 s.

Changes upon heat shock in phosphorylation, leading to inactivation, of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) eIF2 and eIF4E have been shown for several cell types. However, in mammalian cells these changes occur at temperatures of 43 °C or higher while protein synthesis is already affected at milder heat shock temperatures. In searching for the cause for the inhibition of protein synthesis, the regulation of eIF2 and eIF4E by additional factors was analyzed. In this respect, the activity of eIF2B was measured during and after heat shock. A very clear correlation was found between the activity of this guanine exchange factor and the levels of protein synthesis, also at mild heat shock conditions. Changes in the phosphorylation of eIF4E and of the eIF4E-binding protein PHAS-I were also analyzed. Surprisingly, in H35 cells as well as in some other cell lines, PHAS-I phosphorylation was increased by heat shock, whereas in others it was decreased. Therefore, decreasing the eIF4E availability under stressful conditions does not seem to be a general mechanism to inhibit protein synthesis by heat shock. Regulation of eIF2B activity appears to be the main mechanism to control translation initiation after heat shock at mild temperatures.

Regulation of eIF2B activity appears to be the main mechanism to control translation initiation after heat shock at mild temperatures. Incubating mammalian cells at elevated temperatures inhibits the translation of mRNAs (1Hickey E.D. Weber L.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 2Nover L.

The translational lesion in heat-shocked cells principally occurs at the initiation step of translation (1, 5–7; for review, see Ref. 8Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In the initiation process, the 7-methyl guanosine cap at the 5′ end of the mRNA is bound by a complex of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), 1The abbreviations used are:eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; 4E-BP, eIF4E-binding protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ISB, isoelectric focusing buffer; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; LSB, Laemmli sample buffer; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CIP, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. 1The abbreviations used are:eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; 4E-BP, eIF4E-binding protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ISB, isoelectric focusing buffer; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; LSB, Laemmli sample buffer; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CIP, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. including the cap-binding protein eIF4E and the RNA helicase eIF4A. Unwinding of the RNA enables recognition of the AUG initiation codon by the 43 S ribosomal complex and delivery of initiator methionyl tRNA. Then the large ribosomal subunit joins the complex, and peptide synthesis begins (8Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Both the concentration and activity of protein synthesis initiation factors and the primary sequence of the 5′-untranslated region of an mRNA can affect the rates of eukaryotic translation initiation. With respect to the heat shock-induced modifications of eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factors, it is of interest that the activity of many initiation factors can be regulated by phosphorylation. It has been shown that changes in the phosphorylation state of various of these eukaryotic initiation factors, such as eIF2, eIF2B, eIF4B, and eIF4E, could coincide with changes in protein synthesis (9Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 10Redpath N.T. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The proteins eIF2 and eIF2B act to bring Met-tRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit: eIF2 by binding to Met-tRNA and GTP, and eIF2B by replacing GDP on eIF2 for GTP. Previous studies from several laboratories have focused on heat shock-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α (11Ernst V. Baum E.Z. Reddy P. Schlesinger M. Ashburner M. Tissieres A. Heat Shock From Bacteria to Man. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor1982: 215-225Google Scholar, 12De Benedetti A. Baglioni C. J. Biol.

However, it was found that less severe heat shocks that inhibit protein synthesis by more than 707 do not elicit this phosphorylation. Duncan and Hershey (13Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1467-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) suggested that eIF2B might be a key player in the inhibition of protein synthesis under mild heat shock conditions. In this paper, we have studied the effect of heat shock temperatures in the range of 41–44 °C on eIF2B activity. Phosphorylation of eIF4E appears to be required for efficient cap binding and formation of the 48 S preinitiation complex (14Hiremath L.S. Hiremath S.T. Rychlik W. Joshi S. Domier L.L. Rhoads R.E. J.

A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that heat shock leads to eIF4E dephosphorylation in various cell types (13Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1467-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol.

Cavener D.R. Qu S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2985-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, in mammalian cells this phenomenon of dephosphorylation, similar to phosphorylation of eIF2α, mainly occurs at temperatures of 43 °C or higher while protein synthesis is inhibited already at lower temperatures (13Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1467-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore, eIF4E dephosphorylation cannot be the main determinant of the inhibition of protein synthesis as induced by heat shock. However, alternative types of regulation of eIF4E activity that could be involved in the decrease of protein synthesis in heat-shocked cells have become available by recent studies, using growth factors and insulin to stimulate protein synthesis. Besides phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of eIF4E, eIF4E activity can be regulated through eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) (20Lin T.-A. Kong S. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 21Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). The 4E-BPs compete for a binding site on eIF4E with eIF4G, the largest subunit of the eIF4F cap-binding complex (22Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the 4E-BPs to eIF4E is regulated by phosphorylation of the binding proteins; enhanced phosphorylation leads to dissociation of the eIF4E·4E-BP complex, increasing the amount of eIF4E available for eIF4F formation (21Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 24Hu C. Pang S. Kong X. Velleca M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We have studied the effects of heat shock on one of the 4E-BPs, PHAS-I, or 4E-BP1. The strong changes in protein synthesis during mild heat shock of H35-Reuber hepatoma cells are associated with the rapid inactivation of eIF2B while an unexpected phosphorylation of PHAS-I was measured due to heat shock. This suggests that at these temperatures protein synthesis is mainly regulated by this eIF2B, and not by the activity of cap-binding complexes. Rat hepatoma Reuber H35 cells were grown in Leibowitz (L15) medium (Flow/ICN Laboratories) containing potassium penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 ॖg/ml), and 107 fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown in 25 cm2 flasks to a confluency of 80–907. In some experiments, rat pheochromocytoma PC12, Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts CCL39, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or mouse A14 cells, derived from NIH-3T3 cells, that overexpress the insulin receptor (25Burgering B.M.T.

PC12 cells were grown in DMEM and HAM's F12 1:1 (DF medium) with 7.57 serum. A14 and CHO cells were grown in DMEM containing 7.57 serum and CCL39 cells in DMEM with 57 serum. Heat shocks were applied by submerging the culture flasks in a heated waterbath that provides a temperature stable within 0.1 °C (S.E.). Under these conditions, temperature equilibration of the cells took about 0.5 min. Cell labeling was carried out with 7 ॖCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Promix, Amersham) in 2 ml of HEPES-buffered DMEM lacking methionine. After harvesting of the cells, 107 of the sample to determine [35S]methionine/cysteine incorporation by hot-TCA precipitation. eIF2·[3H]GDP complexes were made as described (26Mehta H. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3438-3441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 pmol eIF2 was incubated with 0.2 ॖCi of [3H]GDP (∼15 pmol, 30,000 dpm/pmol) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 120 mm KCl, 17 bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, and cell extract (prepared as described below) was added. Cells were harvested in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 17 Triton X-100, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm ॆ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 107 glycerol, 4 ॖg of leupeptin/ml, 0.2 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, and 7 mmॆ-mercaptoethanol. Cell extracts, approximately 10 ॖg total protein, were added to eIF2·[3H]GDP complexes and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The GDP-GTP exchange reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of a cold wash buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 7 mm ॆ-mercaptoethanol). The mixture was filtered through nitrocellulose filters and washed three times with the same buffer. Activity of eIF2B was determined by quantification of the amount of eIF2·[3H]GDP retained on the filter. Cells were harvested in 75 ॖl of the buffer used for determination of eIF2B activity. 2 ॖl of these samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Monoclonal antibodies against eIF2α were used to visualize the total amount of eIF2α while the amount of phosphorylated eIF2α was determined with a polyclonal antibody, which was raised against an eIF2α peptide containing a phosphorylated serine residue. This antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Gary Krause. Cells were harvested in 75 ॖl of isoelectric focusing buffer (ISB) (9.5m urea (Life Technologies, Inc.), 12 mm CHAPS (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.757 Biolytes 3/10, 2.257 Biolytes 4/6 (Bio-Rad), and 700 mm ॆ-mercaptoethanol). One-third of each sample was subjected to denaturing one-dimensional isoelectric focusing as described (27Kleijn M. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of eIF4E were visualized with a polyclonal antibody and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were harvested in 75 ॖl of either Laemmli sample buffer (LSB) or in ISB. The ISB samples were diluted with LSB prior to loading onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Approximately 157 of each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (13.57). PHAS-I isoforms (20Lin T.-A. Kong S. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C.

For dephosphorylation of PHAS-I with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIP), cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA, quickly washed with 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ZnCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and resuspended in the same buffer followed by 3 freeze-thawing cycles. The lysed cells were incubated with 1 unit of CIP at 37 °C for 1 h, and at 56 °C for 1 h after addition of another unit of CIP. Cell flasks were harvested in 50 ॖl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 17 Triton X-100, 50 mm glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 4 ॖg of leupeptin/ml, 0.2 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 7 mm ॆ-mercaptoethanol, and 107 glycerol). Extracts were diluted 75-fold in buffer A, and 2 ॖl of this dilution (approximately 30 ng of protein) was incubated in 10-ॖl assays containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KAc, 10 mmMgAc2, 4 ॖg of purified rabbit reticulocyte 80 S ribosomes, 100 ॖm [γ-32P]ATP (2200 dpm/pmol specific activity) for 15 min at 30 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of the dried gels. Quantitative data were obtained with a Phosphomager (Molecular Dynamics). This method to measure S6 kinase activity is specific for p70S6K (29Chen R.H. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3204-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Heat shock of cells leads to a rapid decrease in protein synthesis, mainly caused by inhibition of translation initiation processes (2Nover L. Nover L. Heat Shock Response. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 299-324Google Scholar, 7Schamhart D.H.J. van Walraven H.S. Wiegant F.A.C. Linnemans W.A.M. van Rijn J. van den Berg J. van Wijk R. Radiat. Res. 1984; 98: 82-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The subsequent time needed for recovery of protein synthesis is correlated with the duration and severeness of the stress conditions (30Van Wijk R. van Aken H. Schamhart D.H.J. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 1993; 9: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 31Mizzen L.A. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 109: 1467-1481Google Scholar). Rat H35-Reuber hepatoma cells were used to study protein synthesis during and after heat shock and to study the effects of these heat shocks on the activity or phosphorylation of various translation initiation factors. The sensitivity of protein synthesis of H35 cells for exposure to elevated temperatures (range 41–44 °C) and the ability to recover at 37 °C from inhibition of protein synthesis are shown in Fig. 1 A. In these experiments, cells were kept at the indicated temperatures for the appropriate time and incubated with [35S]methionine/cysteine for the last 15 min. All used temperatures caused a rapid and drastic inhibition of protein synthesis of at least 807 when protein synthesis was measured during the last 15 min of the heat shock period. Even stronger inhibition was found 30 min after the stress at 43 and 44 °C while cells that were incubated at 41 or 42 °C already started to recover during this period. Cells that were exposed to mild heat shock temperatures had regained control levels of protein synthesis after 4 h while protein synthesis in cells that were shocked at 43 or 44 °C was still impaired after that time period. Because changes in the activity of GTP-GDP exchange factor eIF2B will influence translation initiation on all mRNAs, this five-subunit complex is a good candidate to be affected by heat shock. Therefore, we have determined whether changes in eIF2B activity coincide with the changes in [35S]methionine/cysteine incorporation after heat shock treatment. eIF2, bound in vitro to [3H]GDP, was added to cell lysates from cells that were heat treated similarly to the samples in Fig. 1 A. Active eIF2B in the cell extracts will exchange the labeled GDP for unlabeled GTP, which can be measured by retention of labeled complexes on nitrocellulose filters. A very good correlation exists between eIF2B activity and overall protein synthesis in heat-shocked H35 cells (Fig. 1 B). The lower heat shock temperatures of 41 and 42 °C caused a rapid and transient inhibition of eIF2B activity of approximately 707. Cells shocked at either 41 or 42 °C showed recovery of eIF2B activity immediately after the heat shock while eIF2B activity in cells exposed to 43 or 44 °C only recovered partially over a 4-h interval. Inactivation of eIF2B can occur by several mechanisms, of which phosphorylation of eIF2α and subsequent sequestering of eIF2B is the best-known. We tried to determine the extent of eIF2α phosphorylation by isoelectric focusing and Western blotting. Although these blots indicated that eIF2α phosphorylation did not occur at the lower temperatures, we could not produce a consistent result. Fortunately, we obtained an antibody from Dr. Gary Krause that specifically recognizes phosphorylated eIF2α. With this antibody, the phosphorylation state of eIF2α after heat shocks at 40.5–44 °C was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig.2, bottom). To show that equal amounts of eIF2 were loaded in the separate lanes, equal amounts of the lysates were analyzed with an antibody that recognizes both forms of eIF2α (top). At 40.5 and 41 °C, no change in eIF2α phosphorylation occurred (lanes 2 and 3) while at 41 °C a major decrease in eIF2B activity was measured (Fig. 1). Further increase of the heat shock temperature resulted in a gradual increase in eIF2α phosphorylation that reached its maximal level at 42.5 °C (lanes 4–6). Phosphorylation of eIF2α was increased approximately 1.8–2.2-fold at temperatures of 41.5 °C and above. As control for the eIF2α-P antibody, purified eIF2 and purified HRI were incubated in the presence of ATP (lane 10), and its phosphorylation state was compared with untreated eIF2 (lane 9). The signal obtained with phosphorylated eIF2α-specific antibodies clearly increased after HRI treatment, showing the specificity of this antibody for the phosphorylated form of eIF2α. The results in Fig. 1 and the literature data imply that levels of protein synthesis in heat-shocked cells are governed by the activity of eIF2B. Whereas no changes were found in other initiation factors, eIF2B activity was already greatly compromised at 41 °C. Interestingly, reduced eIF2B activity, coinciding with decreased protein synthesis, was found without any changes in the eIF2α phosphorylation state. Besides a reduction of protein synthesis, the heat shock response is characterized by the onset of translation of the heat shock mRNAs. Cap-binding proteins are thought to play a role in this process, and, for example in HeLa cells, diminished phosphorylation of eIF4E was found (13Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1467-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, this reduction was found at temperatures of 43 °C and higher. Therefore, we studied the possible involvement of eIF4E-binding proteins in inhibition of protein synthesis of H35 cells. Since cell types show different sensitivities to heat stress, we have first determined whether H35 cells showed similar eIF4E dephosphorylation characteristics as HeLa cells, which have been studied thoroughly (13Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1467-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). After 30 min at 43 and 44 °C eIF4E was almost completely dephosphorylated (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5). No decrease in eIF4E phosphorylation was found at 41 °C (lane 2) while at 42 °C eIF4E phosphorylation was reduced by approximately 507. Nevertheless, the 41 °C did result in a severe inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 1). Reduced protein synthesis at mild heat shock temperatures is apparently not due to dephosphorylation of eIF4E, similar to the results obtained with HeLa cells (13Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1467-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In parallel with changes in the phosphorylation state of eIF4E, the activity of eIF4E can also be controlled by changes in the activity of the eIF4E-binding protein, PHAS-I. Binding of PHAS-I to eIF4E results in reduced availability of eIF4E for eIF4F complex formation, which is needed for cap-dependent translation (32Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The binding activity of PHAS-I is controlled by changes in the phosphorylation state of PHAS-I because the dephosphorylated forms of PHAS-I bind eIF4E more tightly. Therefore, a reduced PHAS-I phosphorylation is expected in heat-shocked cells with inhibited protein synthesis. The distribution of PHAS-I among its phosphorylated forms was determined during heat shock and recovery (Fig. 4 A). Surprisingly, heat shock led to a strong increase in the phosphorylation state of PHAS-I. PHAS-I phosphorylation was increased slightly at 42 °C while at 43 and 44 °C the highly phosphorylated forms of PHAS-I were the predominant forms as compared with the control cells (Fig. 4 A, lane 16). Phosphorylation of PHAS-I continued after the cells were returned to 37 °C (comparelanes 2 and 3, 7 and 8, and12 and 13) while during further recovery dephosphorylation occurred (lanes 4 and 5, and9 and 10). A minor shift from the ॆ-form to the more phosphorylated γ-form was found at 41 °C (not shown). The increase in phosphorylation as well as the time needed for dephosphorylation were correlated with the heat shock temperature. The inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 1) and the enhanced phosphorylation of PHAS-I (Fig. 4 A) in heat-shocked cells is opposite to enhanced phosphorylation of PHAS-I as found after growth factor and insulin stimulation of protein synthesis. This suggests that protein synthesis is not regulated by phosphorylation of PHAS-I under these conditions and that PHAS-I phosphorylation serves other, unknown purposes than regulation of eIF4E availability. To establish the nature of the γ′-form of PHAS-I, that was found at all three temperatures in Fig. 3 A, cell extracts were treated with the alkaline phosphatase CIP (Fig. 4 B). Thus, three forms of PHAS-I were detected in extracts from untreated cells: α, ॆ, and γ (lane 1). In heat-shocked cells, the γ′-form was found (lane 3), as in Fig. 3 A. Treatment of these extracts with CIP resulted in conversion of γ- and γ′-forms to the α- and ॆ-forms of PHAS-I (lanes 2 and4), confirming that γ′-PHAS-I was a phosphorylated form of PHAS-I. The γ′-form of PHAS-I was also detected in insulin-treated rat muscle cells (34Azpiazu I. Saltiel A.R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lawrence Jr J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5033-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The absence of conversion of the phosphorylated ॆ-form (20Lin T.-A. Kong S. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) to the unphosphorylated α-form is not understood. Similar experiments with potato acid phosphatase also failed in dephosphorylating this ॆ-form (not shown). Four other cell lines, A14, CHO, CCL39, and PC12, were used to investigate whether the fourth form of PHAS-I was unique for rat hepatoma H35 cells or whether this highly phosphorylated form was also found in other cells after heat shock (Fig.5). In mouse fibroblastic A14 cells and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, heat shock also resulted in strong phosphorylation of PHAS-I as in H35 cells. Therefore, heat shock-induced phosphorylation of PHAS-I is not restricted to H35 cells but occurs in cell lines from different origins. However, phosphorylation of PHAS-I was not found in two Chinese hamster cell lines, CHO and CCL39, upon heat shock. In these cell lines, dephosphorylation of this eIF4E binding protein occurred. These unexpected results will be discussed later. Phosphorylation of PHAS-I has been correlated with increased protein synthesis after insulin administration (34Azpiazu I. Saltiel A.R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lawrence Jr J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5033-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Under these conditions eIF4E could not longer bind to PHAS-I, making eIF4E available for translation initiation. In contrast, heat shock increased phosphorylation of PHAS-I in H35 cells and severely inhibited protein synthesis (Figs. 1 and4 A). In Fig. 6, we determined whether heat shock induced the dissociation of eIF4E·PHAS-I complexes after heat shock of H35 cells. For comparison, CHO cells were used in which heat shock induced PHAS-I dephosphorylation. H35 and CHO cells were heat-shocked at 44 °C for 30 min and returned to 37 °C for 1 or 6 h after the heat shock. In both cell lines, a decrease of protein synthesis to 10–207 of the control cells was found after heat shock as well as in cells that were replaced at 37 °C for 1 h. After recovery for 6 h, protein synthesis in both cell lines was 70–807 compared with the untreated cells. Apparently, both cell lines have similar kinetics for the levels of protein synthesis after heat shock. Fig. 6 A, top panel, shows the pattern of PHAS-I phosphorylation in the various samples. Heat shock induced a strong increase in PHAS-I phosphorylation (as shown in Fig. 4) immediately after the heat shock (lanes 2 and 3) while a recovery period of 6 h resulted in reduced PHAS-I phosphorylation (lane 4), comparable with the control cells (lane 1). The opposite effect, although less pronounced, was found in CHO cells; heat shock resulted in dephosphorylation of PHAS-I while, after a 6-h recovery period, a slight increase in PHAS-I phosphorylation was detectable. Complexes of eIF4E and PHAS-I from these samples were purified by m7GTP-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Fig.6 A, bottom panel). Similar amounts of eIF4E were recovered in all samples showing that m7GTP-binding activity of eIF4E was not changed drastically due to heat shock (18Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2789-2794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in H35 cells, the ability of PHAS-I to bind eIF4E was dramatically reduced after heat shock (lanes 2 and3). Apparently, phosphorylation of PHAS-I after heat shock (lanes 1 and 2) abolished complex formation between PHAS-I and eIF4E. After the recovery period, in which PHAS-I dephosphorylation occurred, an increase in eIF4E·PHAS-I complex formation was found (lane 4). A strong increase in the binding of PHAS-I to eIF4E was found in CHO cells (lanes 6and 7). The amount of associated PHAS-I after recovery (lane 8) was somewhat higher than expected. Fig. 6 B shows a schematic representation of the quantification of the results in Fig. 6 A. Phosphorylation of PHAS-I (black bars) increased from 37 to 857 in H35 cells, with a concomitant dissociation on eIF4E·PHAS-I complexes (gray bars). In the heat-shocked cells, an approximately 10-fold decrease in PHAS-I binding was found. In the cells that were allowed to recover for 6 h, PHAS-I phosphorylation and its association with eIF4E were similar to the situation found in the non-shocked cells. The approximately 407 dephosphorylation of PHAS-I found after heat shock of CHO cells, resulted in a 7-fold increase of PHAS-I binding to eIF4E. Th"

Activation of LIF-R-gp130 complexes regulates the differentiation and proliferation of a variety of cell lines as well as influencing the behavior of cultured neurons, hepatocytes, and adipocytes (for review see Ref. 22Taga T. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Gene knockout experiments have demonstrated roles for LIF-R in development. LIF-R−/− and CNTFRα−/− mice show a substantial loss of motor neurons (23DeChiara T.M. Vejsada R. Poueymirou W.T. Acheson A. Suri C. Conover J.C. Friedman B. McClain J. Pan L. Stahl N. Ip N.Y. Kato A.

Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1244-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Determining the precise role of LIF-R activation in each of these processes is of considerable clinical interest.An antagonist for all LIF-R ligands would be useful in defining the function of LIF-R in vivo, especially in situations in which the LIF-R ligand has not been identified or more than one is present. Neutralizing the currently known ligands may be insufficient, because novel LIF-R ligands are likely to be identified in the future (23DeChiara T.M. Vejsada R. Poueymirou W.T. Acheson A. Suri C. Conover J.C. Friedman B. McClain J. Pan L. Stahl N. Ip N.Y. Kato A. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). A LIF-R antagonist would also be useful in dissecting OSM responses according to receptor usage and might have therapeutic applications in pathologies such as multiple myeloma (41Zhang X.-G. Gu J.J. Lu Z.Y. Yasukawa K. Yancopoulos G.D. Turner K. Shoyab M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Bataille R. Klein B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1337-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).One approach to designing a LIF-R antagonist is to block the heterodimerization of LIF-R and gp130. Mutant LIF molecules with reduced gp130 binding will occupy LIF-R but will be impaired in receptor complex formation. We recently described the generation of LIF antagonists with reduced affinity for gp130 (42Hudson K.R. Vernallis A.B. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11971-11978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Using binding assays to the purified extracellular domains of human gp130 (hgp130) and human LIF-R (hLIF-R), we showed that the antagonists bound to hLIF-R with wild-type affinity (K D = ∼1 nm (4Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandenBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar,43Layton M.J. Lock P. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17048-17055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) but did not bind detectably to hgp130 (wild type affinity for gp130 is 100–1000-fold lower than to LIF-R (42Hudson K.R. Vernallis A.B. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11971-11978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 44Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J.

Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar)), a finding that is consistent with topologically discrete receptor binding sites. One of the antagonists, hLIF-05, which carries the simultaneous substitution of four residues in the A helix and five residues in the C helix (A117E, D120R, I121K, G124N, S127L, Q25L, S28E, Q32A, and S36K), is free of any residual agonistic activity. In proliferation assays on the Ba/F3-hLIF-R-hgp130 cell line, hLIF-05 showed no stimulatory activity when presented alone and successfully antagonized hLIF when presented at excess to hLIF (42Hudson K.R. Vernallis A.B. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11971-11978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Results presented here demonstrate that hLIF-05 is a true LIF-R antagonist that will antagonize responses to all currently identified LIF-R ligands, including hLIF, murine CT-1 (mCT-1), human CNTF (hCNTF), and human OSM (hOSM). We further show that hLIF-05 discriminates between hLIF-R and human OSM-R (hOSM-R). Receptor phosphorylation assays demonstrate that hLIF-05 blocks tyrosine phosphorylation of hLIF-R and hgp130, which suggests that hLIF-05 blocks receptor activation and signal transduction.DISCUSSIONAntagonists for a variety of four-helical bundle cytokines have been created by allowing high affinity binding to the first receptor subunit while destroying low affinity binding to a sequentially assembled receptor subunit. Examples include both homodimerizing ligands such as growth hormone (62Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and hetero-oligomerizing ligands such as IL-4 (63Tony H.P. Shen B.J. Reusch P. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (64Hercus T.R. Bagley C.J. Cambareri B. Dottore M. Woodcock J.M. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Lopez A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5838-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Within the subgroup of gp130-dependent cytokines, IL-6 antagonists with reduced binding to gp130 (65Ehlers M. de Hon F.D. Bos H.K. Horsten U. Kurapkat G. van De Leur H.S. Grotzinger J. Wollmer A.

Pulkki K. Sun R.-X. Toniatti C. Klein B. Ciliberto G. Blood. 1996; 87: 4510-4519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CNTF antagonists with reduced binding to LIF-R (67Di Marco A. Gloaguen I. Graziani R. Paonessa G. Saggio I. Hudson K.R. Laufer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9247-9252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have been described. IL-6 and CNTF antagonists show narrow specificities because the antagonists retain binding to their respective specificity subunits but do not sequester shared subunits (68de Hon F.D. Ehlers M. Rose-John S. Ebeling S.B. Bos H.K. Aarden L.A. Brakenhoff J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2395-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The broad specificity of hLIF-05 makes it a novel reagent for this family.The high ratio of hLIF-05 to LIF-R ligand required for effective antagonism is not unusual. Although the EC50 for hLIF varied on Ba/F3-hLIF-R-hgp130, the average was 2.5 pm(n = 12), making the cells as sensitive as XG-1 myeloma cells, which have been used as a rigorous test for residual agonism in IL-6 antagonists (68de Hon F.D.

The ratios reported here for Ba/F3-hLIF-R-hgp130 are similar to those required of IL-6 antagonists with reduced gp130 binding (68de Hon F.D. Ehlers M. Rose-John S. Ebeling S.B. Bos H.K. Aarden L.A.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Subsequently, IL-6 antagonists with very high potency were obtained by adding mutations that enhance IL-6 receptor binding (65Ehlers M. de Hon F.D. Bos H.K. Horsten U. Kurapkat G. van De Leur H.S. Grotzinger J. Wollmer A. Brakenhoff J.P. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8158-8163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 66Sporeno E. Savino R. Ciapponi L.

Toniatti C. Delmastro P. Altamura S. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A similar strategy may be applicable to hLIF-05.The EC50 for hLIF on HepG2s (3–4 pm) was within the range observed for Ba/F3-hLIF-R-hgp130 cells, yet a much lower ratio of antagonist to agonist was required for inhibiting hLIF responses on HepG2 cells. Similar cell type-dependent potencies have been documented for other cytokine antagonists (64Hercus T.R. Bagley C.J. Cambareri B. Dottore M. Woodcock J.M. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Lopez A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5838-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 69Savino R. Ciapponi L. Lahm A. Demartis A. Cabibbo A. Toniatti C. Delmastro P. Altamura S. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The complete sparing of the OSM response in HepG2s suggests that activating OSM-R is sufficient for the acute phase response. HepG2 cells may form three times as many OSM-R-gp130 complexes as LIF-R-gp130 complexes (10Thoma B. Bird T.A. Friend D.J. Gearing D.P. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6215-6222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further experiments with hLIF-05 on cell types that are limiting in OSM-R might reveal situations in which both OSM-R and LIF-R are needed for a full response.Although many cytokine antagonists have been described, the immediate receptor events have rarely been documented. A murine IL-4 antagonist has been shown to inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 and STAT6 in Ba/F3 cells (70Grunewald S.M. Kunzmann S. Schnarr B. Ezernieks J. Sebald W. Duschl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1480-1483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). LIF-R and gp130 each has five tyrosine-based motifs that are distal to the membrane-proximal Jak binding domain (71Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). The most distal four of gp130 and the most distal three of LIF-R are all capable of mediating STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (71Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). As demonstrated here, hLIF-05 inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of LIF-R and gp130, so hLIF-05 will block STAT3 recruitment, activation by phosphorylation, and translocation to the nucleus. Blocking STAT3 activation fits with the antagonism observed in both HepG2 and IMR 32 cells. STAT3 plays a key role in the acute phase response, including the stimulation of haptoglobin expression (17Wegenka U.M. Lutticken C. Buschmann J. Yuan J. Lottspeich F. Muller-Esterl W. Schindler C. Roeb E. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3186-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 72Oliviero S. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and in the induction of VIP by LIF-R ligands (73Rajan P. Symes A.J. Fink J.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Altbough we cannot rule out receptor-phosphorylation-independent signaling, the lack of any detectable agonism by hLIF-05 in the three cell types examined argues that hLIF-05 does not itself activate primary signal transduction pathways. The inhibition of receptor phosphorylation further demonstrates that hLIF-05 prevents activation of a major signal transduction pathway for LIF-R ligands and is consistent with a block in receptor hetero-oligomerization.The broad specificity of hLIF-05 and its lack of intrinsic signaling make hLIF-05 a powerful reagent. As for other soluble antagonists, tailoring the dosage of hLIF-05 for a particular cell type allows flexibility in setting the degree of inhibition. hLIF-05 has been used successfully to demonstrate that LIF-R activation is required for the arrest of rod differentiation in cultures of mouse retinal cells (74Neophytou C. Vernallis A.B. Smith A. Raff M.C. Development. 1997; 124: 2345-2354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the future, hLIF-05 may prove useful in defining a role for LIF-R in receptor complexes for newly identified ligands. Antagonists specific to IL-4 receptor α also antagonized IL-13 responses, revealing receptor subunits shared between IL-4 and IL-13 (63Tony H.P. Shen B.J. Reusch P. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 75Aversa G. Punnonen J. Cocks B.G. de Waal Malefyt R. Vega Jr., F. Zurawski S.M. Zurawski G. de Vries J.E. J. Exp.

Application of hLIF-05 should lead to a better understanding of the role of LIF-R in a variety of homeostatic and disease processes.

Here we have examined systematically the interaction between Arg-43 (primate receptor) or Leu-43 (non-primate receptors) and their complementary hormone residues Asp-171 (primate GH) and His-170 (non-primate hormones) in a four-way comparison involving exchanges of histidine and aspartate and exchanges of arginine and leucine. BAF/B03 lines were created and characterized which stably expressed hGH receptor, R43L hGH receptor, rabbit GH receptor, and L43R rabbit GH receptor. These were examined for site 1 affinity, for the ability to bind intact cells, and for proliferative biopotency using hGH, D171H hGH, porcine GH, or H170D porcine GH. We find that the single interaction between Arg-43 and His-170/171 is sufficient to explain virtually all of the primate species specificity, and this is congruent with the crystal structure. Accordingly, for the first time we have been able to engineer a non-primate hormone to bind to and activate the human GH receptor. It has been known for more than 4 decades that only primate growth hormones are effective in primate species, but it is only with the availability of the 2.8 Å structure of the human growth hormone (hGH)·hGH-binding protein (hGHBP)2complex that Souza and co-workers (Souza, S. C., Frick, G. P., Wang, X., Kopchick, J. J., Lobo, R. B., and Goodman, H. M. (1995)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 959–963) were able to provide evidence that Arg-43 on the primate receptor is responsible. Here we have examined systematically the interaction between Arg-43 (primate receptor) or Leu-43 (non-primate receptors) and their complementary hormone residues Asp-171 (primate GH) and His-170 (non-primate hormones) in a four-way comparison involving exchanges of histidine and aspartate and exchanges of arginine and leucine. BAF/B03 lines were created and characterized which stably expressed hGH receptor, R43L hGH receptor, rabbit GH receptor, and L43R rabbit GH receptor.

We find that the single interaction between Arg-43 and His-170/171 is sufficient to explain virtually all of the primate species specificity, and this is congruent with the crystal structure. Accordingly, for the first time we have been able to engineer a non-primate hormone to bind to and activate the human GH receptor. The growth hormone receptor (GHR) 1The abbreviations used are: GHR, growth hormone receptor; GH, growth hormone; (GHBP)2, GH-binding protein; h, rb, b, and p prefixes indicate human, rabbit, bovine, and porcine, respectively; MAb, monoclonal antibody; MTT, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. is a member of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family, sharing common structural and functional features with receptors for prolactin, erythropoietin, granulocyte and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors, several interleukins, thrombopoietin, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M, and leptin (for review, see Refs. 1Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar and 2Takahashi Y. Kaji H. Okimura Y. Goji K. Abe H. Chihara K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Of this family, the interaction of GH with its receptor is the best characterized, primarily because of the extensive structure/function studies that have been carried out on both GH and the GHR (for review, see Ref. 1Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and because it is the only member for which the crystal structure of the hormone-receptor complex is known (3De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Both crystal structure and solution studies support the concept that two identical receptor subunits bind the helix bundle hormone through similar loop determinants on the receptor ॆ-sandwich structures. The hormone is captured by receptor 1 through binding to determinants located in a 900-Å2 patch encompassing helices 1 and 4 and the unstructured loop between helices 1 and 2. Eight key residues account for 857 of the binding energy, with electrostatic interactions governing the approach of hormone to the receptor binding site (4Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 5Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). Electrostatic interactions are also important specificity determinants because 5 of the 7 residues that were modified to enable prolactin to bind to the GH receptor with high affinity involved charged residues (6Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3407-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). GHs from humans and monkeys (primate GHs) are unique in that they are able to bind with and activate non-primate GHRs as well as primate GHRs, whereas the GHs from non-primates are ineffective in primates (for review, see Ref. 7Lauterio T.J. Trivedi B. Kapadia M. Daughaday W.H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 91: 15-19Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To elucidate which residues on the receptor are responsible for this species specificity of binding, sequence alignment analysis was performed on human GHR (hGHR) and a number of non-primate GHRs in conjunction with an examination of the crystal structure of the GH⋅(GHBP)2 complex. Of residues within the five major loops involved in hormone binding (2Takahashi Y. Kaji H. Okimura Y. Goji K. Abe H. Chihara K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the interaction between Arg-43 of the human receptor and Asp-171 of the human hormone is striking because in non-primate receptors this position is replaced by leucine, and histidine occupies the place of aspartate in non-primate hormones (the equivalent position in porcine and bovine GH is 170). An unfavorable charge repulsion/steric hindrance between hormone His-170 and receptor Arg-43, rather than a favorable salt bridge between this arginine and primate hormone Asp-171, could be an important element in the inability of non-primate hormones to bind to the human receptor. Accordingly, we previously undertook site-directed mutagenesis at position 43, converting Leu-43 of the rabbit receptor to arginine (L43R rbGHR), and compared the ability of wild type and mutant receptors to discriminate between binding of hGH and bovine GH (8Gobius K.S. Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Mattick J.S. Waters M.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We were disappointed to find that the L43R rbGHR mutant was able to bind human GH (hGH) and bovine GH (bGH) with almost identical affinity, indicating that it was not the species specificity determinant (8Gobius K.S. Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Mattick J.S. Waters M.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, a more recent study on bovine and rat GHRs by Souza et al. (9Souza S.C. Frick G.P. Wang X. Kopchick J.J. Lobo R.B. Goodman H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) has revealed that conversion of leucine to arginine at position 43 of these receptors severely abrogated the binding ability of bGH and also reduced its signaling ability. Based on the crystal structure of the GH·(GHBP)2 complex, Souzaet al. (9Souza S.C. Frick G.P. Wang X. Kopchick J.J. Lobo R.B. Goodman H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) again proposed that an unfavorable interaction between His-170 on non-primate GH and Arg-43 on the human receptor accounts for primate specificity of binding. In this study, we have sought to resolve this conflict. We have examined the binding and signaling characteristics of rabbit and human GHRs with human, porcine, and bovine GHs as well as the effect of exchanging both the receptor leucine for arginine and the hormone histidine for aspartate. This has allowed us to bind a non-primate GH to the human receptor for the first time and to resolve the conflict between our previous study and that of Souza et al. (9Souza S.C. Frick G.P. Wang X. Kopchick J.J. Lobo R.B. Goodman H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Preparation of recombinant pGH and H170D pGH has been described previously (10Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Bastiras S. Robins A.J. Senn C. Wells J.R.E. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J.

Human GH and the D171H hGH analog were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to greater than 987 homogeneity (by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the manner described previously (10Rowlinson S.W.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11724-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), except that the pH of the refolding buffer and Q-Sepharose loading buffer was 8.2. The D171H mutation was introduced into the coding sequence of the hGH cDNA using the Altered Sites mutagenesis procedure (Promega). In this procedure, an oligonucleotide encoding the desired mutation is annealed to single strand hGH-pSelect, and the complex is incubated with T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase (Promega) to produce double stranded circular plasmid according to instructions from Promega. This was then subcloned into the pC611 vector (kindly provided by BresaGen, Adelaide, Australia) for expression, as described before (10Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Bastiras S. Robins A.J. Senn C. Wells J.R.E. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11724-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The mutation was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Sequenase kit) of the complete D171H coding region. Hormone concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of ε280 = 18,200 m−1cm−1. Site-directed mutagenesis was undertaken on the rabbit GHR (rbGHR) and hGHR cDNA using the Altered Sites mutagenesis procedure as described previously (8Gobius K.S. Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Mattick J.S. Waters M.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutant sequences were then subcloned into the pECE expression vector. Creation of rabbit L43R and human R43L GHR mutants and the absence of other coding sequence changes were verified by dideoxy sequencing. The interleukin-3-dependent cell line BAF/B03 was a gift from Dr. Tom Gonda (Institute for Medical and Veterinary Sciences, Adelaide). Cells were routinely passaged in 57 CO2, at 37 °C, in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5 ॖg/ml gentamicin, 107 serum supreme (a fetal bovine serum alternative supplied by Biowhittaker through Edward Keller Australia Ltd., Underwood Queensland) and 50 units/ml interleukin-3 (generous gift from Dr A. Hapel, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian Capital Territory, Australia). Mid confluent BAF/B03 cells (200 ॖl of 2.5 × 107/ml growth medium) were transfected by electroporation with GHR cDNA and pNeo plasmid at a ratio of 20:1 in a manner identical to that described in Ref. 11Rowlinson S.W.

After electroporation, transfectants were selected by treatment with G418 at 1.2 mg/ml followed by selection of single cells and clonal expansion. Equilibrium binding constants for all GHs were determined with the appropriate cell line in physiological binding buffer (8Gobius K.S. Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Mattick J.S. Waters M.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using 125I-hGH as described in Ref. 10Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Bastiras S. Robins A.J. Senn C. Wells J.R.E. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11724-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar. Assays were done at 4 °C to block receptor internalization, with equilibrium being reached by 18 h. The number of surface-expressed receptors and the hormone binding affinity for each cell line were determined using cells grown in GH-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 ॖg/ml gentamicin, 57 serum supreme, and 50 units/ml of interleukin-3. Binding assays were also performed on solubilized cell extracts as follows. Cells were lysed with 0.37 (v/v) Triton X-100 in physiological binding buffer in the presence of 5 ॖg/ml MAb 5 and microcentrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min to recover the solubilized receptors. Equilibrium binding assays (in the presence of MAb 5 (AGEN Ltd., Acacia Ridge, Queensland) at 5 ॖg/ml) were then undertaken on solubilized cell extracts for 18 h at 4 °C, with bound/free separation by polyethylene glycol precipitation, as in Ref. 12Waters M.J.

MAb 5 has been shown to block receptor dimer formation through binding to the dimerization domain residues (13Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A.

Binding data were processed by Scatchard analysis with the LIGAND program (Elsevier Biosoft). MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) cell viability assays were performed in the manner described in Ref. 11Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Bastiras S. Robins A.J.

Because the magnitude of GH responsiveness of these GHR-expressing cell lines is related to the level of receptor expression, 2S. W. Rowlinson, S. N. Behncken, and M. J. Waters, unpublished observations. it was necessary to plate clonal cell lines at different concentrations to obtain comparable response. BAF/B03-rbGHR cells (expressing wild type rabbit GHR), BAF/B03-hGHR cells (expressing wild type human GHR), and BAF/B03-L43R rbGHR cells (expressing L43R rbGHR) were plated out at 2.5 × 104 cells/well, whereas BAF/B03-R43L hGHR cells (expressing R43L hGHR) were plated at 6 × 104cells/well. The complete coordinates of the hGH·(hGHBP)2 complex were obtained from the PDB data base (accession number 3hhr). The homology-modeled pGH·(rbGHBP)2 complex was obtained with the Homology program (Biosym Technologies, San Diego) with the assistance of Ross Brinkworth, Drug Design Center, University of Queensland (10Rowlinson S.W.

Crystal structure measurements were made with the Insight II program (Biosym Technologies), and molecular dynamics and energy minimizations were done using the Discover module. BAF/B03 cells were preferred over FDC-P1 cells in this study as we have found that they express GHRs at a higher level than FDC-P1 cells. Whole cell Scatchard analysis (at least three independent assays where125I-hGH was displaced by unlabeled hGH for each cell line) revealed an affinity for hGH of of 2.9 ± 0.2 × 109m−1 with 7,419 ± 777 receptors/cell for BAF/B03-hGHR cells, an affinity of 3.3 ± 0.2 × 109m−1 with 3,164 ± 528 receptors/cell for BAF/B03-R43L hGHR cells, an affinity of 6.0 ± 0.6 × 109m−1 with 7,285 ± 618 receptors/cell for BAF/B03-rGHR cells, and an affinity of 5.0 ± 0.4 × 109m−1 with 2,852 ± 455 receptors/cell for BAF/B03-L43R rGHR cells. No specific125I-hGH binding was seen in nontransfected BAF/B03 cells. The fact that ED50 values for proliferative biopotency are around 0.05 × 10−9m (Tables I, II, III, IV, see below) suggests that there is a substantial number of spare receptors in these lines.Table IFold changes of various hormones with wild type hGHR (relative to wild type hGH)HormoneAffinityProliferative abilitySolubilized receptorWhole cellhGH1 (K a = 1.18 ± 0.13 × 109 m−1)1 (K a = 2.50 ± 0.15 × 109 m−1)1 (ED50 = 2.09 ± 0.36 × 10−11 m)D171H hGH36.7 ± 1.1↓2.1 ± 0.3↓1.9 ± 0.3↓pGH>10,000↓3,904.5 ± 828.7↓2,342.2 ± 390.3↓H170D pGH32.3 ± 1.9↓24.5 ± 3.9↓14.0 ± 2.2↓bGHND1-aND, not determined.314.1 ± 46.8↓235.8 ± 64.2↓Fold change values were derived from experiments on all five hormones performed simultaneously with the same cell/receptor preparation (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡).

The affinity of bGH for the solubilized receptors was not determined. For experimental details, see legend of Table III. TableI presents the combined data for wild type human GH receptor-expressing cells, and Fig.1, A–C, presents representative data in graphic form. First, it can be seen that substitution of histidine for aspartate at position 171 of hGH has only a small effect (about a 2-fold reduction) on binding in the whole cell assay and on biopotency. However, in the solubilized assay where dimerization cannot occur, this substitution is seen to have a considerable impact on site 1 affinity (about a 40-fold decrease). Porcine GH is seen to bind very poorly in the whole cell assay (about 4,000-fold less than hGH) and to be very poorly effective in the bioassay (about 2,300-fold less). In the solubilized receptor assay, pGH effectively does not bind to the hGHR. However, substitution of aspartate for histidine at position 170 of pGH results in a hormone that is only 24-fold less than hGH in whole cell binding affinity and 14-fold less in biopotency. This is essentially a result of increased site 1 interaction because in the solubilized receptor assay the affinity of H170D pGH for the hGHR is only about 30-fold lower than hGH. The converse study, where Arg-43 in the hGHR is replaced by a leucine, shows that D171H hGH now binds and signals as effectively as wild type hGH (Table II). Against the R43L hGHR, pGH now behaves similarly to the way H170D pGH does against the wild type human receptor, i.e. its whole cell affinity is about 15-fold less than hGH, its biopotency is about 14-fold less than hGH, and in the solubilized receptor assay its affinity is only 30-fold less than hGH. Thus, mutation of either receptor Arg-43 to non-primate leucine or mutation of hormone Asp-171 to non-primate histidine has a very similar effect on magnitude of binding affinity and biopotency. This effect is also seen with another non-primate GH, bGH, which binds and acts poorly against the wild type human receptor but is quite effective (3–4-fold less than hGH) against human receptor with leucine in position 43. TableIII presents the combined affinity and biopotency data for the same GH analogs, but in this case against the rbGHR. It can be seen that replacement of Asp-171 of hGH with histidine has little effect on binding or bioactivity. Again there is a small loss in solubilized receptor affinity, suggesting that aspartate is slightly more effective in this position against receptor Leu-43, but clearly either histidine or aspartate sits well against a leucine at receptor residue 43. Porcine GH is considerably less effective than hGH against the rabbit receptor in accord with our previous data (11Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Bastiras S. Robins A.J. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16833-16839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This would appear to be primarily a result of poor site 1 interactions because the affinity of pGH in the solubilized receptor assay is markedly less than hGH. This poor interaction is evidently not a result of hormone residue 170 interactions because substituting aspartate for histidine at this position again improves solubilized receptor affinity by only 2–3-fold, against leucine at position 43. Bovine GH is seen to bind and act considerably more effectively than pGH against the rabbit receptor (Table III). Creation of a 舠humanized舡 rabbit receptor by replacing Arg-43 with leucine provides the final argument for the importance of this interaction in determining primate specificity (TableIV). As with the wild type rabbit receptor, hGH binds more strongly than it does against its own receptor. However, replacing Asp-171 with histidine markedly decreases (about 50-fold) site 1 affinity. Evidently strong site 2 interactions are able to compensate in that the whole cell affinity and biopotency are not markedly (about 2-fold) different from wild type hGH. Porcine GH now binds very poorly in the whole cell assay and effectively does not bind in the solubilized receptor assay. Biopotency is also very markedly reduced. This situation is effectively reversed by substitution of His-170 with aspartate, so that this analog now behaves similarly to pGH binding in its binding to the wild type rabbit receptor. In support of both our previous study (8Gobius K.S. Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Mattick J.S. Waters M.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the study of (9Souza S.C. Frick G.P. Wang X. Kopchick J.J. Lobo R.B. Goodman H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), bovine GH binding to the L43R rabbit receptor is only about 2.5-fold less than binding to wild type rabbit receptor, yet in the solubilized receptor assay its site 1 binding is very poor (700-fold less), and its biopotency is reduced quite strongly (about 35-fold). MTT assays were used as described previously (11Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Bastiras S. Robins A.J. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16833-16839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to compare the biopotencies of the various hormone preparations against wild type or mutant GHR-expressing cells. Because two GHRs interact with one GH molecule and because they use virtually the same residues to interact with the hormone at either site 1 or site 2 (3De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar, 14Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. Abraham M. DeVos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), it is not possible to compare the relative biopotencies between wild type and mutant cell lines because of the uncertainty that the mutation could be affecting the bioactivity through site 2 interactions and not site 1 interactions. For this reason the biopotencies of the GHs with different cell lines are compared relative to wild type hGH. With the hGHR-expressing cell line, the D171H hGH mutant was similar to wild type in its biopotency (see 舠Discussion舡). The non-primate GHs, bGH and pGH, were very poor agonists for this cell line, showing 235- and 2,342-fold lower biopotency relative to hGH. For pGH, the introduction of the H170D mutation improved the biopotency such that it is only 14-fold lower than that of hGH, an improvement of greater than 150-fold. Similar improvements in biopotency were observed with bGH and pGH upon the introduction of the R43L mutation in the hGHR. In this case, the biopotency of these hormones relative to hGH became only 3.6- and 13.5-fold lower than hGH, an improvement of more than 80- and 150-fold, respectively, when compared with the wild type hGHR-expressing cell line. In contrast, the H170D pGH analog exhibited similar biopotencies against the wild type hGHR- and R43L hGHR-expressing cell lines, indicating that aspartate at this location is equally well tolerated against either"

Treatment with cAMP-elevating agents potently inhibited Ang II-induced protein synthesis in rat aortic smooth muscle cells and in rat fibroblasts expressing the human AT1 receptor. The inhibition was dose-dependent and was observed at all concentrations of the peptide. To explore the mechanism of cAMP action, we have analyzed the effects of forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine on various receptor-mediated responses. Elevation of cAMP did not alter the binding properties of the AT1 receptor and did not interfere with the activation of phospholipase C or the induction of early growth response genes by Ang II. Likewise, Ang II-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/ERK2 and p70 S6 kinase was unaffected by cAMP. In contrast, we found that increased concentration of cAMP strongly inhibited the stimulatory effect of Ang II on protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Specifically, cAMP abolished Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion-associated protein paxillin and of the tyrosine kinase Tyk2. These results identify a novel mechanism by which the cAMP signaling system may exert growth-inhibitory effects in specific cell types.

Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a pleiotropic second messenger that has been implicated as a modulator of cell proliferation in several cell types. Intriguingly, depending on the cellular origin and the differentiation state of the cell, cAMP is found to cause either growth inhibition or growth stimulation. For example, elevation of intracellular cAMP stimulates the proliferation of thyrocytes, keratinocytes, epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and Swiss 3T3 cells. On the contrary, elevated cAMP inhibits cell proliferation in fibroblasts, SMC, 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cell(s); PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; Ang II, angiotensin II; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MEK, MAP kinase/ERK kinase; kb, kilobase. lymphoid cells, and many tumor cells (for review, see Refs. 1Pastan I.H.

In these cells, cAMP interferes with the mitogenic response to growth factors acting on both receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors (6Magnaldo I. Pouysségur J. Paris S. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to their effect on cell proliferation, cAMP analogs can also partially reverse the phenotype of transformed fibroblasts as well as other cancer cells (5Cho-Chung Y.S. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7093-7100PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pastan I. Willingham M. Nature. 1978; 274: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The regulatory effects of cAMP are mediated through activation of the multifunctional cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A or PKA) (8Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). These effects are exerted both at the post-translational level and at the transcriptional level through phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element-binding proteins (CREB/ATF family) (9Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of gene regulation by cAMP, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which the nucleotide modulates cell growth. A number of studies have proposed that cAMP might inhibit cell proliferation by interfering with Ras-dependent activation of MAP kinases (11Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of the various intermediates in the signaling cascade indicated that cAMP inhibits signal transmission by preventing Ras-dependent activation of the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 (11Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 12Cook S.J. McCormick F.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect of cAMP was mediated by PKA because it was not observed in mutant cells that express a PKA resistant to activation by cAMP (14Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10305-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, treatment of CCL39 fibroblasts (16Kahan C. Seuwen K. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13369-13375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or interleukin-2-dependent T lymphocytes (17Monfar M. Lemon K.P. Grammer T.C. Cheatham L. Chung J. Vlahos C.J. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) with cAMP-raising agents was found to block cell proliferation completely without affecting growth factor-induced MAP kinase activation. Another study reported that treatment of murine macrophages with analogs of cAMP raises the overall amount of the inhibitor p27 kip1, thereby increasing its association with cyclin D-Cdk4 and preventing the activation of Cdk4 (18Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massagné J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). cAMP was also shown to reduce the accumulation of c-myc mRNA in various cell lines (19Blomhoff H.K. Smeland E.B. Beiske K. Blomhoff R. Ruud E. Bjoro T. Pfeifer-Ohlsson S. Watt R. Funderud S. Godal T. Ohlsson R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Trepel J.B.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2351-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PKA exercises regulatory control on both growth and division, suggesting a role for cAMP in the homeostatic integration of these two processes (23Baroni M.D. Monti P. Alberghina L. Nature. 1994; 371: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Tokiwa G. Tyers M. Volpe T. Futcher B. Nature. 1994; 371: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It is not known whether cAMP exerts similar control on the overall rate of protein synthesis in mammalian cells under conditions of growth factor stimulation or cellular stress. Ang II is a growth factor for a number of cell types, including adrenocortical cells, proximal tubular cells, vascular SMC, cardiac myocytes, and cardiac fibroblasts (for review, see Refs. 25Schelling P. Fischer H. Ganten D. J. Hypertens. 1991; 9: 3-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 26Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Raizada M.K. Phillips M.I. Sumners C. Cellular and Molecular Biology of the Renin-Angiotensin System. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 471-483Google Scholar). In cultured aortic SMC, Ang II induces cellular hypertrophy as a result of increased protein synthesis but not cell proliferation (27Geisterfer A.A.T. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 28Berk B.C. Vekshtein V. Gordon H.M. Tsuda T.

The growth-promoting effects of the peptide are mediated by the AT1 receptor subtype, a member of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. Agonist binding to the AT1receptor stimulates the activity of phospholipase C, to generate the second messengers InsP3 and diacylglycerol, and inhibits the activity of adenylyl cyclase (for review, see Refs. 31Timmermans P.B.M.W.M.

One of the immediate consequences of these early signals is activation of the MAP kinases ERK1/ERK2 (33Servant M.J. Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activation of the AT1 receptor also leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins in target cells (36Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bonventre V. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 582-592PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these observations, the nature of the signaling mechanisms coupling the AT1 receptor to the hypertrophic response remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of increased intracellular levels of cAMP on Ang II-stimulated protein synthesis in vascular SMC. We show that cAMP-raising agents potently inhibit the hypertrophic effect of Ang II. In addition, we demonstrate that increased cAMP selectively antagonizes the stimulatory effect of Ang II on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells. 125I-Labeled [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (sarile) was prepared by radioiodination of sarile using a solid phase method as described (41Lambert C. Massillon Y. Meloche S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Forskolin, IBMX, Vibrio cholerae toxin and 8-bromo-cAMP were obtained from Calbiochem. Forskolin and IBMX were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to give stock solutions of 100 mm and 500 mm, respectively. Cholera toxin was dissolved in water at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, and 8-bromo-cAMP was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) at a concentration of 100 mm. Isoproterenol was a gift of Dr. Michel Bouvier (University of Montreal) and was prepared as a 0.5 msolution in 107 ascorbic acid. The source of other materials has been described (30Giasson E.

Antiserum S6-24 was produced in rabbits against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 2–30 of rat p70S6K (Quality Controlled Biochemicals). The anti-p125FAK mAb 2A7 was generously provided by Dr. Thomas Parsons (University of Virginia). The anti-Shc serum was provided by Dr. Louise Larose (McGill University). The anti-paxillin and anti-Pyk2 mAbs were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 and anti-Tyk2 polyclonal antibody were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology and Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Rat aortic SMC were cultured and synchronized as described previously (30Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Rat1-AT1 cells are Rat1 fibroblasts stably expressing the human Ang II AT1receptor. 2S. Meloche, M. J. Servant, I. Leduc, and J. Pellerin, submitted for publication. Rat1-AT1 cells were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 107 calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, antibiotics, and 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin. They were made quiescent by incubating confluent cell cultures in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium containing 15 mmHepes (pH 7.4) and 0.17 bovine serum albumin for 24 h. For experiments with cAMP-raising agents, the cells were treated with vehicle alone or with the indicated concentrations of agents for 30 min before the addition of Ang II. The intracellular mass of cAMP was determined by a specific protein binding assay (44Tovey K.C. Oldham K.G. Whelan J.A.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1974; 56: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Quiescent cells in 35-mm Petri dishes were incubated with the indicated agents for 20 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the medium was removed and the cells washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then scraped into 500–1,000 ॖl of cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mm EDTA, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of 50–100 ॖl of cell extract was analyzed for cAMP content using a competitive protein binding assay kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Diagnostic Products Corporation). Membranes from rat aortic SMC were prepared as described (45Meloche S. Ong H. Cantin M. De Léan A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 30: 537-543PubMed Google Scholar). Competition binding studies were carried out by incubating aortic SMC membranes (50 ॖg) for 1 h at 25 °C with 0.2 nm125I-sarile and varying concentrations of Ang II in a total volume of 250 ॖl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.17 heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin). Bound 125I-sarile was separated from free ligand by rapid filtration through GF/B filters presoaked with 0.27 bovine serum albumin, followed by washing with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl. The filters were counted for radioactivity. Averages of duplicate determinations of bound 125I-sarile were used for data analysis. Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting using the SCAFIT computer program (46De Léan A. Hancock A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 5-16PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular mass of InsP3 was measured by a specific radioreceptor assay as described previously (40Leduc I. Haddad P. Giasson E. Meloche S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 582-592PubMed Google Scholar). Averages of duplicate determinations of bound [3H]InsP3 were used for data analysis. The mass of InsP3 is expressed as pmol of InsP3produced/mg of protein. Quiescent aortic SMC in 60-mm Petri dishes were stimulated with 10 nm Ang II for either 5 min (ERK assays), 3 min (MEK assays), or 15 min (p70S6Kassays). The enzymatic activity of ERK isoforms was measured by specific immune complex kinase assays using myelin basic protein as substrate as described (30Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 42Meloche S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The phosphotransferase activity of p70S6K was measured by an immune complex kinase assay using the S6 peptide RRRLSSLRA (Upstate Biotechnology) as substrate (30Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of MEK1 and MEK2 was assayed by measuring their ability to increase the myelin basic protein kinase activity of recombinant ERK1 in vitro (33Servant M.J. Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16047-16052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Quiescent aortic SMC in 100-mm Petri dishes were stimulated with 10 nm Ang II for the indicated times at 37 °C. Total RNA was extracted with guanidinium thiocyanate as described (47Chomczinski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total RNA (10–20 ॖg) were denatured by heating for 15 min at 65 °C in 2.2 mformaldehyde and 507 formamide and resolved by electrophoresis in a 17 agarose gel containing 1.87 formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to Hybond-N (Amersham) nylon membranes by vacuum blotting, fixed, and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes. Hybridization was carried out in hybridization medium (5 × SSC (1 × SSC = 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate), 0.17 SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution (1 × Denhardt's = 0.027 Ficoll 400, 0.027 polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.027 bovine serum albumin), 507 formamide, and 100 ॖg/ml herring sperm DNA) containing the labeled probe (1–2 × 106 cpm/ml) for 16 h at 42 °C. The membranes were washed twice at 25 °C for 15 min in 2 × SSC, 0.17 SDS, and twice at 60 °C for 30 min in 0.5 × SSC, 0.17 SDS. The extent of hybridization was analyzed with a PhosphorImager apparatus (Molecular Dynamics). The results were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. The probes used were a 0.9-kb PstI fragment of mouse c-fos cDNA (provided by Dr. Mona Nemer, University of Montreal), a 1.1-kb PstI-EcoRI fragment of mousefosB cDNA (provided by Dr. Rodrigo Bravo, Bristol-Myers Squibb), a 0.7-kb HindIII fragment of mouse egr-1cDNA (provided by Dr. Trang Hoang, University of Montreal), a 1.8-kb HindIII fragment of mouse c-myc cDNA (provided by Dr. Alain Nepveu, McGill University), and a 1.2-kbXbaI-PstI fragment of rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. All of the probes were labeled by random priming. Quiescent aortic SMC were stimulated with 10 nm Ang II for the indicated times at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 40 mmॆ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10−4m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10−6m leupeptin, 10−6m pepstatin A, 17 Triton X-100) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 10 min, and normalized amounts of lysate proteins (500–600 ॖg) were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with the following antibodies preadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads: 10 ॖl of anti-paxillin, 2.5 ॖl of anti-Shc, 5 ॖl of anti-p125FAK, 4 ॖl of anti-Pyk2, or 10 ॖl of anti-Tyk2. Immune complexes were washed three times with Triton X-100 lysis buffer, and the eluted proteins were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 7.57 acrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine. After fixation for 15 min in 407 methanol, 77 acetic acid, 37 glycerol, the membrane was blocked for 1 h at 37 °C in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.17 Tween 20 and 17 bovine serum albumin and then incubated for 2 h at 25 °C with mAb 4G10 (1:3,000) in blocking solution. The membrane was washed five times in Tris-buffered saline, 0.17 Tween 20 prior to incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG diluted 1:10,000 in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.17 Tween 20 and 37 non-fat dry milk. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). For immunoblotting of total phosphotyrosyl proteins, equal amounts of lysate proteins (100 ॖg) were resolved on 7.57 acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described above. The membrane was incubated for 2 h at 25 °C with mAb 4G10 (1:3,000) in blocking solution. After washing, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (1:3,000) in Tris-buffered saline, 0.17 Tween 20 for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. Quiescent aortic SMC or Rat1-AT1 cells in triplicate wells of 24-well plates were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of Ang II in serum-free medium containing 0.5 ॖCi/ml [3H]leucine. After 24 h of stimulation, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were incubated for a minimum of 30 min in cold 57 trichloroacetic acid. The wells were then washed once with trichloroacetic acid and three times with tap water. The radioactivity incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was measured by liquid scintillation counting after solubilization in 0.1 m NaOH. Where indicated, the cells were stimulated for 24 h with Ang II in the continuous presence of cAMP-elevating agents. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Dose-response curves were analyzed according to a four-parameter logistic equation using the ALLFIT computer program (48De Léan A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ang II is a hypertrophic factor that potently stimulates protein synthesis in rat aortic SMC but has no effect on DNA synthesis or cell proliferation (27Geisterfer A.A.T. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 28Berk B.C. Vekshtein V. Gordon H.M. Tsuda T.

To examine the effect of cAMP on the growth response to Ang II, aortic SMC were treated with a variety of agents known to increase intracellular cAMP, and the rate of protein synthesis was determined by [3H]leucine incorporation. As shown in Fig. 1, the addition of cAMP-raising agents strongly inhibited the stimulatory effect of Ang II on protein synthesis, without affecting the basal rate of protein synthesis. All of these agents were found to raise the intracellular concentration of cAMP significantly (data not shown). The growth-inhibitory effect of cAMP was reversible, and no sign of long term cytotoxicity was observed at the concentrations of agents used. The cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX and the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin were the most effective inhibitors, reducing the trophic effect of Ang II by 100 and 707, respectively. These two compounds were therefore used in all subsequent experiments. Pharmacological studies revealed that forskolin and IBMX block Ang II-induced leucine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner. Half-maximal inhibition was observed at a concentration of 0.5 ± 0.2 ॖm forskolin and 79 ± 18 ॖm IBMX (Fig. 2). We also analyzed the effect of the two inhibitors on the rate of protein synthesis at different concentrations of Ang II. Fig.3 shows that treatment with forskolin or IBMX inhibited the induction of protein synthesis by every concentration of the peptide. The half-maximal effect of Ang II on protein synthesis was found to be similar in the absence or in the presence of either forskolin or IBMX. Taken together, these results demonstrate that elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP, through different cellular mechanisms, antagonizes the stimulatory effect of Ang II on protein synthesis. This inhibitory effect of cAMP is presumably mediated by activation of PKA.Figure 3Effect of forskolin and IBMX on the dose dependence of Ang II for the stimulation of protein synthesis.Quiescent rat aortic SMC were stimulated for 24 h with the indicated concentrations of Ang II in the absence (○) or presence of 10 ॖm forskolin (•) or 0.1 mm IBMX (▿). Protein synthesis was measured by [3H]leucine incorporation. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of triplicate determinations. Similar results were obtained in three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore the mechanism by which cAMP interferes with the activation of protein synthesis by Ang II, we examined the effects of forskolin and IBMX on various receptor-mediated responses. Ang II has been shown to exert its hypertrophic effect through activation of the AT1 receptor subtype, a member of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (29Chiu A.T. Roscoe W.A. McCall D.E. Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Receptor. 1991; 1: 133-140PubMed Google Scholar, 30Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We first tested the effect of increased cAMP levels on the agonist binding properties of the AT1 receptor by performing competition binding studies in membranes derived from either control cells or cells treated with forskolin or IBMX. As shown in Fig. 4, treatment with cAMP-raising agents did not change the total number of membrane AT1 receptor sites. Computer analysis by nonlinear regression revealed that Ang II competition binding data are best explained by a model with two different affinity states of the receptor. The proportion of high affinity sites and the affinity for Ang II (control, K d = 2.1 nm; forskolin,K d = 1.1 nm; IBMX, K d = 1.6 nm) was similar in control cells and cAMP-treated cells, indicating that elevation of cAMP does not interfere with the initial coupling of the AT1 receptor with G proteins. We next analyzed the effect of cAMP on phospholipase C activation by measuring the intracellular mass of InsP3. Ang II binding to the AT1 receptor has been shown to stimulate the activity of phospholipase C in aortic SMC and in many other target cells rapidly (31Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Benfield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J. Wexler R.R. Saye J.A.M. Smith R.D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 205-251PubMed Google Scholar, 32Catt K.J. Sandberg K. Balla T. Raizada M.K. Phillips M.I. Sumners C. Cellular and Molecular Biology of the Renin-Angiotensin System. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 307-356Google Scholar). Pretreatment of the cells with either forskolin or IBMX did not prevent the rapid increase in the production of InsP3 induced by Ang II (Fig.5). These results indicate that cAMP does not inhibit the growth effect of Ang II by interfering with early receptor-mediated signaling events. In common with growth factors, Ang II potently stimulates the enzymatic activity of the MAP kinase isoforms ERK1/ERK2 in vascular SMC (30Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol.

DT does not bind to mouse proHB-EGF because of amino acid substitutions within the EGF-like domain. We made 10 independent mutants, replacing a single amino acid within the EGF-like domain of human DTR/proHB-EGF with the corresponding amino acid residue in mouse proHB-EGF. The mutant proteins were transiently expressed in mouse L cells either expressing or not expressing DRAP27/CD9, and DT binding was measured. DT binding activity of GST fusion proteins containing the mutated EGF-like domain was also determined by a cell-free binding assay. The largest effect was seen with E141H, and second largest effects were seen with F115Y and L127F in all of the assay systems. We conclude that Phe115, Leu127, and Glu141 are critical amino acid residues for DT binding. A computer model of the tertiary structure of the EGF-like domain of human DTR/proHB-EGF was made. The model predicts that three amino acid residues critical for DT binding activity, Phe115, Leu127, and Glu141, are all located on the same face of the EGF-like domain, suggesting that this face of DTR/proHB-EGF interacts with the receptor-binding domain of DT.

DT inhibits cellular protein synthesis in eukaryotes by inactivating elongation factor 2 through ADP-ribosylation. DT is composed of two fragments, A and B, which are covalently linked by a disulfide bond. The crystal structure of DT reveals that DT is actually composed of three distinct domains, the catalytic domain (C-domain), which is A-fragment itself, the transmembrane domain (T-domain), which is essential for the translocation of the C-domain to the cytoplasm, and the receptor-binding domain (R-domain), which binds to DT receptor (DTR) (3Choe S.

The DTR is the principal protein involved in binding DT to cells, and the DT sensitivity of cells is determined primarily by the presence or absence of DTR (16Middlebrook J.L. Dorland R.B.

DTR/proHB-EGF exists on the cell surface as a complex with a tetramembrane-spanning protein DRAP27/CD9 (21Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E.

Although proHB-EGF is ubiquitously expressed in species including human, monkey, rat, and mouse (30Abraham J.A. Damm D. Bajardi A. Miller J. Klagsbrun M. Ezekowitz R.E.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Transfection of human or mouse proHB-EGF cDNAs into mouse L cells revealed that mouse cells are insensitive to DT because mouse proHB-EGF does not bind the toxin (33Mitamura T. Higashiyama S.

Use of human/mouse proHB-EGF chimeras demonstrated that DT binds to the EGF-like domain of human proHB-EGF but not to the EGF-like domain of mouse proHB-EGF (33Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). There are 10 amino acid differences between the EGF-like domain of human DTR/proHB-EGF and that of mouse proHB-EGF. Thus, mouse proHB-EGF is a natural mutant form of DTR. These nonconserved amino acid residues are good candidates for site-directed mutagenesis to study the relationship of proHB-EGF primary structure to its function as the DTR. We introduced several mutations within the coding region for the EGF-like domain of human DTR/proHB-EGF and identified amino acid residues required for DT binding activity. A computer model of the tertiary structure of the human EGF-like domain of HB-EGF, based on the NMR structure of TGF-α (34Harvey T.S. Wilkinson A.J. Tappin M.J. Cooke R.M. Campbell I.D. Eur. J.

Affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody was purchased from Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC. All point mutations to alter amino acid residues were introduced into pTHG-1, which contains the entire human DTR/proHB-EGF coding region (33Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M.

Four chimeric plasmids containing multiple substitutions were constructed as follows. Three plasmids, pTMHG-1, pTMHGDS-1, and pTMHGDK-1, which encode mouse proHB-EGF, human/mouse HB-EGF chimera H(106–136), and human/mouse HB-EGF chimera H(106–186), respectively (33Mitamura T.

This segment encodes the recognition site for anti-human proHB-EGF antibody (H-6) (21Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E.

The resulting plasmids were named pTMHG-1tag, pTMHGDS-1tag, and pTMHGDK-1tag, respectively. Two plasmids, pTMHGDS-1tag and pTMHGDK-1tag, were digested either with DraII andSacI or with SacI and SmaI then ligated with synthetic DNAs encoding the corresponding regions of mouse proHB-EGF, except for Phe127. Compared with human proHB-EGF, the resulting plasmids have four types of multiple mutations within the EGF-like domain (Fig. 1). TheBstXI-NotI fragment of each plasmid was introduced into the expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA), and construction of all mutant plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing as described previously (33Mitamura T.

Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the EGF-like domain of DTR/proHB-EGF were produced in Escherichia coli as follows. DNA fragments encoding the EGF-like domain, Asp106–Pro149, were amplified from plasmids for wild-type human DTR/proHB-EGF and single mutants using the polymerase chain reaction. The primers used were forward primer 5′-GTGGGATCCCCGGTGGATCAGACCCATGTCGGAAATAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATGAATTCTATGGGAGGCTCAGCCCATGACACC-3′, except in the case of the S147T mutant for which the reverse primer containing the appropriate mutated sequence was used. The amplified fragments were digested withBamHI and EcoRI, and the resulting fragments were ligated into the corresponding restriction enzyme sites in the expression vector, pGEX-3X (Pharmacia). Consequently, the new sequence Gly-Gly-Ser was created between the C terminus of GST and the N terminus of DTR. Construction of all recombinant plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mouse L cells and LC cells, stable transfectants of mouse L cells expressing DRAP27 (27Mitamura T. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Yomo T. Urabe I. Tsuneoka M. Mekada E. J.

GST fusion proteins containing the wild type and mutated forms of the EGF-like domain of human DTR/proHB-EGF were purified by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purities of all the fusion proteins were estimated to be about 907 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For binding assays, glutathione-Sepharose 4B gel (2.5-ॖl bed volume) was suspended in 480 ॖl of DT binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3 mm sodium azide) and incubated with 1.5 ॖg of purified recombinant GST or GST fusion proteins in a rotator. The gel was washed three times with DT binding buffer and then was incubated with 50 ng/ml 125I-DT in 1 ml of DT binding buffer in the presence or absence of unlabeled DT at 4 °C for 6 h with gentle rotation. The gel was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 3 mm sodium azide, and the radioactivity that remained bound to the gel was counted by a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding of 125I-DT was assessed in the presence of a 1,000-fold excess of unlabeled DT. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding obtained using 125I-DT alone. L cells or LC cells transiently transfected with various mutant plasmids were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 5 ॖg/ml H-6 antibody in binding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing nonessential amino acids, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2) supplemented with 107 calf serum).

Finally, cells were washed with washing buffer three times and the cell-associated radioactivity was counted. Computer modeling was interactively performed using the Homology program (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA). Side chains of the minimized average structure of TGF-α (34Harvey T.S. Wilkinson A.J.

Conformations of side chains were selected from a rotamer library (36Benedetti E. Morelli G. Nemethy G. Scheraga H.A. Int. J. Pept.

Amino acid residues that were identical in the two amino acid sequences were not changed. The model was bathed in 1723 TIP-3P water (38Jorgensen W.L. J. Am. Chem.

The 10 independent mutants of human DTR/proHB-EGF with substitutions of single amino acid residues from the sequence of mouse proHB-EGF and three chimeric proteins with multiple substitutions studied here are shown in Fig. 1. The mutant proteins, wild-type human DTR/proHB-EGF, and mouse proHB-EGF were transiently expressed in recipient cells, and the DT binding activity of the cells was measured. Both mouse L cells and LC cells were used as the recipient cells. L cells do not express DRAP27/CD9 (25Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar); thus effects of the amino acid alternations on DT binding could be observed independently of effects on the interaction of DTR/proHB-EGF with DRAP27/CD9. The LC cell line is a stable transfectant of mouse L cells that express DRAP27/CD9. Using this cell line allows the effects of the amino acid alternations to be observed under conditions in which DTR can interact with DRAP27/CD9. Although the transfection efficiency for the recipient cells used in this study was usually 30–507, the efficiency varied from experiment to experiment. Furthermore, the efficiency of DTR/proHB-EGF expression on the cell surface may differ among mutants. Therefore, to compare DT binding activities of the mutant proteins with that of wild type we normalized DT binding to the amount of proHB-EGF expressed on the cell surface. ProHB-EGF on the cell surface was measured for each set of transfected cells using an anti-human proHB-EGF antibody and125I-labeled secondary antibody as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 The anti-human proHB-EGF antibody used here was obtained by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 54–73 of human DTR/proHB-EGF. This antibody reacts with all of the mutant proteins used. Although it would be difficult to determine the absolute amounts of proHB-EGF by such an indirect method, for the present purpose only, the relative amounts of proHB-EGF on the cell surface must be determined. To verify that this method allows accurate measurement of the relative amount of proHB-EGF on the cell surface, we performed a model experiment. LC cells transfected with human DTR/proHB-EGF cDNA were mixed with untransfected LC cells at various ratios, and the cells were treated with anti-human proHB-EGF antibody and 125I-labeled secondary antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, the amount of 125I-labeled secondary antibody bound is proportional to the number of transfected cells added. Similar results were obtained using L cells as recipients (data not shown). Table I shows the amount of proHB-EGF expressed on the cell surface and the amount of 125I-DT bound to the L cells transfected with each mutant plasmid. The DT binding activities, obtained by dividing the specific binding of DT by the amount of proHB-EGF expressed on the cell surface, are also shown. Among the 10 single mutants, the largest effect was seen with E141H, for which no DT binding activity was detected using this binding assay. The second largest effects were seen with F115Y and L127F, for which DT binding activity decreased by about 86 and 817, respectively. Smaller effects were seen with K122R, I133K, H135L, and S147T, for which DT binding activity decreased by about 31, 64, 51, and 167, respectively. The other three single mutants, V124L, K125Q, and A129T, did not show significant effects on DT binding activity.Table IDT binding activity of mutant diphtheria toxin receptor proteins expressed in L cellsProteinA proHB-EGF on the cell surfaceB 125I-DT bound to the cellsDT binding activity B/AAverage DT binding activityRelative DT binding activityarbitrary units/10 6 cellsng/10 6 cells7 WTHuman proHB-EGF (WT)48.14.120.0860.089 (0.0042)10050.04.280.08642.23.990.095F115Y50.50.580.0120.012 (0.00047)1448.30.570.01250.00.570.011K122R33.72.070.0610.061 (0.0013)6935.32.170.06236.32.130.059V124L51.53.920.0760.080 (0.0033)9045.73.850.08445.53.630.080K125Q40.23.520.0880.083 (0.0037)9345.43.600.07942.33.470.082L127F39.90.690.0170.017 (0)1940.60.700.01738.30.650.017A129T27.92.720.0970.097 (0.0042)11025.62.660.10428.62.680.094I133K41.81.290.0310.032 (0.0013)3639.11.270.03236.01.210.034H135L33.91.500.0440.044 (0.00082)4933.61.520.04536.51.570.043E141H34.7000038.00032.600S147T36.32.610.0720.075 (0.0022)8433.12.530.07633.12.550.077F115Y/K122R/28.00000V124L/K125Q/29.300L127F/A129T/27.800I133K/H135L/E141H/S147T(mouse proHB-EGF)The amounts of proHB-EGF expressed on the cell surface and the amounts of DT bound to the cells were determined as described under 舠Experimental Procedures舡 by using 1 × 105transfected cells and 1 × 106 transfected cells, respectively.

DT binding activities of the mutant DTR/proHB-EGF proteins expressed in LC cells are shown in Table II. The E141H substitution also showed the largest effect on the DT binding in these cells, with DT binding activity decreased by about 917. F115Y and L127F also showed reduced binding activity, but the other seven single mutants, K122R, V124L, K125Q, A129T, I133K, H135L, and S147T, did not have significant effects. Effects of combinations of substitutions were also studied. The multiple mutants F115Y/K122R/V124L/K125Q/E141H/S147T and A129K/I133K/H135L/E141H/S147T showed DT binding activity about 3 and 27 that of wild type, respectively. These values are lower than that of the single mutant E141H but higher than that of mouse proHB-EGF. The triple mutant, A129T/I133K/H135L, showed DT binding activity about 627 that of wild type despite the fact that single amino acid alternations in these three residues (Ala129, Ile133, and His135) did not show negative effects. This indicates that amino acid substitutions whose influence on DT binding was not apparent by testing of individual substitutions may collectively have significant effects.Table IIDT binding activity of mutant diphtheria toxin receptor proteins expressed in LC cellsProteinA proHB-EGF on the cell surfaceB 125I-DT bound to the cellsDT binding activity B/AAverage DT binding activityRelative DT binding activityEnhancement of DT bindingarbitrary units/10 5 cellsng/10 5 cells7 of WT-foldHuman proHB-EGF (WT)4.021.370.340.340 (0.000)1003.84.381.490.34F115Y3.760.790.210.220 (0.010)65183.050.700.23K122R4.041.190.290.320 (0.030)945.22.550.880.35V124L3.621.030.280.310 (0.030)913.92.340.790.34K125Q4.061.380.340.355 (0.015)1044.32.951.090.37L127F3.480.780.220.230 (0.010)68142.750.670.24A129T2.941.080.370.335 (0.035)993.41.770.530.30I133K4.041.170.290.315 (0.025)939.82.971.000.34H135L1.800.590.330.350 (0.020)1038.03.201.190.37E141H2.180.060.030.030 (0.000)8.8舒3.090.080.03S147T2.000.630.320.325 (0.005)964.33.791.240.33A129T/I133K/1.810.420.230.210 (0.020)62NDH135L1.950.370.19F115Y/K122R/1.870.020.010.010 (0.000)2.9NDV124L/K125Q/3.080.030.01E141H/S147TA129T/I133K/1.910.010.0050.00651.9NDH135L/E141H/2.640.020.008(0.0015)S147TF115Y/K122R/2.24<0.01<0.004<0.0045<1.5舒V124L/K125Q/2.18<0.01<0.005L127F/A129T/I133K/H135L/E141H/S147T(mouse proHB-EGF)The amounts of proHB-EGF expressed on the cell surface and the amounts of DT bound to the cells were determined as described under 舠Experimental Procedures舡 by using 1 × 105transfected cells.

To assess the effect of each single amino acid alternations introduced in the EGF-like domain by a different system, GST fusion proteins containing wild-type and mutant forms of the EGF-like domain of human DTR/proHB-EGF were made, and DT binding activities were determined in a cell-free system (Table III). As in the transfection assays, DT binding activity was greatly reduced with E141H, and F115Y and L127F showed reductions of 51 and 687. Smaller effects were seen with K122R, A129T, I133K, and H135L.

Specific binding was determined by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding obtained using125I-DT alone. Data are shown as averages of five experiments. Standard deviations are shown after each value. Both human and mouse HB-EGF bind to EGF-receptor and have mitogenic activity. Substitution of amino acid residues in the EGF-like domain of human DTR/proHB-EGF by the corresponding amino acid residues in the mouse protein is therefore not expected to result in an undesirable change in the overall structure of the EGF-like domain. However, this approach has a limitation for evaluating the effects of substitutions at different sites. In the case of F115Y, K122R, V124L, L127F, and S147T, the amino acid substitutions are relatively homologous amino acid residues, whereas the substitutions in K125Q, I133K, H135L, and E141H involve nonhomologous or oppositely charged amino acid residues. Generally, substitution with a nonhomologous or oppositely charged amino acid would influence the activity more strongly than substitution with a homologous amino acid. Thus the failure to observe an effect of the substitutions used in this study does not necessarily indicate that the site does not play a role in DT binding, and further analysis is necessary to clarify the contributions of such sites. Nevertheless, the reduced binding activities of F115Y, L127F, and E141H are prominent among the mutants studied here. In all three DT binding assays, transfection into L cells or LC cells or binding of recombinant GST fusion proteins, the E141H substitution showed the largest effect, as indicated in earlier studies (33Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 40Hooper K.P. Eidels L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reduced DT binding activity of F115Y and L127F was also observed in all three binding assays, even though both mutants involve substitution of a nonpolar amino acid residue by another residue of the same type. We conclude that these three substitutions are most critical for the loss of DT binding activity in mouse proHB-EGF. DRAP27/CD9 associates with DTR/proHB-EGF and enhances its DT binding activity. When DT binding activities of the mutant DTR proteins expressed in L cells were compared with their binding activities in LC cells, enhancement of DT binding was observed for all of the single mutants in the presence of DRAP27/CD9 (compare Table I with TableII). Thus, the single amino acid alternations introduced in this study do not block the enhancement DT binding by human DTR/proHB-EGF. Although the tertiary structure of the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF has not been determined, the solution structures of the EGF-like domains of EGF and TGF-α were determined by NMR studies (34Harvey T.S. Wilkinson A.J. Tappin M.J. Cooke R.M. Campbell I.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41Montelione G.T. Wuthrich K. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Scheraga H.A.

Nature. 1987; 327: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). All members of the EGF family of growth factors, including HB-EGF, have six conserved cysteine residues and several other conserved amino acids in their EGF-like domains. Furthermore, HB-EGF, EGF, and TGF-α all bind to the EGF receptor. Therefore, we expect the main chain folds of the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF to be similar to those of EGF and TGF-α. Because HB-EGF and TGF-α have the same number of the amino acid residues inside the EGF-like domain and EGF has one additional amino acid residue between the second and third cysteine residues, we chose TGF-α as the template structure for a computer model of the tertiary structure of the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF. Human HB-EGF and mouse HB-EGF bind to same EGF receptor, and mouse HB-EGF is as mitogenic for cells as human HB-EGF. Thus, the main chain structures of the EGF-like domain are not likely to be greatly affected by substitution of amino acid residues in the human DTR/proHB-EGF sequence with corresponding amino acid residues in mouse proHB-EGF. Fig. 3 shows two views of the model in different orientations. In the model, the three amino acid residues critical for DT binding activity, Phe115, Leu127, and Glu141, are all located on the same face. We propose that the face containing Phe115, Leu127, and Glu141 is important for DT recognition by the EGF-like domain of DTR/proHB-EGF and that these residues play roles in DT binding. The other seven amino acid residues in the EGF-like domain that differ between human and mouse, except for Ala129, are located on other faces. Although Ala129 is on the same face as Phe115, Leu127, and Glu141, A129T did not show significantly decreased DT binding activity. Ala129 may not be involved in DT recognition or Ala129 may be involved in DT recognition, but the homologous substitution Thr for Ala may not have a significant effect. Reduced DT binding activity was observed with K122R, I133K, and H135L in the absence of DRAP27/CD9 (Table I and III) but not in the presence of DRAP27/CD9 (Table II). The presence of DRAP27/CD9 may compensate for the negative effects of these mutants by interacting with DTR/proHB-EGF. The tertiary structure model predicts that amino acid residues Lys122, Ile133, and His135are located on the face opposite the one containing Phe115, Leu127, and Glu141. Therefore, it is intriguing to speculate that DRAP27/CD9 interacts with the face on which Lys122, Ile133, and His135 are located and helps stabilize the structure of DTR/proHB-EGF, reducing the effects of the substitutions. In human amphiregulin, amino acid residues Phe115, Leu127, and Glu141 are conserved, but DT does not bind to human amphiregulin (33Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Whereas amino acid residues Phe115, Leu127, and Glu141 are important for the interaction of HB-EGF with DT, other residues within the EGF-like domain also affect DT recognition. Amino acid residues conserved in both human and mouse HB-EGF probably participate in DT recognition, especially amino acid residues located in the face including Phe115, Leu127, and Glu141. Alanine replacements in DT indicated that residues Lys516 and Phe530, located within a loop of the R-domain of DT, are involved in DTR recognition (5Shen W.H. Choe S. Eisenberg D. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29077-29084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All three amino acid residues that we identified as critical for DT binding activity are located in a loop in the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF. It is likely that DT-DTR interactions are mediated through these loops. It would be interesting to examine whether Lys516 and Phe530 of DT interact directly with Phe115, Leu127, or Glu141 of DTR/proHB-EGF. Further site-directed mutagenesis studies of DT and DTR/proHB-EGF can provide more precise understanding of DT-DTR interactions. Another approach to the study of DT-DTR interaction would be structural analysis of the DT-DTR complex. An analysis of the crystal structure of DT·HB-EGF complex is under way by S. Choe and associates in the Salk Institute. Their results also suggest that Phe115, Leu127, and Glu141 of the DTR/proHB-EGF are located in the face interacting with DT. 2S.

Multiple conjugation of ॆ125-(41–65) to carrier proteins enhances its antagonist activity but also confers partial agonist activity as measured by DNA synthesis inhibition. These results suggest that the (W/R)XXD motif is important for the activities of these TGF-ॆ peptide antagonists and that this motif may be the active site sequence of TGF-ॆ. Transforming growth factor ॆ (TGF-ॆ) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various human diseases. Synthetic TGF-ॆ antagonists therefore could have therapeutic utility. Here we show the development of such compounds. Three synthetic pentacosapeptides designated ॆ125-(41–65), ॆ225-(41–65), and ॆ325-(41–65), whose amino acid sequences correspond to the 41st to 65th amino acid residues of TGF-ॆ1, TGF-ॆ2, and TGF-ॆ3, respectively, inhibit the binding of 125I-labeled TGF-ॆ isoforms to TGF-ॆ receptors in mink lung epithelial cells with IC50 of ∼0.06–2 ॖm. ॆ125-(41–65) blocks TGF-ॆ1-induced growth inhibition and TGF-ॆ1-induced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression in these cells. The variants designated ॆ125-(41–65)W52A/D55A and ॆ325-(41–65)R52A/D55A, in which both Trp52/Arg52 and Asp55are replaced by alanine residues, do not have TGF-ॆ antagonist activity. Multiple conjugation of ॆ125-(41–65) to carrier proteins enhances its antagonist activity but also confers partial agonist activity as measured by DNA synthesis inhibition. These results suggest that the (W/R)XXD motif is important for the activities of these TGF-ॆ peptide antagonists and that this motif may be the active site sequence of TGF-ॆ. Transforming growth factor ॆ (TGF-ॆ) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF, transforming growth factor; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CA, carbonic anhydrase; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate. is a family of 25-kDa structurally homologous dimeric proteins containing one interchain disulfide bond and four intrachain disulfide bonds (1Massagué J.

TGF-ॆ is a bifunctional growth regulator: it is a growth inhibitor for epithelial cells, endothelial cells, T-cells, and other cell types and a mitogen for mesenchymal cells (1Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

TGF-ॆ also has other biological activities, including stimulation of collagen, fibronectin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) synthesis, stimulation of angiogenesis, and induction of differentiation in several cell lineages (1Massagué J.

TGF-ॆ has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases such as intimal hyperplasia following angioplasty, tissue fibrosis, and glomerulonephritis (4Border W.A. Noble N.A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1000-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5Border W.A. Noble N.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 655-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Neutralizing antibodies to TGF-ॆ have been used experimentally to reduce scarring of wounds, to prevent lung injury in adult respiratory distress syndrome, and to block restenosis following angioplasty in animal models (4Border W.A.

These promising results warrant the development of synthetic TGF-ॆ antagonists that might be useful in treating human diseases. We have investigated the structure and function of the type V TGF-ॆ receptor (9O'Grady P. Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21033-21037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which plays an important role in mediating TGF-ॆ-induced growth inhibition (11Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18891-18895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We felt it would be possible to develop TGF-ॆ antagonists with specificities toward the type V TGF-ॆ receptor and other TGF-ॆ receptor types (type I, type II, and type III receptors). In this article, we show that three chemically synthesized pentacosapeptides, ॆ125-(41–65), ॆ225-(41–65), and ॆ325-(41–65), whose amino acid sequences were derived from and correspond to the 41st to 65th amino acid residues of TGF-ॆ1, TGF-ॆ2, and TGF-ॆ3, inhibit the binding of radiolabeled TGF-ॆ1, TGF-ॆ2, and TGF-ॆ3 to TGF-ॆ receptors in mink lung epithelial cells. We also show that the (W/R)XXD motif in the sequences determines their potencies and that they block TGF-ॆ-induced growth inhibition and TGF-ॆ-induced expression of PAI-1 in mink lung epithelial cells. Finally, we show that these TGF-ॆ peptide antagonists can be converted to partial agonists by conjugation to protein carriers. Na125I (17 Ci/mg) and [methyl-3H]thymidine (67 Ci/mmol) were purchased from ICN Radiochemicals (Irvine, CA). High molecular mass protein standards (myosin, 205 kDa; ॆ-galactosidase, 116 kDa; phosphorylase, 97 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa), chloramine T, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and human carbonic anhydrase I (CA) were purchased from Sigma. Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL). TGF-ॆ1 was purchased from Austral Biologicals (San Ramon, CA). TGF-ॆ2 and TGF-ॆ3 were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The amino acid sequences of all pentacosapeptides and decapeptides were derived from those of TGF-ॆ1, TGF-ॆ2, and TGF-ॆ3. For pentacosapeptides ॆ125-(41–65), ॆ225-(41–65), and ॆ325-(41–65), other versions in which cysteine 44 and cysteine 48 were replaced by serine residues were also synthesized. These C44S/C48S versions of ॆ125-(41–65) and ॆ225-(41–65), and ॆ325-(41–65) had the same TGF-ॆ antagonist activity. The C44S/C48S versions had better stability in solution during storage, so they were used in most of the experiments. The peptides were synthesized using tert-butoxycarbonyl chemistry on an Applied Biosystems Model 431A peptide synthesizer and purified using Sephadex G-25 column chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (C-8 column). The purity of the synthesized peptides was verified by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems Model 477A gas-liquid phase protein sequenator with an on-line Applied Biosystems Model 120A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. The purity of all peptides was estimated to be ≧957. One hundred fifty ॖl of 3 mmॆ125-(41–65) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH adjusted to ∼9.0) was mixed with 300 ॖl of 0.1m NaHCO3 (pH ∼9.0) containing BSA or CA (0.5 mg) and 10 ॖl of 27 mm DSS in dimethyl sulfoxide. After 18 h at 4 °C, the reaction mixture was mixed with 50 ॖl of 1m ethanolamine HCl in 0.1 m NaHCO3(∼pH 9.0). After 2 h at room temperature, the reaction mixture was dialyzed against 2 liters of 0.1 m NaHCO3(∼pH 9.0). After four changes of the dialysis solution, the sample was stored at 4 °C prior to use. The molar ratio of ॆ125-(41–65)/carrier protein in the conjugate was determined by amino acid composition analysis. 125I-TGF-ॆ1,125I-TGF-ॆ2, and125I-TGF-ॆ3 were prepared by iodination of TGF-ॆ1, TGF-ॆ2, and TGF-ॆ3with Na125I as described previously (12O'Grady P. Kuo M.-D. Baldassare J.J. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8583-8589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13O'Grady P. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivities of 125I-TGF-ॆ1,125I-TGF-ॆ2, and125I-TGF-ॆ3 were 1–3 × 105cpm/ng. Mink lung epithelial cells were grown on 24-well clustered dishes to near confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 107 fetal calf serum. The epithelial cells were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-TGF-ॆ1,125I-TGF-ॆ2, or125I-TGF-ॆ3 both with and without 100-fold excess of unlabled TGF-ॆ1, TGF-ॆ2, or TGF-ॆ3 in binding buffer (12O'Grady P. Kuo M.-D. Baldassare J.J. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8583-8589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13O'Grady P. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After 2.5 h at 0 °C, the cells were washed two times with binding buffer, and the cell-associated radioactivity was determined. The specific binding of125I-labeled TGF-ॆ isoforms to TGF-ॆ receptors in the cells was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding (in the presence of 100-fold excess of the unlabled TGF-ॆ isoforms) from total binding. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Mink lung epithelial cells grown on 60-mm Petri dishes were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-TGF-ॆ1 in the presence of various concentrations of ॆ125-(41–65) or ॆ325-(41–65) in binding buffer (12O'Grady P. Kuo M.-D. Baldassare J.J. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8583-8589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13O'Grady P. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After 2.5 h at 0 °C,125I-TGF-ॆ1-affinity labeling was carried out in the presence of DSS as described previously (11Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18891-18895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12O'Grady P. Kuo M.-D. Baldassare J.J. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8583-8589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The125I-TGF-ॆ1 affinity-labeled TGF-ॆ receptors were analyzed by 57 SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and autoradiography. Mink lung epithelial cells grown on 24-well clustered dishes were incubated with various concentrations of TGF-ॆ1 in the presence and absence of ॆ125-(41–65) or with various concentrations of ॆ125-(41–65)-CA and ॆ125-(41–65)-BSA in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.17 fetal calf serum. After 16 h at 37 °C, the cells were pulsed with 1 ॖCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine for 4 h. The cells were then washed twice with 1 ml of 107 trichloroacetic acid and once with 0.5 ml of ethanol:ether (2:1, v/v). The cells were then dissolved in 0.4 ml of 0.2 n NaOH and counted with a liquid scintillation counter. Mink lung epithelial cells were grown overnight in 12-well clustered dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 107 fetal calf serum. The medium was then changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.17 fetal calf serum and the cells were incubated with 0.25 and 2.5 pmTGF-ॆ1 in the presence of various concentrations of ॆ125-(41–65) for 2.5 h. Total cellular RNA was extracted using RNAzol B (Tel-Test Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was electrophoresed in 1.27 agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to Duralon-UV membranes using 10 × SCC. The membranes were probed at 42 °C with a random-primed, radiolabeled 1-kilobase fragment from theHindIII and NeoI digests of PAI-1 cDNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. The blots were washed with 0.1 × SCC containing 0.17 SDS at room temperature. Synthetic oligopeptides containing an active-site amino acid sequence can be inhibitors or antagonists of their parent protein molecules (14Engström U. Engström A. Ernlund A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16581-16587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To develop synthetic peptide antagonists of TGF-ॆ, we therefore synthesized seven pentacosapeptides ॆ125-(21–45), ॆ125-(31–55), ॆ125-(41–65), ॆ125-(51–75), ॆ125-(61–85), ॆ125-(71–95), and ॆ125-(81–105), whose amino acid sequences overlap one another and cover most of the human TGF-ॆ1 molecule, the monomer of which has 112 amino acid residues (15Derynck R. Jarrett J.A. Chen E.Y. Eaton D.H. Bell J.R. Assoian R.K. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1985; 316: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). The antagonist activities of these peptides were first tested for their abilities to inhibit 125I-labeled TGF-ॆ1 (125I-TGF-ॆ1) binding to cell-surface TGF-ॆ receptors in mink lung epithelial cells, a standard model system for investigating TGF-ॆ receptor types and TGF-ॆ-induced cellular responses (16Boyd F.T. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2272-2278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cheifetz S. Hernandez H. Laiho M. ten Dijke P. Iwata K.K. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20533-20538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Laiho M. Weis F.M.B. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18518-18524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ॆ125-(41–65), whose amino acid sequence corresponds to the 41st to 65th amino acid residues of TGF-ॆ1, completely inhibited the125I-TGF-ॆ1 binding (specific binding without peptides = 3672 ± 524 cpm/well) to TGF-ॆ receptors in mink lung epithelial cells at 34 ॖm. The other six pentacosapeptides did not show any effect on125I-TGF-ॆ1 binding to TGF-ॆ receptors in these epithelial cells even at a concentration of 136 ॖm. This suggests that ॆ125-(41–65) is a TGF-ॆ inhibitor or antagonist and may contain an active site amino acid sequence of TGF-ॆ1. TGF-ॆ isoforms (TGF-ॆ1, TGF-ॆ2, and TGF-ॆ3) have been shown to exhibit different potencies in inducing cellular responses in certain cell types or systems (7Shah M. Foreman D.M. Ferguson M.W.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 985-1002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is ∼707 amino acid sequence homology at the 41st to 65th amino acid residues among these three TGF-ॆ isoforms (15Derynck R. Jarrett J.A. Chen E.Y. Eaton D.H. Bell J.R. Assoian R.K. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1985; 316: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 19Madison L. Webb N.R. Rose T.M.

Coffey R.J. Moses H.L. Chen E.Y. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3737-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To determine the potencies of ॆ125-(41–65), ॆ225-(41–65), and ॆ325-(41–65) in terms of TGF-ॆ antagonist activity, we measured the effects of these peptides on the binding of 125I-labeled TGF-ॆ1, TGF-ॆ2, and TGF-ॆ3 to TGF-ॆ receptors in mink lung epithelial cells. As shown in Fig.1, both ॆ125-(41–65) and ॆ225-(41–65) inhibited125I-TGF-ॆ1 and125I-TGF-ॆ2 binding to TGF-ॆ receptors in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of ∼1–2 ॖm (Fig. 1, A and B). ॆ325-(41–65) was weaker with an IC50 of ∼20 ॖm for inhibiting125I-TGF-ॆ1 and125I-TGF-ॆ2 binding to TGF-ॆ receptors (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, ॆ125-(41–65) and ॆ325-(41–65) showed equal potency (IC50 = ∼0.06–0.08 ॖm) when125I-TGF-ॆ3 was used as ligand for testing the inhibitory activity (Fig. 1 C). ॆ225-(41–65) also had an IC50 of ∼0.08 ॖm for inhibiting125I-TGF-ॆ3 binding to TGF-ॆ receptors in these epithelial cells (data not shown). These results show that both ॆ125-(41–65) and ॆ225-(41–65) are more potent antagonists than ॆ325-(41–65) for125I-TGF-ॆ1 and125I-TGF-ॆ2, and that all three pentacosapeptides are potent antagonists for125I-TGF-ॆ3 with equal IC50. The region spanning residues 41–65 includes a loop in the three-dimensional structures of TGF-ॆ1 and TGF-ॆ2 (21Schlunegger M.P. Grütter M.G. Nature. 1992; 353: 430-434Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22Schlunegger M.P. Grütter M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Hinck A.P. Archer S.J.

This loop is accessible to solvent according to x-ray and NMR analyses (21Schlunegger M.P. Grütter M.G. Nature. 1992; 353: 430-434Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22Schlunegger M.P.

Wenker J. Torchia D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8517-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). There are two reasons why a WSXD (for TGF-ॆ1 and TGF-ॆ2) or RSXD (for TGF-ॆ3) motif in the loop is a good candidate site whereby these pentacosapeptides and their parent molecules could interact with TGF-ॆ receptors. The (W/R)SXD (52nd to 55th amino acid residues) motif is located on the exposed surface of the loop, and the side chains of the amino acid residues in the motif orient toward the solvent (21Schlunegger M.P. Grütter M.G. Nature. 1992; 353: 430-434Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22Schlunegger M.P. Grütter M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Hinck A.P.

Also, this motif may determine the affinities of ॆ125-(41–65), ॆ225-(41–65), and ॆ325-(41–65), and their parent molecules for binding to TGF-ॆ receptors. Both ॆ125-(41–65) and ॆ225-(41–65) share the same motif (WSXD) and have equal potencies (IC50 = ∼1–2 ॖm) for the inhibition of125I-TGF-ॆ1 binding to TGF-ॆ receptors. ॆ325-(41–65) possesses a distinct motif of RSXD and is a weaker inhibitor (IC50 of ∼20 ॖm). The K d values for TGF-ॆ1 and TGF-ॆ2 binding to the type V TGF-ॆ receptor are identical (∼0.4 nm), whereas theK d of TGF-ॆ3 binding to the type V receptor is higher (∼5 nm) (11Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18891-18895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that the (W/R)SXD motif is the active site of these peptides, we synthesized three decapeptides designated ॆ110-(49–58), ॆ210-(49–58), and ॆ310-(49–58) whose amino acid sequences correspond to the 49th to 58th amino acid residues of TGF-ॆ1, TGF-ॆ2, and TGF-ॆ3, respectively. The (W/R)SXD variants of these decapeptides in which the Trp52, Ser53, or Asp55residue was replaced by an alanine residue were also synthesized and designated ॆ210-(49–58)W52A, ॆ210-(49–58)S53A, and ॆ210-(49–58)D55A, respectively. The abilities of these decapeptides to inhibit125I-TGF-ॆ1 binding to TGF-ॆ receptors in mink lung epithelial cells were then examined. As shown in Fig.1 D, both ॆ110-(49–58) and ॆ210-(49–58) inhibited the125I-TGF-ॆ1 binding to TGF-ॆ receptors in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of ∼40–70 ॖm. ॆ310-(49–58) did not show any inhibitory activity at concentrations up to ∼300 ॖm. ॆ210-(49–58)S53A was equipotent with an IC50 of ∼40 ॖm. The other variants, ॆ210-(49–58)W52A and ॆ210-(49–58)D55A, failed to inhibit125I-TGF-ॆ1 binding to TGF-ॆ receptors in these epithelial cells. Identical experiments with ॆ110-(49–58)W52A, ॆ110-(49–58)S53A, and ॆ110-(49–58)D55A were also carried out, and the results were similar to those shown in Fig. 1 Dwith the ॆ210-(49–58) variants (data not shown). These results suggest that the WXXD motif is important for the inhibitory activity of the decapeptides ॆ110-(49–58) and ॆ210-(49–58). To prove that the (W/R)XXD motif is also important for the inhibitory activities of the pentacosapeptides ॆ125-(41–65) and ॆ325-(41–65), we prepared variants of ॆ125-(41–65) and ॆ325-(41–65), in which both Trp52 or Arg52 and Asp55 were replaced by alanine residues. These were designated ॆ125-(41–65)W52A/D55A and ॆ325-(41–65)R52A/D55A, respectively, and tested for their inhibitory activities. Fig. 1 D shows that ॆ125-(41–65)W52A/D55A and ॆ325-(41–65)R52A/D55A did not inhibit125I-TGF-ॆ1 binding to TGF-ॆ receptors. These results all support the hypothesis that the (W/R)XXD motif is involved in the interactions of the peptide antagonists with TGF-ॆ receptors. Mink lung epithelial cells express all known and well characterized TGF-ॆ receptors (type I, type II, type III, and type V receptors) (11Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

To determine the relative sensitivities of TGF-ॆ receptor types to inhibition by ॆ125-(41–65) and ॆ325-(41–65) with respect to ligand binding, we performed 125I-TGF-ॆ1-affinity labeling of cell-surface TGF-ॆ receptors after incubation of mink lung epithelial cells with 125I-TGF-ॆ1 in the presence of various concentrations of ॆ125-(41–65) and ॆ325-(41–65). As shown in Fig.2, all cell-surface TGF-ॆ receptors (type I, type II, type III, and type V receptors) were affinity-labeled with 125I-TGF-ॆ1 in the absence of the antagonists (lanes 7 and 13). ॆ125-(41–65) appeared to inhibit the125I-TGF-ॆ1-affinity labeling of all TGF-ॆ receptor types in a concentration-dependent manner (lanes 8–12). However, ॆ125-(41–65) inhibition of the125I-TGF-ॆ1 affinity labeling of the type V TGF-ॆ receptor was greater than its inhibition of other TGF-ॆ receptor types. The 125I-TGF-ॆ1 affinity labeling of the type V TGF-ॆ receptor was almost completely abolished by ॆ125-(41–65) at 2.3 ॖm, whereas the 125I-TGF-ॆ1affinity labeling of other TGF-ॆ receptor types was only partially inhibited (30–407) (Fig. 2, lane 10). This result is consistent with our previous observation that the affinity for TGF-ॆ1 binding to the type V TGF-ॆ receptor is ∼20–40-fold lower than those for TGF-ॆ1 binding to other TGF-ॆ receptor types (11Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18891-18895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ॆ325-(41–65) showed a weak activity in blocking the 125I-TGF-ॆ1-affinity labeling of the type V TGF-ॆ receptor (Fig. 2, lanes 2–5). We have demonstrated that ॆ125-(41–65), ॆ225-(41–65), and ॆ325-(41–65) are potent inhibitors for 125I-TGF-ॆ1 binding to TGF-ॆ receptors. To fulfill the criteria for TGF-ॆ antagonists, these pentacosapeptides have to be shown to block TGF-ॆ-induced cellular responses. One prominent biological activity of TGF-ॆ is growth inhibition. We investigated the effect of ॆ125-(41–65) on TGF-ॆ1-induced growth inhibition by exposing mink lung epithelial cells to various concentrations of TGF-ॆ1 in the presence of 18 ॖmॆ125-(41–65) and measuring cellular DNA synthesis. As shown in Fig.3 A, DNA synthesis inhibition induced by 0.025 and 0.25 pm TGF-ॆ1 was completely blocked by ॆ125-(41–55). In the presence of ॆ125-(41–65), the dose-response curve of TGF-ॆ1 shifted to the right. ॆ125-(41–65) blocked TGF-ॆ1-induced growth inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). It is important to note that ॆ125-(41–65) (0.1–36 ॖm) did not have an effect on DNA synthesis in the absence of TGF-ॆ1. These results suggest that ॆ125-(41–65) is a TGF-ॆ antagonist which blocks TGF-ॆ-induced growth inhibition. The other prominent biological activity of TGF-ॆ is transcriptional activation of collagen, fibronectin, and PAI-1. To see if ॆ125-(41–65) is able to block this activity, we investigated the effect of ॆ125-(41–65) on PAI-1 expression in mink lung epithelial cells stimulated by 0.25 and 2.5 pmTGF-ॆ1. As shown in Fig. 3 C, ॆ125-(41–65) completely blocked the PAI-1 expression stimulated by TGF-ॆ1 (lane 7 versus lanes 3 and 5). These results further support our contention that ॆ125-(41–65) is a potent TGF-ॆ antagonist. The dimeric structure of TGF-ॆ has been shown to be required for its biological activities (24Amatayakul-Chantler S. Qian S.W. Gakenheimer K. Böttinger E.P. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27687-27691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heteroligomerization of TGF-ॆ receptors induced by the TGF-ॆ dimer appears to trigger signaling (25Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). If ॆ125-(41–65) contains the active site sequence involved in the interaction of TGF-ॆ1 with TGF-ॆ receptors, one may be able to convert its antagonist activity to agonist activity by conjugating ॆ125-(41–65) to carrier proteins, such that the ॆ125-(41–65)-protein conjugates would carry multiple valences of the putative active site. To test this possibility, ॆ125-(41–65) was conjugated to carrier proteins CA and BSA using the cross-linking agent DSS. DSS mainly cross-links the α-amino group of ॆ125-(41–65) to the ε-amino groups of the carrier proteins. The ॆ125-(41–65)-BSA and ॆ125-(41–65)-CA conjugates contained ∼5–10 molecules of ॆ125-(41–65) per molecule of carrier protein. As shown in Fig.4 A, the ॆ125-(41–65)-CA conjugate inhibited125I-TGF-ॆ1 binding to TGF-ॆ receptors in mink lung epithelial cells with an IC50 of ∼0.05 ॖm. The ॆ125-(41–65)-BSA conjugate had a similar IC50 of ∼0.06 ॖm (data not shown). These IC50 are ∼20-fold lower than that of ॆ125-(41–65) prior to conjugation. In the control experiments, both BSA and CA conjugated without peptides did not have inhibitory activity. These results suggest that the multiple valences of the active site in the protein conjugates enhance its affinity for binding to TGF-ॆ receptors. This prompted us to look into the potential agonist activities of the ॆ125-(41–65)-protein conjugates. As shown in Fig. 4 B, both ॆ125-(41–65)-CA and ॆ125-(41–65)-BSA conjugates induced a small but significant growth inhibition as measured by DNA synthesis with an ED50 of ∼0.1 ॖm, although neither showed significant effects on the expression of PAI-1 in mink lung epithelial cells (data not shown). The growth inhibition (∼30–407) induced by 0.2 ॖmॆ125-(41–65)-CA could be abolished in the presence of 10 ॖmॆ125-(41–65) (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that these ॆ125-(41–65)-protein conjugates are partial TGF-ॆ agonists. The putative active site of TGF-ॆ involved in the interaction with TGF-ॆ receptors has not been defined. Qian et al. (26Qian S.W. Burmester J.K. Tsang M.L.-S. Weatherbee J.A. Hinck A.P. Ohlsen D.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol.

Evidently, this C-terminal site is not the primary site for interaction with TGF-ॆ receptors. Here, we propose that the (W/R)XXD motif is a primary site involved in the interaction with TGF-ॆ receptors. This proposal is supported by several lines of evidence including: 1) among seven pentacosapeptides whose amino acid sequences cover most of the TGF-ॆ1 molecule, only ॆ125-(41–65), which contains the (W/R)XXD motif in the middle of the peptide amino acid sequence, has TGF-ॆ antagonist activity; 2) pentacosapeptides and decapeptides containing this (W/R)XXD motif are potent TGF-ॆ antagonists; 3) replacement of Trp52/Arg52 and Asp55 by alanine residues abolishes the antagonist activities of these decapeptides and pentacosapeptides; 4) conjugation of the ॆ125-(41–65) antagonist to carrier proteins creates a partial TGF-ॆ agonist; 5) several proteins that possess (W/R)XXD motifs have TGF-ॆ agonist and antagonist activities (27Leal S.M. Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20572-20576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). 2S. S. Huang, M. Cerullo, F. W. Huang, and J. S. Huang, unpublished results. Our hypothesis that the (W/R)XXD motif in TGF-ॆ isoforms is involved in the interaction with TGF-ॆ receptors raises the question of how the TGF-ॆ receptors recognize differentially functional side chains of tryptophan and arginine residues in the (W/R)XXD motif of TGF-ॆ isoforms. We speculate that the functional groups in the TGF-ॆ receptor molecules responsible for recognizing the hydrophobic indole group of tryptophan in TGF-ॆ1 and TGF-ॆ2 and the charged guanidino group of arginine in TGF-ॆ3 may be in close proximity in the binding site (or pocket site) of the receptors. The RXXD motif may require more configuration restraint to be recognized by TGF-ॆ receptors. This possibility is supported by our observations that ॆ310-(49–58) failed to show TGF-ॆ antagonist activity when ॆ110-(49–58), ॆ210-(49–58), and ॆ325-(41–65) were able to do so, and that an ∼10–20-fold higher concentration of ॆ325-(41–65), compared with those of ॆ125-(41–65) and ॆ325-(41–65), was required to achieve maximal inhibition."

The temporal expression of the two mouse protamines is transcriptionally regulated in the testis. Recent studies have demonstrated that ubiquitous and testis-specific proteins bind to the promoter of the mouse protamine 2 (mP2) gene. We have performed in vitro transcription and mobility shift assays to characterize the functional significance of the protein-DNA interactions within 180 base pairs upstream of the mP2transcription start site. Deletion and mutational analyses reveal two positive regulatory sequences for mP2 transcription at positions −59/−47 and −83/−72 of the mP2 promoter. The proximal element at −59/−47 binds to a novel testis-specific protein we name protamine-activating factor 1 (PAF-1). PAF-1 reaches high levels in round spermatids at the time of mP2transcription. Deletion of the −59/−47 sequence results in about a 3-fold reduction of mP2 transcription in vitro. Although the PAF-1 binding site (PAF-responsive element, PAF-RE), contains the sequence GTCA present in the cAMP-responsive element and is very similar to the estrogen-responsive element, mobility shift assays revealed that neither the cAMP-responsive element modulator nor the estrogen receptor is the protein(s) binding to PAF-RE. Competition mobility shift assays reveal that the second positive regulatory element at −83/−72 binds a Y-box-binding protein. Using in vitro transcription assays, a 5-fold decrease in mP2transcription is seen when both the PAF-RE and this Y-box are deleted. These data suggest that the testis-specific PAF-1 and a Y-box-binding protein are needed to activate mP2 transcription in postmeiotic male germ cells.

Spermatogenesis is a unique process of cellular differentiation in which diploid testicular stem cells differentiate into haploid spermatozoa (1Bellvé A.R. Finn C.A. Reviews of Reproductive Biology.

Cambridge University Press, New York1986: 151-193Google Scholar). During meiosis and spermiogenesis, male germ cells undergo major morphological and biochemical changes. These changes are regulated by the stage-specific transcriptional and translational activation of a large number of genes under temporal and cell-specific regulation (3Eddy E.M. Welch J.E. O'Brien D.A. deKretser D. Molecular Biology of the Male Reproductive System. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 181-232Google Scholar). In addition to numerous testis-specific genes, many testis-specific variants of somatic genes are also expressed during spermatogenesis (2Hecht N.B. Rossant J. Pedersen R.A.

Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 347-373Google Scholar). In the mouse, there are two protamines, mP1 and mP2, which differ in size and amino acid sequence and are transcribed from genetically linked single copy genes (6Hecht N.B. Hnilica L. Stein G. Stein J. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 347-373Google Scholar, 7Balhorn R. Adolph K. Molecular Biology of Chromosome Function. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 366-395Crossref Google Scholar). The nuclear compaction of the sperm nucleus during spermiogenesis involves the sequential replacement of histones by transition proteins and then by protamines. These chromatin changes contribute to the cessation of transcription in the maturing spermatids. Since transcription of the two mouse protamine genes is temporally coordinated (8Kleene K.C. Distel R.J. Hecht N.B. Dev. Biol. 1983; 98: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it is likely that similar sequences in the 5′-flanking regions of the protamine genes participate in their regulation (9Johnson P.A. Peschon J.J. Yelick P.C. Palmiter R.D. Hecht N.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The promoters of the mP1 and mP2 genes have been used to direct transcription in transgenic mice. A 113-bp region of themP1 promoter from −150 to −37 successfully directs spermatid-specific transcription (10Peschon J.J. Behringer R.R. Brinster R.I. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Reprod. 1994; 50: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), including a testis-specific nuclear protein (Tet-1), which binds to an 11-mer sequence at −64. Tet-1 has been proposed to activate the transcription of mP1 (13Tamura T. Makino Y. Mikoshiba K. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4327-4332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, an 859-bp region of themP2 gene immediately upstream of the transcription start site confers specific expression in round spermatids (14Stewart T.A. Hecht N.B. Hollingshead P.G.

Analyses of the mP2 promoter by in vitro transcription assays have identified a potential positive regulatory region from −170 to −82 (15Bunick D. Johnson P.A. Johnson T.R. Hecht N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mobility shift assays of the mP2 promoter region from −140 to −23 have detected the binding of ubiquitous and testis-specific proteins (16Johnson P.A. Bunick D. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 44: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recent studies analyzing protein-DNA interactions within the proximalmP2 promoter by DNase I footprinting and mobility shift assays have identified five protein-binding sites (17Ha H. van Wijnen A.J. Hecht N.B. J. Cell Biochem. 1997; 64: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Site 1 (−64/−48) contains the single core motif AGGTCA recognized by orphan nuclear receptors that are believed to be important for gonadal and brain development (18Enmark E. Gustafsson J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Site 1 also contains a half-site of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) that binds CRE-binding protein (CREB) or CRE modulator (CREM) (19Delmas V. van der Hoorn F. Mellstrom B. Jegou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and a sequence similar to the estrogen receptor-responsive element (ERE) (20Klein-Hitpass L. Ryffel G.U. Heitlinger E. Cato A.C.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 647-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Site 2 has a putative Y-box at −83/−72, which binds a family of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, one of them capable of activating germ cell-specific transcription (21Wolffe A.P. Tafuri S. Ranjan M. Familari M. New Biol. 1992; 4: 290-298PubMed Google Scholar). A testicular Y-box protein has also been shown to bind to a putative Y-box at −489/−478 of the mP2 promoter (22Nikolajczyk B.S. Murray M.T. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To characterize and determine the functional significance of the DNA-protein interactions at sites 1 and 2 of the mP2promoter, in vitro transcription and mobility shift assays were performed. We find that both site 1 and site 2 are important to obtain maximal mP2 transcription in vitro and suggest that a novel orphan nuclear receptor and a Y-box-binding protein are essential to activate mP2 transcription during the late stages of spermatogenesis. The promoter-less pEcoRV(C2AT) plasmid, containing a G-free cassette, was derived from the plasmid p(C2AT)19 (23Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). DNA fragments representing various lengths of the mP2 promoter (Fig.2 A) were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Each of the 5′-primers used in PCR has an EcoRI site at its 5′-end. Their sequences are 5′-CAG AAT TCA AAG CAA GAT GAG TAA C-3′ (for Pr168); 5′-CCG AAT TCG CCC TCA CAG AGG GGA C-3′ (for Pr115); and 5′-CAG AAT TCT TTA CCT TTA TAT ATG AGC C-3′ (for Pr45). The 3′-primer (5′-TCC ACG TGG TGA TGA TGG TCT GG-3′) has an EcoRV site at its 5′-end. The PCR fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI and EcoRV sites upstream of the G-free cassette in pEcoRV(C2AT). The G-free cassettes together with their upstream mP2 promoter fragments were excised by digestion with EcoRI and SmaI and subcloned into theEcoRI and EcoRV sites of pBluescript SK(+) plasmids to generate plasmids Pr168, Pr115, and Pr45. The Pr67 plasmid was prepared by amplifying Pr115 with a pBluescript primer encompassing the unique EcoRI site (5′-AAT TCC TGC AGC CCG GGG GA-3′) and an mP2 internal primer (5′-GGG CCG ACA GGT CAC AGT GG-3′) starting at −67 of the mP2 promoter. The open ends of the PCR fragments were then phosphorylated and ligated. To construct Pr370, an mP2 promoter fragment from −870 to +11 was amplified by PCR using the 5′-primer (5′-GGA ATT CTG GCC TGG CAT GTG C-3′) and the 3′-primer (5′-TCC CCC GGG GGT GGT GAT GAT GGT-3′). Subcloning of this DNA fragment into the EcoRI andEcoRV sites upstream of the G-free cassette in pEcoRV(C2AT) generated Pr870. The mP2 promoter from −370 to +11 and the G-free cassette were then excised from Pr870 and subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pBluescript KS(+). To remove the Y-boxes and the protamine-activating factor 1 (PAF-1)-responsive element (PAF-RE) in Pr370, two specific PCR primers were synthesized for each construct. Each pair of the primers has matched restriction enzyme sites at their 5′-ends. The primer sets used for the mutations were 5′-CGG GAT CCA AAG TTA CTC ATC TTG C-3′ and 5′-CGG GAT CCG TTC CAG TCC TGC AAA CC-3′ (for Pr370ΔY1); 5′-GGA ATT CGG ATC CCA CCC TGC CC-3′ and 5′-GGA ATT CAT GGG GTG GGC CGA CAG G-3′ (for Pr370ΔY2); and 5′-GAA GGC CTC ACG GTT TAC CTT TAT ATA TG-3′ and 5′-GAA GGC CTT GCG TCG GCC CAC CCC-3′ (for Pr370ΔRE). Using these primer sets, the Pr370 construct was amplified by PCR, and the open ends of the PCR fragments obtained were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated. Double mutant constructs were similarly prepared by PCR using a Pr370 plasmid carrying the first mutation as DNA template. The sequences of all of the mP2promoter constructs used for in vitro transcription assays were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Populations of germ cells were fractionated by sedimentation through a linear gradient of 2–47 bovine serum albumin at unit gravity in a Staput chamber as described previously (24Hake L.E. Alcivar A.A. Hecht N.B. Development. 1990; 110: 249-257PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse liver and testis nuclear extracts used for in vitro transcription and mobility shift assays were prepared as described previously (25Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 26Yiu G.K. Murray M.T. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 1439-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein extracts from purified germ cells were prepared as follows. Mouse spermatogenic cells were isolated (24Hake L.E. Alcivar A.A. Hecht N.B. Development. 1990; 110: 249-257PubMed Google Scholar) and washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then resuspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.057 Nonidet P-40 and homogenized briefly on ice with a Kontes pellet pestle. Protease inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine, 17 aprotinin, 1 ॖg/ml pepstatin, and 1.1 ॖg/ml leupeptin) were added to buffer A to minimize protein degradation. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was washed twice in buffer A and resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 6.257 glycerol) containing protease inhibitors. After incubation on ice for 40 min, the nuclear suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and diluted with an equal volume of buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 207 glycerol). The protein concentrations determined by Bio-Rad protein assays ranged from 1 to 5 mg/ml. In vitro transcription was performed as described previously (23Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 27Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Testis nuclear extracts (60 ॖg) were incubated with 0.8–1.0 ॖg of DNA templates in 20 ॖl of reaction mixtures containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 26 mmKCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm CTP, 0.6 mm ATP, 36 ॖm UTP, 1 mm3′-O-methyl-GTP (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 10 ॖCi of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Corp.), 1 ॖl of RNasin RNase inhibitor (Promega), and 37 glycerol. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 45 min and were terminated by the addition of 0.3 ml of stop buffer (0.25 m NaCl, 17 SDS, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA) containing 20 ॖg of Escherichia coli tRNA and 50 ॖg of proteinase K. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the RNA samples were extracted once with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The samples were then washed once in 707 ethanol, vacuum dried, and dissolved in 6 ॖl of 987 formamide loading buffer. After heating at 90 °C for 5 min, the RNA samples were electrophoresed on 47 denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. The transcription levels of the various mP2 promoter constructs were quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with Klenow polymerase, purified in 157 nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and recovered by overnight elution in 0.5m ammonium acetate, 0.17 SDS, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The radiolabeled oligonucleotides were then extracted once with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5. Labeled DNA probes (2–4 × 104cpm) were incubated with 5–10 ॖg of protein extracts on ice for 20 min in a binding buffer containing 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1–3 ॖg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 127 glycerol. After incubation, the samples were resolved on 47 native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5), and the protein-DNA complexes were detected by autoradiography. For competition mobility shift assays, protein extracts were preincubated with unlabeled specific or nonspecific oligonucleotides for 15 min before the addition of labeled DNA probes. Mobility shift assays were performed as described above using radiolabeled DNA probes and liver or testis nuclear extracts. After the DNA-protein complexes were visualized in the wet gel by autoradiography, gel slices containing the complexes were excised from the polyacrylamide gels and the proteins were eluted at 37 °C for 4 h in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 20 ॖg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 17 Triton X-100. The eluted proteins were precipitated with ice-cold 507 acetone, washed once with ice-cold 807 acetone, and resuspended in SDS-loading buffer. After being heated at 95 °C for 5 min, the proteins were resolved on 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using the Bio-Rad Semi-Dry Trans-Blot SD system (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h with 57 nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.5m NaCl. After several washes with TBST (TBS containing 0.057 Tween 20), the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBST, 17 bovine serum albumin with polyclonal antibodies to the Xenopus germ cell-specific Y-box-binding protein at a dilution of 1:20,000 (28Murray M.T. Schiller D.L. Franke W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The filters were then washed with TBST and incubated for another hour at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Amersham) in TBST, 17 bovine serum albumin at a 1:8,000 dilution. After four final washes with TBST at room temperature, the Y-box proteins binding to the antibodies were detected by the ECL system (Amersham). DNase I footprinting analyses of the mP2 promoter from −370 to +4 revealed five protein-binding sites (17Ha H. van Wijnen A.J. Hecht N.B. J. Cell Biochem. 1997; 64: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins prepared from mouse liver and testis bind to sites 1, 2, and 4; whereas nuclear proteins from liver but not testis bind to site 3, and testis but not liver nuclear proteins bind to site 5. We denote the three protein-binding sites closest to the start of transcription (sites 1–3) as BS1 to BS3 (Fig. 1). BS1 contains the sequence AGGTCA recognized by orphan nuclear receptors (18Enmark E. Gustafsson J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and the sequence GTCA inside this motif is also a half-site of the CRE, the binding site of CREB or CREM (19Delmas V. van der Hoorn F. Mellstrom B. Jegou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). BS1 also has an element at −59 to −47 with 11 of 13 nucleotides present in the consensus sequence of the ERE (20Klein-Hitpass L. Ryffel G.U. Heitlinger E. Cato A.C.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 647-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). By sequence homology, there are two putative Y-boxes present at −148 and −83 (BS2) in the mP2 proximal promoter. Both of them have 9 out of 12 nucleotides identical to the Y-box consensus sequence of Xenopus germ cell promoters (21Wolffe A.P. Tafuri S. Ranjan M. Familari M. New Biol. 1992; 4: 290-298PubMed Google Scholar). To define in the proximal promoter of mP2 the importance of specific protein-DNA interactions on transcription, a series of 5′-deletion constructs containing various lengths of the mP2promoter were subcloned upstream of a 400-bp G-free cassette (Fig.2 A). Using these constructs with crude testis nuclear extracts, in vitro transcription assays generate transcripts of 411 nucleotides (Fig.3 A). A 331-nucleotide transcript from a construct containing 45 bp of the mP2promoter subcloned upstream of a 320-bp G-free cassette was used as a control for each of the deletion constructs (Fig. 3 A). Transcription of each altered promoter was expressed as a percentage of the activity of the Pr168 construct (Fig. 3 B). Removal of the distal Y-box at −148 in the Pr115 construct did not significantly decrease transcription. However, when both of the Y-boxes were deleted in Pr67, transcription was decreased to about 657 of the control. Removal of the two Y-boxes and the PAF-RE sequence from themP2 promoter dramatically reduced transcription to about 187 of the control Pr168. The greatly reduced transcription of Pr45 relative to Pr168 indicates that the proteins binding at BS1 and BS2 are crucial for the activation of mP2 transcription. To better define the importance of the protein-binding sites BS1 and BS2 in activating mP2 transcription, a series of mP2promoter fragments were generated in which the sequence elements at −59/−47 containing the PAF-RE or the Y-boxes at −148/−137 and −83/−72 were replaced by unrelated sequences (see Fig.2 B). No change in transcription was seen when the upstream Y-box at −148 (Pr370ΔY1) was removed, whereas deletion of the downstream Y-box at −83 (Pr370ΔY2) resulted in about a 407 reduction in transcription (Fig. 4). When both of the Y-box sequences were replaced with unrelated sequences (Pr370ΔY), the relative transcription was reduced to about 507 of the control transcription. These data are consistent with our findings with the deletion constructs demonstrating that the proximal Y-box at −83 is more important than the more distal Y-box at −148 formP2 transcription (Fig. 3). Moreover, when the PAF-RE sequence was deleted (Pr370ΔRE), transcription was decreased to about 387, indicating the importance of this sequence element formP2 transcription. Transcription was further reduced to 237 of the control Pr370 construct when the two Y-boxes and the PAF-RE sequence element were removed (Pr370ΔY-RE). These results, in agreement with the 5′-deletion experiment (Fig. 3), confirm that the proximal putative Y-box at −83 and the PAF-RE at −59 are needed for maximal mP2 transcription. To characterize the protein factors that bind to BS1, mobility shift assays were performed with liver and testis nuclear extracts using a radiolabeled BS1 oligonucleotide as DNA probe. One DNA-protein complex (complex I) was detected with liver and testis nuclear extracts (Fig.5, lane 2), and two additional DNA-protein complexes (complexes II and III) were seen with testis nuclear extracts (Fig. 5, lane 6). To determine the specificity of protein binding to the BS1 DNA probe, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled specific or nonspecific DNA oligonucleotides was added to the binding reactions before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. Unlabeled BS1 oligonucleotides greatly diminished both the DNA-protein complex I seen with liver extracts (Fig. 5, lane 3) and the DNA-protein complexes I, II, and III seen with testis nuclear extracts (Fig. 5, lane 7). No reduction in liver or testicular protein binding was detected with a nonspecific competitor oligonucleotide containing binding site BS2 (Fig. 5, lanes 4and 8) or binding site BS3 (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and9). Since neither BS2 nor BS3 has homology to BS1, these data confirm the specificity of protein binding to BS1. To further characterize the nuclear proteins that interact with BS1, mobility shift assays were performed using a radiolabeled BS1 DNA probe and nuclear extracts prepared from the testes of mice at different ages. Complex I was detected in the testis nuclear extracts of 12-day-old or 17-day-old mice (Fig.6, lanes 1 and 2), and complexes II and III were first seen with nuclear extracts prepared from the testes of 22-day-old and adult mice (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 4). These data indicate that the complexes II and III become detectable at the same time that postmeiotic germ cells begin to differentiate. Since mP2 is expressed only postmeiotically, the mobility shift assays andin vitro transcription data suggest that specific nuclear proteins present in postmeiotic germ cells bind to the BS1 site at −64/−48 of the mP2 promoter and activate its transcription. To confirm which testicular cells express the proteins that form complexes II and III with the BS1 DNA probe, mobility shift assays were performed with nuclear extracts prepared from enriched germ cell populations (Fig. 6). Complex III was the major DNA-protein complex seen in the extracts from meiotic pachytene spermatocytes, although small amounts of complexes I and II were detected (Fig. 6, lane 5). The amounts of complexes II and III greatly increased in round spermatids (Fig. 6, lane 6), and elongated spermatids contain large amounts of complex III and a smaller amount of complex II (Fig. 6, lane 7). When equal amounts of proteins were assayed, we see that liver contains higher amounts of complex I than the differentiating germ cells (compare lane 8 tolanes 5–7 in Fig. 6). Mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts prepared from other somatic tissues and cells including kidney, spleen, Sertoli cells, and NIH 3T3 cells only detect complex I (data not shown). These data suggest that complex I is ubiquitous, whereas complexes II and III are germ cell-specific. Moreover, the amounts of complexes II and III increase greatly in round spermatids, the cell type in which protamine 2 is transcribed. Since BS1 contains a putative ERE and a half-site of CRE, we performed mobility shift assays to determine whether the estrogen receptor or CREM binds to the BS1 site. Radiolabeled BS1 probe and whole cell extracts prepared from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with human estrogen receptor were used in mobility shift assays. Although a prominent DNA-protein complex was detected with the CHO extract (Fig.7 A, lane 1), its mobility differed significantly from DNA-protein complexes I, II, or III (Fig. 7 A, lanes 2 and 3). When supershift experiments were performed using an antibody raised against the first 21 amino acids of the estrogen receptor, no change in electrophoretic mobilities or band intensities were observed for the DNA-protein complexes, suggesting that estrogen receptor is not the source of the protein in the DNA-protein complexes (data not shown). The transcriptional activator CREMτ is highly expressed in postmeiotic cells (29Foulkes N.S. Mellstrom B. Benusiglio E. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1992; 355: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 30Foulkes N.S. Schlotter F. Pévet P. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1993; 362: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It is a member of a group of transcriptional regulators called CREMs that mediate cAMP-dependent transcription. Recent studies of CREM-deficient mice have shown that CREM is essential formP2 transcription (31Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksén K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 32Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Weinbauer G.F. Nieschlag E. Schutz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Since BS1 contains a half-site of CRE, we performed mobility shift experiments with purified CREM-1 proteins using BS1 as probe. CREM-1 and CREMτ are two different CREM isoforms produced from the CREM gene by alternative splicing and are expected to have similar electrophoretic mobilities in native polyacrylamide gels (33Zhou Y. Sun Z. Means A.R. Sassone-Corsi P. Bernstein K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12262-12266Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Two major DNA-protein complexes formed between BS1 and CREM-1 (Fig. 7 B, lane 2). However, these DNA-protein complexes have different mobilities from those detected with liver (Fig. 7 B, lane 3) or testis (Fig. 7 B, lane 4) nuclear extracts. Thus, although purified CREM-1 binds to BS1, the DNA-protein complexes I, II, and III appear to be formed by other proteins. The BS2 protein-binding site identified by DNase I footprinting (17Ha H. van Wijnen A.J. Hecht N.B. J. Cell Biochem. 1997; 64: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) contains a putative Y-box sequence at −83 (Fig. 1). In gel shift assays using a radiolabeled BS2 oligonucleotide and nuclear extracts prepared from mouse liver, three major DNA-protein complexes are detected (Fig. 8,lane 2). The three DNA-protein complexes are dimini"
https://openalex.org/W2077281979,"We have detected DNA binding activity for a synthetic oligonucleotide containing an Sp1 consensus sequence in nuclear extracts from human chondrocytes. Changes in the levels of Sp1 oligonucleotide binding activity were examined in nuclear extracts from freshly isolated human chondrocytes, from chondrocytes that had been cultured under conditions that allowed the maintenance of a chondrocyte-specific phenotype on plastic dishes coated with the hydrogel poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), and from chondrocytes induced to dedifferentiate into fibroblast-like cells by passage in monolayer culture on plastic substrata. It was observed that Sp1 binding was 2–3-fold greater in nuclear extracts from dedifferentiated chondrocytes than in nuclear extracts from either freshly isolated chondrocytes or from cells cultured in suspension. The Sp1 binding activity was specific, since it was competed by unlabeled Sp1 but not by AP1 or AP2. The addition of a polyclonal antibody against Sp1 to nuclear extracts from freshly isolated chondrocytes or to extracts isolated from chondrocytes cultured in monolayer decreased the binding of Sp1 by ∼857. However, when the same experiment was carried out with nuclear extracts prepared from cells cultured on poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-coated plates, only a very slight inhibition of Sp1 binding was observed. When fragments of theCOL2A1 promoter containing putative Sp1 binding sites amplified by polymerase chain reaction were examined, it was found that the amounts of DNA-protein complex formed with nuclear extracts from dedifferentiated chondrocytes were 2–3-fold greater than the amounts formed with nuclear extracts from freshly isolated chondrocytes or from cells cultured in suspension. Quantitation of DNA binding activity by titration experiments demonstrated that nuclear extracts from fibroblast-like cells contained approximately 2-fold greater Sp-1 specific binding activity than nuclear extracts from chondrocytes. The direct role of Sp1 in type II collagen gene transcription was demonstrated by co-transfection experiments ofCOL2A1 promoter-CAT constructs in DrosophilaSchneider line L2 cells that lack Sp1 homologs. This is the first demonstration of Sp1 binding activity in human chondrocytes and of differences in Sp1 DNA binding activity between differentiated and dedifferentiated chondrocytes.

This is the first demonstration of Sp1 binding activity in human chondrocytes and of differences in Sp1 DNA binding activity between differentiated and dedifferentiated chondrocytes. The extracellular matrix of articular cartilage consists of a large number of tissue-specific macromolecules including type II, IX, and XI collagens and the large aggregating proteoglycan, aggrecan (1Eyre D.R. Wu J.-J. Woods P. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peryron J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, New York1992: 119-131Google Scholar). These extracellular matrix components are produced by chondrocytes, highly differentiated cells responsible for the maintenance of the structural integrity of the tissue through a precisely regulated balance between the synthesis and the degradation of these cartilage-specific macromolecules. The biosynthetic program of chondrocytes is determined by the highly conserved expression of a set of cartilage-specific genes (type II, IX, and XI collagens and the proteoglycan aggrecan), which is maintained during complex biological processes such as cartilage development, differentiation, and repair (2Von der Mark K. Kuhn K. Krieg T. Connective Tissue: Biological and Clinical Aspects. Karger, Basel1986: 272-315Google Scholar). Most of the studies that examined the stability of the chondrocyte phenotype have consistently shown that culture of these cells in monolayers on plastic substrata for prolonged periods or upon repeated passages leads to the loss of their spherical shape and to the acquisition of an elongated fibroblast-like morphology (3Von der Mark K.

These morphologic alterations are accompanied by profound biochemical changes including the loss of production of cartilage-specific macromolecules, initiation of synthesis of the interstitial collagens (types I, III, and V), and an increase in the synthesis of fibroblast-type proteoglycans (versican) at the expense of aggrecan (3Von der Mark K.

Few studies have been performed to characterize the transcriptional activity and regulation of the promoter of the cartilage-specific type II procollagen gene (COL2A1) despite the crucial role that its encoded product plays in the maintenance of the structure and function of articular cartilage. Structural and functional analyses of the promoter regions of COL2A1 have revealed multiple putative regulatory elements (13Vikkula M. Metsaranta M. Syvanen A.-C. Ala-Kokko L. Vuorio E. Peltonen L.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays employing bp −977 to −30 of the COL2A1 promoter and nuclear extracts from chick embryonic chondrocytes indicated the involvement of an Sp1-like factor in the cartilage-specific expression of the gene, since the addition of anti-Sp1 antibodies to the binding reaction caused a supershift of the DNA-protein complex (16Savagner P. Kresbach P.H. Hatano O. Miyashita T. Liebman J. Yamada Y. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, short mutations in the Sp1 binding sites abolished the formation of the DNA-protein complex (16Savagner P. Kresbach P.H. Hatano O. Miyashita T. Liebman J. Yamada Y. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). DNase I footprint analysis indicated that a sequence between bp −132 and −101 of the COL2A1 promoter bound nuclear proteins isolated from chick embryonic chondrocytes (16Savagner P. Kresbach P.H. Hatano O. Miyashita T. Liebman J. Yamada Y. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Western/Southwestern analyses showed that a protein complex that included Sp1 could bind to the COL2A1 promoter and enhancer under nondenaturing conditions and was dissociated under denaturing conditions. These results suggested the formation of a DNA loop structure between the COL2A1 promoter and enhancer that is mediated by nuclear proteins (16Savagner P. Kresbach P.H. Hatano O. Miyashita T. Liebman J. Yamada Y. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and clearly indicated the importance of transacting factors in the regulation of expression ofCOL2A1. However, studies of the changes in DNA-binding proteins that may occur during chondrocyte dedifferentiation have not been examined in detail, although one study showed that chondrocyte dedifferentiation was associated with the induction of nuclear factor binding activity for an AP-1 site and with a concomitant activation of pro-α1(I) collagen gene transcription (18Matta A. Glumoff V. Paakkonen P. Liska D. Penttinen P.K. Elima K. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the changes in the levels and activity of the transcriptional factor Sp1 occurring during the process of chondrocyte dedifferentiation. Human fetal epiphyseal cartilage was removed under sterile conditions from femoral heads, knee condyles, and tibial plateaus from spontaneous abortions. The tissues were obtained from the International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine (Philadelphia, PA), following protocols reviewed and approved by the National Institutes of Health and the Institutional Review Committee in accordance with the National Organ Transplant Act and the Pennsylvania Organ Transplant Act. To remove adherent fibrous tissues, the cartilage was incubated in Hanks' medium containing trypsin and bacterial collagenase (2 mg/ml each) for 1 h at 37 °C. The medium was discarded, and the tissue fragments were minced and digested overnight at 37 °C in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose containing 107 fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mg/ml bacterial collagenase. The cells released by the enzymatic digestion were filtered through a nylon membrane into a vessel containing fresh Dulbecco's minimum essential medium and 107 fetal bovine serum. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min, resuspended, and washed four times with collagenase-free medium. The average yield was 3.0 ± 0.4 × 108 chondrocytes/g, wet weight, of cartilage. The isolated chondrocytes were cultured at a density of 5 × 106 cells in 60-mm plastic dishes previously coated with 0.9 ml of a 107 (v/v) of polyHEMA 1The abbreviations used are: polyHEMA, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate); DTT, dithiothreitol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; bp, base pair(s).

The culture medium employed for these studies was Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 107 fetal bovine serum, 1000 units/ml penicillin, 1 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, 17 vitamin supplements, 2.5 ॖg/ml fungizone, and 50 ॖg/ml ascorbic acid. The medium was replaced every 3–4 days. The differentiated chondrocytes were those cultured on poly(HEMA) dishes. The dedifferentiated chondrocytes were those that were plated at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells on T75 flasks so that they would grow as attached cells in the same medium as that used for growing cells on poly(HEMA)-coated dishes and passaged twice at 20-day intervals. For Western blot analysis, freshly isolated chondrocytes, chondrocytes that had been cultured on poly(HEMA)-coated plates, and fibroblast-like chondrocytes that were passaged on plastic were utilized. The cells were suspended and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. They were heated to 100 °C for 5 min in 17 SDS, 50 mm DTT, and 17 (v/v) glycerol, and the cell-associated proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 67 polyacrylamide gels on a minigel apparatus at 125 V for 90 min. The proteins were electroblotted at 40 V for 90 min from the polyacrylamide gel onto a supported nitrocellulose membrane, and the transferred proteins were reacted for 30 min with a 1:500 dilution (v/v) of SJ 441 antibody, which is a polyclonal antibody specific for the COOH-terminal telopeptide of human type II collagen (22Jimenez S.A. Ala-Kokko L. Prockop D.J. Merryman C.F. Shepard N. Dodge G.R. Matrix Biol. 1991; 16: 29-39Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), or with an anti-type I human collagen polyclonal antibody purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). The proteins on the filter were detected utilizing the ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Corp.). Chondrocyte nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedures of Dignam et al. (23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The cells were pooled and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 137 mmNaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl). The resulting cell pellets were resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonic fluoride, and 0.5 mm DTT) approximately 5 times the packed cell volume and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 3 times the original packed cell volume in hypotonic buffer and incubated for 10 min on ice. Next, the cells were homogenized slowly with 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and the nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The nuclei were resuspended in one-half packed nuclear volume of low salt buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 257 glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.02 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonic fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT). This was followed by dropwise addition with continuous stirring of one-half packed nuclear volume of high salt buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 257 glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1.2 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonic fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT) and centrifugation at 14,500 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was next dialyzed against approximately 50 volumes of dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 207 glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonic fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT) for 5 h and then stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The resulting nuclear extracts were utilized for electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. The reaction was carried out as follows. 150 ng of α1(II) procollagen minigene, which contains the entire COL2A1 promoter region (24Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Ala-Kokko L. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21232-21237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was utilized as a template and was amplified with 10 pmol of each primer set (P1/P2, P3/P4, P5/P6, P7/P8; see Fig. 9) under the following conditions: 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min in a Gene Amp 480 thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer). Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses were performed according to the procedure of Garner and Revzia (25Garner M.M. Revzia A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), as described previously (26Jimenez S.A. Varga J. Olsen A. Li L. Diaz A. Herhal J. Koch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12684-12691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR products containing specific regions ofCOL2A1 prepared as described above were end-labeled by kinasing the 5′-primer with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and then carrying out the PCR reaction. The binding reaction was 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmsodium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 57 glycerol, and 10–15 ॖg of nuclear extract in a final volume of 20 ॖl. Next, 3–5 × 103 cpm of end-labeled probe was added, and the incubation was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 57 polyacrylamide gels in 40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA buffer and visualized by autoradiography. The specificity of binding of putative regulatory elements within the PCR fragments was confirmed by competition with unlabeled specific oligonucleotides (consensus Sp1, AP1, and AP2 oligonucleotides, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santabury, CA). Once the binding was determined to be specific, an anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was utilized. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as outlined above. Nuclear extracts were preincubated with increasing concentrations of the anti-Sp1 antibody for 60 min at 20 °C before the binding reaction was carried out. The level of Sp1-binding protein in nuclear extracts of chondrocytes was quantitated by protein titration experiments analyzed by gel shift analysis as described by Riggs et al. (27Riggs A.D. Suzuki H. Bourgeois S. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). One set of binding reactions contained a constant amount of labeled Sp1 and an increasing concentration of protein. The amounts of bound and free probe were quantitated by scintillation counting of excised regions of the gel. In the plateau region with excess protein, it was possible to determine the amount of protein required to reach equilibrium with the DNA probe. This reaction allowed determination of the proportion of DNA probe bound to protein, since under some conditions binding of probe is not complete even if there is excess protein present. The second set of titration experiments was performed under identical conditions except that the amount of protein determined from the first set of binding reactions was maintained constant while the amount of Sp1 oligonucleotide was increased. At plateau, all of the protein would be expected to be saturated with the Sp1 oligonucleotide. The counts per minute at plateau correspond to the amount of probe required to bind all of the active protein involved in DNA binding. By comparing the amount of probe in the DNA-protein complex to a set of standard dilutions of free probe included on a gel electrophoresed in parallel, the number of moles of protein in the reaction can be calculated assuming a one-to-one binding, since the specific activity and the molarity of probe was known. Drosophila Schneider line 2 cells (28Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar), which lack Sp1 homologs, were cultured in SchneiderDrosophila medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 127 heat-inactivated serum and 17 penicillin/streptomycin at 25 °C. The cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish 16 h prior to transfection. Transient transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with the Profection mammalian transfection system (Promega, Madison, WI). The transfections were performed using 100 ॖg of either pPacSp1 plasmid, which contains a 2.1-kilobase pair Sp1 cDNA insert or the insertless plasmid pPac0 (29Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) and 5 ॖg of either E/0.7-CAT, a human COL2A1 promoter construct spanning bp −577 to +63 linked to the CAT reporter gene or E/0.2-CAT, a human COL2A1 promoter construct spanning bp −131 to +63 linked to the CAT reporter gene. All of the reactions contained 0.5 ॖg of phsp82LacZ, a plasmid containing theDrosophila heat shock protein 82 promoter fused to thelacZ gene to correct for variations in transfection efficiencies. The transfected cells were harvested following a 48-h incubation, and CAT activity was determined from equal amounts of cell extracts as described previously (26Jimenez S.A. Varga J. Olsen A. Li L. Diaz A. Herhal J. Koch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12684-12691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from freshly isolated chondrocytes, from chondrocytes cultured on polyHEMA for 12 days under conditions that allow the preservation of the cartilage-specific phenotype, and from chondrocytes that lost their phenotype and became morphologically fibroblast-like by passage in monolayer culture on plastic for 40 days. The phase-contrast morphology of the three cell types is shown in Fig. 1. Western blot analysis of cell extracts isolated from the three different cell types indicated that culture of chondrocytes on polyHEMA allows preservation of the cartilage-specific phenotype as they continue to express type II collagen and not type I collagen (Fig.2). In contrast, culture and passage of chondrocytes in monolayer on plastic leads to loss of their chondrocyte-specific phenotype as these cells express markedly lower levels of type II collagen and initiate production of large amounts of fibroblast-specific type I collagen (Fig. 2).Figure 2Western blot analysis of collagens synthesized by cultured human fetal chondrocytes. The cell-associated proteins synthesized by chondrocytes cultured under the various conditions were extracted as described under 舠Experimental Procedures舡 and subjected to Western blot analysis utilizing either a polyclonal antibody specific for the type II procollagen telopeptide (22Jimenez S.A.

Lanes 1 and 4, freshly isolated chondrocytes. Lanes 2 and 5, chondrocytes cultured on polyHEMA. Lanes 3 and 6, chondrocytes dedifferentiated into fibroblast-like cells following passage on plastic. The position of migration of the α1 and α2 chains of type I collagen is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For detection of Sp1 binding activity, the consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) was radiolabeled and used as a probe in the binding assays. As shown in Fig.3, there was binding of nuclear proteins from freshly isolated chondrocytes and from fibroblast-like cells to consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide. However, the binding of nuclear extracts from dedifferentiated chondrocytes to Sp1 was 2–3-fold greater than the binding of nuclear extracts from freshly isolated chondrocytes. The results obtained from chondrocytes that were cultured on polyHEMA-coated plates in suspension were similar to those obtained from freshly isolated chondrocytes (data not shown). The binding of labeled Sp1 to nuclear extracts from both chondrocytes and fibroblast-like cells was competed away completely when a 10-fold excess of unlabeled Sp1 was added (Fig. 3). However, when unlabeled AP1 or AP2 was added to the reaction, the binding of labeled Sp1 was not competed away, indicating that the DNA-protein complexes were specific for Sp1 (Figs.4 and 5). Moreover, when the binding of recombinant Sp1 was carried out with the consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide, a DNA-protein complex of the same size as that observed upon binding of Sp1 to chondrocyte or fibroblast-like nuclear proteins was observed (not shown). The DNA-protein complex formed between recombinant Sp1 and consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide had the same pattern of migration as the complex formed by the consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide with nuclear proteins from either chondrocytes or fibroblast-like cells. The Sp1 binding with extracts from both chondrocytes and fibroblast-like cells was enhanced by the addition of increasing amounts of KCl as shown in Fig.6. Moreover, the addition of increasing amounts of EDTA inhibited the formation of the DNA-protein complex (Fig. 7). The inhibition of Sp1 binding by EDTA was abrogated when MgCl2 was added to the binding reaction, and when equal concentrations of EDTA and MgCl2were present (40 mm each) in the binding reaction no inhibition of Sp1 binding was observed. The inhibition of Sp1 binding by EDTA was not abrogated by the addition of ZnCl2. Thus, the formation of Sp1 protein complex requires the presence of Mg2+.Figure 5Competition analysis with unlabeled Sp1, AP-1, and AP-2. Binding of nuclear extracts with32P-labeled consensus Sp1 was carried out in the presence of a 10-fold excess of unlabeled Sp1, AP-1, or AP-2. The nuclear extracts were preincubated with unlabeled consensus Sp1, AP-1, or AP-2 at room temperature for 30 min followed by the addition of labeled consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide for 1 h at room temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Effect of increasing concentrations of KCl on binding of nuclear extracts isolated from chondrocytes and fibroblast-like cells to consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide.

However, when 15 ॖg of anti-Sp1 was added to the fibroblast-like nuclear extract, greater than 807 inhibition of the DNA-protein complex was observed (Fig.8). As illustrated in Fig. 9 A, four consensus Sp1 binding sites (GGGCGG) at nucleotides −80 to −75, −115 to −110, −119 to −114, and −198 to −193 have been identified in the humanCOL2A1 promoter. Three of these (at nucleotides −80, −119, and −198) are found at identical locations in the human, mouse, and rat COL2A1 promoters. The extremely high conservation of these sequences coupled with the observation that the CCAAT box is absent in the human COL2A1 promoter suggests that these Sp1 sites may play a major role in determining the activity of theCOL2A1 promoter. We amplified the region encompassing of theCOL2A1 promoter nucleotides −391 to −40 in four fragments designated P1/P2, P3/P4, P5/P6, and P7/P8 as shown in Fig. 9(A and B). As shown in Fig.10, we detected binding of chondrocyte nuclear proteins to COL2A1 promoter fragments spanning bp −226 to −148 (fragment P5/P6; Fig. 10, lane 1) and bp −169 to −40 (fragment P7/P8; Fig. 10, lane 7) from the initiation of transcription site. Since these fragments contain putative Sp1 sites, we examined the effects of added unlabeled Sp1 to the binding reaction. The formation of DNA-protein complexes with nuclear proteins from human chondrocytes was completely competed by a 10-fold excess of unlabeled Sp1, indicating that the Sp1 sites on P5/P6 and P7/P8 are involved in binding (Fig. 10, lanes 2 and8). The DNA-protein complex formed by each COL2A1promoter fragment was also competed by a 10-fold excess of corresponding unlabeled COL2A1 promoter fragment as shown in Fig. 10, lanes 3 and 9. In addition, P5/P6 competed the complex formed with P7/P8 in nuclear extracts isolated from chondrocytes and chondrocytes dedifferentiated into fibroblast-like cells (results not shown). Similar results were observed when nuclear proteins were isolated from chondrocytes dedifferentiated into fibroblast-like cells except that there was a 2–3-fold greater binding in nuclear extracts from dedifferentiated chondrocytes cultured in monolayer as compared with that from fresh chondrocytes (Fig. 10, lanes 4, 5, 6,10, 11, and 12). The amounts of nuclear proteins from chondrocyte and fibroblast-like cells that bind to the consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide were quantitatively determined by DNA-binding protein titration experiments. The first set of binding reactions contained a constant amount of labeled Sp1 oligonucleotide (88 nm) and increasing concentrations of nuclear protein. When the chondrocyte nuclear protein concentration was increased from 1 to 25 ॖg/reaction, an increase in the amount of DNA-protein complex formed was detected (Fig.11, A and B). Increasing the concentration of nuclear proteins in the reaction above 20 ॖg/reaction did not result in a further increase in binding, indicating that at this concentration equilibrium was reached with the labeled Sp1 oligonucleotide. Therefore, in the next set of reactions, the concentration of nuclear proteins was maintained constant at 20 ॖg/reaction, and the amount of Sp1 oligonucleotide was increased from 22 to 352 nm/reaction. As shown in Fig. 11, Cand D, the binding was essentially complete at a concentration of 264 nm. Thus, at the plateau of 264 nm, all of the DNA-binding protein was saturated with Sp1. Next, a set of standard dilutions of the free oligonucleotide ranging from 22 to 352 nm was electrophoresed, and the radioactivity of the free probe was determined (Fig. 11, Eand F). Comparison of the amount of oligonucleotide in the DNA-protein complex with a set of standard dilutions of free oligonucleotide demonstrated that 11.88 nm of chondrocyte nuclear protein was bound to the Sp1 oligonucleotide in the reaction, assuming a one-to-one binding of the probe and the Sp1 oligonucleotide. Similar experiments were performed with nuclear extracts isolated from chondrocytes dedifferentiated into fibroblast-like cells. Since the binding of 88 nm of Sp1 oligonucleotide was saturated at a protein concentration of 20 ॖg (Fig. 11, A andB) in the next set of reactions, 20 ॖg of protein was used per reaction, and the concentration of Sp1 oligonucleotide was increased from 22 to 352 nm/reaction. As shown in Fig. 11,C and D, the binding was essentially complete at a concentration of 264 nm, similar to that observed for chondrocyte nuclear protein. Comparison of the amount of oligonucleotide in the DNA protein complex to a set of standard dilutions of free probe demonstrated that 23.2 nm of nuclear protein isolated from chondrocytes dedifferentiated into fibroblast-like cells was present in the reaction (Fig.11 F). Therefore, the amount of nuclear proteins binding to the Sp1 oligonucleotide was about 2-fold higher in nuclear extracts isolated from chondrocytes dedifferentiated into fibroblast-like cells as compared with that of nuclear extracts isolated from chondrocytes. To provide direct evidence of the role of Sp1 in COL2A1 transcription, cotransfection experiments were performed with DrosophilaSchneider line L2 cells that lack homologs of Sp1. The construct E/0.7, which spans bp −577 to +63 of the COL2A1 promoter, was co-transfected with either the Sp1 expression plasmid pPacSp1 or the insertless plasmid pPac0, an identical plasmid lacking the Sp1 cDNA. The plasmid pSV2-CAT, which contains the SV40 promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene, or the plasmid pSV0-CAT, an identical plasmid but lacking the SV40 promoter, was used as positive or negative control, respectively. As shown in Fig.12, when E/0.7 was transfected alone or was co-transfected with pSV0-CAT into the Drosophila cells, no CAT activity was observed. However, when E/0.7 was co-transfected with pPacSp1, the Sp1 expression plasmid, substantial CAT activity was detected. When the construct E/0.2, which spans bp −131 to +63 was utilized in experiments similar to those with E/0.7, substantial CAT activity was obtained when it was co-transfected with the Sp1 expression plasmid pPacSp1. However, the CAT activity obtained with E/0.2 was >437 lower than that obtained with E/0.7. The higher CAT activity produced when E/0.7 was employed may be due to the presence of two additional Sp1 binding sites in the construct E/0.7 in comparison with E/0.2. The results reported here revealed qualitative and quantitative alterations in Sp1 binding activity during chondrocyte dedifferentiation. This conclusion is based on studies carried out with consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide showing that (i) Sp1 binding activity was present in nuclear extracts from all three cell types studied; (ii) Sp1 binding was 2–3-fold greater in nuclear extracts from chondrocytes dedifferentiated into fibroblast-like cells by passage in monolayer culture on plastic substrate than in freshly isolated chondrocytes or in chondrocytes allowed to maintain their phenotype by culture on polyHEMA-coated dishes; (iii) Sp1 binding was specific, since it was competed by unlabeled Sp1 and not by AP1; (iv) Sp1 binding was enhanced by KCl and inhibited by the addition of EDTA; (v) A polyclonal antibody against Sp1 decreased the binding of Sp1 by 857 in chondrocytes dedifferentiated into fibroblast-like cells but caused only a very slight inhibition in freshly isolated chondrocytes or in chondrocytes cultured in suspension on polyHEMA. Inhibition of Sp1 binding by this polyclonal antibody has been previously reported in the human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene promoter (30Jianping Y. Zhang X. Dong Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We also observed that culture of chondrocytes under conditions that result in the acquisition of fibroblast-like morphology resulted in an increase in DNA binding activity to COL2A1 promoter fragments containing Sp1 sites. The increase in binding to the consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide or to the COL2A1 promoter fragment could be due to several reasons. First, there may be an increased expression of the Sp1 gene. Increase in Sp1 mRNA has been observed in several organs during mouse embryo development (31Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Second, there may be post-translational mechanisms that are involved. These could be O-linked glycosylation, protein kinase phosphorylation, or formation of multimers on single or multiple GC elements. The differential antibody response observed in the two morphologically different cells types may indicate that the DNA-binding proteins are different in the two cell types although they have the same apparent molecular mass. Alternatively, it is possible that there are subtle differences in the binding of Sp1 oligonucleotide to the same nuclear protein in the two different cell types that are reflected in the differential antibody response. Quantitative analysis of the amounts of binding proteins employing DNA-binding protein titration assays demonstrated that 11.88 nm chondrocyte nuclear protein was bound to the consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide as compared with a 23.2 nm concentration of fibroblast-like cell nuclear protein. Drosophila Schneider L2 cells that lack homologs of Sp1 have previously been utilized in co-transfection experiments with the Sp1 expression plasmid and COL1A1 promoter-CAT constructs to demonstrate a direct role of Sp1 in the transcription of this gene (32Nehls M.C. Rippe R.A. Veloz L. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4065-4073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,33Liye Li Artlett C.M. Jimenez S.A. Hall D.J. Varga J. Gene. 1995; 164: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Higher stimulation of the COL1A1 promoter activity with CAT constructs containing progressively greater number of Sp1 sites has previously been reported (33Liye Li Artlett C.M. Jimenez S.A. Hall D.J. Varga J. Gene. 1995; 164: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The activity of the COL2A1promoter was also significantly increased by Sp1 expressed inDrosophila Schneider line L2 cells. Higher stimulation of promoter activity was observed when a COL2A1 construct containing a greater number of Sp1 sites was utilized. These results indicated a direct role of Sp1 in regulation of activity of theCOL2A1 promoter. Although Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is present in all mammalian cells that have been examined (34Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), it has been demonstrated that its binding affinity and transcriptional properties can be altered by different cytokines via indirect action with co-factors. The role of Sp1 in regulation of the α2(I) procollagen gene expression has been extensively studied (35Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Inagaki Y. Truter S. Tanaka S. Di Liberto M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3353-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-ॆ stimulates the expression of the α2(I) procollagen gene by increasing the affinity of an Sp1-containing transcriptional complex that is bound to a sequence in the promoter termed the transforming growth factor-ॆ-responsive element (35Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same element also mediates the transcriptional signal of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α that inhibits α2(I) procollagen gene expression (34Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very likely that Sp1 along with other co-factors may be involved in the regulation of expression of COL2A1 in chondrocytes. Our observations of reduced DNA binding of Sp1 in differentiated chondrocytes in comparison with fibroblast-like dedifferentiated chondrocytes can be proposed as a molecular mechanism that contributes to alterations in expression of COL2A1 and possibly other genes that are differentially regulated in the two cell types. Further studies to examine the specific sequences within the COL2A1promoter that interact with Sp1 and to identify the precise mechanism of Sp1 binding will further our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the profound changes in the expression of this gene occurring during the process of chondrocyte dedifferentiation or in diseases such as osteoarthritis.

Using intact S. pyogenes bacteria in which various domains of protein F were expressed as hybrids with the surface-exposed region of an unrelated protein, we revealed that, in contrast to the predominantly UR-mediated binding to soluble fibronectin, the maximal binding to the fibronectin matrix required RD2 in addition to UR. Since in some infections S. pyogenes may initially encounter a matrix form of fibronectin, these results suggest that UR and RD2 may be important for the initiation of streptococcal infectious processes.

Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), a glycoprotein found either as a soluble dimer in most body fluids including plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and amniotic fluid and as an insoluble multimer in association with cell surfaces, the extracellular matrix, and basement membrane (4Hynes R.O. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 5Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 375-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of fibronectin is that it is composed of distinct domains that bind to a number of proteins that include integrins, collagens, fibrin, gelatin, and heparin, as well as other proteins and nonprotein compounds (4Hynes R.O. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 5Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 375-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 6Wannamaker L.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1970; 282: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For bacteria that bind fibronectin, its multiple binding properties can contribute to the ability to colonize many different sites in the host. The interaction between fibronectin and the Gram-positive bacteriumStreptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) has been extensively studied. S. pyogenes is one of the most versatile human pathogens with regards to the number of different tissues it can infect and the wide range of different diseases it can cause, including suppurative infections of the throat (pharyngitis) and of the skin and soft tissues (impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and myositis). Several systemic infections can result from the production of different toxins (scarlet fever and toxic shock-like syndrome), and a host immune response to streptococcal antigens has been implicated to play a role in rheumatic fever. Each streptococcal infection is initiated by attachment and colonization of bacteria to epithelial cells of the pharyngeal mucosa or the skin (6Wannamaker L.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1970; 282: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence has accumulated to suggest that binding ofS. pyogenes to fibronectin promotes adherence to certain epithelial cells during infection (1Beachey E.H. J. Infect. Dis. 1981; 143: 325-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 7Hasty D.L. Ofec I. Courtney H.S. Doyle R. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Simpson W.A. Courtney H.S. Ofec I. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1987; 9: S351-S359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In S. pyogenes, several different fibronectin-binding proteins have been identified, including the 28-kDa antigen (9Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Dale J.B. Poirier T.P. Curr. Microbiol. 1992; 25: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), FBP54 (10Courtney H.S. Li Y. Dale J.B. Hasty D.L. Infect.

Med. 1992; 176: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), a serotype 3 M protein (12Schmidt K.H. Mann K. Cooney J. Kohler W. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), serum opacity factor/SfbII (13Rakonjac J.V. Robbins J.C. Fischetti V.A. Infect.

Microbiol. 1995; 17: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and protein H (15Frick I.-M. Crossin K.L. Edelman G.M. Björck L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Perhaps the best characterized streptococcal fibronectin-binding molecules are the closely related proteins SfbI (16Talay S.R. Ehrenfield E. Chhatwal G.S. Timmis K.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Talay S.R. Valentin-Weigand P.G.J.P. Timmis K.N. Chhatwal G.S. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3837-3844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and protein F (18Hanski E. Caparon M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6172-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that protein F contains two distinct fibronectin binding domains, a tandem repetitive domain (RD2), and a domain immediately N-terminal to the repetitive domain (UR, Fig. 1) (19Sela S. Aviv A. Tovi A. Burstein I. Caparon M.G. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavski I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The minimal functional binding unit of the RD2 repeat domain consists of 44 amino acids located at the junction of two adjacent sequence repeats and is flanked by an MGGQSES motif. This functional unit recognizes the N-terminal fibrin binding domain of fibronectin (20Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavski I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). UR contains 49 amino acids and consists of the 43 amino acids located immediately N-terminal to RD2 and the first six amino acids from the first repeat of RD2. This domain binds to a large region of fibronectin that includes both the N-terminal fibrin and adjacent collagen binding domains (20Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavski I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). UR binds fibronectin with high affinity and is the dominant domain for the binding of soluble fibronectin to protein F (20Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavski I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In tissues, fibronectin forms disulfide cross-linked fibrils (5Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 375-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that this tissue form of fibronectin is functionally distinct from that of the soluble form. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; III1-C, C-terminal two-thirds of the first type III repeat of fibronectin; III11, eleventh type III repeat corresponding to amino acids 1532 to 1599 of the fibronectin molecule; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. cells with an increased capacity to induce deposition of a fibronectin matrix due to overexpression of the α5ॆ1 integrin have a reduced capacity to migrate and lose their ability to cause tumors upon implantation into mice (21Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Also, a highly cross-linked multimer of fibronectin (superfibronectin) that resembles the natural tissue form of fibronectin enhances cell adhesiveness and reduces cell migration (22Morla A. Zhang Z. Rouslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Superfibronectin is induced to form in vitro in the presence of a fragment from the first type III repeat of fibronectin (22Morla A. Zhang Z. Rouslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), which is known to play an important role in the assembly of a fibronectin matrix (23Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19183-19187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hocking D.C. Smith R.K. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Apparently, the enhanced properties of superfibronectin are the result of cellular receptors that recognize superfibronectin that are distinct from the well-characterized integrins (22Morla A. Zhang Z. Rouslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Functional differences in the interaction of the tissue forms of fibronectin with microbial adhesins may also exist. In this study, we have characterized the interaction of S. pyogenes with a fibronectin matrix composed of superfibronectin (22Morla A. Zhang Z. Rouslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) or the fibronectin fibrils produced by CHO cell lines that overexpress the α5ॆ1 integrin (21Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 25Watarai M. Funato S. Sasakawa C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We show thatS. pyogenes can bind more efficiently to superfibronectin than fibronectin. Furthermore, using defined S. pyogenesstrains that express specific domains of protein F as hybrids with an unrelated surface-exposed protein, we show that, in contrast to soluble fibronectin, optimal binding to a fibronectin matrix requires both the UR and RD2 domains of protein F. Escherichia coli strains SG13009(pREP4) (Qiagen Inc.) and MV1184 (Takara Shuzo) were used for expression of fusion proteins. S. pyogenes JRS145 was derived from JRS4 (26Scott J.R. Guenther P.C. Malone L.M. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1641-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) by insertional inactivation of the gene emm6.1, which encodes M type 6 protein (27Caparon M.G. Geist R.T. Perez-Casal J. Scott R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5693-5701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insertional inactivation of prtF in JRS145 generated in SAM2 (18Hanski E. Caparon M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6172-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). S. pyogenes strains SAM17, SAM19, and SAM25 are derivatives of SAM2 expressing M/F hybrid proteins (20Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavski I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,28Hanski E. Fogg G. Tovi A. Okada N. Burnsein I. Caparon M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 253: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). E. coli was grown in Luria broth (29Scott J.R. Virology. 1972; 62: 344-349Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) at 37 °C with agitation, and S. pyogenes was cultured in Todd-Hewitt medium (Difco) supplemented with 0.27 yeast extract (THY medium). JRS4 and strains derived from JRS4 express protein F during culture under oxygen-limited conditions through a signaling pathway that involves the transcriptional activator rofA (30Fogg G.C. Gibson C.M. Caparon M.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 11: 671-684Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, all fibronectin binding to these S. pyogenes strains following culture in liquid THY medium at 37 °C without agitation in sealed culture bottles occurs exclusively via protein F and does not involve the unrelated non-proteinaceous and oxygen-dependent ZOP adhesin (31Lee J.-Y. Caparon M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 413-421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When required, antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin at 50 ॖg/ml for E. coli; streptomycin at 1000 ॖg/ml for S. pyogenes; kanamycin at 500 ॖg/ml for S. pyogenes; and erythromycin at 1 ॖg/ml for S. pyogenes. The construction of plasmids for the expression of the fibronectin binding domains of protein F as fusions to an N-terminal affinity tag consisting of six histidine residues (His6) has been described elsewhere (19Sela S. Aviv A. Tovi A. Burstein I. Caparon M.G. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavski I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28Hanski E. Fogg G. Tovi A. Okada N. Burnsein I. Caparon M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 253: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These included pUR-4 (UR), pRD-2 (RD2), and pPTF54 (UR plus 5 repeats of RD2). The fusion proteins were purified from SG13009(pREP4), containing the appropriate plasmid, by affinity chromotography using a nickel-nitriloacetic acid resin and native conditions according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The purified proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2). Each preparation was 957 pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining of gels with Coomassie Blue. Superfibronectin was produced as described previously (22Morla A. Zhang Z. Rouslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ॖg/ml of purified human plasma fibronectin (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h with 1 ॖm of a purified fusion protein that consists of the C-terminal two-thirds of the first type III repeat of fibronectin (III1-C) and corresponds to amino acids 600 to 674 of the whole molecule (32Kornblihtt A.R. Umezawa K. Vibe-Pederson K. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The typical yield was 1 ॖg/ml superfibronectin as determined by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Morla A. Zhang Z. Rouslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Since a region from the eleventh type III repeat corresponding to amino acids 1532 to 1599 of the fibronectin molecule (III11) is similar in composition to III1-C, but does not promote the formation of superfibronectin (22Morla A. Zhang Z. Rouslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), a fusion protein containing III11was incubated with fibronectin in a similar manner to produce a nonpolymerized control. The construction of the His6-III1-C and -III11 fusion proteins is described elsewhere (22Morla A. Zhang Z. Rouslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and the fusion proteins were purified from E. coli MV1184 as outlined above. Superfibronectin, fibronectin, or the III1-C fragment at various concentrations was coated onto 96-well ELISA plates (Costar). Following a 24-h incubation at 37 °C, the wells were then blocked with 57 bovine serum albumin in PBS (pH 7.2). Streptococci from overnight cultures were resuspended in PBS (pH 7.2) to a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml, and a 100-ॖl aliquot of the bacterial suspension was added to each well. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, unbound bacteria were removed by washing the wells five times with PBS containing 0.057 Tween 20 (PBS/T). The amount of streptococci bound to each protein was determined by ELISA using a rabbit antiserum specific for the S. pyogenes cell wall carbohydrate (Difco) and an alkaline phosphate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antiserum (Sigma). In control experiments, the monoclonal antibody 3E1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) that recognizes C-terminal heparin binding domain of fibronectin (33Pierschbacher M.D. Hayman E.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1981; 26: 259-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) was used at similar molar concentrations as the III1-C fragment. For inhibition assays, superfibronectin at a concentration of 5 ॖg/ml was used to coat wells of 96-well ELISA plates. Purified protein containing various concentrations of either UR, RD2, or UR plus five RD2 repeats was then added to superfibronectin-coated wells for 1 h at room temperature. In some experiments, a partially purified full-length protein F prepared as the periplasmic fraction of anE. coli strain carrying the chimeric plasmid pPTF5 (18Hanski E. Caparon M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6172-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) was used as an inhibitor at a concentration of 1.22 mg/ml in place of the purified fusion proteins. Streptococcal adherence to the treated wells was then determined as described above. For direct binding assays, 100 ॖl of the purified fusion protein containing either UR, RD2, or UR plus five repeats of RD2 at 10 ॖg/ml was added to superfibronectin- or the III1-C-coated well at various concentrations and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing the wells three times with PBS/T, the amount of each purified protein bound to superfibronectin or to the III1-C fragment was measured by ELISA using a monoclonal RGS·His antibody (Qiagen Inc.) and an alkaline phosphate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antiserum (Sigma). The α5ॆ1 integrin overexpressing CHO cell lines, CHO-HFR4 and CHO-HFR5, produce an abundant fibronectin matrix composed of fibrils longer and thicker than CHO cells alone (21Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 25Watarai M. Funato S. Sasakawa C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 4 days before use in 24-well plates on glass coverslips in minimal essential medium supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum and 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 57 CO2 and 957 air. Adherence of S. pyogenes to these cells was evaluated by staining with crystal violet and light microscopy and was quantified by determination of the number of bacteria bound per cell. For each experiment, at least 50 cells from each of five randomly chosen microscope fields were evaluated, and the data represent the mean number of bacteria bound per cell obtained from three independent experiments. In some experiments, percentage of cultured cells that bound bacteria was determined as described elsewhere (34Okada N. Pentland A.P. Falk P. Caparon M.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Inhibition assays with a purified rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for human fibronectin (COSMO BIO Co. Ltd.) were performed by incubation of CHO-HFR5 cells with various concentrations of antibody for 1 h at 37 °C prior to addition of S. pyogenes cells. Purified rabbit IgG isolated from pooled normal serum (Sigma) was used as a control. Reduction in bacterial binding was estimated by enumeration of the number of adherent bacteria in two different microscopic fields in three independent inhibition experiments. For staining the fibronectin matrix, cells were cultured as described above, fixed with 27 paraformaldehyde, and stained by direct immunofluorescence using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-human fibronectin antiserum (Binding Site Ltd.). The stained matrix was examined under a confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with dual detectors and an argon-krypton laser (MRC-1000, Bio-Rad). In some infections, such as infection of a wound, many bacterial species including S. pyogenes may initially encounter a matrix form of fibronectin. To investigate the binding of S. pyogenes to a fibronectin matrix, we employed a form of fibronectin (superfibronectin) that resembles the tissue form of fibronectin (22Morla A. Zhang Z. Rouslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 23Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19183-19187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hocking D.C. Smith R.K. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Superfibronectin was produced by the incubation of fibronectin with a fragment corresponding to the C-terminal two-thirds of the III1 fibronectin repeat, which binds to fibronectin with high affinity and induces spontaneous disulfide cross-linking of the fibronectin dimers into matrix fibrils (22Morla A. Zhang Z. Rouslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 23Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19183-19187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hocking D.C. Smith R.K. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). Analysis of the binding of protein F-expressing S. pyogenes JRS145 revealed that binding to superfibronectin was much more efficient than to fibronectin (Fig. 2 B). Binding to 2.5 ॖg/ml superfibronectin was increased 7-fold relative to fibronectin at this concentration and was comparable with the degree of binding obtained with 10 ॖg/ml fibronectin. To circumvent a possibility that the increased binding of JRS145 to the superfibronectin might result from the fibronectin bound to immobilized III1-C, thereby protecting the fibronectin from denaturation on a plastic dish, fibronectin was coated onto 96-well plates with the monoclonal antibody 3E1, which binds to the C-terminal heparin binding domain of fibronectin (33Pierschbacher M.D. Hayman E.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1981; 26: 259-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and then binding of JRS145 was examined. As shown in Fig. 2 C, treatment of fibronectin with the monoclonal antibody 3E1 in place of the III1-C did not result in increased binding of JRS145 strain under the same conditions as that of Fig. 2 B. Binding to superfibronectin required protein F as demonstrated by the dramatically reduced binding of a protein F-deficient mutant SAM2 to superfibronectin under these conditions (Fig. 2 D). Minimal binding was observed to the immobilized III1-C fragment alone (Fig. 2 B), and control experiments indicated that total amount of fibronectin bound to wells did not differ between superfibronectin- and fibronectin-coated wells. In addition, the levels of binding observed were not influenced by any M protein-induced streptococcal aggregation since the gene that encodes M protein has been deleted from both JRS145 and SAM2. These data suggest that S. pyogenes binds much more efficiently to the fibrillar form of fibronectin via protein F than to immobilized plasma fibronectin. Previous studies have demonstrated that two domains of protein F, UR and RD2, are involved in the binding ofS. pyogenes to extracellular matrix (20Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavski I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To examine the binding of protein F to superfibronectin, purified proteins containing either UR, RD2, or UR plus five RD2 repeats were evaluated for their ability to compete with protein F-expressing S. pyogenes for binding to superfibronectin. A purified protein containing both fibronectin binding domains of protein F (UR plus five RD2 repeats) blocked over 907 of the streptococcal binding to superfibronectin at a final concentration of 1000 nm, whereas purified proteins containing either UR alone or RD2 alone blocked binding by only 707 and 507, respectively, under identical conditions (Fig. 3). The level of inhibition obtained with the complete protein F molecule was essentially the same as that by the purified protein containing both UR plus the five repeats of RD2 (data not shown). To examine the relative contributions of the UR and RD2 domains to the whole fibronectin binding domains of protein F, the binding ability of each of the purified proteins to superfibronectin was determined by the direct binding assay. The specific binding of the purified protein containing UR and five repeats of RD2 to 10 ॖg/ml superfibronectin was approximately 1.6- and 2.0-fold higher than that by the purified proteins containing UR and RD2, respectively (Fig. 4). In contrast, the binding to the same concentration of immobilized fibronectin was mainly required for the purified protein containing UR domain (Fig. 4). Only a minimal binding of these purified derivatives of protein F to the immobilized III1-C fragment was detected (Fig. 4). Thus, both UR and RD2 are required for efficient binding of protein F to superfibronectin.Figure 4Direct binding of the fibronectin binding domain of protein F to superfibronectin. Superfibronectin (closed circle), fibronectin (closed square), or the III1-C fragment alone (open square), at various concentrations indicated, was coated onto 96-well plates. 100 ॖl of purified protein containing either UR, RD2, or UR plus five repeats of RD2 at 10 ॖg/ml was incubated with each immobilized protein for 2 h at room temperature. Specific binding was measured by ELISA using the monoclonal RGS·His antibody and an alkaline phosphate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antiserum. Data represent the mean of duplicate samples, which differed by less than 57 from the mean value for each pair at all concentrations tested.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further characterization of the efficient binding to the matrix form of fibronectin utilized CHO cell lines that demonstrate a 3.1- (CHO-HFR4) and 7.4-fold (CHO-HFR5) overexpression of the human α5ॆ1 integrin (25Watarai M. Funato S. Sasakawa C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These integrin-overexpressing cells accumulate a more abundant fibronectin matrix than the parental CHO cells, which results in the organization of fibrillar network (21Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the levels of fibronectin fibrils produced from CHO-HFR4 and CHO-HFR5 cells correlate with the increased levels of α5ॆ1 integrin expressed. JRS145 adhered efficiently to CHO-HFR5 cells, with bacteria being largely clustered on defined areas of the cell surface (Fig. 5). For CHO-HFR4 cells, an intermediate amount of binding was seen, which appeared as small clusters of streptococci covering the surface of the cells (Fig. 5). The numbers of bacteria bound to CHO-HFR4 and CHO-HFR5 cells were 6.2- and 9.8-fold greater than to CHO cells. To see if S. pyogenes cells bound specifically to a fibronectin matrix produced from α5ॆ1 integrin-overexpressing CHO cells, a polyclonal antibody specific for human fibronectin was tested for its ability to inhibit bacterial binding to CHO-HFR5 cells. Following preincubation of CHO-HFR5 cells with either 0.1, 1, or 10 ॖg/ml of anti-human fibronectin antibody, a concentration-dependent inhibition of streptococcal adherence to CHO-HFR5 cells was observed (TableI). Approximately 707 of bacterial adherence was blocked by incubation of CHO-HFR5 cells with 10 ॖg/ml of antibody (Table I). In addition, protein F-deficient mutant SAM2 did not adhere to any CHO cell line at a detectable level. These findings demonstrate that an elevated deposition of a fibronectin and subsequent formation of a matrix on the surface of host cells promoted increased binding of S. pyogenes via protein F.Table IInhibition of S. pyogenes JRS145 adherence to CHO-HFR5 cells by anti-human fibronectin antibodyTreatmentConcentration7 Inhibition1-aData represent the mean value and standard error of the mean of triplicate determinants.ॖg/mlPurified rabbit IgG100 ± 2Anti-human fibronectin antibody0.16 ± 2149 ± 41071 ± 71-a Data represent the mean value and standard error of the mean of triplicate determinants. Open table in a new tab To determine which fibronectin binding domain of protein F was responsible for binding to a fibronectin matrix produced from CHO-HFR5 cells, purified proteins of either UR, RD2, or both UR and five repeats of RD2 were tested for their ability to block bacterial binding to CHO-HFR5 cells. A purified protein containing both domains (UR plus five repeats of RD2) at a final concentration of 100 nm blocked adherence of JRS145 to CHO-HFR5 cells by 887, whereas a purified protein containing either UR alone or RD2 alone blocked the binding by 667 and 347 of the control level, respectively (TableII), suggesting that both domains participate in the bacterial binding to a fibronectin matrix in vivo.Table IIInhibition of S. pyogenes JRS145 adherence to CHO-HFR5 cells by purified proteins containing the fibronectin binding domain of protein FTreatmentProtein concentration7 Inhibition2-aData represent the mean value and standard error of the mean of triplicate determinants.nmBovine serum albumin1000UR2-bThese proteins were purified as a fusion protein with N-terminal affinity tag consisting of His6 (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡).

The structure of the chimeric proteins expressed by various strains is shown in Fig. 6 A. Microscopic examination revealed that S. pyogenes strain SAM19 (UR plus five RD2 repeats) bound to the cells at a similar level to protein F-expressing JRS145, whereas SAM17 (five repeats of RD2) or SAM25 (UR plus a single RD2 repeat) demonstrated a reduced level of binding (Fig.6 B). SAM2, the protein F-deficient parent of these hybrid-expressing strains, did not bind at any significant level to CHO-HFR5 cells (Fig. 6 B). These results were confirmed by measurement of the number of CHO-HFR5 cells-bound streptococci, in which the number of bacteria bound per cell were counted. The average number of SAM17 and SAM25 bound per CHO-HFR5 cell was approximately 30 and 607 fewer, respectively, than that by SAM19 (TableIII). These data provide additional evidence that efficient binding to matrix fibronectin requires both the UR and RD2 domains of protein F.Table IIIAdherence of S. pyogenes strains which express an M protein-fibronectin binding domain of protein F hybrid protein to CHO-HFR5 cellsStrain7 of adherence3-aThe number of CHO-HFR5 cells with adherent streptococci of the indicated strain was determined by light microscopy.No. of bacteria bound per cell3-bThe number of adherent bacteria of the indicated strain per CHO-HFR5 cell was shown (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡 for details).JRS14593 ± 53-cData represent the mean and standard error of the mean of triplicate determinants.137 ± 83-cData represent the mean and standard error of the mean of triplicate determinants.SAM1756 ± 444 ± 3SAM1990 ± 5125 ± 10SAM2582 ± 580 ± 8SAM21 ± 37 ± 33-a The number of CHO-HFR5 cells with adherent streptococci of the indicated strain was determined by light microscopy.3-b The number of adherent bacteria of the indicated strain per CHO-HFR5 cell was shown (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡 for details).3-c Data represent the mean and standard error of the mean of triplicate determinants. Open table in a new tab Fibronectin exist in several forms, which can arise through alternative splicing of the fibronectin mRNA by posttranslational modifications including glycosylation and phosphorylation or by multimer formation produced by disulfide bond cross-linking (5Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 375-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). These variations have been shown to affect the binding properties of many different host proteins to fibronectin (5Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 375-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 22Morla A. Zhang Z. Rouslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and several lines of evidence from the present study suggest that the form of fibronectin can effect its interaction with protein F. These include: 1) that protein F-mediated binding of S. pyogenes to superfibronectin, an in vitro derived form of fibronectin similar to matrix fibronectin, is more efficient than to immobilized soluble fibronectin; 2) that increased protein F-mediated binding to host cells can be enhanced by increasing the ability of the cells to induce the formation of a fibronectin matrix; and 3) that while UR is the dominant protein F domain for binding to soluble fibronectin (20Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavski I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), efficient binding to a fibronectin matrix requires RD2 in addition to UR. Because of its heterogeneity, it is not surprising that a variety of microorganisms, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species, have evolved numerous unrelated adhesins that bind to different specific domains of the fibronectin molecule. For example, protein F recognizes the N-terminal fibrin binding domain of fibronectin via RD2, while UR binds to a larger N-terminal domain consisting of the fibrin binding domain and adjacent collagen binding domain (20Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavski I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The N-terminal fibrin binding domain and the C-terminal heparin binding domain of fibronectin interacts with both staphylococci and streptococci (3Patti J.M. Höök M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 20Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavski I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The collagen binding domain contains a region recognized by mycobacteria and Streptococcus agalactiae (35Peake P. Gooley A. Britton W.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4828-4834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,36Tamura G.S. Rubens C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas the fibronectin type III repeat domain is recognized by protein H of S. pyogenes (15Frick I.-M. Crossin K.L. Edelman G.M. Björck L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The numerous mechanisms that have evolved for promoting bacterial binding to fibronectin enable many organisms to adhere and colonize different niches in the host. In many instances, an infecting bacterium could encounter both a matrix form of fibronectin in addition to a soluble form of fibronectin. Although the molecular basis of binding is poorly understood, some bacterial fibronectin-binding proteins possess preferential recognition of a specific state of the fibronectin molecule. For example, the P-pilus of uropathogenic E. coli, an adhesin that binds to Galα1–4Gal-containing glycosphingolipids on epithelial cells, can bind efficiently to immobilized fibronectin but not to the soluble form (37Westerlund B. Kuunsela P. Vartio T. Van Die I. Korhonen T.K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similarly, the uncharacterized fibronectin-binding proteins ofStreptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus sanguis also seem to preferentially recognize immobilizedversus soluble fibronectin (38von der Flier M. Chhun N. Wizemann T.M. Min J. McCarthy J.B. Tuomanen E.I. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4317-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lowrance J.H. Hasty D.L. Simpson W.A. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2279-2285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The YadA outer membrane protein found in several Yersinia species can mediate binding to cartilage-derived human cellular fibronectin but fails to bind to human plasma fibronectin in a solid phase (40Schulze-Koops H. Burkhardt H. Heesemann J. Kirch T. Swoboda B. Bull C. Goodman S. Emmrich F. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2513-2519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Discrimination between different forms of fibronectin may be a consequence of the sensitivity of a bacterial adhesion to detect conformational changes in fibronectin induced by the constraints imposed by any particular state, like soluble, immobilized, multimeric, or dimeric structures. The enhanced binding of S. pyogenes to superfibronectinversus fibronectin may suggest that protein F is sensitive to a conformational difference between these structures. However, since both fibronectin binding domains of protein F are required for optimal binding, matrix formation may either allow protein F greater access to the receptor domains of fibronectin or may create a high receptor density. Further analysis of streptococcal binding to superfibronectin and to CHO cells overproducing the α5ॆ1integrin will be useful for elucidation of the molecular mechanism of enhanced binding to matrix fibronectin. It is unknown why protein F possess two distinct domains for binding to fibronectin. The genes that encode proteins of the protein F/SfbI family are widely distributed among diverse isolates of S. pyogenes (41Talay S.R. Valentin-Weigand P. Timmis K.N. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 42Natanson S. Sela S. Moses A.E. Musser J.M. Caparon M.G. Hanski E. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 171: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the UR and RD2 domains are highly conserved (41Talay S.R. Valentin-Weigand P. Timmis K.N. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 42Natanson S. Sela S. Moses A.E. Musser J.M. Caparon M.G. Hanski E. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 171: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), suggesting that these two different domains are critical for protein F function. In this study, we have shown in several assays that both UR and RD2 are required to obtain a level of binding to matrix fibronectin that is as efficient as that of the whole protein F molecule. Thus, the conservation of both UR and RD2 may result from a requirement for both domains to promote efficient binding to tissue forms of fibronectin. This suggests that an interaction between two distinct fibronectin binding domains and a fibronectin matrix plays an important role in the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections.

In the reduced form, V52C bound operator DNA with slightly increased affinity. Exposure to oxidizing conditions resulted in disulfide bond formation, and the oxidized protein bound operator DNA with ∼6-fold higher affinity than wild-type protein. Inducer binding for both oxidized and reduced forms of V52C was comparable to wild-type lac repressor. In the presence of inducer, the reduced protein exhibited wild-type, diminished DNA binding. In contrast, DNA binding for the oxidized form was unaffected by inducer, even at 1 mm. Thus, the formation of the designed disulfide between Cys52 side chains within each dimer renders the protein-operator complex unresponsive to sugar binding, presumably by disrupting the allosteric linkage between operator and inducer binding.

Key tolac operon regulation is the lac repressor (LacI), a homotetramer of 150 kDa that binds to a specific operator sequence within Escherichia coli DNA to negatively regulate transcription of the lac operon (2Miller J.H.

Each LacI monomer can be divided into distinct structural domains.

Of particular interest is how conformational shifts evoked by sugar binding are relayed from the inducer binding region to the distant DNA binding site, eventuating in release of operator DNA. The small hinge sequence that connects the N-terminal and core domains must be involved in this communication, since the x-ray crystallographic structure of the protein-operator complex reveals few direct contacts between these distinct domains (see Fig. 1) (10Lewis M.

Science. 1996; 271: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), a mutation was designed at Val52 within the hinge region to generate a protein in which a disulfide bond could be formed between the N-terminal domains (Fig. 1). Consequently, the spatial relationship between the two N-terminal binding domains that form an operator binding site would be fixed. Generation of the anticipated disulfide bond in the V52C mutant protein resulted in increased affinity for operator and loss of sugar responsiveness. Thus, introduction of a disulfide between the N-terminal domains in the hinge region interrupts allosteric communication between the ligand binding domains. Plasmid pJC1 (20Chen J. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13843-13850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains the complete LacI gene and was used as the mutagenesis vector. Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis were purchased from the Great American Gene Co. (Ramona, CA). The Chameleon double-stranded mutagenesis protocol from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) was followed using a selection oligonucleotide that converts the PstI site in pJC1 to an XhoI site. The mutagenesis oligonucleotide contained a 3-base pair change to alter the Val codon to a Cys codon. The oligonucleotides were used in >100-fold excess over the pJC1 concentration. The oligonucleotides were annealed to denatured plasmid DNA, and then extension and ligation were performed using T7 polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), T4 ligase, and single-stranded binding protein (Promega, Madison, WI). After inactivation of T4 ligase, an initial digestion withPstI was followed by transformation into XLmutS cells (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA purified from these cells using the Wizard preparation protocol (Promega) was digested with PstI and then transformed into DH5α cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). The plasmid DNA was then screened for the selection site (XhoI). Colonies that carried the selection site were sequenced using dideoxy sequencing (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

DNase was added, and the lysed cells were centrifuged followed by precipitation of the supernatant with 407 ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 0.05 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 57 glucose. The protein was loaded onto a phosphocellulose column equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted with a gradient from 0.12–0.3 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 57 glucose. Fractions containing LacI activity were collected, and the protein was found to be >907 pure by SDS-PAGE. 2The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DTT, dithiothreitol; IPTG, isopropyl-ॆ-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Throughout purification and isolation, the protein activity was detected by the [14C]IPTG assay as described by Bourgeois (32Bourgeois S. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 21: 491-500Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein was mixed with [14C]IPTG, and the protein was precipitated with 707 ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was resuspended, and bound sugar was released by protein denaturation and precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. The supernatant from this final precipitation was used for scintillation counting to determine the amount of bound sugar. Oxidizing or reducing conditions were produced by adding 50 mm glutathione in either the oxidized or reduced form (Sigma) to 0.5 mg/ml protein in the absence of DTT. Mixtures were incubated on ice for 30 min prior to use in assays. Formation of protein with mobility corresponding to dimer in response oxidizing conditions was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Operator binding was assayed as described previously (33O'Gorman R.B. Dunaway M. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10100-10106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed at room temperature in buffer containing 0.01 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.15 m KCl, 57 dimethyl sulfoxide, and 50 ॖg/ml bovine serum albumin. DTT was added to appropriate buffers to a final concentration of 20 mm. The 40-base pair lacoperator sequence was labeled with 32P using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and used at a final concentration of 1 × 10−13m. The protein concentration was varied from 1 × 10−14 to 5 × 10−9m. The assay was a variation of that described by Wong and Lohman (34Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), using a dot-blot apparatus. The nitrocellulose filter was dried, and the bound DNA was imaged on a bioimaging plate (Fugi, Tokyo, Japan). The plate was scanned on a Fugi Bioimaging System, and the amount of radiolabel was quantitated using the program MacBas (Fugi, Tokyo, Japan). All data were analyzed using Nonlin for the Iris (35Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 36Johnson M.L. Faunt L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) to fit the binding curves using nonlinear least-squares analysis to the binding equation, R =Y m × [P]/(K d + [P]), whereR is the fraction of operator in complex,Y m is the fractional retention of bound complexes on the filter at saturation, [P] is the protein concentration in tetramer, and K d is the apparent dissociation constant in tetramer concentration. Release of operator DNA was assessed using fixed protein (3.2 × 10−10m) and DNA (1.5 × 10−11m) concentrations and varying IPTG concentration over the range from 1 × 10−7 to 1 × 10−4m. Inducer binding was monitored by fluorescence using an SLM-Aminco 8100 spectrofluorometer as described previously (37Daly T.J. Olson J.S. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5468-5474Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in 0.01 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15m KCl at a protein monomer concentration of 1.5 × 10−7m. Data were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares analysis using Nonlin for the Iris (35Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 36Johnson M.L. Faunt L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) to fit to the binding equation R = Y m × [IPTG] n/( Kdn + [IPTG] n), where R is fractional saturation,Y m is a factor that allows the maximum value ofR to float, K d is the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, and n is the Hill coefficient. From careful analysis of the LacI and PurR crystallographic structures (10Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P. Science. 1996; 271: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 30Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), Val52 in LacI was identified as the only potential protein-protein contact between the two hinge helices in each dimer component (Fig. 1). Fortunately, the Val52 side chains could be rotated so that substituted Cys side chains did not overlap with other side chains, and the distance between the Cॆ atoms at position 52 in each polypeptide within a dimer unit was optimal for disulfide formation. Therefore, the codon for this position was altered to encode Cys using double-stranded mutagenesis. The entire sequence of the DNA encoding the protein was determined to ensure that the designed change was the only alteration present. The V52C protein was purified and found to form a dimer under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 2); the extent of dimer formation was >907. Under reducing conditions, the same sample co-migrated with the monomer of wild-type LacI. Thus, a disulfide bond that links two monomers is able to form uniquely in the V52C protein and can be reduced effectively. V52C protein was examined for ligand binding characteristics under both oxidizing and reducing conditions using glutathione as the redox agent. Buffers to maintain the reduced form contained 20 mm DTT. Reduced V52C exhibited slightly increased affinity for operator DNA compared with wild-type protein (Table I, Fig. 3), consistent with previous studies that indicate some substitutions in this position will generate 舠tight binding舡 behavior (23Kleina L.G. Miller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Markiewicz P. Kleina L.G. Cruz C. Ehret S. Miller J.H. J. Mol.

In contrast, the oxidized form of V52C, with the disulfide linkage between two subunits, exhibited 6-fold tighter binding to operator than wild-type protein (Table I, Fig. 3). Furthermore, the formation of the disulfide linkage abolished inducer response for V52C protein, with operator binding affinity in the presence of 10−3m IPTG comparable to that in the absence of inducer (Table I, Fig. 3). In contrast, reduced V52C was inducible by IPTG to a degree similar to the wild-type protein. Thus, the formation of a disulfide bond linking the two N-terminal domains within each dimer appears to interrupt the conformational transition that elicits induction.Table IBinding properties of reduced and oxidized V52CProteinK dOperator binding affinity1-aValues are derived from global fits to four independent experiments.

Open table in a new tab Binding parameters were measured as described under 舠Materials and Methods,舡 and the error values reported are confidence limits at 1 S.D. To determine whether the reduced V52C differed in IPTG response from the wild-type protein at differing inducer concentration, repressor-operator release in the presence of sugar was examined. The protein-operator DNA complex was formed under conditions expected to generate ∼807 saturation, and the complex was then exposed to varying concentrations of inducer. Wild-type LacI exhibited a transition with a midpoint near 3 × 10−6m IPTG, while the reduced form of V52C had a midpoint at a slightly higher IPTG concentration (data not shown). However, the disulfide form of the mutant protein was unresponsive to inducer even at high concentrations. Since operator binding for the oxidized V52C was unresponsive to IPTG, the inducer binding capacity of these proteins was explored to establish whether disulfide bond formation disrupted the capacity of the protein to bind sugar. IPTG binding was monitored by the influence of sugar binding on the fluorescence properties of the protein, and both forms of V52C were compared with the wild-type protein. At pH 7.4, all three proteins generated similar binding curves that yielded comparable binding affinities (Table I). Thus, both oxidized and reduced V52C maintain the ability to bind inducer effectively. The formation of the disulfide linkage involving Cys at position 52 results in a protein with enhanced DNA binding capacity and wild-type inducer binding properties, but without the ability to respond to inducer. The increased affinity observed for operator binding with the oxidized protein presumably derives, at least in part, from the decreased entropic cost in 舠fixing舡 the two N-terminal domains into the optimal orientation for operator binding. This entropic cost has been paid separately as part of the energy of forming the disulfide bond. The ability to disconnect inducer and operator binding in V52C is of utmost interest. Structural shifts that accompany inducer binding (10Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P. Science. 1996; 271: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) are not transmitted to the N-terminal domains when they are covalently linked by the disulfide bond. Apparently, the disulfide bond disrupts the allosteric communication completely and generates a protein that is unable to respond to inducer. Further examination of this mutant protein in its oxidized and reduced states may provide more detailed insight into the mechanism of allosteric communication required for induction to release the lac operator site.

https://openalex.org/W1965672579,"We investigated the usefulness of ribozymes in inhibiting the expression of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) gene. Two hammerhead ribozymes that were against HTLV-Irex (RR) and tax (TR) mRNA were synthesized. Both ribozymes were sequence-specific in the in vitro cleavage analysis of run-off transcripts fromtax/rex cDNA. Intracellular activities of the ribozymes were studied in HTLV-I tax cDNA-transfected rat embryonic fibroblasts (Rat/Tax cells), which expressed the Tax but not Rex. Ribozymes were delivered into cells using anionic or cationic liposomes fused with hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ). Cellular uptake of ribozymes complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes was 15–20 times higher cellular uptake than naked ribozymes, and 4–5 times higher than that of ribozymes complexed with HVJ-anionic liposomes. HVJ-cationic liposomes promoted accumulation of ribozymes in cytoplasm and accelerated transport to the nucleus. Tax protein levels were decreased about 957 and were five times lower when the same amount of TR was introduced into the cells using HVJ-cationic, rather than HVJ-anionic liposomes. Inactive ribozyme and tax antisense oligodeoxynucleotides reduced Tax expression by about 207, whereas RR and tax sense oligodeoxynucleotides had no effect. These results suggest that the ribozymes' effect against taxmRNA was sequence-specific, and HVJ-cationic liposomes can be useful for intracellular introduction of ribozymes.

The discovery of RNA molecules with sequence-specific RNA-cleaving properties, called ribozymes, led to investigations of their potential use as specific inhibitors of gene expression (1Kruger K.

Several ribozyme configurations have been identified, of which the 舠hammerhead舡 (4Forster A.C. Symons R.H. Cell. 1987; 49: 211-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and 舠hairpin舡 (5Hampel A. Tritz R. Hicks M. Cruz P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) structures are the simplest, and most suitable, for biomedical applications (6Sarver N. Antisense Res. Dev. 1991; 1: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 7Kijima H. Ishida H. Ohkawa T. Kashani-Sabet M. Scanlon K.J. Pharmacol.

Several factors appear to contribute to the intracellular efficacy of ribozymes and thus the success of ribozyme gene therapy. Most importantly, the ribozyme must co-localize with its molecular target in the appropriate cellular compartment and must be present in a sufficiently high concentration to promote hybridization. Previous studies have generally assessed the catalytic activity of ribozymes in cell-free assay systems (6Sarver N. Antisense Res. Dev. 1991; 1: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 7Kijima H. Ishida H. Ohkawa T. Kashani-Sabet M. Scanlon K.J. Pharmacol.

The present study describes an experimental system that allows one to assess the effects of ribozymes in living cells. The in vivo application of ribozymes will depend on the availability of efficient delivery methods. The methods of gene transfer are classified as viral or non-viral. Ribozymes generally have been introduced into cells via a viral infection or the transfection of expression vectors (6Sarver N. Antisense Res. Dev. 1991; 1: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 9Xing Z. Whitton J.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1361-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wong-Staal F. Adv. Drug Deliver. Rev. 1995; 17: 363-368Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Viral vectors can potentially lead to the incorporation of ribozyme-encoding genes into the cellular chromosomes, thereby allowing their permanent expression, and many studies now are aimed at developing suitable vectors that present a minimal associated risk to the host. Alternatively, ribozymes can be delivered to the cells by non-viral methods, such as lipophilic vesicles (liposomes) and cholesterol (6Sarver N. Antisense Res. Dev. 1991; 1: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We recently developed a highly efficient method for gene transfer that involves the entrapment of DNA or RNA using hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ, 1The abbreviations used are: HVJ, hemagglutinating virus of Japan; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HTLV-I, human T-cell leukemia virus type I; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, propidium iodide; Rat/Tax cell, tax-expressing rat embryonic fibroblast; RR, ribozyme against HTLV-I rex mRNA; RC, inactive control ribozyme derived from RR; TR, ribozyme against HTLV-Itax mRNA; TC, inactive control ribozyme derived from TR; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; bp, base pair(s).

However, especially in cultured cells, the level of transgene expression achieved with this method is somewhat lower than that obtained with some of the viral vectors. We then improved this gene delivery system using cationic lipids for the liposomes (13Saeki Y. Matsumoto N. Nakano Y. Mori M. Awai K. Kaneda Y. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we compared the effects of ribozymes that had been transferred into living cells, using anionic or cationic liposomes. Ribozymes may become useful molecular therapies for several diseases of humans, including human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) infection, which is etiologically associated with adult T-cell leukemia (14Yoshida M. Miyoshi I. Hinuma Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2031-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar, 15Sodroski J. Rosen C. Goh W.C. Haseltine W. Science. 1985; 228: 1430-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The HTLV-I Tax protein has oncogenic properties that may play a key role in tumorigenesis (16Nerenberg M. Hinrichs S.H.

We previously evaluated gene therapy for the treatment of HTLV-I-related diseases usingtax antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) (18Kitajima I. Shinohara T. Minor T. Bibbs L. Bilakovics J.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 609-617PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we describe an approach involving ribozyme-mediated cleavage of HTLV-I tax/rex mRNA. We investigated whether ribozymes can cleave their target RNAs in the cells and whether HVJ-cationic liposome-mediated gene transfer allows efficient introduction of ribozymes into living cells. Ribozymes were chemically synthesized on a 1-ॖmol scale using a DNA synthesizer (model 8909 Expedite System, PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). We generated two hammerhead ribozymes that targeted the tax/rex mRNA based on previously published sequence information (21Seiki M. Hattori S. Hirayama Y. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3618-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). The ODNs were designed to bracket thetax and rex AUGs, which has been shown to inhibit HTLV-I Tax protein expression in experiments using antisense ODNs (18Kitajima I. Shinohara T. Minor T. Bibbs L. Bilakovics J. Nerenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25881-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kitajima I. Shinohara T. Bilakovics J. Brown D.A. Xu X. Nerenberg M.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 609-617PubMed Google Scholar). The ribozyme targeting the rex mRNA (RR) had the sequence 5′-GSGSGSCCUCCCUG*AUGAGGCCGAAAGGCCGAAACGGGUSCSUS-3′. It cleaves the mRNA at position 5139 of the HTLV-I genome. The ribozyme targeting tax mRNA (TR), which cleaves the mRNA at position 7308 of the HTLV-I genome, had the sequence 5′-ASCSCSCUGGGCUG*AUGAGGCCGAAAGGCCGAAAGUGGGSCSCS-3′ (Fig. 1 A). The HTLV-I-related sequences are underlined. As described previously by Ruffner et al. (22Ruffner D.E. Stormo G.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10695-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), we also designed inactive control ribozymes for RR (labeled RC) and TR (labeled TC), which inactivate the hammerhead motif by replacing G5with A (indicated by *). Each ribozyme contains phosphorothioate-modified nucleotides (indicated by 舠s舡). The 5′ end of each ribozyme was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) using the FluoroPrime reagent (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Total cellular RNA was isolated from the HTLV-I-infected T-cell line, MT-2 cells (gift of Prof. I. Miyoshi, Kochi Medical School) by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). HTLV-Itax cDNA from the MT-2 cells was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using HTLV-I tax/rex-specific primers as described previously (24Kitajima I. Yamamoto K. Sato K. Nakajima T. Maruyama I. Osame M. Nishioka K. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGEM-T was purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). The run-off transcription vector, pGEM-T-tax, was obtained by cloning the 220-bp HTLV-Itax cDNA (corresponding to HTLV-I bp 5095–7357, Fig.1 A) using the NcoI site in the multiple cloning region of pGEM-T. Run-off transcription was performed in the presence of 50 ng of pGEM-T-tax plasmid linearized withBamHI, pGEM-T-tax plasmid, 500 ॖmof each dNTP, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, digoxigenin-labeled dUTP, and T7 RNA polymerase. After incubation at 37 °C for 120 min, the reaction was terminated by adding stop solution (957 formamide and 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The cleavage kinetics of the ribozymes were determined using tax mRNA obtained by run-off transcription from pGEM-T-tax. The cleavage reactions contained 2 pmol/ml tax mRNA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0–25 mmMgCl2, and 0.2–20 pmol/ॖl ribozyme. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding 100 mm EDTA. The samples were heated for 5 min at 65 °C, placed immediately on ice, loaded onto a 107 polyacrylamide, 8m urea gel, and transferred to an Immobilon-S membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The cleavage products were detected using an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase and visualized using an enzyme-linked color reaction (Boehringer Mannheim Corp., Mannheim, Germany). HVJ-cationic liposomes were prepared as described elsewhere (12Kaneda Y. Iwai K. Uchida T. Science. 1989; 243: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 13Saeki Y. Matsumoto N. Nakano Y. Mori M. Awai K. Kaneda Y. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gao X. Huang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). In brief, a lipid mixture that contained 6 mg of phosphatidylcholine, 3 mg of cholesterol, and 0.75 mg of 3ॆ-[N-(N′,N-dimethylaminoethane)carbamoyl]cholesterol was dissolved in chloroform and evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The dried mixture was hydrated with 200 ॖl of balanced salt solution (137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6) containing 100 ॖg of ribozymes. Liposomes were prepared by vortex and extrusion. The liposomes were fused with HVJ that had been inactivated by ultraviolet light; the amount of virus used corresponded to 3 × 104 hemagglutinating units. The HVJ-liposome complexes were separated from unfused HVJ by ultracentrifugation through a 307 (w/w) sucrose layer at 62,800 × g for 90 min. Rat embryonic fibroblasts (Rat-1) transfected with the HTLV-Itax expression plasmid pH2R40M (Rat/Tax cells) have been described previously (17Tanaka A. Takahashi C. Yamaoka S. Nosaka T. Maki M. Hatanaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1071-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The pH2R40M plasmid contains the SV40 promoter and polyadenylation signal, an R fragment of the HTLV-I long terminal repeat, a neomycin resistance gene, and a HindIII fragment derived from pX, which encodes intact Tax protein. The pH2R40M plasmid expresses the HTLV-I Tax protein, but not the Rex protein. The plasmid (5 ॖg) was mixed with 10 ॖg of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and added to the Rat-1 cells. Transfected cells were selected in medium containing with 800 ॖg/ml G418 sulfate (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). The resultingtax-transfected Rat-1 cells (Rat/Tax cells) stably express the Tax protein. The Rat/Tax cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 ॖg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 57 CO2 atmosphere. To determine ribozyme uptake into the cells, 2 × 105 Rat/Tax cells were incubated with 1 ॖm naked FITC-labeled TR, 1 ॖm FITC-labeled TR complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes, or 1 ॖm FITC-labeled TR complexed with HVJ-anionic liposomes for 24 h. FITC-labeled-rabbit IgG (10 ॖg/ml) was used as a control. The cells were permeabilized with 707 ethanol for 30 min and incubated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 250 ॖg/ml propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells from each group were mounted and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica True Confocal Scanner 4D, Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The image consisted of 512 × 512 pixels with the FITC detection system. Cells containing FITC-labeled ribozymes were counted by flow cytometry using an EPICS Profile counter (Coulter Electronics Inc., Hialeah, FL). The cut-off value for positive staining by PI was set at 10 on the y axis, and the cut-off value for cells positive for TR was set at 10 on the x axis in the histogram. Rat/Tax cells (2 × 105) were incubated for 4 days without ribozymes or with 1 ॖmnaked TR, 1 ॖm TR complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes, 1 ॖm RR complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes, 1 ॖm TC complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes, 1 ॖm tax antisense ODNs complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes, or 1 ॖm tax sense ODNs complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes. Furthermore, cells were treated with 1 ॖm TR complexed with HVJ-cationic or -anionic liposomes diluted by a factor of 1 × 10−1 to 1 × 10−3. The cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.57 Nonidet P-40, 0.57 sodium deoxycholate, 0.17 SDS, 17 aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 98 °C. The proteins were fractionated on an 87 SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Nihon Millipore, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was blocked with 37 fat-free milk in PBS for 15 h at 4 °C and incubated for 1 h with anti-HTLV-I Tax monoclonal antibody (mAb) (gift of Prof. M. Hatanaka, Kyoto University) (diluted 1/1000). The membrane then was washed four times with PBS containing 0.17 Tween, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Cappel Research Products, Durham, NC) (diluted 1/10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). Rat/Tax cells (2 × 105) were incubated for 4 days without ribozymes, with 1 ॖm naked TR, 1 ॖm TR complexed with HVJ-anionic liposomes diluted by a factor of 1 × 10−2, or 1 ॖm TR complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes diluted by a factor of 1 × 10−2. The cells were permeabilized with 707 ethanol for 30 min. After incubation with saturating concentrations of anti-HTLV-I Tax mAb (1:500 dilution) for 30 min at 4 °C, the cells were treated with FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Cappel Research Products) as a second antibody. Control samples were treated with anti-FITC-labeled mouse IgG alone. The expression of Tax protein was quantified by flow cytometry (Coulter Electronics Inc). Rat/Tax cells (3 × 104) grown on glass coverslips for 4 days were treated with or without ribozymes as described above and fixed with 507 acetone, 507 methanol. Autofluorescence was quenched by treatment with 50 mm NH4Cl. The slides were rinsed in PBS containing 17 bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h in anti-HTLV-I Tax mAb (diluted 1:300). A tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated secondary antibody, goat IgG fraction to mouse IgG (Cappel Research Products), was added at a 1:200 dilution and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Negative control samples were similarly treated but were not exposed to the primary antibody. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica True Confocal Scanner 4D) was used to determine the intracellular localization of both the HTLV-I Tax protein and ribozymes. Each image consisted of 1024 × 1024 pixels with the two-color scanning analysis system. We synthesized two hammerhead ribozymes that were sequence-specific for a site downstream of the AUG start codons of the HTLV-I tax mRNA (TR) or rex mRNA (RR) (Fig. 1 A). These sites had previously been targeted successfully by antisense ODNs (18Kitajima I. Shinohara T. Minor T. Bibbs L. Bilakovics J. Nerenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25881-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kitajima I. Kawahara K. Hahyu N. Shin H. Tokioka T. Soejima Y. Tstutsui J. Ozawa M. Shimayama T. Maruyama I. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 609-617PubMed Google Scholar) and thus were expected to be accessible for ribozyme-mediated cleavage. Incubation of the 220-base substrate HTLV-I tax/rex mRNA with RR resulted in the predicted 97-base and 123-base cleavage products, whereas 148-base and 72-base cleavage products were observed following incubation with TR (Fig. 1 B). Both cleavage reactions were dose-dependent and were also dependent on the Mg2+ concentrations (Fig. 1 C). No cleavage products were observed when the mRNA was incubated with the inactive control ribozymes, RC and TC (Fig. 1 B). We previously established a novel and highly efficient method for gene transfer using HVJ-liposomes (11Kaneda Y. Uchida T. Kim J. Ishiura M. Okada Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 56-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Kaneda Y. Iwai K. Uchida T. Science. 1989; 243: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Gene delivery was even most efficient if the liposomes consisted of cationic rather than non-cationic lipids (13Saeki Y. Matsumoto N. Nakano Y. Mori M. Awai K. Kaneda Y. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have compared the gene transfer efficiency of ribozymes in the absence of HVJ-liposomes (naked ribozymes) and in the presence of HVJ-cationic or -anionic liposomes. To evaluate the intracellular distribution of the ribozymes, FITC-labeled ribozymes were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cells of control samples containing FITC-conjugated rabbit IgG exhibited no staining (Fig.2 A). Incubation of Rat/Tax cells with naked ribozymes for 24 h resulted in weak staining and spotty distribution of ribozymes in the cytoplasm of 1–37 of the cells (Fig. 2 B). Examination of the cells at a higher magnification demonstrated that the naked ribozymes were distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. TR complexed with HVJ-anionic liposomes showed a significantly improved cellular uptake compared with the naked ribozymes (Fig. 2 C). Most of these ribozymes were retained in the cytoplasm and existed as vesicles in the endosomes or lysosomes (data not shown). Approximately 207 of cells also exhibited staining in their nuclei. In contrast, more than 907 of the Rat/Tax cells incubated with TR in the presence of HVJ-cationic liposomes exhibited cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence, which was more intense than in cells treated with anionic liposomes (Fig. 2 D). To quantitate the cellular uptake of TR complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes, cells containing FITC-labeled ribozymes were counted by flow cytometry. Positive staining was indicated by a signal shift to the right on the x axis, compared with that of a negative control sample stained with mouse IgG (Fig.3, left panels). Rat/Tax cells positive for nuclear staining by PI were located above the cut-off value of 10 on the y axis (Fig. 3, right panels,regions a and b). Cells containing FITC-labeled ribozymes were located to the right of the cut-off value of 10 on thex axis (regions b and d). Region b of the histogram represented double-positive cells, whose proportion we estimated. These analyses indicated that naked TR was present in 57 of the 104 cells after a 24-h incubation (Fig. 3 A), whereas ribozymes complexed with HVJ-anionic liposomes had been taken up into 22.87 of the cells (Fig.3 B). In contrast, ribozymes complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes demonstrated a significantly increased uptake and were delivered into 96.17 of the cells (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the uptake of ribozymes complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes was 15–20 times increased compared with naked ribozymes and 4–5 times increased compared with ribozymes complexed with HVJ-anionic liposomes. Rat/Tax cells express high levels of taxmRNA, but no rex mRNA, because the taxcDNA used transfected these cells contained naked 5′-rexsequences (17Tanaka A. Takahashi C. Yamaoka S. Nosaka T. Maki M. Hatanaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1071-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). Thus, the tax mRNA from Rat/Tax cells could be cleaved by TR but not by RR. We used Western blot analysis to investigate whether the ribozymes introduced into the cells by HVJ-cationic liposome-mediated gene transfer possessed sequence-specific catalytic activity and therefore down-regulated Tax expression. The Tax protein signals were quantified by densitometric scanning. The 40-kDa Tax protein was highly detectable in Rat/Tax cells treated with 1 ॖm naked TR (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). Treatment with 1 ॖm TR complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes significantly reduced Tax expression by approximately 957, compared with cells treated with 1 ॖm naked TR (Fig.4 B, lane 2). In contrast, Tax protein expression was not affected by treatment with 1 ॖm RR complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). A reduction of nearly 207 in Tax protein expression was observed in cells treated with 1 ॖm TC complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). However, this effect of TC may be due to an antisense effect of the flanking TR sequences. Consistent with this hypothesis, a similar reduction in Tax expression of about 207 was also found in cells treated with 1 ॖm tax antisense ODNs (18Kitajima I. Shinohara T. Minor T. Bibbs L. Bilakovics J. Nerenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25881-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kitajima I. Kawahara K. Hahyu N. Shin H. Tokioka T. Soejima Y. Tstutsui J. Ozawa M. Shimayama T. Maruyama I. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 609-617PubMed Google Scholar) complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes (Fig. 4 B, lane 5). In contrast, Tax expression was not reduced after treatment with 1 ॖm tax sense ODNs, complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes (Fig.4 B, lane 6). We compared the degree of down-regulation of Tax expression obtained when cationic or anionic liposomes that carried equal amounts of TR were used. Under these conditions, TR complexed with HVJ-cationic or HVJ-anionic liposomes produced a similar level of Tax down-regulation (data not shown). To evaluate the ribozyme achieved with each type of HVJ-liposome more precisely, we also compared Tax suppression after ribozyme transfer using diluted HVJ-liposomes. When the Rat/Tax cells treated with 1 ॖm TR complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes diluted by a factor of 1 × 10−2, a reduction of Tax expression occurred (Fig.5, lanes 2–4). In contrast, 1 ॖm TR complexed with HVJ-anionic liposomes diluted by a factor of 1 × 10−1 showed a decrease in Tax protein expression (Fig. 5, lanes 5–7). Densitometric scanning analysis of a Tax immunoblot demonstrated that Tax signals were approximately 5 times lower in cells incubated with 1 ॖmTR complexed with 1 × 10−2 diluted HVJ-cationic liposomes (Fig. 5, lane 3), compared with equally diluted HVJ-anionic liposomes (Fig. 5, lane 6). We quantified the inhibitory effects of TR on Tax expression by flow cytometry using an anti-Tax mAb as reported previously (20Kitajima I. Kawahara K. Hahyu N. Shin H. Tokioka T. Soejima Y. Tstutsui J. Ozawa M. Shimayama T. Maruyama I. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 609-617PubMed Google Scholar). Rat/Tax cells expressed Tax protein at a high level (Fig.6 A). In cells treated with 1 ॖm naked TR, the level of Tax expression was almost unaffected (Fig. 6 B). Incubation of the cells with 1 ॖm TR complexed with HVJ-anionic liposomes diluted by a factor of 1 × 10−2 (Fig. 6 C), however, considerably down-regulated Tax expression, although to a lesser extent than did 1 ॖm TR complexed with an equal volume of HVJ-cationic liposomes (Fig. 6 D). The intracellular distribution and kinetics of ribozyme activity in the Rat/Tax cells was visualized using FITC-labeled ribozymes. The relationship between the ribozymes and Tax protein was investigated by a two-color confocal laser-fluorescence-microscopy scanning system using FITC-labeled ribozyme, which produces a green signal, and TRITC-labeled Tax protein, visible as an orange signal. A yellow signal indicated the co-localization of ribozyme and Tax protein. All untreated Rat/Tax cells expressed Tax protein both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, and the expression level did not differ among individual cells (data not shown). When the cells were incubated with TR complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes for 4 days, Tax protein expression decreased markedly, resulting in the degradation of Tax protein, as indicated by the loss of orange signals (Fig.7 A). Approximately 57 of the cells did not incorporate TR and still expressed Tax protein (Fig. 7A, arrow). In contrast, following the introduction of RR mediated by HVJ-cationic liposomes, yellow signals were clearly evident in the cytoplasm and nuclei of the Rat/Tax cells (Fig. 7 B). This observation suggests that Tax protein was still highly expressed following the nuclear deposition of RR. The present study evaluated the efficiency of a method of gene transfer using anionic or cationic liposomes complexed with HVJ to introduce hammerhead ribozymes targeted against HTLV-Itax/rex mRNA into living cells. We also investigated the sequence specificity and activity of these ribozymes in the cells. We found that transfer efficiency was higher for ribozymes complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes rather than with HVJ-anionic liposomes. The ribozymes specifically cleaved the HTLV-I tax/rex target mRNA, and TR suppressed Tax protein expression in the cells. The ultimate goal of gene therapy for HTLV-I infections is the inactivation of viral genes in the infected cells. Tax protein has been suggested to play a role in tumorigenesis by modulating the expression of cellular genes (26Yoshida M. Roman G.C. Vernant J.-C. Osame M. HTLV-I and the Nervous System. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989: 19-29Google Scholar). We previously reported t"
https://openalex.org/W1988929639,"Rat liver cytosolic glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) catalyzes the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation of glycine to sarcosine. It is comprised of four identical 292-amino acid residue subunits. Recently, evidence has been provided to show that GNMT is identical to the cytosolic receptor for benzo[a]pyrene, which induces cytochrome P450 1A1 gene expression. In the present study we show that chemical modification of purified rat liver GNMT with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) resulted in dissociation of the tetrameric enzyme and was accompanied by loss of enzyme activity. Amino acid sequence analysis of the FITC-labeled peptides obtained by hydrolysis of the modified protein with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease revealed that lysines 45, 89, 92, 96, 122, and 147 were modified. Lys-122 and Lys-147 were derivatized in tetrameric, dimeric, and monomeric forms of the enzyme. Lysines 45, 89, 92, and 96 were derivatized only in monomeric GNMT, suggesting that modification of these residues resulted in GNMT dissociation. The modified monomeric GNMT was quickly transported into isolated rat liver nuclei. This transport was specific for the GNMT monomer, since neither tetramer nor dimer was able to enter the nuclei. Bovine carbonic anhydrase, similar in size to the GNMT monomer, was labeled with FITC to a similar extent but was not transported into the nuclei. Disruption of the nuclei containing fluorescein-labeled GNMT and subsequent extraction of the nuclear lysate with both high and low salt buffers recovered FITC-GNMT only in the chromatin pellet. Our study supports the suggestion of an additional function for GNMT, probably connected with regulation of cytochrome P450 1A1 gene expression."

Chromosomal replicases are composed of several subunits in all organisms (1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 165-194Google Scholar). In keeping with the need to replicate long chromosomes, these multicomponent replicases are rapid and highly processive. Cellular chromosomal replicases derive their processivity from a protein subunit that is shaped like a ring and completely encircles DNA (2Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. J. Mol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sliding clamp does not assemble onto DNA by itself but requires a complex of several proteins, called a 舠clamp loader,舡 that couples ATP hydrolysis to the assembly of sliding clamps onto DNA (5O'Donnell M.

With the aim to crystalize larger complexes, we have started to isolate the genes encoding the replicase subunits from a thermophile as heat stabile proteins are often more amenable to crystal structure analysis. As a beginning to identify and characterize the replicase of a thermophile, we started by looking for a homolog to the E. coli dnaX gene that encodes two protein subunits (γ and τ) of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme through an efficient translational frameshifting mechanism (11Tsuchihashi Z. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2516-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 12Flower A.M. McHenry C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The dnaX gene has another homolog, holB, which encodes yet another subunit (δ′) of the holoenzyme (14Carter J.R. Franden M.A. Aebersold R. McHenry C.S. J.

Indeed, we identified a T. thermophilis homolog of dnaX. The gene encodes a full-length protein of 529 amino acids. The N-terminal third of the sequence shares over 507 identity to dnaX genes as divergent as E. coli (Gram-negative) and Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive). The T. thermophilis dnaXhomolog contains a DNA sequence that provides a translational frameshift signal for production of two proteins from the same gene. Such frameshifting within dnaX has previously only been documented in E. coli. The two protein subunits produced from the E. coli dnaX gene form the central core of the replicase, and they organize its three components into a holoenzyme particle (20Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The τ subunit dimer holds two core polymerases together (21McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2657-2663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it also forms a mixed heterotetramer (τ2γ2) upon association with the γ subunit of the clamp loader, thereby bringing one clamp loading assembly (γ complex) into the large holoenzyme (18 polypeptides, 830 kDa) (20Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This organized holoenzyme assembly acts at a replication fork to simultaneously replicate both strands of duplex DNA in a highly coordinated fashion (23Maki H. Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6570-6578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Hughes A.J. Franden M.A. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The γ protein is encoded by the same gene that encodes the τ protein (dnaX). γ is essentially the N-terminal 2/3 of τ; it becomes truncated by a translational frameshift that adds one unique residue before encountering a stop codon in the −1 reading frame (11Tsuchihashi Z. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2516-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 12Flower A.M. McHenry C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This frameshift is highly efficient and occurs approximately 507 of the time. Organisms other than E. coli lack the equivalent of the τ 舠glue舡 function, and the three components (DNA polymerase, clamp, and clamp loader) appear to behave as independent units. For example, in eukaryotes from yeast to humans and in bacteriophage T4, the three replicase components do not form a holoenzyme in solution and purify independent of each other (for review, see Ref. 3Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Further, frameshifting has not been observed in these dnaX homologs, nor is a frameshift site like that in E. coli dnaX contained in the dnaX homolog of the Gram-positive B. subtilis. Hence, the presence of both τ- and γ-like proteins in T. thermophilis suggests that its replicase may be organized into a mutiprotein particle similar to the E. coliDNA polymerase III holoenzyme.

T. thermophilis (strain HB8) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Genomic DNA was prepared from cells grown in 0.1 liter of Thermus medium N697 (4 g of yeast extract, 8.0 g of polypeptone (BBL 11910), 2.0 g of NaCl, 30.0 g of agar, 1.0 liter of distilled water) at 75 °C overnight. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.05 m EDTA, 2 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Then 25 ml of 0.10 m EDTA (pH 8.0), 67 SDS was added and mixed, followed by 60 ml of phenol. The mixture was shaken for 40 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at room temperature. The upper phase (50 ml) was removed and mixed with 50 ml of phenol:chloroform (50:50 v/v) for 30 min, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at room temperature. The upper phase was decanted, and the DNA was precipitated upon addition of 1/10th volume of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 6.5) and 1 volume of ethanol. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed twice with 2 ml of 807 ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 1 ml of Tris-EDTA buffer. DNA oligonucleotides for amplification ofT. thermophilis genomic DNA were as follows. The upstream 32-mer, 5′-CGCAAGCTTCACGCSTACCTSTTCTCCGGSAC-3′ (S indicates a mixture of G and C), consists of aHindIII site within the first 9 nucleotides (underlined), followed by codons encoding the following sequence (HAYLFSGT). The downstream 34-mer, 5′-CGCGAATTCGTGCTCSGGSGGCTCCTCSAGSGTC-3′, consists of anEcoRI site (underlined), followed by codons encoding the sequence KTLEEPPEH on the complementary strand. The amplification reactions contained 10 ng of T. thermophilis genomic DNA, 0.5 ॖm each primer, in a volume of 100 ॖl of Vent polymerase reaction mixture according to the instructions of the manufacturer (10 ॖl of ThermoPol buffer, 0.5 mm each dNTP, and 0.5 mm MgSO4). Amplification was performed using the following cycling scheme: 5 cycles of 30 s at 95.5 °C, 30 s at 40 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; 5 cycles of 30 s at 95.5 °C, 30 s at 45 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; and 30 cycles of 30 s at 95.5 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Products were visualized in a 1.57 native agarose gel. Genomic DNA was digested with either XhoI, XbaI,StuI, PstI, NcoI, MluI,KpnI, HindIII, EcoRI, EagI,BglI, or BamHI, followed by Southern analysis in a native agarose gel (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 76-85Google Scholar). The filter was probed with the PCR 2The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s); X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl ॆ-d-galactopyranoside; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside; TBS-T, Tris-buffered saline with Tween; TLC, thin layer chromatography. product radiolabeled by random priming. The XbaI digest showed a single 4-kb fragment. A genomic plasmid library containing XbaI inserts was prepared upon digesting 1 ॖg of genomic T. thermophilis DNA with 10 units of XbaI in 100 ॖl of NEBuffer N2 (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol) for 2 h at 37 °C. The Alter-1 vector (0.5 ॖg) (Promega) was digested with 1 unit of XbaI in NEBuffer N2. After purification of the XbaI digests by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the genomic digest was incubated with 0.05 ॖg of digested Alter-1 and 20 units of T4 ligase in 30 ॖl of ligase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP) at 15 °C for 12 h. The ligation reaction was transformed into the DH5α strain of E. coli, and transformants were plated on LB plates containing ampicillin and screened for the dnaX insert using the radiolabeled PCR probe. Plasmid DNA was prepared from 20 positive colonies, and of these, 6 contained the expected 4-kb insert when digested withXbaI. Sequencing of the insert was performed by the Sanger method using the Vent polymerase sequencing kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs Inc.). Frameshifting was analyzed by inserting a PCR fragment containing the dnaX frameshift site into lacZ in the three different reading frames, followed by plating on X-gal and scoring for blue or white colony formation (27Weiss R.B. Dunn D.M. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A brief description of the procedure follows. The frameshifting region within the T. thermophilis dnaX homolog was subcloned into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of pUC19. These sites are in the polylinker within the ॆ-galactosidase gene. Three constructs were produced such that the insert was in-frame with the downstream coding sequence of ॆ-galactosidase or out-of-frame (either −1 or −2). An additional three constructs were designed by mutating the frameshift sequence and then placing this insert into the three reading frames of the ॆ-galactosidase gene as described above. Production of the PCR inserts containing the frameshift site were constructed as follows. The upstream primer contained the heptamer site (5′-gcg cgg atc cgg agg gag aaa aaa aaa gcc tca gcc ca-3′). TheBamHI site for cloning into pUC is underlined. Also, the 舠g舡 of the −1 stop codon (tga) is replaced with a 舠c舡 (also underlined). The upstream primer for the mutant frameshift site was: 5′-gcg cgg atc cgg agg gag aga aga aaa gcc tca gcc ca-3′. The mutant sequence contains two substitutions of 舠g舡 for an 舠a舡 residue in the frameshift site (bold). Three downstream primers were utilized with each upstream primer to create two sets of three inserts in the 0, −1, and −2 frames. The sequence of these primers and the length of insert (after cutting with EcoRI and BamHI and inserting into pUC19) are as follows: 5′-gaa tta aat tcg cgc ttc ggg agg tgg g-3′, 0 frameshift, total 58 nucleotide insert; 5′-gcg cga att cgc gct tcg gga ggt ggg-3′, −1 frame, 54-mer insert; and 5′-gcg cga att cgg gcg ctt cag gag gtg gg-3′, −2 frame, 56-mer insert. The downstream primers have an EcoRI site (underlined); the EcoRI site of the 0 frame insert was blunt ended to produce the greater length insert (converting theEcoRI site to an aattaatt sequence). Also, the tca sequence, which produces the −1 frame tga stop codon was mutated to tcg in the −1 downstream primer so that read through would be allowed after the frameshift occurred. The six plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain DH5α and plated onto LB plates containing ampicillin and X-gal. The appearance of blue color was scored after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. The T. thermophilis dnaX homolog was cloned into the pET16 expression vector in two steps. First, the bulk of the gene was cloned into pET16 by removing thePmlI/XbaI fragment from pAlterdnaX, and placing it into SmaI/XbaI-digested Puc19 to yield Puc19ΔdnaX. The N-terminal sequence of the T. thermophilis dnaX homolog was then reconstructed to position anNdeI site at the N terminus. This was performed by amplifying the 5′ region encoding the N-terminal section of the γ/τ-like proteins using an upstream primer containing anNdeI site that hybridizes to the dnaX homolog at the start codon. The primer sequence for this 5′ end was 5′-gtggtgcatatg gtg agc gcc ctc tac cgc c-3′ (where theNdeI site is underlined and the coding sequence ofdnaX follows). The downstream primer hybridizes past thePmlI site at nucleotide positions 987–1004 downstream of the start codon (primer sequence: 5′-gtggtggtcgac cca gga ggg cca cct cca g-3′, where the initial 12 nucleotides contain aSalGI restriction site (underlined), followed by the sequence from the region downstream of the stop codon). The 1.1-kb nucleotide PCR product was digested withPmlI/NdeI, and thePmlI/NdeI fragment was ligated intoNdeI/PmlI-digested Puc19ΔdnaX to form Puc19dnaX. The Puc19dnaX plasmid was then digested with NdeI and SalI, and the 1.9-kb fragment containing the dnaX homolog was purified using the Sephaglas BandPrep Kit (Pharmacia-LKB). pET16b was digested withNdeI and XhoI. Then the full-lengthdnaX homolog was ligated into the digested pET16b to form pET16dnaX. Six liters of BL21(DE3)pLysSpETdnaX cells were grown in LB media containing 50 ॖg/ml ampicillin and 25 ॖg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C to an A 600 = 0.8, and then IPTG was added to a concentration of 2 mm. After a further 2 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −70 °C. The following steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells (15 g, wet weight) were thawed and resuspended in 45 ml of 1 × binding buffer (5 mm imidizole, 0.5m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (final pH 7.5)) using a Dounce homogenizer to complete cell lysis, and then 450 ॖl of 57 Polymin P (Sigma) was added. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 30 min in a Sorvall SS24 rotor at 4 °C. The supernatant (Fraction I, 40 ml, 376 mg of protein) was applied to a 5-ml HiTrap chelating Sepharose column (Pharmacia-LKB). The column was washed with 25 ml of binding buffer, then with 30 ml of binding buffer containing 60 mm imidazole, and then eluted with 30 ml of 0.5 m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5). Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed on an 87 Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Fractions containing subunits migrating at the T. thermophilis γ- and τ-like positions, and exhibiting cross reactivity with antibody to E. coli γ and τ in a Western analysis, were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 107 glycerol) containing 0.5 m NaCl (Fraction II, 36 mg in 7 ml). Fraction II was diluted 2-fold with buffer A and passed through a 2-ml ATP-agarose column equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl to remove any E. coli γ complex contaminant. Then 0.18 mg (300 ॖl) of Fraction II was gel filtered on a 24-ml Superose 12 column (Pharmacia-LKB) in buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. After the first 216 drops, fractions of 200 ॖl were collected (Fraction III) and analyzed by Western analysis, by ATPase assays, and by Coomassie Blue staining of an 87 SDS-polyacrylamide gel. E. coliγ protein was prepared as described (22Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pure γ protein (100 ॖg) was brought up in Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into a New Zealand Rabbit (Poccono Rabbit Farms). After 2 weeks, a booster consisting of 50 ॖg γ in Freund's adjuvant was administered, followed after 2 weeks by a third injection (50 ॖg). Western analysis of samples were performed in duplicate 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gels. One gel was Coomassie stained to evaluate the pattern of proteins present, and the other gel was then electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). For molecular size markers, the kaleidoscope markers (Bio-Rad) were used to visually verify that transfer of proteins onto the membrane had occurred. Membranes were blocked using 57 non-fat milk, washed with 0.057 Tween in Tris-buffered saline (TBS-T) and then incubated for over 1 h with a 1:5000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against E. coli γ and τ in 17 gelatin in TBS-T at room temperature. Membranes were washed using TBS-T buffer, and then antibody was detected on x-ray film (Kodak) using the ECL kit from Amersham Corp. The samples included: 1) a mixture of E. coliγ (15 ng) and τ (15 ng) subunits; 2) T. thermophiliswhole cells (100 ॖl) suspended in cracking buffer; and 3) purifiedT. thermophilis γ and τ fraction II (0.6 ॖg as a mixture). ATPase assays were performed in 20 ॖl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 8 mm MgCl2containing 0.72 ॖg of M13mp18 single-stranded DNA (where indicated), 100 ॖm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 2000–4000 cpm/pmol), and the indicated protein. Some reactions contained additional NaCl where indicated. Reactions were incubated at the temperatures indicated in the legend to Fig. 11 for 30 min and then were quenched with an equal volume of 25 mm EDTA. The aliquots were analyzed by spotting them (1 ॖl each) onto thin layer chromatography (TLC) sheets coated with Cel-300 polyethyleneimine (Brinkmann Instruments Co.). TLC sheets were developed in 0.5m lithium chloride, 1 m formic acid. An autoradiogram of the TLC chromatogram was used to visualize Pi at the solvent front and ATP near the origin, which were then cut from the TLC sheet and quantitated by liquid scintillation. The extent of ATP hydrolyzed was used to calculate the mol of Pi released/mol of protein/min. One mol of E. coli τ was calculated assuming a mass of 71 kDa/monomer. TheT. thermophilis γ/τ-like protein preparation was treated as an equal mixture, and thus 1 mol of protein as monomer was the average of the predicted masses of the γ- and τ-like proteins (54 kDa). ThednaX genes of the Gram-negative E. coli and the Gram-positive B. subtilis share more than 567 identity in amino acid sequence within the N-terminal 180 residues containing the ATP-binding domain (Fig. 1). Two highly conserved regions (shown in bold in Fig. 1) were used to design oligonucleotide primers for application of the polymerase chain reaction to T. thermophilis genomic DNA. Use of these primers with genomic T. thermophilis DNA resulted in a product of the expected size (345 nucleotide base pairs). The PCR product was radiolabeled and used to probe genomic DNA in a Southern analysis (Fig. 2). The Southern analysis showed a single XbaI fragment of approximately 4 kb, more than sufficient length to encode the dnaX homolog. AnXbaI digest of genomic DNA was ligated intoXbaI-digested Alter-1 vector. Ligated DNA was transformed into DH5 α cells, and colonies were screened with the labeled PCR probe. The sequence of the dnaX homolog contained within the insert is shown in Fig. 3.Figure 2Southern analysis of T. thermophilis genomic DNA. T. thermophilis genomic DNA was digested with restriction nucleases and Southern analyzed on a native agarose gel for presence of a dnaX homolog using the radiolabeled PCR probe. Enzymes used for digestion are shown above eachlane.

The DNA sequence (uppercase) and predicted amino acid sequence (lowercase) of the T. thermophilis dnaX homolog yields a 529-amino acid protein (τ-like protein) of 58.0 kDa. A putative frameshifting sequence containing several A residues 1478–1486 (underlined) results in a smaller protein (γ-like protein) of 49.8 kDa. The potential Shine-Dalgarno (S. D.) signal isbold and underlined. The start codon isbold, and the stop codon for the τ-like protein is marked by an asterisk. The potential stop codon for the γ-like protein is shown in bold after the frameshift site, and two potential Shine-Dalgarno sequences upstream of the frameshift site are indicated. The ATP binding site is indicated, and theasterisks above the four Cys residues near the ATP site indicate the putative Zn2+ finger. The proline-rich area is indicated above the sequence.

There are two possible in-frame candidate GTG codons. The first is 30 residues upstream of the second start site shown in Fig. 3 (this site is present in the Fig. 3 sequence upstream of the start site of the translated protein sequence of Fig. 3). The N-terminal region of τ/γ is homologous in several bacteria, both Gram-positive and -negative (Fig. 4). Use of the first start site would lead to a product having extra residues attached to its N terminus compared with the other dnaX homologs. The second start site, shown in Fig. 3, would produce a protein with a similar N-terminal sequence to the dnaX products of other bacteria. Indeed, as explained later, expression of the protein from the second GTG codon yields a protein having biochemical properties expected of products of dnaX. Nonetheless, it is still possible that the upstream codon is used. We are attempting to purify the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme from T. thermophilis for N-terminal analysis of the τ protein to resolve this ambiguity. Assuming that the T. thermophilis dnaX homolog starts with the second GTG codon, as shown in Fig. 3, the resulting protein consists of 529 amino acids (58.0 kDa), as compared with the full-length B. subtilis (62.7 kDa mass) (28Alonso J.C. Shirahige K. Ogasawara N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6771-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and E. coli (71.1 kDa) (29Yin K.-C. Blinkowa A. Walker J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6541-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) dnaX gene products. The consensus GXXGXGKT motif for nucleotide binding is conserved in all of these protein products. The dnaX homolog-encoded protein products also contain four Cys residues that form a putative zinc finger (marked with asterisks in Fig. 4). This putative zinc finger does not match the consensus site for zinc binding, but the crystal structure of δ′ reveals one atom of zinc coordinated to four Cys residues (10.Guenther, B. D. (1996) Structural Studies on the DNA Replication Apparatus: X-ray Crystal Structure of the δ′ Subunit of Escherichia coli DNA Pol III. Ph.D. thesis, Rockefeller University.Google Scholar). δ′ is a protein subunit of the γ complex clamp loader and is homologous to the γ and τ proteins (15Dong Z. Onrust R. Skangalis M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11758-11765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These Cys residues that participate in coordinating zinc in δ′ are conserved in the E. coli γ/τ proteins. Indeed, the E. coliγ and τ proteins bind one atom of zinc. 3J. Turner and M. O'Donnell, umpublished atomic adsorption results. Overall, the level of amino acid identity of the T. thermophilis dnaX homolog to both E. coli dnaX and the B. subtilis dnaX homolog in the N-terminal 165 residues is 537. After this region of identity, the C-terminal region of the T. thermophilis dnaX homolog shares 267 and 207 identity toE. coli dnaX gene and the B. subtilis dnaXhomolog, respectively.

Complexes between two chain urokinase (tcuPA) and plasminogen activator type 1 are degraded rapidly whereas single chain urokinase (scuPA) is not, suggesting that α2MR/LRP requires specific epitopes in the serpin for effective function. We report an alternative mechanism that may contribute to this process. The binding of scuPA to LM-TK− cells that lack the uPA receptor was stimulated by the hexapeptide EEIIMD, corresponding to amino acids 350–355 of plasminogen activator type 1, which contacts the sequence RHRGGS, corresponding to amino acids 179–184 in uPA. EEIIMD increased theB max of scuPA binding 4-fold with the half-maximal effect achieved at a peptide concentration of 50 ॖm. Stimulation was dependent on the charge on the COOH-terminal amino acid but not on the NH2 terminus of the peptide. EEIIMD also stimulated the internalization and degradation of scuPA. Both the binding and internalization of scuPA in the presence of EEIIMD were blocked by recombinant, 39-kDa α2MR/LRP-associated protein as well as by an anti-α2MR/LRP antibody. EEIIMD also stimulated the binding of scuPA to purified α2MR/LRP. EEIIMD had no effect on the binding of tcuPA or of complexes between scuPA and its receptor. These results suggest that EEIIMD regulates the binding of scuPA with α2MR/LRP.

The complex formed between PAI-1 and tcuPA binds to α2MR/LRP with considerably higher affinity than does either component alone. The increased affinity of the complex results from an independent contribution of epitopes present in each ligand (18Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd III, R.F. van Zonnefeld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25668-25676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but a possible effect of PAI-1 on the conformation of uPA itself has not been excluded (19Higazi A.A.-R. Upson R. Cohen R. McCrae K.R. Manuppello J. Bognacki J. Henkin J. Kounnas M. Strickland D. Preissner K.T. Lawler J. Cines D.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 542-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this context it is of interest that binding of scuPA to its receptor inhibits its binding to α2MR/LRP (18Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd III, R.F. van Zonnefeld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25668-25676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Higazi A.A.-R. Upson R. Cohen R.

Again, two mechanisms for this reduced affinity have been postulated. It has been proposed that the contact site between the A chain of scuPA and α2MR/LRP is shielded by uPAR (18Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd III, R.F. van Zonnefeld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25668-25676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism is that binding of scuPA to uPAR induces a conformational change that both promotes its binding to integrin ligands and leads to a loss of the epitope recognized by α2MR/LRP (19Higazi A.A.-R. Upson R. Cohen R. McCrae K.R. Manuppello J. Bognacki J. Henkin J. Kounnas M. Strickland D. Preissner K.T. Lawler J. Cines D.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 542-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter possibility is consistent with the observation that soluble scuPA has a higher affinity for α2MR/LRP than does tcuPA (18Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd III, R.F. van Zonnefeld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25668-25676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with the loss of affinity for α2MR/LRP which occurs when the active site of tcuPA is occupied by diisopropyl fluorophosphate (18Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd III, R.F. van Zonnefeld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25668-25676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine in greater detail the mechanism by which urokinase is recognized by α2MR/LRP we studied the effect of a hexapeptide derived from the docking site in PAI-1 on the cellular binding, internalization, and degradation of scuPA and tcuPA. The results of this investigation indicate that this peptide increases the recognition of scuPA, but not tcuPA, by α2MR/LRP. The data are compatible with the notion that scuPA is subject to 舠allosteric舡 regulation through an interaction with the docking site of PAI-1, as a result of which the molecule undergoes a conformational change that modulates its biologic activity. Recombinant scuPA and recombinant soluble urokinase receptor (suPAR) were purified as reported previously (16Higazi A.A.-R. Mazar A. Wang J. Reilly R. Henkin J. Kniss D. Cines D.

The peptides EEIIMD, REIIMD, and EEIIMR were synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Laboratory, Washington University, St. Louis. Glu-plasminogen, tcuPA, PAI-1, and the plasmin chromogenic substrate Spectrazyme PL were obtained from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Purified α2MR/LRP and recombinant soluble 39-kDa α2MR/LRP-associated protein (rRAP) were prepared as described previously (21Williams S.E. Aschcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LM-TK− cell line was obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (Rockville, MD). scuPA, suPAR, and tcuPA were radiolabeled with 125I using IODO-BEADS (Pierce Chemical Co.) as described (22Barnathan E.S. Kuo A. Rosenfeld L. Kariko K. Leski M. Robbiati F. Nolli M.L. Henkin J. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2865-2872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). suPAR and scuPA were incubated with each other at a molar ratio of 1.25:1 for 1 h at 37 °C at 10 × the desired final concentration in ligand binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1.07 bovine serum albumin (BSA)). To form complexes with PAI-1, the inhibitor was added to scuPA, tcuPA, or complexes containing suPAR·scuPA and suPAR·tcuPA at a 1:1 molar ratio in binding buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. The complexes were diluted to the desired working concentration immediately before use. tcuPA (5 nm) was incubated in the absence or presence of EEIIMD or REIIMD (200 ॖm) for 30 min. The mixture was then added to a reaction mixture containing 25 nm PAI-1, 50 nmGlu-plasminogen, and 50 ॖm chromogenic substrate for the indicated times, and the O.D. at 405 nm was measured continuously (16Higazi A.A.-R. Mazar A. Wang J. Reilly R. Henkin J. Kniss D. Cines D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3545-3549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of radiolabeled ligands to cells was measured as described (19Higazi A.A.-R. Upson R. Cohen R. McCrae K.R. Manuppello J. Bognacki J. Henkin J. Kounnas M. Strickland D. Preissner K.T. Lawler J. Cines D.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 542-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, LM-TK−cells, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 107 fetal calf serum, were plated in 96-well Falcon multiwell tissue culture dishes (Becton Dickinson) and grown to confluence at 37 °C overnight. The cells were prechilled for 1 h on ice and washed twice with prechilled binding buffer (phosphate- buffered saline and 1.07 BSA). 125I-Labeled ligands, with or without 100-fold molar excess unlabeled ligands, were added to the cells in the presence or absence of the aforementioned peptides for 2 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed four times with binding buffer, solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH, and the extract counted for radioactivity. In other experiments, binding of labeled ligands was performed in the absence or presence of 400 nmrRAP in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 4 mmCa2+ or in the presence of affinity-purified IgG anti-α2MR/LRP antibody (100 ॖg/ml). To measure the binding of labeled ligands to α2MR/LRP, 96-well microtiter (Dynatech Immulon) was incubated with purified receptor or BSA (3 ॖg/ml) in TBS containing 4 mm Ca2+ overnight at 4 °C. The buffer was removed, and the unreactive sites were blocked with a solution containing TBS, 4 mm Ca2+, 0.057 Tween 20, and 37 BSA for 1 h and then incubated with the same buffer in the presence or absence of rRAP (200 nm) for another h. Binding of 125I-labeled ligands to immobilized α2MR/LRP was determined as described previously (19Higazi A.A.-R. Upson R. Cohen R. McCrae K.R. Manuppello J. Bognacki J. Henkin J. Kounnas M.

LM-TK− cells were grown to confluence in 48-well Falcon multiwell tissue culture dishes (Becton Dickinson) overnight at 37 °C. The cells were prechilled on ice for 1 h, washed twice with binding buffer (TBS, 4 mmCa2+, 1.07 BSA), and incubated with the same buffer or with buffer supplemented with either 400 nm rRAP or 100 ॖg/ml IgG anti-α2MR/LRP for 1 h at room temperature. The binding buffer was removed. 125I-scuPA was added alone or in the presence of each of the three peptides and in the presence or absence 400 nm rRAP or 100 ॖg/ml anti-α2MR/LRP for 2 h at 4 °C. Unbound ligands were removed, and cells were washed five times with binding buffer. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4 mmCa2+ in the presence and absence of 400 nm rRAP or 100 ॖg/ml anti-α2MR/LRP was added for 18 h at 37 °C. The internalization and degradation of scuPA were measured as described previously (24Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Li H. Kuo A. Kochan J. Strickland D. Kariko K. Barnathan E.S. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8153-8158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, to measure internalization, the cells were washed twice with the binding buffer and 50 mmglycine, 150 mm NaCl, pH 3.0, was added for 15 min at 4 °C to dissociate cell surface-bound ligands. The cells were dissolved by adding 0.1 n NaOH for 10 min, and the extract was counted. To measure degradation, the media were removed after an 18-h incubation with radiolabeled ligands at 37 °C, trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 107, the precipitated protein was separated by centrifugation, and the radioactivity in the supernatant was measured. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a small peptide, EEIIMD (amino acids 350–355), derived from the putative docking site of PAI-1 (14Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F. Gerard R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21423-21426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), would alter the cellular binding and clearance of uPA mediated by α2MR/LRP. To address these questions, we studied the effect of this peptide on the binding, internalization, and degradation of scuPA, scuPA·suPAR complex, and tcuPA by LM-TK− cells that express α2MR/LRP but lack endogenous uPAR (19Higazi A.A.-R. Upson R. Cohen R. McCrae K.R. Manuppello J. Bognacki J. Henkin J. Kounnas M. Strickland D. Preissner K.T. Lawler J. Cines D.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 542-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Fig.1 A indicate that minimal amounts of scuPA bind to LM-TK− cells, consistent with previous results (19Higazi A.A.-R. Upson R. Cohen R. McCrae K.R. Manuppello J. Bognacki J. Henkin J. Kounnas M. Strickland D. Preissner K.T. Lawler J. Cines D.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 542-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, binding of scuPA to these cells was stimulated by the peptide EEIIMD in a dose-dependent and saturable manner both with respect to scuPA concentration (Fig.1 A) as well as peptide concentration (Fig. 1 B). Stimulation was evident at all concentrations of scuPA tested, and the increase in scuPA binding in the presence of EEIIMD occurred in part as a result of a 4-fold increase in the B max (Fig.1 A). By Scatchard analysis, little specific binding of scuPA to LM-TK− cells was detected in the absence of EEIIMD (K d = >1 ॖm), whereas scuPA bound with a K d of approximately 35 nm in the presence of the peptide (not shown). Half-maximal stimulation was achieved at a peptide concentration ≈ 50 ॖm, with the near maximal effect being observed at ≈ 300 ॖmpeptide (Fig. 1 B). Studies were then performed to identify the requirements for EEIIMD to stimulate the binding of scuPA. It has been reported that substitution of glutamic acid by arginine at position 350 does not affect the capacity of PAI-1 to inhibit tcuPA, whereas substitution of aspartic acid for arginine at position 355 renders PAI-1 totally inactive (14Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F. Gerard R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21423-21426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined how modification of these two amino acids individually would alter the stimulatory effect of the hexapeptide on the binding of scuPA to LM-TK− cells. The results shown in Fig. 1 A indicate that REIIMD was almost as potent as the parent sequence EEIIMD in this regard. In contrast, EEIIMR, with aspartic acid substituted for arginine at position 6, lost approximately 807 of the stimulatory capacity of the native peptide (Fig. 1). Experiments were then performed to examine the effect of EEIIMD on the binding of scuPA to LM-TK− cells in the presence of the parent PAI-1 molecule. Preincubation with PAI-1 increased the binding of 125I-scuPA minimally (Fig.2), consistent with the low affinity of the interaction between the two ligands (11Kruithof E.K.O.

The stimulatory effect of EEIIMD on the binding of scuPA was identical in the presence or absence of PAI-1, suggesting that the peptide was better able to gain access to the corresponding site in scuPA than was the larger PAI-1 molecule and that PAI-1 did not displace the peptide from scuPA. The complex between scuPA and its receptor suPAR (scuPA·suPAR) as well as tcuPA are both active enzymes (10Higazi A.A.-R. Cohen R.L. Henkin J. Kniss D. Schwartz B.S. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17375-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) but differ in their susceptibility to PAI-1 (16Higazi A.A.-R. Mazar A. Wang J. Reilly R. Henkin J. Kniss D. Cines D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3545-3549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This led us to question whether the docking site in the scuPA·suPAR complex is available to PAI-1 as has been reported for tcuPA. To address this question, we compared the effect of PAI-1 and EEIIMD on the binding of scuPA·suPAR and tcuPA to LM-TK− cells. PAI-1 and EEIIMD each caused a minimal increase in the binding of scuPA·suPAR to LM-TK− cells (Fig. 3). On the other hand, PAI-1 clearly stimulated the binding of tcuPA·suPAR as reported by others (18Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd III, R.F. van Zonnefeld A.-J.

EEIIMD also failed to stimulate the binding of tcuPA to LM-TK− cells (not shown). The failure of EEIIMD to stimulate the binding of tcuPA, tcuPA·suPAR, or scuPA·suPAR complexes to the LM-TK−cells could occur as a result of the inability of the peptide to bind to the docking site, or the effect of EEIIMD may be highly dependent on the conformational state of uPA. To address the question of whether EEIIMD can bind to the docking site, we measured the capacity of the peptide to compete with the plasminogen activator inhibitor activity of PAI-1 using tcuPA. The data shown in Fig.4 indicate that EEIIMD inhibits the activity of PAI-1, whereas the control peptide EEIIMR did not (not shown).Figure 4Effect of EEIIMD on the plasminogen inhibitor activity of PAI-1. tcuPA (5 nm) was incubated in the absence or presence of EEIIMD or REIIMD (200 ॖm) for 30 min. The mixture was then added to a reaction mixture containing 25 nm PAI-1, 50 nm Glu-plasminogen, and 50 ॖm chromogenic substrate for the indicated times, and the O.D. at 405 nm was measured continuously. The results are representative of three experiments so performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is well described that complexes between urokinase and PAI-1 are internalized and degraded by binding to α2MR/LRP (25Li H.

Therefore, we asked whether EEIIMD increased the binding, internalization, and degradation of scuPA through this pathway. In support of this hypothesis, EEIIMD stimulated the binding of scuPA to purified α2MR/LRP and binding, to the purified protein was inhibited by rRAP (Fig.5 A). In addition, the binding of scuPA to LM-TK− cells in the presence of EEIIMD was inhibited by 400 nm rRAP and by affinity-purified anti-α2MR/LRP IgG by approximately 70 and 857, respectively (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, EEIIMD stimulated the internalization and degradation of scuPA by LM-TK− cells (Fig. 6), and the EEIIMD-induced internalization/degradation were inhibited 70 and 807, respectively, by 400 nm rRAP and anti-α2MR/LRP IgG (Fig.6).Figure 6Effect of EEIIMD on the internalization and degradation of scuPA.

The results of the current study identify another mechanism by which the function of scuPA can be altered. The binding of scuPA to LM-TK− cells is stimulated by the PAI-1-derived peptide EEIIMD. The observations that the increase in binding of scuPA is accompanied by its internalization and degradation and that these consequences are prevented by rRAP as well as by a specific anti-α2MR/LRP antibody are consistent with the involvement of α2MR/LRP in this process. This contention is supported further by the finding that EEIIMD increases the binding of scuPA to purified α2MR/LRP and that this augmentation is also inhibited by rRAP. Therefore, these results suggest a potential mechanism by which scuPA can be cleared which is independent of receptor binding or proteolytic activation (10Higazi A.A.-R. Cohen R.L. Henkin J. Kniss D. Schwartz B.S. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17375-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although it has been postulated that binding of tcuPA·PAI-1 to α2MR/LRP is mediated by independent epitopes in each molecule (18Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd III, R.F. van Zonnefeld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25668-25676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), such a mechanism is unlikely to explain the stimulatory effect of EEIIMD on scuPA binding in that it is unlikely that the peptide is large enough to accommodate both proteins simultaneously. Further, EEIIMD bound to the docking site in tcuPA, as shown by inhibition of PAI-1 activity, but did not increase its binding to α2MR/LRP. Therefore, the observation that EEIIMD increased the B max for scuPA suggests that the peptide induces previously unrecognized cellular binding sites that are not available in the native molecule which are recognized by α2MR/LRP, i.e. that the docking sequence to which EEIIMD binds functions as an allosteric site. Consistent with this notion, whereas EEIIMD stimulated the binding of scuPA, the peptide had no effect on the binding of either the scuPA·suPAR complex or tcuPA. These results are consistent with the reported differences in the ability of scuPA, the scuPA·suPAR complex, and tcuPA to interact with α2MR/LRP (18Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd III, R.F. van Zonnefeld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25668-25676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that EEIIMD regulates the affinity with which scuPA binds to α2MR/LRP indicates that the docking site for PAI-1 is accessible to the peptide. This finding suggests that the resistance of scuPA to PAI-1 may occur because docking of the serpin does not facilitate its binding to the catalytic site as occurs in tcuPA (14Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F. Gerard R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21423-21426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because of an inappropriate distance between the sites in scuPA compared with tcuPA, differences in the orientation of the docking and catalytic sites in the two molecules, or a failure of the serpin to interact with the catalytic site. It is likely that EEIIMD fails to stimulate the cellular binding of tcuPA, although it binds to the docking site, because the peptide is unable to induce the site recognized by α2MR/LRP. A similar mechanism may also account for the failure of EEIIMD to induce the binding of the other active form of uPA, scuPA·suPAR. Alternatively, the binding site for α2MR/LRP on scuPA may be induced and shielded by its receptor, consistent with the capacity of uPAR to block the interaction of tcuPA·PAI-1 and scuPA with α2MR/LRP (18Nykjaer A.

Thus, conversion of scuPA to tcuPA is associated with the loss of the ability of EEIIMD to induce the structure recognized by α2MR/LRP, presumably as a result of the loss of coordinate interaction between different portions of the molecule. Support for this interpretation comes from the observations that uPAR has little or no effect on the enzymatic activity of tcuPA (10Higazi A.A.-R. Cohen R.L. Henkin J. Kniss D. Schwartz B.S.

These results provide additional support for the concept that the conversion of scuPA to tcuPA is the first step in its inactivation and degradation. Irrespective of the sequence of events, the capacity of EEIIMD to stimulate the binding of scuPA provides additional support for the notion that the biologic activity of scuPA can be regulated through its docking site, as a result of which the internalization and degradation of the protein are accelerated. Thus, it is not necessary that scuPA be converted to tcuPA for the protein to be recognized by α2MR/LRP (18Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A.

It remains to be established whether there exists a physiologic analog for the activity of EEIIMD described in this study."

A., Calcutt, M. J., Marchbank, M. T., Peletskaya, E. N., and Deutscher, S. L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 12241–12246). In the present study, the role of separate HCDR3 residues of DNA-1 in interaction with oligo(dT) was elucidated. Based on a molecular model of the combining site, residues at the base (Arg98 and Asp108) and in the middle (Tyr101-Arg-Pro-Tyr-Tyr105) of HCDR3 were predicted to support the loop conformation and directly contact the ligand, respectively. Twenty-five site-specific mutants were produced as hexahistidine-tagged proteins, purified, and examined for binding to (dT)15 using two independent methods. All mutations in the middle of HCDR3 led to either abolished or diminished affinity. Tyr101 likely participates in hydrogen bonding, while Tyr104 and Tyr105 may be involved in aromatic-aromatic interactions with the ligand. The residues Arg102 and Pro103 were not as critical as the tyrosines. It is speculated that HCDR3 interacts with the thymines, rather than the phosphates, of the ligand. A 3-fold increase in affinity was observed by mutation of Asp108 to alanine. The highly conserved Arg98 and Asp108 do not appear to form a salt bridge. The heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) of the anti-oligo(dT) recombinant antibody fragment, DNA-1, contributes significantly to antigen binding (Komissarov, A. A., Calcutt, M.

Antibodies comprise a valuable class of protein produced in mammals and other species in response to antigen. The importance of antibodies is highlighted by their vital roles in immune protection. Mammalian immune systems are capable of generating millions of different antibody specificities in response to foreign antigens. For unknown reasons, a breakdown in immune tolerance can occur resulting in activation of self-reactive B and T cells. This abnormal cascade of events leads to autoimmune disease. A hallmark of the autoimmune disorders systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 1The abbreviations used are: SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; ds, double-stranded; Fab, antigen binding fragment(s); ss, single-stranded; MRL/lpr, MRL/MpJ-lpr/lpr; H, heavy; L, light; CDR, complementarity-determining region(s); NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TNM, tetranitromethane; Fv, variable region; ΔΔG°, ΔG°mutant − ΔG°DNA-1. and mixed connective tissue disease is the presence of serum antibodies that recognize nucleic acids (1Tan E.M.

Deutscher S.L. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 1837-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The presence of high levels of circulating antibodies that bind double-stranded (ds) DNA is diagnostic for SLE, and certain anti-DNA immune complexes contribute to disease pathology (4Pisetsky D.S. Grudier J.P. Gilkeson G.S. Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 33: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Stollar B.D. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is uncertain what are the distinguishing features of pathogenic versus non-pathogenic antibodies, however. Studies of the binding properties of anti-DNA antibodies have been facilitated by methods to select for DNA-binding antibody fragments (Fab) from bacteriophage display libraries and the ability to produce large quantities of the Fab in Escherichia coli. We previously isolated an anti-single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding Fab, DNA-1, from a bacteriophage display library derived from the immunoglobulin repertoire of an autoimmune MRL/MpJ-lpr/lpr (MRL/lpr) mouse (6Calcutt M.J. Kremer M.T. Giblin M.F. Quinn T.P. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 137: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The MRL/lpr murine library was enriched in anti-DNA Fab since these mice spontaneously produce anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA antibodies and develop an SLE-like syndrome. DNA-1 was shown to preferentially bind to oligo(dT) of 15 nucleotides or greater in length, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) of 150–200 nm (7Calcutt M.J. Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T.

The regions responsible for DNA binding are known to reside in the three heavy (H) and light (L) chain complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the Fab. It has been shown that the H chain contributes more to the interaction with DNA than the L chain (9Kabat E.A. Padlan A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 85: 6885-6889Google Scholar). Comparison of HCDR transplantation mutants between DNA-1 and a Fab that bound poorly to DNA demonstrated that HCDR3 of DNA-1 was critical for oligo(dT) binding (7Calcutt M.J. Komissarov A.A.

Previous data generated from x-ray analyses of anti-protein antibodies indicated that HCDR3 does not participate in secondary structure formation and represents a loop, often with a putative salt bridge at its base (15Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar) that may function to stabilize loop conformation. That HCDR3 loop residues are critical in antigen recognition has been demonstrated in a limited number of studies (16Rumbley C.A. Denzin L.K. Yantz L. Tetin S.Yu. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13667-13674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Brummell D.A. Sharma V.P. Anand N.N. Bilous D. Dubic G. Michniewicz J. MacKenzie C.R. Sadowska J. Sigurskjold B.W.

In the present study, the role of amino acid residues of HCDR3 of DNA-1 in oligo(dT) interaction was examined. Two regions were chosen for mutagenesis experiments based on a molecular model of DNA-1: (i) residues in the middle of HCDR3 (Tyr101-Arg-Pro-Tyr-Tyr105), and (ii) the amino acids Arg98 and Asp108 at the base of the loop, which have been proposed to form a salt bridge. Both fluorescence quenching titration (8Komissarov A.A. Calcutt M.J. Marchbank M.T. Peletskaya E.N. Deutscher S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12241-12246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and a Ni-NTA-agarose radioimmunoassay (19Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T. Deutscher S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) were used for comparison of the affinities of 25 purified HCDR3 mutants of DNA-1. The data obtained highlighted the critical role of tyrosine residues in the central portion of HCDR3 in proper Fab-oligonucleotide complex formation. A change in the size as well as an increase in the negative charge of the HCDR3 loop resulted in a loss of ssDNA binding, while elimination of the sole carboxylic group resulted in increased affinity for (dT)15. Gamma-bind Sepharose, Sephadex G-50M, and a Mono-S column were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Ni-NTA-agarose was purchased from Qiagen Corp. (Chatsworth, CA). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Protein molecular weight standards were from Novex (San Diego, CA). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Fisher unless otherwise noted. The (dT)15 was synthesized by the University of Missouri DNA Core Facility, using an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer (model 380B), reverse-phase column purified and quantitated spectrophotometrically (20Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and terminally phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated radioactivity was removed by separation on Chroma Spin-10 columns (CLONTECH). The framework region of DNA-1 was modeled on the crystal structure of the mouse anti-hapten antibody R19.9 because of the high sequence homology with DNA-1 and because five out of six CDRs were identical in length to their counterparts (21Lascombe M.B. Alzari P.M. Boulot G. Saludjian P. Tougard P. Berek C. Haba S. Rosen E.M. Nisonoff A. Poljak R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The DNA-1 sequence was aligned with the R19.9 sequence and then substituted into the R19.9 structure using the biopolymer and homology modeling tools present in SYBYL (Tripos, Inc). Once the framework of DNA-1 was completed, the CDRs were added to the model. The loop structure of the HCDR3 from DNA-1, which differed in sequence length from that of antibody 19.9 by an additional two residues, was generated from the x-ray structure of HCDR3 of an anti-p185HER2 antibody of similar sequence and identical length (22Eigenbrot C. Randal M. Presta L. Carter P. Kossiakoff A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 969-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In accordance with the molecular model of the combining site (Fig. 1 A), HCDR3 represents a loop with the potential for formation of a salt bridge at its base as a result of the interaction of a conserved Arg98 residue in framework region 3 and Asp108 at the C terminus of HCDR3 (Fig.1 B). Results of x-ray analysis together with data from site-directed mutagenesis of different antibodies (15Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar, 16Rumbley C.A. Denzin L.K. Yantz L. Tetin S.Yu. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13667-13674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that residues in the central portion of the HCDR3 loop likely participate in direct interactions with the antigen at the combining site, while residues placed near the base of HCDR3 are more likely to contribute to the conformational support or flexibility of the loop. Therefore, the five residues in the middle of HCDR3 (Tyr101-Arg-Pro-Tyr-Tyr105) and two residues at the base of the loop (Arg98 and Asp108) were chosen for site-directed mutagenesis experiments to examine the possible contributions of the separate amino acid residues in complex formation.

Open table in a new tab VSX, a derivative of the plasmid pBC (Stratagene) containing a chloramphenicol resistance gene and lacking the VspI and SacI restriction enzyme sites, was used as an intermediate vector for mutagenesis and sequencing procedures. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using splice overlap polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (23Higuchi R. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, New York1990Google Scholar). Typically, two fragments of DNA-1 H chain DNA in VSX were amplified in two separate reactions using standard PCR conditions, resulting in fragments overlapping by at least 10 nucleotides. Full-length variable H + constant H1 products were generated by annealing and extension of the two overlapping fragments, and were amplified by 25 cycles of PCR following the addition of flanking T3 and T7 primers. The final products were purified, cut with XhoI andVspI restriction enzymes, and ligated into similarly cut DNA-1-VSX plasmid. Having verified that the desired mutation had been introduced, an XhoI-BamHI fragment containing the variable H region was subcloned intoXhoI-BamHI-cut DNA-1-pComb3, thus replacing the wild-type sequence. Using this two-step procedure, only a 140-nucleotide fragment derived from PCR was present in the final construct, thus reducing the amount of DNA sequencing necessary to check for possible mutations caused by Taq DNA polymerase errors. The correct mutation was verified by DNA sequencing using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The recombinant H and L chain DNA-1 and HCDR genes were cloned into pComb3/6-His (24Collet T.A. Roben P. O'Kennedy R.O. Barbas C.F. Burton D.R. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The Fab preparations were more than 957 pure, as evidenced by SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), and had aA 280/A 260 ratio > 1.90. Protein concentration was determined by a bicinchoninic acid method (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. DNA-1 was modified with TNM as described (27Sokolovsky M. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3582-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Portions (10 ॖl) of a 100 mm stock solution of TNM in acetonitrile were added to 1.0 ml of DNA-1 (20 ॖm) in 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature. After incubation for 30 min, excess reagent was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50M column. The number of modified tyrosine residues was estimated spectrophotometrically using a value of 2750m−1·cm−1 for the extinction coefficient of nitrotyrosine at 360 nm (27Sokolovsky M. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3582-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). To examine the ability of HCDR3 mutants of DNA-1 to bind oligonucleotide, a Ni-NTA microtiter plate radioimmunoprecipitation assay was utilized (19Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T. Deutscher S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Mixtures (200 ॖl) of 32P-labeled (dT)15 in 0.05 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, with 0.1m NaCl were incubated with increasing concentrations of Fab (5–2000 nm) in the wells of microtiter plates at room temperature for 15 min until equilibrium was established. To separate bound oligonucleotide from unbound, a 40-ॖl suspension of Ni-NTA-agarose was added to each mixture to trap the Fab-32P(dT)15 complex through the hexahistidine tag at the C terminus of the H chain (19Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T. Deutscher S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Immobilized complex was quantitatively eluted with 400 mm imidazole. All radioactive samples were counted using a Tri-Carb 2100 TR automatic liquid-scintillation analyzer (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, IL) for 2 min using an automatic 32P window. Changes in protein fluorescence at 346 nm (292 nm excitation) over the course of Fab-(dT)15 complex formation were measured as described previously (8Komissarov A.A. Calcutt M.J. Marchbank M.T. Peletskaya E.N. Deutscher S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12241-12246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The titrations were performed with varying amounts of oligonucleotide (5–20,000 nm) added to a fixed Fab concentration (10–60 nm) in 2 ml of 0.05 mTris/HCl, pH 7.0, with 0.1 m NaCl. Fluorescence titration experiments were carried out using a SLM 8100 spectrofluorimeter interfaced to a Dell/433 PC running SLM AMINCO 8100 series 2 software. The temperature of the cell compartment (25 °C) was controlled using a constant temperature cell holder connected to a circulating water bath, RTE-111 (NESLAB, Portsmouth, NH). The K d values for Fab-oligonucleotide complexes were determined from binding isotherms using a single binding site curve-fitting procedure as described previously (8Komissarov A.A. Calcutt M.J. Marchbank M.T. Peletskaya E.N. Deutscher S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12241-12246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our previous results (7Calcutt M.J.

In the present study, HCDR3 site-specific mutants were generated based on a molecular model of DNA-1 to better define amino acid residues important in ssDNA interaction and their possible contribution to the mechanism of antigen recognition. A molecular model for the DNA-1 variable region (Fv) was constructed to assist in the visualization of the amino acids located in the antigen combining site and to integrate experimental data with subsequent interpretation (Fig.1 A). Two regions of HCDR3 were the primary focus for directed mutagenesis experiments: the middle of HCDR3, which was predicted to participate in direct interaction with antigen, and residues Arg98 and Asp108 at the base of the loop, which may form a putative salt bridge to maintain the conformation of HCDR3 (Fig. 1 B) (28Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, three of the five residues in the middle of HCDR3 of DNA-1 are tyrosines. Antibody combining sites are often rich in aromatic residues (28Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 29Padlan E.A. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Biol. 1991; 217: 133-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) that have been shown to be important for the interaction with antigen (14Gulliver G.A. Rumbley C.A. Carrero J. Voss Jr., E.W.

Ueda Y. Watanabe K. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18551-18557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Possible mechanisms for antigen interaction include formation of hydrogen bonds by the phenolic hydroxyl group and aromatic-aromatic or hydrophobic interactions (33Tsumoto K. Ogasahara K. Ueda Y. Watanabe K. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18551-18557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, each tyrosine studied was first changed to a phenylalanine (Fab mutants Y101F, Y104F, and Y105F) to detect the possible involvement of the phenolic hydroxyl in hydrogen bonding (Table I). Mutation of Tyr101 and Tyr104 to His (Fab mutants Y101H and Y104H), was created to test the effects of changing the phenolic ring to an imidazole, on Fab affinity. Mutants Y101D, Y104D, Y101C, and Y105C were produced to examine the influence of addition of a negatively charged residue or group with reduced pK a to the top of HCDR3. In addition, two point mutants in position 101 (Y101S and Y101N) were created to explore the possible role of size and hydrophobicity of the side chain on ssDNA binding. The double mutant Y105F/A106V was generated to examine the influence of an increase in potential for hydrophobic interactions in this region of the HCDR3 loop. In accordance with the molecular model of DNA-1, HCDR3 was predicted to form a reverse turn at Pro103 (Fig. 1). Four substitution mutants (P103G, P103T, P103C, and P103R) were produced to explore the influence of the change in size and charge at this position on ssDNA affinity. Insertion and deletion mutations (mutant Fab −P103 and P103AA) were also created to study the role of the size of HCDR3 in the interaction with oligo(dT) (Table I). Combining sites of anti-DNA antibodies often contain arginines and lysines that can interact with the negatively charged phosphates of the antigen (2Stollar B.D. CRC Crit. Rev.

Three mutant variants with replacement of Arg102 (R102K, R102M, and R102T) and double mutant R102A/P103R were generated in an effort to identify the possible role of the positive charge at the top of HCDR3 loop and the effect of the shift of the arginine residue on the Fab-ssDNA complex formation, respectively (Table I). Finally, the role of the Arg98 and Asp108residues in supporting the functional integrity of the DNA-1 combining site was examined by generation of a 舠double mutant cycle舡 (38Carter P.J. Winter G.

Taking advantage of the principle of additivity (38Carter P.J. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 835-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 39Ackers G.K.

Individual HCDR3 site-directed mutant versions of DNA-1 were produced in E. coli DH12S (8Komissarov A.A. Calcutt M.J. Marchbank M.T. Peletskaya E.N. Deutscher S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12241-12246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and purified to homogeneity using affinity and ion-exchange chromatography (Fig.2 A) as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Results of SDS-PAGE analysis of the Fab employed in this study are shown in Fig. 2 (B andC). Samples of DNA-1 and all 25 HCDR3 mutants purified demonstrated neither a decrease in affinity or proteolysis after 6 months of storage at 4 °C. Changes in fluorescence emission induced by denaturation of Fab after incubation for 15 min at 35–60 °C (41Deutscher S.L. Crider M.E. Ringbauer J. Komissarov A.A. Quinn T.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) were used as an indicator of the influence of HCDR3 alterations on the overall structure of the molecule. Using this method, the thermostability of each mutant studied was similar to DNA-1 (data not shown). These results were in agreement with the supposition that HCDR3 plays a negligible role in the support of Fab structure. Ni-NTA precipitation of Fab-oligonucleotide complexes (19Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T. Deutscher S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was employed for the rapid and facile analysis of the binding properties of HCDR3 mutants and for the direct estimation ofK d values. All Fab studied contained a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus of their H chain (24Collet T.A. Roben P. O'Kennedy R.O. Barbas C.F. Burton D.R. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biophys. 1996; 333: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Since previous studies have shown that DNA-1 exhibits preferential specificity for oligo(dT) and has maximal affinity for a ligand 15 or more bases in length (7Calcutt M.J. Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 8Komissarov A.A. Calcutt M.J. Marchbank M.T. Peletskaya E.N. Deutscher S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12241-12246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), all binding experiments were performed with (dT)15. The Fab·32P-(dT)15 complexes were separated from unbound ligand by precipitation with Ni-NTA-agarose and quantitatively eluted with imidazole (19Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T. Deutscher S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The relative affinities of the Fab (500 nm) to (dT)15 (5 nm) are presented in Fig. 3. As shown, modification of DNA-1 with TNM and 11 of 25 HCDR3 mutations in DNA-1 resulted in a dramatic decrease in the ability of the Fab to bind (dT)15. All alterations that resulted in a significant decrease in the pK a, accompanied with an increase in the negative charge of the residue (Y101D, Y104D, Y101C, Y105C, P103C, modification with TNM), led to a significant decrease in binding ability. Mutants with a change in the length of HCDR3 (−P103 and P103AA) as well as both double mutants directed to the middle of the loop (R102A/P103R and Y105F/A106V) were also greatly diminished in their oligo(dT) binding ability. Therefore, neither the appearance of negatively charged groups (or groups possessing a lower pK a than tyrosine) at the top of HCDR3 nor alterations in the size of the loop were tolerated without a significant reduction in binding. The estimated affinities from titrations of 32P-(dT)15 with Fab are shown in Tables II andIII. These results demonstrated that any alteration to the top of HCDR3 resulted in decreased affinity, underscoring the importance of this region in ligand interaction (TableII)"

We show here that nerve growth factor (NGF), which induces neuronal differentiation and survival, causes a strong activation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat by a Ras/Raf-dependent mechanism in PC12 cells. Mutation of the κB sequences contained whithin the long terminal repeat reduces NGF-mediated stimulation. NGF does not activate NF-κB in PC12 cells, but rather increases binding of other nuclear factors to the κB sequences. Furthermore, a nuclear receptor response element contributes to the stimulatory effect of NGF. The retinoids receptors have been identified as components of the nuclear binding to the nuclear receptor response element in NGF-treated PC12 cells.

Altmeyer R. Chiron M. Wilt S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Viral infection of the brain leads to massive neuronal damage resulting in the AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) dementia complex. Studies in transgenic mice have revealed that the promoter of neurotropic HIV-1 strains directs gene expression in neurons throughout the nervous system (2Corboy J.R. Buzy J.M. Zink M.C. Clements J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1804-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results imply that neurons possess a specific transcription machinery capable of HIV-1 activation. Stimulation of HIV-1 gene expression is mediated through viral regulatory sequences located in the long terminal repeat (LTR). The HIV-1 LTR contains two binding sites for NF-κB (nucleotides −104 to −81) (3Kawakami K. Scheidereit C. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4700-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar) in close proximity to three binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 (nucleotides −77 to −46) (5Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Luciw P.A. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 232: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), and a cooperative interaction between both is required for activation (6Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L. Duckett C.S. Agranoff A.B. Schmid R.M. Nabel G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3551-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In primary cultures of neurons it has been described the existence of a constitutive NF-κB activity (7Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Neumann H. Wekerle H. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3981-3992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that appears to be responsible for the strong HIV-1 LTR activity found in transient transfection studies (8Rattner A. Korner M. Walker M.D. Citri J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4261-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Another transcription factor, BETA, present in neurons can also bind the NF-κB sites (8Rattner A. Korner M. Walker M.D. Citri J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4261-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Korner M. Rattner A. Mauxion F. Sen R. Citri Y. Neuron. 1989; 3: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recent data have demonstrated the existence of a nuclear receptor response element (NRRE) at sequences −352 to −320 (10Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5944-5951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor) has been described to activate HIV-1 gene expression in neuroblastoma and oligodendroglioma cells (11Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23572-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the retinoid receptors RAR and RXR have been described to play a role in stimulating HIV-1 expression in other cell types (12Lee M.-O. Hobbs P.D. Zhang X.-k. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5632-5636Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PC12 pheochromocytoma cells have been extensively used as a neuronal cell model. Upon treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF), PC12 cells acquire certain characteristics of sympathetic neurons (13Greene L.A. Tischler A. Adv. Cell. Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-414Crossref Google Scholar). Ligand activation of the NGF receptor tyrosine kinase, the trkA proto-oncogene product, leads to activation of Ras and of the serine/threonine kinase Raf, which acts downstream of Ras in the signaling pathway (14Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 15D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Mol. Cell.

The oncogenic form of Ras has been shown to stimulate the HIV-1 LTR in PC12 cells (17Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). A low-affinity receptor for NGF, p75NTR, which may also play a role in the signal transduction pathway of this neurotrophin, is also expressed at high levels in PC12 cells (18Radeke M.J. Misko T.P. Hsu C. Herzenberg L.A. Shooter E.M. Nature. 1987; 325: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that in the absence of TrkA, NGF binding to p75NTR activates NF-κB in Schwann cells (19Carter B.D. Kaltchimdt C. Kaltchimdt B. Offenhäuser N. BöhmMatthaei R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.-A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In this work we show that neuronal differentiation induced by NGF in PC12 cells is accompanied by a significant activation of the HIV-1 promoter. This activation requires Ras and Raf and appears to be mediated both by the κB sites and upstream sequences. However, PC12 cells do not contain constitutively active NF-κB complexes, and NGF treatment does not induce NF-κB. Other nuclear proteins, which bind to the NF-kB sites, are likely responsible for basal expression in PC12 cells. These proteins are induced by NGF. The neurotrophin also increases the amount of nuclear factors interacting with the NRRE, and we have identified RAR and RXR as important components of this in PC12 cells. Our results show the importance of specific cellular transcription factors in the regulation of the HIV-1 promoter in different cell types and suggest that neuronal differentiation could play an important role in the activation of HIV-1 gene expression. PC12 cells and the PC12 subline M-M17-26 (20Szeberényi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), that expresses the dominant negative mutant Ha-RasAsn17 were cultured in RPMI medium containing 107 donor horse serum and 57 fetal calf serum (21Cosgaya J.M. Aranda A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2651-2660PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmid containing HIV-1 LTR sequences from −453 to +80 fused to luciferase (−453HIV-Luc) has been described previously (17Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Additional deletion mutants of the HIV-1 LTR extending to −453, −104, −76, and −28 of the HIV-LTR were constructed by polymerase chain reaction with primers which provide a 5′XhoI site and a 3′ HindIII site. In the plasmid −453HIVmut-Luc, the GCG motif of both NF-κB binding sites located at −104/−76 has been mutated to TCT (17Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression vectors for oncogenic Ha-ras Val12, v-raf, the dominant inhibitory Ha-ras Asn17 mutant or a dominant negative raf lacking the catalytic domain under control of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter were also used (21Cosgaya J.M. Aranda A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2651-2660PubMed Google Scholar). Expression vectors for the truncated receptors RAR419 and RXR445 have been described previously (22Valcarcel R. Holt H. Garcı́a Jimenez C. Barettino D. Stunnenberg H.G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 3068-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 4 ॖg of the reporter constructs (21Cosgaya J.M. Aranda A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2651-2660PubMed Google Scholar). After overnight incubation with the calcium phosphate precipitate, the cells were incubated with 7 S NGF or TNFα and luciferase activity determined. When the cells were cotransfected with the reporter plasmid and expression vectors, the amount of DNA was kept constant by addition of the same amount of an 舠empty舡 noncoding vector (RSV-0). Each treatment was performed in triplicate cultures that normally exhibited less than 10–157 variation, and each experiment was repeated at least three times with similar differences in regulated expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed using 5 ॖg of nuclear extracts in a buffer containing approximately 30,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide, 0.1 ॖg of poly(dI-dC), 40 mm Hepes, pH = 7, 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.017 Nonidet P-40, 100 ॖg/ml bovine serum albumin, 47 Ficoll. After incubation, the samples were loaded onto a 4 or 67 nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The κB oligonucleotides used were: 5′-CAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGG-3′ with sequences −104 to −76 of HIV-1 LTR containing the κB-binding sites, 5′-CAATCTACTTTCCGCTGTCTACTTTCCAGG-3′ in which both binding sites are mutated, and 5′-TGCACAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGG-3′ containing the NF-κB site from the κ light chain enhancer. The B1 sequence, a κB sequence that binds BETA, but not NF-κB, complexes was 5′-GCCTGGGGAGCCTCCCTCAAC-3′. For supershift assays, antibodies directed against p50, p65, and NGFI-B purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, as well as specific antibodies against RARॆ and RXR kindly provided by P. Chambon, were mixed with the nuclear proteins for 15 min at 4 °C before addition of the probe. Oligonucleotides containing nuclear receptor binding sites were: 5′-CCAGGGGTCAGATATCCACTGACCTTTGG-3′ encompassing the NRRE present between −356 and −320 in the HIV-1 LTR and the palindromic element 5′-AGCTCTAGGTCATGACCTGA-3′, a strong response element that binds retinoic acid receptors (23Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). For SouthWestern analysis, 30 ॖg of nuclear extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After renaturation with guanidinium hydrochloride (from 6 to 0.35 m), the membrane was blocked with 57 nonfat milk and hybridized with 3.5 × 106 cpm of the LTR probe. To extract the proteins that recognize the region −104/−76 of the HIV-1 LTR, 50 ॖg of nuclear proteins were subjected to EMSA with 800,000 cpm of labeled probe. The retarded band was excised and the proteins run in a SDS-107 polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis the protein bands were detected by silver staining. As shown in Fig. 1 A, incubation of PC12 cells with NGF caused a dose-dependent activation of a luciferase construct containing the HIV-1 LTR (−453HIV-Luc). A half-maximal luciferase induction was obtained with approximately 20 ng/ml NGF, and this response was almost maximal at 50 ng/ml. The effect was maximal after 16 h of incubation with NGF and was maintained for at least 48 h (data not shown). However, UV light and TNFα, which are potent inducers of the HIV-1 LTR in other systems, had a weak effect (less than 2-fold activation) in PC12 cells, although both increased significantly the response to NGF (Fig.1 B). These results indicate that NGF functions as a potent HIV-1 transcriptional activator in PC12 cells. A series of 5′-deletion constructs derived from −453HIV-Luc, as well as a construct (−453mutHIV-Luc) in which both κB sites were mutated, were used to define the elements responsible for basal and NGF-stimulated HIV-1 expression in PC12 cells. Fig. 1 D shows that mutation of the κB sites very significantly decreased basal luciferase levels, showing that these elements are important for HIV-1 LTR activity in PC12 cells. However, a significant response to NGF was still observed with the mutated LTR. When expressed as fold induction over the corresponding basal levels, the response to NGF decreased from 7-fold in the wild type promoter to approximately 3-fold in the κB mutant. These results suggest that additional elements to the κB sites contribute to HIV-1 LTR activation by NGF. Deletion of the LTR from −453 to −104 did not alter basal luciferase activity. However, the response to the neurotrophin decreased significantly, showing that this promoter fragment is also involved in the regulation by NGF. This fragment is known to contain and Ets-1 binding site (24Sheridan P.L. Sheline C.T. Cannon K. Voz M.L. Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Jones C.A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2090-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and a NRRE (10Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5944-5951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A shorter LTR construct extending to −76, in which the κB sites are also deleted but the three Sp1 sites are still present, showed a low basal activity and only a weak response to NGF. Deletion to −28 produced a further decrease of luciferase activity and totally abolished the response to NGF. Ras and Raf proteins are involved in the responses to NGF in PC12 cells (14Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 15D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Jaiswal R.K. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Landreth G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6944-6953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of either oncogenic ras orraf dramatically enhanced the activity of the −453HIV-Luc construct in PC12 cells (Fig.2 A). In the presence of the activated oncogenes the signaling pathway was maximally stimulated and NGF did not induce a further increase. It has been reported in NIH-3T3 cells that the ras and raf oncogenes activate HIV-1 LTR expression through the κB binding sites (25Bruder J.T. Geidecker G. Tan T.-H. Weske J.C. Derse D. Rapp U.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5229-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the mutated promoter was still significantly activated by Ras and Raf in PC12 cells, showing that, as it occurs for NGF, additional sequences must be responsible for HIV-1 activation in this cell type. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the HIV-1 LTR was not stimulated by NGF in M-M17-26 cells, a PC12 subclone that constitutively expresses the dominant inhibitory ras Asn17 mutant (20Szeberényi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), showing that endogenous Ras is required for the effect of NGF. These results were confirmed in parental PC12 cells transiently transfected with ras Asn17. Fig.2 C shows that transfection with dominant inhibitoryras blocked NGF induction of luciferase activity. Expression of a negative inhibitory raf mutant also inhibited the stimulation of luciferase activity, showing that endogenous Raf proteins are also required for the regulation of the HIV-1 LTR by NGF. To examine whether activation of NF-κB was involved in the stimulation of the HIV-1 LTR by NGF in PC12 cells, nuclear proteins from untreated cells and from cells treated with NGF were subjected to EMSA. Fig. 3 A shows that NGF increased the abundance of proteins bound to sequences −104/−76 of the HIV-1 LTR. This effect was already observed after 4 h of NGF treatment and was maintained for at least 24 h (lanes 1–4). However, supershift experiments using specific antibodies against p65 and p50 did not show the presence of these proteins in the complexes (A, lanes 7–9). This absence was confirmed using the consensus NF-κB binding site of the murine κ-light chain enhancer. As shown in A, lane 10, nuclear extracts from PC12 cells produced the appearance of several retarded bands with this element. The amount of complexes with the slowest mobility was increased after NGF treatment, with a maximal effect again found at 4 h of incubation (lanes 11–13). As a control, the effect of NGF was compared with that caused by TNFα. Lane 14 shows that incubation for 30 min with TNFα activates NF-κB in PC12 cells. The identity of these complexes was confirmed by supershift analysis using antibodies against p50 (lane 19) and p65 (lane 20). It can be observed that the mobility of the p50 dimers and p50/p65 heterodimers is different from that of the complex whose intensity is augmented by NGF. These results show that PC12 cells do not contain significant amounts of constitutive NF-κB in the nucleus and that, in contrast to the results obtained in Schwann cells (19Carter B.D. Kaltchimdt C. Kaltchimdt B. Offenhäuser N. BöhmMatthaei R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.-A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), NGF binding to p75NTR does not activate NF-κB in PC12 cells. BETA, a brain-specific zinc finger transcription factor, can also bind to κB sites in neuronal cells (8Rattner A. Korner M. Walker M.D. Citri J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4261-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Korner M. Rattner A. Mauxion F. Sen R. Citri Y. Neuron. 1989; 3: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide (B1) that recognizes BETA but does not bind neuronal NF-κB was also used. Lane 21–23 show that nuclei from PC12 cells contain factors that bind strongly to B1 and that treatment with NGF weakly increases this binding. Although our data do not demonstrate whether the retarded band contains BETA or other still unidentified factors, these results confirm that factors different from NF-κB are constitutively present in PC12 cell nuclei. As shown in B, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the factors bound to the HIV-1 sequences −104/−76, demonstrated the presence of different proteins with varying sizes (from less than 40 to 115 kDa). C shows that a major band running approximately with the 63-kDa protein standard is detected by SouthWestern analysis with the HIV-1 probe. This species, whose expression is increased in NGF-treated PC12 cells, corresponded in size with the most prominent bands detected in B, which had an apparent molecular mass between 58 and 72 kDa. Taken together the results shown in Fig. 3 suggest that several κB-binding proteins could be involved in basal activity of the HIV-1 LTR in PC12 cells and that the level of these factors appear to increase after NGF treatment. The data shown in Fig. 1 D demonstrated that sequences upstream of the κB sites also significantly contribute to the response to NGF. These sequences contain Ets sites that appear to be important for activation of the HIV-1 enhancer in T cells (24Sheridan P.L. Sheline C.T. Cannon K. Voz M.L. Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Jones C.A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2090-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, Ets proteins do not appear to be involved in HIV-1 stimulation in PC12 cells (data not shown). Other potentially important sequence for HIV-1 expression is the NRRE at −356/−320. This element binds multiple members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (10Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5944-5951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23572-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Lee M.-O. Hobbs P.D. Zhang X.-k. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5632-5636Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), including orphan receptors and retinoid receptors (RAR and RXR). Recently, retinoids have been shown to activate several viruses, including HIV-1 (12Lee M.-O. Hobbs P.D. Zhang X.-k. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5632-5636Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To analyze a possible role of the retinoid receptors on the transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR by NGF, PC12 cells were transfected with expression vectors for truncated versions of RAR and RXR. The receptor RAR419 lacks the carboxyl-terminal region (AF-2), which is essential for ligand-dependent transactivation, and behaves as an inhibitor of activation by the normal receptor (22Valcarcel R. Holt H. Garcı́a Jimenez C. Barettino D. Stunnenberg H.G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 3068-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fig.4 A shows that RAR419 reduced NGF induction of the HIV-1 LTR. These results suggest that RAR participates in the regulation of HIV-1 LTR by NGF in PC12 cells and that the AF-2 region of the receptor is involved in this activation. In contrast, the AF-2 truncated receptor RXR445 significantly increased basal LTR activity. This enhancement could be attributable to the constitutive ligand-independent amino-terminal activation function (AF-1) of RXR (26Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It is also possible that RXR acts as a heterodimeric partner for RAR and/or other receptors. Several nuclear receptors require RXR for high affinity binding to their cognate elements, and the ligand-dependent transactivation function of RXR does not contribute to the transcriptional activity of the heterodimer (22Valcarcel R. Holt H. Garcı́a Jimenez C. Barettino D. Stunnenberg H.G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 3068-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The involvement of the NRRE on the regulation of the HIV-1 LTR by NGF was further analyzed in Fig. 4 B. Nuclear extracts from untreated PC12 cells caused the appearance of several retarded bands with an oligonucleotide encompassing the NRRE (lane 1), and incubation with NGF induced a clear increase in the level of the factors bound to the element (lane 2). This increase was rapid and was sustained for at least 24 h (lanes 7–10). As shown in lanes 3 and 4, the complexes were competed by an excess of unlabeled NRRE and also by a consensus palindromic element. Since this synthetic element binds retinoid receptors (23Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar), and recombinant RAR/RXR heterodimers strongly bind the NRRE (lane 5), the presence of RAR and RXR in the retarded bands was also examined. The supershift obtained with a specific anti-RXR antibody (lane 15) demonstrated that RXR is one of the factors bound to the NRRE in NGF-treated PC12 cells. Lane 16 shows that, besides RXR, RARॆ is present in the nuclear extracts from PC12 cells. The complexes from untreated PC12 cells were weakly supershifted in the presence of RARॆ antibodies (lane 13), and the intensity of the supershift increased in NGF-induced cells. These results show that the retinoid receptors are involved in the regulation of HIV-1 expression in PC12 cells, demonstrating a cross-coupling of the signal transduction of NGF with nuclear receptor pathways. Orphan receptors also appear to play a role in HIV-1 activation in neuronal and glial cells (12Lee M.-O. Hobbs P.D. Zhang X.-k. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5632-5636Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reinforcing the importance of this family of transcription factors as modulators of virus expression in brain and immune cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that the state of differentiation and the availability of neurotrophic factors may dictate the efficiency of the HIV-1 LTR function in neuronal cells. Because the LTR represents the main regulatory region that determines HIV-1 transcription and replication, these results suggest that the transduction of the NGF signal and its cross-coupling with nuclear receptor pathways may play a role in the infectious process of brain cells. The essential role of neurotrophins in the differentiation, survival, and function of neural cells is well established, and our data show that HIV-1 appears to opportunistically use an essential stimulator of these cells to favor its own expression. Interestingly, it has been very recently suggested that NGF may play an important role in the expression of the neuropathology caused in rat brain by administration of the HIV-1 viral protein gp120 (27Bagetta G. Corasaniti M.T. Aloe L. Berliochii L. Costa N. Finazzi-Agro A. Nesticò G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). At this point, further experiments are required to demonstrate that NGF can indeed play a role in virus replication and in the development of neurological damage in AIDS patients. We thank Drs. M. Karin, P. Chambon, and H. Stunnenberg for plasmids and antibodies used in this study."

Both mutants were observed to lose monooxygenase activity completely and generate H2O2 and pyruvate as reaction products. However, the mutants have much lower activities than a true l-lactate oxidase. The oxygen reactivities of the reduced and semiquinone forms of the mutant enzymes were significantly different from those of wild type enzyme. These results confirm our previous suggestion that the electronic interactions in the active site are a crucial factor that governs the oxygen reactivity of the enzyme (Sun, W., Williams, C.

The unique property of l-lactate monooxygenase within this family is that the oxidation product, pyruvate, dissociates slowly from the reduced enzyme, and that the reduced enzyme-pyruvate complex reacts rapidly with oxygen, as depicted in the inner pathway of Fig. 1 (13Hayaishi O. Sutton W.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 4809Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Lockridge O. Massey V. Sullivan P.A. J. Biol.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 243-289Google Scholar). The other members release their oxidation product rapidly from the reduced enzyme, thus following the outer pathway (or uncoupled pathway). The residue in glycolate oxidase and flavocytochromeb 2 corresponding to glycine 99 in LMO is an alanine, as shown in the crystal structures of these enzymes (3Lindqvist Y. Brändén C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3624-3628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Xia Z.X. Mathews S.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 837-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar,17Xia Z.X. Shamala N. Bethge P.H. Lim L.W. Bellamy H.D. Xuong N.H. Lederer F. Mathews S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2629-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The methyl side chain of the alanine extends toward the methyl group of the bound lactate on the si side of the flavin ring. It was of interest, therefore, to investigate the properties of LMO having glycine substituted with alanine. In particular, we predicted that the larger side chain would promote the dissociation of the product, pyruvate, leading to a high oxidase activity. In fact, less than 2-fold increase in the rate of pyruvate release from reduced enzyme was observed (18Sun W. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17226-17233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the rate of reaction of the reduced enzyme-pyruvate complex with oxygen is lower by a factor of 105 in G99A, resulting in its catalysis of an oxidase-type rather than a monooxygenase-type reaction. Concomitantly, similar mutagenesis was made to change the corresponding alanine residue in l-lactate oxidase from Aerococcus viridans to glycine, and the resultant mutant has been reported to have no change in the reaction mechanism but to show a high activity toward a series of longer chain α-hydroxy acids (19Yorita K. Aki K. Ohkuma-Soyejima T. Kokubo T. Misaki H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28300-28305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mutation in LMO G99A also caused a 100-fold decrease in the reactivity of oxygen with the free reduced enzyme as compared with wild type enzyme. Therefore, although the mutant enzyme functions as a lactate oxidase, it has a much lower oxygen reactivity than a true lactate oxidase. Within this family of enzymes, the protein exerts a precise control over the reaction of reduced flavin with oxygen by modulating the electronic interactions in the active site of the enzyme. In an effort to support our suggestion that electrostatic interactions in the active site are a crucial factor in controlling the oxygen reactivity, glycine 99 was changed to serine and threonine (referred to as G99S and G99T, respectively), in which the electrostatic interactions are expected to be affected further due to the larger size and polarity of the residues introduced, and the resultant mutants were studied extensively and reported here. Attempts to replace glycine with valine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine failed, presumably as a result of the small space around N(5) of the flavin, leading to the flavin dissociation from the protein. Materials and instrumentation were as described previously (18Sun W. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17226-17233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in 10 mm imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, and at 25 °C, unless otherwise indicated. Reaction solutions were protected from light as much as possible because LMO is very susceptible to photochemical formation of the semiquinone species. The mutagenesis of glycine 99 (codon GGG) to serine was performed with oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTCCCATCAGCGTCATA*GCGCTGTGCG-3′ with the codon for serine as underlined. The same oligonucleotide but with ACG at the underlined location was used for the mutagenesis to threonine. A silent mutation at residue isoleucine 101 as marked with an asterisk was also introduced to create an Eco47III site (5′-AGCGCT-3′). Successful mutagenesis was screened for the addition of the Eco47III site. The NcoI-MunI fragments (321 base pairs) were ligated into the appropriate position of the expression plasmid pUM01. Successful insertions were confirmed by digesting with Eco47III and finally by plasmid DNA sequencing. The mutant enzymes were grown in 6 × 1 liter of Terrific Broth and purified as described previously (8Müh U. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7982-7988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the protein was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) stained with Coomassie Blue. The extinction coefficients for mutant enzymes were determined by denaturing the protein with SDS as described previously (18Sun W. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17226-17233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The loading and reaction syringes were filled overnight with a mixture of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate dioxygenase to scrub oxygen from the stopped-flow apparatus and then rinsed with anaerobic buffer before loading enzyme and substrate solutions. Details of the instrumentation and analysis programs have been described previously (18Sun W. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17226-17233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The enzyme solution at a concentration of 10 ॖm was treated with alternate cycles of evacuation and reequilibration with oxygen-free argon in a tonometer. One syringe of the stopped-flow spectrophotometer was filled with the anaerobic enzyme solution, and the other syringe was filled with anaerobicl-lactate with concentrations varied from 5 to 200 mm. The l-lactate was made anaerobic in its syringe by bubbling with oxygen-free argon for 20 min. The reduction of enzyme-bound flavin was followed by the absorbance decrease at 460 nm. For the reverse reaction, G99S was reduced anaerobically by the addition of a 4-fold excess of l-lactate in a tonometer. One syringe of the stopped-flow apparatus was filled with reduced enzyme solution, and another syringe was filled with anaerobic pyruvate with concentrations varied from 1 to 100 mm. The pyruvate solution was made anaerobic by bubbling with oxygen-free argon for 20 min. The reoxidation of reduced flavin was followed by the absorbance increase at 460 nm. The anaerobiosis of the experiment was checked by mixing the reduced enzyme with anaerobic buffer. The enzyme remained as the reduced form for at least 30 min. This test was carried out at both the beginning and the end of the experiment. Excellent anaerobiosis was maintained during the experiments. The reductive half reaction was performed in an anaerobic cuvette by using 15.7 ॖm enzyme, and varied concentrations of l-lactate from 1.9 to 101 mm. The reaction was followed spectrally with time with a Hewlett-Packard diode array spectrophotometer (model 8452A). The absorbance decrease at 456 nm versus time was used to obtain the apparent rate constant at each l-lactate concentration. The reverse reaction was performed in an anaerobic stopped-flow spectrophotometer. G99T (10 ॖm) was first reduced by a 100-fold excess of l-lactate. One syringe of the stopped-flow apparatus was filled with reduced enzyme, and varied concentrations of pyruvate from 2.9 to 302 mm were loaded onto another syringe. The reaction was followed by the absorbance change at both 456 and 540 nm. The stopped-flow kinetic traces of the reductive half-reaction were simulated by using a computer analysis system called program A, prepared by Dr. D. P. Ballou, Chung-Jen Chiu, Rong Chang, and Joel Dinverno (University of Michigan). Initial estimates for the extinction coefficients and rate constants used in the simulation were taken from a quantitative analysis of the experimental data. The initial rate constants were then adjusted by improving the simulated data according to the measured traces until a best fit was obtained. Reduced G99S (∼20 ॖm) and G99T (∼10 ॖm) were made by the addition of one equivalent and 100-fold excess, respectively, of l-lactate anaerobically in a tonometer. The oxidation of flavin was observed in stopped-flow experiments with one syringe filled with reduced enzyme and the other syringe filled with 10 mm imidazole-HCl buffer, which was bubbled with varied oxygen concentrations for 20 min. The reaction was followed by observing the reoxidation of flavin at 460 nm. l-lactate monooxygenase was photoreduced using glycine as photoreductant and 5-deazaflavin as catalyst, as detailed previously (21Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 22Massey V. Hemmerich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5612-5614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thermodynamic stability of semiquinone was tested by the addition of 100 ॖm benzyl viologen. The spectrum of the mixture was followed for days. The concentration of G99S semiquinone remaining in the mixture at equilibrium was calculated by the absorbance change at 380 nm with the extinction coefficients of 16,500 m−1 cm−1 for semiquinone, 8,200 m−1 cm−1 for oxidized enzyme, and 5,470 m−1 cm−1 for reduced enzyme. The G99T semiquinone remaining in the mixture at equilibrium was calculated by the absorbance changes at both 384 and 456 nm. The extinction coefficients for the semiquinone are 18,000m−1 cm−1 at 384 nm and 3900m−1 cm−1 at 456 nm; for the oxidized enzyme, coefficients are 8400 m−1cm−1 at 384 nm and 13,200 m−1cm−1 at 456 nm; for the reduced enzyme, coefficients are 4500 m−1 cm−1 at 384 nm and 1600m−1 cm−1 at 456 nm. Enzyme semiquinone was made by photoreduction of oxidized enzyme as described above, until maximum semiquinone formation was achieved. One syringe of the stopped-flow apparatus was filled with the semiquinone solution, and the other syringe was filled with buffer, which was bubbled with varied concentrations of oxygen for 20 min. The reaction was followed by both the absorbance decrease at 400 nm and the absorbance increase at 460 nm. Semiquinone was formed by photoreduction and mixed with a large excess of pyruvate from the side arm of an anaerobic cuvette. The mixture was quickly passed through a Sephadex G-25 column at 4 °C to remove excess pyruvate. The remaining semiquinone-pyruvate complex was equilibrated to 25 °C to test its stability to air by following spectral changes with time. Enzyme turnover for the G99S-catalyzed reaction was determined by both the oxygen consumption at air saturation with an oxygen electrode and by the formation of H2O2, measuring its incorporation with HRP to form HRP-I at varied oxygen concentrations, as detailed previously (18Sun W. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17226-17233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The determination of H2O2 formation as a function of oxygen concentration at saturated l-lactate concentration yields the K m for oxygen and k cat of the l-lactate oxidation reaction catalyzed by G99S. Formation of H2O2 as product in the two mutant enzyme-catalyzed reactions was also measured colorimetrically by the HRP-catalyzed oxidation of o-dianisidine, as detailed previously (18Sun W. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17226-17233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). At air saturation, the reaction turnover was determined as a function of the concentration of l-lactate, and the apparent K m for l-lactate and apparent k cat of the reaction were therefore obtained. The oxidized G99S and G99T enzymes were titrated with sulfite, and the absorbance changes at 456 nm versus sulfite concentration were used to obtain the dissociation constants. The dissociation constant for the sulfite complex of G99A enzyme was also measured for comparison with those for G99S and G99T, but because of its low value the K d was determined kinetically. The on-rate was followed by stopped-flow traces at 456 nm at varied sulfite concentrations, and the off-rate was determined by incubation of fully formed complex with excess methyl methanethiosulfonate as described previously (15Ghisla S. Massey V. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. II. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 243-289Google Scholar). The mutant enzymes were first characterized by their absorption and fluorescence spectra. Details about the environment of the amino acid residues involved in substrate binding with respect to the flavin isoalloxazine ring were then measured by the binding of a transition state analog oxalate and a competitive inhibitor d-lactate. The finding that the mutant enzymes have much reduced reactivities with lactate leads to the test of the binding of sulfite with the mutant enzymes and the measurement of the redox potentials. Furthermore, one- electron reduction of the mutant enzymes was carried out to compare with the properties exhibited by wild type enzyme. The oxygen reactivities of fully reduced enzyme and anionic semiquinone were also measured and compared with wild type enzyme. Finally, reaction turnover measurements show agreement of the direct assay of H2O2 formation with rate constants determined by stopped-flow studies. In the liquid culture growth, the majority of either mutant enzyme was present as an insoluble form, as has been found for the wild type and other mutant forms of the enzyme (8Müh U. Massey V.

Typically, 60–70 mg of G99S and 40–50 mg of G99T were isolated from the soluble portion of the cell paste of 6 liters of culture. Unlike G99A enzyme, which is isolated as a mixture of a flavin N(5)-cysteine adduct and the normal flavin enzyme (18Sun W. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17226-17233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), pure G99S and G99T with normal flavin spectra were obtained by the isolation of enzyme following the usual purification procedure (8Müh U. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7982-7988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both G99S and G99T have the normal flavin absorbance characteristics, with the absorbance peak of wild type enzyme at 458 nm blue-shifted to 454 nm and the peak at 373 nm becoming broader and shifted to 371 nm for G99S (Fig.2 A). The absorbance peaks of G99T occur at 375 and 455 nm as shown in Fig. 2 B. A shoulder at 472–480 nm for G99S and at 473–480 nm for G99T becomes more pronounced than for the wild type enzyme and for G99A. The ratio of A280/A456 is 9.3 for G99S and 9.1 for G99T. The extinction coefficient at 456 nm was determined to be 12,655m−1 cm−1 for G99S and 13,200m−1 cm−1 for G99T. Like wild type enzyme and G99A, the oxidized mutant enzymes are nonfluorescent but become fluorescent upon reduction. The reduced enzymes show a maximum excitation at 365 nm for G99S and 360 nm for G99T and a maximum emission at 515 nm for G99S and 520 nm for G99T, close to the values for the wild type enzyme (λem = 507 nm) (25Ghisla S. Massey V. Lhoste J.M. Mayhew S.G. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and G99A (λem = 510 nm) (18Sun W. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17226-17233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of reduced G99S and G99T was about 2- and 4-fold, respectively, weaker than that for G99A. The absorption spectrum of wild type LMO is perturbed by the presence of most inorganic anions as competitive inhibitors (9Sullivan P.A. Choong Y.S. Schreurs W.J. Cutfield J.F. Shepherd M.G. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Lockridge O. Massey V. Sullivan P.A. J. Biol.

The effect of phosphate ion on the spectrum of the wild type enzyme appears as a large absorbance increase in the range of 350–490 nm with aK d value of 12.5 mm (14Lockridge O. Massey V. Sullivan P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8097-8106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of phosphate ion was observed to affect the absorption spectra of the oxidized mutant enzymes but in a completely different fashion from that with wild type enzyme. For G99S, the presence of phosphate ion causes an absorbance decrease in the ranges of 305–375 nm and 402–480 nm and an absorbance increase in the range of 375–402 nm as shown in Fig.2 A. The absorbance maximum at 371 nm was red-shifted to 375 nm upon binding of phosphate. The average K d value of 90 mm was obtained by measuring the absorbance changes at 320 and 392 nm versus the phosphate concentration, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2 A. A similar spectral change as for G99S occurs with G99T, with aK d value of 110 mm. Oxalate has been used as an analog of the presumed carbanion transition state of l-lactate oxidation by LMO (27Ghisla S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of oxalate with LMO induces a pronounced perturbation of the absorption spectrum of the oxidized enzyme. The difference spectrum between the uncomplexed and fully complexed forms of the wild type enzyme shows positive maxima at 391, 425, 450, and 483 nm and negative maxima at 370, 470, and 504 nm, with Δε = 2000m−1 cm−1 at 504 nm. The isosbestic points are at 323, 382, 462, 478, and 485 nm (27Ghisla S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of oxalate with mutant G99A has a difference spectrum similar to that with wild type enzyme. However, the binding of oxalate with either G99S or G99T shows significantly different interactions from those with wild type enzyme. For G99S, the isosbestic points are at 315, 377, 405, 445, and 510 nm. The positive maxima are at 389, 460, and 490 nm, and the negative maxima are at 350, 370, and 420 nm, with Δε = 1900m−1 cm−1 at 389 nm. The dissociation constant of the G99S-oxalate complex was determined to be 7.4 × 10−4m by monitoring the absorbance change at 389 nm as a function of oxalate concentration (see Table I). Binding of oxalate with G99S is therefore about 50-fold weaker than with the wild type enzyme, where aK d of 1.6 × 10−5mhas been reported (27Ghisla S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A K d of 3.3 × 10−4m was obtained for G99A (18Sun W. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol.

The negative maxima are at 355 and 503 nm. The isosbestic points are at 315, 380, and 493 nm.

Binding of oxalate with G99T is about 3–4 fold weaker than with the wild type enzyme. The G99S- and G99T-oxalate complexes also form photochemical adducts, as do wild type enzyme and G99A. However, the flavin N(5)-carbonate adducts of G99S- and G99T-oxalate so produced are nonfluorescent and stable for days with oxygen, similar to the adduct with G99A (18Sun W. Williams Jr., C.H.

https://openalex.org/W1981279704,"A still unresolved question regarding the mechanism of chaperonin-assisted protein folding involves the stoichiometry of the GroEL-GroES complex. This is important, because the activities of the Escherichia coli chaperonin GroEL are modulated by the cochaperonin GroES. In this report, the binding of GroES to highly purified GroEL in the presence of ATP, ADP, and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, 5′-adenylyl ॆ,γ-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), was investigated by using the fluorescence anisotropy of succinimidyl-1-pyrenebutyrate-labeled GroES. In the presence of Mg2+-ATP and high [KCl] (10 mm), two GroES7 rings bind per one GroEL14. In contrast, in the presence of ADP or AMP-PNP only one molecule of oligomeric GroES can be tightly bound by GroEL. With AMP-PNP, binding of a small amount (<207) of a second GroES can be detected. In the presence of ADP alone, a second GroES ring can bind to GroEL weakly and with negative cooperativity. Strikingly, addition of AMP-PNP to the solution containing preformed GroEL14(GroES7) complexes formed in the presence of ADP results in an increase in the fluorescence anisotropy. Analysis of this effect indicates that 2 mol of GroES oligomer can be bound in the presence of mixed nucleotides. A similar conclusion follows from studies in which ADP is added to an GroEL14 (GroES7) complex formed in the presence of AMP-PNP.

The relation of the observed phenomena to the proposed mechanism of the GroEL function is discussed. Although it is widely accepted that all the information required for proper folding of proteins is encoded entirely within the primary sequence (1Epstein C.J. Goldberger R.F. Anfinsen C.B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1963; 28: 439-449Crossref Google Scholar, 2Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5217) Google Scholar), it is also clear that molecular chaperones have evolved to assist in the efficient proper folding, trafficking, and assembly of proteins in vivo (3Georgopoulos C. Ang D. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 19-25PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). The most widely studied molecular chaperones are the GroE chaperonin proteins ofEscherichia coli, GroEL and GroES (3Georgopoulos C. Ang D. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 19-25PubMed Google Scholar). GroEL is a tetradecamer of 14 identical 57-kDa subunits arranged in two heptameric rings that are stacked upon one another back-to-back (6Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). This results in a cylindrical oligomer whose two ends are identical. GroEL possesses a weak, K+-dependent ATPase activity that is partially inhibited by the presence of GroES (7Hendrix R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilly K. Woolford C. Hendrix R.W. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol.

Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The quantized hydrolysis of ATP by GroEL has been proposed to provide the energy necessary for the release of polypeptide substrates (11Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar,12Gorovits B.M. Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6842-6845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). GroES is a heptamer of seven identical 10-kDa subunits arranged as a single ring (13Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). GroES regulates the activities of GroEL by the binding to GroEL of a large mobile loop from each GroES monomer (14Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar,15Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C. van der Vies S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11622-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has been shown that GroES is required for successful refolding of polypeptides by GroEL under conditions where spontaneous refolding of the substrate does not occur (16Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although much has been learned about the functions of GroEL and GroES, the detailed mechanism by which the chaperonins assist the refolding of proteins has not been definitively elucidated. One of the controversies surrounding the mechanism of GroEL-GroES action is the stoichiometry of the complex(es) involved. Electron microscopy has provided evidence for the existence of both 1:1 GroEL14(GroES7) and 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2 complexes under various conditions (reviewed in Ref. 17Saibil H. Ellis R.J. The Chaperonins. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 245-266Crossref Google Scholar). Schmidt et al. (18Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Viitanen P. Lorimer G.H. Buchner J. Science. 1994; 265: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) used electron microscopy to show that 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2 complexes could be formed in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, and using the kinetic data of Todd et al. (11Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), they suggested that the formation of 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2complexes preceded the rate-limiting step in the cycle. GroEL14(GroES7)2 complexes were identified by Azem et al.(19) using electron microscopy and chemical cross-linking. Those experiments also suggested that these 1:2 complexes were active in the refolding of RuBisCO in agreement with the proposal that GroEL14(GroES7)2complexes served a role in the chaperonin ATPase cycle proposed by Toddet al. (11Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been reported that the formation of 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2complexes occurs at unphysiologically high Mg2+concentrations and increased pH (20Engel A. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Goldie K.N. Pfeifer G. Hegerl R. Muller S. da Silva A.C.R. Baumeister W. Hartl F.U. Science. 1995; 269: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This latter work also showed that formation of GroEL14(GroES7)2complexes prevented the binding of unfolded polypeptide, calling into question the significance of 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2 complexes. Using surface plasmon resonance, another study from that group showed that stable GroEL14GroES7 complexes could be formed and dissociated with subsequent ATP hydrolysis with no intermediate formation of 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2complexes (21Hayer-Hartl M.K. Martin J. Hartl F.U. Science. 1995; 269: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Overall, it has been demonstrated that single site-directed mutations as well as nominal variations of solution conditions can have dramatic effects on the structure and function of GroEL. Therefore, the question of the role of the sometimes vigorous conditions required to demonstrate various complexes has not been directly addressed. In this report, we show using direct binding measurements that GroEL14(GroES7)2 complexes can be formed in the presence of ATP and high [KCl], although only one heptamer of GroES can be tightly bound to the oligomeric GroEL in the presence of ADP or AMP-PNP, 1The abbreviations used are: AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl ॆ,γ-imidodiphosphate; pyrene, succinimidyl-1-pyrenebutyrate; pyrene-GroES, GroES covalently labeled with pyrene. individually. Subsequent addition of either AMP-PNP or ADP to the preformed 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex results in formation of GroEL14(GroES7)2, suggesting that the 1:2 complex contains different nucleotides bound on the opposite rings. The relationship of the observed phenomenon to the proposed mechanism of the GroEL function is discussed. Succinimidyl-1-pyrenebutyrate was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). All reagents were of analytical grade. GroES and GroEL were purified as described previously (22Staniforth R.A. Cortes A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Clark A.C. Hugo E. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5893-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). The refolding activity of rhodanese by GroEL-GroES was measured as described previously (25Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22113-22115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For labeling of GroES with pyrene, GroES (3.2 mg/ml) was incubated in 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.8, for 2 h at room temperature with a 1.5 molar excess over oligomer of succinimidyl-1-pyrenebutyrate added from a stock solution in N,N-dimethylformamide. The labeling solution contained 57N,N-dimethylformamide. The sample was then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mmMgCl2 overnight at 4 °C to remove the free label. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed that there was no detectable noncovalently bound pyrene. The product contained 0.8 pyrene moieties per each oligomer of GroES. The pyrene adduct was quantified using εM(340 nm) = 43,000 m−1cm−1. The anisotropy of the pyrene-labeled GroES was recorded using a PC1 photon counting spectrofluorometer (ISS, Champaign, IL). For the anisotropy measurements, various concentrations of GroES were incubated with or without 160–200 nm GroEL in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, and either 0.5 or 10 mm KCl. The anisotropy was recorded within 1–3 min after the addition of specified nucleotide (ATP, ADP, or AMP-PNP). For ATP, this time was within the steady state phase of ATP hydrolysis, and the measurements were complete before ≈57 of the ATP had been consumed. In case of binding in the presence of mixed nucleotides, GroEL and GroES were incubated in the presence of ADP for 5 min, and the anisotropy was recorded 1 min after the addition of AMP-PNP. In all cases the excitation wavelength and the emission wavelength were set at 345 and 395 nm, respectively. The fraction of bound GroES7 was calculated from the following relationships, robs=(fbound)(rbound)+(ffree)(rfree)Equation 1 ffree=1−fboundEquation 2 Where r obs is the measured anisotropy for a given condition, f bound is the fraction of GroES7 bound, f free is the fraction of free GroES7, r bound is the anisotropy of bound GroES7, andr free is the anisotropy of free GroES7. The anisotropy of bound GroES7 is the value measured in an excess of GroEL14 and had a value ofr = 0.074 ± 0.001 in the presence of any of the nucleotides. The anisotropy of free GroES7 was measured in the absence of GroEL14, and it gave a value ofr = 0.029 ± 0.001 independent of the presence of nucleotide. There was no significant difference in the fluorescence intensity between the free and bound GroES7, indicating that no significant change in quantum yield was associated with binding. Anisotropy data obtained in the presence of ADP were fit to the Scatchard (Equation 3) and Hill (Equation 4) equations using nonlinear least squares methods implemented in PSI plot, BF=12K1(q1−B)+K2(q2−B)+{K1(q1−B)+K2(q2−B)}2+4K1K2q1q2Equation 3 where B and F are the concentrations of the bound and free ligand, respectively; K 1,K 2, and q 1 andq 2 are the binding constants and concentrations for the first and second binding sites, respectively (26Feldman H.A.

To directly evaluate the GroEL-GroES interaction in solution, the cochaperonin GroES was covalently labeled with succinimidyl-1-pyrenebutyrate, an amino group directed derivative of pyrene. Succinimidyl-1-pyrenebutyrate possesses a very long average fluorescence lifetime (>100 ns) that allows one to examine protein-protein interactions. GroES that was labeled in this manner was functional as assessed by its ability to support rhodanese refolding by GroEL (data not shown). Under conditions where the GroEL concentration was fixed and exceeded the K d of the GroEL-GroES interaction (30Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), addition of increasing GroES resulted in the progressive decrease of the fluorescence anisotropy values (r obs). By using Equations 1 and 2 (see 舠Materials and Methods舡) r obs was transformed to the concentrations of free and bound GroES (Fig.1 A). The ratios of [bound GroES7]/[total GroEL14] are given by the values on the ordinate. In this experiment the GroEL14concentration was 135 nm. In the presence of a high level of [KCl] (10 mm), the bound fraction of GroES sharply increased up to a value of approximately 270 nm, which corresponded to a 2:1 complex between GroES and GroEL (Fig.1 A, closed squares). These results are consistent with reports that 1:2 GroEL-GroES complexes can be detected under similar conditions by electron microscopy (18Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Viitanen P. Lorimer G.H. Buchner J. Science. 1994; 265: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) or chemical cross-linking (19Azem A. Kessel M. Goloubinoff P. Science. 1994; 265: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is interesting that at a low concentration of KCl (0.5 mm) only partial saturation of two binding sites on GroEL can be observed (Fig. 1 A, open squares). The line shown represents a nonlinear least squares fit to the acquired data. The observed stoichiometry of about 1.5 suggests that under such conditions the system contains both 2:1 and 1:1 complexes. The data were fit to an equation describing a sum of 1:1 and 1:2 binding isotherms (where the final concentration of the GroEL-GroES complex is a sum of the [GroEL14(GroES7)] and [GroEL14(GroES7)2]). It was found that under such conditions the solution contains approximately 46 and 547 of the [GroEL14(GroES7)] and [GroEL14(GroES7)2] complexes, respectively. This result is consistent with previous studies that suggested that the ability of GroES to inhibit GroEL ATPase activity at low [KCl] was due to a significantly decreased apparent affinity of the 1:1 binary GroEL-GroES complex for MgATP versus MgADP under these conditions (10Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the presence of AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, mainly 1:1 complexes were formed (Fig. 1 A, closed circles). Analysis of these data in terms of 1:1 and 1:2 binding isotherms, as above, led to the conclusion that approximately 187 of the complexes were 1:2 in the presence of AMP-PNP. These conclusions are consistent with the previously reported electron microscopic studies showing that although 1:1 complexes were favored under these conditions, 1:2 complexes could be observed (31Lorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similar data obtained in the presence of ADP did not give a clear plateau at high GroES concentrations, and they were analyzed by the Scatchard equation (Equation 3; see 舠Materials and Methods舡). The resulting plot is presented in Fig. 1 B. Here, the solid line represents the theoretical fit of Equation 3 to the experimental data using a nonlinear least squares procedure (舠Materials and Methods舡). By utilizing the Scatchard equation one can determine the total concentration of the ligand binding sites and apparent binding constant. Here the equation describing a protein with two binding sites was used. The two component fit gave, for the tighter binding site, an apparent stoichiometry of the GroEL-GroES complex ([bound GroES7]/[total GroEL14]) of 0.61, because 122 nm GroES7 were found to be bound to 200 nm GroEL14. The corresponding apparent binding constant of the GroEL-GroES interaction was calculated as 20 nm. This is consistent with the previously reported ability of GroEL to form 1:1 GroEL14(GroES7) complexes in the presence of ADP (11Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The fitting procedure yielded parameters for the weaker binding site. Thus, for the the 200 nmsolution of GroEL14, the oligomer is able to bind, additionally, 231 nm GroES7 ([bound GroES7 to the second site]/[total GroEL14] = 1.155) with corresponding binding constant of 0.555 ॖm. Therefore, the total number of binding sites is 353 nm, which is approximately 1.7 times larger than initial [GroEL14], demonstrating the ability of the system to form 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2complexes even in the presence of ADP. The curvature in the Scatchard plot also supports the idea of the existence of two different binding sites on GroEL for GroES, because the system starts with equivalent sites as demonstrated in the x-ray structure (6Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). The low value of the second binding constant is a result of a strong negative cooperativity between two binding sites of GroEL, which was demonstrated by fitting the same data to the Hill equation (Equation 4; see 舠Materials and Methods舡). The Hill coefficient was found to be 0.58. For this system that starts with two equivalent binding sites at the ends of the cylindrical oligomer of GroEL (27Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1977: 217Google Scholar), the fact that the value of the Hill coefficient is <1 is consistent with strong negative cooperativity. Fig. 2 shows the inhibition of the GroEL ATPase by GroES. As has been previously shown, the hydrolysis of ATP by GroEL is K+-dependent (10Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,28Viitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 26: 5665-5671Crossref Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In the presence of 10 mm KCl, the maximum inhibition by GroES is approximately 507 (Fig. 2, closed squares). In the presence of low [K+], the ATPase activity is inhibited approximately 907 (Fig. 2, closed circles). These values are consistent with those previously reported (9Gray T.E. Fersht A.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 10Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Under conditions of high [GroEL] and low [KCl], the ATPase activity of GroEL is sharply decreased as a function of [GroES] (Fig. 2,closed circles), reaching a minimum close to [GroES]/GroEL] = 1. At this point, the GroEL activity is inhibited by approximately 807. It is interesting that the GroEL ATPase activity could not be inhibited 1007 at the low [KCl] and [GroES]/GroEL] = 1, demonstrating a low intrinsic ability to hydrolyze ATP by the trans GroEL toroid. The ATPase activity of GroEL does not change significantly at higher GroES/GroEL ratios. This is consistent with the previous suggestion that there is an increased relative affinity of GroEL for ADP compared with ATP (10Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, the rate of ADP exchange for ATP is the rate-limiting step for the formation of the 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2 complex and for ATP hydrolysis. Under these conditions, the exchange does not depend on the initial concentration of GroES. As shown above, under initial rate conditions for the hydrolysis of ATP, where [ATP] is greater than [ADP] and at low [KCl], GroEL is able to form a 1:2 complex with GroES (Fig. 1 A). The ability of the chaperonin to slowly hydrolyze ATP at low [KCl] and [GroES]/[GroEL] > 1 would facilitate GroES exchange under such conditions. Because low [AMP-PNP] alone cannot facilitate formation of the GroEL14(GroES7)2 complex (31Lorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the hypothesis that the 1:2 GroEL-GroES complex contains an asymmetric distribution of nucleotides was tested. In this experiment, AMP-PNP was titrated into a solution containing 1:1 GroEL14(GroES7) complex preformed in the presence of ADP and 5-fold excess of GroES. In the presence of GroES, ADP was shown to have high affinity for GroEL (K½ < 70 nm (30Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar)). Therefore, in the 160 ॖmsolution of the nucleotide all ADP binding sites are saturated. The KCl concentration was 0.5 mm to maintain ADP bound to the GroEL-GroES complex, because it was shown that under such conditions ADP remains bound to GroEL even in the presence of 2 mm of AMP-PNP (11Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). As a result, there was an additional increase of ther obs indicating an increased concentration of the bound GroES (Fig. 3). A similar result was obtained when pyrene-labeled GroES was titrated into a fixed concentration of GroEL in the presence of ADP (0.05 mm), after which each sample was supplied with 1 mm AMP-PNP (Fig. 4). The resulting anisotropy value increased, indicating the appearance of the additional binding sites for the GroEL-GroES interaction. Data replotted as a function of the concentration of bound GroES versus total concentration of GroES added shows that after AMP-PNP addition, two GroES7molecules were able to interact with one oligomer of GroEL (Fig. 4). A similar conclusion follows from studies in which ADP was added to an 1:1 GroEL14(GroES7) complex formed in the presence of AMP-PNP (data not shown).Figure 4Addition of AMP-PNP to the solution of 1:1 GroEL14(GroES7) complex results in the increase of the concentration of bound GroES. GroES was titrated up to 1000 nm (total final concentration) in the samples containing 160 nm GroEL14 and 0.1 mm ADP. The anisotropy of pyrene-GroES was measured as described under 舠Material and Methods舡 (shown as closed squares). AMP-PNP was added to maintain a final concentration of 1 mm. After careful mixing anisotropy was detected again (shown as open squares). Concentration of the bound GroES was calculated using Equations 1 and 2 (see 舠Materials and Methods舡). Measurements were made in buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm KCl. The lines are drawn to guide the eye.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is tempting to suggest, based on the highly symmetrical structure of GroEL, that the oligomer can form a GroEL14(GroES7)2 complex where the cochaperonin GroES is bound symmetrically on the opposite rings of the GroEL molecule. Indeed, using electron microscopy, cross-linking, and other methods it has been shown that under certain conditions GroEL is able to bind two GroES oligomers forming the 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2 complex (17Saibil H. Ellis R.J. The Chaperonins. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 245-266Crossref Google Scholar, 32Azem A. Diamant S. Kessel M. Weiss C. Goloubinoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16180-16186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To clarify the mechanism of the chaperone activity, it is important to understand the nature of nucleotides bound on the GroEL14(GroES7)2 complex. In this report, we have shown by directly measuring the binding of GroES to GroEL that GroEL14(GroES7)2 complexes are formed under conditions of productive chaperonin-assisted protein folding, i.e. in the presence of ATP and high [KCl], supporting the conclusions of Azem et al. (32Azem A. Diamant S. Kessel M. Weiss C. Goloubinoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12021-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and Toroket al. (33Torok Z. Vigh L. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16180-16186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The present method does not require cross-linking or fixation, and the state of GroES binding can be assessed in real time. GroEL14(GroES7)2 complexes can be formed also in the presence of ATP and low [KCl] (Fig.1 A). But because the affinity of GroEL for ADP relative to the affinity for ATP under such conditions is increased, concentrations of the 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2 complex are reduced (Fig. 1 A). Our results suggest that the 1:2 complex is not favored when only one type of nucleotide is bound to the GroEL double toroid. In fact, they suggest that only when ADP and ATP (or the ATP analog, AMP-PNP) are bound on the opposite rings of GroEL can significant amounts of 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2 complex be formed under the physiological ratio of GroEL and GroES (1:2) (Figs. 3 and 4). These considerations only refer to stable complexes, and they do not preclude the possibility of transient 1:2 complexes forming in the presence of a single type of nucleotide. For example, binding affinities of the two binding sites of GroEL in the presence of ADP are different by approximately 27-fold (Fig. 1 B). Because the affinity of the 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex for the second GroES oligomer under such conditions is highly reduced due to the strong negative cooperativity between two binding sites, the 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2 complex, containing the same type of nucleotide bound on the opposite rings of GroEL, is highly unstable. Therefore, one of the bound GroES molecules can be exchanged with GroES in bulk solution. This exchange is slow, and it can be facilitated in the presence of the excess of [GroES] over [GroEL] (34Hayer-Hartl M.K. Weber F. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Many models feature the folding of proteins inside the GroEL cavity, underneath a GroES 舠cap,舡 the so-called 舠Anfinsen cage舡 (35Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 36Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1994; 78 (x): 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 37Mayhew M. da Silva A.C.R. Martin J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). One of the questions that arises from such models concerns the fate of complexes where unfolded polypeptide is boundtrans from the GroES. There have been models proposed that feature multiple cycles of binding and release of substrate protein, such as the iterative annealing models (38Lilie H. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8100-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 39Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Thirumalai D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that conformational changes involved in the GroEL ring containing bound GroES could cause dissociation of the polypeptide on thetrans ring. However, if the 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2 complex is the functional chaperonin machine as suggested by these results along with others (32Azem A. Diamant S. Kessel M. Weiss C. Goloubinoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12021-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Torok Z. Vigh L. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16180-16186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 40Corrales F.J. Fersht A.R. Folding Design. 1996; 1: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), then productive folding would naturally proceed from a cis complex, i.e. substrate protein and GroES bound to the same GroEL ring (41Burston S.G. Weissman S. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This hypothesis does not imply that 1:1 GroEL-GroES complexes are insignificant in the chaperonin cycle. In fact, it can be easily imagined that the 1:1 complex is the acceptor state for unfolded polypeptide. Some productive folding could then be accomplished by competition between binding of the polypeptide and binding of the second GroES. This latter possibility would be appropriate, for example, with large proteins that could not be accommodated under the GroES cap (see below). The following general mechanism for chaperonin-assisted folding can be suggested (Scheme FS1). For simplicity, the scheme does not depict conformational changes in GroEL that occur in response to ligand binding and ATP hydrolysis. The acceptor state (1), the 1:1 GroEL-GroES complex, can interact with unfolded polypeptide. As a result, protein-substrate is bound on GroEL trans to the GroES oligomer ring (2). The succeeding binding of a second GroES molecule results in formation of 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2 complex (3) that contains bound unfolded polypeptide under a cap formed by the GroES. The following step of ATP hydrolysis results in liberation of the unfolded polypeptide, allowing it to fold inside of the cavity of GroEL. As a result of hydrolysis, a metastable, transient 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2 complex containing ADP bound on both rings of GroEL is formed (shown in brackets) (4). The GroES that is bound on the ring opposite to the side of ATP hydrolysis can dissociate under these conditions (10Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Dissociation of the GroES oligomer produces a complex with substrate protein under a GroES cap (5). The opposite side is in an acceptor state that, under the appropriate conditions (e.g. high concentrations of a slow folding protein), might bind a second molecule of substrate protein. After the opposite side rebinds ATP, it can also interact with a second GroES oligomer to form a state that is symmetric with respect to the stoichiometry of bound proteins but that is asymmetric with respect to bound nucleotides and detailed protein conformation (6). Repetition of the steps described above would then result in formation of a similar unstable complex (7). Because at this time ATP is hydrolyzed on the GroEL ring opposite to the position of the originally unfolded polypeptide, dissociation of the GroES molecule from the GroEL oligomer can result in complete liberation of the protein-substrate, if it was able to successfully fold during previous steps of the chaperonin action (8Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilly K. Woolford C. Hendrix R.W. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12414-12419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein substrate will rebind to the GroEL oligomer, and it will be able to enter the next cycle if its folding was not completed. This proposed mechanism can explain why some proteins can be refolded in the presence of ADP and GroES only, because the unstable 1:2 GroEL14(GroES7)2 complex (4 or 7) can be formed in the presence of this nucleotide. In the presence of ATP, cycling through the chaperonin cycle would be greatly facilitated (34Hayer-Hartl M.K. Weber F. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this general scheme all interactions with ligands and proteins are actually equilibria, and this full scheme is most appropriate for small proteins that can fit under the GroES cap and that are folded under nonpermissive conditions. When these conditions are not met, the scheme can be appropriately modified. Thus, for example, a large, fast folding protein may be assisted by a process involving the equilibrium between species1 and 2. The nucleotide hydrolysis provides the directionality and sequencing of interactions (12Gorovits B.M. Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6842-6845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The conclusions presented here in terms of nucleotide-dependent binding of GroES are compatible with studies of nucleotide binding to GroEL, in which it was suggested that negative cooperativity with respect to nucleotide binding favored asymmetric GroEL nucleotide complexes in which different nucleotides were bound on the two rings (42Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).

The enzyme l-5,6-dihydroorotase amidohydrolase (DHOase 1The abbreviations used are: DHOase, dihydroorotase; NTCB, 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); TNB2−, 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate dianion; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ; E.C. 3.5.2.3) catalyzes the key reaction of formation ofl-dihydroorotate, the first cyclic intermediate in thede novo pathway of pyrimidine biosynthesis (1Carrey E.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 899-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although DHOase is ubiquitous, distinct properties feature the prokaryotic enzymes from the eukaryotic ones, indicating an evolution of this class of enzymes in two different groups (2Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Rinker Jr., A.G. Zimmermann B.H. Scully J.L. Kim H. Evans D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Unlike most of the higher eukaryotic DHOases, the bacterial and yeast enzymes are monofunctional proteins. The DHOase-encoding gene from Escherichia coli has been cloned and overexpressed (3Brown D.C. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5917-5919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E. coli DHOase is a homodimer of 348 amino acids/ subunit as deduced from the cDNA sequence (4Bäckström D. Sjöberg R.-M. Lundberg L.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 5Wilson H.R. Chan P.T. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3051-3058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit binds tightly one zinc atom, which has been suggested to be directly involved in catalysis, because its presence is required for the enzyme to be functional. In addition to this catalytic zinc, two other zinc atoms may bind weakly to each subunit. Lost during purification, they can be reincorporated by dialysis of the one zinc/subunit dihydroorotase against ZnCl2. They are called structural zincs because they are nonessential for activity but stabilize the enzyme against air oxidation (6Washabaugh M.W. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5920-5929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of Co(II) for the active site Zn(II) resulted in an active Co-DHOase. Its electronic absorption spectrum exhibited a broad charge transfer band that was attributed to a thiolate ligand (7Brown D.C. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1597-1604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the six cysteines of each E. coli subunit, two are readily accessible to sulfhydryl reagents. The properties of the resulting cysteine-modified enzyme indicated that these two cysteines might be potential ligands to the structural Zn(II) in external protein sites. We report here on the localization of these two reactive cysteines along the peptide chain of the DHOase subunit by selective chemical cleavage at the N-peptide bonds of cyanylated cysteine residues and electrospray-ionizing mass spectrometry analyses of the produced peptide fragments. 2-Nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid (NTCB) is known to be an efficient reagent for selective cyanylation of cysteine residues in protein under mild conditions (8Degani Y. Patchornik A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). NTCB is of great value for protein primary structure investigation compared with other cysteine reagents, because it has been shown that cyanylated polypeptides undergo an intramolecular cleavage at the amino peptide bond adjacent to the SCN-cysteinyl residue upon incubation under slightly alkaline conditions (Scheme FS1) (9Stark G.R.

Other chemicals and reagents were obtained from commercial sources at the highest level of purity available. All buffers were prepared with ultrapure water (Bioblock) and degassed before use. E. coli DHOase was purified to homogeneity as described previously from an overproducing strain (RLM 569) that overexpresses the pyrC gene cloned in plasmid PKC16 (6Washabaugh M.W. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5920-5929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified DHOase contained one equivalent of zinc/subunit. Activity was routinely assayed using the UV determination of DHO at 230 nm (ε230 = 1170m−1 cm−1) (10Sander E.G. Wright L.D. McCormick D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3628-3630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the biosynthetic conversion of CA to DHO as well as in the degradative pathway of DHO into CA as reported previously (11Daniel R. Kokel B. Caminade E. Martel A. Le Goffic F. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad dye binding method with bovine serum albumin as the standard (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and referred to concentrations of subunits (i.e. active sites). The cysteine derivatization reaction was performed at 30 °C in 0.1 mTris phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 200 ॖm DTNB or NTCB and was initiated by the addition of DHOase (7.7–12.9 ॖm). For the determination of total cysteine, DHOase was incubated with 6 m guanidine HCl. The reaction was monitored until completion by following the change in absorbance at 412 nm due to the release of the dianion TNB2−, and its extent was determined from the final absorbance (ε412 = 14,100m−1 cm−1) (13Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). After reaction with NTCB, the S-cyanylated DHOase was cleaved by increasing the pH of the reaction mixture to 9.5 with 1 n NaOH followed by incubation at 37 °C for 17 h. Aliquots were removed during the cleavage reaction for analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Gel filtration was performed by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superose 12 column (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) eluted with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and calibrated with a kit of marker proteins (Pharmacia; 12–700 kDa). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS (SDS-PAGE) was performed on 12.57 polyacrylamide gel according to the method of Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using a vertical slab electrophoresis unit (model Mini-Protean II, Bio-Rad). Proteins were blotted by electrotransfer (1 h, 100 V) from the gel to an Immobilon P membrane (Whatman) as described by Towbin et al. (15Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) using a Mini Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad). After transfer, the membranes were rinsed with ultrapure water, rapidly saturated with 1007 methanol, and stained for 1 min with a solution of 0.17 Amido Black, 17 acetic acid, and 407 methanol. The membranes were destained by several washes in ultrapure water, and after air drying, the blue bands were excised for subsequent N-terminal sequence determination. The blotted proteins were subjected to automated Edman degradation with an Applied Biosystems Procize 492 protein sequencer. The protein samples were made free of salts and buffers by an high performance liquid chromatography purification step on an Hypersil C4 column before mass spectrometric analyses. This high performance liquid chromatography procedure was also used to isolate the two fragments 29,000 and 25,000 from the rest of the cleavage mixture. An Applied Biosystems chromatographic apparatus equipped with a syringe pump and an UV detector was used. UV detection of the eluted material was done at 214 nm. The column was equilibrated with a mixture of water:acetonitrile:trifluoroacetic acid 95:5:0.05 (solvent A) and eluted with the mixture water:acetonitrile:trifluoroacetic acid 10:90:0.045 (solvent B), using the following gradient program: 07 B, 2 min; 0–407 B, 4 min; 40–707 B, 10 min; 70–1007 B, 1 min; 1007 B, 1 min; 100 to 07 B, 1 min (flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1). Purified fractions were evaporated to dryness in a Speed Vac concentrator and redissolved in water:methanol 1:1. A Finnigan (San Jose, CA) TSQ-700 triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer provided with a Finnigan ESI/APCI ion source was used for molecular weight determination. The proteins were ionized by the electrospray method, and the instrument electrical potentials were set for positive ion detection. Mass spectrometry conditions were as follows: electrospray needle voltage, 4.5 kV; sheath gas pressure (nitrogen), 30 psi; electron multiplier voltage, 1200; dinode voltage, 15 kV; ion acquisition range, m/z 400 to m/z 2000. After acquisition, the molecular weight of the protein was obtained from the electrospray spectrum by using the deconvolution software provided by Finnigan. The molecular weights given in the text are the average values resulting from at least three analyses of each sample. Each spectrum shown is one of those corresponding to these analyses. The preparation of the purified DHOase used for mass spectrometric studies was analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration and SDS gel electrophoresis. The DHOase, eluted in one peak from the filtration column, had an apparent molecular weight of 77,700. The active fractions SDS-PAGE migrated on a 12.57 polyacrylamide gel as a single band of apparent molecular weight 38,600. These values were in agreement with previous work on native and cloned DHOase (6Washabaugh M.W. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5920-5929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Washabaugh M.W. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3293-3298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which showed the homodimeric structure of the E. coli DHOase. After SDS-PAGE, the band corresponding to the DHOase subunit was transferred to a nylon membrane, and its N-terminal sequence was determined. The first 12 amino acids were those deduced from the cDNA sequence (5Wilson H.R. Chan P.T. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3051-3058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the N-terminal methionine was not detected as reported for the native DHOase (16Washabaugh M.W. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3293-3298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the DHOase subunit was thus calculated from the amino acid composition deduced from the cDNA sequence starting from the N-terminal threonine (second residue of the cDNA sequence). The resulting calculated molecular weight of the 347-amino acid DHOase subunit was 38,696. Mass spectrometric analysis of the purified DHOase gave a molecular weight of 38,695 ± 1.5 (n = 6) (Fig. 1), in excellent agreement with the theoretical value. A very minor component of 38,728 was sometimes observed, which may correspond to the enzyme with a blocked N terminus, as reported previously by Brown and Collins (7Brown D.C. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1597-1604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During incubation of active DHOase with DTNB, 2 mol of dianion TNB2−/ subunit were released, indicating the oxidative modification of two cysteines among the six of the enzyme. All six cysteines were modified by DTNB when the incubation was carried out in 6 m guanidine HCl. Cyanylated cysteines rather than mixed disulfide are formed upon incubation with NTCB, but the extent of modification can be determined in the same way (i.e. through the quantitation of the released dianion TNB2−). As in the case of DTNB, two cysteines of the active DHOase were modified by NTCB (Fig.2). No cysteine is labeled by NTCB when the reaction is carried out on DHOase modified previously by DTNB andvice versa. Consequently, both reagents DTNB and NTCB react with the same two cysteines of the DHOase subunit. The mass spectrometric analyses of the NTCB-treated DHOase confirmed that two cysteines were cyanylated (Fig. 3). Indeed, an average molecular weight of 38,753 ± 5 (n = 6) was obtained for the cyanylated DHOase, in close agreement with the theoretical value of 38,746 expected for the enzyme with two covalently attached CN groups.Figure 3ESI mass spectrum of NTCB-treated E. coli dihydroorotase. This NTCB-treated dihydroorotase contained two CN groups (determined as in Fig. 2), in agreement with the mass increase of its peak represented in the deconvoluted spectrum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cleavage reaction was performed by adjusting the cyanylation reaction mixture to pH 9 and then incubating it at 37 °C for 17 h. SDS-PAGE analysis showed, besides the cyanylated DHOase, two new bands of lower molecular weight that increased in intensity during the first 10 hours of reaction (Fig. 4). Incubation at 37 °C for periods longer than 17 h did not increase the intensity of these bands. After 17 h of incubation, DHOase still was the major band, indicating a limited cleavage reaction as reported previously for other proteins (17Ogilvie J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 622: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The two new bands migrated at apparent molecular weights of 29,000 and 25,000. The N-terminal sequences of these two components as well as of the cyanylated DHOase were determined after electrotransfer of the protein bands. All of them had the same N-terminal sequence as the one obtained above for the native DHOase. This indicated that the two peptides ofM r 29,000 (peptide A) andM r 25,000 (peptide B) stemmed from the DHOase subunit and that they resulted from the removal of C-terminal fragments of approximately 8,000 and 13,000, respectively (according to the mechanism of the cleavage reaction shown on Scheme FS1, these two small fragments should have blocked N termini; this is confirmed by unsuccessful attempts to sequence the N terminus of the fragment 13,000. Purification and characterization of these two peptides are currently in process). Given the location of the six cysteines on the DHOase subunit polypeptide chain, few cleavage sites are possible. Concerning the peptide A, only a cleavage at one of the three cysteines arranged in a cluster at positions 263, 265, and 268 (SchemeFS2) could result in a peptide of this mass. Regarding peptide B, only a cleavage at cysteine 221 can give a fragment of this molecular weight. Consequently, cysteine 221 and one of the three cysteines 263, 265, or 268 should be the site of cyanylation by NTCB.Figure FS2Molecular weights of N-terminal fragments resulting from cleavages N-terminal to cysteines 268, 265, 263, and 221.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mass spectrum of the mixture of the two peptides A and B, separated previously from the noncleaved DHOase by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, exhibited as expected two components (Fig. 5). The first one had a molecular weight of 29,631 ± 5 (n = 9) and thus should correspond to peptide A. A molecular weight of 24,684 ± 3 (n = 9) was determined for the second peak, which was then attributed to peptide B. We assumed above that the latter resulted from the cleavage of DHOase at cysteine 221, generating a peptide of calculated M r 24,684. The molecular weight obtained by mass spectrometry for peptide B is thus in agreement with the calculated value. The results from mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing of peptide B indicate cysteine 221 as one of the two cysteines cyanylated by NTCB. We assumed above that a cleavage at one of the three cysteines 263, 265, or 268 generated peptide A, which contains cysteine 221. Because this cysteine 221 is cyanylated, the mass of one CN group has to be taken into account in the calculated molecular weight of the peptide A. The N-terminal peptide produced by a cleavage N-terminal to cysteine 265 and cyanylated at cysteine 221 has a calculated molecular weight of 29,605, which is very close to the value of 29,631 obtained by mass spectrometry. Actually, the difference (+26) between the two values fits exactly with the mass of one CN group, indicating that an extra cyanylation of the peptide occurs after the cleavage at cysteine 265. Cysteines 78 and 263 are the remaining potential sites for this additional cyanylation. A signal at a molecular weight of 29,488 could be seen in the mass spectrum (Fig. 5) close to the peak corresponding to peptide A. A cleavage of this peptide A at the position N-terminal to cysteine 263 yields a peptide of this range of molecular weight (Scheme FS2), suggesting that this residue 263 could be the site of the additional cyanylation. It is likely that cysteine 263 becomes more exposed to NTCB after cleavage N-terminal to the neighboring cysteine 265. Taking into account this additional cyanylation, the data from gel electrophoresis, N-terminal sequencing, and mass spectrometry indicate that, besides cysteine 221, cysteine 265 is the other primary site of cyanylation of E. coli DHOase under nondenaturing conditions. This paper reports the first study of E. colidihydroorotase by mass spectrometry. This powerful analytical method allowed an accurate determination of the molecular weight of the DHOase subunit, compared with the previous estimations by SDS-PAGE and sedimentation equilibrium analyses (16Washabaugh M.W. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3293-3298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DHOase subunit has a molecular weight of 38,696, i.e. the mass of the 347-amino acid peptide chain beginning from threonine 2 to C-terminal glutamine 348 on the sequence deduced from cDNA. This is in agreement with the N-terminal sequencing, which identifies threonine 2 as the N-terminal residue. Quantitative analyses indicated that the amount of sequenced N-terminal extremities was as high as expected from the concentration of the applied sample. Therefore, our DHOase preparation exhibited no blocked N terminus, indicating a complete removal of the N -(formyl)methionine. The mass spectrometry study of the modified DHOase confirms also that two cysteines among the six of the DHOase subunit are easily accessible to specific thiol reagents under nondenaturing conditions, suggesting exposed, external positions for these two residues (6Washabaugh M.W. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5920-5929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The features of the cleavage reaction induced by NTCB combined with mass spectrometric analysis provide an efficient method to locate cysteines on a polypeptide chain, as reported recently (18Wu J. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Applying this strategy to DHOase, we identified these two exposed thiol residues as cysteines 221 and 265. Cysteine is the most common protein ligand for structural zinc (19Christianson D.W. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1991; 42: 281-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the difference of sensitivity between the one zinc/subunit and the three zincs/subunit DHOases toward air oxidation and thiol reagents (6Washabaugh M.W. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5920-5929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Brown D.C. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1597-1604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we assume that the two cysteines 221 and 265 targeted by DTNB and NTCB are ligands of the external (structural) zinc ion. As observed previously by Brown and Collins (7Brown D.C. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1597-1604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cysteine 265 belongs to a cluster of three cysteines (263, 265, and 268), which have the same spacing as three of the four cysteine ligands of one of the domains of metallothionein (20Christianson D.W. Alexander R.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 254: 12506-12512Google Scholar). Accordingly, cysteines 263 and 268 could be also considered as potential ligands of structural zinc. These two residues are not accessible to thiol reagents in native DHOase likely for steric hindrance because at least one of these is cyanylated upon cleavage reaction. Structural zinc atoms in proteins are often in outlying regions of the macromolecules, where they affect the local structure and conformation (21Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). Structural zincs are also involved in stabilization and protection of the protein against oxidation, likely by a very limited access to their protein binding domains (22Gibbs P.N.B. Jordan P.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1981; 9: 232-233Crossref Google Scholar). Washabaugh and Collins (6Washabaugh M.W. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5920-5929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the three zincs/subunit DHOase was protected against air oxidation as compared with the one zinc/subunit and that air oxidation was reversed by addition of dithioerythritol. Air-oxidized DHOase has a decreased specific activity and does not react with DTNB and NTCB. As a consequence, the two cysteines 221 and 265, which are targeted by the thiol reagents, are also the sites of the oxidative modification. These authors suggested that cysteines of air-oxidized DHOase were oxidized to either a sulfenic acid or a disulfide. We did mass spectrometry analysis of air-oxidized DHOase and obtained a molecular weight of 38,694, almost identical to the molecular weight of the native DHOase (data not shown). This result favors the hypothesis of formation of a disulfide bond. To check the effect of the modification of the two cysteines 221 and 265 on the overall structure of the DHOase subunit, we are performing studies by gel filtration and circular dichroism that will be published later. It is worthwhile to note our preliminary results, which show that DTNB- or NTCB-modified DHOase is eluted on gel filtration columns under nondenaturing conditions as a dimer and partially as a monomer. No monomer is observed for the native DHOase, which is eluted as a single peak of dimer (Fig. 6). Therefore, modification of the two cysteines disrupts the conformation of the DHOase subunit in such a way that formation of the dimer is partially impeded. The partial formation of the monomer parallels the limited cleavage induced by NTCB. It seems from literature data that the proteins retain the SCN groups without cleavage, so long as the native structure is retained (9Stark G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The SCN group must be oriented appropriately for nucleophilic attack, and such an orientation may be constrained by the native protein structure. Then the hypothesis could be raised that the monomer fraction is the same fraction cleaved upon incubation at alkaline pH. Finally, cysteines 221 and 265 are the two thiol residues modified by DTNB and NTCB, and it is likely that these two cysteines as well as potentially cysteines 263 and 268 are ligands of the structural zinc atoms. The latter stabilize DHOase through protection of these thiol residues against air oxidation and contribution to protein conformation to yield the active dimer. Concerning the catalytic zinc, previous studies on Co(II)-substituted E. coli DHOase implicated a thiol group as a ligand at the active site (7Brown D.C. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1597-1604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two remaining cysteines not targeted in this study were cysteines 78 and 295. The former is located on the primary sequence between the most conserved protein segment, which contains the histidine residues 16 and 18 and the region containing histidine 139. These three conserved histidines have been recently shown to be ligands of the catalytic zinc at the active site of mammalian DHOase by site-directed mutagenesis (23Williams N.K. Manthey M.K.
