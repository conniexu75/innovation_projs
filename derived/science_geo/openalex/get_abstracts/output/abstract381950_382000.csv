https://openalex.org/W2093281361,"Differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts is controlled by extracellular cues. Canonical Wnt signaling is particularly important for maintenance of bone mass in humans. Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, mediated by microRNAs, plays an essential role in the control of osteoblast differentiation. Here, we find that miR-29a is necessary for human osteoblast differentiation, and miR-29a is increased during differentiation in the mesenchymal precursor cell line hFOB1.19 and in primary cultures of human osteoblasts. Furthermore, the promoter of the expressed sequence tag containing the human miR-29a gene is induced by canonical Wnt signaling. This effect is mediated, at least in part, by two T-cell factor/LEF-binding sites within the proximal promoter. Furthermore, we show that the negative regulators of Wnt signaling, Dikkopf-1 (Dkk1), Kremen2, and secreted frizzled related protein 2 (sFRP2), are direct targets of miR-29a. Endogenous protein levels for these Wnt antagonists are increased in cells transfected with synthetic miR-29a inhibitor. In contrast, transfection with miR-29a mimic decreases expression of these antagonists and potentiates Wnt signaling. Overall, we demonstrate that miR-29 and Wnt signaling are involved in a regulatory circuit that can modulate osteoblast differentiation. Specifically, canonical Wnt signaling induces miR-29a transcription. The subsequent down-regulation of key Wnt signaling antagonists, Dkk1, Kremen2, and sFRP2, by miR-29a potentiates Wnt signaling, contributing to a gene expression program important for osteoblast differentiation. This novel regulatory circuit provides additional insight into how microRNAs interact with signaling molecules during osteoblast differentiation, allowing for fine-tuning of intricate cellular processes.

https://openalex.org/W2044217893,"Acute lung injury is characterized by injury to the lung epithelium that leads to impaired resolution of pulmonary edema and also facilitates accumulation of protein-rich edema fluid and inflammatory cells in the distal airspaces of the lung. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) may have therapeutic value for the treatment of acute lung injury. Here we tested the ability of human allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells to restore epithelial permeability to protein across primary cultures of polarized human alveolar epithelial type II cells after an inflammatory insult. Alveolar epithelial type II cells were grown on a Transwell plate with an air-liquid interface and injured by cytomix, a combination of IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and IFNgamma. Protein permeability measured by (131)I-labeled albumin flux was increased by 5-fold over 24 h after cytokine-induced injury. Co-culture of human MSC restored type II cell epithelial permeability to protein to control levels. Using siRNA knockdown of potential paracrine soluble factors, we found that angiopoietin-1 secretion was responsible for this beneficial effect in part by preventing actin stress fiber formation and claudin 18 disorganization through suppression of NFkappaB activity. This study provides novel evidence for a beneficial effect of MSC on alveolar epithelial permeability to protein."
https://openalex.org/W1993576110,"Normal brain development and function depends on microRNA (miRNA) networks to fine tune the balance between the transcriptome and proteome of the cell. These small non-coding RNA regulators are highly enriched in brain where they play key roles in neuronal development, plasticity and disease. In neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), brain miRNA profiles are altered; thus miRNA dysfunction could be both a cause and a consequence of disease. Our study dissects the complexity of human AD pathology, and addresses the hypothesis that amyloid-beta (Abeta) itself, a known causative factor of AD, causes neuronal miRNA deregulation, which could contribute to the pathomechanisms of AD. We used sensitive TaqMan low density miRNA arrays (TLDA) on murine primary hippocampal cultures to show that about half of all miRNAs tested were down-regulated in response to Abeta peptides. Time-course assays of neuronal Abeta treatments show that Abeta is in fact a powerful regulator of miRNA levels as the response of certain mature miRNAs is extremely rapid. Bioinformatic analysis predicts that the deregulated miRNAs are likely to affect target genes present in prominent neuronal pathways known to be disrupted in AD. Remarkably, we also found that the miRNA deregulation in hippocampal cultures was paralleled in vivo by a deregulation in the hippocampus of Abeta42-depositing APP23 mice, at the onset of Abeta plaque formation. In addition, the miRNA deregulation in hippocampal cultures and APP23 hippocampus overlaps with those obtained in human AD studies. Taken together, our findings suggest that neuronal miRNA deregulation in response to an insult by Abeta may be an important factor contributing to the cascade of events leading to AD."
https://openalex.org/W2076253751,"Background Knowledge of the entire protein content, the proteome, of normal human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) would enable insights into neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Until now technologic hurdles and access to true normal samples hindered attaining this goal. Methods and Principal Findings We applied immunoaffinity separation and high sensitivity and resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to examine CSF from healthy normal individuals. 2630 proteins in CSF from normal subjects were identified, of which 56% were CSF-specific, not found in the much larger set of 3654 proteins we have identified in plasma. We also examined CSF from groups of subjects previously examined by others as surrogates for normals where neurologic symptoms warranted a lumbar puncture but where clinical laboratory were reported as normal. We found statistically significant differences between their CSF proteins and our non-neurological normals. We also examined CSF from 10 volunteer subjects who had lumbar punctures at least 4 weeks apart and found that there was little variability in CSF proteins in an individual as compared to subject to subject. Conclusions Our results represent the most comprehensive characterization of true normal CSF to date. This normal CSF proteome establishes a comparative standard and basis for investigations into a variety of diseases with neurological and psychiatric features."
https://openalex.org/W2157450464,"The identification of pathologic TDP-43 aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, followed by the discovery of dominantly inherited point mutations in TDP-43 in familial ALS, have been critical insights into the mechanism of these untreatable neurodegenerative diseases. However, the biochemical basis of TDP-43 aggregation and the mechanism of how mutations in TDP-43 lead to disease remain enigmatic. In efforts to understand how TDP-43 alters its cellular localization in response to proteotoxic stress, we found that TDP-43 is sequestered into polyglutamine aggregates. Furthermore, we found that binding to polyglutamine aggregates requires a previously uncharacterized glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich region in the C-terminal domain of TDP-43. Sequestration into polyglutamine aggregates causes TDP-43 to be cleared from the nucleus and become detergent-insoluble. Finally, we observed that sequestration into polyglutamine aggregates led to loss of TDP-43-mediated splicing in the nucleus and that polyglutamine toxicity could be partially rescued by increasing expression of TDP-43. These data indicate pathologic sequestration into polyglutamine aggregates, and loss of nuclear TDP-43 function may play an unexpected role in polyglutamine disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, as Q/N domains have a strong tendency to self-aggregate and in some cases can function as prions, the identification of a Q/N domain in TDP-43 has important implications for the mechanism of pathologic aggregation of TDP-43 in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2155397502,"Exotoxins, including the hemolysins known as the alpha (alpha) and beta (beta) toxins, play an important role in the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus infections. A random transposon library was screened for S. aureus mutants exhibiting altered hemolysin expression compared to wild type. Transposon insertions in 72 genes resulting in increased or decreased hemolysin expression were identified. Mutations inactivating a putative cyclic di-GMP synthetase and a serine/threonine phosphatase (Stp1) were found to reduce hemolysin expression, and mutations in genes encoding a two component regulator PhoR, LysR family transcriptional regulator, purine biosynthetic enzymes and a serine/threonine kinase (Stk1) increased expression. Transcription of the hla gene encoding alpha toxin was decreased in a Deltastp1 mutant strain and increased in a Deltastk1 strain. Microarray analysis of a Deltastk1 mutant revealed increased transcription of additional exotoxins. A Deltastp1 strain is severely attenuated for virulence in mice and elicits less inflammation and IL-6 production than the Deltastk1 strain. In vivo phosphopeptide enrichment and mass spectrometric analysis revealed that threonine phosphorylated peptides corresponding to Stk1, DNA binding histone like protein (HU), serine-aspartate rich fibrinogen/bone sialoprotein binding protein (SdrE) and a hypothetical protein (NWMN_1123) were present in the wild type and not in the Deltastk1 mutant. Collectively, these studies suggest that Stk1 mediated phosphorylation of HU, SrdE and NWMN_1123 affects S. aureus gene expression and virulence."
https://openalex.org/W1978041309,"The MEK5/Erk5 MAPK cascade has recently been implicated in the regulation of endothelial integrity and represents a candidate pathway mediating the beneficial effects of laminar flow, a major factor preventing vascular dysfunction and disease. Here we expressed a constitutively active mutant of MEK5 (MEK5D) to study the transcriptional and functional responses to Erk5 activation in human primary endothelial cells. We provide evidence that constitutive Erk5 activation elicits an overall protective phenotype characterized by increased apoptosis resistance and a decreased angiogenic, migratory, and inflammatory potential. This is supported by bioinformatic microarray analysis, which uncovered a statistical overrepresentation of corresponding functional clusters as well as a significant induction of anti-thrombotic, hemostatic, and vasodilatory genes. We identify KLF4 as a novel Erk5 target and demonstrate a critical role of this transcription factor downstream of Erk5. We show that KLF4 expression largely reproduces the protective phenotype in endothelial cells, whereas KLF4 siRNA suppresses expression of various Erk5 targets. Additionally, we show that vasoprotective statins potently induce KLF4 and KLF4-dependent gene expression via activation of Erk5. Our data underscore a major protective function of the MEK5/Erk5/KLF4 module in ECs and implicate agonistic Erk5 activation as potential strategy for treatment of vascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2049778580,"In Synthetic Biology, de novo synthesis of GC-rich constructs poses a major challenge because of secondary structure formation and mispriming. While there are many web-based tools for codon optimizing difficult regions, no method currently exists that allows for potentially phenotypically important sequence conservation. Therefore, to overcome these limitations in researching GC-rich genes and their non-coding elements, we explored the use of DMSO and betaine in two conventional methods of assembly and amplification. For this study, we compared the polymerase (PCA) and ligase-based (LCR) methods for construction of two GC-rich gene fragments implicated in tumorigenesis, IGF2R and BRAF. Though we found no benefit in employing either DMSO or betaine during the assembly steps, both additives greatly improved target product specificity and yield during PCR amplification. Of the methods tested, LCR assembly proved far superior to PCA, generating a much more stable template to amplify from. We further report that DMSO and betaine are highly compatible with all other reaction components of gene synthesis and do not require any additional protocol modifications. Furthermore, we believe either additive will allow for the production of a wide variety of GC-rich gene constructs without the need for expensive and time-consuming sample extraction and purification prior to downstream application."
https://openalex.org/W2112115708,"Thapsigargin (Tg), a specific inhibitor of sarco/endoplasmic Ca2+-ATPases (SERCA), binds with high affinity to the E2 conformation of these ATPases. SERCA inhibition leads to elevated calcium levels in the cytoplasm, which in turn induces apoptosis. We present x-ray crystallographic and intrinsic fluorescence data to show how Tg and chemical analogs of the compound with modified or removed side chains bind to isolated SERCA 1a membranes. This occurs by uptake via the membrane lipid followed by insertion into a resident intramembranous binding site with few adaptative changes. Our binding data indicate that a balanced hydrophobicity and accurate positioning of the side chains, provided by the central guaianolide ring structure, defines a pharmacophore of Tg that governs both high affinity and access to the protein-binding site. Tg analogs substituted with long linkers at O-8 extend from the binding site between transmembrane segments to the putative N-terminal Ca2+ entry pathway. The long chain analogs provide a rational basis for the localization of the linker, the presence of which is necessary for enabling prostate-specific antigen to cleave peptide-conjugated prodrugs targeting SERCA of cancer cells (Denmeade, S. R., Jakobsen, C. M., Janssen, S., Khan, S. R., Garrett, E. S., Lilja, H., Christensen, S. B., and Isaacs, J. T. (2003) J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 95, 990–1000). Our study demonstrates the usefulness of a simple in vitro system to test and direct development toward the formulation of new Tg derivatives with improved properties for SERCA targeting. Finally, we propose that the Tg binding pocket may be a regulatory site that, for example, is sensitive to cholesterol.

https://openalex.org/W1995203150,"Erythropoietin (EPO), a hematopoietic cytokine, enhances neurogenesis and angiogenesis during stroke recovery. In the present study, we examined the effect of EPO on oligodendrogenesis in a rat model of embolic focal cerebral ischemia.Recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) at a dose of 5,000 U/kg (n = 18) or saline (n = 18) was intraperitoneally administered daily for 7 days starting 24 h after stroke onset. Treatment with rhEPO augmented actively proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) measured by NG2 immunoreactive cells within the peri-infarct white matter and the subventricular zone (SVZ), but did not protect against loss of myelinating oligodendrocytes measured by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CNPase) positive cells 7 days after stroke. However, 28 and 42 days after stroke, treatment with rhEPO significantly increased myelinating oligodendrocytes and myelinated axons within the peri-infarct white matter. Using lentivirus to label subventricular zone (SVZ) neural progenitor cells, we found that in addition to the OPCs generated in the peri-infarct white matter, SVZ neural progenitor cells contributed to rhEPO-increased OPCs in the peri-infarct area. Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for birth-dating cells, we demonstrated that myelinating oligodendrocytes observed 28 days after stroke were derived from OPCs. Furthermore, rhEPO significantly improved neurological outcome 6 weeks after stroke. In vitro, rhEPO increased differentiation of adult SVZ neural progenitor cells into oligodendrocytes and enhanced immature oligodendrocyte cell proliferation.Our in vivo and in vitro data indicate that EPO amplifies stroke-induced oligodendrogenesis that could facilitate axonal re-myelination and lead to functional recovery after stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2042815830,"Background Various patterns of HIV-1 disease progression are described in clinical practice and in research. There is a need to assess the specificity of commonly used definitions of long term non-progressor (LTNP) elite controllers (LTNP-EC), viremic controllers (LTNP-VC), and viremic non controllers (LTNP-NC), as well as of chronic progressors (P) and rapid progressors (RP). Methodology and Principal Findings We re-evaluated the HIV-1 clinical definitions, summarized in Table 1, using the information provided by a selected number of host genetic markers and viral factors. There is a continuous decrease of protective factors and an accumulation of risk factors from LTNP-EC to RP. Statistical differences in frequency of protective HLA-B alleles (p-0.01), HLA-C rs9264942 (p-0.06), and protective CCR5/CCR2 haplotypes (p-0.02) across groups, and the presence of viruses with an ancestral genotype in the “viral dating” (i.e., nucleotide sequences with low viral divergence from the most recent common ancestor) support the differences among principal clinical groups of HIV-1 infected individuals. Conclusions A combination of host genetic and viral factors supports current clinical definitions that discriminate among patterns of HIV-1 progression. The study also emphasizes the need to apply a standardized and accepted set of clinical definitions for the purpose of disease stratification and research."
https://openalex.org/W2073592394,"Numerous researchers have posited that there should be a strong negative relationship between the evolutionary distance among species and their ecological similarity. Alternative evidence suggests that members of adaptive radiations should display no relationship between divergence time and ecological similarity because rapid evolution results in near-simultaneous speciation early in the clade's history. In this paper, we performed the first investigation of ecological diversity in a phylogenetic context using a mammalian adaptive radiation, the Malagasy primates.We collected data for 43 extant species including: 1) 1064 species by locality samples, 2) GIS climate data for each sampling locality, and 3) the phylogenetic relationships of the species. We calculated the niche space of each species by summarizing the climatic variation at localities of known occurrence. Climate data from all species occurrences at all sites were entered into a principal components analysis. We calculated the mean value of the first two PCA axes, representing rainfall and temperature diversity, for each species. We calculated the K statistic using the Physig program for Matlab to examine how well the climatic niche space of species was correlated with phylogeny.We found that there was little relationship between the phylogenetic distance of Malagasy primates and their rainfall and temperature niche space, i.e., closely related species tend to occupy different climatic niches. Furthermore, several species from different genera converged on a similar climatic niche. These results have important implications for the evolution of ecological diversity, and the long-term survival of these endangered species."
https://openalex.org/W2007289968,"Ribosomal proteins play an important role in p53 activation in response to nucleolar stress. Multiple ribosomal proteins, including L5, L11, L23, and S7, have been shown to bind to and inhibit MDM2, leading to p53 activation. However, it is not clear whether ribosomal protein regulation of MDM2 is specific to some, but not all ribosomal proteins. Here we show that L29 and L30, two ribosomal proteins from the 60 S ribosomal subunit, do not bind to MDM2 and do not inhibit MDM2-mediated p53 suppression, indicating that the ribosomal protein regulation of the MDM2-p53 feedback loop is specific. Interestingly, direct perturbation of the 60 S ribosomal biogenesis by knocking down either L29 or L30 drastically induced the level and activity of p53, leading to p53-depedent cell cycle arrest. This p53 activation was drastically inhibited by knockdown of L11 or L5. Consistently, knockdown of L29 or L30 enhanced the interaction of MDM2 with L11 and L5 and markedly inhibited MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, suggesting that direct perturbation of 60 S ribosomal biogenesis activates p53 via L11- and L5-mediated MDM2 suppression. Mechanistically, knockdown of L30 or L29 significantly increased the NEDDylation and nuclear retention of L11. Knocking down endogenous NEDD8 suppressed p53 activation induced by knockdown of L30. These results demonstrate that NEDDylation of L11 plays a critical role in mediating p53 activation in response to perturbation of ribosomal biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1974597332,"Radiotherapy is widely used to treat cancer. While rapidly dividing cancer cells are naturally considered the main target of radiotherapy, emerging evidence indicates that radiotherapy also affects endothelial cell functions, and possibly also their angiogenic capacity. In spite of its clinical relevance, such putative anti-angiogenic effect of radiotherapy has not been thoroughly characterized. We have investigated the effect of ionizing radiation on angiogenesis using in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro experimental models in combination with genetic and pharmacological interventions.Here we show that high doses ionizing radiation locally suppressed VEGF- and FGF-2-induced Matrigel plug angiogenesis in mice in vivo and prevented endothelial cell sprouting from mouse aortic rings following in vivo or ex vivo irradiation. Quiescent human endothelial cells exposed to ionizing radiation in vitro resisted apoptosis, demonstrated reduced sprouting, migration and proliferation capacities, showed enhanced adhesion to matrix proteins, and underwent premature senescence. Irradiation induced the expression of P53 and P21 proteins in endothelial cells, but p53 or p21 deficiency and P21 silencing did not prevent radiation-induced inhibition of sprouting or proliferation. Radiation induced Smad-2 phosphorylation in skin in vivo and in endothelial cells in vitro. Inhibition of the TGF-beta type I receptor ALK5 rescued deficient endothelial cell sprouting and migration but not proliferation in vitro and restored defective Matrigel plug angiogenesis in irradiated mice in vivo. ALK5 inhibition, however, did not rescue deficient proliferation. Notch signaling, known to hinder angiogenesis, was activated by radiation but its inhibition, alone or in combination with ALK5 inhibition, did not rescue suppressed proliferation.These results demonstrate that irradiation of quiescent endothelial cells suppresses subsequent angiogenesis and that ALK5 is a critical mediator of this suppression. These results extend our understanding of radiotherapy-induced endothelial dysfunctions, relevant to both therapeutic and unwanted effects of radiotherapy."

The overall effect of CDX2 in intestinal cells has previously been investigated in conditional knock-out mice, revealing a critical role of CDX2 in the formation of the normal intestinal identity. The identification of direct targets of transcription factors is a key problem in the study of gene regulatory networks. The ChIP-seq technique combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with next generation sequencing resulting in a high throughput experimental method of identifying direct targets of specific transcription factors. The method was applied to CDX2, leading to the identification of the direct binding of CDX2 to several known and novel target genes in the intestinal cell. Examination of the transcript levels of selected genes verified the regulatory role of CDX2 binding. The results place CDX2 as a key node in a transcription factor network controlling the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal cells."

Binding of the anti-Met monoclonal antibody DN30 to its epitope induces the proteolytic cleavage of Met, thereby impairing the invasive growth of tumors. The molecular mechanism controlling this therapeutic shedding process has so far been unknown. Here, we report that A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase (ADAM)-10, but not ADAM-17, is required for DN30-induced Met shedding. Knockdown of ADAM-10 in different tumor cell lines or abrogation of its proteolytic activity by natural or synthetic inhibitors abolished Met down-regulation on the cell surface as well as reduction of Met activation. Moreover, hepatocyte growth factor-induced tumor cell migration and invasion were impaired upon ADAM-10 knockdown.

Here we examine mechanisms regulating cellular processing of CDCP1. By analyzing cell lines exclusively passaged non-enzymatically and through use of a panel of protease inhibitors, we demonstrate that full-length 135 kDa CDCP1 is post-translationally processed in a range of cell lines by a mechanism involving serine protease activity, generating a C-terminal 70-kDa fragment. Immunopurification and N-terminal sequencing of this cell-retained fragment and detailed mutagenesis, show that proteolytic processing of CDCP1 occurs at two sites, Arg-368 and Lys-369. We show that the serine protease matriptase is an efficient, but not essential, cellular processor of CDCP1 at Arg-368. Importantly, we also demonstrate that proteolysis induces tyrosine phosphorylation of 70-kDa CDCP1 and recruitment of Src and PKCδ to this fragment. In addition, Western blot and mass spectroscopy analyses show that an N-terminal 65-kDa CDCP1 ectodomain is shed intact from the cell surface.

Recently, we demonstrated that the DNA replication and repair protein Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is required for replication of lagging strand telomeres. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that FEN1 is required for efficient re-initiation of stalled replication forks. At the telomere, we find that FEN1 depletion results in replicative stress as evidenced by fragile telomere expression and sister telomere loss. We show that FEN1 participation in Okazaki fragment processing is not required for efficient telomere replication. Instead we find that FEN1 gap endonuclease activity, which processes DNA structures resembling stalled replication forks, and the FEN1 interaction with the RecQ helicases are vital for telomere stability. Finally, we find that FEN1 depletion neither impacts cell cycle progression nor in vitro DNA replication through non-telomeric sequences. Our finding that FEN1 is required for efficient replication fork re-initiation strongly suggests that the fragile telomere expression and sister telomere losses observed upon FEN1 depletion are the direct result of replication fork collapse. Together, these findings suggest that other nucleases compensate for FEN1 loss throughout the genome during DNA replication but fail to do so at the telomere.

https://openalex.org/W2131625926,"Francisella tularensis is a highly infectious facultative intracellular bacterium that can be transmitted between mammals by arthropod vectors. Similar to many other intracellular bacteria that replicate within the cytosol, such as Listeria, Shigella, Burkholderia, and Rickettsia, the virulence of F. tularensis depends on its ability to modulate biogenesis of its phagosome and to escape into the host cell cytosol where it proliferates. Recent studies have identified the F. tularensis genes required for modulation of phagosome biogenesis and escape into the host cell cytosol within human and arthropod-derived cells. However, the arthropod and mammalian host factors required for intracellular proliferation of F. tularensis are not known. We have utilized a forward genetic approach employing genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila melanogaster-derived cells. Screening a library of approximately 21,300 RNAi, we have identified at least 186 host factors required for intracellular bacterial proliferation. We silenced twelve mammalian homologues by RNAi in HEK293T cells and identified three conserved factors, the PI4 kinase PI4KCA, the ubiquitin hydrolase USP22, and the ubiquitin ligase CDC27, which are also required for replication in human cells. The PI4KCA and USP22 mammalian factors are not required for modulation of phagosome biogenesis or phagosomal escape but are required for proliferation within the cytosol. In contrast, the CDC27 ubiquitin ligase is required for evading lysosomal fusion and for phagosomal escape into the cytosol. Although F. tularensis interacts with the autophagy pathway during late stages of proliferation in mouse macrophages, this does not occur in human cells. Our data suggest that F. tularensis utilizes host ubiquitin turnover in distinct mechanisms during the phagosomal and cytosolic phases and phosphoinositide metabolism is essential for cytosolic proliferation of F. tularensis. Our data will facilitate deciphering molecular ecology, patho-adaptation of F. tularensis to the arthropod vector and its role in bacterial ecology and patho-evolution to infect mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2013758127,"Background The mammary gland is responsible for the transfer of a tremendous amount of zinc (∼1–3 mg zinc/day) from maternal circulation into milk during lactation to support the growth and development of the offspring. When this process is compromised, severe zinc deficiency compromises neuronal development and immune function and increases infant morbidity and/or mortality. It remains unclear as to how the lactating mammary gland dynamically integrates zinc import from maternal circulation with the enormous amount of zinc that is secreted into milk. Methodology/Principal Findings Herein we utilized X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) which allowed for the visualization and quantification of the process of zinc transfer through the mammary gland of the lactating mouse. Our data illustrate that a large amount of zinc first accumulates in the mammary gland during lactation. Interestingly, this zinc is not cytosolic, but accumulated in large, discrete sub-cellular compartments. These zinc pools were then redistributed to small intracellular vesicles destined for secretion in a prolactin-responsive manner. Confocal microscopy identified mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus as the sub-cellular compartments which accumulate zinc; however, zinc pools in the Golgi apparatus, but not mitochondria are redistributed to vesicles destined for secretion during lactation. Conclusions/Significance Our data directly implicate the Golgi apparatus in providing a large, mobilizable zinc storage pool to assist in providing for the tremendous amount of zinc that is secreted into milk. Interestingly, our study also provides compelling evidence that mitochondrial zinc pools expand in the mammary gland during lactation which we speculate may play a role in regulating mammary gland function."

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18999-19004Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), provide compelling evidence supporting antiparallel orientation of the monomers. In addition, the sequence determinants of membrane topology, the arginine and lysine contents of EmrE loops (i.e. the K+R bias), do not favor a unique orientation in the membrane implying that EmrE could insert with dual topology (18Rapp M. Seppälä S. Granseth E. von Heijne G. Science. 2007; 315: 1282-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, experiments designed to verify or alter the relative orientation of the monomers were inconclusive (19McHaourab H.S. Mishra S. Koteiche H.A. Amadi S.H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7980-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).In contrast, a body of biochemical data supports a parallel orientation of the dimer. These include the design and construction of functional EmrE chimeras where monomers are linked by short polar loops not favored energetically to cross the bilayer (20Steiner-Mordoch S. Soskine M. Solomon D. Rotem D. Gold A. Yechieli M. Adam Y. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, residues predicted to be on opposite sides of the membrane in the antiparallel dimer model can be cross-linked without significant perturbation of transport (21Soskine M. Mark S. Tayer N. Mizrachi R. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36205-36212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Finally, limited structural constraints derived from EPR analysis of spin-labeled EmrE in TM3 were interpreted as consistent with a parallel orientation (19McHaourab H.S. Mishra S. Koteiche H.A. Amadi S.H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7980-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Contributing to the structure mechanism divide is the absence of direct analysis of the structure and conformational dynamics of EmrE in lipid bilayers in various transport intermediates. Specifically, the structural changes induced by substrate/proton binding have not been described as both available structures were obtained in the presence of the substrate tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+). In this study, we report results from a systematic analysis of EmrE structure in the (substrate-free) apo- and TPP+-bound conformations in liposomes. For this purpose, spin label probes were introduced one at a time along the EmrE sequence (residues 3–110). EPR spectroscopy was used to characterize spin label dynamics, accessibility to the lipid and water phases, as well as pairwise short range proximity across the dimer interface (22Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 23Mchaourab H.S. Kálai T. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L.

Changes in the EPR constraints upon substrate binding reveal movements in TM1 and -2 and ordering of TM3 and the adjacent loop linking it to TM4. The compatibility between the EPR constraints and existing structures and models is evaluated to assess whether an antiparallel dimer is populated in liposomes.DISCUSSIONAn alternating access model of vectorial transport by EmrE posits transitions between at least four intermediates. The cycle begins by binding of protons (substrate) to an outward (inward)-facing conformation and ends at either of the two putative apo intermediates. Although direct information regarding the conformational changes that mediate transition between these intermediates is lacking, most prevalent models invoke reorientation of the binding site to shuttle the protons and substrates between the two sides of the membrane (35Fleishman S.J. Harrington S.E. Enosh A. Halperin D. Tate C.G. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 38Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Structure of Apo EmrEGiven a pKa of around 8.0 for the two Glu-14 residues (12Soskine M. Adam Y. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9951-9955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the substrate-free (apo) intermediate investigated here corresponds to the protonated state. The EPR parameters provide constraints on the local environment, the orientation and tilt of the TM segments, and the packing of the two monomers in the dimer. TPP+-induced changes in these parameters reflect structural rearrangements induced by substrate binding.The accessibility data clearly delineates four helices as predicted by sequence analysis and verified by the EM and crystal structures (15Tate C.G. Kunji E.R. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Chen Y.J. Pornillos O. Lieu S. Ma C. Chen A.P. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18999-19004Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 39Edwards R.A. Turner R.J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 1998; 76: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Each of TM1–3 is directly packed against its counterpart in the dimer as deduced from dipolar coupling between spin labels in these segments. A recurrent theme in the corresponding EPR line shapes is their two-component nature reflecting at least two spin label populations only one of which is in close proximity. Because all these mutants have similar SEC profiles to the WT* with no evidence of dissociation, the second population is likely to reflect a different packing arrangement of the EmrE dimer. Remarkably, weak dipolar coupling observed in TM4 (residues 96 and 97) is not consistent with either its packing in the structures or its role as the dimerization helix of the antiparallel dimer. Although the EPR line shapes along TM4 reveal a peripheral location in direct contact with the lipid phase, the O2 accessibilities pattern suggests that TM4 is on average tilted relative to the membrane normal at a steeper angle compared with the TPP+-bound EmrE crystal structure.TPP+-bound EmrE IntermediateThe simplest interpretation of the changes in EPR parameters along TM1 would involve a kink in the helix near residue 14 allowing tighter packing of the turns N-terminal to the critical Glu-14 but reducing steric contacts C-terminal to this residue along the lines of an alternating access mechanism. This interpretation, however, does not exclude the possibility of more complex movements. For instance, the increased steric restrictions at residues 8 and 10 and the reduced dipolar coupling at residue 18 caused by TPP+ binding may reflect limited local helix rotation. The EPR data also suggest tilting of TM2 at its two highly dynamic N-terminal turns (residues 30–40), which are already in direct contact with the lipid bilayer. TPP+ binding changes the backbone structure of TM3 and the two adjacent loops. O2 accessibility changes along TM3 indicate ordering of the helical backbone in the TPP+-bound state (Fig. 5B). Finally, the loop linking TM3 and -4 becomes more lipid-exposed, a rearrangement likely to require a dynamic and flexible TM4.Comparison of the EPR Parameters with the Structure of the TPP+-bound EmrEAs noted above, there are multiple EmrE regions where the EPR parameters of the apo intermediate deviate from the expected environments in the crystal structure (17Chen Y.J. Pornillos O. Lieu S. Ma C. Chen A.P. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18999-19004Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and a model based on the EM structure (35Fleishman S.J. Harrington S.E. Enosh A. Halperin D. Tate C.G. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These deviations may reflect the conformational changes upon TPP+ binding or arise from differences between the structure in liposomes and in the crystal.Overall, the spectral broadening at sites in TM1 and -2 can be reconciled with the packing geometry of these segments in the crystal structure. Although the buried environments of these sites hinder a quantitative comparison, we evaluated whether the pattern of proximity agrees with the pairwise packing of helices in the crystal structure by modeling the spin label in cones that project along the Cα–Cβ bond (40Alexander N. Bortolus M. Al-Mestarihi A. Mchaourab H. Meiler J. Structure. 2008; 16: 181-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). At residue 14 in TM1, the spin labels are expected to directly point toward each other thus rationalizing the broadened population. The projection of the side chains at residue 18 is in agreement with the absence of dipolar coupling in the TPP+-bound state (Fig. 6A). Thus, the observed spectral broadening at this residue in the apo intermediate reveals structural changes in the C-terminal region of TM1 reducing the separation between the spin labels and increasing spin label mobility at residues 19, 21, and 22.Residues 41 and 44 in TM2 are within the range of dipolar coupling, although at residue 40 one of the labels is predicted to project away from the interface (Fig. 6B). Therefore, comparison of the EPR data in the apo state with the TPP+-bound structure suggests structural changes in this part of TM2. A tilting motion away from the interface following TPP+ binding, predicted by the accessibility data, would reduce dipolar coupling at 40 as is experimentally observed.Mapping the accessibility parameters onto the crystal structure provides a local perspective on the correspondence between the crystal structure and the EPR data (Fig. 7). In general, the O2 accessibility profile along TM1 and -2 is in reasonable agreement with the disposition of the two helices in the structure. Although the comparison is complicated by the structural asymmetry between the two monomers (see Fig. 7), residues with large exposure to O2 map to the lipid-facing surfaces of TM1 and -2. Because the EPR parameters represent an average from the two spin labels, deviations from the crystal structures are not unexpected.The most pronounced disagreements between the EPR constraints and the crystal structure are in TM3 and -4. Previously, dipolar coupling along TM3 (residues 60 and 75) was interpreted as indicative of parallel packing of the two TM3s at the dimer interface (19McHaourab H.S. Mishra S. Koteiche H.A. Amadi S.H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7980-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). With the finding that spin labels at residue 64 have strong dipolar coupling, the data could be brought into closer agreement with an antiparallel model if the N terminus of TM3 is located well below the membrane/water interface, placing residues 60 and 64 in close proximity. We note, however, that the strong dipolar coupling predicted by the crystal structure at residue 63 was not observed experimentally. The proximities at residues 60 and 64 are not consistent with the EM-based model (35Fleishman S.J. Harrington S.E. Enosh A. Halperin D. Tate C.G. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) where the N terminus of TM3 is located at opposite end of the bilayer.Moreover, there are striking discrepancies in the orientation of the TM3 C terminus relative to the lipid phase. Residues of maximum O2 accessibility (e.g. residue 74) are buried in the crystal structure, and residues of minimal O2 accessibility are lipid-facing (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). Although NiEDDA accessibility is observed in the 75–80-residue loop (Fig. 7B), relatively high O2 accessibility in this region also suggests exposure to the hydrocarbon phase of the bilayer. Concurrent accessibility to O2 and NiEDDA can only be rationalized by a highly dynamic backbone allowing large amplitude excursion of the loop between the aqueous and lipid phases.As noted by Fleishman et al. (35Fleishman S.J. Harrington S.E. Enosh A. Halperin D. Tate C.G. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), TM3 contains sequences, including a GXG motif (residues 65–67), that are likely to impart a degree of flexibility and account for a kink in the EM-based model. The lack of continuous periodicity in the O2 accessibility may reflect a break in the helix that allows a dynamic C-terminal region to bend back toward the bilayer without perturbation of the tight packing at the N terminus. The EPR data along the loop connecting TM3 and -4 hints at large amplitude motion resulting in simultaneous accessibility to the bilayer and aqueous phases (Fig. 8). An ensemble of conformations in this region may have an average EPR accessibility that deviates from the unique conformation trapped in the crystal.FIGURE 8Model of TM3 based on the EPR data (yellow) superimposed on a ribbon representation of the helix in the crystal structure. It assumes a 2-fold symmetry axis near the middle of the bilayer. This configuration satisfies the constraints of proximity between residues 60 and 64. The arrows indicate movement of the C-terminal tail that allows residues at the C terminus and in the loop linking TM3 to -4 to sample the membrane and aqueous environments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although confirming that TM4 is in direct contact with the lipid bilayers, the EPR data imply a substantial tilt of its axis relative to the bilayer normal. The decrease in the values at successive maxima and the loss of helical periodicity indicate that after residue 103 the helix does not undergo stable tertiary contacts. This latter result is not inconsistent with the TPP+-bound crystal structure where the segments following residues 99 and 104 in each monomer are not resolved. The concomitant increase in NiEDDA accessibility at this turn suggests that this part of the helix is emerging out of the membrane (Fig. 7B).Concluding RemarksHow does the EPR data weigh in on the dual topology controversy? As noted above, we find substantial deviations between the average liposome conformation and the x-ray and EM structures. Furthermore, the persistence of second populations in the dipolar-coupled spectra reveals conformations of EmrE with different packing interfaces. Nevertheless, the pattern of proximity along TM1 and -2 suggests that one EmrE conformation is similar to the TPP+-bound crystal structure. Flexibility and dynamics are invoked to rationalize the discrepancy between the EPR data along TM3 and its crystallographic conformation. The comparison is complicated by the low resolution of the latter, which at 4 Å implies that residue assignment can be off by as much as a full helical turn. While noting this agreement, the definite test of the veracity of the crystal structure as a model of the antiparallel dimer requires verification of the helical packing in the monomer as well as long range distance measurements in the dimer (41Borbat P.P. Surendhran K. Bortolus M. Zou P. Freed J.H. McHaourab H.S. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: 2211-2219Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These experiments are currently in progress.Vectorial transport by EmrE requires a re-orientation of the binding site from inward- to outward-facing. The structural changes that underlie the switch in accessibility have not been described experimentally, but a model has been proposed on the basis of the available structures of TPP+-bound EmrE (35Fleishman S.J. Harrington S.E. Enosh A. Halperin D. Tate C.G. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Starting from the asymmetric dimer, changes in substrate-binding site exposure require a simple interchange of the conformation of the two monomers. Consequently, the inward- and outward-facing conformations are linked by 180° rotation around the in-plane axis of symmetry. This conceptualization of alternating access implies no net change in residue environment, accessibility, or proximity across the dimer interface during the transition. Consequently, it does not predict changes in the EPR parameters as these are not affected by the symmetric exchange of spin label environments.The results presented here demonstrate that transition from the apo- to the TPP+-bound intermediate does not follow the putative symmetric interchange described above. When mapped onto the crystal structure, the segments reporting changes in the EPR parameters appear to be distributed on both sides of the asymmetric dimer tracing a pathway through which the substrate may permeate. Specifically, the tilt at the N terminus of TM2 provides direct access to the bilayer from which hydrophobic substrates may partition. A detailed global model of this conformational transition will also benefit from long range distance measurements (42Zou P. Bortolus M. McHaourab H.S. J. Mol.

In addition, the sequence determinants of membrane topology, the arginine and lysine contents of EmrE loops (i.e. the K+R bias), do not favor a unique orientation in the membrane implying that EmrE could insert with dual topology (18Rapp M. Seppälä S. Granseth E. von Heijne G. Science. 2007; 315: 1282-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, experiments designed to verify or alter the relative orientation of the monomers were inconclusive (19McHaourab H.S. Mishra S. Koteiche H.A. Amadi S.H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7980-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).In contrast, a body of biochemical data supports a parallel orientation of the dimer. These include the design and construction of functional EmrE chimeras where monomers are linked by short polar loops not favored energetically to cross the bilayer (20Steiner-Mordoch S. Soskine M.

https://openalex.org/W2019406647,"Bmi-1, the first functionally identified polycomb gene family member, plays critical roles in cell cycle regulation, cell immortalization, and cell senescence. Bmi-1 is involved in the development and progression of carcinomas and is a potent target for cancer therapy. One important pathway regulated by Bmi-1 is that involving two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p16Ink4a and p19Arf, as Bmi-1 represses the INK4a locus on which they are encoded. A close correlation between the up-regulation of Bmi-1 and down-regulation of p16 has been demonstrated in various tumors; however, how Bmi-1 regulates p16 expression is not clear. In this study, we revealed that Bmi-1 regulates the expression of p16 by binding directly to the Bmi-1-responding element (BRE) within the p16 promoter. The BRE resided at bp −821 to −732 upstream of the p16 ATG codon. BRE alone was sufficient to allow Bmi-1-mediated regulation of the CMV promoter. Bmi-1 typically functions by forming a complex with Ring2; however, regulation of p16 was independent of Ring2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing of Bmi-1-precipitated chromatin DNA revealed that 1536 genes were targeted by Bmi-1, including genes involved in tissue-specific differentiation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. By analyzing the binding sequences of these genes, we found two highly conserved Bmi-1-binding motifs, which were required for Bmi-1-mediated p16 promoter regulation. Taken together, our results revealed the molecular mechanism of Bmi-1-mediated regulation of the p16 gene, thus providing further insights into the functions of Bmi-1 as well as a sensitive high-throughput platform with which to screen Bmi-1-targeted small molecules for cancer therapy.

Bmi-1 was first isolated as an oncogene that cooperated with c-Myc in the generation of lymphomas in mice (3Haupt Y. Alexander W.S. Barri G. Klinken S.P. Adams J.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 753-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Previous reports have shown that Bmi-1 is associated with the initiation and progression of various types of tumor-initiating cells and plays important roles in the development and progression of carcinomas (4Douglas D.

Increasing evidence in the literature supports the clinical significance of Bmi-1 in the development of carcinomas; thus, Bmi-1 can be used as a valuable marker for the assessment and prognosis of different cancers (7Wiederschain D.

Consistent with its roles in the development of carcinoma, numerous studies have demonstrated that Bmi-1 plays vital roles in the self-renewal and differentiation of normal and cancer stem cells through multiple pathways. Bmi-1-deficient mice died by the time they reached early adulthood and displayed growth retardation, signs of hematopoietic failure, and neurological abnormalities (15van der Lugt N.M. Domen J. Linders K. van Roon M. Robanus-Maandag E. te Riele H. van der Valk M. Deschamps J. Sofroniew M. van Lohuizen M. et al.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 757-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Bmi-1 was required for the postnatal maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and neural stem cells (16Lessard J. Sauvageau G. Nature. 2003; 423: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar, 17Molofsky A.V. Pardal R. Iwashita T. Park I.K. Clarke M.F. Morrison S.J.

Nature. 2003; 423: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). The proliferation of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in a mouse model of AML was also promoted by Bmi-1 (16Lessard J. Sauvageau G. Nature. 2003; 423: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Bmi-1-expressing LSCs were able to induce leukemia when transplanted into irradiated mice, whereas Bmi-1−/− LSCs had only limited proliferative potential and were unable to induce disease (16Lessard J. Sauvageau G. Nature. 2003; 423: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). As an important regulator in tumorigenesis and proliferation of normal and cancer stem cells, Bmi-1 is a potent target candidate in cancer stem cells for cancer therapy. However, a sensitive high-throughput system with which to monitor Bmi-1 activity has not yet been established. One important pathway in which Bmi-1 acts to promote the overall growth of mice and cellular proliferation includes Cdkn2a; Bmi-1 represses the expression of Cdkn2a, which encodes two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p16Ink4a (p16) and p19Arf (p19, also known as p14 in humans) (9Cui H.

Down-regulation of p16 and p19 by Bmi-1 facilitates cells to bypass senescence and become immortalized (19Jacobs J.J. Kieboom K. Marino S. DePinho R.A. van Lohuizen M. Nature. 1999; 397: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that Bmi-1 might act on cancer cells in part by blocking p16-mediated pathways. Frequent mutations and deletions of the p16 protein were often seen in human cancer cell lines and malignant tumors (12Vonlanthen S. Heighway J. Altermatt H.J. Gugger M. Kappeler A. Borner M.M. van Lohuizen M. Betticher D.C. Br J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 1372-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Tumors with moderate or strong Bmi-1 expression were more likely to have low levels of p16 (12Vonlanthen S. Heighway J. Altermatt H.J. Gugger M. Kappeler A. Borner M.M. van Lohuizen M. Betticher D.C. Br J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 1372-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). A close correlation between the up-regulation of Bmi-1 and down-regulation of p16 has been demonstrated in lung cancer and neuroblastoma tumors (9Cui H. Hu B. Li T. Ma J. Alam G. Gunning W.T. Ding H.F. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 1370-1378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); however, the precise mechanism by which Bmi-1 regulates p16 expression remains unclear. In this study, using a luciferase reporter system, we found that Bmi-1 regulated the expression of p16 by binding directly with the Bmi-1-responding element (BRE) 4The abbreviations used are: BREBmi-1-responding elementPRCpolycomb repressive complexAMLacute myeloid leukemiaHSChematopoietic stem cellCSCcancer stem cellCMVcytomegalovirusRDregulatory domain. within the p16 promoter. The BRE localized to base pairs (bp) −821 to −732 upstream of the p16 ATG codon, which was sufficient to enable Bmi-1-mediated regulation of the CMV promoter. Although Bmi-1 normally forms a complex with Ring2, in the case of p16 regulation, Bmi-1 is Ring2-independent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing of Bmi-1-precipitated chromatin DNA revealed that many genes were targeted by Bmi-1, including genes involved in tissue-specific differentiation, cell cycle and apoptosis. By analyzing the binding sequences of these genes, we found two highly conserved Bmi-1-binding motifs, which were required for Bmi-1-mediated regulation of the p16 promoter.

The promoter-less Luciferase reporter vector, N3-MCS-Luc, was constructed on the basis of pEGFP-N3 (Clontech). The CMV promoter and the EGFP region of the pEGFP-N3 were mutated and removed, and the original MCS fragment was substituted by a newly synthesized fragment: GCTAGCGGATCCGAATTCGGTACCCTGCAGCTCGAGGAAAGCTTGGCATTCGGTACTGTTGGTAAAGCCACCATGGGAAGATCTGCGGCCGCGTCGACTCGGCCGCGACTCTAGA. Then luciferase gene was amplified and cloned into the vector using the BglII and SalI sites, thus resulted the synthesis of the N3-MCS-Luc reporter vector (primer in supplemental Table S8). The 1.2K p16 promoter that spanned from nucleotide +1 to nucleotide −1214 upstream of the starting codon ATG was amplified from HeLa genome and cloned into the luciferase reporter vector The resulting plasmid, termed p1214, was used as a template for PCR generation of progressively deleted fragments of p16 promoter. These promoter truncations spanned from nucleotide +1 to −1036 (p1036), +1 to −860 (p860), +1 to −650 (p650), +1 to −500 (p500), +1 to −450 (p450), +1 to −343 (p343), and +1 to −247 (p247). These truncations were also subcloned into the luciferase reporter vector (primers in supplemental Table S8). For down-regulation of Bmi-1 and Ring2, there different sets of fragments targeting Bmi-1 or Ring2 were constructed into pll3.7. For knockdown of Bmi-1 and Ring2, vectors expressing the following hairpin RNAs were transfected into 293T cells with other package plasmids, supernatant were collected after 48 h and added to HeLa cells that were of 40% confluence. Samples were collected after 48 h. The three RNAi target Bmi-1 are as follows: BRNAi1, 5′-ATATTGTATACAAATTAG; BRNAi2, 5′-AAGGAATGGTCCACTTCCATT; BRNAi3, 5′-ATGAAGAGAAGAAGGGATT (27Cui H. Ma J. Ding J.

The deletion mutants of the Bmi-1 ΔRF and ΔHT were generated by overlapping PCR, and cloned into pCDNA3.1-Flag vector with BamHI and XhoI sites (primer in supplemental Table S8). Deletion mutants of BRE region, M1-BREr, which lack the CCCTTGC region and M2-BREr, which lack the GGGAAGGGGAGGGGAAGGAGAGAG region were generated by overlapping PCR and cloned into CMV-MCS-Luc vector with NheI and BamHI sites (primer in supplemental Table S8). HeLa and MCF7 cells was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For transfection, the cells were plated in 12-well-plate at about 70% confluence and transfected with the plasmids using Polyfect (Qiagene) as the instruction described. P16 promoter luciferase assays were performed with the luciferase assay system (Promega). Thirty-six hours after transfection, HeLa cell and MCF7 cells were extracted with the use of a lysis buffer, a 30-μl aliquot was used for luminescence measurements with 50 μl of substrate. These experiments were carried out in triplicate, and all experiments were performed twice for confirmation. After being resolved on 6–15% SDS-PAGE gels, the protein samples were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol) for 20 min at 30 V. The NC membrane was then blocked in TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.3% Tween-20) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h under room temperature and blotted for 1 h with antibody at 37 °C: Bmi-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology 1:5000), Ring2 (Upstate Signaling 1:2000), and tubulin (Upstate Signaling 1:5000). The NC membrane was washed and blocked for 1 h in TTBS containing 5% nonfat milk at room temperature. The NC membrane was then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Sigma 1:1000) at 37 °C. After the final wash in TTBS, the membrane was developed for visualization by enhance chemiluminescence (Sigma) and x-ray film. The ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was used according to the supplier's instructions. Approximately 1 × 106 HeLa or MCF7 cells were used per assay. Briefly, cells were cross-linked by adding formaldehyde (270 μl of 37% formaldehyde/10 ml) and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min. Then, chromatin was sonicated to an average size of about 300 bp and immunoprecipitated with antibody: Bmi-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Ring2 (Upstate Signaling), and actin (Upstate Signaling). Histone-DNA cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and then used for Q-PCR. For ChIP sequencing, 1–10 ng of ChIP DNA were end-repaired and 5′-phosphorylated using ENDIt DNA End-Repair kit (Epicenter). A single adenine was added to the 3′-end by Klenow (3′-5′ exo−), and double-stranded Illumina Adapters were ligated to the ends of the ChIP fragments. Adapter-ligated ChIP DNA fragments between 275 and 700 bp were gel-purified and subjected to 18 cycles of PCR. The prepared DNA library was used directly for cluster generation and sequencing analysis using the Illumina Genome Analyzer (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The image files generated by the sequencer were then processed to produce digital-quality data. After masking of adaptor sequences and removal of contaminated reads, clean reads were processed for computational analysis. DNA was generated from Bmi-1 immunoprecipitation, and quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara) according to the provided manual (primer in supplemental Table S8). ABI PRISM 7300 system was used under normal amplification conditions for 40 cycles. Assays were performed in triplicate. According to the results of ChIP-Seq, we collected those sequences both at the vicinity of peak summit position (100 bp) and in the 2000-bp upstream region of any gene transcription start site. 84 sequences were chosen and subjected to MEME software with the following parameters: motif width, 8, distribution of motifs, oops, minimum number of sites for each motif, 30. After MEME estimation, those potential motifs were manual curated, and some less conserved and simple tandem repeated motifs were discarded. Then the candidates were tried mapping to the promoter of p16. To investigate how Bmi-1 regulates the expression of the p16 gene, we cloned the p16 promoter, a ∼1.2-kb genomic sequence upstream of the p16 ATG initiation codon (31Hara E. Smith R. Parry D. Tahara H. Stone S. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), designated p1214, into a promoterless luciferase reporter vector. Because p16 is expressed highly in HeLa cells, but is not expressed in MCF7 cells (Fig. 1, A and B), we use these two cell lines as the positive and negative controls with which to examine the activity of p1214. The results showed that p1214 displayed greater activity in HeLa rather than MCF7 cells (Fig. 1C), consistent with the expression patterns of the endogenous p16 gene in these cells. We then examined whether the activity of p1214 could be regulated by Bmi-1. For overexpression of Bmi-1, HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-Bmi-1; for knockdown of Bmi-1, MCF7 cells were infected with pLL3.7-Bmi-1-Si-expressing virus (supplemental Fig. S1). The results showed that p1214 activity decreased about 30% upon Bmi-1 overexpression and increased about 30% when Bmi-1 was knocked down, and overexpression or knockdown of Bmi-1 had no such effect on CMV promoter activity (Fig. 1, D and E). The above results indicated that the activity of the p16 promoter, p1214, could be regulated by the Bmi-1 protein and that p1214 contains the BRE; thus, p1214 can be used to study the mechanism by which Bmi-1 regulates p16 expression. To define the BRE sequence required for Bmi-1-mediated inhibition of p1214, a series of truncated p16 promoters was constructed (Fig. 2A) and then co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-Bmi-1 into HeLa cells or with pLL3.7-Bmi-1-Si into MCF7 cells. The results showed that overexpression and knockdown of Bmi-1 both greatly affected the activities of p1214, p1036, and p860, but had little effect on the activities of p650 and the shorter promoters (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that the −860 to −650 bp region (BRE-containing region, designated BREr) of the p16 promoter contains a BRE that is required for Bmi-1-mediated regulation. For further confirmation, we inserted this region upstream of the CMV promoter, which is not regulated by Bmi-1, to examine whether the activity of the resulting BREr-CMV was regulated by Bmi-1. The results showed that the activity of BREr-CMV decreased upon overexpression of Bmi-1 and increased when Bmi-1 was knocked down; the extent of inhibition and activation was similar to that observed in p1214 experiments (Fig. 2D). These results showed that the p16 promoter BREr was sufficient for Bmi-1-mediated regulation. To identify the Bmi-1-responding element more precisely, the BREr was divided into two fragments, F1 and F2, and each was inserted upstream of the CMV promoter (Fig. 2F). The results showed that the activity of F1-CMV, but not F2-CMV, was regulated by Bmi-1, indicating that the Bmi-1-responding element resided in the F1 fragment (Fig. 2, G and H). The F1 fragment was then subdivided into three smaller fragments, A, B, and C. Fragments A, B, or C or fragment combinations AB, AC, or BC was each inserted upstream of the CMV promoter (Fig. 2F), and the Bmi-1-responding activities of these six constructs were measured. The results showed that only fragment BC (bp −821 to −732) allowed CMV to be regulated by Bmi-1, and the regulation level was almost the same as that of the F1-CMV and the BREr-CMV (Fig. 2, G and H). The above results indicated that bps −821 to −732 of the p16 promoter contained the Bmi-1 responding element, which is necessary and sufficient for Bmi-1-mediated regulation of p16. We next explored whether Bmi-1 regulated p16 expression by binding specifically to the BRE region of the p16 promoter. For ChIP analysis, five sets of primers were designed, and each pair amplified a ∼200-bp amplicon covering −1214 bp to −250 bp of the genomic p16 promoter region. The amplicons were designated F1, F2, BREr, F3, and F4 (Fig. 3A). Bmi-1-overexpressing HeLa cells were used for ChIP assays with anti-Bmi-1 antibody, and the precipitated chromatin was analyzed by real-time PCR using p16 promoter-specific primers. The results showed that BREr was much more abundant than the other amplicons, and little amplification of the p16 promoter was observed in the nonspecific antibody-precipitated DNA (Fig. 3B). ChIP assays using MCF7 cell lines provided the same result (Fig. 4D). These results showed that Bmi-1 could bind specifically with the BREr of the p16 promoter.FIGURE 4Ring2 is not dependent on Bmi-1 for regulation of p16. A, HeLa cells were transfected separately with Bmi-1wt, Bmi-1ΔHT, or Bmi-1ΔRF. ChIPs were then performed using anti-Bmi-1 antibody. The precipitated complex was analyzed by Western blot using anti-Bmi-1 or anti-Ring2 antibodies. B–D, MCF7 cells or Bmi-1 overexpressed HeLa cells were collected for ChIP using anti-Bmi-1 or anti-Ring2 antibody, and anti-actin antibody was used as a control. The precipitated chromatin was analyzed by PCR with p16 and Hox-B5 promoter-specific primers for gel visualization (B), and by real-time PCR using p16 promoter-specific primers (C and D). Results showed that Ring2 was not able to bind with the BREr of the p16 promoter. E and F, p1214-Luc or BREr-CMV-Luc were transfected into HeLa cells together with an overexpression vector containing Bmi-1, Ring2, or Bmi-1 plus Ring2 separately (E) or transfected into MCF7 cells that had been infected with Bmi-1-Si or different Ring2-Si-containing viruses (F). Luciferase activities were then measured 48 h after transfection. Results showed that neither overexpression nor knockdown of Ring2 affected the activity of p1214 or BREr-CMV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Bmi-1 has two important domains, the NH2-terminal Ring-Finger (RF) domain and the COOH-terminal HTHT (HT) domain. Previous studies have demonstrated that both RF and HT domains were required for the activation of hTERT transcription and immortalization of epithelial cells (10Dimri G.P. Martinez J.L. Jacobs J.J. Keblusek P. Itahana K. Van Lohuizen M. Campisi J. Wazer D.E. Band V. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4736-4745PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion analysis showed that the RF and HT domains of Bmi-1 were required for life span extension and suppression of p16, and a RF deletion mutant exhibited dominant negative activity and induced p16 expression and premature senescence (10Dimri G.P. Martinez J.L. Jacobs J.J. Keblusek P. Itahana K. Van Lohuizen M. Campisi J. Wazer D.E. Band V. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4736-4745PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the role of these two domains in the regulation of p16, we constructed two Bmi-1 deletion mutants lacking either the RF domain (ΔRF) or the HTHT domain (ΔHT). When over-expressed in HeLa cells, these two mutants had little effect on the activity of the p16 promoter, including p1214 and BREr-CMV (Fig. 3, C and D). The inability of these two mutants to inhibit p16 promoter activity might be due to a loss of their ability to bind the BRE region of the p16 promoter. To test this possibility, ChIP assays using anti-Bmi-1 antibody were performed in HeLa cells overexpressing the ΔRF or the ΔHT mutant. The results showed that little amplification of the p16 promoter was observed in ΔRF or ΔHT mutant-precipitated DNA (Fig. 3, E and F). These results indicate that the RF and HT domains are both necessary for Bmi-1 to bind the p16 promoter BRE and to regulate p16 expression. Ring2 is another essential protein in the polycomb repression complex 1 (PRC1) and the main co-binding protein of Bmi-1. Bmi-1 represses the expression of numerous genes essential for genomic programming and development in the form of PRC1 (32Cao R. Tsukada Y. Zhang Y. Mol.

In multivariate regression analysis, f-calprotectin correlated negatively with ante and per natal antibiotic treatment (p = 0.001), and correlated positively with the volume of enteral feeding (mL/kg/d) (p = 0.009), the need to interrupt enteral feeding (p = 0.001), and prominent gastrointestinal colonization by Clostridium sp (p = 0.019) and Staphylococcus sp (p = 0.047).During the first weeks of life, the high f-calprotectin values observed in preterm infants could be linked to the gut bacterial establishment."
https://openalex.org/W1994677429,"Current HIV vaccine approaches are focused on immunogens encoding whole HIV antigenic proteins that mainly elicit cytotoxic CD8+ responses. Mounting evidence points toward a critical role for CD4+ T cells in the control of immunodeficiency virus replication, probably due to cognate help. Vaccine-induced CD4+ T cell responses might, therefore, have a protective effect in HIV replication. In addition, successful vaccines may have to elicit responses to multiple epitopes in a high proportion of vaccinees, to match the highly variable circulating strains of HIV. Using rational vaccine design, we developed a DNA vaccine encoding 18 algorithm-selected conserved, ""promiscuous"" (multiple HLA-DR-binding) B-subtype HIV CD4 epitopes - previously found to be frequently recognized by HIV-infected patients. We assessed the ability of the vaccine to induce broad T cell responses in the context of multiple HLA class II molecules using different strains of HLA class II- transgenic mice (-DR2, -DR4, -DQ6 and -DQ8). Mice displayed CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses of significant breadth and magnitude, and 16 out of the 18 encoded epitopes were recognized. By virtue of inducing broad responses against conserved CD4+ T cell epitopes that can be recognized in the context of widely diverse, common HLA class II alleles, this vaccine concept may cope both with HIV genetic variability and increased population coverage. The vaccine may thus be a source of cognate help for HIV-specific CD8+ T cells elicited by conventional immunogens, in a wide proportion of vaccinees."

The genes encoding different subtype neurotoxins of serotypes A, B, F and several dual neurotoxin-producing strains have been shown to reside on plasmids, suggesting that intra- and interspecies transfer of BoNT-encoding plasmids may occur. The objective of the present study was to determine whether these C. botulinum BoNT-encoding plasmids are conjugative.C. botulinum BoNT-encoding plasmids pBotCDC-A3 (strain CDC-A3), pCLJ (strain 657Ba) and pCLL (strain Eklund 17B) were tagged with the erythromycin resistance marker (Erm) using the ClosTron mutagenesis system by inserting a group II intron into the neurotoxin genes carried on these plasmids. Transfer of the tagged plasmids from the donor strains CDC-A3, 657Ba and Eklund 17B to tetracycline-resistant recipient C. botulinum strains was evaluated in mating experiments. Erythromycin and tetracycline resistant transconjugants were isolated from donor:recipient mating pairs tested. Transfer of the plasmids to the transconjugants was confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Southern hybridizations. Transfer required cell-to-cell contact and was DNase resistant. This indicates that transfer of these plasmids occurs via a conjugation mechanism.This is the first evidence supporting conjugal transfer of native botulinum neurotoxin-encoding plasmids in C. botulinum, and provides a probable mechanism for the lateral distribution of BoNT-encoding plasmids to other C. botulinum strains. The potential transfer of C. botulinum BoNT-encoding plasmids to other bacterial hosts in the environment or within the human intestine is of great concern for human pathogenicity and necessitates further characterization of these plasmids."
https://openalex.org/W1977718952,"The human peroxins PEX3 and PEX19 play a central role in peroxisomal membrane biogenesis. The membrane-anchored PEX3 serves as the receptor for cytosolic PEX19, which in turn recognizes newly synthesized peroxisomal membrane proteins. After delivering these proteins to the peroxisomal membrane, PEX19 is recycled to the cytosol. The molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are not well understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of the cytosolic domain of PEX3 in complex with a PEX19-derived peptide. PEX3 adopts a novel fold that is best described as a large helical bundle. A hydrophobic groove at the membrane-distal end of PEX3 engages the PEX19 peptide with nanomolar affinity. Mutagenesis experiments identify phenylalanine 29 in PEX19 as critical for this interaction. Because key PEX3 residues involved in complex formation are highly conserved across species, the observed binding mechanism is of general biological relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2009602163,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid whose functions are mediated by multiple G protein-coupled receptors. We have shown that osteoblasts produce LPA, raising the possibility that it mediates intercellular signaling among osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Here we investigated the expression, signaling and function of LPA receptors in osteoclasts. Focal application of LPA elicited transient increases in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), with 50% of osteoclasts responding at approximately 400 nm LPA. LPA-induced elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) was blocked by pertussis toxin or the LPA(1/3) receptor antagonist VPC-32183. LPA caused sustained retraction of osteoclast lamellipodia and disrupted peripheral actin belts. Retraction was insensitive to VPC-32183 or pertussis toxin, indicating involvement of a distinct signaling pathway. In this regard, inhibition of Rho-associated kinase stimulated respreading after LPA-induced retraction. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed transcripts encoding LPA(1) and to a lesser extent LPA(2), LPA(4), and LPA(5) receptor subtypes. LPA induced nuclear translocation of NFATc1 and enhanced osteoclast survival, effects that were blocked by VPC-32183 or by a specific peptide inhibitor of NFAT activation. LPA slightly reduced the resorptive activity of osteoclasts in vitro. Thus, LPA binds to at least two receptor subtypes on osteoclasts: LPA(1), which couples through G(i/o) to elevate [Ca(2+)](i), activate NFATc1, and promote survival, and a second receptor that likely couples through G(12/13) and Rho to evoke and maintain retraction through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. These findings reveal a signaling axis in bone through which LPA, produced by osteoblasts, acts on multiple receptor subtypes to induce pleiotropic effects on osteoclast activity and function."

In the absence of NRL, photoreceptor precursors in mouse retina produce only cones that primarily express S-opsin. Conversely, ectopic expression of NRL in post-mitotic precursors leads to a rod-only retina. To explore the role of signaling molecules in modulating NRL function, we identified putative sites of post-translational modification in the NRL protein by in silico analysis. Here, we demonstrate the sumoylation of NRL in vivo and in vitro, with two small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) molecules attached to the Lys-20 residue. NRL-K20R and NRL-K20R/K24R sumoylation mutants show reduced transcriptional activation of Nr2e3 and rhodopsin promoters (two direct targets of NRL) in reporter assays when compared with wild-type NRL. Consistent with this, in vivo electroporation of the NRL-K20R/K24R mutant into newborn Nrl−/− mouse retina leads to reduced Nr2e3 activation and only a partial rescue of the Nrl−/− phenotype in contrast to the wild-type NRL that is able to convert cones to rod photoreceptors. Although PIAS3 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT3), an E3-SUMO ligase implicated in photoreceptor differentiation, can be immunoprecipitated with NRL, there appears to be redundancy in E3 ligases, and PIAS3 does not seem to be essential for NRL sumoylation. Our studies suggest an important role of sumoylation in fine-tuning the activity of NRL and thereby incorporating yet another layer of control in gene regulatory networks involved in photoreceptor development and homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2032185656,"Proteins bound to the poly(A) tail of mRNA transcripts, called poly(A)-binding proteins (Pabs), play critical roles in regulating RNA stability, translation, and nuclear export. Like many mRNA-binding proteins that modulate post-transcriptional processing events, assigning specific functions to Pabs is challenging because these processing events are tightly coupled to one another. To investigate the role that a novel class of zinc finger-containing Pabs plays in these coupled processes, we defined the mode of polyadenosine RNA recognition for the conserved Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nab2 protein and assessed in vivo consequences caused by disruption of RNA binding. The polyadenosine RNA recognition domain of Nab2 consists of three tandem Cys-Cys-Cys-His (CCCH) zinc fingers. Cells expressing mutant Nab2 proteins with decreased binding to polyadenosine RNA show growth defects as well as defects in poly(A) tail length but do not accumulate poly(A) RNA in the nucleus. We also demonstrate genetic interactions between mutant nab2 alleles and mutant alleles of the mRNA 3'-end processing machinery. Together, these data provide strong evidence that Nab2 binding to RNA is critical for proper control of poly(A) tail length."
https://openalex.org/W2084538598,"Regulated secretion is a fundamental process underlying the function of many cell types. In particular, acrosomal exocytosis in mammalian sperm is essential for egg fertilization. In general, exocytosis is initiated by a cytosolic calcium increase. In this report we show that calcium affects several factors during human sperm acrosomal exocytosis. By using an antibody that specifically recognizes synaptotagmin VI phosphorylated at the polybasic region of the C2B domain, we showed that a calcium-dependent dephosphorylation of this protein occurred at early stages of the acrosomal exocytosis in streptolysin O-permeabilized sperm. We identified the phosphatase as calcineurin and showed that the activity of this enzyme is absolutely required during the early steps of the secretory process. When added to sperm, an inhibitor-insensitive, catalytically active domain of calcineurin was able to rescue the effect of the specific calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A. This same domain dephosphorylated recombinant synaptotagmin VI C2B domain, validating this protein as a new substrate for calcineurin. When sperm were treated with catalytically active calcineurin before stimulation, exocytosis was inhibited, an effect that was rescued by the phosphomimetic synaptotagmin VI C2B-T418E,T419E mutant domain. These observations indicate that synaptotagmin must be dephosphorylated at a specific window of time and suggest that phosphorylated synaptotagmin has an active role at early stages of the acrosomal exocytosis."

We have evaluated the role of the transcriptional coactivator, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), in VLDL assembly and secretion. PGC-1alpha overexpression in HepG2 cells led to diminished rates of triglyceride (TG) synthesis but strongly stimulated VLDL-TG secretion, markedly increasing the efficiency of secretion of newly synthesized TG. PGC-1alpha overexpression increased the rate of secretion of apoB100 and promoted secretion of larger, less dense VLDL particles. PGC-1alpha overexpression in intact mouse liver also stimulated rates of VLDL TG secretion and attenuated hepatic TG accumulation resulting from high fat diet feeding. To determine the molecular mechanisms mediating the effect of PGC-1alpha on VLDL assembly, we evaluated the expression of several candidate mediators known to be involved in VLDL assembly or hepatic lipid homeostasis. Cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector B (CideB) expression was greatly induced by PGC-1alpha, and siRNA against CideB reversed the effects of PGC-1alpha on the secretion of TG and VLDL-sized particles by HepG2 cells, indicating that CideB is a critical mediator of stimulatory effects of PGC-1alpha on VLDL secretion. Collectively, these data suggest that PGC-1alpha plays an important role in partitioning cytoplasmic TG toward the VLDL secretory compartments and promoting VLDL secretion via transcriptional induction of CideB."
https://openalex.org/W2072323436,"Metric systems for semantics, or semantic cognitive maps, are allocations of words or other representations in a metric space based on their meaning. Existing methods for semantic mapping, such as Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, are based on paradigms involving dissimilarity metrics. They typically do not take into account relations of antonymy and yield a large number of domain-specific semantic dimensions. Here, using a novel self-organization approach, we construct a low-dimensional, context-independent semantic map of natural language that represents simultaneously synonymy and antonymy. Emergent semantics of the map principal components are clearly identifiable: the first three correspond to the meanings of ""good/bad"" (valence), ""calm/excited"" (arousal), and ""open/closed"" (freedom), respectively. The semantic map is sufficiently robust to allow the automated extraction of synonyms and antonyms not originally in the dictionaries used to construct the map and to predict connotation from their coordinates. The map geometric characteristics include a limited number ( approximately 4) of statistically significant dimensions, a bimodal distribution of the first component, increasing kurtosis of subsequent (unimodal) components, and a U-shaped maximum-spread planar projection. Both the semantic content and the main geometric features of the map are consistent between dictionaries (Microsoft Word and Princeton's WordNet), among Western languages (English, French, German, and Spanish), and with previously established psychometric measures. By defining the semantics of its dimensions, the constructed map provides a foundational metric system for the quantitative analysis of word meaning. Language can be viewed as a cumulative product of human experiences. Therefore, the extracted principal semantic dimensions may be useful to characterize the general semantic dimensions of the content of mental states. This is a fundamental step toward a universal metric system for semantics of human experiences, which is necessary for developing a rigorous science of the mind."

Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 15Nabors L.B. Gillespie G.Y. Harkins L. King P.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2154-2161PubMed Google Scholar). An important mechanism of posttranscriptional gene regulation involves a rapid degradation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) signaled by AU-rich elements in their 3′-untranslated regions (14Dibbens J.A. Miller D.L. Damert A. Risau W. Vadas M.A. Goodall G.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 16Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). However, stabilization of the RNA transcripts of different genes, including VEGF, may play a critical role in tumor growth and progression. HuR, a ubiquitously expressed member of the embryonic lethal abnormal vision family of RNA-binding proteins, can play an important role in regulating VEGF mRNA stability through its binding to the AU-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated regions (16Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 17Levy N.S. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Although predominantly nuclear, HuR shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm via a novel shuttling sequence, located in the hinge region between its second and third RNA recognition motifs (18Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 19Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The ability of HuR to shuttle has led to the suggestion that HuR may initially bind mRNAs in the nucleus and accompany them into the cytoplasm, providing an ongoing protection from the degradation machinery. In the present study, we show that the CNI-induced protumorigenic effects as observed in our previous findings may involve increased VEGF mRNA stability through HuR. In contrast, the mTOR inhibitor RAPA may decrease the stability of VEGF mRNA in renal cancer cells and may thus promote an antitumorigenic effect. CsA (Novartis) was purchased from the Children's Hospital Boston pharmacy, and RAPA was purchased from LC laboratories. Actinomycin D was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The gene-specific siRNAs for HuR along with its control were purchased from Qiagen. The kinase-inactive (dominant negative, DN) PKC-δ plasmid (PKC-δ KR) was a generous gift from R. Dutta (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) (20Pal S. Claffey K.P. Cohen H.T. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26277-26280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The antibodies against HuR, PKC-δ, phosphoserine, and Sp1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibodies against GAPDH and β-actin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The control normal rabbit IgG was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The human renal cancer cell lines (786-0 and Caki-1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories). Subconfluent cells were first preincubated with 5.0 μg/ml actinomycin D for 1 h; cells were then treated with immunosuppressive agents for different time intervals (0–6 h) in the presence of actinomycin D. Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized using cloned avian myeloblastosis virus first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). To analyze VEGF expression, real-time PCR was performed using the Assays-on-Demand Gene Expression product (TaqMan, Mammalian Gene Collection probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). As an internal control, GAPDH mRNA was amplified. Gene-specific primers were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Ct value (the cycle number at which emitted fluorescence exceeded an automatically determined threshold) for gene of interest (VEGF) was corrected by the Ct value for GAPDH and expressed as ΔCt. The fold change in mRNA amount was calculated as described before (13Basu A. Contreras A.G. Datta D. Flynn E. Zeng L. Cohen H.T. Briscoe D.M. Pal S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5689-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The data were represented as percentage decrease in mRNA levels using a semilogarithmic scale. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear extract kit (Active Motif). The purities of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were confirmed by checking the expression of a cytoplasmic protein GAPDH and a nuclear protein Sp1. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 0.5 mg of total protein at antibody excess. Immunocomplexes were captured with protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), and bead-bound proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using specific antibody. Protein samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corporation). The membrane was probed with specific primary antibody and subsequently incubated with peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. The reactive band was detected by chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For mRNA stability experiments, changes in VEGF expression over the 6-h time period were compared between treatments using a repeated-measures mixed model regression analysis with the F test used to evaluate overall slope differences and t tests for multiple pairwise comparisons (21Vittinghoff E. Glidden D.V. Shiboski S.C. McCulloch C.E. Regression Methods in Biostatistics. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2005: 253-289Crossref Google Scholar). The first-order autoregressive correlation structure was chosen to minimize the Akaike information criterion and provide the best fit to the measurements of VEGF mRNA expression over the time course. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc./IBM, Chicago, IL). Two-tailed p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. For other experiments, statistical evaluation for data analysis was determined by Student's t test. Differences with p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In our recent study (13Basu A. Contreras A.G. Datta D. Flynn E. Zeng L. Cohen H.T. Briscoe D.M. Pal S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5689-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that the CNI CsA can promote a rapid progression of human renal cancer through the transcriptional activation of the angiogenic cytokine VEGF. Here, we tried to determine whether CsA could also regulate the mRNA stability of VEGF in renal cancer cells. To this end, 786-0 and Caki-1 cells were incubated with actinomycin D (to block de novo mRNA synthesis) and then treated with either CsA or the vehicle alone for different time points; VEGF mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 1, the rate of VEGF mRNA degradation was much slower in the CsA-treated group compared with vehicle-treated controls; the VEGF mRNA half-life for the CsA-treated group was ∼6 h, whereas that of the control group was ∼4 h. This observation suggests that the CsA treatment may increase VEGF mRNA stability in renal cancer cells. We also examined whether CsA treatment could increase the mRNA stability of transforming growth factor-β and basic fibroblast growth factor, two other cytokines also known to regulate angiogenesis. However, we could not detect any significant change (data not shown) in the mRNA stability of these two cytokines following CsA treatment in renal cancer cells. We next studied the effect of the mTOR inhibitor RAPA on VEGF mRNA stability in renal cancer cells. In contrast to our findings with CsA treatment, we observed that RAPA decreased the stability of VEGF mRNA in both 786-0 and Caki-1 cells compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 1); the VEGF mRNA half-life for the RAPA-treated group was ∼3 h, whereas that of the control group was ∼4 h. In addition, the combination treatment with CsA and RAPA significantly decreased CsA-induced VEGF mRNA stability (Fig. 1A). Together, these observations suggest that the protumorigenic effect of CsA might involve the increased mRNA stability of the angiogenic cytokine VEGF. On the other hand, the antiangiogenic effect of RAPA might involve decreased VEGF mRNA stability. As discussed earlier, HuR may play a significant role in VEGF mRNA stability (16Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 17Levy N.S. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to determine whether CsA-induced VEGF mRNA stability involves HuR. We first transfected 786-0 cells with either HuR-specific siRNA or control siRNA. The siRNA-transfected cells were then incubated with actinomycin D, treated with either CsA or vehicle alone for different time points, and then VEGF mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 2A, in control siRNA-transfected cells, CsA treatment significantly increased VEGF mRNA stability (half-life ∼6 h) compared with vehicle-treated controls (half-life ∼4 h); however, transfection of the cells with HuR siRNA significantly decreased CsA-induced VEGF mRNA stability (half-life ∼2 h). The knockdown (∼70%) of HuR following siRNA transfection was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). This finding suggests that HuR may play a critical role in CsA-induced VEGF mRNA stability in renal cancer cells. We tried to examine whether CsA treatment can alter the mRNA and protein expression of HuR in renal cancer cells. The 786-0 cells were treated with CsA for different time intervals. Vehicle-treated cells served as controls. Following treatment, HuR mRNA and protein expression were measured by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, there was no significant change in the expression of HuR mRNA and protein following CsA treatment compared with controls. Thus, although CsA-induced VEGF mRNA stability is dependent on HuR, CsA treatment does not alter the expression level of this RNA-binding protein. It has been reported that the stimulus-induced stabilization of many AU-rich element-containing mRNAs by HuR is attributable to an increased shuttling of HuR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which in turn is controlled by different signaling molecules/pathways, including PKC (22Doller A. Akool el-S. Huwiler A. Müller R. Radeke H.H. Pfeilschifter J. Eberhardt W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 2608-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Here, we tested whether the treatment of human renal cancer cells with CsA could promote any changes in the subcellular localization of endogenous HuR. We treated the 786-0 and Caki-1 cells with CsA for different time points. Vehicle-treated cells served as controls. Following treatment, the cytoplasmic and the nuclear fractions were isolated from the cells, and the expression of HuR was measured by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, CsA treatment indeed increased the expression level of cytoplasmic HuR in both the cell types compared with controls. As expected, there was also a decrease in the expression level of nuclear HuR following CsA treatment (supplemental Fig. 1). This result suggests that CsA treatment can promote the translocation of HuR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of renal cancer cells. In our previous report (13Basu A. Contreras A.G. Datta D. Flynn E. Zeng L. Cohen H.T. Briscoe D.M. Pal S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5689-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that the CsA treatment can induce the phosphorylation of PKC-δ. It has also been shown that the increased nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HuR is dependent on PKC-δ (22Doller A. Akool el-S. Huwiler A. Müller R. Radeke H.H. Pfeilschifter J. Eberhardt W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 2608-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As we observed that CsA promotes the shuttling of HuR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, we next examined whether CsA treatment could induce the association between HuR and PKC-δ. Through immunoprecipitation using anti-PKC-δ, and Western blot analysis with ant-HuR, we observed that the CsA treatment markedly increased the association between HuR and PKC-δ in 786-0 cells compared with controls (Fig. 5A, upper left and right panels); we confirmed that HuR was not co-immunoprecipitated when we performed the immunoprecipitation with a control IgG (negative control) (Fig. 5A, bottom panel). We also had a similar observation (data not shown) in Caki-1 cells. In contrast, there was either no significant change or some decrease in the basal association between HuR and PKC-δ following treatment of the renal cancer cells with RAPA (Fig. 5B). Next, we tested whether the CsA treatment could lead to the phosphorylation of HuR. To this end, we treated the 786-0 cells with CsA, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-HuR antibody, and subsequently Western blot analysis was performed with antibody against phosphoserine. As shown in Fig. 6, CsA treatment indeed increased the phosphorylation of HuR compared with controls. Together, these findings suggest that the CsA treatment induces the association between HuR and PKC-δ, which may probably lead to the phosphorylation of HuR. Here, we tried to dissect whether CsA-mediated cytoplasmic translocation of HuR involves PKC-δ. The 786-0 cells were first transfected with either a specific DN plasmid of PKC-δ or the empty expression vector; the cells were then treated with CsA for different time intervals. Vehicle-treated cells served as controls. Following treatment, the cytoplasmic fractions were isolated, and the expression of HuR was measured by Western blot analysis. In empty vector-transfected cells, CsA treatment markedly increased the expression level of cytoplasmic HuR compared with controls (Fig. 7, upper left panel); there was also a decrease in the expression level of nuclear HuR in these cells following CsA treatment (data not shown). In contrast, in PKC-δ DN-transfected cells, CsA treatment could not promote any significant change in the expression level of cytoplasmic HuR compared with controls (Fig. 7, lower left panel). These observations suggest that PKC-δ may play an important role in CsA-induced cytoplasmic translocation of HuR. Our earlier experiments demonstrated that CsA-induced VEGF mRNA stability is dependent on HuR, and PKC-δ plays an important role in the cytoplasmic translocation of HuR. Here, we wished to examine the role of PKC-δ in CsA-induced VEGF mRNA stability. The 786-0 cells were transfected with either the specific DN plasmid of PKC-δ or the empty expression vector. The cells were then incubated with actinomycin D and treated with either CsA or the vehicle alone for different time points. As shown in Fig. 8, in empty vector-transfected cells, CsA treatment increased VEGF mRNA stability compared with vehicle-treated control, and the transfection with PKC-δ DN plasmid significantly decreased CsA-induced VEGF mRNA stability. These results suggest that PKC-δ-mediated signaling events may play an important role in CsA-induced VEGF mRNA stability. It is now well established that the patients treated with various immunosuppressive agents often develop different types of cancer, including renal cancer. We have previously reported that the CNIs may play a critical role in the rapid progression of human renal cancer through the transcriptional activation of VEGF (13Basu A. Contreras A.G. Datta D. Flynn E. Zeng L. Cohen H.T. Briscoe D.M. Pal S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5689-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that CNIs may also promote VEGF overexpression by increasing its mRNA stability through the mRNA-binding protein HuR; the PKC-δ may act as a critical intermediary signaling molecule in this process. In contrast, we find that the mTOR inhibitor RAPA can decrease VEGF mRNA stability. The calcineurin complex consists of three subunits, the catalytic A, the regulatory B, and calmodulin (23Klee C.B. Crouch T.H. Krinks M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 6270-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The cellular calcium activates the catalytic subunit for its function as serine/threonine phosphatase, resulting in the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells family of transcription factors (24Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 25Graef I.A. Chen F. Chen L. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 2001; 105: 863-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The CNI CsA binds to cyclophylin, a cytoplasmic protein, and the resultant complex binds to the regulatory B subunit of calcineurin and prevents the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (26Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar). However, apart from inhibiting nuclear factor of activated T cells, the CNIs may also regulate other signaling molecules involved in the expression of VEGF and other genes (13Basu A. Contreras A.G.

Contreras A.G. Basu A. Dormond O. Flynn E. Briscoe D.M. Pal S. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 8902-8909Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have also shown that CNIs can promote VEGF overexpression through the activation of PKC-ζ and PKC-δ (13Basu A. Contreras A.G. Datta D. Flynn E. Zeng L. Cohen H.T. Briscoe D.M. Pal S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5689-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Chen et al. (31Chen C. Johnston T.D. Jeon H. Gedaly R. McHugh P. Ranjan D. J. Surg. Res. 2009; 153: 156-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) have recently reported that CsA-induced oxidative stress can up-regulate and activate PKC-ζ in Epstein-Barr virus-infected human B cells; and CsA-induced PKC-ζ activation may act as an important signaling step in Epstein-Barr virus-induced lymphoproliferative disorders in transplant patients. In this study, we have shown that the PKC-δ pathway may play a significant role in CsA-induced VEGF mRNA stability in renal cancer cells. The expression of VEGF is regulated by a tight control of both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms (14Dibbens J.A. Miller D.L. Damert A. Risau W. Vadas M.A. Goodall G.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 15Nabors L.B. Gillespie G.Y. Harkins L. King P.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2154-2161PubMed Google Scholar). The posttranscriptional events are generally attributable to the 3′-untranslated region containing the AU-rich elements functionally involved in the regulation of mRNA decay (14Dibbens J.A. Miller D.L. Damert A. Risau W. Vadas M.A. Goodall G.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 16Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Several transactivating RNA-binding factors recognize the AU-rich cis-elements. HuR is one of the most important RNA-binding proteins playing a critical role in VEGF mRNA stability (16Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 17Levy N.S. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Our observations show that the CNI-induced VEGF mRNA stability is mediated through HuR. The activation process of HuR within the cell is regulated by different factors, including PKC. In support to our findings, Doller et al. (22Doller A. Akool el-S. Huwiler A. Müller R. Radeke H.H. Pfeilschifter J. Eberhardt W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 2608-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that PKC-δ can activate HuR and promote angiotensin II-induced mRNA stability of cyclooxygenase-2. Our observations suggest that CsA treatment induces the binding of HuR with PKC-δ and to a lesser extent with PKC-ζ (data not shown) and promotes HuR phosphorylation. We found that CsA-induced and PKC-δ-mediated phosphorylation of HuR is associated with the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of this mRNA-binding protein, as evident by an increase in the expression level of cytoplasmic HuR and a decrease in nuclear HuR. However, the detectable change for the decrease in nuclear HuR always varied in the range of ∼20–50%, possibly due to the predominant and abundant nuclear localization of this protein. We suggest that CsA-induced nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HuR may finally lead to increased VEGF mRNA stability. These findings again indicate a direct tumorigenic effect of CsA, which is independent of its function as an immunosuppressive agent. Interestingly, in contrast to CNIs, the mTOR inhibitor RAPA has been shown to have antitumorigenic effects. Guba et al. (7Guba M. von Breitenbuch P. Steinbauer M. Koehl G. Flegel S. Hornung M.

Med. 2002; 8: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that RAPA inhibits tumor angiogenesis by blocking VEGF production and VEGF-induced vascular endothelial cell stimulation. Koehl et al. (8Koehl G.E. Andrassy J. Guba M. Richter S. Kroemer A. Scherer M.N. Steinbauer M. Graeb C. Schlitt H.J. Jauch K.W. Geissler E.K. Transplantation. 2004; 77: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) have reported that RAPA can protect allografts from rejection while simultaneously attacking tumors in immunosuppressed animals. Cho et al. (32Cho C.S. Chang Z. Elkahwaji J. Scheunemann T.L. Manthei E.R. Colburn M. Knechtle S.J. Hamawy M.M. Int. Immunol. 2003; 15: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have reported that RAPA can antagonize CsA- and FK506-mediated augmentation of linker for activation of T cell expression; it has been suggested that as CsA, unlike FK506 and RAPA, does not bind to the intracellular immunophilin FK-binding protein, the antagonism between these drugs is not simply due to competition for intracellular FK-binding protein. Our results in this study suggest that RAPA can significantly inhibit VEGF mRNA stability even in the presence of CsA. It has been reported that the effective doses of RAPA for immunosuppression coincide with doses required for its antiangiogenic effects (6Guba M. Graeb C. Jauch K.W. Geissler E.K. Transplantation. 2004; 77: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This allows RAPA to be considered for the effective treatment of organ rejection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. In addition, RAPA may also be used in a combination therapy with CsA and other CNIs to prevent tumor growth in immunosuppressed patients. In summary, although the CNIs are widely used in patients for preventing allograft rejection and autoimmune diseases, they may have various adverse effects, including the development of cancer. Thus, the mechanism(s) of CNI-mediated cancer development should be thoroughly investigated. Our previous work and the present study clearly demonstrate that the CNI treatment may play a significant role in the rapid progression of human renal cancer through VEGF overexpression; CNIs can regulate the VEGF gene expression at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. However, the relative contribution of transcription versus mRNA stability on CNI-induced VEGF overexpression still needs to be determined. Targeting these pathways or the intermediary signaling molecules may serve as novel therapeutics for the prevention of cancer in patients receiving CNIs as immunosuppressive therapy.

To analyze PTK6-interacting proteins, we have expressed Flag-tagged PTK6 in HEK293 cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation assays with Flag antibody-conjugated agarose. A 164-kDa protein in the precipitated fraction was identified as ARAP1 (also known as centaurin δ-2) by MALDI-TOF mass analysis. ARAP1 associated with PTK6 in an EGF/EGF receptor (EGFR)-dependent manner. In addition, the SH2 domain of PTK6, particularly the Arg105 residue that contacts the phosphate group of the tyrosine residue, was essential for the association. Moreover, PTK6 phosphorylated residue Tyr231 in the N-terminal domain of ARAP1. Expression of ARAP1, but not of the Y231F mutant, inhibited the down-regulation of EGFR in HEK293 cells expressing PTK6. Silencing of endogenous PTK6 expression in breast carcinoma cells decreased EGFR levels. These results demonstrate that PTK6 enhances EGFR signaling by inhibition of EGFR down-regulation through phosphorylation of ARAP1 in breast cancer cells.

We have recently shown that the targeting of PTK6 to the plasma membrane enhances its oncogenic ability, while nuclear localization does not, demonstrating the importance of its association with the plasma membrane during tumorigenesis (16Kim H.I. Lee S.T. J. Biochem. 2009; 146: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Molecular details of the function of PTK6 have been revealed through the identification of interacting proteins and substrates of PTK6. The nuclear RNA-binding protein Sam68 is phosphorylated by and interacts with PTK6, and phosphorylation of Sam68 attenuates its RNA binding ability (17Derry J.J. Richard S. Valderrama Carvajal H.

PTK6 and insulin receptor substrate 4 interact through the SH3 and SH2 domains of PTK6 after stimulation by IGF-1, and this interaction increases the tyrosine phosphorylation and enzymatic activity of PTK6 (23Qiu H. Zappacosta F. Su W. Annan R.S. Miller W.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5656-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PTK6 also interacts with ErbB2 and enhances ErbB2-induced cell proliferation by inducing prolonged activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway and activation of the cyclin E/cdk2 complex (24Xiang B.

One PTK6-interacting protein, Arf-GAP, Rho-GAP, ankyrin repeat, and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing protein 1 (ARAP1; also known as centaurin δ-2), was further analyzed for the effects of serum-depletion, EGF stimulation, and PTK6 catalytic activity on interactions with PTK6. In addition, domains important for the interaction of PTK6 and ARAP1 were assigned, and the phosphorylation site of ARAP1 by PTK6 was determined. Finally, the effect of ARAP1 phosphorylation by PTK6 on down-regulation of EGF receptor (EGFR) was studied. Anti-ARAP1 antibody has been previously described (30Miura K. Jacques K.M. Stauffer S.

Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Billerica, MA). Anti-Myc agarose, anti-Brk (PTK6), anti-phospho-Erk1/2, anti-Erk2, anti-phospho-EGFR (Tyr1173), anti-β-actin, and anti-Myc antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

EGF, puromycin, and monodansyl cadaverine (MDC) were obtained from Sigma. To generate an expression construct for Flag-PTK6-SH3-SH2, a cDNA encoding the translation initiation codon, Flag tag, and 3–174 amino acid residues of PTK6 was amplified by PCR using pcDNA3. 1-Flag-PTK6 (16Kim H.I. Lee S.T. J. Biochem. 2009; 146: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) as template and the primer pair listed in supplemental Table S1. To construct expression vectors for Flag-PTK6-SH2 and Flag-PTK6-Linker-Kinase, cDNAs encoding 76–174 and 171–451 residues of PTK6 were PCR-amplified using pBS-PTK6-MR (2Lee H. Kim M. Lee K.H. Kang K.N. Lee S.T. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar) as template and primer pairs that included the Flag tag sequence (supplemental Table S1), respectively. The amplified fragments were digested with HindIII and EcoRI, and ligated into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To make an expression construct for a variant of PTK6 containing an SH3 domain and a novel C-terminal proline-rich sequence (PTK6-SH3-PR), which is encoded from an alternatively spliced form of PTK6 transcript (3Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Shipley J. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a fragment of PTK6 cDNA (nucleotide positions 272–393 of GenBankTM NM_005975) was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis using pcDNA3.1-Flag-PTK6 as template and the primer pair listed in supplemental Table S1. The R105A mutation was introduced into the Flag-PTK6-SH2 expression plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis (supplemental Table S1) with the QuikChange kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To make an expression construct for Myc-tagged ARAP1ΔSAM, the Flag tag of pCI-Flag-ARAP1ΔSAM (30Miura K. Jacques K.M. Stauffer S. Kubosaki A. Zhu K. Hirsch D.S. Resau J. Zheng Y. Randazzo P.A. Mol.

An expression construct for Myc-ARAP1 was generated through amplification of the N-terminal region of ARAP1 containing the Myc tag using pCI-Flag-ARAP1 (31Yoon H.Y. Lee J.S. Randazzo P.A. Traffic. 2008; 9: 2236-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as template and a primer pair (supplemental Table S2) and ligation into the XhoI and XbaI sites of pCI-Flag-ARAP1. Myc-ARAP1-Y23F, Y231F, and Y288F were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using pCI-Myc-ARAP1 as template and primer pairs described in supplemental Table S2. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) and human breast carcinoma cell lines, BT-474 and T-47D, were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5 and 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. For transient expression, HEK293 cells or HEK293 cells stably expressing Flag-PTK6 (HEK293-Flag-PTK6) were transfected with each of the expression constructs using WelFect-EXTM PLUS (WelGENE, Daegu, Korea), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For stable expression, HEK293 cells were transfected with each expression construct using the calcium phosphate method, followed by selection with 1,200 μg/ml of G418. After 2 weeks, G418-resistant colonies were cloned and expanded. Subconfluent HEK293-Flag-PTK6 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.05% protease inhibitor mixture (Cat. No. P8340, Sigma)) on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The cell lysate containing Flag-PTK6 was incubated with anti-Flag M2 agarose that had been equilibrated in PBS buffer at 4 °C for 4 h. The resin was washed in PBS buffer three times. The precipitated Flag-tagged proteins were boiled in SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and separated by SDS-PAGE. For proteomic analysis of the proteins, the gel was stained with a colloidal Coomassie staining solution (17% ammonium sulfate, 3% phosphoric acid, 34% methanol, and 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250). Interesting bands in the stained gel were subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin, mass spectrometry, and mass fingerprinting, as described previously (32Hwang I.K. Park S.M. Kim S.Y. Lee S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1702: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mass analysis was performed on a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the reflect mode. For protein identification, measured monoisotopic masses of peptides were analyzed using the MASCOT search program (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) with the MSDB data base. For EGF stimulation, subconfluent cells were starved in a serum-free medium for 24 h and, if necessary, pretreated with a drug for 30 min. Then the cells were stimulated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for the indicated time intervals. For Western blot analysis, cell lysates mixed with SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The immunoreactive proteins were detected with primary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). For pull-down assays, cell lysate was incubated with anti-Myc antibody or anti-Flag M2 antibody-conjugated agarose equilibrated in PBS buffer at 4 °C for 1 h or 4 h, respectively. For PTK6 immunoprecipitation, cell lysate was incubated with anti-PTK6 antibody at 4 °C overnight, and then with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h. The resin was washed in PBS buffer three times. Proteins bound to the resin were mixed with SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot analysis. For quantification of EGFR level, chemiluminescence was detected by LAS-3000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and quantified by Multi Gauge V2.2 software (Fujifilm). Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. PTK6 shRNA constructs (MISSONTM TRC shRNA, Sigma) were screened for the ability to knockdown PTK6 expression. PTK6-shRNA 1064 (TRCN000021552) and 1866 (TRCN000021549), which most efficiently decreased PTK6 expression, were transfected into BT-474 cells using WelFext-EXTM PLUS and selected with 1 μg/ml of puromycin. Puromycin-resistant cells were pooled and expanded. After washing twice with ice-cold PBS, cell-surface proteins were biotinylated with 0.1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min on ice. Unreacted biotin was quenched and removed by washing twice with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 m glycine and twice with ice-cold PBS. For precipitation of surface biotinylated proteins, cells were lysed with lysis buffer and the cell lysate incubated with NeutrAvidin Plus UltraLink Resin (Pierce), equilibrated in lysis buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was washed with lysis buffer twice. Levels of cell-surface EGFR were analyzed by Western blot. To find interacting proteins of PTK6, Flag-tagged PTK6 (Flag-PTK6) expressed in HEK293 cells was pulled down with anti-Flag-agarose, and the precipitated proteins were then visualized in SDS gels by Coomassie Brilliant Blue Staining (Fig. 1A). Several bands were detected in the pull-down proteins from HEK293 cells expressing PTK6 compared with those from HEK293 cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1B). By in-gel digestion with trypsin and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, the co-purified proteins were identified as Arf-GAP, Rho-GAP, ankyrin repeat, and PH domain-containing protein 1 (ARAP1; also known as centaurin δ-2), heat shock protein 90-α, and Sam68 (Table 1). The ARAP1 peptides identified by mass spectrometry are shown in supplemental Table S3.TABLE 1Identification of pull-down proteins by trypsin in-gel digestion, MALDI-TOF MS, and peptide fingerprintingBand numberProtein nameMWNCBI accession No.CoverageScorekDa%1ARAP1162.09NP_00103520730852Heat shock protein 90-α84.48P07900241173Sam6848.20NP_00655032674PTK651.80NP_00596641207 Open table in a new tab As Flag-PTK6 was expressed at higher levels in HEK293 cells through transfection of increasing amounts of PTK6 expression vector, the amount of ARAP1 co-immunoprecipitated with PTK6 was increased (Fig. 1C). These results strongly suggest that an interaction occurs between PTK6 and ARAP1. An interaction of ARAP1 with PTK6 was observed in cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium (Fig. 1, B and C). To test the effect of serum on the interaction, HEK293 cells expressing Flag-PTK6 or vector were either starved for 24 h or cultured normally. The binding of ARAP1 to PTK6 was greatly decreased in the serum-depleted condition compared with the serum-supplemented normal culture condition (Fig. 2A). EGFR is known to activate the catalytic activity of PTK6 (10Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Jackson L.E. Dean C.J. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30956-30963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To test whether the interaction between PTK6 and ARAP1 is dependent on the activation of EGFR, serum-depleted HEK293 cells expressing Flag-tagged PTK6 were stimulated with EGF. Upon EGF stimulation, PTK6 interacted with ARAP1. The interaction was maintained in a pattern similar to that of EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Moreover, when an inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase, AG1478, was used to treat Flag-PTK6-expressing HEK293 cells, the association of PTK6 with ARAP1 was blocked (Fig. 2C). Thus, PTK6 interacts with ARAP1 in a manner that depends on the activation of EGFR catalytic activity. To investigate whether ARAP1 binding to PTK6 requires the catalytic activity of PTK6, binding of ARAP1 to Flag-PTK6 or, a catalytically inactive mutant, Flag-PTK6-K219M (11Kim H.I. Lee S.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28973-28980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was measured after stimulation with EGF. Loss of catalytic activity of PTK6 markedly diminished, but did not abolish, binding to ARAP1 (mean and S.D. referred to the wild-type PTK6 was 25.9 ± 8.9%) (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the catalytic activity of PTK6 is required for the full interaction with ARAP1. To identify the ARAP1-interaction domain of PTK6, HEK293 cells were transfected with various PTK6 constructs (Fig. 4A), including Flag-PTK6-SH3-SH2, Flag-PTK6-SH3-PR containing an SH3 domain and a unique proline-rich region, which is the product of an alternatively spliced transcript, Flag-PTK6-SH2, and Flag-PTK6-Linker-Kinase, or Flag-PTK6 as a positive control. Immunoprecipitates with Flag antibody from EGF-stimulated HEK293 cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-Flag and anti-ARAP1 antibodies. Flag-PTK6-Linker-Kinase and Flag-PTK6-SH3-PR did not bind ARAP1, while Flag-PTK6-SH3-SH2 and Flag-PTK6-SH2 did (Fig. 4B), indicating that the SH2 domain of PTK6 includes the binding site for ARAP1. Arg175 within the SH2 domain of v-Src makes contact with the phosphate group on a tyrosine residue (33Waksman G. Kominos D. Robertson S.C. Pant N. Baltimore D. Birge R.B. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Mayer B.J. Overduin M. Resh M.D. Rios C.B. Silverman L. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1992; 358: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and its mutation to Leu abrogates phosphotyrosine binding (34Bibbins K.B. Boeuf H. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Arg105 of PTK6, which corresponds to Arg175 of v-Src, was mutated to Ala (R105A). The R105A mutant disrupted the interaction between PTK6 and ARAP1 (Fig. 4C). This result suggests that the interaction involves the Arg105 residue in the SH2 domain of PTK6 and the phospho-tyrosine residue(s) of ARAP1. To identify the PTK6 interaction domain of ARAP1, wild-type Myc-ARAP1 or N-terminal sterile α motif (SAM), and proline-rich (PR) domain-deleted Myc-ARAP1 (Myc-ARAP1ΔSAM) were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells either transfected with vector or stably expressing PTK6 (Fig. 5A). Phosphorylation of ARAP1 and interaction between ARAP1 and PTK6 by EGF stimulation were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Wild-type ARAP1, but not the N-terminal-deleted ARAP1, was phosphorylated by, and interacted with PTK6, upon stimulation with EGF (Fig. 5B). The N-terminal region of ARAP1 deleted in Myc-ARAP1ΔSAM contains three tyrosine residues. To identify which residues of ARAP1 are targeted by PTK6, each tyrosine site was mutated to phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis. When Tyr231 of ARAP1 was mutated, ARAP1 was not phosphorylated and did not interact with PTK6 (Fig. 5C). Therefore, the N-terminal region of ARAP1, particularly Tyr231, is important for phosphorylation by, and interaction with, PTK6. ARAP1 has an Arf-GAP domain, which plays a role in endocytosis (30Miura K. Jacques K.M. Stauffer S. Kubosaki A. Zhu K. Hirsch D.S. Resau J. Zheng Y. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 35Nie Z. Randazzo P.A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, we first analyzed the effect of ARAP1 phosphorylation on the down-regulation of overexpressed Flag-EGFR (36He H. Levitzki A. Zhu H.J. Walker F. Burgess A. Maruta H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26741-26744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in normal culture medium supplemented with serum. Expression of either wild-type ARAP1 or the Y231F mutant in HEK293 cells that did not express PTK6 led to slight differences in EGFR levels. However, the expression of wild-type ARAP1 resulted in much higher EGFR levels than the expression of ARAP1-Y231F in HEK293 cells with PTK6 (Fig. 6, A and B). These results indicate that phosphorylation of ARAP1 by PTK6 is important for the inhibition of EGFR internalization and degradation. To test the effect of ARAP1 phosphorylation on EGFR internalization, an inhibitor of clathrin-dependent receptor endocytosis, MDC, was added to HEK293-PTK6 cells that were transiently expressing Flag-EGFR and either wild-type ARAP1 or the Y231F mutant. Interestingly, upon MDC treatment, EGFR levels were similar in both cells expressing ARAP1 and those with ARAP1-Y231F (Fig. 6, C and D). Thus, phosphorylation of ARAP1 by PTK6 inhibits the down-regulation of EGFR, largely by blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We next analyzed whether the EGF-induced phosphorylation of ARAP1 affects endogenous EGFR levels and its downstream signaling in serum-depleted HEK293-PTK6 cells that were transiently expressing either wild-type ARAP1 or the Y231F mutant. Under starvation conditions, basal levels of surface and total EGFR in HEK293-PTK6 cells expressing ARAP1-Y231F were similar to the levels in the cells expressing wild type ARAP1 (0 min in Fig. 7). Upon EGF stimulation, cells expressing ARAP1-Y231F decreased their levels of surface EGFR as well as total EGFR more rapidly, and displayed activation of Akt and Erks more transiently and weakly, than cells expressing wild-type ARAP1 (Fig. 7). These results indicate that EGF-induced phosphorylation of ARAP1 via PTK6 enhances EGFR and its downstream signaling by delaying EGFR down-regulation. The association between endogenous PTK6 and ARAP1 was assayed in two different human breast carcinoma cell lines, BT-474 and T-47D, which endogenously express EGFR, PTK6, and ARAP1. As in HEK293 cells ectopically expressing PTK6, EGF enhanced the interaction of PTK6 with ARAP1 in these cell lines (Fig. 8). The down-regulation of EGFR through the PTK6-dependent phosphorylation of ARAP1 was analyzed in BT-474 cells. Under normal culture conditions supplemented with serum, decreased expression of endogenous PTK6 in two different PTK6-knockdown BT-474 cell lines did not change the expression level of ARAP1, but did result in decreased EGFR levels (Fig. 9, A and B). Under serum-starved conditions, PTK6-knockdown BT-474 cells (1064 and 1866) and control cells (mock and vector) showed slight differences in surface and total EGFR levels (−EGF in Fig. 9, C–E). However, EGF stimulation resulted in much greater differences in EGFR levels (+EGF in Fig. 9, C–E). These results support our findings that the phosphorylation of ARAP1 by PTK6, and subsequent association between PTK6 and ARAP1, inhibits EGFR internalization. We have screened for interacting proteins of PTK6 using a pull-down assay with Flag-tagged PTK6, followed by proteomic analysis of the co-precipitated proteins.

An earlier study was done with an alternatively spliced variant of ARAP1 that does not encode the SAM and PR domains (ARAP1ΔSAM) (30Miura K. Jacques K.M. Stauffer S. Kubosaki A. Zhu K. Hirsch D.S. Resau J. Zheng Y. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In that report, it was shown that ARAP1ΔSAM associates with the Golgi and inhibits cell spreading via Arf-GAP and Rho-GAP activity (30Miura K. Jacques K.M. Stauffer S. Kubosaki A. Zhu K. Hirsch D.S.

Thus, ARAP1 was proposed to be a point of convergence for Arf, Rho, and phosphoinositides, and to serve as a node in a signaling network that coordinates the membrane and actin remodeling involved in cell movement. PTK6-interacting proteins differ in their requirement for PTK6 catalytic activity. For example, the adaptor protein BKS requires the catalytic activity of PTK6 for binding (20Mitchell P.J. Sara E.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4273-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas the nuclear RNA-binding protein Sam68 does not (17Derry J.J. Richard S. Valderrama Carvajal H. Ye X. Vasioukhin V. Cochrane A.W. Chen T. Tyner A.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6114-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is known that EGF induces PTK6 to interact with EGFR and activates it (12Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Fry M.J. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5471-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We found that stimulation of EGFR by EGF induces the interaction of PTK6 with ARAP1, and that an EGFR inhibitor, AG1478, blocks this association. Moreover, the kinase-dead PTK6 K219M mutant did not bind to ARAP1 as well as the wild-type Flag-PTK6. Thus, these results indicate that the catalytic activity of PTK6 contributes to the PTK6-ARAP1 interaction. Among PTK6-interacting proteins, Sam68, paxillin, and IRS-4 (17Derry J.J. Richard S.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5656-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) require both the SH2 and SH3 domains of PTK6 for interaction. Interestingly, we found that only the SH2 domain, and more specifically the phosphotyrosine recognition site, of PTK6 is involved in the interaction with ARAP1. Because the Tyr231 residue of ARAP1 was determined to be the major site phosphorylated by, and associated with, PTK6, we are sure that the SH2 domain of PTK6 binds to the Tyr231 of ARAP1. The literature related to the down-regulation of EGFR is complex. Although it is agreed that the first step is internalization of the receptor, multiple mechanisms have been reported, including a clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway (38Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 39Nesterov A. Carter R.E. Sorkina T. Gill G.N. Sorkin A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), a caveolin-dependent pathway (40Sigismund S. Argenzio E. Tosoni D. Cavallaro E. Polo S. Di Fiore P.P. Dev.

Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The results of our experiment using a clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitor, MDC, suggest that the down-regulation of EGFR in our system is largely mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Arf proteins are major regulators for the formation of intracellular vesicles. ARAP1 is reported to be an Arf-GAP that preferentially uses Arf5, but can also use Arf1 and Arf6 (30Miura K.

Casanova J.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C263-C270Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Arf6 has been implicated in multiple pathways of endocytosis (45Donaldson J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41573-41576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Whereas Arf1 plays a central role in the secretory pathway (46D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), it has recently been found to regulate endocytosis (42Kumari S. Mayor S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Arf5 has not been reported to be a regulator of endocytosis. Thus, it is possible that the effects of ARAP1 are mediated through an effect on Arf. The effect of ARAP1 on EGFR endocytosis is still being discovered. Yoon et al. (31Yoon H.Y. Lee J.S. Randazzo P.A. Traffic. 2008; 9: 2236-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) found that ARAP1 colocalizes with EGFR upon EGF stimulation. Reduction of ARAP1 expression accelerates the association of EGF/EGFR with EEA1-positive endosomes and the degradation of EGFR, and reduces the propagation of Erk and JNK signals (31Yoon H.Y. Lee J.S. Randazzo P.A. Traffic. 2008; 9: 2236-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Daniele et al. (47Daniele T. Di Tullio G. Santoro M. Turacchio G. Yoon H.Y. De Matteis M.A. Traffic. 2008; 9: 2221-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) also reported that ARAP1 is involved in the trafficking of EGFR. In contrast to the report by Yoon et al. (31Yoon H.Y. Lee J.S. Randazzo P.A. Traffic. 2008; 9: 2236-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), they found that overexpression of ARAP1 increases the degradation of EGFR in peripheral endosomal compartments. In addition, the ARAP1 knockdown accumulates EGFR in sorting/late endosomal compartments and delays EGFR degradation and Erk inactivation (47Daniele T. Di Tullio G. Santoro M. Turacchio G. Yoon H.Y. De Matteis M.A. Traffic. 2008; 9: 2221-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). According to our findings, wild-type ARAP1, which is phosphorylated by PTK6 on Tyr231, delayed the down-regulation of EGFR, compared with the unphosphorylatable ARAP1 mutant (Y231F), in a HEK293 cell system. Also, knockdown of PTK6 in breast carcinoma BT-474 cells, which express endogenous PTK6, ARAP1, and EGFR, markedly increased the down-regulation of EGFR. This suggests that phospho-Tyr231 ARAP1 has enhanced Arf-GAP activity for the inactivation of Arf-GTP. One possible explanation for this regulation is that Tyr231 phosphorylation relieves the inhibition of Arf-GAP activity of ARAP1 caused by the SAM domain. The SAM domain may negatively regulate Arf-GAP activity by holding the GAP domain in an auto-inhibitory conformation (44Cuthbert E.J. Davis K.K. Casanova J.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C263-C270Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is possible that Tyr231 phosphorylation of ARAP1 by PTK6 and its binding to PTK6 destroys an auto-inhibited conformation of ARAP1 and leads to the inactivation of Arf-GTP. Another possibility for the regulation of ARAP1 activation via Tyr231 phosphorylation is through a change of localization of ARAP1. Campa et al. (43Campa F. Yoon H.Y. Ha V.L. Szentpetery Z. Balla T. Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28069-28083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) has shown that ARAP1 is recruited to the plasma membrane independent of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) and that subsequent production of PIP3 triggers Arf-GAP activity. Thus, we presume that ARAP1 might be phosphorylated by and recruited to PTK6 at the plasma membrane through its SH2 domain, prior to activation of Arf-GAP through the contact of its nearby PH domain with membrane PIP3. Interestingly, it was found that the kinase-dead PTK6 also interacts with ARAP1 following EGF stimulus, though with a lower extent than the catalytically active PTK6. Moreover, overexpression of EGFR in HEK293 cells slightly increases phosphorylation of ARAP1 in the absence of PTK6 (data not shown). These results suggest that EGFR itself, or PTKs downstream of EGFR, phosphorylates Tyr231 of ARAP1 to a lesser extent. Among the PTKs, the Src family members are most closely related to PTK6 (2Lee H. Kim M. Lee K.H. Kang K.N. Lee S.T. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Shipley J. Crompton M.R.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2053-2057PubMed Google Scholar) and are involved in endosomal trafficking of receptor-type tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR (48Carpenter G. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 49Kassenbrock C.K. Hunter S. Garl P. Johnson G.L. Anderson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24967-24975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Src is also known to phosphorylate ARAP1 (31Yoon H.Y. Lee J.S. Randazzo P.A. Traffic. 2008; 9: 2236-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We analyzed whether Src family members, Src and Lck, have an effect on EGFR internalization through the phosphorylation and interaction of ARAP1. Src and Lck phosphorylate the Y231F mutant of ARAP1, as well as wild-type ARAP1, indicating that Tyr231 and other residues of ARAP1 are phosphorylated by Src and Lck. In addition, phosphorylation of ARAP1 by these kinases seems not to depend on EGF stimulation and phosphorylated ARAP1 does not interact with Src and Lck (data not shown). Moreover, unlike PTK6, Src, and Lck did not have detectable effects on the down-regulation of EGFR (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, we assume that the association of ARAP1 with PTK6, as well as its phosphorylation, might be important for its role in the inhibition of EGFR internalization. In conclusion, we have identified ARAP1 as a novel interacting protein of PTK6. PTK6 phosphorylates ARAP1 and binds to the phosphorylated ARAP1 through its SH2 domain. PTK6-dependent ARAP1 phosphorylation inhibits EGFR internalization, increases the duration of EGF/EGFR signaling, and in turn, increases oncogenic abilities of the cells expressing PTK6. Novel regulatory mechanisms of ARAP1 by PTK6 may reveal how PTK6 potentiates EGF/EGFR signaling and tumorigenesis. Download .pdf (.15 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W1981053204,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and carries a dismal prognosis. We have developed a conditional cytotoxic/immunotherapeutic approach using adenoviral vectors (Ads) encoding the immunostimulatory cytokine, human soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (hsFlt3L) and the conditional cytotoxic molecule, i.e., Herpes Simplex Type 1- thymide kinase (TK). This therapy triggers an anti-tumor immune response that leads to tumor regression and anti-tumor immunological memory in intracranial rodent cancer models. We aim to test the efficacy of this immunotherapy in dogs bearing spontaneous GBM. In view of the controversy regarding the effect of human cytokines on dog immune cells, and considering that the efficacy of this treatment depends on hsFlt3L-stimulated dendritic cells (DCs), in the present work we tested the ability of Ad-encoded hsFlt3L to generate DCs from dog peripheral blood and compared its effects with canine IL-4 and GM-CSF.Our results demonstrate that hsFlT3L expressed form an Ad vector, generated DCs from peripheral blood cultures with very similar morphological and phenotypic characteristics to canine IL-4 and GM-CSF-cultured DCs. These include phagocytic activity and expression of CD11c, MHCII, CD80 and CD14. Maturation of DCs cultured under both conditions resulted in increased secretion of IL-6, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Importantly, hsFlt3L-derived antigen presenting cells showed allostimulatory potential highlighting their ability to present antigen to T cells and elicit their proliferation.These results demonstrate that hsFlt3L induces the proliferation of canine DCs and support its use in upcoming clinical trials for canine GBM. Our data further support the translation of hsFlt3L to be used for dendritic cells' vaccination and gene therapeutic approaches from rodent models to canine patients and its future implementation in human clinical trials."

NPM-ALK transforming activity is mediated by different cellular pathways through several downstream adaptors or scaffolding molecules with Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding domains that bind to the autophosphorylated NPM-ALK tyrosine residues (2Chiarle R. Voena C. Ambrogio C. Piva R. Inghirami G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Many studies have identified several NPM-ALK-interacting molecules such as PLC-γ, IRS-1, Hsp90, Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2), ShcC, Jak2, Jak3, PI3K, Stat3, and Stat5 (8Amin H.M. Lai R. Blood. 2007; 110: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Adaptor proteins Shc (SH2 domain-containing transforming protein), IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), and Grb2 bind NPM-ALK directly or in complexes, but their specific role in NPM-ALK-mediated lymphomagenesis is still unclear (2Chiarle R.

Shc and IRS-1 are tyrosine-phosphorylated and bind NPM-ALK in defined regions (Tyr567 and Tyr152–156 of NPM-ALK, respectively); however, they are dispensable for NPM-ALK-mediated transformation of NIH3T3 cells. In contrast, the interaction between NPM-ALK and Grb2 is still poorly characterized (9Fujimoto J. Shiota M. Iwahara T. Seki N. Satoh H. Mori S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Anticancer Drugs. 2006; 17: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Grb2 is a 26-kDa protein without catalytic activity and consists of a single SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains (12Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A.

The SH3 domains of Grb2 bind to proline-rich motifs on the guanine nucleotide-releasing factor Sos (Son of sevenless), leading to the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Two phosphorylation sites on Grb2 have been identified thus far at position Tyr209 in BCR-ABL-expressing cells (16Li S. Couvillon A.D. Brasher B.B. Van Etten R.A.

We identified Tyr160 as a major phosphorylation site of Grb2 by NPM-ALK. Remarkably, we found that Tyr160 of Grb2 also is phosphorylated by other oncogenic fusion tyrosine kinases such as TPR-MET, BCR-ABL, and TEL-JAK2, as well as by wild-type receptor tyrosine kinases such as ALK and MET. Further, we show that NPM-ALK combined mutations in Tyr152–156, Tyr567, and Pro415–417 almost completely abrogated Grb2 binding and Tyr160 phosphorylation. Finally, we show that Grb2 is essential for the activation of SHP2 in ALCL and is required for sustained ALCL cell growth.

ALK inhibitor CEP-14083 (Cephalon) was added at a working concentration of 300 nm. The PP2 Src family kinase inhibitor was purchased from Calbiochem and used at 30 μm. Whole cell extracts were prepared by resuspending the pelleted cells in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0,1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm 3Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) with incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. Cell lysates were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. Supernatants were analyzed for protein concentration with a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and stored at −80 °C. Twenty micrograms of protein were run on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. For phosphate digestion, cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in the presence of protease and in the presence/absence of phosphatase inhibitors. 10 μg of whole cell lysates were treated with 800 units of λPPase (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 30 °C. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 0.5 mg of whole cell extracts was precleared with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with 1–5 μg of monoclonal antibody or 5–10 μg of polyclonal antibody at 4 °C for 4 h. Immune complexes were collected on 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads, and the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were recovered by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with the specific antibody. Immune complexes were detected with sheep-anti mouse Ig antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-ALK (1:2000; Zymed Laboratories Inc., Seattle, WA), monoclonal anti-phospho-Tyr (PY100, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), polyclonal anti-Grb2 (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-actin (1:2000; Chemicon), polyclonal anti-phospho-Shp2 (Tyr542, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), polyclonal anti-phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), polyclonal anti-Stat3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), polyclonal anti-phospho-Erk1/2 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology), polyclonal anti-Erk1/2 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-JunB (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-phospho-Shc (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), polyclonal anti-Shc (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-GFP (1:2000; Invitrogen), polyclonal anti-Src (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-phospho-Met (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), monoclonal anti-human-Met (1:1000; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), monoclonal anti-AKT1 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), monoclonal anti-phospho-AKT1 (Ser473, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), monoclonal anti-JAK2 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), and monoclonal anti-JAK3 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Wild-type NPM-ALK or the kinase-dead mutant NPM-ALKK210R was cloned into pcDNA5TO vector (Invitrogen) at HindIII/XhoI sites and stably transfected into 293T-Rex Tet-On cells using Effectene reagent (Qiagen) as described previously (6Ambrogio C.

Pallino vectors containing NPM-ALK, NPM-ALKK210R, or ATIC-ALK were described previously (21Raz R. Lee C.K. Cannizzaro L.A. d'Eustachio P. Levy D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Human ALK full-length (ALK-FL) was cloned in pcDNA3 at HindIII/XhoI sites and hALKF1174L variant was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Grb2WT, the dominant-negative Grb2P49L (mutated in the N-terminal SH3 domain) and Grb2R86K (mutated in the SH2 domain) cloned in the pRK5 vector were kindly provided by Dr. A. Pellicer, New York University. Grb2 tyrosine-mutated forms were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human Grb2-specific shRNA sequences were from the Open Biosystems TRC lentiviral shRNA library. The sense strand of Grb2 shRNA that we used is the following: A, 5′-CAGATATTCCTGCGGGACATA-3′; B, 5′-CGGCTTCATTCCCAAGAACTA-3′; C, 5′-GATCTACATCTGTCTCCAGAA-3′; control, 5′-CCTCTCTGTCAAGTTTGGAAA-3′. The puromycin resistance gene was removed from the pLKO.1 vector. Lentivirus shGrb2 vectors were constructed by subcloning the H1 promoter-shALK cassette into the EcoRI-ClaI sites of the pLVTHM vector (kindly provided by D. Trono, University of Geneva, Switzerland) (19Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) as described previously (20Piva R. Chiarle R. Manazza A.D. Taulli R. Simmons W. Ambrogio C. D'Escamard V. Pellegrino E. Ponzetto C. Palestro G. Inghirami G. Blood. 2006; 107: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). shRNA Grb2 lentiviruses were obtained by co-transfection of the human HEK-293T cell line (Invitrogen) as described (19Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). After 72 h the percentages of transduced cells were analyzed for GFP expression by FACS. Inducible Grb2 shRNA interference TS cells were obtained by co-transduction with pLVTHM vector containing the H1 promoter Grb2 shRNA cassette and pLV-tTRKRAB vector. To generate Grb2 shRNA-resistant constructs, wild-type or Y160F Grb2 was mutated in four bases in the sequence corresponding to the shRNA (Grb2WTINT3/4 or Grb2Y160FINT3/4). The difference in cell growth between the different shGrb2 constructs was evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis rank test, and the difference between shGrb2 and the relative INT3/4 was evaluated using Student's t test. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Grb2 has been shown to bind NPM-ALK and ATIC-ALK in previous works (25Crockett D.K. Lin Z. Elenitoba-Johnson K.S. Lim M.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2617-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Trinei M. Lanfrancone L. Campo E. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Pelicci P.G. Falini B. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 793-798PubMed Google Scholar). First we wanted to test whether Grb2 could bind different ALK fusions regardless of their fusion partner or cellular localization. To this end we took advantage of three different ALK fusions that localize in different cellular compartments. We transfected human HEK-293T with ALK-FL, with NPM-ALK (which is both cytoplasmic and nuclear (27Bischof D. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar)), with its kinase-dead mutant (K210R), with ATIC-ALK (which is cytoplasmic), and with a chimeric fusion protein between CD8 and ALK (CD8-ALK) that localizes to the cytoplasmic membrane. Immunoprecipitation with an antibody that recognizes the ALK portion of these proteins showed that ALK fusions bound Grb2 regardless of their fusion partner or cellular localization (Fig. 1A). Unexpectedly, Grb2 was detected on a gel as two bands with different levels of mobility: one band with higher mobility migrating at the expected size of 26 kDa and another with lower mobility. To assess whether this lower mobility band was related to NPM-ALK tyrosine kinase activity, we transfected human HEK-293T cells with either NPM-ALK or its kinase-dead mutant, NPM-ALKK210R. Direct Western blot and Grb2 immunoprecipitation showed that both the binding and the lower mobility species appeared only in the presence of active NPM-ALK (Fig. 1, B and C, and supplemental Fig. 1). To verify that those bands with different mobility were not an artifact of NPM-ALK ectopic expression in HEK-293T cells, we analyzed Grb2 bands as detected in NPM-ALK-positive human lymphoma cells. To this end, we took advantage of a cellular system developed previously by our group based on a doxycycline-dependent inducible anti-ALK shRNA that abrogates NPM-ALK expression in ALCL (20Piva R. Chiarle R. Manazza A.D. Taulli R. Simmons W. Ambrogio C. D'Escamard V. Pellegrino E. Ponzetto C. Palestro G. Inghirami G. Blood. 2006; 107: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the Grb2 band with lower mobility disappeared after NPM-ALK knockdown (Fig. 1D) in TS and SU-DHL-1 cells. Similarly, inhibition of NPM-ALK activity via a specific small molecule, CEP-14083 (28Wan W. Albom M.S. Lu L. Quail M.R. Becknell N.C. Weinberg L.R. Reddy D.R. Holskin B.P. Angeles T.S. Underiner T.L. Meyer S.L. Hudkins R.L. Dorsey B.D. Ator M.A. Ruggeri B.A. Cheng M. Blood. 2006; 107: 1617-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), correlated with the synchronous disappearance of the lower mobility band of Grb2 (Fig. 1E). Because ALK is a tyrosine kinase, we reasoned that the lower mobility band would correspond to a phosphorylated form of Grb2. Thus, we treated cell extracts from human HEK-293T cells with λPPase, which dephosphorylates phosphoresidue on proteins. After λPPase treatment, the lower mobility band of Grb2 disappeared completely. Furthermore, an antibody specific for phosphotyrosines highlighted a band corresponding to the lower mobility band of Grb2 only in lysates not treated with λPPase (Fig. 1F). Therefore, we concluded that Grb2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in the presence of active NPM-ALK. Seven tyrosine residues are present in the human Grb2 protein. Three of them are located in the N-terminal SH3 domain (Tyr7, Tyr 37, and Tyr 52), two in the SH2 domain (Tyr 118 and Tyr 134), and two in the C-terminal SH3 domain (Tyr 160 and Tyr 209) (Fig. 2A) as described in UniProt, a freely accessible resource of protein sequence and functional information. To identify NPM-ALK-induced Grb2 phosphorylation site(s), the Grb2 coding region was mutated by means of site-directed mutagenesis on each tyrosine (Tyr to Phe) and then co-expressed with active NPM-ALK in HEK-293T cells. Previous studies had demonstrated the importance of Tyr209 in Grb2 phosphorylation after binding with the protein kinase BCR-ABL (16Li S. Couvillon A.D. Brasher B.B. Van Etten R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6793-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We first analyzed the Y209F mutant, which showed no alteration in the Grb2 migration pattern as compared with the wild-type form in cells expressing active NPM-ALK (Fig. 2B). Next, we mutated all of the other Grb2 tyrosine residues. As shown in Fig. 2B, all of these Grb2 mutants exhibited a similar migration pattern of the two bands except for the Grb2Y160F mutant. Indeed, Grb2 phosphorylation was completely abrogated in the Grb2Y160F mutant as revealed by the disappearance of the phosphorylated low mobility band by a phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2C). This observation was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of Grb2 protein as shown in Fig. 2D. Next we asked whether the phosphorylation of Grb2 in Tyr160 is limited to NPM-ALK or is shared by other oncogenic tyrosine kinases known to interact with Grb2, such as BCR-ABL (29Gishizky M.L. Cortez D. Pendergast A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 10889-10893Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), TPR-MET (30Ponzetto C. Zhen Z. Audero E. Maina F. Bardelli A. Basile M.L. Giordano S. Narsimhan R. Comoglio P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14119-14123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and TEL-JAK2 (31Ho J.M. Nguyen M.H. Dierov J.K. Badger K.M. Beattie B.K. Tartaro P. Haq R. Zanke B.W. Carroll M.P. Barber D.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 1438-1448PubMed Google Scholar). HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with Grb2 wild type or the Y160F mutant and the oncogenic kinases NPM-ALK, BCR-ABL, TPR-MET, TEL-JAK2, and TEL-JAK3, and total cells extracts were analyzed by Western blot. BCR-ABL, TPR-MET, and TEL-JAK2 induced a Grb2 phosphorylation similar to that of NPM-ALK, indicating that other relevant oncogenic kinase fusions have the ability to induce phosphorylation of Grb2 in Tyr160 (Fig. 3). Notably, we showed that a remarkable level of phosphorylation is induced by BCR-ABL on Grb2 Tyr 160, which was not recognized in a previous work (16Li S. Couvillon A.D. Brasher B.B. Van Etten R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6793-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TEL-JAK3 oncogenic fusion kinase, which has not been reported to bind Grb2, was unable to phosphorylate Grb2 (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that Grb2 phosphorylation is a common event in many, but not all, oncogenic fusion kinases. Oncogenic fusion kinases are characterized by strong and continuous kinase activity that alters the intensity and quality of the downstream signaling as compared with their non-oncogenic counterparts (32Matsumura I. Mizuki M. Kanakura Y. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether Grb2 phosphorylation is detectable also when non-fusion receptor tyrosine kinases are activated. HEK-293T cells were transfected with wild-type ALK or MET receptors. Remarkably, Grb2 phosphorylation on Tyr160 was observed in the presence of both ALK and MET receptors (Fig. 4). Furthermore, an activating point mutation of the full-length ALK receptor recently described in neuroblastomas (33George R.E. Sanda T. Hanna M. Fröhling S. Luther 2nd, W. Zhang J. Ahn Y. Zhou W. London W.B. McGrady P. Xue L. Zozulya S. Gregor V.E. Webb T.R. Gray N.S. Gilliland D.G. Diller L. Greulich H. Morris S.W. Meyerson M. Look A.T. Nature. 2008; 455: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) was able to phosphorylate Grb2 as well. Altogether, these data indicate that phosphorylation of Grb2 is a common event shared by both wild-type and oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Grb2 acts as an adaptor through its single SH2 and flanked SH3 domains. The backbone dynamics of Grb2 from NMR relaxation data show Grb2 as a flexible protein in which the SH3-SH2 linker regions are flexible (34Yuzawa S. Yokochi M. Hatanaka H. Ogura K. Kataoka M. Miura K. Mandiyan V. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Grb2 crystal structure shows a compact dimer structure with intramolecular contact between two SH3 domains (35Maignan S. Guilloteau J.P. Fromage N. Arnoux B. Becquart J. Ducruix A. Science. 1995; 268: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Usually, SH2 domains bind pYXNX phosphotyrosine sequences and SH3 domain proline-rich sequences. To test whether functional Grb2 SH2 and SH3 domains are required for Grb2 interaction with NPM-ALK or for its phosphorylation, we generated different Grb2 mutants by site-directed mutagenesis, inserting a point mutation in each SH domain. As published previously, the introduction in Grb2 of a single point mutation at position R86K leads to a SH2 domain loss-of-function mutant, whereas P49L and G203R mutants disrupt the N-terminal and C-terminal SH3 domains, respectively (36Hanafusa H. Torii S. Yasunaga T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Mutations in the SH2 domain (R86K) or the N-terminal SH3 domain (P49L) did not affect Grb2 phosphorylation. Conversely, a single point mutation disrupting the C-terminal SH3 domain (G203R) completely abolished Grb2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). NPM-ALK could potentially bind Grb2 directly or through other proteins such as SHP2, Shc, and IRS-1 (7Voena C. Conte C. Ambrogio C. Boeri Erba E. Boccalatte F. Mohammed S. Jensen O.N. Palestro G. Inghirami G. Chiarle R. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), (26Trinei M. Lanfrancone L. Campo E. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Pelicci P.G. Falini B. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 793-798PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated which region of NPM-ALK was involved in Grb2 binding. Our group recently performed an extensive phosphomapping of the NPM-ALK protein in human lymphoma cell lines, showing that at least 11 NPM-ALK tyrosine residues are phosphorylated in lymphoma cells (37Boccalatte F.E. Voena C. Riganti C. Bosia A. D'Amico L. Riera L. Cheng M. Ruggeri B. Jensen O.N. Goss V.L. Lee K. Nardone J. Rush J. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. Chiarle R. Inghirami G. Blood. 2009; 113: 2776-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because three of these residues (Tyr338, Tyr342, and Tyr343) are located in the NPM-ALK kinase domain and abolish its activity when mutated, 3R. Chiarle, unpublished observations. we decided to mutate all of the other known ALK tyrosine phosphorylation sites sequentially. Lysates from HEK-293T cells transiently transfected with these mutants were analyzed by Western blot for Grb2 phosphorylation. As expected, the sequential addition of mutations to NPM-ALK progressively reduced the ALK phosphorylat"
https://openalex.org/W2023108126,"Background Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has been widely used to study the mechanisms of mammalian fertilization and to rescue male-factor infertility in humans and animals. However, very few systematic analyses have been conducted to define factors affecting the efficiency of ICSI. In this study, we undertook a large-scale series of ICSI experiments in mice to define the factors that might affect outcomes. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a 5×3×2 factorial design with the following factors: mouse genotype (ICR, C57BL/6, DBA/2, C3H/He, and 129/Sv strains), type of male germ cells (epididymal sperm, elongated or round spermatids), and their freeze–thawing treatment. The efficiencies (parameters) of each developmental step were analyzed by three-way ANOVA (significance level P<0.01). The type of male germ cells affected all the four parameters observed: oocyte survival after injection, cleavage of oocytes, implantation, and birth of offspring. Genotype affected the oocyte survival, cleavage and birth rates, whereas freeze–thawing had no effects on any of the parameters. There were significant genotype/cell type interactions for oocyte survival and cleavage, indicating that they were determined by a combination of strain and germ cell maturity. Multiple comparisons revealed that spermatozoa and elongated spermatids gave better implantation and birth rates than did round spermatids, while spermatozoa and elongated spermatozoa were indistinguishable in their ability to support embryonic development. The best overall efficiency (birth rate per oocytes injected) was obtained with frozen–thawed DBA/2 strain elongated spermatids (23.2±4.2%). Conclusions/Significance The present study provides the first comprehensive information on ICSI using the mouse as a model and will contribute to the efficient use of materials, time, and efforts in biomedical research and clinics involving ICSI."

Antibody against topo IIβ co-precipitated RNA-binding proteins including PSF, NonO/p54nrb, as well as hnRNP U/SAF-A/SP120. Reconstitution experiments with tag-purified proteins showed that topo IIβ associates stoichiometrically with SP120 in the presence of RNA that was co-purified with SP120. The most effective RNA species for the complex formation was a subset of cellular polyadenylated RNAs. The C-terminal 187-residue domain of SP120 was necessary and sufficient for the association with both topo IIβ and the endogenous RNA. The RNA isolated from the tag-purified SP120 inhibited the relaxation of supercoiled DNA by topo IIβ. When the enzyme associates with SP120, however, the inhibition was abolished and the catalytic property was modulated to more processive mode, which may prolong its residence time at the genomic target site. Furthermore, the presence of SP120 was required for the stable expression of topo IIβ in vivo. Thus, SP120 regulates the enzyme in dual ways.

https://openalex.org/W2084191389,"Meningococcal meningitis outbreaks occur every year during the dry season in the “meningitis belt” of sub-Saharan Africa. Identification of the causative strain is crucial before launching mass vaccination campaigns, to assure use of the correct vaccine. Rapid agglutination (latex) tests are most commonly available in district-level laboratories at the beginning of the epidemic season; limitations include a short shelf-life and the need for refrigeration and good technical skills. Recently, a new dipstick rapid diagnostic test (RDT) was developed to identify and differentiate disease caused by meningococcal serogroups A, W135, C and Y. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of this dipstick RDT during an urban outbreak of meningitis caused by N. meningitidis serogroup A in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; first against an in-country reference standard of culture and/or multiplex PCR; and second against culture and/or a highly sensitive nested PCR technique performed in Oslo, Norway. We included 267 patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis. Using the in-country reference standard, 50 samples (19%) were positive. Dipstick RDT sensitivity (N = 265) was 70% (95%CI 55–82) and specificity 97% (95%CI 93–99). Using culture and/or nested PCR, 126/259 (49%) samples were positive; dipstick RDT sensitivity (N = 257) was 32% (95%CI 24–41), and specificity was 99% (95%CI 95–100). We found dipstick RDT sensitivity lower than values reported from (i) assessments under ideal laboratory conditions (>90%), and (ii) a prior field evaluation in Niger [89% (95%CI 80–95)]. Specificity, however, was similar to (i), and higher than (ii) [62% (95%CI 48–75)]. At this stage in development, therefore, other tests (e.g., latex) might be preferred for use in peripheral health centres. We highlight the value of field evaluations for new diagnostic tests, and note relatively low sensitivity of a reference standard using multiplex vs. nested PCR. Although the former is the current standard for bacterial meningitis surveillance in the meningitis belt, nested PCR performed in a certified laboratory should be used as an absolute reference when evaluating new diagnostic tests."
https://openalex.org/W1966399264,"Background The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is a promising new target in cancer therapy and selective Hsp90 inhibitors are currently in clinical trials. Previously these inhibitors have been reported to induce either cell cycle arrest or cell death in cancer cells. Whether the cell cycle arrest is reversible or irreversible has not generally been assessed. Here we have examined in detail the cell cycle arrest and cell death responses of human small cell lung cancer cell lines to Hsp90 inhibition. Methodology/Principal Findings In MTT assays, small cell lung cancer cells showed a biphasic response to the Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin and radicicol, with low concentrations causing proliferation arrest and high concentrations causing cell death. Assessment of Hsp90 intracellular activity using loss of client protein expression showed that geldanamycin concentrations that inhibited Hsp90 correlated closely with those causing proliferation arrest but not cell death. The proliferation arrest induced by low concentrations of geldanamycin was not reversed for a period of over thirty days following drug removal and showed features of senescence. Rare populations of variant small cell lung cancer cells could be isolated that had additional genetic alterations and no longer underwent irreversible proliferation arrest in response to Hsp90 inhibitors. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that: (1) Hsp90 inhibition primarily induces premature senescence, rather than cell death, in small cell lung cancer cells; (2) small cell lung cancer cells can bypass this senescence through further genetic alterations; (3) Hsp90 inhibitor-induced cell death in small cell lung cancer cells is due to inhibition of a target other than cytosolic Hsp90. These results have implications with regard to how these inhibitors will behave in clinical trials and for the design of future inhibitors in this class."
https://openalex.org/W2078119313,"The objective of this study was to identify the role of individual amino acid residues in determining the substrate specificity of the yeast mitochondrial citrate transport protein (CTP). Previously, we showed that the CTP contains at least two substrate-binding sites. In this study, utilizing the overexpressed, single-Cys CTP-binding site variants that were functionally reconstituted in liposomes, we examined CTP specificity from both its external and internal surfaces. Upon mutation of residues comprising the more external site, the CTP becomes less selective for citrate with numerous external anions able to effectively inhibit [(14)C]citrate/citrate exchange. Thus, the site 1 variants assume the binding characteristics of a nonspecific anion carrier. Comparison of [(14)C]citrate uptake in the presence of various internal anions versus water revealed that, with the exception of the R189C mutant, the other site 1 variants showed substantial uniport activity relative to exchange. Upon mutation of residues comprising site 2, we observed two types of effects. The K37C mutant displayed a markedly enhanced selectivity for external citrate. In contrast, the other site 2 mutants displayed varying degrees of relaxed selectivity for external citrate. Examination of internal substrates revealed that, in contrast to the control transporter, the R181C variant exclusively functioned as a uniporter. This study provides the first functional information on the role of specific binding site residues in determining mitochondrial transporter substrate selectivity. We interpret our findings in the context of our homology-modeled CTP as it cycles between the outward-facing, occluded, and inward-facing states."
https://openalex.org/W1974748953,"In a tritrophic system formed by a plant, an herbivore and a natural enemy, each component has its own biological rhythm. However, the rhythm correlations among the three levels and the underlying mechanisms in any tritrophic system are largely unknown. Here, we report that the rhythms exhibited bidirectional correlations in a model tritrophic system involving a lima bean, a pea leafminer and a parasitoid. From the bottom-up perspective, the rhythm was initiated from herbivore feeding, which triggered the rhythms of volatile emissions; then the rhythmic pattern of parasitoid activities was affected, and these rhythms were synchronized by a light switch signal. Increased volatile concentration can enhance the intensity of parasitoid locomotion and oviposition only under light. From the top-down perspective, naive and oviposition-experienced parasitoids were able to utilize the different volatile rhythm information from the damaged plant to locate host leafminers respectively. Our results indicated that the three interacting organisms in this system can achieve rhythmic functional synchronization under a natural light-dark photoperiod, but not under constant light or darkness. These findings provide new insight into the rhythm synchronization of three key players that contribute to the utilization of light and chemical signals, and our results may be used as potential approaches for manipulating natural enemies."
https://openalex.org/W2032605405,"Although viral RNA constitutes the majority of nucleic acids packaged in virions, a late occurring step of reverse transcription leads to the presence of infectious viral cDNA in foamy virus particles. This peculiarity distinguishes them from the rest of the retroviral family.To evaluate the respective contribution of these viral nucleic acids in the replication of foamy viruses, their fate was studied by real-time PCR and RT-PCR early after infection, in the presence or in the absence of AZT. We found that an early reverse transcription step, which occurs during the first hours post-entry, is absolutely required for productive infection. Remarkably, sensitivity to AZT can be counteracted by increasing the multiplicity of infection (moi). We also show that 2-LTR circular viral DNA, which appears as soon as four hours post-infection, is transcriptionally competent.Taken together, our data demonstrate that an early reverse transcription process, which takes place soon after viral entry, is indispensable for infectivity of FVs at low moi, when the amount of DNA-containing particles is not sufficient to lead to a productive infection. This study demonstrates a key role of the packaged viral RNA in the foamy virus infection, suggesting that the replication of this virus can be achieved by involving either viral DNA or RNA genome, depending on the condition of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2047604082,"The density of hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles circulating in the blood of chronically infected patients and of cell-culture produced HCV is heterogeneous. Specific infectivity and fusion of low density particles are higher than those of high density particles. We recently characterized hybrid particles produced by Caco-2 colon or Huh-7.5 liver cells transduced with HCV E1 and E2 envelope glycoproteins. Caco-2-derived particles, called empty lipo-viral particles (eLVP), are composed of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins positive for apolipoproteins B (i.e. apoB100 and apoB48) and contain HCV E1 and E2. Here we aimed at characterizing the morphology and in vitro fusion properties of eLVP using electron microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. They displayed the aspect of beta-lipoproteins, and immunogold labeling confirmed the presence of apoB and HCV E1 and E2 at their surface. These particles are able to fuse with lipid bilayers (liposomes) in a fusion process leading to the coalescence of internal contents of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins particles and liposomes. Fusion was pH-dependent and could be inhibited by either Z-fFG, a peptide known to inhibit viral fusion, or by monoclonal antibodies directed against HCV E2 or the apolipoprotein moiety of the hybrid particle. Interestingly, particles derived from Huh-7.5 cells failed to display equivalent efficient fusion. Optimal fusion activity is, thus, observed when HCV envelope proteins are associated to apoB-positive hybrid particles. Our results, therefore, point to a crucial role of the E1 and E2 proteins in HCV fusion with a subtle interplay with the apolipoprotein part of eLVP."
https://openalex.org/W2066347599,"Background Asthma is a disease that affects all ages, races and ethnic groups. Its incidence is increasing both in Westernized countries and underdeveloped countries. It involves inflammation, genetics and environment and therefore, proteins that exacerbate the asthmatic, allergic phenotype are important. Our laboratory purified and cloned a histamine releasing factor (HRF) that was a complete stimulus for histamine and IL-4 secretion from a subpopulation of allergic donors' basophils. Throughout the course of studying HRF, it was uncovered that HRF enhances or primes histamine release and IL-13 production from all anti-IgE antibody stimulated basophils. In order to further delineate the biology of HRF, we generated a mouse model. Methodology/Principal Findings We constructed an inducible transgenic mouse model with HRF targeted to lung epithelial cells, via the Clara cells. In antigen naïve mice, overproduction of HRF yielded increases in BAL macrophages and statistical increases in mRNA levels for MCP-1 in the HRF transgenic mice compared to littermate controls. In addition to demonstrating intracellular HRF in the lung epithelial cells, we have also been able to document HRF's presence extracellularly in the BAL fluid of these transgenic mice. Furthermore, in the OVA challenged model, we show that HRF exacerbates the allergic, asthmatic responses. We found statistically significant increases in serum and BAL IgE, IL-4 protein and eosinophils in transgenic mice compared to controls. Conclusions/Significance This mouse model demonstrates that HRF expression enhances allergic, asthmatic inflammation and can now be used as a tool to further dissect the biology of HRF."
https://openalex.org/W2045270235,"This paper introduces a new model of associative memory, capable of both binary and continuous-valued inputs. Based on kernel theory, the memory model is on one hand a generalization of Radial Basis Function networks and, on the other, is in feature space, analogous to a Hopfield network. Attractors can be added, deleted, and updated on-line simply, without harming existing memories, and the number of attractors is independent of input dimension. Input vectors do not have to adhere to a fixed or bounded dimensionality; they can increase and decrease it without relearning previous memories. A memory consolidation process enables the network to generalize concepts and form clusters of input data, which outperforms many unsupervised clustering techniques; this process is demonstrated on handwritten digits from MNIST. Another process, reminiscent of memory reconsolidation is introduced, in which existing memories are refreshed and tuned with new inputs; this process is demonstrated on series of morphed faces."
https://openalex.org/W2036384593,"The important human pathogen Candida albicans possesses an unusual form of gene regulation, in which the copy number of an entire specific chromosome or a large portion of a specific chromosome changes in response to a specific adverse environment, thus, insuring survival. In the absence of the adverse environment, the altered portion of the genome can be restored to its normal condition. One major question is how C. albicans copes with gene imbalance arising by transitory aneuploid states. Here, we compared transcriptomes from cells with either two copies or one copy of chromosome 5 (Ch5) in, respectively, a diploid strain 3153A and its representative derivative Sor55. Statistical analyses revealed that at least 40% of transcripts from the monosomic Ch5 are fully compensated to a disomic level, thus, indicating the existence of a genome-wide mechanism maintaining cellular homeostasis. Only approximately 15% of transcripts were diminished twofold in accordance with what would be expected for Ch5 monosomy. Another minor portion of approximately 6% of transcripts, unexpectedly, increased up to twofold and higher than the disomic level, demonstrating indirect control by monosomy. Array comparative genome hybridization revealed that only few out of approximately 500 genes on the monosomic Ch5b were duplicated, thus, not causing a global up regulation. Dosage compensation was confirmed with several representative genes from another monosomic Ch5a in the mutant Sor60. We suggest that C. albicans's unusual regulation of gene expression by the loss and gain of entire chromosomes is coupled with widespread compensation of gene dosage at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2171925627,"Background Susceptibility and resistance to trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness, have been associated with a range of host genetic factors. In vitro studies of the causative organism, Chlamydia trachomatis, demonstrate that iron availability regulates its growth, suggesting that host genes involved in regulating iron status and/or availability may modulate the risk of trachoma. The objective was to investigate whether haptoglobin (Hp) haplotypes constructed from the functional polymorphism (Hp1/Hp2) plus the functional promoter SNPs -61A-C (rs5471) and -101C-G (rs5470), or sickle cell trait (HbAS, rs334) were associated with risk of active trachoma when stratified by age and sex, in rural Gambian children. Methodology and Principal Findings In two cross sectional surveys of children aged 6–78 months (n = 836), the prevalence of the clinical signs of active trachoma was 21.4%. Within boys, haplotype E (-101G, -61A, Hp1), containing the variant allele of the -101C-G promoter SNP, was associated with a two-fold increased risk of active trachoma (OR = 2.0 [1.17–3.44]). Within girls, an opposite association was non-significant (OR = 0.58 [0.32–1.04]; P = 0.07) and the interaction by sex was statistically significant (P = 0.001). There was no association between trachoma and HbAS. Conclusions These data indicate that genetic variation in Hp may affect susceptibility to active trachoma differentially by sex in The Gambia."
https://openalex.org/W2020637984,"The narrow species tropisms of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and the Kaposi's Sarcoma -associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) have made Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) an important tool for understanding how gammaherpesviruses colonize their hosts. However, while MuHV-4 pathogenesis studies can assign a quantitative importance to individual genes, the complexity of in vivo infection can make the underlying mechanisms hard to discern. Furthermore, the lack of good in vitro MuHV-4 latency/reactivation systems with which to dissect mechanisms at the cellular level has made some parallels with EBV and KSHV hard to draw. Here we achieved control of the MuHV-4 lytic/latent switch in vitro by modifying the 5′ untranslated region of its major lytic transactivator gene, ORF50. We terminated normal ORF50 transcripts by inserting a polyadenylation signal and transcribed ORF50 instead from a down-stream, doxycycline-inducible promoter. In this way we could establish fibroblast clones that maintained latent MuHV-4 episomes without detectable lytic replication. Productive virus reactivation was then induced with doxycycline. We used this system to show that the MuHV-4 K3 gene plays a significant role in protecting reactivating cells against CD8+ T cell recognition."
