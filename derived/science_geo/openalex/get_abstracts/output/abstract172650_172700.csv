https://openalex.org/W2156382695,Bacterial biofilms are structured communities of cells enclosed in self-produced hydrated polymeric matrix adherent to an inert or living surface ([1][1]). Formation of these sessile communities and their inherent resistance to antibiotics and host immune attack are at the root of many persistent
https://openalex.org/W2116402707,"We have sequenced and annotated the genome of fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), which contains the smallest number of protein-coding genes yet recorded for a eukaryote: 4,824. The centromeres are between 35 and 110 kilobases (kb) and contain related repeats including a highly conserved 1.8-kb element. Regions upstream of genes are longer than in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), possibly reflecting more-extended control regions. Some 43% of the genes contain introns, of which there are 4,730. Fifty genes have significant similarity with human disease genes; half of these are cancer related. We identify highly conserved genes important for eukaryotic cell organization including those required for the cytoskeleton, compartmentation, cell-cycle control, proteolysis, protein phosphorylation and RNA splicing. These genes may have originated with the appearance of eukaryotic life. Few similarly conserved genes that are important for multicellular organization were identified, suggesting that the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes required more new genes than did the transition from unicellular to multicellular organization."

Emission was tunable from 1 to 1.3 micrometers--a range that effectively covers the short-wavelength telecommunications band--by means of the quantum confinement effects in the nanocrystals. The external efficiency value (photons out divided by electrons in) is approximately 0.5% (that is, >1% internal) and is mainly limited by device architecture. The near-infrared emission did not overlap the charge-induced absorption bands of the polymer."

Here, we present structural, energetic, and mutational analyses of the complex between the Drosophila HP1 chromodomain and the histone H3 tail with a methyllysine at residue 9, a modification associated with epigenetic silencing. The histone tail inserts as a beta strand, completing the beta-sandwich architecture of the chromodomain. The methylammonium group is caged by three aromatic side chains, whereas adjacent residues form discerning contacts with one face of the chromodomain. Comparison of dimethyl- and trimethyllysine-containing complexes suggests a role for cation-pi and van der Waals interactions, with trimethylation slightly improving the binding affinity."

https://openalex.org/W2028968136,"The area of contact between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell (APC) is known as the immunological synapse. Although its exact function is unknown, one model suggests that it allows for T cell receptor (TCR) clustering and for sustained signaling in T cells for many hours. Here we demonstrate that TCR-mediated tyrosine kinase signaling in naïve T cells occurred primarily at the periphery of the synapse and was largely abated before mature immunological synapses had formed. These data suggest that many hours of TCR signaling are not required for T cell activation. These observations challenge current ideas about the role of immunological synapses in T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2066961392,"Internal protein dynamics are intimately connected to enzymatic catalysis. However, enzyme motions linked to substrate turnover remain largely unknown. We have studied dynamics of an enzyme during catalysis at atomic resolution using nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation methods. During catalytic action of the enzyme cyclophilin A, we detect conformational fluctuations of the active site that occur on a time scale of hundreds of microseconds. The rates of conformational dynamics of the enzyme strongly correlate with the microscopic rates of substrate turnover. The present results, together with available structural data, allow a prediction of the reaction trajectory."

https://openalex.org/W2021528024,"A general allometric model has been derived to predict intraspecific and interspecific scaling relationships among seed plant leaf, stem, and root biomass. Analysis of a large compendium of standing organ biomass sampled across a broad sampling of taxa inhabiting diverse ecological habitats supports the relations predicted by the model and defines the boundary conditions for above- and below-ground biomass partitioning. These canonical biomass relations are insensitive to phyletic affiliation (conifers versus angiosperms) and variation in averaged local environmental conditions. The model thus identifies and defines the limits that have guided the diversification of seed plant biomass allocation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2087025419,"Stereochemistry plays a central role in controlling molecular recognition and interaction: the chemical and biological properties of molecules depend not only on the nature of their constituent atoms but also on how these atoms are positioned in space. Chiral specificity is consequently fundamental in chemical biology and pharmacology and has accordingly been widely studied. Advances in scanning probe microscopies now make it possible to probe chiral phenomena at surfaces at the molecular level. These methods have been used to determine the chirality of adsorbed molecules, and to provide direct evidence for chiral discrimination in molecular interactions and the spontaneous resolution of adsorbates into extended enantiomerically pure overlayers. Here we report scanning tunnelling microscopy studies of cysteine adsorbed to a (110) gold surface, which show that molecular pairs formed from a racemic mixture of this naturally occurring amino acid are exclusively homochiral, and that their binding to the gold surface is associated with local surface restructuring. Density-functional theory calculations indicate that the chiral specificity of the dimer formation process is driven by the optimization of three bonds on each cysteine molecule. These findings thus provide a clear molecular-level illustration of the well known three-point contact model for chiral recognition in a simple bimolecular system."

Sheep, mice, cattle, goats and pigs have all been cloned by transfer of a donor cell nucleus into an enucleated ovum1,2,3,4,5, and now we add the successful cloning of a cat (Felis domesticus) to this list. However, this cloning technology may not be readily extendable to other mammalian species if our understanding of their reproductive processes is limited or if there are species-specific obstacles."
https://openalex.org/W2032407294,"The public health and economic consequences of Plasmodium falciparum malaria are once again regarded as priorities for global development. There has been much speculation on whether anthropogenic climate change is exacerbating the malaria problem, especially in areas of high altitude where P. falciparum transmission is limited by low temperature. The International Panel on Climate Change has concluded that there is likely to be a net extension in the distribution of malaria and an increase in incidence within this range. We investigated long-term meteorological trends in four high-altitude sites in East Africa, where increases in malaria have been reported in the past two decades. Here we show that temperature, rainfall, vapour pressure and the number of months suitable for P. falciparum transmission have not changed significantly during the past century or during the period of reported malaria resurgence. A high degree of temporal and spatial variation in the climate of East Africa suggests further that claimed associations between local malaria resurgences and regional changes in climate are overly simplistic."
https://openalex.org/W2080237506,"The p53 tumor suppressor gene is inactivated in the majority of human cancers. Tumor cells deficient in p53 display a diminished rate of apoptosis under hypoxic conditions, a circumstance that might reduce their reliance on vascular supply, and hence their responsiveness to antiangiogenic therapy. Here, we report that mice bearing tumors derived from p53(-/-) HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells were less responsive to antiangiogenic combination therapy than mice bearing isogenic p53(+/+) tumors. Thus, although antiangiogenic therapy targets genetically stable endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature, genetic alterations that decrease the vascular dependence of tumor cells can influence the therapeutic response of tumors to this therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1988402356,"Isolable quantities of C60, the smallest stable fullerene, have been synthesized in 12 steps from commercially available starting materials by rational chemical methods. A molecular polycyclic aromatic precursor bearing chlorine substituents at key positions forms C60 when subjected to flash vacuum pyrolysis at 1100 degrees C. No other fullerenes are formed as by-products. The methods we have developed for the target-specific synthesis of fullerenes, applied here to a synthesis of C60, should make possible the directed laboratory preparation of other fullerenes as well, including those not accessible by graphite vaporization."
https://openalex.org/W2037590760,"Large mammalian herbivores occupy half of the earth's land surface and are important both ecologically and economically, but their diversity is threatened by human activities. We investigated how the diversity of large herbivores changes across gradients of global precipitation and soil fertility. Here we show that more plant-available moisture reduces the nutrient content of plants but increases productivity, whereas more plant-available nutrients increase both of these factors. Because larger herbivore species tolerate lower plant nutrient content but require greater plant abundance, the highest potential herbivore diversity should occur in locations with intermediate moisture and high nutrients. These areas are dry enough to yield high quality plants and support smaller herbivores, but productive enough to support larger herbivores. These predictions fit with observed patterns of body size and diversity for large mammalian herbivores in North America, Africa and Australia, and yield a global map of regions with potentially high herbivore diversity. Thus, gradients of precipitation, temperature and soil fertility might explain the global distribution of large herbivore diversity and help to identify crucial areas for conservation and restoration."

https://openalex.org/W2038006301,"A 420-year history of strontium/calcium, uranium/calcium, and oxygen isotope ratios in eight coral cores from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, indicates that sea surface temperature and salinity were higher in the 18th century than in the 20th century. An abrupt freshening after 1870 occurred simultaneously throughout the southwestern Pacific, coinciding with cooling tropical temperatures. Higher salinities between 1565 and 1870 are best explained by a combination of advection and wind-induced evaporation resulting from a strong latitudinal temperature gradient and intensified circulation. The global Little Ice Age glacial expansion may have been driven, in part, by greater poleward transport of water vapor from the tropical Pacific."

In this report, we identify a component of the regulation of Cdk5-mediated cortical lamination by genetic analysis of the roles of the class III POU domain transcription factors, Brn-1 and Brn-2, expressed during the development of the forebrain and coexpressed in most layer II-V cortical neurons. Brn-1 and Brn-2 appear to critically control the initiation of radial migration, redundantly regulating the cell-autonomous expression of the p35 and p39 regulatory subunits of Cdk5 in migrating cortical neurons, with Brn-1(-/-)/Brn-2(-/-) mice exhibiting cortical inversion."

https://openalex.org/W2069128133,"Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous protozoan parasite that is responsible for severe congenital birth defects and fatal toxoplasmic encephalitis in immunocompromized people. Fundamental aspects of obligate intracellular replication and pathogenesis are only now beginning to emerge for protozoan parasites. T. gondii has a fragmented pathway for salvaging pyrimidine nucleobases derived from the parasite or host cell, and this limited pyrimidine salvage capacity is funnelled exclusively through uracil phosphoribosyltransferase. Disrupting the function of this enzyme does not affect the growth of T. gondii tachyzoites, which suggests that the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway may be necessary for growth. We have examined the virulence of T. gondii mutants that lack carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (uracil auxotrophs) to determine whether de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is required in vivo. Here we show that T. gondii uracil auxotrophs are completely avirulent not only in immune-competent BALB/c mice but also in mice that lack interferon-gamma. A single injection of the uracil auxotroph into BALB/c mice induces long-term protective immunity to toxoplasmosis. Our findings indicate the significance of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway for the virulence of parasitic protozoa, and suggest routes for developing vaccines and chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2093633691,"The RCS rat is a widely studied model of recessively inherited retinal degeneration. The genetic defect, known as rdy (retinal dystrophy), results in failure of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to phagocytize shed photoreceptor outer segment membranes. We previously used positional cloning andin vivo genetic complementation to demonstrate thatMertk is the gene for rdy. We have now used a rat primary RPE cell culture system to demonstrate that the RPE is the site of action of Mertk and to obtain functional evidence for a key role of Mertk in RPE phagocytosis. We found that Mertk protein is absent from RCS, but not wild-type, tissues and cultured RPE cells. Delivery of rat Mertk to cultured RCS RPE cells by means of a recombinant adenovirus restored the cells to complete phagocytic competency. Infected RCS RPE cells ingested exogenous outer segments to the same extent as wild-type RPE cells, but outer segment binding was unaffected. Mertk protein progressively co-localized with outer segment material during phagocytosis by primary RPE cells, and activated Mertk accumulated during the early stages of phagocytosis by RPE-J cells.

Phagocytosis is a process by which large particles are internalized by cells to form phagosomes. The process can be divided into three phases: binding, ingestion, and digestion.

Young R.W. Zinn K.E. Marmor M.F. The Retinal Pigment Epithelium. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1979: 148-174Google Scholar). The RPE phagocytizes photoreceptor outer segment (OS) membranes (2.Young R.W. Bok D. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 42: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) that are shed as part of the normal ongoing process of photoreceptor OS renewal (3.Young R.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

The RCS mutation rdy (retinal dystrophy) causes, either directly or indirectly, a defect in RPE phagocytosis (4.Bok D. Hall M.O. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 49: 664-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This defect leads to an accumulation of shed OS membranes in the subretinal space (4.Bok D. Hall M.O. J.

Studies of the internalization of exogenous OS by cultured primary RPE cells suggested a receptor-mediated process (6.Mayerson P.L. Hall M.O. J.

Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1988; 29: 419-428PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the RPE cell culture phagocytic assay by anti-receptor antibodies or competitive ligands suggested several specific proteins that might play a role in the process, including the mannose receptor (9.Boyle D. Tien L.F. Cooper N.G. Shepherd V. McLaughlin B.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 1464-1470PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Shepherd V.L. Tarnowski B.I. McLaughlin B.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 1779-1784PubMed Google Scholar), CD36 (11.Ryeom S.W. Sparrow J.R. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and αvβ5 integrin (12.Finnemann S.C. Bonilha V.L. Marmorstein A.D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12932-12937Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 13.Miceli M.V. Newsome D.A. Tate Jr., D.J.

Inhibition of αvβ5 integrin function disrupts the OS binding phase of RPE phagocytosis, whereas the mannose receptor and CD36 have been implicated in both OS binding and ingestion. Cultured RCS RPE cells bind exogenous OS at wild-type levels. However, only a small percentage of bound OS are ingested by RCS RPE cells (15.Chaitin M.H. Hall M.O. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1983; 24: 812-820PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the protein encoded by therdy locus is critical, directly or indirectly, for OS uptake. The gene corresponding to rdy remained unknown until recently. The mannose receptor protein and messenger RNA are present in the RPE of both wild-type and RCS rats from postnatal day (P) 5 to adult (16.Wilt S.D. Greaton C.J. Lutz D.A. McLaughlin B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). CD36 null mice have been reported to have normal electroretinography and retinal histology (17.Silverstein R.L. Sparrow J.R. Ryeom S.W. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 534Google Scholar). These data suggest that neither the mannose receptor nor CD36 is the gene mutated in the RCS rat. We used positional cloning to identify a mutation in the receptor tyrosine kinase gene Mertk in the RCS rat. A deletion of RCS genomic DNA results in expression of an aberrant Mertktranscript with a translation termination signal after codon 20 (18), likely a complete loss-of-function, or null, allele. Mertkwas an appropriate candidate for rdy in light of evidence that a signaling defect might underlie the RCS RPE phagocytic phenotype (19.Chaitin M.H. Hall M.O. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1983; 24: 821-831PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Heth C.A. Schmidt S.Y. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 2839-2847PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Heth C.A. Marescalchi P.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 409-416PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery of mutations in the human ortholog,MERTK, in individuals with retinitis pigmentosa indicated that Mertk is essential for maintenance of the mammalian retina (22.Gal A. Li Y. Thompson D.A. Weir J. Orth U. Jacobson S.G. Apfelstedt-Sylla E. Vollrath D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 270-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Subsequently, in vivo genetic complementation of the RCS phenotype by viral mediated gene transfer conclusively demonstrated that Mertk is the gene for rdy(23.Vollrath D. Feng W. Duncan J. Yasumura D. D'Cruz P.M. Chappelow A. Matthes M.T. Kay M.A. LaVail M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12584-12589Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The identification of Mertk provides an initial focus for elucidating molecular mechanisms of RPE phagocytosis. In the present study, we sought to determine whether the site of action ofMertk was indeed the RPE, as suggested by genetic chimera experiments (24.Mullen R.J. LaVail M.M. Science. 1976; 192: 799-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and, if so, whether Mertk protein was directly involved in the ingestion step of OS phagocytosis. We tested whether viral mediated gene transfer of Mertk to cultured RCS RPE cells could complement their ingestion defect. We also generated a polyclonal antibody directed against rat Mertk and used it to examine the activation state and subcellular localization of the receptor over a time course of OS phagocytosis by cultured RPE cells. All tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Primary RPE cells were isolated essentially as described (25.Chang C.W. Roque R.S. Defoe D.M. Caldwell R.B. Curr. Eye Res. 1991; 10: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) from pigmented RCS-p + and wild-type congenic RCS-rdy+p+ rats at P6 to P9. The RPE cells were plated on 4-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) for phagocytic assays or on cell culture dishes (Corning Glass) for protein studies. The cultures were maintained in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and used after the cells grew confluent. OS were isolated from P30 Sprague-Dawley rats (Simonsen Laboratories, Gilroy, CA) as described (15.Chaitin M.H. Hall M.O. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1983; 24: 812-820PubMed Google Scholar), and the purified OS were stored in 1× BSS (10 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 5.36 mm KCl, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.81 mmMgSO4, 1.27 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) containing 5% sucrose at −80 °C. All animal procedures adhered to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Resolution on the Use of Animals in Research. The rat RPE cell line RPE-J and the rat kidney fibroblast cell line NRK-49F were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. RPE-J cells were cultured as described (26.Nabi I.R. Mathews A.P. Cohen-Gould L. Gundersen D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 37-49PubMed Google Scholar), and NRK-49F cells were maintained as recommended by the company. A DNA fragment encoding the 103 C-terminal amino acids of rat Mertk was inserted into pGEX-1 (AMRAD Corp. Ltd., Australia) and transformed into bacterial strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to produce a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The fusion protein was purified from crude bacterial lysate by affinity chromatography on immobilized glutathione (Sigma) and injected into rabbits to generate polyclonal antibodies. A recombinant adenovirus containing the complete open reading frame of rat Mertk driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter was constructed as described (23.Vollrath D. Feng W. Duncan J. Yasumura D. D'Cruz P.M. Chappelow A. Matthes M.T. Kay M.A. LaVail M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12584-12589Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To deliver Mertk into RPE cells, Ad-Mertk was added to confluent RPE cultures at various multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) and incubated for 42 h at 37 °C. A recombinant Ad-GFP (a gift from Dr. Yongjian Wu, Stanford University) was used as a control. RPE-J cells were grown on Matrigel (Fisher) for 6 days and then infected with Ad-Mertkat an m.o.i. of 2 for 42 h at 32 °C. NRK-49F cells were incubated with Ad-Mertk or Ad-GFP at an m.o.i. of 10 for 42 h at 37 °C. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-enriched samples, deglycosylated samples, immunoprecipitation samples, and whole cell lysates were separated by 6 or 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Fisher). Mertk protein was detected by the C-terminal polyclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate system (Pierce). Pre-immune serum was used as a negative control. A polyclonal antibody directed against the ectodomain of murine Mertk (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), which cross-reacts weakly with rat Mertk, was also used for immunoblotting (1:100 dilution). Tyrosine-phosphorylated Mertk was detected in immunoprecipitation samples by immunoblot with an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (P-Tyr-100, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Neural retina, RPE/sclera, brain, and kidney were dissected from RCS-p+ and wild-type RCS-rdy+p+ rats at P23–P26 and homogenized in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Equivalent growth areas of wild-type and mutant rat primary RPE cultures were washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer on ice for 20 min before cell lysates were collected. Tissue homogenates and cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a Sorvall Microspin 24S centrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and incubated with WGA-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were washed five times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and glycoproteins were dissociated from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 2× loading buffer (0.125m Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mdithiothreitol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8). Glycoproteins enriched with WGA beads were dissociated from the beads in 1× denaturing buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and treated according to the manufacturer's instructions with either PNGase F (New England Biolabs), to remove all forms of the N-linked oligosaccharides, or with Endo H (New England Biolabs), to cleave the chitobiose core of high mannose and hybrid form of N-linked oligosaccharides. Confluent wild-type primary RPE cells were washed with DMEM and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cell membranes were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and cells were incubated for 30 min with fluorescein phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to detect F-actin by fluorescence microscopy. The ability of RPE cells to phagocytize OS was measured as reported previously (27.Feng W. Lutz D.A. McLaughlin B.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 378Google Scholar). OS were suspended in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% sucrose at a concentration of 1 × 107 OS per ml. One ml of OS was added to each well of a 4-well chamber slide and incubated with adenovirus-infected or uninfected cells for 4 h at 37 °C. Then unbound OS were washed away with DMEM, and cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm,KH2PO4, pH 7.4). To distinguish total and bound OS, samples were divided into two groups. Each group contained 2 wells of cells. Group 1 was permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and group 2 remained unpermeabilized. OS were immunolabeled with anti-rhodopsin monoclonal antibody Rho 4D2 (8.Laird D.W. Molday R.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1988; 29: 419-428PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Robert S. Molday), followed by a Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Fluorescent labeling was observed under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope, and images were taken from 10–15 random fields (0.036 mm2 per field) for each group. OS with an estimated diameter of 1 μm or larger were manually counted. The total number of OS (bound plus ingested) was obtained from group 1 samples, and the number of bound OS was obtained from group 2 samples. The number of ingested OS was obtained by subtracting bound OS from total OS. For each experimental condition, the assay was repeated at least three times. Results for each condition were presented as a means ± S.E. A Student's t test was used for statistical evaluation. Confluent wild-type primary RPE cells were incubated with OS for 1–3 h, and unbound OS were removed by washing with DMEM. Cells were fixed in 100% ethanol for 5 min at −20 °C. Localization of the remaining OS and Mertk was examined by immunolabeling with the Rho 4D2 (1:100) and the C-terminal antibody (1:100) followed by Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Oregon Green-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). RPE-J cells were incubated with OS (3 × 107 per ml) or control medium for 1–3 h at 32 °C. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0) containing 10 mm sodium orthovanadate and the protease inhibitor mixture. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with 20 μl of the Mertk C-terminal antiserum overnight at 4 °C. The antigen-antibody complex was precipitated by protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences AB), and proteins were dissociated from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 2× loading buffer. Our molecular genetic data predict that only a 20-amino acid N-terminal peptide of Mertk can be synthesized in the RCS rat (18.D'Cruz P.M. Yasumura D. Weir J. Matthes M.T. Abderrahim H. LaVail M.M. Vollrath D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that most or all of the protein is missing from RCS tissues. To test this prediction, we generated a polyclonal antibody directed against the C terminus of rat Mertk and assessed its specificity by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1 A, anti-Mertk recognized two bands of ∼200 and 150 kDa from rat kidney fibroblasts infected with a recombinant adenovirus, Ad-Mertk, which expresses ratMertk (23.Vollrath D. Feng W. Duncan J. Yasumura D. D'Cruz P.M. Chappelow A. Matthes M.T. Kay M.A. LaVail M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12584-12589Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These bands were absent from Ad-GFP-infected or uninfected cells, indicating that the antibody specifically recognizes Mertk. Pre-immune serum did not detect bands in any of the samples (data not shown). The C-terminal antibody was used to assess Mertk expression in primary RPE cultures from RCS or a wild-type, congenic strain, RCS-rdy +. As expected, anti-Mertk recognized a single band of about 200 kDa from wild-type RPE cells but not from RCS RPE cells (Fig. 1 B). We next used the C-terminal antibody and a polyclonal antiserum that reacts with the Mertk ectodomain to examine various RCS and wild-type RCS-rdy +tissues including neural retina, RPE/sclera, brain, and kidney (Fig. 2). The C-terminal antibody (Fig. 2 A) recognized an ∼190-kDa band from each of the four wild-type tissues tested, as well as smaller bands from wild-type neural retina (∼160 kDa) and brain (∼150 kDa). None of these bands was present in any of the RCS samples. The ectodomain antibody (Fig. 2 B) recognized the same Mertk bands as the C-terminal antibody in wild-type tissues, although with lower avidity. The primary amino acid sequence of Mertk predicts a protein of about 107 kDa, significantly smaller than the proteins we detected. There are 14 putative N-linked glycosylation sites in the ectodomain of rat Mertk (GenBank™ accession number P57097), and evidence indicates that human MERTK from embryonic kidney cells is about 200 kDa in size (28.Chen J. Carey K. Godowski P.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2033-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), consistent with our data. To determine whether the different protein bands we detected with anti-Mertk are due to differential glycosylation, WGA-enriched protein samples were digested with the deglycosylase, PNGase F. After PNGase F treatment, the 150–200-kDa bands disappeared, and a new band of about 120 kDa was detected by the C-terminal antibody (Fig. 3 A). The size of the new band is slightly larger than the predicted size of rat Mertk. These results indicate that rat Mertk exists in at least two glycosylated forms. To determine which of these forms are mature proteins, WGA-enriched proteins from brain were treated with Endo H. In the early steps of N-linked oligosaccharide processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, oligosaccharides are Endo H-sensitive until Golgi mannosidase II removes the last two mannose residues from the final core of three residues present in a complex oligosaccharide (29.Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1994: 604-605Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B (lanes 1 and 2), the 190-kDa band remained intact after digestion with Endo H, indicating that the band corresponds to a mature form of Mertk. By contrast, Endo H treatment resulted in disappearance of the 150-kDa band and appearance of a smaller band (lane 2). The size of the new band was greater than that of the band produced by PNGase F treatment (compare lanes 2and 3). Extended Endo H treatment did not further reduce the size of the new band. The partial Endo H sensitivity of the 150-kDa protein indicates that it contains both complex and high mannose forms of N-linked oligosaccharides. After demonstrating that RCS RPE lacked Mertk protein, we sought to determine whether transfer of the gene to RCS RPE would complement the well described OS phagocytic defect in primary cell culture. Rat RPE cells in culture form a monolayer with polygonal cell morphology (Fig. 4 A). We chose Ad-Mertk as the means of delivering the gene to these cells because earlier studies had demonstrated that adenovirus efficiently infects primary RCS RPE (30.da Cruz L. Robertson T. Hall M.O. Constable I.J. Rakoczy P.E. Curr. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 668-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, when RCS RPE cells were incubated with Ad-GFP at a low m.o.i. of 2, almost all were found to be GFP-positive after 42 h (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, Mertk was delivered into RCS RPE cells with high efficiency by Ad-Mertk; cells infected at increasing m.o.i. values expressed proportionally more Mertk protein (Fig. 4 C). Even at an m.o.i. of 2, infected cells produced more Mertk than wild-type RPE. We assessed the effect of Mertk expression on the phagocytic ability of RCS RPE by a cell culture assay. RPE monolayers were incubated with purified rat OS for 4 h. The cells were then washed, fixed, and either permeabilized with Triton X-100 or not, and OS were detected with a monoclonal antibody directed against rhodopsin to determine the number of bound and ingested OS. Bound and ingested OS in RCS RPE, virus-infected RCS RPE, and wild-type RPE cells were quantified (Fig. 5 A). Consistent with the results of Chaitin and Hall (15.Chaitin M.H. Hall M.O. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1983; 24: 812-820PubMed Google Scholar), RCS RPE cells bound similar numbers of OS as did wild-type RPE (p = 0.70) but could not ingest any of the bound OS. By contrast, wild-type RPE cells ingested 73 ± 8% of total OS. Introduction of Mertk into RCS RPE dramatically altered the difference in OS ingestion between these two types of RPE cells (Fig. 5 A). Infection of RCS RPE by Ad-Mertk at an m.o.i. of 2 caused the infected cells to ingest as many OS as wild-type RPE (p = 0.84). The number of bound OS was not altered in comparison to uninfected RCS (p = 0.47) or wild-type RCS-rdy +cells (p = 0.70). The functional rescue that we observed is specifically due to Mertk because infection with Ad-GFP did not result in an increase in OS ingestion (p = 0.86). Additional Mertk did not increase OS ingestion in wild-type RPE (Fig. 5 A). Cells infected with Ad-Mertk at an m.o.i. of 2 ingested an equal amount of OS as compared with uninfected cells (p = 0.88), despite the higher level of Mertk in virus-infected cells (Fig. 5 B). The slight increase in the number of bound OS (Fig. 5 A) was not significant (p = 0.34). The preceding data demonstrate that the RPE is indeed the site of action of Mertk with respect to OS phagocytosis. To assess whether Mertk is directly involved in OS ingestion, we examined the subcellular localization of the protein during a time course of RPE phagocytosis. Double immunolabeling of uninfected wild-type RPE cells during the first 3 h of phagocytosis revealed progressive co-localization of Mertk with OS (Fig. 6). A small number of OS co-localized with punctate Mertk signals after 1 h of incubation (Fig. 6, A–C, arrowheads). The number OS with accompanying Mertk increased by 2 h (Fig. 6, D–F), and by 3 h, the patterns of OS staining and punctate Mertk staining were almost identical (Fig. 6, G–I). These data indicate that Mertk gradually accumulates around OS with a time course that is similar to the progressive ingestion of OS (7.Hall M.O. Abrams T. Exp. Eye Res. 1987; 45: 907-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15.Chaitin M.H. Hall M.O. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1983; 24: 812-820PubMed Google Scholar). If Mertk is directly involved in OS ingestion, as suggested by the co-localization data, then the receptor should be increasingly activated after addition of OS. To test this hypothesis, we examined the activation state of the receptor by monitoring the extent of phosphorylated tyrosine residues in Mertk during the first 3 h of OS phagocytosis. To obtain a sufficient number of cells, we used RPE-J, a well characterized rat RPE cell line with the ability to phagocytize OS (12.Finnemann S.C. Bonilha V.L. Marmorstein A.D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12932-12937Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 26.Nabi I.R. Mathews A.P. Cohen-Gould L. Gundersen D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 37-49PubMed Google Scholar), and infected them with Ad-Mertk (m.o.i. = 2) to enhance detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor molecules. After 1 h of OS incubation, we did not detect activated Mertk by immunoprecipitation with anti-Mertk and immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Fig. 7). However, after 3 h, two tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of Mertk were readily detected (Fig. 7). Activated Mertk was not observed in the absence of added OS (Fig. 7). A parallel experiment with uninfected RPE-J cells yielded similar results, except the signals were much weaker (data not shown). We have transferred wild-type Mertk to RCS RPE cells, which we showed lacked Mertk protein, and completely corrected the phagocytic defect of the cells. These results definitively establish the RPE as the site of action of Mertk with respect to OS phagocytosis, as suggested previously (24.Mullen R.J. LaVail M.M. Science. 1976; 192: 799-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Moreover, the fact that Ad-Mertk-infected RCS cells bound and ingested OS at wild-type levels demonstrates that the rest of the phagocytic machinery in RCS RPE is normal and that RCS RPE cells have the same potential as wild-type RPE for OS internalization. Reported biochemical abnormalities of RCS RPE, such as increased calcium membrane conductance and altered cAMP and inositol phosphate second messenger metabolism (31.Strauss O. Stumpff F. Mergler S. Wienrich M. Wiederholt M. Acta Anat. 1998; 162: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), are likely secondary to the loss of Mertk function. Mertk did not affect the binding phase of phagocytosis in primary RPE cell culture; modest overexpression of the protein (m.o.i. = 2) in RCS RPE and wild-type RPE cells did not significantly increase OS binding. These results are consistent with previous reports indicating that αvβ5 integrin is a major OS binding receptor for RPE in cell culture (12.Finnemann S.C. Bonilha V.L. Marmorstein A.D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12932-12937Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 14.Lin H. Clegg D.O. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1703-1712PubMed Google Scholar). However, αvβ5 integrin cannot be essential for retinal structure and function because mice with a targeted disruption of the β5 gene have normal retinal anatomy and electroretinography at 1 and 4 months of age, 2J. Duncan, X. Huang, M. M. LaVail, D. Sheppard, and D. Vollrath, unpublished observations. despite the fact that disc shedding and phagocytosis begin around P12. The apparent discrepancy between the role of αvβ5integrin in cell culture and in vivo may result from physical differences in the process of RPE phagocytosis in these two settings. In vivo, OS are closely apposed to RPE microvilli, whereas in cell culture, purified OS are suspended in culture medium and added to cells. Thus, OS binding in cell culture may not be relevant to, or may be substantially different from, the normalin vivo OS phagocytic process. By contrast, Mertk is required for RPE phagocytosis of OS both in vivo (23.Vollrath D. Feng W. Duncan J. Yasumura D. D'Cruz P.M. Chappelow A. Matthes M.T. Kay M.A. LaVail M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12584-12589Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and in cell culture (the present study). We generated a polyclonal antibody suitable for immunoblotting and demonstrated that the antibody specifically recognizes 190–200- and 150–160-kDa forms of Mertk in the RPE and assorted other tissues. These sizes are significantly larger than the molecular weight predicted on the basis of the rat primary amino acid sequence. We found that a large majority of the excess molecular weight is due to the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides and that the two forms arise from differential glycosylation. Both forms of the receptor present in RPE-J cells can be activated by OS (Fig. 7). It therefore appears that both forms are functional and probably localize to the plasma membrane. Mertk appears to be an integral component of the phagocytic machinery. During the early stages of RPE phagocytosis, Mertk progressively co-localized with OS. The time course of co-localization matched that of the activation of Mertk, as measured by tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that a close association with OS may be required to activate the receptor. Because Mertk only stimulated OS internalization and not binding, the protein must be critical for the ingestion phase. The delayed activation of Mertk is consistent with the observed initial delay in the kinetics of OS ingestion by cultured RPE cells (7.Hall M.O. Abrams T. Exp. Eye Res. 1987; 45: 907-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12.Finnemann S.C. Bonilha V.L. Marmorstein A.D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12932-12937Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar,15.Chaitin M.H. Hall M.O. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1983; 24: 812-820PubMed Google Scholar). By 3 h of incubation, however, substantial OS ingestion has occurred (7.Hall M.O. Abrams T. Exp. Eye Res. 1987; 45: 907-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and about 70% of total OS are ingested by 4 h (Fig. 5 A). The fact that nearly all OS were accompanied by punctate Mertk signals at 3 h (Fig. 6) suggests that the receptor becomes internalized with OS as part of the phagosome. Further studies are required to address the turnover of Mertk. The requirement for Mertk in both RPE phagocytosis of OS in the RCS rat and macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in the Merkd mouse (32.Scott R.S. McMahon E.J. Pop S.M. Reap E.A. Caricchio R. Cohen P.L. Earp H.S. Matsushima G.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), combined with the general similarities between RPE phagocytosis and the uptake of apoptotic cells by macrophages and other professional phagocytes, suggests that the two processes may share mechanistic features. Activation of Mertk could trigger an intracellular signaling pathway that controls rearrangement of cytoskeletal components necessary for OS or apoptotic cell ingestion. Phosphotyrosine accumulates within actin cups that form immediately beneath the site of apoptotic cell ingestion during macrophage phagocytosis (33.Leverrier Y. Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 195-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Moreover, apoptotic cell uptake by professional and non-professional phagocytes requires a tyrosine kinase signaling pathway to activate CrkII and Rac (33.Leverrier Y. Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 195-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34.Albert M.L. Kim J.I. Birge R.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). TheCaenorhabditis elegans homologs CED-2 (CrkII) and CED-10 (Rac) are required for engulfment of apoptotic cells, demonstrating an ancient origin to at least part of this pathway (35.Reddien P.W. Horvitz H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway may also be activated during RPE phagocytosis of OS. It is not yet known whether phosphatidylserine plays a key role in the recognition of OS by RPE cells, as it does in the recognition of apoptotic cells by macrophages (36.Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting that annexin V binds avidly to purified rat OS, indicating that phosphatidylserine is exposed on the outside. 3W. Feng and D. Vollrath, unpublished observations.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29411-29414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and may serve as a bridge between OS and Mertk at the RPE plasma membrane during phagocytosis, as we suggested previously (18.D'Cruz P.M.

Consistent with this model, Hall and colleagues (39.Hall M.O. Prieto A.L. Obin M.S. Abrams T.A. Burgess B.L. Heeb M.J. Agnew B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) recently reported that Gas6 stimulates phagocytosis of exogenous OS by rat primary RPE cells. It will be of great interest to determine whether Gas6 plays a key role in RPE phagocytosis and/or internalization of apoptotic cellsin vivo. In summary, we have demonstrated that Mertk is an integral component of the RPE phagocytic process in cell culture, in which it probably functions to trigger ingestion of bound OS. Future studies on the interaction of Mertk with upstream and downstream proteins will help to elaborate the molecular mechanism of RPE phagocytosis. The common requirement for Mertk in uptake of apoptotic cells by professional phagocytes and OS phagocytosis by RPE indicates that elucidation of this mechanism may have general implications.

The presence of two homologous nucleotide binding domains where ATP binding and hydrolysis can occur is the defining feature of these molecules. It is assumed that the energy of ATP binding is used to do the mechanical work of the molecule, in most cases the vectorial translocation of a solute across a biological membrane (4Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar, 5Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J.

In the first, ATP hydrolysis occurs alternatively and in a mutually exclusive fashion at each NBD, to drive solute export (6Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In a second model, hydrolysis at one NBD drives transport whereas that at the second “resets” the protein for the subsequent step (7Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I.

In both of these models, the NBD at which the initial hydrolysis occurs is chosen randomly; the two domains are distinct only temporally. Indeed, in the P-glycoprotein multidrug transporter in which studies supporting each of these models have been performed, the amino acid sequences of the two domains are very similar and only minor functional asymmetry has been observed (8Hrycyna C.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12918-12923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, a non-hydrolyzable analogue, 8-N3AMP-PNP, competed much more strongly for N3ATP binding and capture at NBD1 than at NBD2 (16Aleksandrov L. Mengos A. Chang X. Aleksandrov A. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12918-12923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have now further explored this apparent asymmetry of the domains in photolabeling experiments employing [γ-32P]- as well as [α-32P]8-N3ATP, [α-32P]8-N3ADP, and [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP. The latter compound selectively labeled NBD1. NBD1 could be labeled by each of these compounds in the absence of a divalent cation such as Mg2+. Labeling of NBD2 that occurred only when azido-nucleotides were not washed out prior to photoactivation was Mg2+-dependent. When [γ-32P]8-N3ATP was employed at temperatures and divalent cation concentrations where hydrolysis could occur, only NBD1 was labeled, indicating that the intact nucleoside triphosphate was bound and retained there but not at NBD2. This revealed that the labeling of NBD2 detected with [α-32P]8-N3ATP must have reflected bound [α-32P]8-N3ADP formed by hydrolysis. This hydrolysis must have been rapid and complete because no [γ-32P]8-N3ATP radioactivity could be detected at NBD2. The [α-32P]8-N3ADP bound at NBD2 after presentation of the protein with [α-32P]8-N3ATP could have arisen from hydrolysis at either NBD1 or NBD2. To distinguish between these possibilities, the Walker A lysine mutants K464A and K1250A were used; K464A ablated labeling of NBD1 without influencing that at NBD2, and hence the N3ADP that labeled NBD2 could not have arisen from hydrolysis at NBD1. This implicates NBD2 as a site of rapid hydrolysis, whereas hydrolysis is very limited at NBD1 where there is labeling to a similar extent with [α-32P]- and [γ-32P]8-N3ATP. Not only is hydrolysis at NBD2 rapid but release of the product, N3ADP, is also as it is completely removed by washing away of the free compound prior to photo-activation. In contrast, after incubation with [α-32P]- or [γ-32P]8-N3ATP or [α-32P]8-N3ADP, bound nucleotide is retained at NBD1 to the same extent with or without washout of free azido-nucleotide. [α-32P]8-N3ATP, [γ-32P]8-N3ATP, [α-32P]8-N3ADP, and [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP were obtained from Affinity Labeling Technologies, Inc. Non-radioactively labeled 8-N3AMP-PNP was from the same source; other nucleotides were purchased from Sigma as were other reagents employed, including TPCK-treated trypsin. Stable BHK-21 cell lines expressing wild-type and K464A and K1250A variants of CFTR were established and cultured as described previously (16Aleksandrov L. Mengos A. Chang X. Aleksandrov A.

Membranes for photolabeling experiments were isolated from these cells by methods described previously (16Aleksandrov L. Mengos A. Chang X. Aleksandrov A. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12918-12923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and outlined below for purification of CFTR from them. Photoaffinity labeling of CFTR in BHK membranes with the different 8-azido-nucleotides was carried out exactly as we have described previously for 8-N3[α-32P] ATP (16Aleksandrov L. Mengos A. Chang X. Aleksandrov A. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12918-12923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Membrane suspensions (50–200 μg of protein) were incubated for 10 min with the concentration of 8-azido-nucleotide indicated in the figure legends under the conditions also specified there. The membranes were irradiated directly or pelleted and washed with and resuspended in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA and then irradiated for 2 min on ice in a Stratalinker UV cross-linker (λ = 254 nm). The labeled membranes were incubated with TPCK-treated trypsin for 15 min on ice (enzyme to membrane protein mass ratio of 1:180). After termination of digestion with soybean trypsin inhibitor, the entire mix was solubilized in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 SDS, 150 mm NaCl) and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 596, which recognizes an epitope between residues 1204 and 1211. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets for conventional (x-ray film) and electronic (Packard Instant Imager) autoradiography. Bands corresponding to tryptic fragments containing NBD1 and NBD2 were assigned by Western blots of the same nitrocellulose probed with monoclonal antibodies L12B4 and M3A7 (18Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), as described in detail elsewhere (16Aleksandrov L. Mengos A. Chang X. Aleksandrov A. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12918-12923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A protocol very similar to that we developed for the purification of the MRP1 protein from membranes of BHK cells was employed (19Chang X.B. Hou Y.X. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30962-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). CFTR with 10 C-terminal histidine residues was stably expressed in BHK cells as described (19Chang X.B. Hou Y.X. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30962-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Membranes were isolated following homogenization of these cells in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 1 mmEDTA and a protease inhibitor mixture (Ref. 19Chang X.B. Hou Y.X. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30962-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar)) by sedimentation of the post-nuclear supernatant at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Stripping of peripheral membrane proteins was achieved by incubation of resuspended membranes at pH 10.8 for 20 min at 4 °C. The alkali-stripped membranes were resuspended in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 500 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 20% glycerol containing 0.2% lipids (Escherichia coli crude lipids/phosphatidylcholine, 3:1) and 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) and incubated with agitation for 40 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the soluble supernatant was made 5 mm in imidazole and incubated overnight at 4 °C with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. The mixture was poured into a column and washed with 10 volumes of the same buffer solution first containing 40 mm imidazole and 0.5% DDM and then an additional 10 volumes with 60 mm imidazole and 0.1% DDM. For elution imidazole was increased to 400 mm and DDM kept at 0.1%. The eluate was diluted 2-fold and mixed with wheat germ lectin-Sepharose 6 MB for incubation overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After washing extensively with the buffer containing 0.1% DDM, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 500 mm NaCl, and a lipid mixture (phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine/cholesterol, 5:3:1:1) to achieve a final protein:lipid ratio of ∼1:100, elution was with the same solution also containing 50% ethylene glycol and 0.5mN-acetylglucosamine. The eluate was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, concentrated ∼10-fold, and made 10% in glycerol. ATPase activity was assayed employing [α-32P]ATP as substrate, separation of nucleotides by thin layer chromatography, and quantitation by electronic autoradiography. Previous experiments had shown that, when incubated with [α-32P]8-N3ATP under hydrolysis conditions, i.e. at 37 °C in the presence of Mg2+ ions, CFTR was photolabeled more strongly at NBD1 than at NBD2 (15Szabo K. Szakacs G. Hegeds T. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12209-12212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Aleksandrov L. Mengos A. Chang X. Aleksandrov A. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12918-12923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, because this labeling was only slightly enhanced by orthovanadate, known to trap the N3ADP product of hydrolysis at the active site of other ATPases (20Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was unclear whether labeling was with N3ATP or N3ADP or both. To resolve this issue and further characterize nucleotide interactions of the two NBDs of CFTR, we have tested conditions that influence hydrolysis and trapping. Fig.1A shows the results of labeling with [α-32P]8-N3ATP after incubation at different temperatures and in the presence or absence of Mg2+ ions and orthovanadate, i.e. conditions expected to influence hydrolysis and N3ADP trapping, respectively. From lanes 1 and 2 with incubation at 0 °C where hydrolysis should be minimal, Mg2+ is seen to slightly stimulate but not be essential for labeling of NBD1, whereas labeling of NBD2 is more dependent on the divalent cation. With incubation at 37 °C (lanes 3–5) where hydrolysis is enabled, there is much stronger labeling of NBD1 than at 0 °C. This labeling is increased by Mg2+ but less so by orthovanadate. Strikingly, labeling of NBD2 is almost completely dependent on Mg2+ ions and is also increased by vanadate. Additional clarification of whether labeling was with N3ATP or N3ADP was obtained by using [γ-32P]8-N3ATP (Fig. 1B). In that case after γ-phosphate is removed by hydrolysis, labeling by N3ADP would not be visible. At 0 °C (lanes 1and 2), there was labeling at NBD1 that was not strongly influenced by Mg2+ ions. Hence, consistent with the result with [α-32P]N3ATP at 0 °C, the first domain was clearly labeled by the intact unhydrolyzed nucleoside triphosphate. There was also weak labeling of NBD2 by the γ-32P-labeled nucleotide at 0 °C. It also labeled NBD1 more strongly at 37 °C than at 0 °C, again indicating strong labeling of that domain with the unhydrolyzed nucleoside triphosphate. However, the incremental amount of labeling of NBD1 with the α-32P-reagent on shifting from 0 °C to 37 °C (Fig.1A, lanes 1 and 2 compared withlanes 3 and 4) is even greater than with the γ-32P-reagent (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2 compared with lanes 3 and4). This is not surprising because hydrolysis, which is reflected as well as binding in the former case, is expected to have a large temperature coefficient typical of enzymatic reactions. These observations are consistent with hydrolysis occurring at both domains but more completely at NBD2 than NBD1 during the 10-min preincubation prior to photoactivation because labeling of NBD2 is detected only using the nucleotide with 32P in the α-phosphate position and not in the γ-phosphate position. The most striking revelation from the use of [γ-32P]N3ATP at 37 °C is the complete lack of labeling of NBD2 (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–5). This can only mean that the compound is hydrolyzed as soon as it is bound to that domain; labeling detected with the α-32P-labeled compound (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5) is by the hydrolysis product [α-32P]8-N3ADP. These results suggest that NBD2 is a site of more rapid hydrolysis than NBD1. One notable aspect of the above experiments was the observation that N3ATP binding to NBD1 was not dependent on Mg2+ ions. A similar finding was made earlier with another ABCC protein, SUR1 (21Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It is of particular interest for CFTR because the chloride channel can be activated by ATP in the absence of Mg2+, providing one piece of evidence that hydrolysis is not essential for activation (22Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X. Aleksandrov L. Riordan J.R. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Ikuma M. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8675-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Schultz B.D. Bridges R.J. Frizzell R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ion is required for photolabeling of NBD2 and an increment in labeling of NBD1 at 37 °C (Fig. 1) and for ATP hydrolysis by the whole CFTR protein (25Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28463-28468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This is confirmed in Fig. 2A, which shows that a maximal rate of hydrolysis occurred with approximately equimolar concentrations of ATP and Mg2+ (∼2 mm in this assay). It is also seen that Mn2+ is more potent than Mg2+ on a molar basis. Because there appears to be more rapid and complete hydrolysis at NBD2 than at NBD1, it might be anticipated that this greater effect of Mn2+ on hydrolysis by the whole protein might reflect its action on NBD2. Fig.2C indicates that this is the case, i.e.Mn2+ promotes much stronger labeling of NBD2 than Mg2+ with [α-32P]N3ATP as substrate. Because labeling of NBD2 using this substrate is entirely a result of bound [α-32P]N3ADP, this indicates that greater hydrolysis has occurred at NBD2 with Mn2+. Thus, there is a parallel between the divalent cation requirements for hydrolysis by the whole protein and that which occurs at NBD2. No divalent cation-independent nucleotide binding was detected at NBD2. That which occurs at NBD1 may account for the non-hydrolytic channel activation that occurs (22Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X. Aleksandrov L. Riordan J.R. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Ikuma M. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8675-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Schultz B.D. Bridges R.J. Frizzell R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the photolabeling experiments in Fig. 1, the unbound photoactive nucleotides were not removed after incubation with CFTR-containing membranes prior to UV irradiation. We had shown previously that labeling of NBD2 with [α-32P]N3ATP was greatly reduced if the reagent was washed out before photoactivation (16Aleksandrov L. Mengos A. Chang X. Aleksandrov A. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12918-12923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although we had thought this might reflect just a low affinity of the domain for the NTP, the finding that only the NDP was detected at NBD2 (Fig. 1) suggested that the hydrolysis product might not be retained at NBD2 as it is at NBD1. To examine this possibility, photolabeling was performed using [α-32P]8-N3ADP as well as [α-32P]8-N3ATP with and without washout of the compounds before irradiation. The results were remarkably similar with both compounds (Fig. 3),i.e. NBD1 was strongly labeled even after washout, but NBD2 was not. Hence, 8-azido-ADP is bound stably at NBD1 whether presented directly or as the product of hydrolysis of 8-azido-ATP, and this is not a result of trapping by orthovanadate as a mimic of a post-hydrolysis transition state complex. In contrast, the photoactive NDP labels NBD2 only when present in solution at the time of photoactivation; if it is removed after the 10-min period of incubation before irradiation, little or no labeling of NBD2 is detected. When combined with the results of Fig. 1, this provides strong evidence that MgN3ATP is bound and efficiently hydrolyzed by NBD2. The hydrolysis product, 8-azido-ADP, then dissociates more rapidly from NBD2 than NBD1 because none is detected at the former but is at the latter. Experiments employing both α- and γ-[32P]8-N3ATP and temperatures promoting (37 °C) or precluding (0 °C) hydrolysis have enabled an evaluation of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis at each of the NBDs. Once it is appreciated what occurs at each domain under different conditions, it is possible to estimate the proportions of N3ATP and N3ADP associated with each. As already shown in Fig. 1, when the two domains are resolved after limited trypsin digestion, there is no labeling of NBD2 with [γ-32P]8-N3ATP (Fig.4A, lanes 3 and4). Therefore, all the labeling of NBD2 not washed out prior to photoactivation (lane 1) is by the hydrolysis product [α-32P]8-N3ADP, which has dissociated, as indicated by lane 2 when reagents were washed out before irradiation. This comparison is also extremely informative for NBD1 whereby simply comparing the relative amounts of radioactivity associated with it in lanes 2 (4603 cpm in [α-32P]N3ATP and -N3ADP combined) and 4 (2049 cpm in [α-32P]N3ATP only), it can be seen that approximately equal amounts of the NTP and NDP are bound to NBD1 after 10 min of hydrolysis at 37 °C. A similar conclusion can be reached without even using limited trypsin digestion to separate fragments containing NBD1 and NBD2 if labeling is done at both 0 and 37 °C. For example, in Fig. 4B, labeling of NBD1 with radioactive N3ATP and N3ADP from [α-32P]N3ATP at 37 °C with washout before irradiation is indicated in lane 4 and the amount of NBD1 labeling by just N3ATP from [γ-32P]N3ATP of the same specific radioactivity is indicated in lane 6. Comparison of these two lanes yields the same conclusion as that obtained from the experiment in Fig. 3A, i.e. that approximately equal amounts of N3ATP and N3ADP are associated with NBD1. This interpretation is validated by the fact that binding of [γ-32P]N3ATP is similar at 0 and 37 °C (lanes 5 and 6 compared with lanes 7and 8). These experiments support the designation of NBD1 as a slow ATP turnover site and NBD2 as a rapid turnover site. We have interpreted the results of these experiments assuming that photolabeling of one NBD reflected events only at that domain. However, structural determination of NBDs of some ABC proteins has suggested that residues from both domains may participate in the binding and hydrolysis of each ATP (26Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 27Diederichs K. Diez J. Greller G. Muller C.

Lett. 1999; 179: 187-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the extent to which this may occur with CFTR, we determined the influence of mutation of the Walker A lysine residues in the P-loop of each domain, which contacts the β-phosphate of the bound nucleotide (Fig.5). As expected, the mutations K464A and K1250A prevented photolabeling with either 8-azido-ATP or 8-azido-ADP of NBD1 and NBD2, respectively. However, there was no indication that the mutation in one domain had any influence on the labeling of the other, i.e. in K464A, NBD2 was labeled as in wild-type and in K1250A, NBD1 was not different from wild type. Because labeling with [α-32P]N3ATP under these conditions (Fig.5A) reflects both binding of the nucleoside triphosphate and its diphosphate hydrolysis product at NBD1 and solely the latter at NBD2, it can be concluded that neither binding nor hydrolysis at one domain is entirely dependent on those events of the other domain. Binding of the NDP at each domain detected with [α-32P]N3ATP as substrate clearly is not dependent on an intact Walker A motif in the other domain. Although these observations do not exclude cooperativity between the two domains at some level, they do indicate that the NDP, which dissociates so readily from NBD2 after NTP hydrolysis there, does not contribute significantly to the labeling of NBD1. The occlusion of the NDP at NBD1 and lack thereof at NBD2 obviously precludes any movement of the nucleotide in the opposite direction. As another means of evaluating the influence of nucleotide interaction at one domain on that of the other, the apparently selective interaction of AMP-PNP with NBD1 was employed. The concentration dependence of photolabeling with [α-32P]N3AMP-PNP is shown in Fig.6A and reveals a much higher affinity for NBD1 than for NBD2. Little interaction with NBD2 is detected at concentrations below 100 μm. Concentrations in this range were found to almost completely inhibit labeling of NBD1 with [α-32P]N3ATP (16Aleksandrov L. Mengos A. Chang X. Aleksandrov A. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12918-12923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This effect is illustrated again in Fig. 6B, where 150 μmN3-AMP-PNP ablates the N3ATP labeling of the NBD1 band. This occurs, however, without any diminution of labeling of the NBD2 band. Hence, as with a mutation (K464A) that prevents labeling of NBD1 by N3ATP, occupation of the domain by AMP-PNP leaves the labeling of NBD2 with [α-32P]N3ATP entirely intact. The above experiments have shown distinct differences between the NBDs of CFTR in their interactions with nucleotides including divalent cation dependence, extent of hydrolysis, and dissociation. To focus strictly on the binding events, we utilized [α-32P]N3ADP and [γ-32P]N3ATP at 0 °C over a wide range of concentrations. Fig. 7Areveals that the NDP exhibits apparently conventional saturable binding to both domains with no marked difference in affinity for the two domains under these conditions where the nucleotide is kept present in solution until the time of photoactivation. Both sets of data are fit well by a single hyperbolic function. If the azido-nucleotide is removed from solution prior to irradiation, however, there is dissociation from NBD2 as would be expected from an equilibrium binding reaction. In contrast, NBD1 exhibits non-equilibrium behavior by occluding the NDP; hence, essentially the same curve is obtained when the nucleotide is washed out before photoactivation (data not shown). Nevertheless, the inherent binding affinities of the two domains for N3ADP do not appear to be significantly different. The binding curves for [γ-32P]N3ATP at 0 °C, however, appear quite different (Fig. 7B). Simple saturable binding occurs at NBD1, but the NBD2 curve is shifted to the right at low concentrations and i"

In particular, specific labeling and quantitation of mitochondrial protein cysteine residues have not been achieved due to the lack of reagents available that can be applied to the intact organelle or cell. To overcome these problems we have used a combination of mitochondrial proteomics and targeted labeling of mitochondrial thiols using a novel compound, (4-iodobutyl)triphenylphosphonium (IBTP). This lipophilic cation is accumulated by mitochondria and yields stable thioether adducts in a thiol-specific reaction. The selective uptake into mitochondria, due to the large membrane potential across the inner membrane, and the high pH of the matrix results in specific labeling of mitochondrial protein thiols by IBTP. Individual mitochondrial proteins that changed thiol redox state following oxidative stress could then be identified by their decreased reaction with IBTP and isolated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. We demonstrate the selectivity of IBTP labeling and use it to show that glutathione oxidation and exposure to anS-nitrosothiol or to peroxynitrite cause extensive redox changes to mitochondrial thiol proteins. In conjunction with blue native gel electrophoresis, we used IBTP labeling to demonstrate that thiols are exposed on the matrix faces of respiratory Complexes I, II, and IV. This novel approach enables measurement of the thiol redox state of individual mitochondrial proteins during oxidative stress and cell death.

However the detailed mechanisms and the proteins involved are uncertain. This is partly because of the technical challenges presented by determining thiol modifications of proteins in general and the difficulties inherent in mitochondrial proteomics. Potential protein thiol alterations include formation of mixed disulfides or internal disulfides from vicinal dithiols,S-nitrosation, and the formation of higher oxidation states (10.Beltran B.

The differential reactivity of individual protein thiols and the range of lifetimes of altered redox states can act as signal sensors or transducers to influence mitochondrial function (13.Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 14.Gitler C. Zarmi B. Kalef E. Anal.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24929-24932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nitric oxide may be a particularly important regulator of mitochondrial protein thiols because it diffuses easily into mitochondria and partitions selectively into the lipid bilayer where it can modify otherwise inaccessible thiols (18.Shiva S. Brookes P.S. Patel R.P. Anderson P.G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7212-7217Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 19.Ghafourifar P. Richter C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11044-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Modification of protein thiols by nitric oxide most likely occurs through its nitrosating derivatives peroxynitrite or ⋅NO2, and nitrosated protein thiols can go on to form mixed or internal disulfides (12.Stamler J.S. Hausladen A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Finally, many reactive oxygen species oxidize thiols directly to thiyl radicals that can then form disulfides and higher thiol oxidation states (21.Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In all cases the extent of the redox changes to mitochondrial thiol proteins, and the proteins affected have not been determined at the molecular level. To identify those mitochondrial thiol proteins that change redox state during oxidative damage or cell death, we first set out to label unmodified mitochondrial protein thiols selectively within cells. Changes in protein thiol redox state would then manifest themselves by decreased labeling. To achieve this, advantage was taken of the large membrane potential across the inner membrane that causes lipophilic cations to accumulate within mitochondria (22.Liberman E.A. Topali V.P. Tsofina L.M. Jasaitis A.A. Skulachev V.P. Nature. 1969; 222: 1076-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 23.Murphy M.P. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 326-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and the lipophilic cation (4-iodobutyl)triphenylphosphonium (IBTP) 1The abbreviations used are: IBTP(4-iodobutyl)triphenylphosphoniumBN-PAGEblue native PAGEBrBTP(4- bromobutyl)triphenylphosphoniumClBTP(4-chlorobutyl)triphenylphosphoniumDTNBdithionitrobenzoic acidFCCPcarbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneIEFisoelectric focusingNEMN-ethylmaleimideSNAPS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillaminetBHPtert-butyl hydroperoxideTPMPmethyltriphenylphosphoniumTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinePBSphosphate-buffered salineTBSTris-buffered salineDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumKLHkeyhole limpet hemocyaninFCSfetal calf serumBSAbovine serum albumin was synthesized. It is predicted that IBTP will accumulate 5–10-fold in the cytoplasm driven by the plasma membrane potential and should then be further concentrated several hundred-fold within mitochondria (Fig. 1) (23.Murphy M.P. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 326-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Inside mitochondria protein thiolates should displace the iodo functional group of IBTP to form stable phosphonium thioethers that can be identified by immunoblotting using antitriphenylphosphonium antiserum (Fig. 1). The pK a values of protein thiols are typically 8–8.5; consequently thiols in mitochondria (pH ∼8) are more reactive than in the cytosol (pH ∼7.2), potentially further increasing the mitochondrial selectivity of IBTP labeling. These factors would enhance the selectivity of the modification of mitochondrial thiol proteins by IBTP, which may then be identified by two-dimensional immunoblotting. Modifications leading to changes in protein function that could be identified by this approach are formation of mixed disulfides,S-nitrosation, or oxidation. The approach taken here is to validate this approach in both cellular and organellar systems before the application to more complex physiological settings.

A number of mitochondrial thiol proteins have been mapped as single spots by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, highlighting the potential of this approach to assess changes in mitochondrial thiols in response to oxidative stress. IBTP was synthesized by reacting 1,4-diiodobutane (2.46 g; 7.9 mmol) with triphenylphosphine (0.423 g; 1.61 mmol) at 100 °C under argon in the dark for 1.5 h. The yellow solid was washed with diethyl ether (3 × 8 ml) and then dissolved in dichloromethane (5 ml) and precipitated with diethyl ether (3 × 50 ml); the solvents were decanted after each precipitation. Residual solvent was then removed under reduced pressure to give a pale yellow solid (0.518 g; 0.91 mmol; 57%) that was stored at −20 °C and protected from light. IBTP was readily soluble in ethanol giving an absorption spectrum with local maxima at 263, 268, and 275 nm and an extinction coefficient at 268 nm of 3000m−1·cm−1, typical for alkyltriphenylphosphonium salts (24.Burns R.J. Smith R.A.J. Murphy M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).

(4-Chlorobutyl)triphenylphosphonium (ClBTP) was synthesized by reacting 1-chloro-4-iodobutane (0.306 g, 1.4 mmol) with triphenylphosphine (0.133 g, 0.51 mmol) and stirring at 100 °C for 1.5 h under an argon atmosphere in the dark. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the glassy product washed with diethyl ether (3 × 5 ml). The residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (1 ml) and precipitated with diethyl ether (10 ml), and the solvents were removed by decantation. This precipitation process was repeated three more times, and the final solid material was dried under high vacuum at room temperature to give the product (0.159 g, 0.33 mmol, 65%),1H NMR (CDCl3) 7.6–7.9 (15H, m,Ph 3CH2CH2CH2CH2Cl), 3.8–3.9 (2H, m, Ph3CH 2CH2CH2CH2Cl), 3.70 (2H, triplet, J = 6Hz, Ph3CH2CH2CH2CH 2Cl), 2.24 (2H, quintet, J = 6Hz, Ph3CH2CH2CH 2CH2Cl), 1.85 (2H, m, Ph3CH2CH 2CH2CH2Cl) ppm, 31P NMR (CDCl3) 25.33 ppm. ClBTP was readily soluble in ethanol giving an absorption spectrum with local maxima at 263, 268, and 275 nm and an extinction coefficient at 268 nm of 3,000 m−1 cm−1, typical for alkyltriphenylphosphonium salts (24.Burns R.J. Smith R.A.J. Murphy M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). (4-Bromobutyl)triphenylphosphonium (BrBTP) was from Aldrich. BSA (1.52 mm) in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) was reduced with 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol followed by dialysis against the same buffer (25.Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contained ∼0.64 thiol/molecule as assessed by reaction with dithionitrobenzoic acid (DTNB; ε412 = 13,600 m−1 cm−1 (26.Ellman G. Lysko H. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)). To prepare IBTP-BSA for immunoblotting, reduced BSA (10 μm) was reacted with IBTP (50 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C, dissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and stored at −20 °C. Glutathione (0.5–2 mm) or reduced BSA (500 μm) was reacted with 2.5 mm IBTP at 37 °C in 80 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 or 7.2. Samples were removed after various times, and free thiols were determined by reaction with DTNB as above (26.Ellman G. Lysko H. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The thiolamine cross-linker m-maleimidobenzoic acidN-hydroxysuccinimide ester (0.75 mg) in 50 μl of Me2SO was reacted with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (5 μg; KLH) in 0.5 ml of PBS, pH 6, at room temperature for 30 min.m-Maleimidobenzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-KLH was purified on Sephadex G-25 and reacted with thiobutyltriphenylphosphonium (20 mg) (24.Burns R.J. Smith R.A.J. Murphy M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) overnight at room temperature, and aliquots were stored at −20 °C. After taking samples of pre-immune serum, aliquots of TBTP-KLH were mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) by repeated passage through an 18-gauge syringe needle and injected into pairs of rabbits at multiple sites subcutaneously. This was followed by two booster injections of TBTP-KLH mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma) and collection of the rabbit antiserum against triphenylphosphonium. For some experiments an IgG-enriched fraction was prepared using a protein A-agarose column (Affi-Gel; Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE gels (12.5% acrylamide) were run by standard procedures using a Bio-Rad Mini Protean system, transferred to 0.1 μm nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad Mini Trans Blot system and blocked with 5% milk powder in TBS. Antibody binding was detected using 1:500–1:5,000 dilutions of antitriphenylphosphonium antiserum and 1:3,000–1:10,000 dilutions of secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) against rabbit or mouse IgG conjugated to either alkaline phosphatase and visualized by chromogenic substrate or to horseradish peroxidase and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. For two-dimensional electrophoresis, mitochondria or membrane/matrix fractions were loaded onto an Immobiline Drystrip IPG gel (Amersham Biosciences, pH range 3–10 or 4–7), and proteins were separated using the Amersham Biosciences IPGphor Isoelectric Focusing System following the manufacturer's recommendations. The strips were then incubated in 6 m urea, 2% SDS, 561 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8, 20% glycerol, 130 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min followed by incubation in 6 m urea, 2% SDS, 561 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 20% glycerol, 135 mmiodoacetamide for 15 min, and the proteins were separated in the second dimension by SDS-PAGE. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or blotted onto 0.1 μm nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad Semidry Blotting System and probed with antitriphenylphosphonium antiserum as above. Blue native gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) was carried out on a 5–12% linear acrylamide gradient using either a mini gel or full sized gel format (27.Schagger H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Ferritin dimer (880 kDa) and catalase monomer and dimer (230/460 kDa) were used as molecular weight markers. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad Semidry Blotting System and probed with antitriphenylphosphonium antiserum as above or monoclonal antibodies against respiratory chain components. The following monoclonal antibodies were from Molecular Probes: Complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) 39-kDa subunit, A-11140; Complex II (succinate-ubiquinol oxidoreductase) 70-kDa subunit, A-11142; and Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) subunit I, 57 kDa, A-6403. Separation in the second dimension after BN-PAGE was performed by excising a lane from a native gel, placing it on a Bio-Rad mini-gel electrophoresis glass plate, and denaturing the proteins by soaking in 1% SDS, 1% β−mercaptoethanol for 30 min. The electrophoresis cassette was then assembled and a three-layer (10, 8, and 5%) Tris-Tricine gel poured below the excised gel lane. Duplicate gels were run and either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted using antitriphenylphosphonium antiserum as described above. Rat liver mitochondria were prepared by homogenization followed by differential centrifugation in STE medium (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) (28.Chappell J.B. Hansford R.G. Birnie G.D. Subcellular Components: Preparation and Fractionation. Butterworths, London1972: 77-91Google Scholar), and the protein concentration was determined by the biuret assay using BSA as a standard (29.Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were subfractionated into membrane and matrix-enriched fractions by pelleting followed by incubation on ice for 30 min with the detergent Lubrol (0.2 mg/mg protein) at 10 mg of protein/ml in KCl buffer followed by centrifugation (Airfuge at 24 pounds/square inch ≃100,000 × g for 10 min). The matrix-enriched supernatant fraction was retained and for some procedures concentrated by acetone precipitation (9 volumes of acetone at −20 °C for 30 min). The membrane fraction was washed in KCl buffer, and the protein concentration of both fractions was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay using BSA as a standard (30.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). To measure thiol content, mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in KCl buffer (110 mm KCl, 10 mmHepes, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2) containing 10 mmsuccinate and rotenone with various concentrations of IBTP at 30 °C for 15 min. To measure glutathione equivalents the mitochondria were pelleted, resuspended in 100 μl of 5-sulfosalicylic acid (5%), and glutathione equivalents quantitated by the recycling assay using glutathione as a standard (31.Anderson M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). Total mitochondrial protein thiols were determined by precipitating protein with 10% trichloroacetic acid, resuspending the pellet in 2% SDS in 80 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, and quantitating free thiols by reaction with DTNB (32.Di Monte D. Ross D. Bellomo G. Eklow L. Orrenius S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). To measure free thiols exposed in non-denatured mitochondria, the mitochondria were pelleted, resuspended in 80 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, and disrupted by freezing in dry ice/ethanol followed by thawing in a 30 °C water bath (3 times), and the thiol content was measured by reaction with DTNB. To measure membrane-associated free thiols in native mitochondria, a membrane fraction was isolated from the freeze-thawed mitochondria by centrifugation (13,000 ×g for 10 min) followed by washing in KCl buffer. To measure the effects of IBTP on respiration, mitochondria (2 mg of protein/ml) were incubated at 25 °C in a 3-ml oxygen electrode in 110 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, with either 10 mm succinate and rotenone or 5 mm each of glutamate and malate in the presence of various concentrations of IBTP. Coupled respiration was measured first, then phosphorylating respiration after addition of ADP (200 μm), and finally uncoupled respiration after addition of carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP; 200 nm). The membrane potential was measured by incubating mitochondria with 1 μm methyltriphenylphosphonium (TPMP) supplemented with [3H]TPMP (50 nCi·ml−1). After incubation the mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation. The amount of TPMP in the pellet and supernatant was quantitated by scintillation counting, and the membrane potential was calculated, assuming a mitochondrial volume of 0.5 μl·mg protein−1and that 60% of intramitochondrial TPMP was membrane-bound (33.Brown G.C. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Membrane potential data were the mean of triplicate determinations and were repeated on 2–3 independent mitochondrial preparations. Mitoplasts were prepared from mitochondria by treatment with digitonin (0.125 mg of digitonin/mg of mitochondrial protein) on ice for 15 min followed by washing in STE supplemented with 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA (34.Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmer V.M. Lowe P.N. Darley-Usmer V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 79-112Google Scholar). A fraction enriched for the outer membrane was prepared from the initial supernatant of the mitoplast preparation by centrifugation (144,000 × g for 20 min) followed by washing, and the supernatant from the first centrifugation was retained as the intermembrane space fraction (34.Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmer V.M. Lowe P.N. Darley-Usmer V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 79-112Google Scholar). Human fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Protein was quantitated by the bicinchoninic acid assay using BSA as a standard (30.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry human fibroblasts were plated onto 13-mm diameter glass coverslips overnight (35.Muratovska A. Lightowlers R.N. Taylor R.W. Turnbull D.M. Smith R.A.J. Wilce J.A. Martin S.W. Murphy M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1852-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Following incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 μm IBTP ± 10 μm FCCP, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS for 30 min, washed with TBS, and incubated with 10% FCS, 0.1% Triton X-100/TBS (TBST) for 10 min. The IgG fraction of antitriphenylphosphonium antiserum (1:500) and anti-cytochrome oxidase (1:100, subunit Iα, mouse monoclonal, Molecular Probes) diluted in TBST were then added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The IgG fraction of preimmune serum was used as a control. After washing with TBS (3 times for 5 min), the cells were incubated with appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in TBS (anti-rabbit IgG Oregon Green (1:100) or anti-mouse IgG Texas Red (1:400); Molecular Probes) for 15 min in the dark. Cells were then washed in TBS and mounted in diazabicyclooctane/polyvinyl alcohol medium on coverslips. Images were acquired using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning confocal microscope using a Nikon Diaphot TMD inverted microscope and a 60×/NA 1.4 oil immersion Plan-Apochromat objective. For immunogold electron microscopy, human fibroblasts in 24-well tissue culture plates were incubated with 200 μl of DMEM/FCS with 1 μm IBTP ± 10 μm FCCP for 4 h at 37 °C, then harvested with trypsin, pelleted, and washed in PBS. The pellet was warmed to 37 °C, and 200 μl of fixative (4% formaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 m cacodylate, pH 7.2, 6 mm CaCl2) was added and replaced with fresh fixative after 30 s. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the cell pellet was washed with 200 μl of 0.15 mcacodylate, pH 7.2, 3 mm CaCl2 (3 × 10 min at room temperature), warmed to 45 °C, mixed with 2% agar in 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 7.2, and pelleted. After rinsing in PBS (3 times for 10 min), the pellets were dehydrated in ethanol, embedded in Lowicryl white (SPI Supplies) and polymerized under UV light at 0 °C. Ultrathin sections were mounted on nickel grids that were floated on drops of 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 10 min, then 1% BSA in PBS for 15 min, followed by antitriphenylphosphonium antiserum overnight at 4 °C (1:10 in 1% BSA, 1% Tween 20 in PBS). After washing in PBS (3 times for 5 min) and 1% BSA/PBS, sections were incubated with colloidal gold particles (10 nm) linked to either goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5 in 1% Tween 20/PBS, Sigma) or extravidin (1:10 in 1% Tween 20/PBS, Sigma) for 1 h, followed by washing and fixation (2% glutaraldehyde for 15 min). The sections were then stained with osmium tetroxide/uranyl acetate/lead citrate and examined in a CM100 transmission electron microscope. Fibroblasts were harvested by trypsin treatment, incubated at 5 × 106 cells·ml−1 in DMEM without FCS at 37 °C for 10 min, and then IBTP (5 μm) was added, and 10 min later the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3,000 ×g for 5 min) and washed in PBS. For whole cell samples the pellet was suspended directly in 100 μl of loading buffer. For subfractionation cells were resuspended in 500 μl of STE, homogenized using a 5-ml Dounce homogenizer, and nuclei and unbroken cells were then pelleted (3,000 × g for 5 min). This pellet was washed in 500 μl of STE, and the combined supernatants were centrifuged (13,000 × g for 2 min) to give a mitochondria-enriched pellet and a cytosol-enriched supernatant. The mitochondrial pellet was washed in STE, and the supernatant was acetone-precipitated. Assays of the mitochondrial enzyme citrate synthase and of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase confirmed that this fractionation procedure was effective, with less than 5% lactate dehydrogenase activity in the mitochondrial fraction that contained about 40% of the total citrate synthase activity (36.Appleby R.D. Porteous W.K. Hughes G. James A.M. Shannon D. Wei Y.-H. Murphy M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Cells (5 × 106/ml) were incubated in RPMI, 1% FCS at 37 °C in medium supplemented with 10 mm Hepes. After incubation cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3,000 ×g for 5 min) and washed in PBS, and the pellet was suspended directly in loading buffer. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were harvested from descending thoracic aortas and maintained in DMEM containing 1 g·l−1 glucose and 10% FCS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Cells used in this study were between passages 5 and 10. For IBTP treatment 5 × 105 cells were seeded in each well of 6-well plates in the growth medium and used when confluent. After incubation with IBTP the medium was removed, and the cells were suspended in loading buffer using a cell scraper.

https://openalex.org/W2103355607,"Abstract The Rh blood group proteins are well known as the erythrocyte targets of the potent antibody response that causes hemolytic disease of the newborn. These proteins have been described in molecular detail; however, little is known about their function. A transport function is suggested by their predicted structure and from phylogenetic analysis. To obtain evidence for a role in solute transport, we expressed Rh proteins in Xenopusoocytes and now demonstrate that the erythroid Rh-associated glycoprotein mediates uptake of ammonium across cell membranes. Rh-associated glycoprotein carrier-mediated uptake, characterized with the radioactive analog of ammonium [14C]methylamine (MA), had an apparent EC50 of 1.6 mm and a maximum uptake rate (V max) of 190 pmol/oocyte/min. Uptake was independent of the membrane potential and the Na+ gradient. MA transport was stimulated by raising extracellular pH or by lowering intracellular pH, suggesting that uptake was coupled to an outwardly directed H+ gradient. MA uptake was insensitive to additions of amiloride, amine-containing compounds tetramethyl- and tetraethylammonium chloride, glutamine, and urea. However, MA uptake was significantly antagonized by ammonium chloride with inhibition kinetics (IC50 = 1.14 mm) consistent with the hypothesis that the uptake of MA and ammonium involves a similar H+-coupled counter-transport mechanism."

Oxygen isotope profiles in otoliths excavated from Ostra [6010 ± 90 years before the present (yr B.P.); 8°55′S] indicate that summer SSTs were ∼3°C warmer than those of the present. Siches otoliths (6450 ± 110 yr B.P.; 4°40′S) recorded mean annual temperatures ∼3° to 4°C warmer than were measured under modern conditions. Trophic level and population diversity and equitability data from these faunal assemblages and other Peruvian archaeological sites support the isotope interpretations and suggest that upwelling of the Peru-Chile current intensified after ∼5000 yr B.P.

https://openalex.org/W2049712429,"Protein ubiquitination plays an important role in regulating the abundance and conformation of a broad range of eukaryotic proteins. This process involves a cascade of enzymes including ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3). E1 and E2 represent two families of structurally related proteins and are relatively well characterized. In contrast, the nature and mechanism of E3, proposed to contain activities in catalyzing isopeptide bond formation (ubiquitin ligation) and substrate targeting, remains inadequately understood. Two major families of E3 ubiquitin ligases, the HECT (forhomologous to E6-AP Cterminus) family and the RING family, have been identified that utilize distinct mechanisms in promoting isopeptide bond formation. Here, we showed that purified RING finger domain of ROC1, an essential subunit of SKP1-cullin/CDC53-F box protein ubiquitin ligases, was sufficient to activate UBCH5c to synthesize polyubiquitin chains. The sequence flanking the RING finger in ROC1 did not contribute to UBCH5c activation, but was required for binding with CUL1. We demonstrated that all cullins, through their binding with ROC proteins, constituted active ubiquitin ligases, suggesting the existence in vivo of a large number of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. These results are consistent with the notion that the RING finger domains allosterically activate E2. We suggest that RING-E2, rather than cullin-RING, constitutes the catalytic core of the ubiquitin ligase and that one major function of the cullin subunit is to assemble the RING-E2 catalytic core and substrates together.

Polyubiquitinated substrates are then rapidly delivered to and degraded by the 26 S proteasome (1King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.-M. Kirschner M.W.

Both E1 and E2 represent structurally related proteins and are relatively well characterized. Five E1s have been described for activating ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers (3Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar): monomeric E1s Uba1, Apg7, and Uba4 that activate ubiquitin, Apg12, and Urm1, respectively; and two heterodimeric E1-like complexes Uba3-Ula1 and Uba2-Aos1, which activate Rub1/Nedd8 and SUMO-1, respectively. E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes contain a conserved ∼150-amino acid catalytic core and are present in the eukaryotic genome as a multigene family (13 in budding yeast, 29 in fruit fly, and at least 33 in human genomes). The E3 ubiquitin ligases, on the other hand, have been defined more ambiguously and operatively as an activity involved in both catalyzing isopeptide bond formation (ubiquitin ligation) and recruiting substrate. Currently, two major families of E3 ligases have been described. The homologous to E6-AP Cterminus (HECT) family of E3s was discovered in the studies of ubiquitin-mediated degradation of tumor suppressor p53 in cells expressing papilloma viral oncoprotein E6 (4Huibregtse J.M. Schneffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). E6associates with a cellularprotein, E6AP, to promote p53 degradation (5Scheffner M. Takahashi T. Huibregtse J.M. Minna J.D. Howley P.M. J.

A domain of ∼350 residues located at the C terminus of E6AP contains an active cysteine residue that can form thioester linkages with ubiquitin and whose mutation abolished the ligase activity of E6AP (4Huibregtse J.M.

Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). A large number of cellular proteins with otherwise diverse structures contain a domain homologous to E6-AP Cterminus (2Hershko A.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). One biochemical mechanism underlying the physiological functions of these HECT domain-containing proteins is believed to be protein ubiquitination. The second family of E3s contains a RING finger domain or subunit essential for their ubiquitin ligase activity (8Jackson P. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D.R.

Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The RING finger motif was initially defined a decade ago as a novel cysteine-rich sequence present in several otherwise unrelated proteins (12Freemont P.S. Hanson I.M. Trowsdale J. Cell. 1991; 64: 483-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). There exist a large number of RING finger-containing proteins in all eukaryotes (more than 350 in human genome), implicating a broad involvement of RING-dependent ubiquitination. The RING finger comprises eight cysteine and histidine residues that bind two atoms of zinc to form one unique three-dimensional structure referred to as the cross-brace rather than two separate mini-domains (13Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Lally J. O'Reilly N.J. Martin S. Howe K. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1532-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Both the length and sequence between these eight conserved Cys and His residues vary significantly among different RING fingers. Based on the arrangement of Cys and His residues, RING fingers can be categorized into three subclasses: C3H2C3 (or RING-H2), C3HC4 (or RING-HC), and infrequently C2H2C4. Despite its presence in a wide range of proteins involved in various important cellular processes, the biochemical function of the RING finger was unknown until the relatively recent discovery of its role in protein ubiquitination. Of a half-dozen well characterized RING finger proteins, investigations of ROC1 and APC11 have contributed significantly to our realization of RING finger domain mediated ubiquitination. APC11 is a subunit of theanaphase-promoting complex (APC or cyclosome) that is required for both entry into anaphase as well as exit from mitosis (14Yu H. Peters J.-M. King R.W. Page A.M. Hieter P.

Science. 1998; 279: 1216-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). ROC1 (also known as Rbx1 and Hrt1) is an essential subunit of SKP1-cullin 1/CDC53-F box protein (SCF) complexes that function in regulating G1 cell cycle control and signal transduction (16Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Yan Q. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 17Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol.

Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Unlike most other RING finger-containing proteins, both ROC1 (108 residues) and APC11 (84 residues) are small proteins with the RING finger taking up most of the coding capacity. Various mutational analyses have demonstrated the requirement of each of the eight conserved Cys or His residues, and thus the integrity of RING finger, for the ubiquitin ligase activity. A third emerging family of E3s contains a so-called U box, a domain of ∼ 100 amino acid residues present in diverse proteins from all eukaryotic organisms. The prototype of U box proteins, yeast UFD2, was identified by its activity to collaborate with E1, E2, and a HECT domain protein UFD4 for an efficient synthesis of polyubiquitin chains (21Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). At least six U box proteins have been found to mediate polyubiquitination in the presence of E1 and E2, but absence of E3 (22Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Despite lacking signature Cys and His residues in the U box, a computer-assisted data base search and three-dimensional structural threading revealed a similarity between the RING finger domain and the U box from various proteins, including UFD2 (23Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R132-R134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that U boxes more likely represent a modified version of the RING finger that probably acts as a E3 via a mechanism similar to that of the RING finger family, rather than constitute a distinct fourth activity on the E1-E2-E3 ubiquitination pathway. The exact biochemical mechanism underlying the function of RING fingers in protein ubiquitination remains incompletely understood. In vivo, the function of ROC1 and APC11 are dependent on their interactions with CUL1 and cullin-related APC2, respectively. ROC1 function has been linked to stabilize or bridge the interaction of E2 with cullins (18Seol J.H. Feldman R.M.R. Zachariae W. Shevchenko A. Correll C.C. Lyapina S. Chi Y. Galova M. Claypool J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8185-8197Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and to facilitate covalent modification of cullins by a ubiquitin-like protein, NEDD8/Rub1 (16Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Yan Q. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 24Furukawa M. Zhang Y. McCarville J. Ohta T. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8185-8197Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, APC11 alone, in the absence of cullin-like APC2, can interact with E2-UBC4 and is sufficient to promote E1- and E2-dependent polyubiquitin chain formation on protein substrates (25Leverson J.D. Joazeriro C.A.P. Page A.M. Huang H.-k. Hieter P. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2315-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 26Gmachl M. Gieffers C. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M.

This finding raises the question on the role of RING fingers in E2 activation and substrate recognition. We report that ROC1 contains two domains, the C-terminally located RING finger that alone is sufficient to activate UBC5 and an N-terminal domain required for binding with CUL1. We demonstrate that cullins, through their binding with a ROC protein and the autonomous allosteric activation of E2 by the ROC RING finger, could assemble more than a dozen distinct ubiquitin ligases. Full-length mammalian cullins, ROC1, ROC2, APC11, APC2, SKP1, and SKP2 expression plasmids were described in Refs. 17Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol.

ROC1 mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. Different E2s were amplified from a HeLa cDNA library by PCR and inserted into a T7 bacterial expression vector fused in-frame with a hexahistidine tag. Sequences for each ROC1 mutant and amplified E2 were verified by direct DNA sequencing. Purified rabbit E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (Affiniti, United Kingdom) and ubiquitin (Sigma) were purchased commercially. Hexahistidine-tagged ubiquitin (containing protein kinase C phosphorylation site) and E2 proteins were expressed in bacteria using the pET-3E-6xHis vector with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, purified using nickel beads (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and stored with 10% glycerol at −80 °C. Hexahistidine-tagged mCDC34 was expressed using a baculovirus and purified from Sf9 insect cells. The concentrations of all the purified proteins were determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining prior to the ubiquitination assay. GST-tagged ROC1 and ROC2 were expressed in BL21 (DE3) bacteria using the pGEX vector with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and purified using glutathione-agarose (Sigma). 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Cell transfections were carried out using calcium-phosphate buffer. For each transfection 15 or 5 μg of total plasmid DNA were used per 100- or 60-mm dish, respectively. Procedures for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting have been described previously (28Jenkins C.W. Xiong Y. Pagano M. Cell Cycle: Material and Methods. Springer-Verlag, New York1995: 250-263Google Scholar) with modification of the lysis buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmDTT, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 150 μg/ml benzamidine).

ROC and cullin immunocomplexes were precipitated from untransfected 293T cells with affinity-purified anti-ROC1 (1.5 μg) or anti-APC11 (3 μg) antibody, or from transfected cells with 3 μg of affinity-purified anti-CUL1, anti-HA, or anti-Myc antibody. For substrate-free ubiquitination assays, individual immunocomplexes were immobilized on protein A-agarose beads, washed three times with Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer, and washed twice with a buffer containing 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol. Washed immunocomplexes were added to a ubiquitin ligation reaction (final volume 30 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid, 2 mmATP, 0.6 mm DTT, 0.75 μg of [32P]ubiquitin, 60 ng of E1, and 300 ng of E2. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, terminated by boiling for 5 min with SDS-sample buffer containing 0.1 m DTT, and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography to visualize ubiquitin ladders. Discovery of ROC1 and ROC2 proteins, their combinatorial interactions with different cullins, and the function of cullin-ROC complexes in ubiquitination of various substrates raises issues on the role of ROC and cullin protein in ubiquitin ligation. Although only one E1 gene exists for activating ubiquitin, there are multiple E2s involved in ubiquitin conjugation (e.g. 13 in yeast) and an unknown number of E3s. Specific substrates may be selectively ubiquitinated by different E3s, and different E3s may preferentially interact with different E2s. This generates a potentially enormous complexity when assaying for in vitro ubiquitination of a specific substrate. Therefore, before testing in vitro ubiquitination of specific substrates, we first determined the interactions between different E2s and ROC1- and APC11-associated ligases in the absence of a substrate. This was made possible by the finding that the ROC1-CUL1 and APC11-APC2 complexes can promote ubiquitin-ubiquitin ligation in the absence of exogenously added substrate (20Tan P. Fuches S.Y. Wu A. Angus K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.-Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 29Ohta T. Michel J. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6758-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Ubc3/CDC34 and UbcH5c were expressed and purified from insect cell or bacteria, respectively, to near homogeneity (Fig.1A), and incubated with either the ROC1 or the APC11 immunocomplex in the presence of purified E1 and32P-labeled ubiquitin. These two immunocomplexes represent a number of distinct ubiquitin ligases; the anti-ROC1 immunocomplex contains at least four different ROC1-cullin ligases (ROC1-CUL1, ROC1-CUL2, ROC1-CUL3, and ROC1-CUL4A), and the APC11 immunocomplex contains APC2 (29Ohta T. Michel J. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6758-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin ligation was determined by incorporation of 32P-labeled ubiquitin into a high molecular weight smear characteristic of an incremental ubiquitin ladder. Incubation of ROC1 immunocomplexes with CDC34 and UbcH5c resulted in the formation of a polyubiquitin chain (Fig. 1B). Distinctly, the APC11 immunocomplex promoted polyubiquitination when incubated with UbcH5c but exhibited very little polyubiquitination activity over the background when incubated with CDC34. This is consistent with the observation that CDC34 functions during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, whereas the APC is most active during mitosis, an activity that is not affected by CDC34 mutation. UbcH5c shares 97% identity with Ubc4, an E2 that mediates APC-dependent cyclin B1 ubiquitination (30Yu H. King R.W. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that, as determined by the substrate-independent in vitroubiquitination assay, ROC1-associated ligases can utilize CDC34 and UbcH5c, and the APC11-APC2 ligase can use UbcH5c. Prompted by the finding that purified recombinant APC11 alone is sufficient to activate Hbc4 (25Leverson J.D. Joazeriro C.A.P. Page A.M. Huang H.-k. Hieter P. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2315-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 26Gmachl M. Gieffers C. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Peters J.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8973-8978Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), we tested whether purified recombinant ROC1 and ROC2 can activate UbcH5 and CDC34 in vitro in the absence of their cullin partners. GST-ROC1 fusion protein was expressed in bacteria and purified to near homogeneity (Fig.2A) and incubated with purified UbcH5c in the presence of E1 and 32P-labeled ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 2B, recombinant GST-ROC1, but not control GST protein (lane 3), was capable of activating UbcH5c to synthesize polyubiquitin chains in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 4–6) to an efficiency similar to that observed with ROC1-CUL1 complexes derived from transfected 293T cells (lane 2). Omitting E1 (lane 7) abolished polyubiquitin chain formation, indicating that ROC1-mediated UbcH5c activation is E1-dependent. We next determined the sequence within ROC1 that is necessary for activating UbcH5c. The human ROC1 protein contains 108 amino acid residues. The H2-RING finger occupies the C-terminal half of the protein and many mutations within the RING finger abolish its ligase activity. The function of the N-terminal half of ROC1 has not been determined. We generated two deletion mutants, ROC1ΔN23 and ROC1ΔN41, which removed the N-terminal 23 and 41 residues from ROC1, respectively (Fig.3A), and determined their effect on binding with CUL1 in vivo and activating UbcH5cin vitro. Both deletion mutants, as well as a deletion mutant that removed the C-terminal 14 residues (ROC1ΔC14), and two double point mutants within the RING finger, were fused in-frame with an HA epitope tag and inserted into a cytomegalovirus-based mammalian expression vector. Individual plasmids expressing wild type ROC1 and individual ROC1 mutants were co-transfected with T7 epitope-tagged CUL1 into 293T cells. ROC1-CUL1 complex formation was examined by coupled immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Fig. 3B, IP, WB). Both ΔN23 and ΔN41 deletions severely reduced the association of ROC1 with CUL1 (lanes 6 and 7). In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal 14 residues and two double mutations within the RING finger did not detectably affect ROC1-CUL1 binding. Taken together, these results indicate that the N-terminal portion of ROC1 is required for the association with CUL1. To determine whether the N-terminal domain of ROC1 is required for E2 activation, we expressed and purified GST fusion proteins containing these mutations. Both purified GST-ROC1ΔN23 and GST-ROC1ΔN41 activated UbcH5c in vitro at an efficiency similar to that reached by the wild type GST-ROC1 protein. In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal 14 residues or several double mutations within the RING finger completely abolished the E2 activation function of ROC1 (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that the RING domain alone is sufficient to activate UbcH5c and does not require the N-terminal sequence. That the ROC1 alone is sufficient to activate an E2 to synthesize polyubiquitin chain formation in the absence of other ROC1-associated co-factors led us to test whether ROC1 can be crafted onto a heterologous protein and still retain its function to activate an E2. The entire sequence of ROC1 was fused in-frame with CDK4 and a Myc epitope tag. Myc-CDK4-ROC1 fusion protein was immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected 293T cells using anti-Myc antibody and incubated with 32P-labeled ubiquitin in the presence of E1 and UbcH5c. Myc-CDK4-ROC1 exhibited a high level of activity similar to that seen with Myc-ROC1 to activate UbcH5c to synthesize polyubiquitin chains (Fig. 3D, lane 3). Introduction of a double point mutation, C75A/H77A, into the RING finger substantially reduced the polyubiquitin chain formation activity (lane 4). This result further supports the autonomous function of ROC1 in activating E2 and suggests the possibility of engineering RING finger-based chimerical ubiquitin ligases for targeting the ubiquitination and degradation of selected proteins. We next determined whether purified recombinant ROC1 could activate other E2 CDC34. Purified recombinant ROC1, unlike ROC1 immunoprecipitated from mammalian cells, was unable to activate CDC34 (Fig. 4). The simplest explanation is that different E2s may interact distinctly with E3s and that ROC1 immunocomplexes derived from mammalian cells contain an additional factor(s) that is necessary for ROC1 to activate CDC34. One candidate factor is cullin proteins. Consistent with a requirement of cullins in ROC1-mediated CDC34 activation, HA-ROC1 immunocomplexes derived from cells co-transfected with CUL1 are more potent in activating CDC34 than those derived from cells singly transfected with ROC1 (Fig. 4B, compare lane 3with lane 2). Likewise, anti-HA immunocomplexes derived from cells co-transfected with CUL1 and CUL1-binding deficient HA-ROC1ΔN23 did not appreciably activate CDC34 (lane 4). ROC1 has a closely related homologue, ROC2, that also encodes a small H2 type RING finger protein of 113 amino acid residues and interacts with cullins (17Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). To determine whether ROC2, like ROC1, alone can also activate UbcH5c in the absence of a cullin or other cofactors, GST-ROC2 fusion protein was expressed in bacteria, purified to near homogeneity (Fig.2A), and incubated with purified CDC34 or Ubc5Hc proteins in the presence of E1 and 32P-labeled ubiquitin. Similar to ROC1, recombinant GST-ROC2 efficiently activated UbcH5c, but not CDC34, to form polyubiquitin chains (Fig. 4C). Cullin 1/CDC53 represents a multigene family, containing six genes in mammalian cells (cullin 1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, and 5 (Ref. 31Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. He J.P. Wing W.-W. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar)). Different cullins commonly interact with both ROC1 and ROC2 (17Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The findings that ROC1 and ROC2 proteins can autonomously activate E2 suggest the possibility that all cullins, through their association with a ROC protein, could contain ubiquitin ligase activity. We tested this idea by assaying for ubiquitin ligase activity of individual cullin complexes as well as that of ROC2 complexes. We have previously characterized six full-length mammalian cullin cDNAs, CUL1, CUL2, CUL3, mCUL4A, CUL5, and mAPC2 (17Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 27Michel J. Xiong Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 439-445Google Scholar). HA-tagged ROC2 or Myc-tagged cullins were transfected into 293T cells. Cullin and ROC2 complexes were immunoprecipitated using either anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies, respectively, and their associated ubiquitin ligase activities were assayed using CDC34 or UbcH5c as E2 (Fig.5, A and C). Individual cullins were expressed uniformly in 293T cells, and found to associate with similar amounts of endogenous ROC1 as determined by direct immunoblotting of total cell lysates and immunoprecipitation Western analysis (Fig. 5B). When assayed for UBCH5c activation, CUL1 complex exhibited the highest activity, followed by CUL2, CUL3, CUL5, and CUL4A complexes. ROC2 protein displayed preferential association with CUL5, moderate binding with CUL1 and CUL2, and only low level interaction with CUL3 and CUL4A (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that, although ROC1 interacts with different cullins with similar affinity, ROC2 binding is more cullin-specific. ROC2-CUL2 complex appeared to activate UBCH5c most efficiently, followed by ROC2-CUL1, CUL3, and CUL5. Consistent with little association between ROC2 and CUL4A, ROC2 imm"

When the cells were exposed to hyperthermia for l0 min marginal DNA fragmentation and nuclear fragmentation were observed. In the presence of amide-type local anesthetics further enhancement was found depending on concentration. The order of the concentration required for maximum induction was the reverse order of the lipophilicity (prilocaine > lidocaine > bupivacaine). Western blotting revealed that in hyperthermia there was initial release of Ca2+ from the intracellular store site as indicated by increased expression of the type 1 inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. However, the combination with lidocaine did not induce any further enhancement. Lidocaine enhanced the decrease in ATP content and the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in individual cells induced by hyperthermia. In addition, superoxide formation, decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of intracellular caspase-3 were found in the cells treated with hyperthermia and lidocaine. All of these were suppressed in part in the presence of the intracellular Ca2+ ion chelator BAPTA-AM (bis-(O-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N, N, N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl).

The effectiveness of hyperthermia combined with radiotherapy in the treatment of various solid tumors has been demonstrated (1Overgaard J. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol.

Furthermore, recent clinical randomized trials of patients with brain tumors, recurrent or metastatic malignant melanoma, advanced breast carcinoma, locally advanced pelvic tumors, and malignant germ cell tumors clearly have indicated the advantages for patients treated with hyperthermia combined with radiotherapy (2Seegenschmiedt M.H.

In many circumstances the tumor cell killing is insufficient. Drugs that have been discussed as overcoming this difficulty are heat sensitizers. An ideal sensitizer would be nontoxic at normothermia but could become cytotoxic at hyperthermic temperatures. Local anesthetics belong to a class of clinically useful compounds that exert a pharmacological effect by blocking nerve impulse propagation. The involvement of cell membranes as the site for these drug actions has been widely accepted, and many reports showing modification of cell killing due to hyperthermia by LAs 1The abbreviations used are: LAlocal anestheticBAPTA-AMbis-(O-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N, N, N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethylPBSphosphate-buffered salinePIpropidium iodideFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateIRinhibition rateHRHEPES-buffer Ringer solutionMMPmitochondrial membrane potentialIP3Rinositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptorDiOC6(3)3,3-deoxycarbocyanene iodide 1The abbreviations used are: LAlocal anestheticBAPTA-AMbis-(O-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N, N, N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethylPBSphosphate-buffered salinePIpropidium iodideFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateIRinhibition rateHRHEPES-buffer Ringer solutionMMPmitochondrial membrane potentialIP3Rinositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptorDiOC6(3)3,3-deoxycarbocyanene iodide have been published (e.g. potentiation by procaine in murine L5178Y lymphoma cells (8Yau T.M.

Evidence for the cardinal roles of initial release of Ca2+ from intracellular store sites due to hyperthermia and the subsequent increase of [Ca2+]i and the additional activation of the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway in enhancement of apoptosis induced by the combination of hyperthermia and lidocaine will also be presented. In addition the potential usefulness of LAs as sensitizers of heat-induced apoptosis in cancer therapy will be discussed. The human histiocytic lymphoma cell line (U937) was obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resource Bank. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. The cells in log phase (doubling time is 23.5 h) were used for the experiments after confirmation that they were free from any mycoplasma contamination. We added LAs 5 min before heating, and hyperthermic treatments were performed by the immersion of plastic culture tubes containing the cell suspensions (3 ml) in a water bath (NTT-1200, Eyela, Tokyo, Japan) at 44.0 °C (± 0.05 °C). The temperature of the culture medium was monitored with a digital thermometer (#7563, YOKOGAWA, Tokyo, Japan) coupled with a 0.8-mm thermocouple. The amount of DNA extracted from cells that had undergone DNA fragmentation was assayed using the method of Sellins and Cohen (14Sellins K.S. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3199-3206PubMed Google Scholar) with a few modifications (15Hopcia K.L. McCarey Y.L. Sylvester F.C. Held K.D. Radiat. Res. 1996; 145: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Subsequently, each DNA sample in the supernatant and the pellet was precipitated in 12.5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C and quantified using a diphenylamine reagent after hydrolysis in 5% trichloroacetic acid at 90 °C for 20 min. The percentage of fragmented DNA in each sample was calculated as the amount of DNA in the supernatant divided by the total DNA for that sample (supernatant plus pellet). Significance was assessed by a two-way analysis of variance followed by a Fisher's PLSD test and was assumed for p values <0.05. DNA was extracted from the treated cells using a Sepa Gene DNA extraction kit (Sanko Junyaku Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and digested with RNase A (50 μg/ml, Sigma) in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA). The purified DNA (1–3 μg/lane) was electrophoresed for 60 min at 100 V in a 0.8% neutral agarose gel, and DNA-laddering was visualized by staining with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and UVB illumination (16Kimura C. Zhao Q.L. Kondo T. Amatsu M. Fujiwara Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,17Li M. Kondo T. Zhao Q.L. Li F.J. Tanabe K. Arai Y. Zhou Z.C. Kasuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39702-39709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To identify the apoptotic cells after exposure to hyperthermia, the cells harvested after 6 h of incubation at 37 °C were washed with Dulbecco's PBS and collected by centrifugation. The cells were fixed with methanol and acetic acid (3:1) and spread on glass slides. After drying staining was performed with 3% Giemsa solution (pH 6.8) for 15 min. The apoptotic cells were determined by counting a total of 1,000 cells per sample in randomly selected areas. Because annexin V is a human protein with a molecular mass of 36 kDa and a high affinity for phosphatidylserine on the cell membrane, a FITC-labeled annexin V kit (Immunotech, Marseilles, France) was used to detect phosphatidylserine expression on the cell membrane as an end point of early apoptosis (18van Heerde W.L. de Groot P.G. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The samples were washed in cooled PBS at 4 °C and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The resulting pellets were adjusted to 106 cells/ml with the binding buffer from a FITC-labeled annexin V kit. FITC-labeled annexin V (5 μl) and PI (5 μl) were added to the suspension (490 μl) and mixed gently. After incubation for 10 min in the dark the cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer (Epics XL, Beckman-Coulter, Miami, FL). The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with HR (NaCl, 118 mm; KCl, 4.7 mm; CaCl2, 2.5 mm; MgCl2, 1.13 mm; Na2HPO4, 1.0 mm; glucose, 5.5 mm, and HEPES, 10 mm). The buffer was supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), minimal Eagle's essential amino acids (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK), and 2 mm l-glutamine. Approximately 3 × 105 cells in 3 ml of HR were loaded with 5 mmFura-2/AM (Dojindo Lab., Kumamoto, Japan) for 30 min at 25 °C. The cells loaded with Fura-2/AM were washed once with HR and twice with the growth medium. Following centrifugation the cells were transferred to a tube containing the culture medium with or without lidocaine (Sigma). After hyperthermia the cells were washed with HR, and an aliquot of cell suspensions (10 ml) was transferred onto a glass-bottomed dish coated with Cell-Tak (Genome Therapeutics). After addition of HR to the dish, digital imaging of Fura-2 fluorescence was carried out using an inverted microscope and a digital image processor (Argus 50/Ca, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) as reported previously (19Habara H. Kanno T. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Kondo T. Kano E. Habara Y. Kanno T.

The fluorescence ratio (340 nm/380 nm) at 510 nm of emission wavelength was converted to [Ca2+]i using the equation of Grynkiewicz et al. (22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Significance was assessed by Mann-Whitney test and was assumed for p values <0.05. DiOC6(3) was employed for examining MMP. After treatment with hyperthermia combined with or without lidocaine cells were washed twice with PBS and were exposed to 40 nmDiOC6(3) (Wako Pure Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) in 1 ml PBSF (PBS plus 1% fetal bovine serum) for 15 min at 37 °C. The fraction of cells showing low MMP was measured by flow cytometry. The cells were lysed at a density of 106 cells per 20 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min. After brief sonication the lysates were centrifuged, and protein content in the supernatant was measured using a Bio-Rad protein system. Western blot analyses of IP3R (1Overgaard J. Int. J. Radiat.

Superoxide anion levels were measured using the method employed by Gorman et al. (23Gorman A. McGowan A. Cotter T.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We used the dye, hydroethidine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) which is oxidized by superoxide anion radicals within the cell, which fluoresces when it intercalates into DNA. Briefly, the cells (106 cells/ml) were incubated with 2 μm hydroethidine for 15 min at 37 °C. After a second washing levels of the intracellular superoxide anion radicals were assessed using flow cytometry. The cell-permeable fluorogenic substrate (PhiPhiLux-G1D2) was used to monitor the intracellular caspase-3 activity according to the manufacturer's recommendations (OncoImmunin, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, the sample (106 cells/ml) was gently centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resuspended with 50 μl of 10 μm PhiPhiLux-G1D2 substrate solution in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark the samples were washed once and diluted with 0.5 ml of ice-cold flow cytometry dilution buffer. The fraction of cells showing high caspase-3 activities was measured by flow cytometry (24Zapta J.M. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6916-6920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Intracellular ATP level was measured using a CheckLite plus 250 kit (Kikkoman, Tokyo, Japan). After treatment the cells were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 2 min, and the filtrate was removed. A cell suspension (2 × 105 cells/200 μl) was added to the lysis buffer (200 μl) and was kept for 5 min at 25 °C. Afterward the absorbency of ATP, which was included in 100 μl of the cell suspension, was measured by the administration of 100 μl of the emission reagent. The intracellular ATP concentration was calculated from the standard curve (from 2 × 10−7 m to 2 × 10−10 m concentration of ATP). Significance was assessed by a two-way analysis of variance followed by a Fisher's PLSD test and was assumed for p values <0.05. To study the ability of LAs to potentiate hyperthermia-induced apoptosis, DNA fragmentation was examined when U937 cells were treated with hyperthermia combined with three kinds of amide-type LAs (lidocaine, bupivacaine, or prilocaine), which have different lipophilicities. Fig. 1 shows the effects of graded concentrations of LAs on the DNA fragmentation when the cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C after treatment with or without hyperthermia at 44 °C for 10 min. The apparent enhancement of hyperthermia-induced DNA fragmentation by LAs was observed at concentrations of more than 0.5 mm. The order of concentration of LAs for the maximum DNA fragmentation was prilocaine > lidocaine > bupivacaine, and this was the reverse order of lipophilicity and potency as anesthetic agents (25Scurr C. Feldman S. Sone N. Scientific Foundation of Anesthesia. Year Book Medical Publishers, Inc., Chicago1990: 636-641Google Scholar). When the cells were treated with LAs at 37 °C no DNA fragmentation induced by prilocaine was observed. In contrast, lidocaine and bupivacaine increased DNA fragmentation at concentrations more than 2 and 1.5 mm, respectively. In addition, the DNA fragmentation induced by bupivacaine decreased at a concentration of 1.5 mm. Because lidocaine is more effective with less toxicity among the LAs in this study, it was used for the following experiments. The enhancement of DNA ladder formation after treatment with hyperthermia and lidocaine was observed (Fig. 2). When the samples of cells stained with Giemsa were examined under a light microscope a marked enhancement of apoptotic change in the nuclei, especially nuclear fragmentation, was observed in the samples treated with hyperthermia and lidocaine, although hyperthermia alone induced marginal changes (Fig. 3, A–D). The percentage of cells containing fragmented nuclei after the combined treatments was 3× higher than those of the samples treated with hyperthermia (Fig. 3 E). These results of DNA ladder formation and cell morphology such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation consistently revealed that lidocaine enhanced apoptosis induced by hyperthermia in U937 cells.Figure 3Apoptotic features induced by the combination with hyperthermia and lidocaine in U937 cells. After treatment with hyperthermia (44 °C, 10 min) in the presence or absence of 1 mm lidocaine, cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. They were collected for Giemsa staining and examined under a microscope at a magnification of ×400.

This phosphatidylserine externalization is an early sign of apoptosis (Fig. 4). At 6 h, the percentage of early apoptosis, i.e. annexin V(+)/PI(−) cells, induced by the combined treatment (52.0 ± 5.0, mean ± S.D., n = 3) was significantly higher than that in the cells treated with hyperthermia alone (16.3 ± 6.3). In contrast, the percentage of secondary necrosis, i.e. annexin V(+)/PI(+), was small and was less than 20% even in the cells treated with hyperthermia and lidocaine. Because U937 cells have been reported to possess a Ca2+-dependent apoptosis pathway (16Kimura C. Zhao Q.L. Kondo T. Amatsu M. Fujiwara Y. Exp.

The average [Ca2+]i was 83.8 ± 38.7 nm in the control cells (mean ± S.D., n = 500), 77.3 ± 44.2 nm in the cells treated with lidocaine alone, 100.5 ± 61.6 nm in the cells treated with hyperthermia alone, and 140.4 ± 119.8 nm in the cells treated with hyperthermia and lidocaine. As shown in Fig. 5, E–H(histograms of [Ca2+]i in 500 randomly selected cells) the distribution in the non-treated control cells and in the cells treated with lidocaine alone was relatively uniform. In contrast when the cells were treated with hyperthermia, especially when combined with lidocaine, the number of cells containing higher [Ca2+]i increased markedly. Because the [Ca2+]i in ∼95% of control cells was less than 135 nm, the fraction of cells showing above 135 nm was calculated and evaluated for statistical significance. No significant difference in the fraction of cells containing above 135 nm between the control (3.3 ± 5.9%, mean ± S.D., n = 5) and the cells treated with lidocaine (6.0 ± 7.1%) was observed. When the cells were treated with hyperthermia the fraction of cells showing higher [Ca2+]i (16.7 ± 7.1%) increased significantly compared with the control (p < 0.05). Furthermore, when the cells were treated with hyperthermia combined with lidocaine the fraction of cells (31.0 ± 20.3%) increased significantly compared with the cells treated with hyperthermia (p < 0.01). These results indicate that lidocaine further increased the hyperthermia-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. To explore reasons why the [Ca2+]i increased when the cells were treated with hyperthermia combined with the presence or absence of lidocaine, the expression of IP3R proteins (types 1 and 3), which is known to be related to intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (26Khan A.A. Soloski M.J. Sharp A.H. Schilling G. Sabatini D.M. Li S.H. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 273: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 27Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), was examined. Western blotting of whole cell extracts with IP3R-specific antibody showed that proteins of IP3R1 were slightly expressed in the U937 cells and therefore the expression was increased with hyperthermia alone immediately after the treatment (Fig. 6). However, no further increase was observed in the cells treated with hyperthermia and lidocaine. In contrast, no expression of IP3R3 was detected in the control cells and in the cells treated with hyperthermia combined with the presence or absence of lidocaine. The increase in [Ca2+]i induced by hyperthermia caused by the elevation of IP3R1 expression was revealed. This finding suggests that the intracellular release of Ca2+ from store sites induced by hyperthermia is a reason for the initial increase in [Ca2+]i. To examine whether the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway for apoptosis is related to the enhancement of hyperthermia-induced apoptosis by lidocaine or not, we measured the MMP change, the intracellular superoxide anion radical level, and the intracellular caspase-3 activities. When the cells were treated with hyperthermia in the presence of lidocaine and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h, cells with low MMP (Fig. 7), a high level of superoxide anion radicals, and high activities of caspase-3 (Fig. 8) increased significantly. The percentage of cells with high superoxide anion radical levels was 1.8 ± 0.4% in the control cells (mean ± S.D.,n = 3), 3.9 ± 2.5% in the cells treated with lidocaine alone, 4.4 ± 0.5% in the cells treated with hyperthermia, and 57.4 ± 15.4% in the cells treated with hyperthermia and lidocaine. These results confirmed our hypothesis that the activation of mitochondria-caspase pathway is involved in the enhancement of hyperthermia-induced apoptosis by lidocaine.Figure 8Increase of caspase-3 activity after hyperthermia combined with lidocaine. After treatment with hyperthermia (44 °C, 10 min) in the presence or absence of 1 mm lidocaine, cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. They were stained with PhiPhiLux-G1D2 as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and then caspase activity was measured by flow cytometry.

Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1835-1840PubMed Google Scholar, 29Eguchi Y. Srinivasan A. Tomaselli K.J. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2174-2181PubMed Google Scholar) and our result shows that mitochondria are related to the enhancement of hyperthermia-induced apoptosis by lidocaine, the ATP concentration in cells treated with various concentrations of lidocaine with or without hyperthermia was measured 3 h after treatment (Fig. 9). An increasing concentration of lidocaine induced a gradual decrease in ATP concentration at 37 °C. However, hyperthermia reduced ATP concentration to a level similar to that attained when lidocaine alone was used and significantly decreased it furthermore to 11.2 ± 3.4% (mean ± S.D.,n = 4) from 100% of the control when 5 mmlidocaine was added. To examine the role of [Ca2+]i on the enhancement of hyperthermia-induced apoptosis by lidocaine, a cytosolic free Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA-AM, was utilized. When cells were treated and incubated for 6 h in the presence of BAPTA-AM at a concentration of 50 μm, the inhibition rates (IRs) by BAPTA-AM on DNA fragmentation, on the fraction of cells expressing superoxide formation, on cells with low MMP, and on cells with activated caspase-3 were obtained. IR was calculated as: IR (%) = [(FHL−FHLB)/FHL] × 100, where FHL is percent in the cells treated with hyperthermia and lidocaine and FHLB is percent in the cells treated with hyperthermia and lidocaine in the presence of BAPTA-AM. BAPTA-AM significantly reduced these end points of apoptosis induced by hyperthermia and lidocaine. The IR on DNA fragmentation, on the fraction of cells expressing superoxide formation, on cells with low mitochondria membrane potential, and on cells with activated caspase-3 are 60.9 ± 5.1% (mean ± S.D., n = 5), 50.9 ± 5.2% (mean ± S.D., n = 5), 42.9 ± 8.6% (mean ± S.D., n = 4), and 38.0 ± 17.6% (mean ± S.D., n = 3), respectively (Fig. 10). In contrast, the reduced ATP concentration in cells treated with hyperthermia and lidocaine further decreased by 75.7 ± 5.2% in the presence of BAPTA-AM. LAs have been reported to enhance cell killing induced by hyperthermia either in vitro or in vivo (10Yatvin M.B. Clifton K.H. Dennis W.H. Science. 1979; 205: 195-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Robins H.I. Dennis W.H Slattery J. Lange T.A. Yatvin M.B. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3187-3191PubMed Google Scholar,30Robins H.I. Dennis W.H. Martin P.A. Sondel P.M. Yatvin M.B. Steeves R.A. Cancer. 1984; 54: 2831-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that LAs interact extensively with the cell membrane. For example, LAs induce disorders among the lipid part of the cell membrane, fluidizing and expanding it by nonspecific binding (13Kingston C.A. Ladha S. Manning R. Bowler K. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 2235-2240Google Scholar, 31Ueda I. Tashiro C. Arakawa K. Anesthesiology. 1977; 46: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). LAs raise the intracellular calcium ion level (32Coss R.A. Felgar R.E. Stokes D.G. Smith N.N. Int. J. Hyperth. 1989; 5: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 33Butterworth J.F. Strichartz G.R. Anesthesiology. 1990; 72: 711-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), inhibit Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase activity (34Senisterra G.A. Lepock J.R. Int. J. Hyperth. 2000; 16: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and reduce the mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism (35Bruno T. Gentile F.P., Di Padova M. Antonucci E. Rubiu O. Dolo V. Pavan A. Floridi A. Oncol. Res. 1998; 10: 143-150PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which LAs potentiate hyperthermic damage to cells is not clearly understood, and little is known about the modification of hyperthermia-induced apoptosis by LAs. The present results reveal that the mechanism of enhancement of hyperthermia-induced apoptosis by lidocaine involves increasing the initial release of Ca2+ from intracellular store sites caused by hyperthermia and a subsequent increase in [Ca2+]i, and the results also reveal that activation of a mitochondria-caspase pathway is accompanied by a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, superoxide production, and activation of caspase-3 (See Fig. 11). The cytotoxic effects of hyperthermia as measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method (13Kingston C.A. Ladha S. Manning R. Bowler K. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 2235-2240Google Scholar) were enhanced by subtoxic levels of anesthetics, and the potency of these effects was related to their respective lipophilicity (13Kingston C.A. Ladha S. Manning R. Bowler K. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 2235-2240Google Scholar, 25Scurr C. Feldman S. Sone N. Scientific Foundation of Anesthesia. Year Book Medical Publishers, Inc., Chicago1990: 636-641Google Scholar). Fluidization of the hydrophobic core of the membrane may contribute to anesthetic potentiation of heat-induced cell death (13Kingston C.A. Ladha S. Manning R. Bowler K. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 2235-2240Google Scholar). In addition, bupivacaine (because of its high lipophilicity) penetrated the cell membrane, reached the mitochondria to induce deep ultrastructural modifications, and lowered the MMP (35Bruno T. Gentile F.P., Di Padova M. Antonucci E. Rubiu O. Dolo V. Pavan A. Floridi A. Oncol. Res. 1998; 10: 143-150PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the order of the concentration of LAs for the maximum DNA fragmentation at 44 °C was in the reverse order of their lipophilicity. LAs with high lipophilicity may cause much more sensitization of cells to hyperthermia by interacting with and destabilizing membranes so that fluidity is increased, because higher lipophilicity makes it easy for LAs to integrate in the cell membrane. Therefore, LAs with higher lipophilicity appear to cause greater enhancement of hyperthermia-induced apoptosis. When the cells were treated with hyperthermia and lidocaine in the range of toxic concentrations a decrease in DNA fragmentation, early apoptosis, and an increase in secondary necrosis were observed. It is well known that a fall in ATP eventually causes various cellular abnormalities, which may lead to cell death (28Eguchi Y. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1835-1840PubMed Google Scholar), and changes the type of cell death from apoptosis to necrosis (29Eguchi Y. Srinivasan A. Tomaselli K.J. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2174-2181PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the decrease in intracellular ATP concentration is related to this change of cell death from apoptosis to necrosis. In this study the promotion of a decrease in the intracellular ATP concentration and a subsequent drop in DNA fragmentation by hyperthermia combined with lidocaine was observed. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration after treatment of hyperthermia combined with lidocaine and the suppression of DNA fragmentation by a Ca2+ chelator (BAPTA-AM) suggest that a Ca2+-dependent pathway is involved in the enhancement of hyperthermia-induced apoptosis by lidocaine. The small increase in [Ca2+]i after hyperthermia appears to be caused by an initial release of Ca2+ (derived from the intracellular storage sites) because expression of IP3R1 was up-regulated immediately after hyperthermia. Subsequently, the decrease in intracellular ATP concentration facilitated by lidocaine led to a rapid decline in the Ca2+-ATPase activity, and the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ due to an abatement of Ca2+ exclusion (33Butterworth J.F. Strichartz G.R. Anesthesiology. 1990; 72: 711-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) appears to cause the activation of Ca2+-dependent endonucleases and proteases in apoptosis. Involvement of the mitochondrial caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway was also indicated because of the lowering of the mitochondrial membrane potential, the increase in O2− production, and the activation of intracellular caspase-3. There have been some reports that LAs alone with high lipophilicity could reach mitochondria (36Grouselle M. Tueux O. Dabadie P. Georgescaud D. Mazat J.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and that LAs not only induce uncoupling of mitochondria by an electrophoretic mechanism but also inhibit adenine nucleotide transport in mitochondria (37Karniel M. Beitner R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 69: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Another study has reported that LAs at high concentrations induced apoptosis and appear to be related to activation of the mitochondria-caspase pathway, but they may not interact directly with mitochondria in HL-60 cells to induce apoptosis (38Arita K. Utsumi T. Kato A. Kanno T. Kobuchi H. Inoue B. Akiyama J. Utsumi K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because LAs at toxic concentrations induced apoptosis dependent on the mitochondria-caspase pathway whether they interacted with the mitochondria directly or indirectly, it is possible that hyperthermia further enhanced activation of the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway in apoptosis induced by LAs even at lower nontoxic concentrations. To understand better the significance of the increase in [Ca2+]i in cells treated with hyperthermia and lidocaine, various parameters of the mitochondrial caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway were examined in the presence of a cytosolic free Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA-AM, at a concentration of 50 μm (because 50 μmBAPTA-AM has shown significant inhibition of hyperthermia-induced DNA fragmentation in U937 cells) (21Kameda K. Kondo T. Tanabe K. Zhao Q.L. Seto H. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2001; 49: 1369-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When cells were treated and incubated for 6 h in the presence of BAPTA-AM, enhancement of DNA fragmentation by lidocaine combined with hyperthermia was decreased by 60.9 ± 5.1%. In addition decreases in MMP, superoxide formation, and activation of intracellular caspase-3 by hyperthermia combined with lidocaine were suppressed by approximately 40–50% (Fig. 10). These results indicate that the rise in intracellular free Ca2+ takes part not only in the Ca2+-dependent pathway but also in the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway. In addition because a series of parameters on the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway in cells treated with hyperthermia and lidocaine was suppressed by BAPTA-AM, direct involvement of intracellular free Ca2+ upon the mitochondria is suggested. These results support the view that elevations in cytosolic Ca2+ act directly on mitochondria to induce the rupture of the outer membrane and the release of caspase activation proteins (reviewed in Ref. 39Green R.G. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the reduced intracellular ATP concentration (another parameter that relates to mitochondrial function and cell death) in the cells treated with hyperthermia and lidocaine was further decreased by 75.7 ± 5.2% in the presence of BAPTA-AM. However, when cells were treated with BAPTA-AM alone the ATP concentration was decreased very markedly by 93.2 ± 1.4%. For this reason, the relationship between the rise in intracellular free Ca2+ and the decrease in intracellular ATP concentration in the cells treated with hyperthermia combined with lidocaine has not been resolved. Therefore, the role of intracellular ATP in the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway cannot be fully established because BAPTA-AM did not prevent the decrease of ATP concentration. The molecular mechanism of the enhancement of apoptosis by LAs at hyperthermic temperature has not been established. However, we obtained evidence for the cardinal roles of the initial release of Ca2+ from intracellular store sites caused by hyperthermia and the subsequent increase of [Ca2+]i and for the additional activation of the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway, which was partly regulated by intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the enhancement of apoptosis induced by the combination of hyperthermia and lidocaine. In conclusion we present the possible effectiveness of the use of LAs in cancer treatment in combination with hyperthermia. LAs enhance hyperthermia-induced apoptosis at non-cytotoxic concentrations when applied alone. It is hoped that a better understanding of the mechanism of apoptosis induced by hyperthermia and LAs, which are well known in pharmacology and toxicology and for which there is extensive clinical experience, will lead to the development of better strategies for use in cancer therapy.

It is an outer membrane mitochondrial enzyme existing in two isoforms, A and B. We have recently generated 14 site-directed mutants of human MAO A and B, and we found that four key amino acids, Lys-305, Trp-397, Tyr-407, and Tyr-444, in MAO A and their corresponding amino acids in MAO B, Lys-296, Trp-388, Tyr-398, and Tyr-435, play important roles in MAO catalytic activity. Based on the polyamine oxidase three-dimensional crystal structure, it is suggested that Lys-305, Trp-397, and Tyr-407 in MAO A and Lys-296, Trp-388, and Tyr-398 in MAO B may be involved in the non-covalent binding to FAD. Tyr-407 and Tyr-444 in MAO A (Tyr-398 and Tyr-435 in MAO B) may form an aromatic sandwich that stabilizes the substrate binding. Asp-132 in MAO A (Asp-123 in MAO B) located at the entrance of the U-shaped substrate-binding site has no effect on MAO A nor MAO B catalytic activity.

Recently, it has been shown that MAO may contribute to the apoptotic process because inhibition of MAO activity suppressed cell death (6.De Zutter G.S. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6168-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). monoamine oxidase polyamine oxidase serotonin MAO exists in two forms, namely MAO A and MAO B. MAO A preferentially oxidizes serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and is irreversibly inhibited by low concentrations of clorgyline (7.Johnson J.P. Biochem.

MAO B preferentially oxidizes phenylethylamine (PEA) and benzylamine, and it is irreversibly inactivated by low concentrations of pargyline and deprenyl (8.Knoll J. Magyar K. Adv. Biochem.

MAO A and B consist of 527 and 520 amino acids, respectively, and have a 70% identity (9.Back A.W. Lan N.C. Johnson D.L. Abell C.W. Bembenek M.E. Kwan S.W. Seeburg Ph.D. Shih J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

MAO B inhibitors have been used for Parkinson's disease. Knowledge of the tertiary structure of MAO A and B will be of great value for the rational design of new effective drugs. Furthermore, there is a large body of biochemical and other data that await interpretation when the three-dimensional structures of MAO A and MAO B are available. Recently, the x-ray crystal structure of a related enzyme namely polyamine oxidase (PAO) has been obtained (25.Binda C. Coda A. Angelini R. Federico R. Ascenzi P. Mattevi A. Struct. Fold Design. 1999; 7: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (164) Google Scholar). PAO catalyzes the oxidation of the secondary amino group of polyamines, such as spermine and spermidine. Polyamines are DNA-binding molecules that play an important role in cell growth and development (26.Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev.

The role of PAO in polyamine catabolism made it an important drug target because some polyamine analogs have been shown to have an antitumor effect on some cell lines (28.Pegg A.E. Hu R.H. Cancer Lett. 1995; 95: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PAO is a monomeric and soluble 500-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of about 53 kDa and contains a non-covalently bound FAD as a cofactor. It has been classified along with MAO as part of a flavoprotein superfamily having a common 50-amino acid FAD-binding signature motif near the N terminus (29.Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13658-13662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PAO shares a 20% amino acid identity with MAO and catalyzes the same chemical reaction: an oxidation half-reaction of an amine to an imine coupled to the reduction of O2 to H2O2. These properties suggest that MAO and PAO have similar FAD- and substrate-binding sites. We have used the PAO structure as a guide to study the FAD-binding amino acids and the substrate-binding site of MAO. We have aligned amino acids involved with FAD-binding and the active site of PAO with MAO A and B from several species to identify conserved amino acids. Only conserved amino acids that, according to the PAO structure, mediate their function through their side chain and not their main chain atoms have been mutated. This criteria allowed us to identify two amino acids, a lysine and a tryptophan (Lys-305 and Trp-397 in MAO A and Lys-296 and Trp-388 in MAO B), which may play an important role in the noncovalent FAD attachment to MAO. These residues have been mutated to alanine and were named MAO A-K305A, MAO A-W397A, MAO B-K296A, and MAO B-W388A, respectively. We have also predicted the existence of a critical feature of the substrate-binding site of MAO based on PAO structure. It is an aromatic sandwich that consists of the side chains of two parallel tyrosine residues facing the substrate-binding pocket on opposite sides. We have mutated these tyrosines to both phenylalanine and to serine in MAO A and B in order to ascertain the validity of this aromatic sandwich structure. A mutation to phenylalanine is to the removal of the hydroxyl group from tyrosine, whereas a mutation to serine represents the removal of the aromatic portion. An amino acid associated with the active site of PAO but whose function is not well defined, Glu-120, is conserved in all MAOs. We have mutated this amino acid to alanine in MAO A and B. The mutants were expressed, and their activities and sensitivities toward inhibitors were determined. We have also performed molecular modeling studies of MAO A and B using PAO as a template. This model is supported by the site-directed mutagenesis data and suggests that the overall three-dimensional structure and active sites of MAO A and B may be similar. Full-length human MAO A and B cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pVL1392-transfer vector and named pVL1392-hMAOA and pVL1392-hMAOB, respectively. The clone was verified for proper insertion by restriction digest analysis. Recombinant MAO A and B encoding virus was produced by homologous recombination and cotransfection of Sf21 insect cells with the transfer vector and the linearized baculovirus DNA via the calcium phosphate method. Recombinant baculovirus was isolated by plaque purification and amplified by infection of insect cells with a multiplicity of infection = 1. After 4 passes a viral stock with a titer of 108 plaque-forming units/ml was produced. The point mutants in MAO A (D132A, K305A, W397A, Y407F, Y407S, Y444F, and Y444S) and MAO B (D123A, K296A, W388A, Y398F, Y398S, Y435F, and Y435S) were made on pVL1392-hMAOA and pVL1392-hMAOB. The QuikChange™site-directed mutagenesis kit was used. The protocol of the kit was followed except that an annealing temperature of 52 °C was used. The following complementary 5′-primers for 14 point mutations of MAO A and MAO B were used as follows: 1) MAO A-D132A, GGAGGACAATAGCTAACATGGGGAAGG and CCTTCCCCATGTTAGCTATTGTCCTCC; 2) MAO A-K305A, GGGAGCTGTCATTGCGTGCATGATG and CATCATGCACGCAATGACAGCTCCC; 3) MAO A-W397A, GAAGAGAAGAACGCGTGTGAGGAGCAG and CTGCTCCTCACACGCGTTCTTCTCTTC; 4) MAO A-Y407F, CTGGGGGCTGCTTCACGGCCTACTTC and GAAGTAGGCCGTGAAGCAGCCCCCAG; 5) MAO A-Y407S, CTGGGGGCTGCTCCACGGCCTACTTC and GAAGTAGGCCGTGGAGCAGCCCCCAG; 6) MAO A-Y444F, GTGGAGCGGCTTCATGGAAGGGGC and GCCCCTTCCATGAAGCCGCTCCAC; 7) MAO A-Y444S, GTGGAGCGGCTCCATGGAAGGGGC and GCCCCTTCCATGGAGCCGCTCCAC; 8) MAO B-D123A, GGAGGACAATGGAGGACATGGGGCG and CGCCCCATGTCCTCCATTGTCCTCC; 9) MAO B-K296A, GGGTTCAGTCATCGCGTGTATAGTTTATTATAAAG and CTTTATAATAAACTATACACGCGATGACTGAACCC; 10) MAOB-W388A, TATGAAGAAAAGAACGCGTGTGAGGAGCAGTAC and GTACTGCTCCTCACACGCGTTCTTTTCTTCATA; 11) MAO B-Y398F, CTCTGGGGGCTGCTTCACAACTTATTTCCCCCC and GGGGGGAAATAAGTTGTGAAGCAGCCCCCAGAG; 12) MAO B-Y398S, CTCTGGGGGCTGCTCCACAACTTATTTCCCCCC and GGGGGGAAATAAGTTGTGGAGCAGCCCCCAGAG; 13) MAO B-Y435F, GCCACACACTGGAGCGGCTTCATGGAGGGGGCTG and CAGCCCCCTCCATGAAGCCGCTCCAGTGTGTGGC; 14) MAO B-Y435S, GCCACACACTGGAGCGGCTCCATGGAGGGGGCTG and CAGCCCCCTCCATGGAGCCGCTCCAGTGTGTGGC. The mutagenic bases are underlined. The introduction of the mutation was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing analysis of the region of interest. Small scale expression of various mutants of MAO A and MAO B was carried out in adherent culture of Sf21 cells. 150-mm cell culture dishes were seeded with 20 × 106 Sf21 cells, and recombinant virus was added at a multiplicity of infection of 2. The cells were incubated at 27 °C for 72–80 h and then harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 × g. The kinetic constants for the oxidation of 5-HT and PEA and the inhibition by clorgyline and deprenyl were determined by the radiochemical method as described previously (30.Wurtman R.J. Axelrod J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1964; 12: 1439-1441Crossref Scopus (791) Google Scholar) using O2-saturated 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer. For the K mdetermination, [14C]5-HT and [14C]PEA concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 5 times the K mvalues that were determined via Eadie-Hofstee plot (v versus v/[S]). The k catvalues were calculated from the V max values obtained by fitting the [S] versus activity curve to the Michaelis-Menten equation and the calculated concentration of the enzyme from the quantitation assay. The IC50 values for the irreversible inhibitors clorgyline and deprenyl were determined by preincubating the inhibitor with the homogenate for 30 min at 37 °C and assaying for the remaining activity as described above. Sequences were retrieved from the Swiss Protein Database. Coordinates of the crystal structure of PAO are available at the Protein Database (code 1b5q). Sequence alignments were performed with Matchbox (31.Depiereux E. Baudoux G. Briffeuil P. Reginster I. De Bolle X. Vinals C. Feytmans E. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 249-256PubMed Google Scholar). Comparative modeling of both forms of MAOs was performed using the Homology module (Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego). Energy minimization (steepest descent and conjugated gradient algorithms; gradient on energies less than 1 kcal/mol used as convergence criteria) was done using the consistent valence force field and the Discover program (Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego). A distance-dependent dielectric constant (1·r) was used to simulate solvent effects. Geometry was checked with Procheck (32.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). All calculations were carried out on an Octane SGI Work station running under Irix 6.2. We have assayed the seven MAO A mutants and the wild type for activity using the MAO A substrate serotonin (5-HT) (Table I). MAO A-K305A and MAO A-W397A did not show detectable activity even when the amount of protein in the assay was increased to 100 times that of MAO A wild type. These results suggest that Lys-305 and Trp-397 in MAO A play a critical role in enzyme activity.Table IActivities of MAO A active site mutantsEnzymeActivityK mnmol 5-HT/min/mgμm 5-HTMAO A wild type61.3 ± 3.386.3 ± 7.3MAO A-D132A57.2 ± 2.5186.6 ± 23.6MAO A-K305ANot detectableNot detectableMAO A-W397ANot detectableNot detectableMAO A-Y407F34.9 ± 1.9120.0 ± 17.6MAO A-Y407SNot detectableNot detectableMAO A-Y444F<0.1Not determined1-aActivity was too low to determine K m values.MAO A-Y444SNot detectableNot detectable1-a Activity was too low to determine K m values. Open table in a new tab MAO A-Y407S exhibited no activity, whereas MAO A-Y407F had ∼50% of wild type activity. The K m value of MAO A-Y407F was slightly increased. Similarly, mutant MAO A-Y444S did not show any catalytic activity, whereas the mutant MAO A-Y407F had low activity. These results indicate that the two tyrosines at positions 407 and 444 can be replaced by phenylalanine to retain some activity but not by serine. This implies an important role for the aromatic ring of tyrosine. MAO A-D132A had an activity similar to that of the wild type, and the K m value was slightly increased. This suggests that Asp-132 is not important for the catalytic activity of MAO A. We have also determined the inhibitor sensitivities of all the active mutants toward the MAO A-specific inhibitor clorgyline and the MAO B-specific inhibitor deprenyl (Table II). For clorgyline, MAO A-D132A and MAO A-Y407F had the same sensitivity as the wild type, and MAO A-Y444F showed about a 10-fold decrease in sensitivity. For deprenyl, MAO A-D132A showed a slight decrease in sensitivity, and MAO A-Y407F and MAO A-Y444F showed about a 10-fold decrease. Therefore MAO A-Y444F shows a decreased sensitivity for both inhibitors, whereas MAO A-D132A and MAO A-Y407F show a decreased sensitivity toward deprenyl only. This suggests that these amino acids are not essential but do affect the enzyme activity.Table IIInhibition constants of MAO A and B active site mutantsEnzymeClorgyline IC50Deprenyl IC50mMAO A wild type1.2 ± 0.5 × 10−92.3 ± 1.2 × 10−6MAO A-D132A2.2 ± 0.8 × 10−98.9 ± 4.2 × 10−6MAO A-Y407F2.3 ± 1.3 × 10−92.5 ± 1.5 × 10−5MAO A-Y444F1.9 ± 1.5 × 10−82.4 ± 0.4 × 10−5MAO B wild type4.2 ± 2.1 × 10−73.3 ± 1.4 × 10−9MAO B-D123A1.4 ± 0.3 × 10−61.1 ± 0.4 × 10−8MAO B-Y398F3.3 ± 0.9 × 10−65.1 ± 2.0 × 10−8MAO B-Y435F3.6 ± 1.0 × 10−64.3 ± 2.1 × 10−7 Open table in a new tab The seven corresponding mutants were also made on MAO B, and the activity toward the MAO B substrate PEA was assayed (Table III). Interestingly, the results were similar to the MAO A mutants. MAO B-K296A and MAO B-W388A resulted in a complete loss of activity. MAO B-Y398S was also inactive, but MAO B-Y398F retained activity with a slight increase inK m value. Similarly, MAO B-Y435S was inactive, and MAO B-Y435F retained activity with an increase inK m.Table IIIActivities of MAO B active site mutantsEnzymeActivityKmnmol PEA/min/mgμm PEAMAO B wild type27.2 ± 3.02.2 ± 0.5MAO B-D123A24.0 ± 2.25.2 ± 2.1MAO B-K296ANot detectableNot detectableMAO B-W388ANot detectableNot detectableMAO B-Y398F19.7 ± 3.87.8 ± 2.5MAO B-Y398SNot detectableNot detectableMAO B-Y435F3.5 ± 0.421.1 ± 2.0MAO B-Y435SNot detectableNot detectable Open table in a new tab As for its MAO A counterpart, MAO B-D123A had an activity similar to that of the wild type which suggests that Asp-123 is not important for the catalytic activity of MAO B. All three active mutants, MAO B-D123A, MAO B-Y398F, and MAO B-Y435F, showed a decrease in sensitivity toward clorgyline and deprenyl. MAO B-Y435F showed an especially marked decrease in sensitivity of about 100-fold toward deprenyl. This suggests that these mutants affect the active site. Our results show that Lys-305, Trp-397, Tyr-407, and Tyr-444 in MAO A and their corresponding amino acids in MAO B, Lys-296, Trp-388, Tyr-398, and Tyr-435, play an important role in MAO catalytic activity. Based on the polyamine oxidase three-dimensional structure, it is suggested that Lys-305 and Trp-397 in MAO A and their corresponding amino acids in MAO B, Lys-296 and Trp-388, may be involved in the non-covalent binding to FAD. Tyr-407 and Tyr-444 in MAO A (Tyr-398 and Tyr-435 in MAO B) form an aromatic sandwich within the substrate-binding site. Asp-132 in MAO A (Asp-123 in MAO B) located at the entrance of the U-shaped substrate-binding site of PAO has no effect on MAO A and MAO B catalytic activity when mutated to alanine. The high similarity observed between the MAO A and MAO B mutants suggests that these amino acids have the same function in both isoenzymes and that the substrate-binding site of MAO A and B may be similar. The sequence identity between PAO and the two forms of MAO is about 20%, thus no automatic homology procedure can be applied. In order to construct three-dimensional models for both MAO A and MAO B, we adopted a modeling procedure that was used with success in the past to model other proteins sharing low homology with template structures (33.de Fays K. Tibor A. Lambert C. Vinals C. Denoël P. De Bolle X. Wouters J. Letesson J.J. Depiereux E. Protein Eng. 1998; 12: 217-223Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 34.Roh J.H. Wouters J. Depiereux E. Yakawa H. Inui M. Minami H. Suzuki H. Kumagai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This procedure involves careful multiple sequence alignments, secondary structure predictions, assignment of coordinates of the template (PAO) to the target (MAO A and B), modeling of loops, energy minimization, and theoretical evaluation of the geometry. Sequence alignment is a key step in any homology modeling procedure. It becomes essential when working with proteins sharing low sequence identity. Therefore, extensive multiple sequence alignments have been performed on MAOs and other flavoproteins. They led to an alignment between the MAO A, MAO B, and PAO sequences (Fig. 1). This alignment, similar to the one presented in the literature (25.Binda C. Coda A. Angelini R. Federico R. Ascenzi P. Mattevi A. Struct. Fold Design. 1999; 7: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (164) Google Scholar), was retained as input for comparative modeling of MAO A and MAO B. The C-terminal part of the MAO sequences is predicted as a hydrophobic helix that could be associated to the membrane. This prediction is consistent with experimental data of the literature (35.Mitoma J.-Y. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 36.Chen K. Wu H.-F.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29499-29506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, no three-dimensional model has been assigned to the last 30 amino acids of the MAO sequences. Secondary structure assignment has also been proposed for both MAO A and B, using a consensus between several algorithms (40.Wouters J. Baudoux G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 32: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and were taken as a guide in the modeling process. Predicted secondary structure elements on MAO are in good agreement with the observed structure of PAO (Fig. 1). After coordinates of structurally conserved regions of PAO were assigned to the sequences of MAO A and B, loop regions have been modeled (homology program). Prior to energy minimization of the resulting models, a covalent bond was imposed between the flavin cofactor (methyl carbon C8α) and the sulfur atom of Cys-406 in MAO A or Cys-397 in MAO B, in accordance with evidence from the literature (10.Kearney E.B. Salach J.I. Walker W.H. Seng R.L. Kenny W. Zeszotek E. Singer T.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 24: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 11.Yu P.H. Can. J.

Chem. 1998; 5: 137-162PubMed Google Scholar). This could easily be done as this cysteine residue (corresponding to Thr-402 in PAO) is very close to the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin. Models for the MAO A Y407F, Y407S, Y444F, and Y444S and MAO B Y398F, Y398S, Y435F, and Y435S mutants were also built and energy-minimized. The geometry of the final models complies with statistical criteria. In particular, about 95% of the residues in the MAO A and MAO B models are in allowed regions (77 and 18% of φ/ψ angles lie, respectively, in the most favored or additional allowed regions) of the Ramachandran plot, and all bond lengths and valence angles correspond to expected values. Final models are available upon request to the authors. PAO shares a 20% amino acid identity with MAO, and we have compared amino acids that are conserved between PAO and all the cloned MAOs as follows: human, rat, mouse, and bovine MAO A; human, rat, and mouse MAO B; and trout MAO. According to the PAO structure, there are 15 amino acids associated with FAD binding (Table IV) and 16 other amino acids associated with the substrate-binding pocket (Table V).Table IVCommon FAD binding amino acids in MAO and PAO Open table in a new tab Table VCommon substrate binding amino acids in MAO and PAO Open table in a new tab Of the 15 amino acids associated with FAD in PAO (Fig. 2), 6 (Asn-59, Trp-60, Tyr-399, Thr-402, Glu-430, and Val-440) are non-conserved with MAOs, and 5 (Ser-15, Glu-35, Ala-36, Arg-43, and Gly-57 in PAO) are conserved with MAOs but are within the general FAD signature motif of flavoproteins near the N terminus. Val-237 and Tyr-439 of PAO are conserved with all MAOs but exert their function via their main chain atoms (25.Binda C. Coda A. Angelini R. Federico R. Ascenzi P. Mattevi A. Struct. Fold Design. 1999; 7: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Thus, there are only two amino acids in PAO that are conserved among all MAOs and bind to FAD through their side chains. In PAO, Lys-300 makes an indirect bond with N-5 of the isoalloxazine moiety of FAD via a water molecule and Trp-393 binds the dimethylbenzene portion of FAD (Fig. 2). Mutating the corresponding amino acid of Lys-300 in PAO to alanine in MAO A and B to produce A-K305A and B-K296A, respectively, results in the complete inactivation of the enzymes. Therefore, this conserved lysine is necessary for enzyme activity and may therefore have the same interaction with the FAD of MAO A and B as it does in PAO. Mutating the equivalents of Trp-393 in PAO to alanine in MAO A and B also produces inactive enzymes. Trp-393 in PAO has extensive Van der Waals interactions with the dimethylbenzene portion of FAD, and its equivalent in MAO A and B may have the same function. Taken together, these results suggest that Lys-305 and Trp-397 in MAO A and their corresponding residues in MAO B, Lys-296 and Trp-388, are essential for the activity of the enzyme. They may play an important role in the non-covalent binding or in the incorporation of FAD that is disrupted when they are mutated to alanine. FAD attachment to MAO has been shown to be disrupted when the amino acids for covalent attachment, Cys-406 in MAO A and Cys-397 in MAO B, are mutated to serine (12.Wu H.F. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 888-893PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that FAD does not get incorporated when noncovalently binding amino acids are mutated (23.Zhou B.P. Wu B. Kwan S.W. Abell C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14862-14868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 41.Kirskey T.J. Kwan S.-W. Abell C.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12360-12366Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This implies that FAD incorporation to MAO requires both covalent and non-covalent interactions with the enzyme. Of the 16 amino acids associated with the PAO substrate-binding pocket, only 5 (Glu-120, Phe-171, Phe-403, Gly-438, and Tyr-439) are conserved with MAO A and B from different species (Fig. 3). Glu-120 is located at the entrance of the substrate-binding site of PAO, which is a U-shaped tunnel but does not appear to have an interaction with either the FAD or the substrate (Fig. 3). The corresponding amino acids are Asp-132 in MAO A and Asp-123 in MAO B. Mutating them to alanine had a negligible effect on enzyme activity indicating that this residue is not essential for enzyme function. Phe-403 and Tyr-439 are the only two amino acids in the substrate-binding site of PAO that are conserved with MAO. In PAO they form an “aromatic sandwich” that consists of these two residues flanking the opposite sides of the substrate-binding site in a parallel fashion. Furthermore, the hydroxyl group of Tyr-439 interacts directly with the inhibitor (Fig. 3). When their corresponding residues in MAO A, Tyr-407 and Tyr-444, and MAO B, Tyr-398 and Tyr-435, are mutated to serine, the enzyme loses all activity; however, when they are mutated to phenylalanine the enzyme remains active. This indicates that indeed it is the aromatic portion and not the hydroxyl portion that is essential for activity and suggests a similar aromatic sandwich structure in MAO. Interestingly, A-Y444F and B-Y435F have very low activity compared with the wild type, whereas the A-Y407F and B-Y398F mutants had similar activity to the wild type. This indicates that the hydroxyl groups of Tyr-444 and Tyr-435 are more important than those of Tyr-407 and Tyr-398 for substrate binding. This is in agreement with the structure of the substrate-binding site of PAO in which the hydroxyl group of Tyr-439, the PAO equivalent of Tyr-444 and Tyr-435 in MAO A and B, interacts directly with the bound inhibitor (25.Binda C. Coda A. Angelini R. Federico R. Ascenzi P. Mattevi A. Struct. Fold Design. 1999; 7: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The mutants A-D132A and B-D123A resulted in only a slight decrease in substrate affinity. Therefore, Asp-132 and Asp-123 in MAO A and B are not important for enzyme activity. Taken together, these results show that with the exception of two mutants (A-D132A and B-D123A), amino acids conserved between PAO and MAO and whose function is mediated by the amino acid side chain result in inactive MAOs when mutated to non-conserved residues. This suggests that MAO and PAO have the same overall structure and at least one common feature within the substrate-binding site. It is also noteworthy that all the mutations produced a very similar effect in MAO A and MAO B. This suggests that FAD binding and the substrate-binding site between the two MAO isoenzymes are highly similar. The structure of the recently crystallized PAO was used as a template to build a three-dimensional structure of both types of MAO (Fig. 4). The modeling procedure includes multiple sequence alignment, secondary structure prediction, energy minimization, and final geometry evaluation. The three-dimensional structure of MAO A and B consists of three domains as follows: 1) a FAD (non-covalent) binding domain, 2) a substrate-binding domain, and 3) a helical (interface) domain. The main structural elements of the FAD (non-covalent) binding domain (Fig. 4) are a central parallel β-sheet flanked by a β-meander and three α-helices. This arrangement orresponds to the classical folding topology observed in several dinucleotide-binding enzymes. The sequence and structure similarity between MAO and PAO is particularly evident in this domain. The validity of the MAO modeling is supported by the site-directed mutagenesis studies (Lys-305, Tyr-397, Tyr-407, Tyr-444, and Asp-132 in MAO A, see Fig. 4). It is also supported by our previous studies (12.Wu H.F. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 888-893PubMed Google Scholar) in which we have shown that Cys-406 is covalently attached to FAD; and Ile-335 (24.Geha R.M. Rebrin I. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9877-9882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and Phe 208 (22.Geha R.M. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1304-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) are important for the substrate and inhibitor specificities in human and rat MAO, respectively. In spite of the low sequence similarity, the topology of MAO, modeled from PAO, also closely resembles that of l-amino acid oxidase (42.Pawelek P.D. Cheah J. Coulombe R. Macheroux P. Ghisla S. Vrielink A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4204-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) with further similarities to d-amino acid oxidase (43.Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (44.Schreuder H.A. Van der Laan J.M.

Within this family of flavoproteins, most structural differences appear in the helical (interface) domain (42.Pawelek P.D. Cheah J. Coulombe R. Macheroux P. Ghisla S. Vrielink A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4204-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The FAD cofactor, non-covalently bound in PAO, is placed in such a way that it can easily form a covalent link to Cys-406 of MAO A and Cys-397 of MAO B (Fig. 5). Models for the MAO A Y407F, Y407S, Y444F, and Y444S and MAO B Y398F, Y398S, Y435F, and Y435S mutants were also built, and the interaction energies between the FAD cofactor and the enzymes have been computed (Table VI). Although these results must be considered with caution, they underline the important destabilizing effect introduced by substituting a Tyr residue by a Ser. Keeping an aromatic residue in position 407 or 444 in MAO A (398 or 435 in MAO B) by replacing the Tyr residue by a Phe only slightly affects the binding of the cofactor. Docking experiments are now planned in order to transpose those results to substrate and inhibitor complexes.Table VISimulated interaction energies between the FAD cofactor and MAO A and B wild type and mutantsEnzymeInteraction energykcal/molMAO A wild type−9.12MAO A-Y407F−7.81MAO A-Y407S−1.43MAO A-Y444F−8.95MAO A-Y444S−5.78MAO B wild type−9.18MAO B-Y398F−8.05MAO B-Y398S−1.43MAO B-Y435F−9.28MAO B-Y435S−6.46 Open table in a new tab We thank Eric Depiereux for assisting in molecular modeling of MAOs."
https://openalex.org/W2009320117,"Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is an antioxidant enzyme that attenuates brain and lung injury from oxidative stress. A polybasic region in the carboxyl terminus distinguishes EC-SOD from other superoxide dismutases and determines EC-SOD's tissue half-life and affinity for heparin. There are two types of EC-SOD that differ based on the presence or absence of this heparin-binding region. It has recently been shown that proteolytic removal of the heparin-binding region is an intracellular event (Enghild, J. J., Thogersen, I. B., Oury, T. D., Valnickova, Z., Hojrup, P., and Crapo, J. D. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 14818-14822). By using mammalian cell lines, we have now determined that removal of the heparin-binding region occurs after passage through the Golgi network but before being secreted into the extracellular space. Specific protease inhibitors and overexpression of intracellular proteases implicate furin as a processing protease. In vitro experiments using furin and purified EC-SOD suggest that furin proteolytically cleaves EC-SOD in the middle of the polybasic region and then requires an additional carboxypeptidase to remove the remaining lysines and arginines. A mutation in Arg(213) renders EC-SOD resistant to furin processing. These results indicate that furin-dependent processing of EC-SOD is important for determining the tissue distribution and half-life of EC-SOD."

Conversely, Wnt signaling blocks GSK-3s activity toward non-primed substrates without affecting its activity toward primed substrates. In the absence of a Wnt signal, GSK-3 is part of a multiprotein complex that includes the proteins Axin, APC, and β-catenin (14Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl.

These proteins help GSK-3 to efficiently phosphorylate the signaling molecule β-catenin, thus targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation (26Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J.

Axin acts as a scaffolding protein in this complex, binding both GSK-3 and β-catenin in a manner that brings them into close proximity, thus allowing GSK-3 to phosphorylate β-catenin (15Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A.

Another GSK-3 interacting molecule, GBP (GSK-3binding protein), and its mammalian homologue FRAT, binds to GSK-3 and inhibits its phosphorylation of non-primed GSK-3 substrates, including β-catenin (29Yost C. Farr III, G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 30Thomas G.M. Frame S. Goedert M. Nathke I. Polakis P. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that GSK-3 regulation occurs in part through a competition between its activating partner (Axin) and its inhibiting partner (GBP/FRAT) (30Thomas G.M. Frame S. Goedert M. Nathke I. Polakis P. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 31Farr III, G.H. Ferkey D.M. Yost C. Pierce S.B. Weaver C. Kimelman D. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30419-30423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We wished to better understand the nature of this competition and hypothesized that GBP and Axin might compete for GSK-3 binding by sharing overlapping binding sites on GSK-3. To identify the residues of GSK-3 important for binding to each, and to develop useful reagents for analyzing the roles of GSK-3 in vivo, we preformed a reverse two-hybrid screen in yeast. We have identified mutations that show large alterations in binding to Axin or GBP, and we show that a cluster of mutations that diminishes GSK-3 binding to Axin overlaps a cluster of mutations that alters binding to GBP. We therefore propose that GBP/FRAT and Axin can compete for binding to GSK-3 to differentially regulate its activity because they share overlapping binding sites on GSK-3. We have used our GSK-3 mutants to examine the previously reported role of GSK-3 in eye development (33Itoh K. Tang T. Neel B. Sokol S.Y. Development. 1995; 121: 3979-3988PubMed Google Scholar) and show that the ability of GSK-3 to suppress eye development is not dependent upon its interactions with Axin or GBP. Furthermore, we show that a mutation in GSK-3 that selectively inhibits its ability to phosphorylate primed substrates has no effect on eye development. These findings suggest that GSK-3 alters eye development by targeting a primed substrate and not by affecting the β-catenin pathway. We followed the general procedure of Inouye et al. (34Inouye C. Dhillon N. Durfee T. Zambryski P.C. Thorner J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 479-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complete Xenopus GSK-3 (Xgsk-3) coding region was inserted into the f1-VP16 vector (35Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) to produce XGVP16, which puts a VP16 transcriptional activating domain on Xgsk-3. The GSK-3-binding region of mouse Axin was inserted into MA424 (36Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 113-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) to produce Axin-Gal4, which puts a Gal4 DNA-binding region on Axin. The complete GBP coding region was inserted into BTM116 (37Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar) to produce BP-lexA, which puts a lexA DNA-binding region on GBP. Xgsk-3 was mutagenized by PCR amplification following a published procedure (38Zhou Y.H. Zhang X.P. Ebright R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) using one primer in the LEU2 gene and one primer after the transcriptional stop sequence. The amplified product was combined with an AflII-BamHI fragment of XGVP16, which lacks the GSK-3 coding region and part of theLEU2 gene. This was transfected into strain YCJ4, which has Gal4-binding sites in front of URA3 and LexA-binding sites in front of LacZ(39Tu H. Barr M. Dong D.L. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5876-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Approximately 12,000 transfectants were plated and colonies were selected that were either URA+ or, using 5-fluoroorotic acid, that were URA−. These colonies were then screened using a filter assay for β-galactosidase activity, to find white, URA+ colonies and blue, URA− colonies. The mutant XGVP16 plasmids were isolated from these colonies and retransfected into YCJ4 and retested for growth on URA and β-galactosidase activity. To create an amino-terminal Myc epitope-tagged Xenopus GSK-3 (XG220), the coding region of wild-type Xgsk-3 was inserted into the Bgl2 site of CS3MT (D. Turner, University of Michigan). For analysis inXenopus embryos, each of the GSK-3 mutants was inserted into CS3MT. The GSK-3 single mutants Xgsk-CS8-N, Xgsk-CS8-C, Xgsk-CS116-N, Xgsk-CS116-C, and Xgsk-R96A were created in XG220 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. GBP-HA (GBPCS2+HA) (31Farr III, G.H. Ferkey D.M. Yost C. Pierce S.B. Weaver C. Kimelman D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and Xaxin-HA (Xaxin/CS2HA) (20Hedgepeth C.M. Deardorff M.A. Rankin K. Klein P.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7147-7157Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) were described previously. Embryos were obtained as previously described (40Newport J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1982; 30: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar) and were microinjected (41Moon R.T. Christian J.L. Technique. 1989; 1: 76-89Google Scholar) with RNA synthesized from CS2+-derived constructs (42Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) linearized withNotI using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's directions. For eye development experiments, each of the two dorsal blastomeres of 4-cell stage embryos were injected at the marginal zone with 2 ng of RNA encoding wild-type or mutant GSK-3s. Embryos were allowed to develop to tadpole stages before scoring eye development. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 1–2 ng of each RNA, alone or in combination, was injected into the animal pole of 4-cell stage embryos in a single 10-nl injection. Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were performed as previously described (29Yost C. Farr III, G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Anti-Myc and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Covance. Injections and immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described (29Yost C. Farr III, G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The CREB peptide kinase assay was performed as previously described (31Farr III, G.H. Ferkey D.M. Yost C. Pierce S.B. Weaver C. Kimelman D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and 32P incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation. All values were normalized to the amount of GSK-3 protein expressed in each sample, as determined by Western blot, and then scaled to set wild-type GSK-3 activity at 100% in each trial. Activity in uninjected samples was always less than 0.5%. Assays were performed in duplicate. Tau phosphorylation assays were performed in the same manner, using 10 μm Tau protein, purchased from Calbiochem. Reactions were stopped after 20 min by the addition of SDS sample buffer, boiled, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Tau phosphorylation was quantitated using the Storm Imaging system (Molecular Dynamics). Levels of Tau phosphorylation were normalized to the amount of GSK-3 protein expressed in each sample. Wild-type GSK-3 activity was set at 100% in each trial. To identify the GBP and Axin-binding sites on GSK-3 we performed a yeast “reverse two-hybrid” screen, as shown in Fig. 1, that allowed us to select GSK-3 mutants that bound either GBP or Axin, but not both. The advantage of this type of screen is that it allowed us to avoid GSK-3 mutants that were simply unstable or misfolded, since one positive binding selection was always present. From this screen, eight mutants that lack GBP binding (Fig.2A) and seven mutants that lack Axin binding (Fig. 2B), as indicated by the yeast assay, were chosen for further analysis.Figure 2Diagram of GSK-3 mutants. GSK-3 mutants that did not bind GBP (A) or Axin (B), in the yeast reverse two-hybrid screen are shown. Each mutant contains at least one mutation in a region in the carboxyl terminus, indicated by the shaded boxes labeled GBP and Axin. mRNA for each mutant was also injected into Xenopus to test its binding to GBP and Axin by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Levels of binding in Xenopus are shown on theright (nt, not tested). The mutants shown in thetop part of each panel are those isolated from the yeast screen. The mutants in the bottom part of each panel were constructed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DNA sequence analysis revealed that while many of the GSK-3 mutants contain more than one amino acid change, each contains at least one mutation that clusters in a region in the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2). Strikingly, the cluster of residues that appear to be important for GBP binding overlaps the region containing the cluster of residues important for Axin binding, suggesting that GBP and Axin share overlapping binding sites on GSK-3. The binding domains defined by the mutational clusters also overlap in the carboxyl-terminal lobe when mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of GSK-3 (Fig.3, A–C). Each of the GSK-3 mutants was also tested for its ability to bind Axin and GBP when injected into Xenopus embryos. mRNA encoding Myc-tagged wild-type or one of the mutant GSK-3s was co-injected into Xenopus embryos with mRNA encoding Xaxin-HA and GBP-HA. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies and analyzed by Western blot using anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies. The binding results are summarized in Fig. 2. In this assay some of the “non-Axin binding” mutants identified in yeast bound to Axin (Fig. 2B), perhaps because only the GSK-3-binding region of Axin was used in the two-hybrid screen, whereas full-length Axin was tested in the Xenopus co-immunoprecipitation assay. Full-length Axin may provide additional contacts that help to stabilize its interaction with GSK-3. Surprisingly, some of the mutants that bind Axin, but not GBP, in yeast do not interact with either inXenopus, suggesting a different stringency of binding between the yeast and Xenopus assays (Fig. 2). In the yeast assay, a GSK-3 mutant that has decreased binding to Axin or GBP can presumably still activate expression of the reporter gene, although the interaction is not strong enough in Xenopus embryos to be seen by co-immunoprecipitation. We also noticed that GBP levels were sometimes lower in the presence of GSK-3 mutants that cannot bind GBP, suggesting that GBP may be stabilized by binding to GSK-3 (data not shown). From this analysis we identified three interesting mutants that showed strong differential binding effects in both yeast andXenopus. These results are summarized in Fig. 2 and theXenopus binding data is shown in Fig.4. As predicted from the yeast assay, Xgsk-CS116 does not bind GBP but binds Axin at wild-type levels, and Xgsk-CS8 binds GBP but not Axin. While Xgsk-CS22 has lost most Axin binding, it has acquired the novel feature of being a GBP “super-binder.” The single point mutation in Xgsk-CS22 and the carboxyl-terminal mutations in Xgsk-CS116 and Xgsk-CS8 are in very close proximity on the GSK-3 structure (Fig. 3, D–F). Since only one of the two changes in Xgsk-CS116 and Xgsk-CS42, a GBP super-binder that does not bind Axin, lies in the carboxyl-terminal mutation cluster (Fig. 2), we wished to determine whether either mutation alone was sufficient to affect GBP or Axin binding. While the amino-terminal mutation in Xgsk-CS116 (Xgsk-CS116-N) did not disrupt binding to GBP-HA, the carboxyl-terminal mutation, which changes residue 285 from asparagine to aspartate (Xgsk-CS116-C), was sufficient to disrupt binding (Fig. 2A). In the case of Xgsk-CS42, however, neither single mutation was sufficient to disrupt binding to Xaxin-HA or to enhance binding to GBP-HA (Fig.2B). To determine whether the GSK-3 mutations affected GSK-3 catalytic activity as well as binding to GBP and Axin, mutants Xgsk-CS116, Xgsk-CS8, and Xgsk-CS22 were compared with wild-type GSK-3 for their ability to phosphorylate two different substrates. GSK-3s activity toward primed substrates (pre-phosphorylated at the +4 position) is not regulated by Wnt signaling components (1Ding V.W. Chen R.H. McCormick F. J. Biol.

We therefore compared the ability of Xgsk-CS116, Xgsk-CS8, Xgsk-CS22, and wild-type GSK-3 to phosphorylate P-CREB, a primed peptide substrate. While the ability of Xgsk-CS8 and Xgsk-22 to phosphorylate P-CREB was near wild-type, Xgsk-CS116 consistently had somewhat lower activity (Fig.5A). Statistical analysis using the Student’s t test revealed that only Xgsk-CS116 had a statistically significant decrease in catalytic activity toward P-CREB (p ≤ 0.05). Tau protein is a GSK-3 substrate that does not require pre-phosphorylation. GBP and the GSK-3-binding region of FRAT (FRATtide) can inhibit GSK-3 phosphorylation of Tau (29Yost C. Farr III, G.H.

Wild-type GSK-3, Xgsk-CS8, and Xgsk-CS22 all efficiently phosphorylate Tau protein (Fig. 5B). As was observed in the P-CREB assay, the activity of Xgsk-CS116 on Tau is also reduced, although quite variable. In three out of four experiments, the activity was less than 40% of wild type. Statistical analysis revealed that only Xgsk-CS116 had a statistically significant decrease in activity toward Tau (p ≤ 0.05). Together, these results demonstrate that the mutants Xgsk-CS8 and Xgsk-CS22 retain relatively normal levels of GSK-3 catalytic activity on both primed and non-primed substrates, while Xgsk-CS116 has a reduction in overall activity compared with wild-type GSK-3. Ectopic dorsal expression of GSK-3 causes the reduction or loss of eye structures in Xenopus embryos (33Itoh K. Tang T. Neel B. Sokol S.Y. Development. 1995; 121: 3979-3988PubMed Google Scholar). This loss is similar to that seen by dorsal overexpression of a dominant-negative Xenopus Frizzled-3, whereas ectopic Frizzled-3 induces the development of ectopic eyes (44Rasmussen J.T. Deardorff M.A. Tan C. Rao M.S. Klein P.S. Vetter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3861-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, zebrafish homozygous for a mutation in axin develop with reduced or missing eyes (45van de Water S. van de Wetering M. Joore J. Esseling J. Bink R. Clevers H. Zivkovic D. Development. 2001; 128: 3877-3888PubMed Google Scholar, 46Heisenberg C.P. Houart C. Take-Uchi M. Rauch G.J. Young N. Coutinho P. Masai I. Caneparo L. Concha M.L. Geisler R. Dale T.C. Wilson S.W. Stemple D.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1427-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These results suggested a role for Wnt signaling in eye development. The mutations described here allowed us to test whether the effects of GSK-3 overexpression were due to alterations in the Wnt pathway. If this were the case, we would expect that mutations in GSK-3 that lack either Axin or GBP binding would show an altered effect on eye development. We therefore injected mRNA encoding the GSK-3 mutants intoXenopus embryos to analyze their effect in vivo. As previously described (33Itoh K. Tang T. Neel B. Sokol S.Y. Development. 1995; 121: 3979-3988PubMed Google Scholar), dorsal expression of GSK-3 resulted in a high percentage of embryos with missing or reduced eyes (Fig.6, A and C–F). While the effects of Xgsk-CS8 and Xgsk-CS22 were similar to wild-type GSK-3, the effects of Xgsk-CS116 were not as strong (Fig.6A). Our results suggested that the effects of GSK-3 on eye development were not due to effects on the Wnt pathway since all of the mutants tested perturbed eye development. However, while the somewhat reduced effects of Xgsk-CS116 could be explained by its reduced kinase activity instead of its inability to bind GBP (Fig. 5), we wanted more direct evidence that the effects of GSK-3 were on a non-Wnt pathway. Mutation of residue 96 from arginine to alanine was previously reported to selectively inhibit human GSK-3 phosphorylation of primed substrates, but not non-primed substrates such as β-catenin (12Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). We made the same mutation in Xenopus GSK-3 (Xgsk-R96A) and found that it did not efficiently phosphorylate primed substrates (data not shown) as previously shown for human GSK-3 (12Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). As was shown for other non-primed substrates with this mutation in human GSK-3 (12Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), Xgsk-R96A phosphorylated Tau protein more efficiently than wild-type GSK-3, and we found that it efficiently bound both GBP and Axin (data not shown). When injected dorsally, Xgsk-R96A had almost no effect on eye development (Fig. 6B). Since this GSK-3 mutant is unable to phosphorylate primed substrates and has lost the ability to block eye development, combined with the data from our other GSK-3 mutants, our results suggest that the ability of GSK-3 to affect eye formation involves regulation of a non-Wnt pathway. An important mode of GSK-3 regulation occurs through its interactions with multiple binding partners. GBP/FRAT can compete with Axin for binding to GSK-3, resulting in GSK-3 inhibition (29Yost C. Farr III, G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 30Thomas G.M. Frame S. Goedert M. Nathke I. Polakis P. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 32Yuan H. Li J. Mao L. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30419-30423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It has not been clear how the competition between GBP/FRAT and Axin occurs. We have identified mutations in GSK-3 that suggest GBP and Axin share overlapping binding sites on the carboxyl-terminal lobe of GSK-3 (Figs. 2 and 3). However, it is likely that multiple residues are involved in the association of GSK-3 with each, as we identified several different residues that affect GBP and Axin binding. Most of the GSK-3 mutants identified in our screen also contain at least one additional mutation amino-terminal to the overlapping mutational clusters. While neither of the Xgsk-CS42 mutations was sufficient to disrupt binding to Axin when tested alone, the single change in Xgsk-CS22 prevented Axin binding, suggesting that different residues contribute differently to Axin binding. Interestingly, the single change in Xgsk-CS22 not only abolished the GSK-3-Axin interaction, but it greatly enhanced the ability of GSK-3 to bind GBP. Since a single amino acid change differentially affects GSK-3s interactions with both GBP and Axin, it strongly suggests that the two binding sites on GSK-3 are intimately associated. In addition, it demonstrates that the binding of GBP to GSK-3 has not evolved to be maximally strong, most likely to allow highly dynamic interactions between GSK-3 and its binding partners. While this article was in preparation, Fraser et al. (47Fraser, E., Young, N., Dajani, R., Franca-Koh, J., Ryves, J., Williams, R. S., Yeo, M., Webster, M. T., Richardson, C., Smalley, M. J., Pearl, L. H., Harwood, A., and Dale, T. C. (2001)J. Biol. ChemGoogle Scholar) reported that FRATtide and the GSK-3-binding region of Axin (Axin-GID) can both disrupt GSK-3 dimers, supporting the hypothesis that GBP/FRAT and Axin share overlapping binding sites on GSK-3. Additionally, using surface scanning mutagenesis of GSK-3, they identify five mutants that have differential effects on Axin-GID and FRATtide binding. These results nicely complement ours, although there are some interesting differences. While Fraser et al. (47Fraser, E., Young, N., Dajani, R., Franca-Koh, J., Ryves, J., Williams, R. S., Yeo, M., Webster, M. T., Richardson, C., Smalley, M. J., Pearl, L. H., Harwood, A., and Dale, T. C. (2001)J. Biol. ChemGoogle Scholar) found four mutants that do not bind Axin-GID, all of them also have reduced FRATtide binding (20–80% of wild-type binding). Perhaps this is due to the fact that Fraser et al. (47Fraser, E., Young, N., Dajani, R., Franca-Koh, J., Ryves, J., Williams, R. S., Yeo, M., Webster, M. T., Richardson, C., Smalley, M. J., Pearl, L. H., Harwood, A., and Dale, T. C. (2001)J. Biol. ChemGoogle Scholar) did not use full-length proteins as were used here. The Axin-GID corresponds to 59 amino acids of Axin, whereas FRATtide corresponds to only 38 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal half of FRAT. They also identified one mutant that reduced FRATtide binding 3-fold, but did not find a GSK-3 mutant that selectively eliminated FRATtide binding. Additionally, whereas we found that a single mutation at residue 285 (N285D) is sufficient to eliminate binding to GBP without affecting Axin binding, Fraseret al. (47Fraser, E., Young, N., Dajani, R., Franca-Koh, J., Ryves, J., Williams, R. S., Yeo, M., Webster, M. T., Richardson, C., Smalley, M. J., Pearl, L. H., Harwood, A., and Dale, T. C. (2001)J. Biol. ChemGoogle Scholar) found that a similar change (N285E) reduced, but did not eliminate, binding to both FRATtide and Axin-GID. The different results could be due to species differences (human versus Xenopus GSK-3), or because the bulkier side chain of glutamic acid in the Fraser et al. (47Fraser, E., Young, N., Dajani, R., Franca-Koh, J., Ryves, J., Williams, R. S., Yeo, M., Webster, M. T., Richardson, C., Smalley, M. J., Pearl, L. H., Harwood, A., and Dale, T. C. (2001)J. Biol. ChemGoogle Scholar) mutant allows it to affect binding to both FRATtide and Axin-GID, whereas the aspartate in our mutant interferes only with GBP binding. Fraser et al. (47Fraser, E., Young, N., Dajani, R., Franca-Koh, J., Ryves, J., Williams, R. S., Yeo, M., Webster, M. T., Richardson, C., Smalley, M. J., Pearl, L. H., Harwood, A., and Dale, T. C. (2001)J. Biol. ChemGoogle Scholar) report a mutant that does not bind Axin-GID (V267G/E268R), but still binds FRATtide (80% of wild-type). While our screen did not identify these residues, they clearly lie within our proposed Axin-binding domain, and are near to residue 261, which we find to be important for Axin binding (in combination with residue 167 in Xgsk-CS42). We also found a unique single mutation (F291L in Xgsk-CS22) that not only eliminates binding to Axin, but also greatly enhances GBP binding, thus affecting both interactions in an opposite manner. This residue lies between two mutations that Fraseret al. (47Fraser, E., Young, N., Dajani, R., Franca-Koh, J., Ryves, J., Williams, R. S., Yeo, M., Webster, M. T., Richardson, C., Smalley, M. J., Pearl, L. H., Harwood, A., and Dale, T. C. (2001)J. Biol. ChemGoogle Scholar) identify as decreasing binding to both Axin-GID and FRATtide (Y288R and F293Q). Bax et al. (48Bax B. Carter P.S. Lewis C. Guy A.R. Bridges A. Tanner R. Pettman G. Mannix C. Culbert A.A. Brown M.J. Smith D.G. Reith A.D. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have also just reported the structure of GSK-3 bound to FRATtide (residues 188–226 of FRAT1). Consistent with our mutagenesis studies using GSK-3 and GBP, they show that FRATtide binds to the carboxyl-terminal lobe of GSK-3. Significantly, they show that the side chains of Tyr288 and Glu290 of GSK-3 make important contacts with Lys214 of FRATtide. We previously identified the same lysine in GBP as being necessary for GBP/GSK-3 binding (29Yost C. Farr III, G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Both of our GSK-3 mutants that affect GBP binding contain changes very near to these important residues: N285D in Xgsk-CS116C and F291L in Xgsk-CS22. It is likely that our changes affect the conformation at nearby residues (288/290) that are required for interaction with GBP/FRATtide. Interestingly, Bax et al.(48Bax B. Carter P.S. Lewis C. Guy A.R. Bridges A. Tanner R. Pettman G. Mannix C. Culbert A.A. Brown M.J. Smith D.G. Reith A.D. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) also show that Ser261 makes contacts with FRATtide, while we find that a mutation at this residue, in combination with Arg167 in Xgsk-CS42, eliminates Axin binding and enhances GBP binding. The reverse two-hybrid screen described here provides a good compliment to the structure based mutations of Fraser et al. (47Fraser, E., Young, N., Dajani, R., Franca-Koh, J., Ryves, J., Williams, R. S., Yeo, M., Webster, M. T., Richardson, C., Smalley, M. J., Pearl, L. H., Harwood, A., and Dale, T. C. (2001)J. Biol. ChemGoogle Scholar), identifying a mutation that blocks GBP binding, which was not found from the structure based approach, and identifying a unique mutation (F291L) that has opposite effects on GBP and Axin binding. Due to the importance of GSK-3 in many biological processes, it will be valuable to assemble a collection of different GSK-3 mutants for in vivo analysis. We utilized the observation that dorsal overexpression of GSK-3 causes alterations in eye development as the first in vivo test of the GSK-3 mutants. Because of the early role for GSK-3 in patterning the dorsal-ventral axis inXenopus embryos (49Pierce S.B. Kimelman D. Development. 1995; 121: 755-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50He X.

A. 1995; 92: 8498-8502Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), dorsal overexpression of wild-type GSK-3 might have been expected to produce ventralized embryos. However, this was not observed. While overexpression of Axin can cause effects on the dorsal-ventral axis, GSK-3, unlike Axin, does not appear to be present in limiting amounts (52Salic A. Lee E. Mayer L. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 523-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The mutant GSK-3s also did not affect the dorsal-ventral axis, likely because the injections cannot be done early enough to disrupt the endogenous Axin·GSK-3 protein complexes and thus affect the embryonic axis. All three mutants tested altered eye development, as did wild-type GSK-3. The non-GBP binding mutant, Xgsk-CS116, was less effective than wild-type GSK-3, which might be due to its decreased catalytic activity. To test the hypothesis that the effects of GSK-3 were not on the Wnt pathway, but were due to its effects on primed substrates, we created the mutant Xgsk-R96A, which is defective only in phosphorylating primed substrates. Xgsk-R96A, like human GSK-3(R96A) (12Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), phosphorylates primed substrates at only 20% of wild-type levels. As shown previously for human GSK-3(R96A) phosphorylation of Axin and β-catenin (12Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), we found that Xgsk-R96A phosphorylates the non-primed substrate Tau more efficiently than wild-type GSK-3. Moreover, Xgsk-R96A retained binding to both Axin and GBP, but did not have a major effect on eye development. Together with our analysis of the GSK-3 mutants that do not bind Axin or GBP, our results indicate that the effects of GSK-3 on the eyes occurs through a non-Wnt pathway. Given the large repertoire of transcription factors now implicated in eye development (53Chow R.L. Lang R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 255-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 54Ogino H. Yasuda K. Dev. Growth Differ. 2000; 42: 437-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it will be very interesting to determine whether any might be direct targets for GSK-3 phosphorylation and regulation.

Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5661) Google Scholar). Recent studies have described NO as effecting a variety of other cellular functions through direct posttranslational modifications of proteins directly (i.e. nitrosylation and nitration), reacting with reactive oxygen species, and interacting with proteins that contain a heme moiety (4Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase is one particular heme protein with which NO interacts, resulting in the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the oxidase (5Brown G.C. Cooper C.E.

Under normal physiologic conditions, cytochrome c oxidase is the final electron acceptor of the respiratory chain, resulting in the reduction of oxygen to water. NO acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to oxygen, and NO inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase has been shown to regulate cellular respiration and apoptosis under normal oxygen conditions (7Clementi E.

Wild-type HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells were incubated in Dulbecco’s modified essential medium containing ethidium bromide (100 ng/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and uridine (100 μg/ml) to generateAé°-HT1080 cells (31King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 304-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ρ° status of cells was confirmed by the absence of cytochrome oxidase subunit II by polymerase chain reaction and by the failure to grow in the absence of uridine in the medium. Hypoxic conditions (1.5% O2, 93.5% N2, and 5% CO2) were achieved in a humidified variable aerobic work station (INVIVO O2, Ruskinn Technologies) at 37 °C. Nitric oxide was added to cells using the NO donor (z)-1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2 diolate (DETA-NO, Alexis Corp.). Cell death was assayed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase activity (LDH) in culture supernatants using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Apoptosis was detected as a percentage of cells, which had condensed, or by fragmented nuclei with Hoechst 33258 staining (1 μg/ml, Sigma) as described previously (32Byun Y. Chen F. Chang R. Trivedi M. Green K.J. Cryns V.L. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Rat1a fibroblasts were plated on 60-mm culture dishes at 20–30% confluence and exposed to experimental conditions. Both adherent and non-adherent cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and placed on a glass slide at 14,000 × g for 5 min (Cytospin®3 Cytocentrifuge, Thermo Shandon). The cells were fixed with 40% methanol (5 min, −20 °C), blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and incubated for 2 h with 1 μg/ml of anti-cytochromec monoclonal antibody (BD PharMingen) at 37 °C in a humidified environment. The cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, air-dried, and incubated for 1 h with 1 μg of rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon International). Subsequently, the cells were washed as before, air-dried, and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)/1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (DABCO). Caspase-9 enzymatic activity was measured with fluorometric assay kits specific to each caspase (R&D Systems). Cell were plated onto 100-mm culture dishes at 40–60% confluence, and caspase activity was measured according to the manufacturer’s protocol using a fluorescent microplate reader. Data were normalized using total protein concentration as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). To assess the Δψ, cells were plated onto 60 mm culture dishes at 40–60% confluence and incubated 1 h prior to the time point in the presence of two fluorescence probes, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE, excitation, 550 nm; emission, 580 nm; at 200 nm) and Mitotracker Green (MITO; excitation, 490 nm; emission, 515 nm; at 1 μm) (Molecular Probes). Cells were lysed with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and fluorescence was measured on a SpectraMax Gemini microplate reader (Molecular Devices). TMRE localizes within the mitochondria, and its fluorescence increases in proportion to the mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitotracker Green fluorescence localizes to the mitochondria independently of Δψ and reflects the number of mitochondria within a given cell. The ratio between TMRE fluorescence and MITO fluorescence reflects mitochondrial membrane potential normalized to the number of mitochondria. As a control for each condition, cells were incubated with both TMRE and MITO in the presence of the protonophore carbonyl cyanidep-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 20 μm) (Sigma), which dissipates the ψ. For each condition, the ratio of TMRE and MITO was subtracted from the TMRE/MITO ratio in the presence of FCCP [(TMRE/MITO) − (TMRE/MITO)FCCP]. The data presented are the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. Statistical significance was determined at the 0.05 level. Rat1a fibroblasts were treated with 0 and 100 μm DETA-NO for 24 and 48 h under normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1.5% O2), and cell death was determined by LDH release. At 24 h, Rat1a fibroblasts exposed to 100 μm DETA-NO under 1.5% O2 displayed similar cell death as cells under 21% O2 (Fig.1A). In contrast, at 48 h, Rat1a fibroblasts exposed to 100 μm NO under 1.5% O2 displayed a significantly increased cell death compared with cells treated with 100 μm NO under 21% O2 (Fig. 1A). To determine whether DETA-NO-mediated effects on cell death were through the generation of nitric oxide, Rat1a fibroblasts were exposed to 0 or 100 μm DETA-NO under 1.5% O2 in the presence of hemoglobin, a nitric oxide scavenger. Fig. 1B illustrates that hemoglobin prevents DETA-NO-induced cell death during hypoxia. To determine whether the cell death during hypoxia in the presence of DETA-NO was apoptotic, condensed and fragmented nuclei were examined with Hoechst staining in Rat1a fibroblasts exposed to 0 or 100 μm DETA-NO under 1.5% and 21% O2 for 48 h. Rat1a fibroblasts displayed a significant increase in apoptotic nuclei in the presence of 100 μm DETA-NO under 1.5% O2 compared with the cells exposed to 100 μm DETA NO under 21% O2 (Fig. 1,C and D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that prolonged hypoxia sensitizes cells to nitric oxide-induced apoptosis. Rat1a fibroblasts stably transfected with the control vector (neomycin) or Bcl-XL were treated with 0 or 100 μm DETA-NO under 21 and 1.5% O2 for 48 h, and cell death was determined by LDH release. DETA-NO-treated cells transfected with Bcl-XL did not display increased cell death under 1.5% O2 compared with 21% O2(Fig. 2A). In contrast, DETA-NO-treated neomycin control cells displayed an increase in cell death during 1.5% O2 compared with 21% O2(Fig. 2A). To determine the role of Bax or Bak in nitric oxide-induced cell death during hypoxia, murine embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type or bax−/−bak−/− were exposed to 0 μm or 100 μm DETA-NO under 21 and 1.5% O2 for 24 h and assessed for cell death by LDH release. Wild-type murine embryonic fibroblasts were sensitive to NO-induced death during hypoxia (Fig. 2B). In contrast,bax−/−bak−/− murine embryonic fibroblasts were resistant to NO-induced cell death during hypoxia. These results indicate that nitric oxide-induced cell death during hypoxia requires Bax or Bak and that cell death is prevented by Bcl-XL. To determine how long cells could survive nitric oxide exposure under 1.5% O2 before committing to apoptosis, neomycin control cells were exposed to 100 μm DETA-NO under 1.5% O2 for various time intervals. Subsequently, the DETA-NO was removed, and the cells were allowed to recover under 1.5% O2 for a total of 48 h. Neomycin control cells exposed to 100 μm DETA-NO for 9 h (followed by a 39-h incubation with 0 μm DETA-NO) did not display a significant cell death compared with cells incubated with 0 μm DETA-NO for the 48 h duration. However, cells exposed to 100 μm DETA-NO for 18 h followed by 30 h incubation with 0 μm DETA-NO did display a significant cell death compared with cells incubated with 0 μm DETA-NO for the 48 h duration. These results indicate that the commitment to NO-induced cell death under 1.5% O2 occurs between 9 and 18 h of exposure to NO (Fig.3A). To examine whether the commitment to die coincided with the release of cytochrome c, neomycin control and Bcl-XL cells were exposed to 0 and 100 μm DETA-NO under 21 and 1.5% O2. Mitochondrial cytochrome c release was examined at 9 and 18 h using a fluorescence-tagged anti-cytochromec antibody. Visualizing the cells under fluorescent microscopy, cytochrome c localized to the mitochondria displays a punctate pattern, whereas cytochrome c localized to the cytoplasm displays a diffuse pattern. Neither neomycin nor Bcl-XL cells released cytochrome c after 9 h with 100 μm DETA-NO under 1.5% O2 compared with cells exposed to 0 μm DETA-NO (data not shown). After 18 h of exposure to 100 μm DETA-NO under 1.5% O2, neomycin control cells had released cytochromec into the cytoplasm, whereas Bcl-XL cells maintained cytochrome c within the mitochondria (Fig.3B). Cytochrome c, following release from the mitochondria, has been shown to bind to Apaf-1, which then undergoes a conformational change that allows the cleavage and activation of caspase-9 (14Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar, 15Liu X. Kim C. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar). Neomycin control cells displayed a significantly greater -fold induction of caspase-9 compared with Bcl-XLcells after being exposed to 18 h of 100 μm DETA-NO at 1.5% O2 (Fig.4A). Previous studies suggest that the release of cytochrome c is accompanied by changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (33Vanderheiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Neomycin control and Bcl-XL cells were exposed to 100 μm DETA-NO under 1.5% O2 for 18 h, and inner mitochondrial membrane potential ψ was measured using the ratio between TMRE and MITO. In response to 100 μm DETA-NO and 1.5% O2, neomycin control cells at 18 h exhibited a significantly greater ψ depolarization compared with Bcl-XL cells (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that the commitment to death in response to NO during hypoxia is at the point of cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation. Prior studies speculate that the anti-apoptotic properties of Bcl-XL are attributed to the ability of this protein to maintain mitochondrial membrane homeostasis (33Vanderheiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar, 34Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies have suggested that cells undergoing electron transport inhibition by nitric oxide can continue to maintain a mitochondrial membrane potential through the utilization of glycolytic ATP by the reversal of the F1F0ATP synthase (11Beltran B. Mathur A. Duchen M.R. Erusalimsky J.D. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14602-14607Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). To determine whether functional glycolysis and a functional F1F0 ATP synthase are required for Bcl-XL to prevent nitric oxide-induced cell death under hypoxia, neomycin control and Bcl-XL cells were incubated for 24 h with 100 μm DETA-NO under 1.5% O2 in the presence and absence of the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG, 12 mm) and the F1F0 ATP synthase inhibitor, oligomycin (5 μm). Oligomycin and 2-DOG both independently caused cell death in neomycin control cells but not in Bcl-XL cells under normal oxygen conditions in the absence of DETA-NO (data not shown). Neomycin and Bcl-XL cells treated with nitric oxide during hypoxia underwent a non-apoptotic form of cell death in the presence of 2-DOG (Fig. 5). By contrast, Bcl-XL cells treated with nitric oxide during hypoxia underwent an apoptotic form of cell death in the presence of oligomycin (Fig. 6). These data suggest that glycolysis and a functional F1F0 ATP synthase are required for Bcl-XL to prevent nitric oxide-induced cell death under hypoxia.Figure 6A, Bcl-XL cells were treated for 24 h with 100 μm DETA-NO under 1.5% O2 in the presence or absence of the F1F0 ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin (Oligo, 5 μg/ml). B, percentage of apoptotic cells scored by Hoechst staining of Bcl-XL cells exposed to 100 μm DETA-NO under 1.5% O2 in the presence of oligomycin (5 μg/ml) for 24 h is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies have demonstrated that nitric oxide can combine with superoxide to generate the toxic free radical peroxynitrite (ONOO−) or activate guanylate cyclase to generate cGMP (3Moncada S. Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5661) Google Scholar, 35Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6647) Google Scholar). Both peroxynitrite and cGMP have been implicated in NO-induced apoptosis (21Brown G.C. Borutaite V. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 66: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Szabo C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 855-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 23Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

To determine whether the NO-induced death under 1.5% O2 was due to cGMP or peroxynitrite, Rat1a fibroblasts were exposed to 0 and 100 μm DETA-NO under 1.5% O2 for 48 h with the cGMP inhibitor H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) at 10 μm, the peroxynitrite scavenger ebselen at 10 μm, or the superoxide scavenger Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin (TBAP) at 150 μm. Although ODQ, ebselen, and TBAP had no significant cytotoxic effects, these compounds also did not have any protective effects against nitric oxide-induced cell death during hypoxia (Fig. 7). Ebselen and TBAP did prevent SIN-1-induced cell death. SIN-1 releases both superoxide and nitric oxide, thus generating peroxynitrite (Fig.7). This suggests that the increase in nitric oxide-induced cell death under hypoxia is independent of cGMP activity and peroxynitrite. A possible mechanism for the increase in nitric oxide-induced cell death under hypoxia is the direct inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport by nitric oxide. ATP levels were measured to examine whether electron transport was inhibited during hypoxia in the presence of nitric oxide. ATP levels decreased in both Neomycin and Bcl-XL cells in the presence of 100 μm DETA-NO during hypoxia (Fig.8). Oligomycin did not alter the ATP levels in neomycin or Bcl-XL cells in the presence of 100 μm DETA-NO during hypoxia, indicating that mitochondrial ATP generation was maximally inhibited by NO during hypoxia (Fig.8). In contrast, 2-DOG completely abolished ATP levels in both neomycin and Bcl-XL cells in the presence of 100 μm DETA-NO during hypoxia (Fig. 8). Thus, NO inhibits the generation of mitochondrial ATP during hypoxia, and glycolysis is the main source of ATP in these cells. To further elucidate the role of functional mitochondrial electron transport in nitric oxide-induced cell death during hypoxia, HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells containing cytochrome c but lacking a functional mitochondrial electron transport chain (ρ°-cells) were exposed to 0 or 100 μm DETA-NO under 21 and 1.5% O2 for 48 h and assessed for cell death by LDH release. Wild-type HT1080 cells displayed increased cell death in response to nitric oxide under hypoxia compared with normoxia, whereas ρ°-cells did not show an increase in nitric oxide-induced cell death under hypoxia (Fig. 9). These results suggest that NO-induced cell death under 1.5% O2requires a functional mitochondrial electron transport chain. Nitric oxide has been implicated in cellular injury and death in a variety of cells. Previous studies have examined NO-mediated cell death under normal oxygen conditions (1Chung H.-T. Hyun P. Choi B.M. Billiar T.R. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 3Moncada S. Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5661) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether hypoxia (1.5% O2) sensitized Rat1a fibroblasts to NO-induced cell death. DETA-NO administered at 100 μm was non-toxic under 21% O2. However, at this concentration cells underwent death under hypoxic conditions. NO-induced cell death under hypoxia is apoptotic and is preceded by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the activation of caspase-9. In cells exposed to hypoxia in the presence of nitric oxide, the commitment to death occurred at the point when cells released cytochrome c and activated caspase-9. The loss of cytochrome c was accompanied by the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptotic protein that localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane, was able to prevent the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of cytochrome c, caspase-9 activation, and cell death during hypoxia in the presence of NO. The ability of Bcl-XL to prevent apoptosis is attributed to its ability to negate the effects of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (17Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H.Y. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar, 18Zong W.X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Thus, either the overexpression Bcl-XL or the loss of Bax and Bak prevents apoptosis in response to a variety of death stimuli by inhibiting the release of cytochrome c. Indeed, we found that fibroblasts lacking Bax and Bak were resistant to nitric oxide-induced death during hypoxia. Taken together, our current observations suggest that Bcl-2 family members also regulate nitric oxide-induced apoptosis during hypoxia. Nitric oxide can combine with superoxide to form peroxynitrite, which can induce apoptosis by irreversibly inhibiting mitochondrial complex I, II, or V (21Brown G.C. Borutaite V. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 66: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that hypoxia can increase the generation of superoxide from mitochondrial complex III within minutes (36Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). One mechanism by which nitric oxide initiates cell death under hypoxia could be an irreversible inhibition of electron transport chain by peroxynitrite. However, our current data indicate that neither ebselen (peroxynitrite scavenger) nor TBAP (superoxide scavenger) prevented nitric oxide-induced cell death under hypoxia. Ebselen and TBAP did prevent SIN-1 (peroxynitrite generator)-induced cell death. Both ebselen and TBAP independently have been shown to inhibit peroxynitrite-mediated cell death in a variety of cells (37Wang J.F. Komarov P. Sies H. DeGroot H. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 1112-11116Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 38Sies H. Arteel G.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 39Estevez A.G. Spear N. Manuel S.M. Radi R. Henderson C.E. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 923-931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, peroxynitrite generation is not likely to be involved in initiating nitric oxide-induced cell death under hypoxia. It is well established that nitric oxide is a reversible competitive inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase with respect to oxygen (5Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar,6Cleeter M.W.J. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Moncada S. Schepra A.H.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). The affinity of cytochrome c oxidase for nitric oxide increases as oxygen tensions are decreased, resulting in the inhibition of cellular respiration, which reverses upon nitric oxide removal. Our current data demonstrate that cells exposed to 9 h of hypoxia in the presence of NO followed by 39 h of hypoxia alone did not undergo cytochrome c release or subsequent cell death. By contrast, cells exposed to NO for 18 h under hypoxic conditions had released cytochrome c and thus were committed to apoptosis. These data suggest that the effects of NO during hypoxia prior to cytochrome c release are reversible. Furthermore, ATP levels decreased during hypoxia in the presence of NO. Oligomycin, an inhibitor of the F1F0-ATP synthase that prevents the formation of mitochondrial generated ATP, did not further decrease ATP levels during hypoxia in the presence of NO. Therefore, NO inhibits the generation of mitochondrial ATP during hypoxia. The remaining ATP in cells exposed to NO during hypoxia was abolished by 2-DOG, indicating that glycolysis is the main source of ATP. The role of electron transport inhibition as the primary mechanism was further supported by the observation that ρ°-cells, cell that lack the catalytic subunits of cytochrome c oxidase but still contain a functional cytochrome c, failed to undergo cell death during hypoxia in the presence of NO. Previous studies have shown that ρ°-cells are susceptible to cell death in response to traditional apoptotic stimuli such as growth factor withdrawal and staurosporine, yet are resistant to cell death induced by electron transport inhibitors (40Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Collectively, our findings suggest that NO induces cell death during hypoxia by inhibiting the electron transport chain at the level of cytochrome c oxidase. If the mechanism of nitric oxide-induced cell death under hypoxia was due to a reversible inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport, then how does an outer mitochondrial membrane protein like Bcl-XL act to protect cells against cell death? A simple explanation is that Bcl-XL suppresses the apoptotic actions of Bax or Bak. However, cells would still have to maintain their mitochondrial membrane potential in the absence of a functioning electron transport chain during hypoxia in the presence of nitric oxide. Under normal physiological conditions, electron transfer through the respiratory chain is coupled to the directional movement of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This movement across the membrane establishes a pH gradient and a membrane potential that provides the thermodynamic driving force for F1F0-ATP synthase to generate ATP in the matrix. Recently, it was demonstrated that nitric oxide-induced inhibition of electron transport under normal oxygen tensions resulted in the hydrolysis of glycolytic ATP by F1F0-ATP synthase, which extrudes protons from the matrix in an attempt to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential (11Beltran B. Mathur A. Duchen M.R. Erusalimsky J.D. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14602-14607Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Bcl-XL was not able to prevent cell death in the presence of either a glycolytic inhibitor or a F1F0 ATP synthase inhibitor. We speculate that Bcl-XL prevents Bax or Bak from initiating cytochrome c release, thus allowing glycolysis and F1F0 ATP synthase to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. In summary, our present data demonstrate that low oxygen tensions sensitize cells to nitric oxide-induced cell death through a mechanism dependent on pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and the inhibition of functional electron transport. Limited exposure of cells to nitric oxide under hypoxia may allow for full cell recovery and viability, with mitochondrial membrane homeostasis being maintained through utilization of glycolytic ATP. By contrast, extended continuous exposure to nitric oxide activates mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Further studies examining the mechanisms underlying increased nitric oxide-induced cell death under hypoxia may give us insight into the pathogenesis of cell death in the setting of excess nitric oxide production and hypoxia as exists in sepsis-related organ damage and dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2147352787,"The cellular function of the oncogene bcl-2, a key regulator of apoptosis, is still debated. The goal of this study was to explore the relationship between BCL-2 overexpression and cell volume regulation by using two independent models, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells stably transfected with BCL-2 and MDCK clones with inducible BCL-2 expression by the lac operator/repressor. BCL-2 overexpression enhanced the capability of regulatory volume decrease (RVD), a cellular defensive process against hypotonic stress. In various clones of MDCK cells, hypotonic stress induced an outwardly rectified Cl(-) current that was significantly up-regulated by BCL-2 overexpression. Other fundamental characteristics of this channel were similar among different MDCK clones, such as sensitivity to Cl(-) channel inhibitor, anion permeability, and time-dependent inactivation at more positive potential. Most importantly, BCL-2 overexpression up-regulates the swelling-activated Ca(2+) transient that is a critical signaling for normal RVD and the activation of swelling-activated Cl(-) channel in MDCK cells. BCL-2 overexpression also enhances the capacitative Ca(2+) entry that can be differentiated from the swelling-activated Ca(2+) transient by kinetic analysis and sensitivity to Gd(3+). Moreover, neutralization of endogenous BCL-2 by antibody blocks the normal RVD response and the activation of swelling-activated Cl(-) channel in human cervical cancer HT-3 cells. These results provide a new insight into the novel function of BCL-2 overexpression in the regulation of cell volume and ion flux."
