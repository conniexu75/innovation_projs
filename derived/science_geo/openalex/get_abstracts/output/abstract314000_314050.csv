The first is based on the Greenland air temperature record obtained from isotopic studies of the Camp Century ice core. The second is based on the oxygen isotope record of benthic foraminifera from a deep Pacific Ocean core."
https://openalex.org/W2074610539,"The kinetics of the Fe2+-Mg, order-disorder phenomenon in a highly ordered natural anthophyllite have been determined over the temperature range from 400° to 720°C at a pressure of 2 kilobars. At temperatures of 600°C and above, equilibrium is attained by disordering as well as ordering reactions. The intracrystalline exchange is defined by a standard Gibbs free energy of 4247 ± 54 calories per formula unit. Rate studies at 550° and 500°C show that equilibrium is attained by ordering but not by disordering within the same time scale and that the exchange reaction is characterized by an activation energy of ∼55 kilocalories per formula unit. An equilibration temperature for the natural anthophyllite of 270°C is determined from the termination of the ordering process owing to excessively slow reaction kinetics after ∼107 years. From the rate constants of the exchange process, for different crystallization temperatures, the apparent equilibration temperature of 270°C defines a maximum linear cooling rate for the rock of 1 × 104°C per year."

However, there was no increase in the phosphorus concentrations of a lake and its input stream. This indicates that, under similar circumstances, controlled burning will not damage streams or lakes by elevating phosphorus levels."
https://openalex.org/W2087712494,Measurements of the temporal variation in the stratospheric nitric oxide concentration covering a time period from 11:00 to 20:30 local time show the effect of solar ultraviolet sunset. The experimental results strongly support the theorized role of nitric oxide as a catalyst in the destruction of ozone and its importance in the stratospheric ozone balance.

Staining with benzidine indicates that the encrustation is rich in manganese. This has been confirmed by x-ray analysis in combination with a scanning electron microscope."

https://openalex.org/W2082257485,"In outlining the physics of neutron stars, and my good fortune in stumbling upon them, I hope that I have given some idea of the interest and rewards of extending physics beyond the confines of laboratories. These are good times in which to be an astrophysicist. I am also deeply aware of my debt to all my colleagues in the Cavendish Laboratory. Firstly to Sir Martin Ryle for his unique flair in creating so congenial and stimulating a team in which to work. Secondly to Jocelyn Bell for the care, diligence, and persistence that led to our discovery so early in the scintillation program, and finally to my friends who contributed so generously in many aspects of the work."

https://openalex.org/W2029273305,The World Population Plan of Action adopted at the World Population Conference held in Bucharest in August 1974 was hesitant but adequate for countries desiring to limit their population growth. The Conference stressed an upgrading of the status of women the right of individuals to control their own fertility and the interrelationship between a growing population and the use of resources. A regional conference held in Bangkok in January 1975 established national goals and timetables for provision of family planning services and reduction of birthrates to replacement levels. 26 countries adopted these goals. The status of women must be improved worldwide as a necessary prelude to the success of the family planning movement worldwide. The U.N. World Conference of the International Womens Year which will be held in Mexico City in June 1975 may indicate the commitment of governments to solving population and quality of life problems.
