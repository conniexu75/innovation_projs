https://openalex.org/W2605671347,"Mini-G proteins are the engineered GTPase domains of Gα subunits. They couple to GPCRs and recapitulate the increase in agonist affinity observed upon coupling of a native heterotrimeric G protein. Given the small size and stability of mini-G proteins, and their ease of expression and purification, they are ideal for biophysical studies of GPCRs in their fully active state. The first mini-G protein developed was mini-Gs. Here we extend the family of mini-G proteins to include mini-Golf, mini-Gi1, mini-Go1 and the chimeras mini-Gs/q and mini-Gs/i. The mini-G proteins were shown to couple to relevant GPCRs and to form stable complexes with purified receptors that could be purified by size exclusion chromatography. Agonist-bound GPCRs coupled to a mini-G protein showed higher thermal stability compared to the agonist-bound receptor alone. Fusion of GFP at the N-terminus of mini-G proteins allowed receptor coupling to be monitored by fluorescence-detection size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) and, in a separate assay, the affinity of mini-G protein binding to detergent-solubilised receptors was determined. This work provides the foundation for the development of any mini-G protein and, ultimately, for the structure determination of GPCRs in a fully active state."
https://openalex.org/W2604815951,"Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is an established technique for the measurement of body composition. Reference values for these variables, particularly those related to fat mass, are necessary for interpretation and accurate classification of those at risk for obesity-related health complications and in need of lifestyle modifications (diet, physical activity, etc.). Currently, there are no reference values available for GE-Healthcare DXA systems and it is known that whole-body and regional fat mass measures differ by DXA manufacturer.To develop reference values by age and sex for DXA-derived fat mass measurements with GE-Healthcare systems.A de-identified sample of 3,327 participants (2,076 women, 1,251 men) was obtained from Ball State University's Clinical Exercise Physiology Laboratory and University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Physical Activity & Health Research Laboratory. All scans were completed using a GE Lunar Prodigy or iDXA and data reported included percent body fat (%BF), fat mass index (FMI), and ratios of android-to-gynoid (A/G), trunk/limb, and trunk/leg fat measurements. Percentiles were calculated and a factorial ANOVA was used to determine differences in the mean values for each variable between age and sex.Normative reference values for fat mass variables from DXA measurements obtained from GE-Healthcare DXA systems are presented as percentiles for both women and men in 10-year age groups. Women had higher (p<0.01) mean %BF and FMI than men, whereas men had higher (p<0.01) mean ratios of A/G, trunk/limb, and trunk/leg fat measurements than women.These reference values provide clinicians and researchers with a resource for interpretation of DXA-derived fat mass measurements specific to use with GE-Healthcare DXA systems."
https://openalex.org/W2607267260,"The transmission of infectious diseases has been studied by mathematical methods since 1760s, among which SIR model shows its advantage in its epidemiological description of spread mechanisms. Here we established a modified SIR model with nonlinear incidence and recovery rates, to understand the influence by any government intervention and hospitalization condition variation in the spread of diseases. By analyzing the existence and stability of the equilibria, we found that the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is not a threshold parameter, and our model undergoes backward bifurcation when there is limited number of hospital beds. When the saturated coefficient a is set to zero, it is discovered that the model undergoes the Saddle-Node bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation, and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2. The bifurcation diagram can further be drawn near the cusp type of the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 3 by numerical simulation. We also found a critical value of the hospital beds bc at [Formula: see text] and sufficiently small a, which suggests that the disease can be eliminated at the hospitals where the number of beds is larger than bc. The same dynamic behaviors exist even when a ≠ 0. Therefore, it can be concluded that a sufficient number of the beds is critical to control the epidemic."

Apoptosis and fibrosis signaling initiated by the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is known to contribute to these maladaptive effects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether reduction of ERS by a known chemical chaperone, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can attenuate pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling in a mouse model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Oral administration of TUDCA at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight (BW) in the TUDCA-TAC group reduced ERS markers (GRP78, p-PERK, and p-eIf2α), compared to the Vehicle (Veh)-TAC group. TUDCA administration, for 4 weeks after TAC significantly reduced cardiac hypertrophy as shown by the reduced heart weight (HW) to BW ratio, and expression of hypertrophic marker genes (ANF, BNP, and α-SKA). Masson's trichrome staining showed that myocardial fibrosis and collagen deposition were also significantly reduced in the TUDCA-TAC group. We also found that TUDCA significantly decreased expression of TGF-β signaling proteins and collagen isoforms. TUDCA administration also reduced cardiac apoptosis and the related proteins in the TUDCA-TAC group. Microarray analysis followed by gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis demonstrated that extracellular matrix genes responsible for hypertrophy and fibrosis, and mitochondrial genes responsible for apoptosis and fatty acid metabolism were significantly altered in the Veh-TAC group, but the alterations were normalized in the TUDCA-TAC group, suggesting potential of TUDCA in treatment of heart diseases related to pressure-overload."
https://openalex.org/W2606308463,"Load information plays an important role in deregulated electricity markets, since it is the primary factor to make critical decisions on production planning, day-to-day operations, unit commitment and economic dispatch. Being able to predict the load for a short term, which covers one hour to a few days, equips power generation facilities and traders with an advantage. With the deregulation of electricity markets, a variety of short term load forecasting models are developed. Deregulation in Turkish Electricity Market has started in 2001 and liberalization is still in progress with rules being effective in its predefined schedule. However, there is a very limited number of studies for Turkish Market. In this study, we introduce two different models for current Turkish Market using Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and present their comparative performances. Building models that cope with the dynamic nature of deregulated market and are able to run in real-time is the main contribution of this study. We also use our ANN based model to evaluate the effect of several factors, which are claimed to have effect on electrical load."
https://openalex.org/W2606311403,"Hemoglobin glycation index (HGI), defined as the difference between the observed HbA1c value and the value of HbA1c predicted from plasma glucose levels, represents a measure of the degree of non-enzymatic glycation of hemoglobin and it has been found to be positively associated with micro- and macro-vascular complications in subjects with type 2 diabetes. To investigate the pathophysiological abnormalities responsible for the increased cardiovascular risk of patients with higher HGI, we evaluated the association of HGI with cardio-metabolic characteristics in nondiabetic offspring of type 2 diabetic individuals. Insulin sensitivity, measured by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, cardio-metabolic risk factors including lipid profile, uric acid and inflammatory factors, and ultrasound measurement of carotid intima–media thickness (IMT) were assessed in 387 nondiabetic individuals. Participants were stratified in tertiles according to HGI (high, moderate and low). As compared with subjects with low HGI, those with high HGI displayed an unfavorable cardio-metabolic risk profile having significantly higher values of BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, uric acid, fasting insulin, inflammatory markers, such as high sensitivity C reactive protein, erythrocytes sedimentation rate, complement C3, fibrinogen, and white blood cell count, and carotid IMT, and lower HDL and insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. In a linear regression analysis model including several atherosclerotic risk factors such as gender, age, BMI, inflammatory factors, lipid profile, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, fasting insulin, uric acid, and blood pressure, HGI was the major predictor of IMT (β = 0.35; P = 0.001). In a logistic regression analysis adjusted for confounders, individuals with high HGI showed a 2.7-fold increased risk of vascular atherosclerosis (OR 2.72, 95%CI 1.01–7.37) as compared with subjects with low HGI. The present findings support the notion that HGI may be a useful tool to identify a subset of nondiabetic individuals conceivably harboring a higher risk of cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2605588638,"Evaluation of impaired left ventricular (LV) filling has focused on intrinsic causes of LV dysfunction; however, pulmonary vascular changes may contribute to reduced LV filling and dyspnea. We hypothesized that lower total pulmonary vascular volume (TPVV) on computed tomography (CT) would be associated with dyspnea and decrements in LV end-diastolic volume, particularly among ever-smokers.The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis recruited adults without clinical cardiovascular disease in 2000-02. In 2010-12, TPVV was ascertained as the volume of arteries and veins in the lungs detectable on non-contrast chest CT (vessels ≥1 mm diameter). Cardiac measures were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dyspnea was self-reported.Of 2303 participants, 53% had ever smoked cigarettes. Among ever-smokers, a lower TPVV was associated with a lower LV end-diastolic volume (6.9 mL per SD TPVV), stroke volume, and cardiac output and with dyspnea (all P-values <0.001). Findings were similar among those without lung disease and those with 0-10 pack-years but were mostly non-significant among never-smokers. TPVV was associated smaller left atrial volume but not with LV ejection fraction or MRI measures of impaired LV relaxation. In a second sample of ever-smokers, a lower pulmonary microvascular blood volume on contrast-enhanced MRI was also associated with a lower LV end-diastolic volume (P-value = 0.008).Reductions in pulmonary vascular volume were associated with lower LV filling and dyspnea among ever-smokers, including those without lung disease, suggesting that smoking-related pulmonary vascular changes may contribute to symptoms and impair cardiac filling and function without evidence of impaired LV relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W2605874011,"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a contagious disease listed by the World Organisation for Animal health (OIE) as being a specific hazard. It affects sheep, goats, and wild ungulates, and is prevalent throughout the developing world particularly Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. PPR has been targeted for eradication by 2030 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the OIE, after the successful eradication of the related disease, rinderpest in cattle. PPR was first reported in 1942 in the Ivory Coast in Western Africa and has since extended its range in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa posing an immediate threat of incursion into Europe, South East Asia and South Africa. Although robust vaccines are available, the use of these vaccines in a systematic and rational manner is not widespread, resulting in this devastating disease becoming an important neglected tropical disease in the developing world.We isolated and characterized the PPR virus from an outbreak in Cheraga, northern Algeria, during October 2015 by analyzing the partial N-gene sequence in comparison with other viruses from the Maghreb region. As well as sequencing the full length viral genome and performing real-time RT-PCR on clinical samples. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian temporal and phylogeographic analyses were performed to assess the persistence and spread of PPRV circulation from Eastern Africa in the Maghreb region of North Africa.Recent PPR outbreaks in Cheraga, in the northern part of Algiers (October 2015) and North-West Morocco (June, 2015) highlight that PPRV has spread to the northern border of North Africa and may pose a threat of introduction to Europe. Phylogeographic analysis suggests that lineage IV PPRV has spread from Eastern Africa, most likely from the Sudan 2000 outbreak, into Northern Africa resulting in the 2008 Moroccan outbreak. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analysis shows that these North African viruses cluster closely together suggesting the existence of continual regional circulation. Considering the same virus is circulating in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, implementation of a common Maghreb PPR eradication strategy would be beneficial for the region."
https://openalex.org/W4234567378,"Body composition assessments commonly focus predominantly on fat mass, however lean mass (LM) measurements also provide useful information regarding clinical and nutritional status. LM measurements help predict health outcomes and diagnose sarcopenia, which has been associated with frailty. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is an established technique used in clinical and research settings to assess body composition including total and regional LM. Currently, there are no reference values available that were derived from GE-Healthcare DXA systems directly for US adults for LM, LM index (LMI), percent LM (%LM), and appendicular lean mass index (ALMI) and it is known that whole-body and regional LM measures differ by DXA manufacturer. Objective To develop reference values by age and sex for LM measures using GE-Healthcare DXA systems. Methods A de-identified sample was obtained from Ball State University’s Clinical Exercise Physiology Laboratory and University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee’s Physical Activity & Health Research Laboratory. DXA scans of 2,076 women and 1,251 men were completed using a GE Lunar Prodigy or iDXA. Percentiles (%ile) were calculated for all variables of interest (LM, LMI, %LM, and ALMI) and a factorial ANOVA was used to assess differences for each variable between 10-year age groups and sex, as well as the interaction between age and sex. Results Men had higher mean total LM, %LM, LMI, and ALMI than women (p<0.01), across all age groups. All LM variables decreased significantly over the 5 decades in men, however in women only total LM, %LM, and ALMI decreased from the youngest to oldest age groups (p<0.01). Conclusion These reference values provide for a more accurate interpretation of GE-Healthcare DXA-derived LM measurements offering clinicians and researchers with an initial resource to aid in the early detection and assessment of LM deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2605850761,"Cultural differences in spatial perception have been little investigated, which gives rise to the impression that spatial cognitive processes might be universal. Contrary to this idea, we demonstrate cultural differences in spatial volume perception of computer generated rooms between Germans and South Koreans. We used a psychophysical task in which participants had to judge whether a rectangular room was larger or smaller than a square room of reference. We systematically varied the room rectangularity (depth to width aspect ratio) and the viewpoint (middle of the short wall vs. long wall) from which the room was viewed. South Koreans were significantly less biased by room rectangularity and viewpoint than their German counterparts. These results are in line with previous notions of general cognitive processing strategies being more context dependent in East Asian societies than Western ones. We point to the necessity of considering culturally-specific cognitive processing strategies in visual spatial cognition research."
https://openalex.org/W2606698293,"The evaluation of patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the burden associated with this disease. The aim of this study was to assess the overall impact of TB on the health status and on single health domains identified in the WHO definition of health, including physical, mental and social health aspects.Four instruments for HRQOL evaluation were applied in a longitudinal multicentre study during six-month standard TB treatment in South Africa. These included the generic SF-12 and EQ-5D-5L, the disease-specific St. George´s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the condition-specific Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Statistical analysis included significance testing, univariable and multivariable analysis, and repeated measures ANOVA. Change over time in the physical component score (PCS) of SF-12 was defined as primary endpoint. A target sample size of 96 patients was estimated.HRQOL of the study participants was impaired in all physical, mental and psycho-social health domains at treatment start. HRQOL improved significantly and in a clinically meaningful manner during the course of standard TB treatment, over the period of the study. The greatest improvement (95%) was observed in mental health. Younger patients with higher education and who were employed had a better HRQOL.This study demonstrates the need for an integrative understanding of TB with HRQOL as core element to inform gaps in current TB management. Improvements in the management of TB following an integrative patient-centred approach will contribute towards meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3) target and will support the End TB strategy of the WHO."
https://openalex.org/W2606052718,"Analyzing how climate change affects vegetation distribution is one of the central issues of global change ecology as this has important implications for the carbon budget of terrestrial vegetation. Mapping vegetation distribution under historical climate scenarios is essential for understanding the response of vegetation distribution to future climatic changes. The reconstructions of palaeovegetation based on pollen data provide a useful method to understand the relationship between climate and vegetation distribution. However, this method is limited in time and space. Here, using species distribution model (SDM) approaches, we explored the climatic determinants of contemporary vegetation distribution and reconstructed the distribution of Chinese vegetation during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 18,000 14C yr BP) and Middle-Holocene (MH, 6000 14C yr BP). The dynamics of vegetation distribution since the LGM reconstructed by SDMs were largely consistent with those based on pollen data, suggesting that the SDM approach is a useful tool for studying historical vegetation dynamics and its response to climate change across time and space. Comparison between the modeled contemporary potential natural vegetation distribution and the observed contemporary distribution suggests that temperate deciduous forests, subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests, temperate deciduous shrublands and temperate steppe have low range fillings and are strongly influenced by human activities. In general, the Tibetan Plateau, North and Northeast China, and the areas near the 30°N in Central and Southeast China appeared to have experienced the highest turnover in vegetation due to climate change from the LGM to the present."
https://openalex.org/W2605703306,"Organisms have evolved the ability to tolerate toxic substances in their environments, often by producing metabolic enzymes that efficiently detoxify the toxicant. Inorganic arsenic is one of the most toxic and carcinogenic substances in the environment, but many organisms, including humans, metabolise inorganic arsenic to less toxic metabolites. This multistep process produces mono-, di-, and trimethylated arsenic metabolites, which the organism excretes. In humans, arsenite methyltransferase (AS3MT) appears to be the main metabolic enzyme that methylates arsenic. In this study, we examined the evolutionary origin of AS3MT and assessed the ability of different genotypes to produce methylated arsenic metabolites. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that multiple, independent horizontal gene transfers between different bacteria, and from bacteria to eukaryotes, increased tolerance to environmental arsenic during evolution. These findings are supported by the observation that genetic variation in AS3MT correlates with the capacity to methylate arsenic. Adaptation to arsenic thus serves as a model for how organisms evolve to survive under toxic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2606740159,"This study uses several bibliometric indices to explore the temporal course of publication trends regarding the bilingual advantage in executive control over a ten-year window. These indices include the number of published papers, numbers of citations, and the journal impact factor. According to the information available in their abstracts, studies were classified into one of four categories: supporting, ambiguous towards, not mentioning, or challenging the bilingual advantage. Results show that the number of papers challenging the bilingual advantage increased notably in 2014 and 2015. Both the average impact factor and the accumulated citations as of June 2016 were equivalent between categories. However, of the studies published in 2014, those that challenge the bilingual advantage accumulated more citations in June 2016 than those supporting it. Our findings offer evidence-based bibliometric information about the current state of the literature and suggest a change in publication trends regarding the literature on the bilingual advantage."
https://openalex.org/W2607029815,"Hip fracture is a common health problem in the elderly that is associated with increased mortality. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in elderly patients undergoing surgery and is associated with the clinical outcome. We evaluated the incidence and risk factors of AKI in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery and the impact of AKI on short- and long-term clinical outcomes.We performed a retrospective cohort study of 450 elderly patients who underwent hip fracture surgery between January 2010 and December 2012. We defined AKI according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria and investigated the effect of AKI on the duration of hospital stay and in-hospital and long-term mortality.Of the 450 patients, 95 (21.1%) developed AKI during hospitalization and 178 (39.6%) died, with a mean follow-up of 3.6 ± 1.0 years. The baseline serum creatinine level, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, red blood cell transfusion volume, and history of coronary artery disease were independent risk factors for AKI. Patients with AKI during hospitalization had significantly longer hospital stays and higher in-hospital and long-term mortality than those without AKI. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, history of coronary artery disease, serum albumin level, and AKI were independent predictors of long-term mortality.AKI is a frequent complication in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery and is independently associated with increased in-hospital and long-term mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2606297194,"Gastric cancer, a leading worldwide cause of cancer mortality, shows high geographic and ethnic variation in incidence rates, which are highest in East Asia. The anatomic locations and clinical behavior also differ by geography, leading to the controversial idea that Eastern and Western forms of the disease are distinct. In view of these differences, we investigated whether gastric cancers from Eastern and Western patients show distinct genomic profiles. We used high-density profiling of somatic copy-number aberrations to analyze the largest collection to date of gastric adenocarcinomas and utilized genotyping data to rigorously annotate ethnic status. The size of this collection allowed us to accurately identify regions of significant copy-number alteration and separately to evaluate tumors arising in Eastern and Western patients. Among molecular subtypes classified by The Cancer Genome Atlas, the frequency of gastric cancers showing chromosomal instability was modestly higher in Western patients. After accounting for this difference, however, gastric cancers arising in Easterners and Westerners have highly similar somatic copy-number patterns. Only one genomic event, focal deletion of the phosphatase gene PTPRD, was significantly enriched in Western cases, though also detected in Eastern cases. Thus, despite the different risk factors and clinical features, gastric cancer appears to be a fundamentally similar disease in both populations and the divergent clinical outcomes cannot be ascribed to different underlying structural somatic genetic aberrations."
https://openalex.org/W2606479927,"Toxic effects of cadmium (Cd), a common soil pollutant, are still not very well understood, particularly in regard to its epigenetic impact. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess DNA methylation changes and their persistence in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris upon chronic low dose Cd exposure using methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP). Moreover, the biomarker response and fitness of the earthworms, as well as the expression of detoxification-related genes (metallothionein (MT) and phytochelatin synthase (PCS)) was evaluated. Low levels of Cd caused an increase in genome-wide DNA methylation, which remained partly modified, even after several months of recovery in unpolluted soil. Increased cellular stress seemed to decrease after two weeks of exposure whereas fitness parameters remained unaffected by Cd, probably as a result from the activation of detoxification mechanisms like the expression of MTs. Interestingly, even though the level of Cd exposure was very low, MT expression levels indicate the development of acclimation mechanisms. Taken together, this study demonstrates that acclimation, as well as epigenetic modifications can occur already in moderately polluted environments. In addition, these effects can have long-lasting impacts on key species of soil invertebrates and might persist long after the actual heavy metal challenge has passed."
https://openalex.org/W2606567460,"Human serum albumin (HSA) has its ability to bind drug molecules and influence their efficacies. Although anticancer leads NSC48693 and NSC290956 functioned at the same mechanism, the drug efficacies were obviously distinct. To gain insight into the distinct drug efficacy, the molecular and physiological processes of anticancer leads binding HSA have been investigated via a combined experimental and theoretical approach. The binding site, as characterized by fluorescence quenching and molecular modeling, is found to be located at site II in subdomain III A for NSC48693 with tight binding and at site FA1 in subdomain I B for NSC290956 with negatively cooperative binding, respectively. As indicated by the thermodynamic analysis, NSC48693 binds to HSA with an enthalpy driven mechanism, while NSC290956 binding with HSA is entropically driven. The further kinetic analysis indicates that the association rates appear to be similar to these two anticancer leads, however, the dissociation rate of NSC48693 is approximately 5-fold slower than that of NSC290956. For NSC48693, the pharmacodynamic efficacy is less than that of NSC290956, while its pharmacokinetic behavior is better than that of NSC290956. These parameters influence the pharmacodynamic efficacy and pharmacokinetic behavior, which will give further impacts on drug efficacy in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2606700796,"Allatotropins (AT) are neuropeptides with pleotropic functions on a variety of insect tissues. They affect processes such as juvenile hormone biosynthesis, cardiac rhythm, oviduct and hindgut contractions, nutrient absorption and circadian cycle. The present work provides experimental evidence that AT elicits immune responses in two important mosquito disease vectors, Anopheles albimanus and Aedes aegypti. Hemocytes and an immune-competent mosquito cell line responded to AT by showing strong morphological changes and increasing bacterial phagocytic activity. Phenoloxidase activity in hemolymph was also increased in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes treated with AT but not in An. albimanus, suggesting differences in the AT-dependent immune activation in the two species. In addition, two important insect immune markers, nitric oxide levels and expression of antimicrobial peptide genes, were increased in An. albimanus guts after AT treatment. AT conjugated to quantum dot nanocrystals (QDots) specifically labeled hemocytes in vivo in both mosquito species, implying molecular interactions between AT and hemocytes. The results of our studies suggest a new role for AT in the modulation of the immune response in mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W2605670891,"The growth and maturity of cattle body size affect not only feed efficiency, but also productivity and longevity. Dissecting the genetic architecture of body size is critical for cattle breeding to improve both efficiency and productivity. The volume and weight of body size are indicated by several measurements. Among them, Heart Girth (HG) and Hip Height (HH) are the most important traits. They are widely used as predictors of body weight (BW). Few association studies have been conducted for HG and HH in cattle focusing on single growth stage. In this study, we extended the Genome-wide association studies to a full spectrum of four growth stages (6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-months after birth) in Chinese Holstein heifers. The whole genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained from the Illumina BovineSNP50 v2 BeadChip genotyped on 3,325 individuals. Estimated breeding values (EBVs) were derived for both HG and HH at the four different ages and analyzed separately for GWAS by using the Fixed and random model Circuitous Probability Unification (FarmCPU) method. In total, 27 SNPs were identified to be significantly associated with HG and HH at different growth stages. We found 66 candidate genes located nearby the associated SNPs, including nine genes that were known as highly related to development and skeletal and muscular growth. In addition, biological function analysis was performed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and an interaction network related to development was obtained, which contained 16 genes out of the 66 candidates. The set of putative genes provided valuable resources and can help elucidate the genomic architecture and mechanisms underlying growth traits in dairy cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2605789684,"The fate of Northern peatlands under climate change is important because of their contribution to global carbon (C) storage. Peatlands are maintained via greater plant productivity (especially of Sphagnum species) than decomposition, and the processes involved are strongly mediated by climate. Although some studies predict that warming will relax constraints on decomposition, leading to decreased C sequestration, others predict increases in productivity and thus increases in C sequestration. We explored the lack of congruence between these predictions using single-species and integrated species distribution models as proxies for understanding the environmental correlates of North American Sphagnum peatland occurrence and how projected changes to the environment might influence these peatlands under climate change. Using Maximum entropy and BIOMOD modelling platforms, we generated single and integrated species distribution models for four common Sphagnum species in North America under current climate and a 2050 climate scenario projected by three general circulation models. We evaluated the environmental correlates of the models and explored the disparities in niche breadth, niche overlap, and climate suitability among current and future models. The models consistently show that Sphagnum peatland distribution is influenced by the balance between soil moisture deficit and temperature of the driest quarter-year. The models identify the east and west coasts of North America as the core climate space for Sphagnum peatland distribution. The models show that, at least in the immediate future, the area of suitable climate for Sphagnum peatland could expand. This result suggests that projected warming would be balanced effectively by the anticipated increase in precipitation, which would increase Sphagnum productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2605853630,"Background Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which is the most common head and neck cancer, accounts for 1%–2% of all human malignancies and is characterized by poor prognosis and reduced survival rates. WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1), a cysteine-rich protein belonging to the Cyr61, CTGF, Nov (CCN) family of matricellular proteins, has many developmental functions and may be involved in carcinogenesis. This study investigated WISP1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to elucidate OSCC susceptibility and clinicopathologic characteristics. Methodology/Principal findings Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze 6 SNPs of WISP1 in 900 OSCC patients and 1200 cancer-free controls. The results showed that WISP1 rs2929970 polymorphism carriers with at least one G allele were susceptible to OSCC. Moreover, compared with smokers, non-smoker patients with higher frequencies of WISP1 rs2929970 (AG + GG) variants had a late stage (stages III and IV) and a large tumor size. In addition, OSCC patients who were betel quid chewers and carried WISP1 rs16893344 (CT + TT) variants had a low risk of lymph node metastasis. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that a joint effect of WISP1 rs2929970 with smoking as well as WISP1 rs16893344 with betel nut chewing causally contributes to the occurrence of OSCC. WISP1 polymorphism may serve as a marker or a therapeutic target in OSCC."

The authors evaluated the role of particulate matter2.5 (PM2.5) in structural, geometric, and functional remodeling in hearts, using an experimental model of myocardial infarction.Seventy-five rats were divided into 5 groups: control (CG), CG exposed to PM2.5 pollution (CGP), myocardial infarcted group (MI), infarcted group immediately exposed to pollution (IGP-I), and infarcted group previously exposed to pollution and kept exposed after infarction (IGP-II). Greater deposition of interstitial collagen occurred in the left ventricle in CGP, MI, IGP-I, and IGP-II groups compared with that in controls (p = 0.002 CG vs CGP and p<0.0001 CG vs MI, IGP-I, and IGP-II). In the right ventricle, greater collagen deposition existed in CGP, MI, IGP-I, and IGP-II compared with that in CG (p<0.021 CG vs CGP and p<0.0001 CG vs MI, IGP-I, and IGP-II). At the end of the study, CG had a higher mean shortening fraction than the other groups had (p≤0.03). Left ventricular systolic diameter was lower in CG than in infarcted groups (p≤0.003). The infarcted groups had greater expression of TGF-β (p≤0.04). PM2.5 increased the expression of TGF-β in the IGP-II compared with the MI group (p = 0.004). The TNF-α gene was overexpressed in the IGP-II compared with the CGP group (p = 0.012). INF-γ gene expression was greater in IGP-II (p≤0.01). Oxidative stress analysis showed a higher glutathione concentration in CGP (p = 0.03), MI (p = 0.014), and IGP-I (p = 0.008) compared with that in CG.PM2.5 stimulates the deposition of fibrosis in the myocardium of healthy hearts, but not in infarcted hearts. PM2.5 modulates the inflammatory response, which was greater in the IGP-II group. It also modulates oxidative stress in healthy hearts but not in infarcted hearts."

The aims of this study were (1) to explore the effect of T140 in regulating degeneration of articular cartilage in vivo by targeted blocking of the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling pathway, and (2) to provide experimental evidence for the development of a novel OA-targeted pharmacotherapy. Thirty-six healthy Hartley guinea pigs were randomly divided into three groups: a T140-treated group (n = 12), a phosphate buffer saline control group (n = 12) and an untreated control group (n = 12). At 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks of treatment, SDF-1 in serum was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. At 12 weeks of treatment, the cartilage from knee tibial plateau in the knee joint was collected for H&E, Safranin-O staining and Mankin grading; measurement for mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-3, MMP-9 and MMP-13), aggrecan (ACAN) and collagen II (Col II) using RT-PCR; and measurement for Col II protein levels by western blot. Results showed that SDF-1 in serum increased in the T140 group and increased in the control groups. H&E and Safranin-O staining revealed less cartilage loss in T140-treated animals compared to controls. The mRNA levels of MMP-3, MMP-9 and MMP-13 in cartilage were much lower in the T140 group than other groups, but mRNA levels of ACAN and Col II in cartilage were higher in the T140-treated group. Col II protein levels in the T140 group and control groups were different. T140 can downregulate the expression of matrix-degrading enzyme and lessen the degeneration of cartilage by blocking the SDF-1/CRCR4 signaling pathway in vivo. This mechanism may present a pharmacological target for the treatment of OA."
https://openalex.org/W2606424903,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. Human WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) gene has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene in multiple cancers. We hypothesize that genetic variations in WWOX are associated with HCC risk.Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the WWOX gene were evaluated from 708 normal controls and 354 patients with HCC. We identified a significant association between a WWOX single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs73569323, and decreased risk of HCC. After adjustment for potential confounders, patients with at least one T allele at rs11545028 of WWOX may have a significantly smaller tumor size, reduced levels of α-fetoprotein and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Moreover, the A allele at SNP rs12918952 in WWOX conferred higher risk of vascular invasion. Additional in silico analysis also suggests that WWOX rs12918952 polymorphism tends to affect WWOX expression, which in turn contributes to tumor vascular invasion.In conclusion, genetic variations in WWOX may be a significant predictor of early HCC occurrence and a reliable biomarker for disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2607348499,"Objective To examine the therapeutic potential of stochastic vibrotactile stimulation (SVS) as a complementary non-pharmacological intervention for withdrawal in opioid-exposed newborns. Study design A prospective, within-subjects single-center study was conducted in 26 opioid-exposed newborns (>37 weeks; 16 male) hospitalized since birth and treated pharmacologically for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome. A specially-constructed mattress delivered low-level SVS (30-60Hz, 10–12μm RMS), alternated in 30-min intervals between continuous vibration (ON) and no vibration (OFF) over a 6–8 hr session. Movement activity, heart rate, respiratory rate, axillary temperature and blood-oxygen saturation were calculated separately for ON and OFF. Results There was a 35% reduction in movement activity with SVS (p<0.001), with significantly fewer movement periods >30 sec duration for ON than OFF (p = 0.003). Incidents of tachypneic breaths and tachycardic heart beats were each significantly reduced with SVS, whereas incidents of eupneic breaths and eucardic heart beats each significantly increased with SVS (p<0.03). Infants maintained body temperature and arterial-blood oxygen level independent of stimulation condition. Conclusions SVS reduced hyperirritability and pathophysiological instabilities commonly observed in pharmacologically-managed opioid-exposed newborns. SVS may provide an effective complementary therapeutic intervention for improving autonomic function in newborns with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2605861287,"Oct4 was reported to be one of the most important pluripotency transcription factors in the biology of stem cells including cancer stem cells, and progressed malignant cells. Here we report the investigation of gene expression control of Oct4 by selected human microRNAs and the physiological effect of Oct4 silencing in invasive cancer cells.High throughput luciferase activity assay revealed the microRNA-299-3p to be the most effective in reducing gene expression of Oct4, which was confirmed by Western blot analysis and Oct4 promoter activity in a target luciferase assay. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that downregulation of Oct4 by microRNAs-299-3p in breast cancer and fibrosarcoma cells lead to a decreased invasiveness in a microfluidic chip assay. Additionally, microRNA-299-3p causes apoptosis in cancer cells. Comparison with Oct4 specific siRNA transfection confirmed that this effect is primary due to the blockade of Oct4 expression.The results suggest that microRNA-299-3p is an interesting target for potential clinical use. It may be able to decrease invasive behaviour of carcinoma cells; or even kill these cells by causing apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2606844460,"The prolyl isomerase Pin1 plays a key role in the modulation of proline-directed phosphorylation signaling by inducing local conformational changes in phosphorylated protein substrates. Extensive studies showed different roles for Pin1 in physiological processes and pathological conditions such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are still several unanswered questions regarding its biological role. Notably, despite evidences from cultured cells showing that Pin1 expression and activity may be regulated by different mechanisms, little is known on their relevance in vivo. Using Danio rerio (zebrafish) as a vertebrate model organism we showed that pin1 expression is regulated during embryogenesis to achieve specific mRNA and protein distribution patterns. Moreover, we found different subcellular distribution in particular stages and cell types and we extended the study of Pin1 expression to the adult zebrafish brain. The analysis of Pin1 overexpression showed alterations on zebrafish development and the presence of p53-dependent apoptosis. Collectively, our results suggest that specific mechanisms are operated in different cell types to regulate Pin1 function."
https://openalex.org/W2606355738,"In Plasmodium falciparum holoendemic transmission regions of western Kenya, life-threatening pediatric malaria manifests primarily as severe malarial anemia (SMA, Hb≤6.0 g/dL with any density parasitemia). To determine the role that CD4+ T-cell-driven inflammatory responses have in the pathogenesis of SMA, peripheral CD4+ T-cell populations and their intracellular production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-17) were characterized in children aged 12–36 months of age stratified into two groups: non-severe malarial anemia (non-SMA, Hb≥6.0 g/dL, n = 50) and SMA (n = 39). In addition, circulating IFN-γ and IL-17 were measured as part of a Cytokine 25-plex Antibody Bead Kit, Human (BioSource™ International). Children with SMA had higher overall proportions of circulating lymphocytes (P = 0.003) and elevated proportions of lymphocytes expressing IFN-γ (P = 0.014) and comparable IL-17 (P = 0.101). In addition, SMA was characterized by decreased memory-like T-cells (CD4+CD45RA-) expressing IL-17 (P = 0.009) and lower mean fluorescence intensity in memory-like CD4+ T-cells for both IFN-γ (P = 0.063) and IL-17 (P = 0.006). Circulating concentrations of IFN-γ were higher in children with SMA (P = 0.009), while IL-17 levels were comparable between the groups (P = 0.164). Furthermore, circulating levels of IFN-γ were negatively correlated with IL-17 levels in both groups of children (SMA: r = -0.610, P = 0.007; and non-SMA: r = -0.516, P = 0.001), while production of both cytokines by lymphocytes were positively correlated (SMA: r = 0.349, P = 0.037; and non-SMA: r = 0.475, P = 0.001). In addition, this correlation was only maintained by the memory-like CD4+ T cells (r = 0.365, P = 0.002) but not the naïve-like CD4+ T cells. However, circulating levels of IFN-γ were only associated with naïve-like CD4+ T cells producing IFN-γ (r = 0.547, P = 0.028), while circulating levels of IL-17 were not associated with any of the cell populations. Taken together, these results suggest that enhanced severity of malarial anemia is associated with higher overall levels of circulating lymphocytes, enhanced intracellular production of IFN-γ by peripheral lymphocytes and high circulating IFN-γ levels. In addition, the observed inverse relationship between the circulating levels of IFN-γ and IL-17 together with the reduction in the levels of memory-like CD4+ T cells expressing IL-17 in children with SMA may suggest possible relocation of these cells in the deeper tissues for their pathological effect."
https://openalex.org/W2606770924,"Medulloblastoma is a fatal brain tumor in children, primarily due to the presence of treatment-resistant medulloblastoma stem cells. The energy metabolic pathway is a potential target of cancer therapy because it is often different between cancer cells and normal cells. However, the metabolic properties of medulloblastoma stem cells, and whether specific metabolic pathways are essential for sustaining their stem cell-like phenotype and radioresistance, remain unclear. We have established radioresistant medulloblastoma stem-like clones (rMSLCs) by irradiation of the human medulloblastoma cell line ONS-76. Here, we assessed reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondria function, oxygen consumption rate (OCR), energy state, and metabolites of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle in rMSLCs and parental cells. rMSLCs showed higher lactate production and lower oxygen consumption rate than parental cells. Additionally, rMSLCs had low mitochondria mass, low endogenous ROS production, and existed in a low-energy state. Treatment with the metabolic modifier dichloroacetate (DCA) resulted in mitochondria dysfunction, glycolysis inhibition, elongated mitochondria morphology, and increased ROS production. DCA also increased radiosensitivity by suppression of the DNA repair capacity through nuclear oxidization and accelerated the generation of acetyl CoA to compensate for the lack of ATP. Moreover, treatment with DCA decreased cancer stem cell-like characters (e.g., CD133 positivity and sphere-forming ability) in rMSLCs. Together, our findings provide insights into the specific metabolism of rMSLCs and illuminate potential metabolic targets that might be exploited for therapeutic benefit in medulloblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2607090380,"Cancer cells prefer aerobic glycolysis, but little is known about the underlying mechanism. Recent studies showed that the rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) directly phosphorylates H3 at threonine 11 (H3T11) to regulate gene expression and cell proliferation, revealing its non-metabolic functions in connecting glycolysis and histone modifications. We have reported that the yeast homolog of PKM2, Pyk1 phosphorylates H3T11 to regulate gene expression and oxidative stress resistance. But how glycolysis regulates H3T11 phosphorylation remains unclear. Here, using a series of glycolytic enzyme mutants and commercial available metabolites, we investigated the role of glycolytic enzymes and metabolites on H3T11 phosphorylation. Mutation of glycolytic genes including phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI1), enolase (ENO2), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI1), or folate biosynthesis enzyme (FOL3) significantly reduced H3T11 phosphorylation. Further study demonstrated that glycolysis regulates H3T11 phosphorylation by fueling the substrate, phosphoenonylpyruvate and the coactivator, FBP to Pyk1. Thus, our results provide a comprehensive view of how glycolysis modulates H3T11 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2606104326,"Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a subtype of mucinous adenocarcinoma mainly restricted to the peritoneal cavity and most commonly originating from the appendix. The genetic background of PMP is poorly understood and no targeted treatments are currently available for this fatal disease. While RAS signaling pathway is affected in most if not all PMP cases and over half of them also have a mutation in the GNAS gene, other genetic alterations and affected pathways are, to a large degree, poorly known. In this study, we sequenced whole coding genome of nine PMP tumors and paired normal tissues in order to identify additional, commonly mutated genes and signaling pathways affected in PMP. These exome sequencing results were validated with an ultra-deep amplicon sequencing method, leading to 14 validated variants. The validated results contain seven genes that contribute to the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. PKA pathway, which also contains GNAS, is a major player of overproduction of mucin, which is the characteristic feature of PMP. In addition to PKA pathway, we identified mutations in six genes that belong to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway, which is a key regulator of cell proliferation. Since either GNAS mutation or an alternative mutation in the PKA pathway was identified in 8/9 patients, inhibition of the PKA pathway might reduce mucin production in most of the PMP patients and potentially suppress disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2606159727,"Calvarial thinning and skull bone defects have been reported in infants with hypervitaminosis A. These findings have also been described in humans, mice and zebrafish with loss-of-function mutations in the enzyme CYP26B1 that degrades retinoic acid (RA), the active metabolite of vitamin A, indicating that these effects are indeed caused by too high levels of vitamin A and that evolutionary conserved mechanisms are involved. To explore these mechanisms, we have fed young mice excessive doses of vitamin A for one week and then analyzed the skull bones using micro computed tomography, histomorphometry, histology and immunohistochemistry. In addition, we have examined the effect of RA on gene expression in osteoblasts in vitro. Compared to a standard diet, a high dietary intake of vitamin A resulted in a rapid and significant reduction in calvarial bone density and suture diastasis. The bone formation rate was almost halved. There was also increased staining of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase in osteocytes and an increased perilacunar matrix area, indicating osteocytic osteolysis. Consistent with this, RA induced genes associated with bone degradation in osteoblasts in vitro. Moreover, and in contrast to other known bone resorption stimulators, vitamin A induced osteoclastic bone resorption on the endocranial surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2606264762,"The significance of glucagon in the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus is widely recognized, but the mechanisms underlying dysregulated glucagon secretion are still unclear. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms of glucagon dysregulation, using an in vitro model. Hamster-derived glucagon-secreting InR1G cells were exposed to high glucose (25 mM) levels for 12 h before analyzing glucagon secretion and the activity of components involved in insulin signaling. High-glucose treatment induced increased glucagon secretion in InR1G cells, which represents a hallmark of diabetes mellitus. This treatment reduced the phosphorylation of Akt, indicating the deterioration of insulin signaling. Simultaneously, oxidative stress and JNK activity were shown to be increased. The inhibition of JNK signaling resulted in the amelioration of high-glucose level-induced glucagon secretion. Abnormally elevated glucagon secretion in diabetes can be reproduced by high-glucose treatment of InR1G cells, and the involvement of high glucose-oxidative stress-JNK-insulin signaling pathway axis has been demonstrated. These data elucidate, at least partly, the previously unclear mechanism of abnormal glucagon secretion, providing insights into a potential novel approach to diabetes treatment, targeting glucagon."
https://openalex.org/W2606093679,"Purpose To quantify zonular weakness based on lens movement at the start of continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) and establish a classification system for it. Setting Kozawa Eye Hospital and Diabetes Center, Mito, Japan. Design Retrospective interventional case series. Methods We examined 402 consecutive eyes of 316 patients who underwent CCC, phacoemulsification and aspiration (PEA), and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. The movement of the lens capsule was measured using images from video recordings of the CCC procedure. Zonular weakness was classified based on the shifted distance: Grade I, less than 0.20 mm; Grade II, 0.20–0.39 mm; and Grade III, greater than 0.40 mm. For each of these grades, we examined the use of the capsule stabilization device during PEA, the surgical procedure for lens removal, and IOL fixation. Results We classified 276 eyes (68.6%) as Grade I, 102 eyes (25.4%) as Grade II, and 24 eyes (6.0%) as Grade III. As the grade increased, the use of the capsule stabilization device in PEA and scleral suture fixation of IOL increased. Conclusions Zonular weakness was quantified by measuring the movement of the lens capsule. An objective classification of zonular weakness based on lens movement may be useful for selecting the appropriate device and procedure during cataract surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2605816273,"Polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor (VDR) contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune conditions.We investigated the incidence of VDR polymorphisms (rs1544410-BsmI; rs7975232-ApaI; rs731236-TaqI) in a group of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC, n = 275) and in healthy controls (n = 376). Additionally, correlations of the VDR polymorphisms with clinical and biochemical factors of the disease were analysed.The genotype and allele distributions of these polymorphisms in PSC patients were similar to those observed in controls. However, the ApaI polymorphism was associated with an impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The generic SF-36 questionnaire showed that the Role-Physical (p = 0.01), Role-Emotional (p = 0.01), Physical Component Summary (p = 0.01) and Mental Component Summary (p = 0.003) scores were significantly affected. Similarly, the disease-specific questionnaires, PBC-40 and PBC-27, demonstrated that carriers of the C allele suffered from more severe Itch (p = 0.03 assessed by PBC-40 and PBC-27), more Fatigue (p = 0.02 assessed by PBC-40 and PBC-27) and Impaired Cognitive Capacity (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03). Correspondingly, individuals who were AA homozygotes (non-carriers of the C allele of ApaI) had higher summary scores for the Physical (p = 0.01) and Mental Components (p = 0.006) measured with SF-36. Moreover, they experienced less itch (p = 0.03) and less Fatigue (p = 0.03) and had better Cognitive Abilities (p = 0.04) as assessed by the PBC-40 and PBC-27 questionnaires. No associations between other VDR polymorphisms and clinical or laboratory findings were made.In summary, this study is the first to show that the ApaI polymorphisms in VDR may exert an effect on disease-related symptoms and quality of life in patients with PSC."
https://openalex.org/W2953361113,"The short and long term effects of polyploidization on the evolutionary fate of lineages is still unclear despite much interest. First recognized in land plants, it has become clear that polyploidization is widespread in eukaryotes, notably at the origin of vertebrates and teleost fishes. Many hypotheses have been proposed to link the species richness of lineages and whole genome duplications. For instance, the radiation time lag model suggests that paleopolyploidy would favour the apparition of new phenotypic traits, although the radiation of the lineage would not occur before a later dispersion event. Some results indicate that this model may be observed during land plant evolution. In this work, we test predictions of the radiation time lag model using both fossil data and molecular phylogenies in ancient and more recent teleost whole genome duplications. We fail to find any evidence of delayed increase of the species number after any of these events and conclude that paleopolyploidization still remains to be unambiguously linked to taxonomic diversity in teleosts."
https://openalex.org/W2605599762,"Concentrations of heme b were determined in a mesocosm experiment situated in Gullmar Fjord off Sweden. The mesocosm experiment lasted for ca. one hundred days and was characterised by the growth of a primary nutrient replete and a secondary nutrient deplete phytoplankton bloom. Heme b varied between 40 ± 10 pmol L-1 in the prebloom period up to a maximum of 700 ± 400 pmol L-1 just prior to the time of the primary chlorophyll a maximum. Thereafter, heme b concentrations decreased again to an average of 120 ± 60 pmol L-1. When normalised to total particulate carbon, heme b was most abundant during the initiation of the nutrient replete spring bloom, when ratios reached 52 ± 24 μmol mol-1; ten times higher than values observed both pre and post the primary bloom. Concentrations of heme b correlated with those of chlorophyll a. Nevertheless, differences were observed in the relative concentrations of the two parameters, with heme b concentrations increasing relative to chlorophyll a during the growth of the primary bloom, decreasing over the period of the secondary bloom and increasing again through the latter period of the experiment. Heme b abundance was therefore influenced by nutrient concentrations and also likely by changing community composition. In half of the mesocosms, pCO2 was elevated and maintained at ca.1000 μatm, however we observed no significant differences between heme b in plus or ambient pCO2 mesocosms, either in absolute terms, or relative to total particulate carbon and chlorophyll a. The results obtained in this study contribute to our understanding of the distribution of this significant component of the biogenic iron pool, and provide an iron replete coastal water end member that aids the interpretation of the distributions of heme b in more iron deplete open ocean waters."
https://openalex.org/W2606465758,"Individual-based models (IBMs) of human populations capture spatio-temporal dynamics using rules that govern the birth, behavior, and death of individuals. We explore a stochastic IBM of logistic growth-diffusion with constant time steps and independent, simultaneous actions of birth, death, and movement that approaches the Fisher-Kolmogorov model in the continuum limit. This model is well-suited to parallelization on high-performance computers. We explore its emergent properties with analytical approximations and numerical simulations in parameter ranges relevant to human population dynamics and ecology, and reproduce continuous-time results in the limit of small transition probabilities. Our model prediction indicates that the population density and dispersal speed are affected by fluctuations in the number of individuals. The discrete-time model displays novel properties owing to the binomial character of the fluctuations: in certain regimes of the growth model, a decrease in time step size drives the system away from the continuum limit. These effects are especially important at local population sizes of <50 individuals, which largely correspond to group sizes of hunter-gatherers. As an application scenario, we model the late Pleistocene dispersal of Homo sapiens into the Americas, and discuss the agreement of model-based estimates of first-arrival dates with archaeological dates in dependence of IBM model parameter settings."
https://openalex.org/W2530269064,"Network models of healthcare systems can be used to examine how providers collaborate, communicate, refer patients to each other. Most healthcare service network models have been constructed from patient claims data, using billing claims to link patients with providers. The data sets can be quite large, making standard methods for network construction computationally challenging and thus requiring the use of alternate construction algorithms. While these alternate methods have seen increasing use in generating healthcare networks, there is little to no literature comparing the differences in the structural properties of the generated networks. To address this issue, we compared the properties of healthcare networks constructed using different algorithms and the 2013 Medicare Part B outpatient claims data. Three different algorithms were compared: binning, sliding frame, and trace-route. Unipartite networks linking either providers or healthcare organizations by shared patients were built using each method. We found that each algorithm produced networks with substantially different topological properties. Provider networks adhered to a power law, and organization networks to a power law with exponential cutoff. Censoring networks to exclude edges with less than 11 shared patients, a common de-identification practice for healthcare network data, markedly reduced edge numbers and greatly altered measures of vertex prominence such as the betweenness centrality. We identified patterns in the distance patients travel between network providers, and most strikingly between providers in the Northeast United States and Florida. We conclude that the choice of network construction algorithm is critical for healthcare network analysis, and discuss the implications for selecting the algorithm best suited to the type of analysis to be performed."

Little is known about permanent and temporary predictors for severe overanticoagulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and predicting factors for episodes with very high (≥9) international normalized ratio (INR) values in warfarin treated patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Excessive Warfarin Anticoagulation (EWA) study screened all patients (n = 13618) in the Turku University Hospital region with an INR ≥2 between years 2003-2015. Patients using warfarin anticoagulation for AF with very high (≥9) INR values (EWA Group) were identified (n = 412 patients) and their characteristics were compared to a control group (n = 405) of AF patients with stable INR during long-term follow-up. Over 20% (n = 92) of the EWA patients had more than one event of very high INR and in 105 (25.5%) patients EWA led to a bleeding event. Of the several temporary and permanent EWA risk factors observed, strongest were excessive alcohol consumption in 9.6% of patients (OR 24.4, 95% CI 9.9-50.4, p<0.0001) and reduced renal function (OR 15.2, 95% CI 5.67-40.7, p<0.0001). Recent antibiotic or antifungal medication, recent hospitalization or outpatient clinic visit and the first 6 months of warfarin use were the most significant temporary risk factors for EWA. Excessive warfarin anticoagulation can be predicted with several permanent and temporary clinical risk factors, many of which are modifiable."

Methods From August 2003 to May 2005, we consecutively enrolled patients who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for health check-up purposes and showed no significant findings other than WMH of any degree. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not they received antiplatelet therapy. All patients had a follow-up brain MRI after 5 years and WMH volume change was measured using imaging analysis software. To minimize selection bias potentially arising from antiplatelet treatment assignment, analyses were inverse probability weighted. Results Among the 93 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 54 patients (58.1%) were grouped as the antiplatelet group (AG), and the remaining 39 patients (41.9%) as the non-antiplatelet group (NAG). After inverse propensity weighting, all baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups, and antiplatelet treatment did not show any significant effect on the total WMH volume change (p = 0.957). Conclusion Antiplatelet medication may not alter the progression of WMH."
https://openalex.org/W2605443464,"Living conditions in Nazi concentration camps were harsh and inhumane, leading many prisoners to commit suicide. Sachsenhausen (Oranienburg, Germany) was a concentration camp that operated from 1936 to 1945. More than 200,000 people were detained there under Nazi rule. This study analyzes deaths classified as suicides by inmates in this camp, classified as homosexuals, both according to the surviving Nazi files. This collective was especially repressed by the Nazi authorities. Data was collected from the archives of Sachsenhausen Memorial and the International Tracing Service in Bad Arolsen. Original death certificates and autopsy reports were reviewed. Until the end of World War II, there are 14 death certificates which state ""suicide"" as cause of death of prisoners classified as homosexuals, all of them men aged between 23 and 59 years and of various religions and social strata. Based on a population of 1,200 prisoners classified as homosexuals, this allows us to calculate a suicide rate of 1,167/100,000 (over the period of eight years) for this population, a rate 10 times higher than for global inmates (111/100,000). However, our study has several limitations: not all suicides are registered; some murders were covered-up as suicides; most documents were lost during the war or destroyed by the Nazis when leaving the camps and not much data is available from other camps to compare. We conclude that committing suicides in Sachsenhausen was a common practice, although accurate data may be impossible to obtain."

TTG has notable advantages over existing approaches, which have been largely descriptive, potentially confounded, and non-comparable across contexts. In Study 1, using data from the UK's Millennium Cohort Study, we investigate the different levels of RAE bias across school-level academic subjects and ""personality"" traits.

Based on a multi-regional input-output model, we calculated EEPT for China’s 30 provinces in 2002, 2007 and 2010, and we attempted to determine the drivers of EEPT. The results showed that, during this period, the ratio of EEPT to production-based emissions increased over time, reaching 40.24% in 2010. In consideration of its important role in carbon emissions, we analyzed the factors attributable to EEPT through structure decomposition analysis. The decomposition results showed that final demand and carbon emission intensity were two major factors in EEPT, while the final demand in other provinces and the carbon emission intensity in the local province were major factors for Emissions embodied in provincial exports and the final demand in the local province and the carbon emission intensity in other provinces were major factors for Emissions embodied in provincial imports. Regarding the differences among the EEPT of different provinces, changes in the structure of trade were the primary reason."

The 7,227-bp long genome of HPV204 exhibits typical genomic organization of Mu-PVs with eight open reading frames (ORFs) (E6, E7, E1, E2, E8, E4, L2, and L1). We developed three type-specific quantitative real-time PCRs and used them to test a representative collection (n = 1,006) of various HPV-associated benign and malignant neoplasms, as well as samples of clinically normal cutaneous, mucosal, and mucocutaneous origins. HPV204, HPV1, and HPV63 were detected in 1.1%, 2.7%, and 1.9% of samples tested, respectively, and were present in skin and mucosa, suggesting dual tissue tropism of all Mu-PVs. To evaluate the etiological role of Mu-PVs in the development of HPV-associated neoplasms, Mu-PV viral loads per single cell were estimated. HPV1 and HPV63 were present in high viral copy numbers in 3/43 and 1/43 cutaneous warts, respectively, and were identified as the most likely causative agents of these warts. HPV204 viral load was extremely low in a single HPV204-positive cutaneous wart (7.4 × 10-7 viral copies/cell). Hence, etiological association between HPV204 and the development of cutaneous warts could not be established. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the genetic variability of Mu-PVs by sequencing complete LCR genomic regions of HPV204, HPV1, and HPV63. We detected several nucleotide substitutions and deletions within the LCR genomic regions of Mu-PVs and identified two genetic variants of HPV204 and HPV63 and five genetic variants of HPV1."
https://openalex.org/W2606634101,"The oxidative homeostasis is the balance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidant molecules. In addition to be considered as a key factor underlying life-history traits evolution, the oxidative homeostasis has been shown to be involved in many host–symbiont associations. Previous studies suggest an interaction between the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia and the oxidative homeostasis of some insect hosts. This interaction is likely to exert a strong influence on the host evolution, as it has been proposed in the wasp Asobara tabida, whose dependence upon Wolbachia is due to the evolutionary loss of its ability to regulate the oxidative homeostasis in the absence of the symbiont. Although such cases of complete dependence are rare, cases of insects having lost only a part of their autonomy over the control of the oxidative homeostasis might be more common. If so, one can expect that insects having coevolved with Wolbachia will be more sensitive to oxidative stress when cured of their symbionts. We tested this hypothesis by studying the effects of an experimentally-induced oxidative stress on various life-history traits of Asobara japonica, a species closely related to A. tabida. For most of the life-history traits studied, the sensitivity of the wasps to oxidative stress did not correlate with their infection status. The only exception was the parasitic success. However, contrarily to our expectation, the sensitivity to oxidative stress was increased, rather than decreased, when Wolbachia was present. This result suggests that Wolbachia does not participate to mitigate oxidative stress in A. japonica, and that on the contrary its presence might still be costly in stressful environments."
https://openalex.org/W2606985474,"Using migration data of a rating agency, this paper attempts to quantify the impact of macroeconomic conditions on credit-rating migrations. The migrations are modeled as a coupled Markov chain, where the macroeconomic factors are represented by unobserved tendency variables. In the simplest case, these binary random variables are static and credit-class-specific. A generalization treats tendency variables evolving as a time-homogeneous Markov chain. A more detailed analysis assumes a tendency variable for every combination of a credit class and an industry. The models are tested on a Standard and Poor's (S&P's) dataset. Parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood method. According to the estimates, the investment-grade financial institutions evolve independently of the rest of the economy represented by the data. This might be an evidence of implicit too-big-to-fail bail-out guarantee policies of the regulatory authorities."
https://openalex.org/W2605434197,"Bradavidin is a tetrameric biotin-binding protein similar to chicken avidin and bacterial streptavidin, and was originally cloned from the nitrogen-fixing bacteria Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens. We have previously reported the crystal structure of the full-length, wild-type (wt) bradavidin with 138 amino acids, where the C-terminal residues Gly129-Lys138 (“Brad-tag”) act as an intrinsic ligand (i.e. Gly129-Lys138 bind into the biotin-binding site of an adjacent subunit within the same tetramer) and has potential as an affinity tag for biotechnological purposes. Here, the X-ray structure of core-bradavidin lacking the C-terminal residues Gly114-Lys138, and hence missing the Brad-tag, was crystallized in complex with biotin at 1.60 Å resolution [PDB:4BBO]. We also report a homology model of rhodavidin, an avidin-like protein from Rhodopseudomonas palustris, and of an avidin-like protein from Bradyrhizobium sp. Ai1a-2, both of which have the Brad-tag sequence at their C-terminus. Moreover, core-bradavidin V1, an engineered variant of the original core-bradavidin, was also expressed at high levels in E. coli, as well as a double mutant (Cys39Ala and Cys69Ala) of core-bradavidin (CC mutant). Our data help us to further engineer the core-bradavidin–Brad-tag pair for biotechnological assays and chemical biology applications, and provide deeper insight into the biotin-binding mode of bradavidin."
https://openalex.org/W2607384858,"During an insect sampling program in alfalfa crops near Montpellier, France in 2011, Lacanobia oleracea larvae were collected that died due to nucleopolyhedrovirus infection (LaolNPV). This virus was subjected to molecular and biological characterization. The virus was a multiple nucleocapsid NPV that showed similar restriction profiles to Mamestra configurata NPV-A (MacoNPV-A) but with significant differences. Polypeptide analysis demonstrated similar proteins in occlusion bodies and occlusion derived virions, to those observed in NPVs from Mamestra spp. Terminal sequencing revealed that the genome organization shared similarity with that of MacoNPV-A. The most homologous virus was MacoNPV-A 90/2 isolate (95.63% identity and 96.47% similarity), followed by MacoNPV-A 90/4 strain (95.37% and 96.26%), MacoNPV-B (89.21% and 93.53%) and M. brassicae MNPV (89.42% and 93.74%). Phylogenetic analysis performed with lef-8, lef-9, polh and a concatenated set of genes showed that LaolNPV and the Mamestra spp. NPVs clustered together with HaMNPV, but with a closer genetic distance to MacoNPV-A strains. The Kimura 2-parameter (K-2-P) distances of the complete genes were greater than 0.05 between LaolNPV and the MbMNPV/MacoNPV-B/HaMNPV complex, which indicates that LaolNPV is a distinct species. K-2-P distances were in the range 0.015–0.050 for comparisons of LaolNPV with MacoNPV-A strains, such that additional biological characteristics should be evaluated to determine species status. While MacoNPV-A was pathogenic to seven lepidopteran species tested, LaolNPV was only pathogenic to Chrysodeixis chalcites. Given these findings, Lacanobia oleracea nucleopolyhedrovirus should be considered as a new species in the Alphabaculovirus genus."
