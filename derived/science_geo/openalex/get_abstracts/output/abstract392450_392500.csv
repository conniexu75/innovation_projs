https://openalex.org/W2109948920,"Cancer is driven by somatically acquired point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, conventionally thought to accumulate gradually over time. Using next-generation sequencing, we characterize a phenomenon, which we term chromothripsis, whereby tens to hundreds of genomic rearrangements occur in a one-off cellular crisis. Rearrangements involving one or a few chromosomes crisscross back and forth across involved regions, generating frequent oscillations between two copy number states. These genomic hallmarks are highly improbable if rearrangements accumulate over time and instead imply that nearly all occur during a single cellular catastrophe. The stamp of chromothripsis can be seen in at least 2%–3% of all cancers, across many subtypes, and is present in ∼25% of bone cancers. We find that one, or indeed more than one, cancer-causing lesion can emerge out of the genomic crisis. This phenomenon has important implications for the origins of genomic remodeling and temporal emergence of cancer.PaperClip/cms/asset/11160b8f-e385-4dd3-bf95-502960456925/mmc8.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 2.86 MB) Download audio"
https://openalex.org/W2044247101,"Inland waters (lakes, reservoirs, streams, and rivers) are often substantial methane (CH(4)) sources in the terrestrial landscape. They are, however, not yet well integrated in global greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets. Data from 474 freshwater ecosystems and the most recent global water area estimates indicate that freshwaters emit at least 103 teragrams of CH(4) year(-1), corresponding to 0.65 petagrams of C as carbon dioxide (CO(2)) equivalents year(-1), offsetting 25% of the estimated land carbon sink. Thus, the continental GHG sink may be considerably overestimated, and freshwaters need to be recognized as important in the global carbon cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2023402149,"The life span of C. elegans can be increased via reduced function of the mitochondria; however, the extent to which mitochondrial alteration in a single, distinct tissue may influence aging in the whole organism remains unknown. We addressed this question by asking whether manipulations to ETC function can modulate aging in a cell-non-autonomous fashion. We report that the alteration of mitochondrial function in key tissues is essential for establishing and maintaining a prolongevity cue. We find that regulators of mitochondrial stress responses are essential and specific genetic requirements for the electron transport chain (ETC) longevity pathway. Strikingly, we find that mitochondrial perturbation in one tissue is perceived and acted upon by the mitochondrial stress response pathway in a distal tissue. These results suggest that mitochondria may establish and perpetuate the rate of aging for the whole organism independent of cell-autonomous functions."

Designed β sheet proteins form amyloid-like aggregates and are toxic in human cells The aggregates sequester numerous preexistent and newly synthesized proteins The affected proteins are enriched in disordered regions and are multifunctional Protein coaggregation may contribute to toxicity in neurodegenerative diseases. The majority of proteins must fold into well-defined three-dimensional structures in order to fulfill their biological functions. This fundamental process is aided by a complex cellular machinery of molecular chaperones, which act to prevent misfolding and aggregation (Frydman, 2001Frydman J.

Failure of a protein to fold properly, or to retain its folded state, has emerged as the cause of numerous diseases. Aberrant folding is often the result of destabilizing mutations and may cause the loss of critical functions. However, in a growing number of diseases, misfolding and aggregation results predominantly in a toxic gain of function (Stefani and Dobson, 2003Stefani M. Dobson C.M.

In these disorders, specific proteins, differing substantially in size and sequence, typically self-assemble into amyloid-like fibrils with cross-β structure which are deposited within or outside of cells. This phenomenon underlies some of the most debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's disease. Amyloidogenic aggregation is observed with many protein sequences (Chiti and Dobson, 2006Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Protein misfolding, functional amyloid, and human disease.Annu. Rev.

Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 469: 100-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanisms are only poorly understood but a prominent hypothesis suggests that the aggregates, in particular the more heterogeneous oligomers, may expose flexible hydrophobic surfaces that can mediate aberrant interactions with other proteins, resulting in their functional impairment and sequestration (Bolognesi et al., 2010Bolognesi B. Kumita J.R. Barros T.P. Esbjorner E.K. Luheshi L.M. Crowther D.C. Wilson M.R. Dobson C.M. Favrin G. Yerbury J.J. ANS Binding Reveals Common Features of Cytotoxic Amyloid Species.ACS Chem.

Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (4757) Google Scholar). In another model, misfolding proteins, by engaging the chaperone machinery, are thought to interfere with central protein quality control and clearance mechanisms, possibly resulting in a propagation of folding defects (Balch et al., 2008Balch W.E.

Finally, based on experiments with model membranes, oligomeric aggregation intermediates can compromise the integrity of lipid membranes (Lashuel and Lansbury, 2006Lashuel H.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Are amyloid diseases caused by protein aggregates that mimic bacterial pore-forming toxins?.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2006; 39: 167-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Importantly, these different routes of toxic action are not mutually exclusive but may operate in parallel. To investigate the toxicity mechanisms of amyloid-like aggregation, we have established a cellular model based on the expression of artificial proteins that were designed to form β sheet structures, and shown previously to self-assemble into fibrils in vitro (West et al., 1999West M.W. Wang W.X. Patterson J. Mancias J.D. Beasley J.R. Hecht M.H. De novo amyloid proteins from designed combinatorial libraries.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The sequences of these proteins were explicitly designed to contain β strands with an alternating pattern of polar and nonpolar residues, while the exact identities of the side chains were varied combinatorially. Similar bipolar segments occur in ∼30% of human proteins, including several neurodegenerative disease proteins, but are usually buried within the folded structure (Tartaglia et al., 2008Tartaglia G.G. Pawar A.P. Campioni S. Dobson C.M. Chiti F. Vendruscolo M. Prediction of aggregation-prone regions in structured proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Because the model proteins were designed de novo, they are not biased by the evolutionary burden of natural proteins and thus allowed us to study the gain-of-function toxicity caused by aggregation without interference either from loss-of-function alterations or from an augmentation of the biological activities of natural disease proteins (Cooper et al., 2006Cooper A.A. Gitler A.D. Cashikar A. Haynes C.M. Hill K.J. Bhullar B. Liu K.N. Xu K.X. Strathearn K.E.

Here, we tested specifically the hypothesis that the aggregates engage in widespread aberrant protein interactions. We found that expression of the model proteins in human cells results in aggregate formation and toxicity. Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals that the aggregates interact with and sequester multiple preexistent and newly synthesized proteins. Interestingly, these interactions can be explained in terms of specific sequence features of the coaggregating proteins, such as their multidomain character and their enrichment in disordered regions, properties that are strongly linked with multifunctionality and the occupancy of hub positions in the cellular protein network. We suggest that aberrant interactions with numerous proteins having key cellular functions contribute to aggregate toxicity. To investigate the gain-of-function cytotoxicity associated with amyloid-like aggregation, we used several model polypeptides from a combinatorial library rationally designed to form cross-β fibrils (West et al., 1999West M.W. Wang W.X. Patterson J. Mancias J.D. Beasley J.R. Hecht M.H. De novo amyloid proteins from designed combinatorial libraries.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These proteins, henceforth designated as β proteins, contain six β strands connected by 4-amino acid linker segments, with each strand comprising seven amino acids in a polar-nonpolar alternating pattern. An N-terminal c-Myc-epitope was attached to facilitate detection (Figure 1A ). The three proteins chosen for analysis, β4, β17, and β23, differ in sequence (pairwise identities of β strands ∼35%), with β23 having the highest hydrophobic volume and β sheet propensity, due to its higher isoleucine content (Figure 1A) (Tartaglia et al., 2008Tartaglia G.G. Pawar A.P. Campioni S. Dobson C.M. Chiti F. Vendruscolo M. Prediction of aggregation-prone regions in structured proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). As a control, we used the designed α-helical protein, α-S824, which is similar to the β proteins in amino acid composition but folds into a 4-helix bundle structure (Wei et al., 2003Wei Y.N. Liu T. Sazinsky S.L. Moffet D.A. Pelczer I. Hecht M.H. Stably folded de novo proteins from a designed combinatorial library.Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). Upon dilution from denaturant into physiological buffer, the purified β proteins adopted β sheet conformation as determined by CD and rapidly assembled into aggregates detectable with the amyloid-binding dyes thioflavin T (ThT) and NIAD-4 (Nesterov et al., 2005Nesterov E.E. Skoch J. Hyman B.T. Klunk W.E. Bacskai B.J. Swager T.M. In vivo optical imaging of amyloid aggregates in brain: design of fluorescent markers.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2005; 44: 5452-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) (Figures 1B, 1C, and Figures S1A and S1B available online). The intensity of ThT and NIAD-4 binding was highest for β23, followed by β17 and β4 (Figures 1B and 1C), consistent with the relative β aggregation propensity of these proteins calculated with the sequence-based Zagg method (Tartaglia et al., 2008Tartaglia G.G. Pawar A.P. Campioni S. Dobson C.M. Chiti F. Vendruscolo M. Prediction of aggregation-prone regions in structured proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) (Zagg scores are: β4, 0.79; β17, 0.83; β23, 0.93; α-S824, and 0.30). ANS fluorescence, a probe for exposed hydrophobic regions, suggested the presence of hydrophobic surfaces on the aggregates, in particular for β23 and β17 (Figure 1D). As shown via electron microscopy, the β proteins formed mostly relatively short protofilaments (∼2–3 nm in diameter) as well as more heterogeneous, globular aggregates (Figure 1E). Formation of globular species was most pronounced with β23 (Figure 1E). Similar prefibrillar aggregates are also observed with natural amyloidogenic proteins and correlate with cytotoxicity (Bolognesi et al., 2010Bolognesi B. Kumita J.R. Barros T.P. Esbjorner E.K. Luheshi L.M. Crowther D.C. Wilson M.R. Dobson C.M. Favrin G. Yerbury J.J. ANS Binding Reveals Common Features of Cytotoxic Amyloid Species.ACS Chem. Biol. 2010; 5: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, Campioni et al., 2010Campioni S. Mannini B. Zampagni M. Pensalfini A. Parrini C. Evangelisti E. Relini A. Stefani M. Dobson C.M.

Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (4757) Google Scholar). In contrast, in low-salt buffer (pH 6), the β proteins formed thicker (10–12 nm diameter) and longer fibrils (Figure 1F) with FTIR spectroscopic properties characteristic of amyloid (Figure S1C). Thus, the model proteins undergo amyloid-like aggregation in vitro, and in physiological buffer populate prefibrillar species. Upon expression in HEK293T cells for 3 days, the β proteins, but not α-S824, reduced cell viability substantially, as measured by the MTT assay (Figure 2A ), and induced cell death in the order β23 > β17 > β4 (Figures S2A and S2B ). Cell viability was less impaired after 24 hr of expression, without a significant difference in toxicity between the three β proteins (Figure 2A). Upon cell fractionation, the β proteins were largely recovered in the insoluble fraction, whereas α-S824 was soluble (Figure 2B). Note that β4 and β17 migrated on SDS-PAGE more slowly than expected, but this difference was not observed in urea/SDS gels (Figure S1A). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-Myc antibody showed that the β-protein-expressing cells adopted a collapsed shape lacking filopodia (Figure 2C). Aggregates accumulated mostly in the perinuclear space and the nuclei were often deformed. The aggregates were NIAD-4 positive (Figure 2D), suggesting the presence of amyloid-like material. To detect oligomeric aggregation intermediates, cell extracts were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography followed by dot blot analysis with the A11 antibody, which was raised against the Alzheimer Aβ peptide and preferentially recognizes amyloid oligomers associated with cytotoxicity, independent of amino acid sequence (Kayed et al., 2003Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Common structure of soluble amyloid oligomers implies common mechanism of pathogenesis.Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3282) Google Scholar). β23 expression generated substantially higher levels of A11 reactive material than expression of β4 and β17 (Figure 2E and Figure S2C), consistent with the greater toxicity of β23 and its pronounced tendency to form prefibrillar aggregates in vitro (Figures 1E and 1F).Figure S2Cellular Effects of β Protein Expression in HEK293T Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) β Protein expression induces cell death.

A quantification of these results is shown in Figure 2E. In summary, the designed β proteins resemble amyloidogenic disease proteins in terms of aggregation properties and toxicity and allow us to investigate the mechanism of gain-of-function toxicity independently from evolved biological interactions. Gain-of-function toxicity of aggregation may arise, at least in part, from aberrant interactions of the aggregates with cellular proteins. To test this hypothesis, we performed a sensitive, quantitative proteomic analysis of the β protein interactome using SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) (Ong and Mann, 2006Ong S.E. Mann M. A practical recipe for stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC).Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2650-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) and peptide identification by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). These experiments were performed at 24 hr after β protein transfection when cell viability was not yet severely impaired (Figure 2A). In one set of experiments, cells labeled with light (L), medium (M) or heavy (H) arginine and lysine isotopes were transfected with empty vector, α-S824 and β23, respectively. In another set-up, α-S824, β4, and β17 were expressed in L-, M-, and H-labeled cells, respectively (Figure 3A ). Preferential interactions with β4, β17, or β23 were explored in a third type of experiment. Total cell lysates were prepared essentially without removal of aggregate material and combined 1:1:1 (Figure 3A and Figure S3A). The expressed proteins were quantitatively isolated using anti-Myc antibody coupled to magnetic beads, followed by SDS-PAGE, in-gel digestion, and LC-MS/MS analysis. It seemed plausible that initial coaggregation may be driven by relatively weak interactions, which might introduce a stochastic element in the proteomic analysis. To overcome this problem we based our analysis on extensive biological repetitions of the experiments. Three proteomic experiments were performed, each consisting of three biological repeats (independent transfections). A protein was identified as β protein interactor when its isotope-labeled peptides were either enriched relative to the α-S824 control or relative to one of the other β proteins with > 95% confidence in at least two of the three repeats of a set (see Extended Experimental Procedures and Figures S3B–S3D). A total of 94 interactors of β23, 73, of β17 and 57 of β4 were identified in experiments of equivalent sampling size, consistent with the relative toxicity of the proteins (Figure 3B and Tables S1–S3). Only four proteins were marginally enriched on α-S824 relative to the vector only control, including two ribosomal proteins (Figure S3B ). Approximately 60% of the β4 and β17 interactors were also found to interact with β23, indicating a high degree of overlap in interaction profiles (Figure 3B). Western blotting of pulldowns and immunofluorescence analysis of cells confirmed the results from SILAC/MS for several interactors (Figures S3E and S3F). Thus, interactions of the β protein aggregates with multiple endogenous proteins precede the strong decrease in cell viability observed at 72 hr after transfection (Figure 2A). As summarized for β23, most of the proteins associated with the aggregates have their primary location in the cytoplasm, nucleus and mitochondria (Figure 3C and Table S1). Proteins involved in chromatin regulation, RNA processing, transcription, translation, cytoskeletal function, vesicle transport, and protein quality control were highly represented. These proteins are generally of average cellular abundance (Su et al., 2002Su A.I. Cooke M.P. Ching K.A. Hakak Y. Walker J.R. Wiltshire T. Orth A.P. Vega R.G. Sapinoso L.M. Moqrich A. et al.Large-scale analysis of the human and mouse transcriptomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 4465-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar) and for several of them between 10% and 45% of total was associated with the aggregates, based on depletion from supernatant fractions after pulldown as measured by SILAC/MS (Table S1 and Extended Experimental Procedures). Note that this analysis probably underestimates the extent of sequestration, since coaggregates may partially dissociate during isolation. Interestingly, 12 different translation initiation factors interacted directly or indirectly with the aggregates, including 9 of the 13 subunits of the eIF3 complex and 3 subunits of eIF4 (Figure 3C). β17 aggregates contained 10 and β4 aggregates 9 of these proteins (Tables S2 and S3). Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated extensive colocalization of eIF3D and eIF4GII with the aggregates and western blotting of pulldowns confirmed that at least ∼10% of cellular eIF3D coaggregated with β23 and β17, compared to ∼6% with β4 (Figures S3E and S3F, and data not shown). Indeed, labeling experiments showed that cells expressing β23 for 24 hr had a ∼35% reduced protein synthesis capacity (Figure S3G). Similarly, the altered morphology of β-protein-expressing cells revealed by actin staining (Figure S3H) may be attributed to the association of filamins A, B, C, (FLNA, FLNB, FLNC), and the giant protein plectin-1 (PLEC1) (∼500 kDa) with the aggregates (Figure 3C), proteins that are critical for the formation and maintenance of cytoskeletal architecture. These results show that many different proteins, involved in a range of essential cellular functions, are affected by the β protein aggregates. The proteomic analysis identified several cytosolic chaperones and chaperone regulators to be associated with the aggregates, including Hsc70 (Hsc71) and its cochaperones Hsp110 (Hsp105), Hdj1/2 and Bag2, as well as the nascent chain associated complex, NAC (Figure 3C). Hsp110 was enriched in the aggregates in a manner correlating with the relative toxicity of β4, β17 and β23, as confirmed by western blotting and immunofluorescence (Figures 4A and 4B ). Indeed, overexpression of Hsp110 (Figure S4A ) partially suppressed β4 and β17 aggregation and toxicity but was inefficient in mitigating the toxic effects of β23 (Figures 4C and Figures S4B and S4C).Figure S4Hsp110 Expression in β-Protein-Expressing Cells, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Levels of overexpression of Hsp110 in HEK293T cells detected by immunoblotting. Cells were transfected with human Hsp110 expression plasmid using Lipofectamine. 24 hr later they were transfected with 30 μg of the β protein expression plasmids or empty control vector by electroporation. Three days later, cells were lysed and Hsp110 expression levels determined by immunoblotting with anti-Hsp110 antibody. GAPDH was detected with anti-GAPDH antibody as a loading control.(B and C) Changes in cell morphology and β protein solubility upon overexpression of Hsp110. Transfection of Hsp110 and β proteins was performed as in (A), except that 5 μg DNA was used for β protein expression. 24 hr hours later, cell morphology and aggregation of the model proteins were evaluated by confocal microscopy using anti-Myc and anti-Hsp110 immunostaining.

https://openalex.org/W2029130862,"Here, we exploit the hair follicle to define the point at which stem cells (SCs) become irreversibly committed along a differentiation lineage. Employing histone and nucleotide double-pulse-chase and lineage tracing, we show that the early SC descendents en route to becoming transit-amplifying cells retain stemness and slow-cycling properties and home back to the bulge niche when hair growth stops. These become the primary SCs for the next hair cycle, whereas initial bulge SCs become reserves for injury. Proliferating descendents further en route irreversibly lose their stemness, although they retain many SC markers and survive, unlike their transit-amplifying progeny. Remarkably, these progeny also home back to the bulge. Combining purification and gene expression analysis with differential ablation and functional experiments, we define critical functions for these non-SC niche residents and unveil the intriguing concept that an irreversibly committed cell in an SC lineage can become an essential contributor to the niche microenvironment."

https://openalex.org/W2012861249,"Mitochondria import a large number of nuclear-encoded proteins via membrane-bound transport machineries; however, little is known about regulation of the preprotein translocases. We report that the main protein entry gate of mitochondria, the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM complex), is phosphorylated by cytosolic kinases—in particular, casein kinase 2 (CK2) and protein kinase A (PKA). CK2 promotes biogenesis of the TOM complex by phosphorylation of two key components, the receptor Tom22 and the import protein Mim1, which in turn are required for import of further Tom proteins. Inactivation of CK2 decreases the levels of the TOM complex and thus mitochondrial protein import. PKA phosphorylates Tom70 under nonrespiring conditions, thereby inhibiting its receptor activity and the import of mitochondrial metabolite carriers. We conclude that cytosolic kinases exert stimulatory and inhibitory effects on biogenesis and function of the TOM complex and thus regulate protein import into mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2112660358,"The adaptive immune system is thought to be a rich source of protein biomarkers, but diagnostically useful antibodies remain unknown for a large number of diseases. This is, in part, because the antigens that trigger an immune response in many diseases remain unknown. We present here a general and unbiased approach to the identification of diagnostically useful antibodies that avoids the requirement for antigen identification. This method involves the comparative screening of combinatorial libraries of unnatural, synthetic molecules against serum samples obtained from cases and controls. Molecules that retain far more IgG antibodies from the case samples than the controls are identified and subsequently tested as capture agents for diagnostically useful antibodies. The utility of this method is demonstrated using a mouse model for multiple sclerosis and via the identification of two candidate IgG biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease."

Aβ aggregation is the key pathogenic event in Alzheimer disease, where Aβ oligomers are the major culprits. The fundamental mechanism of these metal ions on Aβ remains elusive. Here, we employ 4,4′-Bis(1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonate) and tyrosine fluorescence, CD, stopped flow fluorescence, guanidine hydrochloride denaturation, and photo-induced cross-linking to elucidate the effect of Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, and Al3+ on Aβ at the early stage of the aggregation. Furthermore, thioflavin T assay, dot blotting, and transmission electron microscopy are utilized to examine Aβ aggregation. Our results show that Al3+ and Zn2+, but not Cu2+ and Fe3+, induce larger hydrophobic exposures of Aβ conformation, resulting in its significant destabilization at the early stage. The metal ion binding induces Aβ conformational changes with micromolar binding affinities and millisecond binding kinetics. Cu2+ and Zn2+ induce similar assembly of transiently appearing Aβ oligomers at the early state. During the aggregation, we found that Zn2+ exclusively promotes the annular protofibril formation without undergoing a nucleation process, whereas Cu2+ and Fe3+ inhibit fibril formation by prolonging the nucleation phases. Al3+ also inhibits fibril formation; however, the annular oligomers co-exist in the aggregation pathway.

The involvement of the metal ions with Aβ in AD and the potential development of metal chelating therapy indicate the importance of elucidating fundamental mechanisms of their effect on Aβ. Here, we systematically examine the metal ion effects, especially of Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, and Al3+, on early and aggregated stages of full-length Aβ40. By employing different spectroscopic methods, including far-UV CD, tyrosine fluorescence, and 4,4′-Bis(1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonate) (Bis-ANS) fluorescence, we monitor the conformational changes of Aβ and its ion binding affinity at the early stage. The binding kinetics and conformational stability are further examined by stopped flow machinery and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation. Photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP), thioflavin T (ThT) assay, dot blotting, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are also employed to monitor the oligomerization and fibrillization during aggregation. A mechanism for the metal ion effects on Aβ stability, oligomerization, and aggregation is then proposed.

Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass was identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (UltraFlex II; Bruker BioSciences, Billerica, MA). To prepare the Aβ stock, lyophilized peptide was freshly dissolved in Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 8 m GdnHCl and refolded into Buffer A at a concentration of ∼1 mg/ml. Then the stock was then centrifuged at 17,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and quantified by absorbance at 280 nm (ϵ = 1,280 cm−1 m−1) (55Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar) and used as a stock solution to prepare Aβ at 25 μm for all experiments. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained using a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon). The emission spectra of Bis-ANS at 5 μm were collected from 450 to 550 nm with excitation at 400 nm. The emission spectra of tyrosine were collected from 290 to 360 nm with excitation at 270 nm. Both fluorescent experiments were performed at 25 °C. Temperature was controlled by a circulating water bath. The buffer backgrounds were subtracted. Far-UV CD spectra were collected from 250 to 202 nm at 25 °C using a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD). A circular quartz cell with a path length of 1 mm was used. Six scans were performed and averaged for each condition. The 25 μm Aβ solution was titrated with different metal ion stock solutions: ZnCl2, CuCl2, and FeCl3 at 2 mm or AlCl3 at 20 mm. Less than 10% of the solution volume was increased after titration. Three different signals were collected, and the dilution factor was corrected. The monitored signals were 490 nm for Bis-ANS fluorescence, 305 nm for tyrosine fluorescence, and 216 nm for CD. The final titration signal was used as unity for normalization. The normalized data were plotted against the metal ion concentration. The amount of aluminum atom in the solution was confirmed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Data fitting was performed by using an equation describing single protein ligand binding (56Chen Y.R. Clark A.C. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar),P+L↔PLr=(2Pt)−1*[(Kd+Lt+Pt)−((Kd+Lt+Pt)2−4PtLt)1/2](Eq.1) where γ is the fraction of the observed signal changes representing the bound protein fraction, Pt is the total Aβ concentration, Lt is the total ligand concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant. In addition, the data were fitted to an equation describing one-protein and two-ligand binding,P+L↔K1PLPL+L↔K2PL2r=(K1L+K1K2L2)/(1+K1L+K1K2L2)(Eq.2) where γ is the fraction of the observed signal change, K1 and K2 are the association constants for the first and second ligand binding, and L is the free ligand concentration. Because the free ligand concentration cannot be faithfully determined in our experimental conditions, we used the total ligand concentration as L for the fitting. The kinetics of Aβ and metal ion binding was examined using a stopped flow module (Bio-Logic, Claix, France) attached to a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter. The stopped flow module was composed of a multimixer SFM-400, a motor power supply MPS-250, and a photomultiplier system PMS-250. A fluorescence cuvette, FC-15, with an optical path of 1.5 mm was used. Excitation at 270 nm was used to monitor the tyrosine fluorescence of Aβ at 12.5 μm. A single mixing reaction using a volume ratio of 9:1 for the metal ions and Aβ was performed at 25 °C. The final metal ion concentrations were 1.25 mm; hence the metal-to-Aβ ratio was 100 to 1. Here, Aβ was prepared in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to avoid metal ion-induced acidity. In this buffer system, the reactions were in neutral pH. The flow rate was fixed at 11 ml/s, resulting in a dead time of 4.7 ms. The data were collected every 0.5 ms for the first 2 s, every 20 ms in the range of 2–60 s, and every 0.5 s for 60–100 s. The data were fitted to multi-exponential equations using Bio-kine 32 V4.51 (Bio-Logic, Claix, France) with either single or double exponential equations with a linear base line,Y=ax+b+c1exp−k1t(Eq.3) Y=ax+b+c1exp−k1t+c2exp−k2t(Eq.4) where a and b are the slope and offset for the linear base line, and c and k are the amplitudes and rate constants for the exponential phases, respectively. The denaturation study was performed, as described previously (58Chen Y.R. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24414-24422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), at 25 °C. Briefly, the titration was performed by titrating an unfolded Aβ solution in Buffer A containing ∼6.2 m GdnHCl into Aβ solution in Buffer A containing <0.1 m GdnHCl. The desired metal ion concentrations, 25 μm of Aβ, and 5 μm of Bis-ANS were present in both solutions. The duration for each titration was ∼30 s, and each set of denaturation experiment was less than 1 h. The Bis-ANS fluorescence emission at 490 nm was collected, averaged, and normalized. The normalized emission intensity versus GdnHCl concentration was plotted. The experiment was performed as described previously (59Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Here, we prepared the Aβ stock by urea instead of GdnHCl to facilitate running of SDS-PAGE. Briefly, Aβ samples at 25 μm prepared in Buffer A with different ion concentrations, as indicated, were immediately subjected to photo-induced cross-linking. A 90% Aβ solution was mixed with 5% each of 1 mm Tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) and 20 mm ammonium persulfate. After mixing, the samples were exposed to a blue light LED in a closed chamber with a manual switch for 10 s. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding the SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were run on Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. All of the actions were performed without delay. The gel was subjected to Western blotting with anti-Aβ antibody 6E10 (Chemicon Inc., Billerica, MA) recognizing Aβ residues 1–17. Aβ (25 μm) in Buffer A with different metal ion concentrations and 25 μm ThT were incubated in an ELISA plate and monitored by a microplate reader (SpectraMax M5; Molecule Devices) at 25 °C. The samples were in quiescence during the incubation, except for 10 s of mixing prior to the measurement. The ThT emission was measured at 485 nm, whereas excitation was at 442 nm. The signals were collected automatically every 1 h for the first 100 h, after which they were collected in a longer intervals. To detect the oligomers during the aggregation, 2 μl of the samples from the ThT assay were dotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane at the indicated incubation time and recognized using an anti-Aβ oligomer antibody, A11 (Invitrogen). The samples were placed on glow-discharged, 400-mesh Formvar carbon-coated copper grids (EMS Inc., Hatfield, PA) for 3 min, rinsed, and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. The samples were examined with a Tecnai G2 Spirit TWIN TEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) with an accelerating voltage of 75 kV. The aggregated products of 25 μm Zn2+ or 100 μm Al3+ and 25 μm Aβ were incubated in Buffer A and subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant and pellet were collected and analyzed by dot blotting using A11 and 6E10 antibodies and TEM. The pellet was resuspended in the original volume of Buffer A. To reveal the effect of metal ions on Aβ, the ion-induced Aβ structural changes were monitored by three spectroscopic techniques: Bis-ANS fluorescence, tyrosine fluorescence, and far-UV CD spectra (Fig. 1). Bis-ANS is able to report the hydrophobic clusters exposed on protein surfaces and to probe Aβ conformation at the early stage, where the binding sites are at the flanking regions of the protease-resistant segment of Aβ (58Chen Y.R. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24414-24422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 60Brand L. Gohlke J.R. Annu. Rev.

The experiments were performed with Aβ at 25 μm in the presence of Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, and Al3+ above their saturated concentrations, as determined by the metal ion binding experiment described below. The Aβ spectra with and without 200 μm of Zn2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+ and 500 μm of Al3+ are shown in Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1. In the presence of Al3+ and Zn2+, the Bis-ANS emission of Aβ40 showed ∼30- and 15-fold enhancement, respectively, but decreased ∼2.5-fold in the presence of Cu2+. The enhancement of the emission intensity indicates a larger extent of hydrophobic clusters exposed on the protein surface. Fe3+ did not induce significant changes on the hydrophobic surfaces of Aβ. Apart from the intensity difference, all of the spectra were blue-shifted from 500 nm to a range of ∼480–495 nm, indicating Bis-ANS encountering the hydrophobic environment. In addition to extrinsic fluorescence, we used intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence at residue 10 of Aβ to report local conformational changes. In the absence of metal ions, the tyrosine emission had a maximum at ∼302 nm while excited at 270 nm. We found that the tyrosine emissions were significantly quenched in the presence of Fe3+ and Cu2+ but enhanced in the presence of Al3+ and Zn2+ (Fig. 1B). The base lines of the spectra moved upward with concentration dependence to Al3+ and Zn2+ but not to Fe3+ and Cu2+ (supplemental Fig. S2). The increase in base line may be due to the formation of other unknown fluorescence species. Furthermore, far-UV CD spectra were employed to examine the secondary structure changes of Aβ (Fig. 1C). In the absence of the metal ions, a random coil-dominant spectrum was observed, as expected (62Riek R. Güntert P. Döbeli H. Wipf B. Wüthrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5930-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, all four metal ions further decreased ellipticity, especially with Zn2+ and Al3+, revealing that the metal ions reduced the content of residual secondary structures existing in Aβ conformation. Together, our results showed that Zn2+ and Al3+ increased the hydrophobic exposed protein surfaces, induced higher tyrosine emission, and reduced most residual secondary structures of Aβ. In contrast, Cu2+ and Fe3+ induced less or did not alter hydrophobic exposed surfaces, decreased tyrosine emission, and reduced residual secondary structures of Aβ. To understand the conformational changes, binding stoichiometry, and affinity of Aβ and the metal ions, titration methods monitored by Bis-ANS fluorescence, tyrosine fluorescence, and far-UV CD were employed (Fig. 2). Aβ solutions at 25 μm were used, and the signals were normalized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fractions of Aβ bound with the metals were plotted against the metal ion to Aβ ratio. In general, the results showed that the three reporting signals changed coordinately but with some degree of differences. In the presence of"

PKCs translocate to cell membranes and are allosterically activated upon binding of the lipid diacylglycerol to their C1A and C1B domains. The crystal structure of full-length protein kinase C βII was determined at 4.0 Å, revealing the conformation of an unexpected intermediate in the activation pathway. Here, the kinase active site is accessible to substrate, yet the conformation of the active site corresponds to a low-activity state because the ATP-binding side chain of Phe629 of the conserved NFD motif is displaced. The C1B domain clamps the NFD helix in a low-activity conformation, which is reversed upon membrane binding. A low-resolution solution structure of the closed conformation of PKCβII was derived from small-angle X-ray scattering.

Many of the most prominent second messengers are lipids, and the paradigmatic lipid second messenger is sn-1,2 diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG activates a variety of cellular effectors, including kinases and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for small G proteins (Yang and Kazanietz, 2003Yang C. Kazanietz M.G. Divergence and complexities in DAG signaling: looking beyond PKC.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 602-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). By far the most widely distributed class of DAG effectors are the protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes (Rosse et al., 2010Rosse C. Linch M. Kermorgant S. Cameron A.J.M. Boeckeler K. Parker P.J. PKC and the control of localized signal dynamics.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Intensively studied for the past three decades, PKCs are the archetypal allosteric transducer of lipid second messenger signaling (Newton, 1995Newton A.C. Protein kinase C: Structure, function, and regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar, Nishizuka, 1992Nishizuka Y. Intracellular signaling by hydrolysis of phospholipids and activation of protein kinase C.Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4226) Google Scholar). In keeping with their widespread tissue distribution, PKCs regulate a remarkable range of physiological pathways, including, but not limited to, T cell recognition, cell polarity, cell migration, proliferation and differentiation, neuronal signaling, and metabolism (Rosse et al., 2010Rosse C. Linch M. Kermorgant S. Cameron A.J.M. Boeckeler K. Parker P.J. PKC and the control of localized signal dynamics.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). PKCs are serine/threonine kinases of the AGC family (Pearce et al., 2010Pearce L.R. Komander D. Alessi D.R. The nuts and bolts of AGC protein kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). The AGC family includes protein kinases A, B, C, D, and G and is characterized by a C-terminal extension of the kinase domain that contains one or two regulatory phosphorylation sites, important for kinase activity (Pearce et al., 2010Pearce L.R. Komander D. Alessi D.R. The nuts and bolts of AGC protein kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Like other kinases, PKCs require phosphorylation of a conserved Ser/Thr in the activation loop for activity (Pearce et al., 2010Pearce L.R. Komander D. Alessi D.R. The nuts and bolts of AGC protein kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). PKCs are grouped into subclasses based on the domain composition of the regulatory portion and their respective cofactor requirements (Hurley and Grobler, 1997Hurley J.H. Grobler J.A.

Protein kinase C: Structure, function, and regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). The conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, γ) are regulated via two DAG-binding C1 domains (Hurley et al., 1997Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Taxonomy and function of C1 protein kinase C homology domains.Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and a Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding C2 domain (Nalefski and Falke, 1996Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. The C2 domain calcium-binding motif: Structural and functional diversity.Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A ). The novel, Ca2+-independent PKCs (δ, ɛ, η, θ) have an N-terminal C2 domain that does not bind Ca2+ or phospholipids, and two typical DAG-binding C1 domains. The Ca2+/DAG-independent atypical isoforms (ζ, λ/ι) have a single atypical C1 domain that does not bind DAG and lack a C2 domain. All PKCs have a pseudosubstrate region, in which the phosphorylatable Ser/Thr is replaced by an Ala, which maintains the inactive state in the absence of an activating signal (Newton, 1995Newton A.C.

Newton A.C. Intrapeptide regulation of protein kinase C.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8383-8387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKCs are primed for activation by the phosphorylation of three residues (Tsutakawa et al., 1995Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J. Burlingame A.L. Koshland D.E. Determination of in vivo phosphorylation sites in protein kinase C.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26807-26812Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). First, the activation loop Ser/Thr is phosphorylated by PDK1 (Chou et al., 1998Chou M.M. Hou W.M. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A.

Ouyang W.M. Wei H. Soto N. Lazorchak A. Gould C. Lowry C. Newton A.C. Mao Y.X.

Primed PKCs are activated to phosphorylate their substrates when their regulatory domains engage the appropriate combination of signals. Signal engagement triggers the release of the pseudosubstrate sequence from the active site, allowing access to substrates. In the case of the conventional PKCs, these signals are DAG, Ca2+, and phospholipids (Hurley and Grobler, 1997Hurley J.H. Grobler J.A.

This information has been difficult to integrate into a high-resolution picture of the activation pathway because of various technical challenges in the crystallization of full-length PKCs. In addition to the usual challenges of crystallization of multidomain proteins, suitable PKC samples for crystallization must be stoichiometrically phosphorylated at the activation loop, turn, and hydrophobic sites. Proteolysis in the highly labile V3 region connecting the regulatory and catalytic domains must be avoided. The Zn2+ ions required for the stability of the C1 domains must be retained. We optimized sample purification according to these criteria and were able to crystallize full-length rat PKCβII, an isozyme that has been the subject of especially intensive mechanistic analysis. Moreover, PKCβII is the target for the investigational diabetes drug ruboxistaurin (Das Evcimen and King, 2007Das Evcimen N. King G.L. The role of protein kinase C activation and the vascular complications of diabetes.Pharmacol. Res. 2007; 55: 498-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Crystals of PKCβII diffracted only to 4.0 Å, but by taking advantage of improved methodology for low-resolution crystallographic refinement, the data proved adequate to map a previously unobserved conformation of a helix encompassing the conserved NFD motif of the AGC kinase family. Unexpectedly, lattice contacts between the C2 and catalytic domains led to the observation of what appeared to be a partially activated conformation. We were able to confirm the structural inference that the observed conformation is part of the physiological activation pathway by mutational analysis of PKCβII translocation. Thus, this structure provides a snapshot of an intermediate in the lipid activation pathway of PKCβII. The analysis identified an unexpected mechanism of allosteric regulation through plasticity of the NFD motif region. In order to fill out the structural picture of the PKCβII activation pathway, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used, in conjunction with constraints provided by the crystal structure, to determine a low-resolution structure of the closed, autoinhibited conformation. Together, these structural analyses allow us to map out a conformational activation pathway that is more complex than anticipated. PKCβII samples were confirmed for integrity with respect to intact primary structure, stoichiometric Zn binding, phorbol ester-dependent membrane binding and kinase activity, phosphorylation at the three canonical sites on the catalytic domain, and monodispersity (Figure S1 available online). Crystals of a maximum dimension of 20 μm were grown, and diffraction data were collected to 4.0 Å (Table 1) on the GM/CA-CAT dedicated microbeam (ID23-B) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the PKCβII kinase domain (Grodsky et al., 2006Grodsky N.

Electron density was visible for the kinase domain, the C2 domain, and a single C1 domain (Figures 1B and 1C; Figure S2A ). The identity and orientation of the C1 domain was confirmed using an anomalous difference Fourier synthesis to locate the two native Zn atoms (Figure S2B). Following refinement, density for the C1-C2 linker became evident. The short, direct connection between the C1 and C2 domains identified the single ordered C1 domain as the C1B domain and confirmed that these domains belonged to the same PKCβII molecule.

The initial map calculated following DEN refinement with a model lacking residues 620–639 revealed a novel and well-ordered conformation for this entire region (Figure 1C). The sequence could be assigned to this region, in spite of the limited resolution. Clear side-chain density was visible for Phe629, Phe632, and Phe633, providing an unambiguous set of markers to assign the primary sequence to the model. Residues 624–634 are helical, and the register of these residues was therefore defined with high confidence. Because these residues include the conserved motif NFD (residues 628–630; see Figure 2E ), we refer to them as the “NFD helix.” Side-chain features were less obvious for the sections 620–623 and 635–639. However, the main-chain density was nearly continuous and the start and end points of these sections were anchored either to landmarks in the catalytic domain or to the assigned sequence in the new helix. Therefore these assignments also have a high confidence level. The C1B-C2 connector 151–158 has poorer density and its register is not assigned with high confidence. As described below, the configuration of the C1B-C2 linker in this structure is probably not physiologically relevant, so this limitation of the model does not affect its functional interpretation. The DEN refinement led to an excellent free R factor of 0.25. Nevertheless, the pseudosubstrate and C1A domains and the V3 (C2-kinase) linker were completely absent from the electron density. The kinase domain adopts the intermediate open conformation, as also observed in the bisindolymaleimide-bound isolated kinase domain structure (Figures 2A and 2B) (Grodsky et al., 2006Grodsky N. Li Y. Bouzida D. Love R. Jensen J. Nodes B. Nonomiya J. Grant S. Structure of the catalytic domain of human protein kinase C β II complexed with a bisindolylmaleimide inhibitor.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13970-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), with minor exceptions noted below. The lattice is stabilized by contacts between the C2 domain of one PKC and two different instances of the catalytic domain (Figure S2A). The Ca2+-binding regions (CBRs) of the C2 span the two lobes of the first instance of the catalytic domain (Figure S2A, contact 1). The burial of the C2-bound Ca2+ ions in an interface with the catalytic domain would be inconsistent with the physiological function of these ions in bridging PKC to the membrane (Nalefski and Falke, 1996Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. The C2 domain calcium-binding motif: Structural and functional diversity.Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), therefore we dismissed this lattice contact as functionally irrelevant. The other major lattice contact involves nonconserved polar residues of both the C2 domain and the catalytic domain (Figure S2A, contact 2). Because the C2 domain is a conserved and functionally important feature of conventional and novel PKCs, we anticipated that functionally relevant contacts should include at least some conserved residues. This second contact is formed by some of the least conserved regions on both the C2 and catalytic domains, and therefore we judged its functional relevance to be implausible. Moreover, the conformation of the C2 domain in this structure is not judged to represent the closed, fully autoinhibited conformation of PKCβII. As described below, this conformation is not consistent with SAXS analysis of PKCβII in solution. Rather, it probably represents a snapshot of the behavior of the C2 domain in the activated state as trapped by lattice contacts. Strong difference density in a phosphate omit map is observed for the activation loop, confirming the phosphorylation of Thr500 (Figure S2C). Difference omit density is also observed for the C-terminal tail of the kinase, confirming the presence of the canonical turn and hydrophobic motif phospho-Thr641 and phospho-Ser660 (Figures S2D and S2E). The active site contains bound AMPPNP and Mg2+; however, the Mg2+ ions could not be positioned accurately into the model given the limitation of 4.0 Å resolution. One of the unexpected features of this structure is the unusual positioning of the residues of the NFD motif (Figure 2), a conserved catalytic element of the AGC kinases. In the present structure, the NFD helix preceding residues in the C-terminal tail of PKCβII is in what we refer to as the “clamped” conformation (Figures 2A and 2B). The clamp keeps the NFD Phe629 out of the active site, but it is in intimate and extensive contact with both the C1B and catalytic domains. The Phe residue of this motif is normally part of the active site and binds the adenine of ATP, on the basis of the ATP-PKCι complex (Takimura et al., 2010Takimura T. Kamata K. Fukasawa K. Ohsawa H. Komatani H. Yoshizumi T. Takahashi I. Kotani H. Iwasawa Y. Structures of the PKC-ι kinase domain in its ATP-bound and apo forms reveal defined structures of residues 533-551 in the C-terminal tail and their roles in ATP binding.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and it is not part of a helix. We refer to the active conformation of the NFD motif as the “in” conformation (Figure 2C). Grodsky et al., 2006Grodsky N. Li Y. Bouzida D. Love R. Jensen J. Nodes B. Nonomiya J. Grant S. Structure of the catalytic domain of human protein kinase C β II complexed with a bisindolylmaleimide inhibitor.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13970-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar first reported that this sequence could form a helix, in the context of the isolated PKCβII catalytic domain. In the isolated catalytic domain structure (Grodsky et al., 2006Grodsky N. Li Y. Bouzida D. Love R. Jensen J. Nodes B. Nonomiya J. Grant S. Structure of the catalytic domain of human protein kinase C β II complexed with a bisindolylmaleimide inhibitor.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13970-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the Phe is remote from the active site and forms part of a novel helix. We will refer to this as the “out” conformation (Figure 2A). The out conformation has no known regulatory relevance but does illustrate that this region has an intrinsic propensity to form a helix under appropriate conditions. The C1B and catalytic domain have an extensive interface made up mainly of conserved hydrophobic residues. On the catalytic domain side, the contact involves a conserved and mostly nonpolar region on the outer face of the N lobe (Figures 3A and 3B ). On the C1B side, residues from the conserved hydrophobic tip of the domain, and adjoining residues, make contacts with the catalytic domain and NFD helix. In particular, C1B membrane-penetrating side chains of residues Leu125 and Ile126 make extensive contacts with Phe629 of the NFD adenine-binding motif. Finally, residues 619–622, immediately preceding the start of the NFD helix, fill the DAG-binding site of the C1B domain (Figure 3C). The Pro619 carbonyl appears to accept a hydrogen bond from the main-chain amide of Gly124, replacing the 3-oxygen of phorbol ester as seen bound to the C1B domain of PKCδ (Zhang et al., 1995Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H.

The Ala621 main-chain NH appears to donate a hydrogen bond to the main-chain carbonyl of Gly124, serving as a counterpart of the 4-hydroxyl of phorbol ester (Figure 3D). The C1B domain buries a total solvent-accessible area of 1073 Å2 in all contacts with the rest of PKCβII. In the isolated PKCβII catalyt"

Synthetic biology approach enables study of insulated mammalian MAPK modules in yeast Kinase concentrations alone can broadly tune activation dynamics of MAPK cascade Enzymatic cascades can generate ultrasensitivity de novo Integrating regulatory modes allows decoupling of MAPK response characteristics MAPK pathways are ubiquitous, versatile signaling modules found in all eukaryotic cells. They transmit and process signals regulating a broad array of cell fate decisions, including proliferation, differentiation, motility, stress responses, and apoptosis (Avruch, 2007Avruch J. MAP kinase pathways: the first twenty years.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1150-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Though several MAPK families have been elucidated, all consist of three sequential kinases activated by dual, nonprocessive phosphorylation events. The biological design principles underlying a three-tiered cascade structure have been the subject of vigorous debate for many years. A number of hypotheses have been put forth to account for the use of multistep signaling pathways, including signal amplification, increased signaling speed, multiple points of regulation, noise tolerance, and the generation of switch-like responses (Chen and Thorner, 2005Chen R.E. Thorner J. System biology approaches in cell signaling research.Genome Biol. 2005; 6: 235Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Though it is likely that this heavily conserved pathway has evolved to serve multiple purposes, its structure clearly enables great flexibility of system response. Extensive experimental work on MAPK cascades has shown that responses can be graded or switch-like (ultrasensitive), transient or sustained, and monostable or bistable (Bhalla et al., 2002Bhalla U.S. Ram P.T.

A growing body of research has demonstrated that the systems-level properties of MAPK activation vary greatly depending on cellular context and that the characteristics of this activation can determine cell fate. Seminal work on the activation of p42 MAPK in X. laevis demonstrated steep ultrasensitivity (Ferrell and Machleder, 1998Ferrell J.E. Machleder E.M.

Ultrasensitivity in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Graded mode of transcriptional induction in yeast pheromone signalling revealed by single-cell analysis.Yeast. 2001; 18: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A series of studies in mammalian systems showed that different cell types exhibit either switch-like (Bagowski et al., 2003Bagowski C.P. Besser J. Frey C.R. Ferrell Jr., J.E.

Biol. 2004; 24: 10145-10150Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) activation responses. Even within the same cell type, an individual MAPK cascade can exhibit different dynamic responses that lead to distinct cell fates. In PC12 cells, MAPK activation is transient and graded when stimulated with epidermal growth factor, leading to proliferation. In contrast, nerve growth factor stimulation results in cell differentiation through sustained and ultrasensitive MAPK activation (Marshall, 1995Marshall C.J. Specificity of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling: transient versus sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation.Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that altering the activation profile of MAPK in these cells is sufficient to reverse the stimulus-phenotype relationship (Santos et al., 2007Santos S.D. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I. Growth factor-induced MAPK network topology shapes Erk response determining PC-12 cell fate.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Further, in BHK cells, tethering the MAPK module to the plasma membrane can lower the threshold of activation, and consequently, the percentage of cells that differentiate depends upon both the stimulus magnitude and the location of the cascade in the cell (Harding et al., 2005Harding A. Tian T. Westbury E. Frische E. Hancock J.F. Subcellular localization determines MAP kinase signal output.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 869-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been shown that activation of MAPK in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts is dependent upon temporal dynamics of the stimulus (Bhalla et al., 2002Bhalla U.S. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. MAP kinase phosphatase as a locus of flexibility in a mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling network.Science. 2002; 297: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Naive cells exhibit bistable MAPK activation in response to platelet-derived growth factor, whereas previously stimulated cells show proportional, monotonic activation. It has been proposed that this desensitization enables the downregulation of MAPK activity, a molecule whose prolonged stimulation can be deleterious. It is clear from both experimental and theoretical work that the behavior of MAPK cascades in vivo is dictated, in part, by multiple levels of feedback regulation. In particular, bistability, an essential characteristic in many cell fate decisions, arises through feedback. However, feedback alone is not sufficient to achieve bistability. Bistable responses require a nonlinearity in the system, feedback to reinforce the nonlinearity, and proper balance between the system components (Ferrell and Xiong, 2001Ferrell J.E. Xiong W. Bistability in cell signaling: How to make continuous processes discontinuous, and reversible processes irreversible.Chaos. 2001; 11: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Ultrasensitivity in MAPK activation is a critical, systems-level property, as it can serve as the fundamental nonlinearity required to achieve stable, potentially irreversible cellular decisions. Indeed, several experimental studies of bistable MAPK activation report ultrasensitive activation profiles as well (Bhalla et al., 2002Bhalla U.S. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. MAP kinase phosphatase as a locus of flexibility in a mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling network.Science. 2002; 297: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, Ferrell and Machleder, 1998Ferrell J.E. Machleder E.M. The biochemical basis of an all-or-none cell fate switch in Xenopus oocytes.Science. 1998; 280: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, Santos et al., 2007Santos S.D. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I. Growth factor-induced MAPK network topology shapes Erk response determining PC-12 cell fate.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Dissecting the contributions of ultrasensitivity and feedback to a specific bistable response is often untenable in the context of complex endogenous signaling networks. Many biological systems are organized into functional modules that perform key steps in a larger process (Hartwell et al., 1999Hartwell L.H. Hopfield J.J. Leibler S. Murray A.W. From molecular to modular cell biology.Nature. 1999; 402: C47-C52Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar). It is often difficult to characterize the potential behaviors of these component subsystems in vivo because of interconnectivity and complex layers of regulation found in biological systems. This is particularly true in signaling networks, which exhibit multifaceted regulation such as feedback, localization, and extensive, functional crosstalk (Natarajan et al., 2006Natarajan M. Lin K. Hsueh R. Sternweis P. Ranganathan R. A global analysis of cross-talk in a mammalian cellular signalling network.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, interpreting, influencing, and predicting how complex networks carry out biological functions depends critically upon our understanding of their component modules. Here, we use a synthetic biology approach to obviate the challenges of interconnectivity in uncovering the inherent capabilities of the MAPK module; we do so by systematically applying intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations to tune the activation dynamics of a minimal, well-insulated cascade. By studying an isolated module, we develop a mechanistic understanding of the effects of these perturbations both experimentally and computationally. In the present study, we built an exogenous, minimal MAPK cascade to investigate the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic regulators on the plasticity of this isolated signaling module. We expressed the mammalian Raf-MEK-ERK cascade in the yeast S. cerevisiae and applied the intrinsic perturbation of concentration variation between cascade members and the extrinsic perturbations of scaffolding and negative regulation. We show that varying the relative concentrations of MEK and ERK confers great flexibility of the system response and may prime the cascade for either low or high ultrasensitivity. Strikingly, the X. laevis p42 MAPK cascade that shows sharp ultrasensitivity and the S. cerevisiae pheromone pathway that is more graded both fit well within the theoretical framework generated by this intrinsic perturbation. In addition, we identify cascading itself as a concentration-dependent mechanism for generating ultrasensitivity. We further demonstrate that, in contrast to a biphasic dependence on scaffold concentration (prozone effect), expression of a two-member scaffold results in a monotonic dependence of signal strength on scaffold concentration, with a sharp reduction observed at high concentration. Finally, introducing negative regulation of either MEK or ERK leads to a reduction in ultrasensitivity and an increase in threshold, even in the absence of feedback. We used a computational model to integrate these intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations over a large parameter space and found regions in which signal characteristics can be tuned independently. Experimentally, we demonstrate the decoupling of signal strength from the ultrasensitivity and threshold of the response. Thus, through the use of a synthetic signaling module, we identified mechanisms for generating ultrasensitivity, elucidated cellular strategies for tuning the activation of the system, and highlighted regulatory principles that can be used in designing artificial signaling networks. We constructed a basic synthetic cascade using the mammalian pathway of Raf-MEK-ERK (Figure 1A ) in which the Raf level of the cascade is a hormone-binding domain fusion protein, eGFP:ΔRaf-1:ER-DD (Raf:ER), whose kinase activity is modulated by the addition of β-estradiol (McMahon, 2001McMahon M. Steroid receptor fusion proteins for conditional activation of Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway.Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 401-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Consequently, the entire cascade is cytosolic (Figure S1 available online) and does not depend upon receptor-mediated membrane recruitment for activation. Single integrated copies of wild-type, epitope-tagged Raf:ER, c-myc-MEK1 (MEK), and His6-ERK2 (ERK) were coexpressed from different auxotrophic loci by a reverse tTA-driven expression system (PtetO7) (Bellí et al., 1998Bellí G. Garí E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. An activator/repressor dual system allows tight tetracycline-regulated gene expression in budding yeast.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) induced with anhydrotetracycline (aTC). The system was stimulated with estradiol and assayed for steady-state activated ERK directly with quantitative western blotting (Figure 1B) to eliminate additional signal processing steps such as transcriptional activation (Mackeigan et al., 2005Mackeigan J.P. Murphy L.O. Dimitri C.A. Blenis J. Graded mitogen-activated protein kinase activity precedes switch-like c-Fos induction in mammalian cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4676-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As designed, our system is not bistable, as it does not fulfill the requirements of nonlinearity, feedback, and proper balance, and therefore the population mean reflects the unique activation state of the system. When the three kinases were expressed at equal concentration levels, the system reached a half-maximal response (EC50) at 32 ± 1.4 nM and exhibited moderate ultrasensitivity (Figure 1C). The apparent Hill coefficient attained by this basic, constant-expression cascade, nH = 1.8 ± 0.13, fits well within the range of sensitivities observed in natural systems.Figure S1Component Localization and Interaction with Endogenous Phosphatases, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Representative phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy images of cells expressing eGFP:ΔRaf-1:ER (Raf:ER), MEK1-mCherry, or mCherry-ERK2.

The data represent the mean ± SEM. An ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of the basic cascade based on mass action kinetics (Huang and Ferrell, 1996Huang C.Y. Ferrell J.E. Ultrasensitivity in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) accurately captures the response (Figure 1C). All parameters and initial conditions were refined from literature values by globally fitting the Hill coefficient, signal strength, and EC50 to the experimental steady-state response curves of the basic and variable expression cascades (Extended Experimental Procedures). Parameter values were then held constant in simulating subsequent perturbations. The model assumes nonprocessive, dual-step phosphorylation events between sequential kinases, as has been demonstrated experimentally (Burack and Sturgill, 1997Burack W.R. Sturgill T.W. The activating dual phosphorylation of MAPK by MEK is nonprocessive.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5929-5933Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Insulation of this exogenous cascade from the host was assayed by a variety of methods. We identified possible interaction pathways by homology (Avruch, 2007Avruch J. MAP kinase pathways: the first twenty years.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1150-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and previous findings in the literature (Atienza et al., 2000Atienza J.M. Suh M. Xenarios I. Landgraf R. Colicelli J. Human ERK1 induces filamentous growth and cell wall remodeling pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20638-20646Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and consequently designed pathway-specific transcriptional reporters for the pheromone, invasive growth, and cell wall integrity pathways in S. cerevisiae. The synthetic cascade was stimulated with estradiol, and expression of tdTomato from each native pathway-specific promoter was determined by flow cytometry. We found minimal transcriptional activation from each of the endogenous pathways assayed when compared with pathway-specific positive controls (Figure 1D). In addition, we stimulated cells with agonists of endogenous MAPK pathways, including α factor (Bashor et al., 2008Bashor C.J. Helman N.C. Yan S. Lim W.A. Using engineered scaffold interactions to reshape MAP kinase pathway signaling dynamics.Science. 2008; 319: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), glucose depletion (Cullen and Sprague, 2000Cullen P.J. Sprague Jr., G.F. Glucose depletion causes haploid invasive growth in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 13619-13624Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and caffeine (Jung et al., 2002Jung U.S. Sobering A.K. Romeo M.J. Levin D.E. Regulation of the yeast Rlm1 transcription factor by the Mpk1 cell wall integrity MAP kinase.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and determined the activation level of the synthetic MAPK cascade. We found almost no phosphorylation of ERK in response to glucose starvation and caffeine and ∼15% activation in response to α factor despite the significant impact that these stimuli have on diverse cellular processes (Figure 1E). Further, we assayed for dephosphorylation of the synthetic cascade by endogenous phosphatases and found very modest interaction with these negative regulators (Figure S1). Taken together, these data indicate that the synthetic cascade is well insulated from the host, and the dynamic responses that we observe are a result of the minimal system itself and do not arise from unknown endogenous effectors. In natural systems, Raf, MEK, and ERK are present at different concentrations, frequently increasing for sequential kinases. Further, the relative concentrations of cascade members vary significantly across different experimental systems (Ferrell, 1996Ferrell J.E. Tripping the switch fantastic: how a protein kinase cascade can convert graded inputs into switch-like outputs.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 460-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). To understand the systems-level effects of this intrinsic perturbation, we constructed a cascade increasing the kinase concentration of each subsequent step, achieving ∼10-fold difference across the entire cascade (Figure 2A ). Concentration was varied by expressing a single, integrated copy of Raf:ER with PtetO7, high-copy MEK with PtetO7, and high-copy ERK from the Gal1 promoter (PGal) induced with galactose. The concentration range of this synthetic system was initially determined computationally by a global fit to the basic and variable cascades and was verified experimentally by quantitative ELISA against ERK (Figure S2). Under this perturbation, we found that the ultrasensitivity increased from nH = 1.8 ± 0.13 to 2.8 ± 0.19, whereas the threshold was reduced from 32 ± 1.4 nM to 6.6 ± 0.14 nM (Figure 2B).Figure S2Total ERK2 Quantitation, Related to Figure 2Show full captionThe concentration of ERK2 expressed from a single-integrated copy by PtetO7 induced with 0.5 μg/ml aTC and from a high-copy episomal PGal induced with 2% galactose, determined by model predictions (gray) and quantified experimentally by ELISA (red).

The data represent the mean ± SEM. Qualitatively, this response is captured well by our computational model (Figure 2C). Interestingly, for this experimentally attainable range of parameter values, the model predicts that the MEK concentration will have a greater effect than that of ERK on both the ultrasensitivity and threshold of the response. We computationally varied MEK and ERK from 10 nM to 100 nM and determined the Hill coefficient and EC50 of each activation response (Figures 2D and 2E). The slope of the resulting surfaces is steeper when MEK is varied for a fixed value of ERK than when ERK is varied for a fixed MEK value. Therefore, we hypothesized that reducing the concentration of MEK in our variable cascade would increase the threshold and reduce the ultrasensitivity of the response. To test this hypothesis, we built a variable expression cascade with a concentration of MEK in between those in the basic and original variable cascades (Figures 2F and 2G). In this low-MEK variable cascade, MEK was expressed from a single integrated copy by PGal, whereas the Raf:ER and ERK levels were kept the same in the two variable cascades. As predicted, lowering MEK expression resulted in both a reduction in ultrasensitivity from nH = 2.8 ± 0.19 to 2.0 ± 0.19 and an increase in threshold from EC50 = 6.6 ± 0.14 nM to 15 ± 0.78 nM when compared with the high-MEK cascade (Figures 2B and 2F). Scaffolding has been shown to be critical to signal transduction for some MAPK pathways (Elion, 2001Elion E.A. The Ste5p scaffold.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3967-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas, in others, the effects of colocalization remain unclear (Kolch, 2005Kolch W. Coordinating ERK/MAPK signalling through scaffolds and inhibitors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is evident that scaffold concentration can be a strong determinant of MAPK activation (Burack and Shaw, 2000Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. Signal transduction: hanging on a scaffold.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, Levchenko et al., 2000Levchenko A. Bruck J. Sternberg P.W.

Scaffold proteins confer diverse regulatory properties to protein kinase cascades.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, we coexpressed the basic cascade with a modified two-member (MEK and ERK) scaffold, paxillinY118D (pax∗), and varied the scaffold concentration from ∼30 nM to 100 nM by expression from single-copy and high-copy PGal (Figure 3A ). Association of ERK and wild-type paxillin is regulated by phosphorylation of Tyr118 (Ishibe et al., 2003Ishibe S. Joly D. Zhu X. Cantley L.G. Phosphorylation-dependent paxillin-ERK association mediates hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated epithelial morphogenesis.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1275-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which we mimicked with mutation to Asp and verified by coimmunoprecipitation (Figure S3). We found that moderate expression of pax∗ from single-copy PGal results in a slight reduction in ultrasensitivity and a marginal effect on signal strength (Figure 3B). In contrast, we observed a marked decrease in signal strength to ∼25% unscaffolded levels when pax∗ is coexpressed from high-copy PGal. These results demonstrate that the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade is inherently catalytically efficient and does not depend on scaffolding to effectively propagate a signal. This is in contrast to some native yeast MAPK cascades, such as the mating and high-osmolarity pathways, that require scaffolding (Qi, 2005Qi M. MAP kinase pathways.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3569-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our findings show that, when expressed near stoichiometric ratios that are optimal for signal propagation (Levchenko et al., 2000Levchenko A. Bruck J. Sternberg P.W. Scaffold proteins may biphasically affect the levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and reduce its threshold properties.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 5818-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), scaffolding has a negligible effect on signal strength compared to that of the basic cascade.Figure S3Coimmunoprecipitation of pax∗ and ERK2 and Computational pax∗ Models, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Crude cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with antibody against paxillin and detected by Western blot using both paxillin and total ERK antibodies, demonstrating association of ERK2 and pax∗.(B) The basic cascade is shown in black on all graphs.

Representative curves of a well-mixed scaffold model are also presented (right panel). Importantly, neither the well-mixed model nor the compartmental model assuming no ERK-pax∗ association are capable of generating a biphasic dose-response curve, supporting our hypothesis that compartmentalization is necessary to see this behavior.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Crude cell lysate was im"

In this study, we report developmental plasticity in mating behavior as induced by temperature during development in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Males and females reciprocally change their sexual roles depending on their larval rearing temperatures. This switch is correlated with a change in mating benefits to females and costs to males. The discrete seasonal environments, wet season and dry season, are known to produce the two developmental forms and as a consequence impose alternating, symmetrical patterns of sexual selection, one season on male ornaments, the following season on female ornaments. Thus, reciprocal selection through time may result in mutual sexual ornamentation."

Each year in North America, 1–3% of hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics become infected with C. difficile, leading to thousands of deaths and over $1 billion in associated costs to the health-care system (4Kelly C.P.

C. difficile produces two primary virulence factors, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), which are large (308 and 269 kDa, respectively) single-subunit exotoxins composed of a catalytic, a translocation, and a cell receptor binding domain (RBD) (7Jank T.

Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 15R-22RCrossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It has been suggested TcdB is solely responsible for C. difficile virulence (9Lyras D. O'Connor J.R. Howarth P.M. Sambol S.P. Carter G.P. Phumoonna T. Poon R. Adams V. Vedantam G. Johnson S. Gerding D.N. Rood J.I. Nature. 2009; 458: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), although a recent study found both TcdA and TcdB knock-out strains are capable of causing mortality in hamsters (10Kuehne S.A. Cartman S.T. Heap J.T. Kelly M.L. Cockayne A. Minton N.P. Nature. 2010; 467: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). This latter finding is in agreement with earlier work that showed both anti-TcdA and anti-TcdB mAbs were required for full protection of hamsters from CDAD (11Babcock G.J. Broering T.J. Hernandez H.J. Mandell R.B. Donahue K. Boatright N. Stack A.M. Lowy I. Graziano R. Molrine D. Ambrosino D.M. Thomas Jr., W.D. Infect.

Immun. 1991; 59: 1192-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Patients suffering from CDAD are most commonly treated with metronidazole or vancomycin (2Leffler D.A. Lamont J.T. Gastroenterology. 2009; 136: 1899-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, there are several emerging challenges warranting the development of novel therapeutics. First, there is no acute CDAD treatment targeting TcdA/B. These toxins are responsible for loss of epithelial barrier function in the colon by disrupting tight junctions and increasing membrane permeability, causing diarrhea and promoting severe inflammation (1Rupnik M. Wilcox M.H. Gerding D.N. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 526-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 7Jank T. Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 222-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Second, hypervirulent strains of C. difficile, such as the NAP1/027 isolate, overexpress TcdA and TcdB (14Warny M. Pepin J. Fang A. Killgore G. Thompson A. Brazier J. Frost E. McDonald L.C. Lancet. 2005; 366: 1079-1084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar) and have been associated with increased mortality rates and disease severity (15O'Connor J.R. Johnson S. Gerding D.N. Gastroenterology. 2009; 136: 1913-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 16Pépin J. Valiquette L. Cossette B. CMAJ. 2005; 173: 1037-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Third, an estimated 20–25% of patients suffering from CDAD experience symptomatic relapse after the initial infection is cleared, with 45% of these patients prone to subsequent relapses (17Johnson S. J. Infect. 2009; 58: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Taken together, there is a need for nonantibiotic-based reagents that target and inhibit TcdA and TcdB for CDAD therapy. Individuals who are asymptomatic C. difficile carriers and patients who experience mild cases of CDAD tend to possess high anti-TcdA titers (18Kyne L. Warny M. Qamar A. Kelly C.P. Lancet. 2001; 357: 189-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 19Kyne L. Warny M. Qamar A. Kelly C.P. N. Engl. J.

Conversely, patients susceptible to relapsing C. difficile infection have low anti-TcdA immunoglobulin titers, specifically IgM, IgG2, and IgG3 isotypes (18Kyne L. Warny M. Qamar A. Kelly C.P. Lancet. 2001; 357: 189-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 22Katchar K. Taylor C.P. Tummala S. Chen X. Sheikh J. Kelly C.P. Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2007; 5: 707-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). TcdA-neutralizing secretory IgA antibodies are also thought to play a role in regulating CDAD severity (23Johal S.S. Lambert C.P. Hammond J. James P.D. Borriello S.P. Mahida Y.R. J. Clin. Pathol. 2004; 57: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Kelly C.P. Pothoulakis C. Orellana J. LaMont J.T. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 35-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, the introduction of antitoxin antibodies to patients suffering from severe C. difficile infection may be a therapeutically useful approach. A limited number of animal and human studies have illustrated the effectiveness of antitoxin Abs for treatment of CDAD (25Hussack G. Tanha J. Toxins. 2010; 2: 998-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Babcock et al. (11Babcock G.J. Broering T.J. Hernandez H.J. Mandell R.B. Donahue K. Boatright N. Stack A.M. Lowy I. Graziano R.

A recently completed human trial involving these two mAbs appears promising for treating CDAD relapse (26Lowy I. Molrine D.C. Leav B.A. Blair B.M. Baxter R. Gerding D.N. Nichol G. Thomas Jr., W.D. Leney M. Sloan S. Hay C.A. Ambrosino D.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In another study, intravenous administration of anti-TcdA mAbs raised against the RBD followed by oral challenge with C. difficile resulted in protection of mice (13Corthier G. Muller M.C. Wilkins T.D. Lyerly D. L'Haridon R. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1192-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elsewhere, a toxoid vaccine given by the intraperitoneal route to hamsters conferred protection against oral C. difficile challenge (27Giannasca P.J. Zhang Z.X. Lei W.D. Boden J.A.

Intravenous immunoglobulin involves administration of high concentrations (150–400 mg/kg) of human immunoglobulins from healthy donors that are thought to contain neutralizing antitoxin antibodies, because an estimated 60% of healthy adults have detectable TcdA- and TcdB-specific serum IgG antibodies (21Viscidi R. Laughon B.E. Yolken R. Bo-Linn P. Moench T. Ryder R.W. Bartlett J.G. J. Infect. Dis. 1983; 148: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Given that C. difficile toxins rely on attachment to epithelial cells for entry (7Jank T. Aktories K.

In animals, orally administered bovine immunoglobulin concentrate containing TcdA- and TcdB-neutralizing IgGs were able to prevent hamster mortality when used as a prophylactic (35Lyerly D.M.

The limited success of both oral and systemic antitoxin immunotherapy in clinical settings has likely been hampered by the high immunoglobulin dose requirements (150–400 mg/kg), the associated costs of these doses, and a lack of published clinical data showing the effectiveness of these treatments. Alternatives to mAbs for antitoxin immunotherapy are variable heavy-chain single-domain antibodies (VHHs), which are isolated from the heavy-chain IgG (HCAb) of Camelidae species (40Hamers-Casterman C.

Here, we set out to isolate VHHs capable of binding and neutralizing C. difficile TcdA and TcdB. We hypothesized that VHHs targeting the RBD region of toxin will block the toxin-receptor interaction, thereby preventing toxin entry into the host cell, which is a critical initial step in the TcdA/B mechanism of action (7Jank T. Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 222-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To do so, an immune llama VHH phage display library was constructed and panned with recombinant RBD fragments. The isolated VHHs were then characterized for their ability to bind native toxins and recombinant RBD fragments and the nature and relative positioning of epitopes. In addition, the ability of VHHs to neutralize toxins in an in vitro cell cytotoxicity assay was assessed. These findings and the potential applications of VHHs in treating infectious disease are discussed. TcdA and TcdB were isolated from C. difficile strain 10463 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) as described previously (65Keel M.K. Songer J.G. Vet. Pathol. 2007; 44: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and were stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. Recombinant fragments of TcdA (amino acid residues 2304–2710) and TcdB (amino acid residues 2286–2366), which are fragments of the RBD, were cloned (as a BamHI-HindIII fragment for tcdA and a BamHI-EcoRI fragment for tcdB) into pTrcHisB (Invitrogen), transforming E. coli DH5αMCR. Expression was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cells were harvested and lysed in a French pressure cell, and proteins TcdA-RBD-f1 and TcdB-RBD-f1 were purified by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography. Recombinant RBD fragments were dialyzed into PBS, pH 7.3, and stored at 4 °C. One male llama (Lama glama) was immunized by subcutaneous lower back injection of TcdA-RBD-f1 and TcdB-RBD-f1 antigens. On day 1, 200 μg of each antigen diluted in PBS to 1 ml was injected with 1 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma). Three more injections of 100 μg of each antigen + Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma) were performed on days 22, 36, and 50. A final injection of 100 μg of each antigen with no adjuvant was performed on day 77. Preimmune blood was drawn before the first injection on day 1 and served as a negative control. Blood (10–15 ml) was collected on days 29, 43, 57, and 84. Preimmune and postimmune total serum was analyzed for a specific response to TcdA-RBD-f1 and TcdB-RBD-f1 by ELISA on day 57 (see below). Llama serum from day 84 was fractionated as before (66Doyle P.J. Arbabi-Ghahroudi M. Gaudette N. Furzer G. Savard M.E. Gleddie S. McLean M.D. Mackenzie C.R. Hall J.C. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 3703-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The resulting fractions, A1 (HCAb), A2 (HCAb), G1 (HCAb), and G2 (conventional IgG), were analyzed for specific binding to TcdA-RBD-f1 and TcdB-RBD-f1 by ELISA. Briefly, 5 μg of TcdA-RBD-f1 or TcdB-RBD-f1 diluted in PBS was coated overnight (100 μl/well, 18 h, 4 °C) in 96-well MaxisorpTM plates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). Plates were blocked with bovine BSA and washed with PBS-T (PBS + 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), and serial dilutions of preimmune total serum, postimmune total serum (day 57), and fractionated serum (day 84; 100 μg/ml starting concentration) were applied. After incubation at room temperature for 1.5 h and washing with PBS-T, goat anti-llama IgG (1:1,000 in PBS) was added for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS-T, pig anti-goat IgG-HRP conjugate (1:3,000 in PBS) was added for 1 h at 37 °C. A final PBS-T wash precluded the addition of 100 μl/well TMB substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with 100 μl/well 1 m H3PO4 and read on a Bio-Rad plate reader at 450 nm. Library construction and panning were performed essentially as described previously (67Arbabi-Ghahroudi M. MacKenzie R. Tanha J. Methods Mol.

Total RNA was isolated from ∼5 × 106 lymphocytes collected on day 84 post-immunization using the QIAamp RNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). About 5 μg of total RNA was used as template for first strand cDNA synthesis with oligo(dT) primers using the first-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (GE Healthcare). The cDNA was PCR-amplified by an equimolar mix of three variable region-specific sense primers (MJ1, 5′-GCCCAGCCGGCCATGGCCSMKGTGCAGCTGGTGGAKTCTGGGGGA-3′; MJ2, 5′-CAGCCGGCCATGGCCCAGGTAAAGCTGGAGGAGTCTGGGGGA-3′; and MJ3, 5′-GCCCAGCCGGCCATGGCCCAGGCTCAGGTACAGCTGGTGGAGTCT-3′) and two antisense CH2-specific primers (CH2, 5′-CGCCATCAAGGTACCAGTTGA-3′ and CH2b3, 5′-GGTACCTGTCATCCACGGACCAGCTGA-3′). Briefly, the PCR mixture was set up in a total volume of 50 μl with the following components: 1–3 μl of cDNA, 5 pmol of MJ1–3 primer mixture, 5 pmol of either CH2 or CH2b3 primers, 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP, and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Hoffmann-La Roche). The PCR protocol consisted of an initial step at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. The amplified PCR products were run in a 1% agarose gel, and two major bands were observed as follows: a band of about 850 bp, corresponding to conventional IgG, and a second band of around 600 bp, corresponding to HCAbs. The smaller bands were cut and purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and re-amplified in a second PCR in a total volume of 50 μl using 1 μl of DNA template, 5 pmol of each of MJ7 primer (5′-CATGTGTAGACTCGCGGCCCAGCCGGCCATGGCC-3′) and MJ8 primer (5′-CATGTGTAGATTCCTGGCCGGCCTGGCCTGAGGAGACGGTGACCTGG-3′), 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP, and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase. The PCR protocol consisted of an initial step at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min and a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. The amplified PCR products, ranging between 340 and 420 bp and corresponding to VHH fragments of HCAbs, were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), digested with SfiI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Pickering, Ontario, Canada), and re-purified using the same kit. Eighty micrograms of pMED1 phagemid (67Arbabi-Ghahroudi M. MacKenzie R. Tanha J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 525: 187-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was digested with SfiI overnight at 50 °C. To minimize self-ligation, 20 units of XhoI and PstI restriction enzymes were added, and the digestion reaction was incubated for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. Sixty micrograms of digested phagemid DNA was ligated with 6 μg of digested VHH fragments for 3 h at room temperature using LigaFast Rapid DNA ligation system (Promega, Madison, WI) and its protocol. The ligated materials were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit in a final volume of 100 μl and electroporated in 5-μl portions into commercial electrocompetent TG1 E. coli cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (67Arbabi-Ghahroudi M.

https://openalex.org/W1999973984,"Seismic discontinuities in Earth typically arise from structural, chemical, or temperature variations with increasing depth. The pressure-induced iron spin state transition in the lower mantle may influence seismic wave velocities by changing the elasticity of iron-bearing minerals, but no seismological evidence of an anomaly exists. Inelastic x-ray scattering measurements on (Mg(0.83)Fe(0.17))O-ferropericlase at pressures across the spin transition show effects limited to the only shear moduli of the elastic tensor. This explains the absence of deviation in the aggregate seismic velocities and, thus, the lack of a one-dimensional seismic signature of the spin crossover. The spin state transition does, however, influence shear anisotropy of ferropericlase and should contribute to the seismic shear wave anisotropy of the lower mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2004844618,"The Alzheimer's disease-linked gene presenilin is required for intramembrane proteolysis of amyloid-β precursor protein, contributing to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration that is characterized by loss of neuronal connections, but the role of Presenilin in establishing neuronal connections is less clear. Through a forward genetic screen in mice for recessive genes affecting motor neurons, we identified the Columbus allele, which disrupts motor axon projections from the spinal cord. We mapped this mutation to the Presenilin-1 gene. Motor neurons and commissural interneurons in Columbus mutants lacking Presenilin-1 acquire an inappropriate attraction to Netrin produced by the floor plate because of an accumulation of DCC receptor fragments within the membrane that are insensitive to Slit/Robo silencing. Our findings reveal that Presenilin-dependent DCC receptor processing coordinates the interplay between Netrin/DCC and Slit/Robo signaling. Thus, Presenilin is a key neural circuit builder that gates the spatiotemporal pattern of guidance signaling, thereby ensuring neural projections occur with high fidelity."

Theta rhythms in freely moving rats were also disrupted. Our results show that gap junction-mediated neuronal transmission is a prominent feature underlying emotional memories."
https://openalex.org/W2063597810,"NifEN plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of the nitrogenase iron-molybdenum (FeMo) cofactor (M cluster). It is an α(2)β(2) tetramer that is homologous to the catalytic molybdenum-iron (MoFe) protein (NifDK) component of nitrogenase. NifEN serves as a scaffold for the conversion of an iron-only precursor to a matured form of the M cluster before delivering the latter to its target location within NifDK. Here, we present the structure of the precursor-bound NifEN of Azotobacter vinelandii at 2.6 angstrom resolution. From a structural comparison of NifEN with des-M-cluster NifDK and holo NifDK, we propose similar pathways of cluster insertion for the homologous NifEN and NifDK proteins."

RCAN1 is phosphorylated at Ser112 by BMK1 (big MAP kinase 1), which is the priming site for the subsequent phosphorylation at Ser108 by GSK-3 (21Abbasi S. Lee J.D. Su B. Chen X. Alcon J.L. Yang J.

Furthermore, phosphorylated RCAN1 is a substrate for calcineurin (79Porta S. Serra S.A. Huch M. Valverde M.A. Llorens F. Estivill X. Arbonés M.L. Martí E. Hum. Mol.

However, it was reported that GSK-3 kinase can enhance the calcineurin activity through the RCAN1 phosphorylation in the yeast system (23Hilioti Z. Gallagher D.A. Low-Nam S.T. Ramaswamy P. Gajer P. Kingsbury T.J. Birchwood C.J. Levchenko A. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). RCAN1 could also be phosphorylated by NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), which increases the RCAN1 stability (27Lee E.J. Seo S.R. Um J.W. Park J. Oh Y. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3392-3400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RCAN1 interacts with TAB2 (TAK1 (TGF-β-activated kinase 1)-binding protein 2) to be phosphorylated by TAK1 (28Liu Q. Busby J.C. Molkentin J.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated form of the RCAN1 could serve as a calcineurin facilitator. NFAT is a major substrate for calcineurin, and dephosphorylation of NFAT facilitates NFAT nuclear translocation and activation of its target genes' transcription. RCAN1 can repress the NFAT signaling pathway by inhibition of calcineurin (14Arron J.R. Winslow M.M. Polleri A. Chang C.P. Wu H. Gao X. Neilson J.R. Chen L. Heit J.J. Kim S.K. Yamasaki N. Miyakawa T.

Also, as a downstream gene of the NFAT signaling pathway, RCAN1 can be activated by a subset of molecules, including VEGF, angiotensin II, G protein-coupled receptor 54, TNF-α, thrombin, and other activators of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway, such as calcium ionophore (29Stathatos N. Bourdeau I. Espinosa A.V. Saji M. Vasko V.V. Burman K.D. Stratakis C.A. Ringel M.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 5432-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Minami T. Horiuchi K.

RCAN1 can also be activated by dephosphorylation in neural cells via calcium current increase through the L-type calcium channel (31Cano E. Canellada A. Minami T. Iglesias T. Redondo J.M. J. Biol.

RCAN1 has been shown to be involved in cardiac valve development, cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, angiogenesis, and cancer. RCAN1 has also been implicated in learning and memory. However, the role of RCAN1 in neurodegeneration in AD and DS is unknown. In this study, we show that RCAN1 is overexpressed in cortical tissues from AD and DS patients. To investigate the mechanism of RCAN1 overexpression in AD and DS, we characterized human RCAN1 gene promoters and identified a functional glucocorticoid response element (GRE), through which RCAN1 expression is up-regulated by stress hormone dexamethasone. Here we show that RCAN1 mediates glucocorticoid-induced neuronal apoptosis. We found that overexpression of RCAN1-1 in primary neurons activates the caspase-9 and caspase-3 apoptotic pathway, thereby rendering neurons more vulnerable to apoptosis induced by dexamethasone and Aβ. Our data suggest that RCAN1 overexpression may contribute to AD pathogenesis by mediating neuronal death in the brains of DS and AD patients. A forward primer corresponding to −684 bp (5′-ccgctcgaggtcctcttatttttccgctatttc-3′) of the transcriptional start site and a reverse primer corresponding to the coding sequence (5′-cacaagcttgtcctgcaggtccacctc-3′) were used to PCR-amplify the 5′-UTR region of the RCAN1 gene exon 1 from the genome of human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y. The DNA fragment was cloned into pGL3-Basic upstream of the luciferase reporter gene to construct pRCANluc-G. The fragment from −684 to +46 bp was amplified and cloned using primers 5′-ccgctcgaggtcctcttatttttccgctatttc and 5′-cacaagctttgtcagcagtctcccagc, corresponding to +46 bp of the transcriptional start site on RCAN1 gene exon 1. Primers 5′-gctagctagcaatatattgtgaacc and 5′-cacctcgagtgagcagacatgtctc were used to amplify the region between −1650 and −685 bp in the 5′-UTR of RCAN1 gene exon 1. The amplified fragment was inserted in front of the −684 to 46 bp fragment in pRCANluc-B to obtain the pRCANluc-A. Primers were designed to include restriction enzyme sites so that the resulting PCR-amplified fragment could be easily cloned into the multicloning sites of vector pGL3-Basic (Promega). Deletion plasmids pRCANluc-C, -D, and -E were created from pRCANluc-A by utilization of restriction enzyme sites ApaI, PvuII, and EcoRI, respectively. Neuronal tissues for primary cultures originating from Wistar rat embryos at 17–18 days of gestation were dissected and gently digested with trypsin (0.025% EDTA; Invitrogen). The cells were suspended in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and plated at a density of 1–2 × 105 cells/well onto poly-d-lysine (0.01 mg/ml; Sigma)-coated 24-well plates (Nunc). The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and used for experiments after 7–14 days. Primary neuronal cultures derived from caspase-3 knock-out (caspase-3−/−) (32Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar) and wild type newborn mice were isolated and cultured as described (33Sun X. He G. Song W. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1369-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells and human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). All cells were maintained in a 37 °C incubator containing 5% CO2. Synthesized Aβ(1–40) was dissolved in sterile double-distilled H2O to 1 mm. The dissolved Aβ was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and diluted again with the same volume of PBS (1:1 dilution). Aβ was aged at 37 °C for 4 days, allowing the stable growth of Aβ fibrils. Cells were grown to ∼70% confluence and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA/35-mm plate using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described (34Sun X. Wang Y. Qing H. Christensen M.A. Liu Y. Zhou W. Tong Y. Xiao C. Huang Y. Zhang S. Liu X. Song W. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The pCH110 β-galactosidase expression plasmid was co-transfected to normalize for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in 200 μl of 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). The luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega) as described (35Christensen M.A. Zhou W. Qing H. Lehman A. Philipsen S. Song W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A primer extension assay was performed to determine the transcription initiation site. Total neuronal RNA was extracted from SH-SY5Y cells using TRI-Reagent (Sigma). Yeast tRNA was used as a control. A reverse primer, corresponding to positions +46 to +28 bp, 5′-cacaagctttgtcagcagtctcccagc, was synthesized and radioactively end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). Primer extension and sequencing were performed as described (34Sun X. Wang Y. Qing H. Christensen M.A. Liu Y. Zhou W. Tong Y. Xiao C. Huang Y. Zhang S. Liu X. Song W.

Oligonucleotide RCAN1−272−237bp (5′-cagctgtcagaaaagcggaactggggacgaggactt) and its antisense strand (5′-aagtcctcgtccccagttccgcttttctgacagctg) were synthesized to generate a double-stranded RCAN1-GRE oligonucleotide probe. The GRE consensus oligonucleotide was generated by annealing 5′-agaggatcTGTACAggaTGTTCTagat with 5′- atctAGAACAtccTGTACAgatcctct (core sequence is italic and uppercase). The RCAN1-GRE probe was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Gel shift assays were performed as described (36Sun X. He G. Qing H. Zhou W. Dobie F. Cai F. Staufenbiel M. Huang L.E. Song W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18727-18732Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by a 4% nondenaturing PAGE gel. The RCAN1 expression plasmid pcDNA3.1-RCAN1mycHis was generated as described (37Ma H. Xiong H. Liu T. Zhang L. Godzik A. Zhang Z. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1485-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). RCAN1-1 cDNA was cloned into a Semliki Forest virus vector pSFV to generate pSFV-RCAN1, and a green fluorescent protein cDNA was cloned into pSFV to generate pSFV-GFP. To generate the virus, pSFV1-EGFP, pSFV1-RCAN1myc, pSFV-RCAN1GFP, and helper virus pHelper-2 DNA were linearized by SpeI or SapI. Viral particles were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For infection, the viral particles activated with chymotrypsin (Sigma) were added to neuronal cultures at a 1:10 dilution with culture medium. Cells were infected for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by replacement of the infection media with conditioned culture medium and incubated for 12–18 h prior to use. Then the infected neurons were monitored for expression of GFP or immunostained for detection of Myc tag by 9E10 antibody to visualize RCAN1 expression in SFV-RCAN1myc-infected neurons. The rabbit anti-RCAN1 polyclonal antibody was raised against the C terminus of RCAN1 protein (RPKPKIIQTRRPEYTPIHLS). The antibody was characterized as being able to specifically detect RCAN1. Brain tissues from AD patients were obtained from the Department of Pathology, Columbia University (New York). Brain tissues of DS abortuses (17–21 gestational weeks) were obtained from University of Maryland Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders. The brain tissues or cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate and 4% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). The lysates were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE for detecting RCAN1 and 16% Tris-Tricine PAGE for caspase-3 and caspase-9. The immunoblotting was performed as described (33Sun X. He G. Song W. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1369-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-RCAN1 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) was used to detect RCAN1 expression. Caspase-3 and its cleaved form P20 were detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against amino acids 29–43 of caspase-3 (Sigma, catalog no. C9598, 1:1000). Caspase-3 cleavage was further confirmed with an anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (catalog no. 9661) from Cell Signaling. Internal control β-actin was analyzed using monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody AC-15 (Sigma, 1:1000). Caspase-9 was detected with anti-caspase-9 from Stressgen (catalog no. AAP-149). RNA was isolated from cells by TRI-Reagent (Sigma). PowerScriptTM reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize the first strand cDNA from an equal amount of the RNA sample following the manufacturer's instructions. The newly synthesized cDNA templates were further amplified by Platinum® TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in a 25-μl reaction. 20–35 cycles of PCR were used to cover the linear range of the PCR amplification. Two pairs of primers were used to specifically amplify RCAN1 isoform 1 (RCAN1-1) and isoform 4 (RCAN1-4), respectively. Primers for isoform 1 are 5′-ggaattcgccaccatggaggaggtggacctg and 5′-cgcgtcgactggctgaggtggatcggcgtg. Isoform 4 was amplified by using 5′-gggtctgtagcgctttcac and 5′-cgcgtcgactggctgaggtggatcggcgtg. A pair of gene-specific primers, 5′-tctggatcctcaccaccatggagaaggc and 5′-atactcgaggcagggatgatgttctg, was used to amplify a 324-bp fragment of GAPDH as an internal control. The samples were further analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. Eastman Kodak Co. Image Station 1000 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to analyze the data. The MTT (Sigma) was added into culture medium of primary neurons and incubated for 4 h in a 37 °C incubator containing 5% CO2. The medium was then removed by a syringe, and 2-propanol-HCl was added to dissolve the dye. Lysates were analyzed with a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 540 nm (Multiskan Ascent, ThermoLab System). Rat primary neurons were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with Hoechst 33258 (1 μg/ml, Sigma) at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and sealed in mount medium (Vector Laboratories). Apoptotic cells were analyzed by a fluorescent microscope (Axiovert 200, Carl Zeiss Inc.). TUNEL staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega and Roche Applied Science). Results were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Activities of caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 were measured with Caspase-Glo® 3/7 (catalog no. G8090) and Caspase-Glo® 9 (catalog no. G8210) assay systems from Promega following the manufacturer's instructions. The luminescence was measured with a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Design). 90% confluent HEK293 cells were harvested and washed three times with cold 1× PBS. The cells were then suspended in mitochondrial isolation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were lysed with a glass homogenizer (15–25 strokes) on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 1000 × g for 5 min in order to get rid of the nuclei and remaining intact cells. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 15 min. The resultant pellet containing mitochondria was washed with mitochondrial isolation buffer. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged for an additional time in order to remove any remaining mitochondria. Previous studies have shown that RCAN1 mRNA is elevated in the brains of DS and AD patients (17Fuentes J.J. Genescà L. Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Pérez-Riba M. Estivill X. de la Luna S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ermak G. Morgan T.E. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38787-38794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), indicating that RCAN1 gene expression is up-regulated at the transcriptional level. To further examine whether RCAN1 is also elevated at the protein level, an antibody specific to RCAN1, DCT3, was used to detect RCAN1 proteins in the brain tissue lysates from AD patients and DS abortuses as well as their age-matched controls. A synthetic peptide DCT with sequence PRKPKIIQTRRPEYTPIHLS corresponding to the C terminus of the human RCAN1 protein was used to immunize a rabbit, and a polyclonal antibody DCT3 was raised against the human RCAN1 protein C terminus. To characterize this RCAN1 antibody, HEK293 cells were transfected with empty vector or pRCAN1-mycHis plasmid. Fig. 1A shows that Myc-tagged RCAN1 proteins were detected by both mouse monoclonal 9E10 anti-Myc antibody and rabbit polyclonal antibody DCT3. Overexpressed RCAN1 protein could not be detected with the preimmunization serum pre-DCT. Furthermore, preincubation of DCT3 with excess DCT peptides resulted in clearance of RCAN1-specific antibody, and the precleared antibody could not detect RCAN1 protein (Fig. 1A). These data clearly demonstrate that our DCT3 antibody is able to specifically detect RCAN1 protein. To examine the localization of RCAN1 protein expression in human brain, human hippocampal and cortical slices were immunostained with DCT3 antibody specifically targeting RCAN1. Immunohistochemistry studies show that DCT3 antibody specifically stains the granule cell layer in the hippocampus and the pyramidal neuronal layers in the cortex (Fig. 1B). RCAN1 expression is detected in both the nucleus and cytosol of neurons. Higher magnification reveals that RCAN1 is preferentially localized in nucleus of pyramidal neurons (Fig. 1B). These results show that RCAN1 is highly and specifically expressed in neurons in the hippocampus and cortex. Because neurons of the hippocampus and cortex are specifically affected in Alzheimer disease, the high and specific expression of RCAN1 in neurons of the hippocampus and cortex suggests that RCAN1 may be involved in AD pathogenesis. RCAN1 proteins were examined in the brain tissue lysates from AD patients and DS abortuses and patients as well as their age-matched controls. Western blot analysis using DCT3 antibody showed that levels of RCAN1 protein are significantly elevated in cortical tissue from DS abortuses (156.7 ± 17.04% relative to control, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, C and D). RCAN1 protein levels are also significantly increased in the cortex of AD patients (173.4 ± 18.84% relative to control, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, E and F). Our data show that RCAN1 is overexpressed in AD and DS brains. The result is consistent with previous reports (39Cook C.N. Hejna M.J. Magnuson D.J. Lee J.M. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2005; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 40Harris C.D. Ermak G. Davies K.J. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because nearly all DS patients will develop AD after their 30s, up-regulation of RCAN1 in both DS and AD suggests that RCAN1 may be involved in AD pathogenesis. Increased RCAN1 levels in DS may be attributed to its triplication on chromosome 21. However, the mechanism of RCAN1 up-regulation in AD is unknown. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which RCAN1 gene expression is up-regulated in AD pathogenesis, we cloned and functionally analyzed a 2000-bp fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the first exon of the human RCAN1 gene. The sequence was deposited to GenBankTM under accession number EF577083 (Fig. 2A). To determine the transcription start site of the human RCAN1 gene, a primer extension assay was performed. A 32P-labeled antisense primer (5′-tgtcagcagtctcccagc) located 302 bp upstream of the translational start site AUG was used to hybridize with neuronal RNA. The primer extension assay yielded a 45-bp major cDNA product. DNA sequencing gel analysis indicates that the major transcription start site is located at 348 bp upstream from the translation start site. Transcription starts with guanine, and this site was designated as +1 (Fig. 2B). A computer-based transcription factor binding site search revealed that this 2.0-kb 5′-flanking region contains several putative regulatory elements, such as AP1, AP2, GATA, OCT1, and USF (Fig. 2A). To determine if the 5′-flanking fragment obtained from genomic DNA contains the promoter of the RCAN1 gene, we cloned the fragment into a promoterless plasmid vector, pGL3-Basic (Fig. 3A). The pGL3-Basic vector lacks eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences upstream of a reporter luciferase gene. Luciferase activity in cells transfected with this plasmid depends on insertion and proper orientation of a functional promoter upstream from the luciferase gene. Luciferase activity is indicative of promoter activity. pRCANluc-A plasmid was constructed to contain a 1.70-kb 5′-flanking region from −1651 to +45 bp of the RCAN1 gene upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. Plasmid DNA was transfected into HEK293 cells and SH-SY5Y cells, and luciferase activity was measured by a luminometer to reflect promoter activity. Compared with an empty vector control, pRCANluc-A-transfected cells had significant luciferase activity at 554.2 ± 44.48 relative luciferase units (RLU) in HEK293 and 461.6 ± 16.82 RLU in SH-SY5Y cells (p < 0.001 relative to controls) (Fig. 3, C and D, lane A and Basic). However, plasmid pRCANlucR-I containing the RCAN1 promoter sequence from −1651 to +45 bp in the reverse orientation (Fig. 3C, lane F) and plasmid pRCANluc-F containing the sequence from −1651 to −686 lacking the transcription initiation site (Fig. 3C, lane I) have little or no luciferase activity. These results indicate that the 1.70-kb fragment contains the functional promoter of the human RCAN1 gene. To analyze the transcriptional activity of the RCAN1 promoter, a series of luciferase reporter gene plasmids containing different upstream deletions of the RCAN1 promoter were constructed and transfected into HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells. The inserts of pRCANluc-B, -C, -D, and -E are the fragments of the RCAN1 promoter from −684, −311, −271, and −167 bp to +45 bp, respectively (Fig. 3A). Analysis of deletion plasmids indicates that pRCANluc-A, pRCANluc-B, pRCANluc-C, and pRCANluc-D have strong promoter activity in H"
https://openalex.org/W2031454744,"The expression of a variety of cytoprotective genes is regulated by short cis-acting elements in their promoters, called antioxidant response elements (AREs). A central regulator of ARE-mediated gene expression is the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2/ARE-regulated genes are crucial for the maintenance of cellular integrity. Hepatitis C virus inhibits the induction of ARE-regulated genes, but neither induction nor inhibition of ARE-regulated gene expression affects HCV replication directly. In HCV-replicating cells the core protein triggers the delocalization of sMaf proteins from the nucleus to the replicon complex. Here sMafs bind to NS3. The extranuclear sMaf proteins prevent Nrf2 from entry in the nucleus and thereby inhibit the induction of Nrf2/ARE-regulated genes. This results in the decreased expression of cytoprotective genes. Consistent with this finding, the elimination of ROI is impaired in HCV-replicating cells as demonstrated by elevated protein oxidation or 8-OH-dG formation, reflecting DNA damage. In conclusion, these data identified a novel mechanism of Nrf2 regulation and suggest that the HCV-dependent inhibition of Nrf2/ARE-regulated genes confers to the HCV-associated pathogenesis by elevation of intracellular ROI that affect integrity of the host genome and regenerative processes.

Consistent with this finding, the elimination of ROI is impaired in HCV-replicating cells as demonstrated by elevated protein oxidation or 8-OH-dG formation, reflecting DNA damage. In conclusion, these data identified a novel mechanism of Nrf2 regulation and suggest that the HCV-dependent inhibition of Nrf2/ARE-regulated genes confers to the HCV-associated pathogenesis by elevation of intracellular ROI that affect integrity of the host genome and regenerative processes. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 2The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; ROI, reactive oxygen intermediates; ARE, antioxidant response elements; NS, nonstructural; DNPH, 2,4,-dinitrophenylhydrazine. infection results in chronic hepatitis in more than 70% of infected individuals. At present more than 170 million people are persistently infected with HCV worldwide. Persistent HCV infection is associated with chronic inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), which can progress to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (1Levrero M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3834-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). HCV is the sole member of the genus hepacivirus that belongs to the flaviridae family. The HCV genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule of ∼9600 bases length. The viral RNA codes for a large polyprotein of ∼3100 amino acids, which is post-translationally processed by cellular and viral proteases. The N terminus encompasses the structural proteins core, E1, and E2; the C terminus the p7 protein and the nonstructural (NS) proteins NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B (2Choo Q.L. Kuo G.

Although the detailed molecular mechanisms by which HCV induces liver injury are not fully understood, there are reports describing that hepatitis C is associated with oxidative stress in human liver cells due to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). The ER-associated viral replication and translation of viral integral membrane proteins (5Tellinghuisen T.L. Marcotrigiano J. Gorbalenya A.E. Rice C.M. J. Biol.

One consequence of the ER stress response is calcium release from the ER, initiating a series of intracellular events, including mitochondrial ROI production induced by Ca2 + signaling (7Dionisio N. Garcia-Mediavilla M.V. Sanchez-Campos S. Majano P.L. Benedicto I. Rosado J.A. Salido G.M. Gonzalez-Gallego J. J. Hepatol. 2009; 50: 872-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, during the immune response to HCV positive cells, inflammatory cells produce high levels of radicals (8Bartosch B. Thimme R. Blum H.E. Zoulim F. J. Hepatol. 2009; 51: 810-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, despite the evidence of generation of ROI during the HCV life cylce, little is known about the interference of HCV with cytoprotective mechansims. Crucial players in the defense against oxidative stress are a variety of cytoprotective genes harboring a short cis acting sequence, the antioxidative response element (ARE), in their promoters(9Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The expression of ARE-regulated genes results in the detoxification of electrophiles and radicals. Examples for ARE-regulated genes are NAD(P)H quinione oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutathione peroxidase (pHGPx), the regulatory and catalytic subunits of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLM and GCLC) or glutathione S-transferases (GST) ya and π(10Vasiliou V.

An essential factor involved in the defense against oxidative stress is the NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2 is a member of the cap “n” collar family of transcription factors (13Li W. Kong A.N. Mol. Carcinog. 2009; 48: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 14Kensler T.W. Wakabayashi N. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 15Kensler T.W. Wakabayashi N. Biswal S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 89-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar). In its inactive state Nrf2 is associated with the actin anchored protein Keap1 and localized within the cytoplasm. Keap1-associated Nrf2 is subjected to rapid proteasomal degradation. However, upon its activation initiated by electrophiles or oxidative molecules Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1, escapes proteasomal degration and quickly translocates into the nucleus with the assistance of a nuclear localization signal. In the nucleus Nrf2 binds to ARE sequences and thereby functions in partnership with other nuclear proteins as a strong transcriptional activator of the respective genes (for recent reviews see Refs. 14Kensler T.W. Wakabayashi N. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar,15Kensler T.W. Wakabayashi N. Biswal S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Consecutive sections of paraffin embedded liver samples derived from HCV-patients or HBV/HCV-negative patients were deparaffinized. The deparaffinized sections were boiled for 4 min in a microwave in citrate buffer pH 6.0. After that the sections were reequilibrated in TBST for 30 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubaion in 0.3% H2O2 for 20 min. In the next step, the samples were washed twice with TBST and incubated for 20 min in blocking solution (10% sBSA in TBST).

Bound antibodies were visualized using a biotinylated secondary antibody and strepatavidin/peroxidase-complex from the Vectastain kit, Vector Laboratories, Inc., according to the instructions of the manufacturer. RNA isolation from liver tissue and from infected primary human hepatocytes was performed using TRIzol (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For cDNA synthesis, 2–4 mg of total RNA were treated with DNase I. First-strand synthesis was carried out using SupercriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the Invitrogen protocol.

Detection of bound secondary antibodies was performed by ECL using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Freiburg, Germany). Protein carbonylation by reactive oxygen intermediates was detected by using OxyBlotTM protein oxidation detection kit (Millipore). 8-OH-dG formation was analyzed using a commercial ELISA system (JalCA). Proteasomes were isolated by differential centrifugation using the protocol of Robek et al. (32Robek M.D. Garcia M.L. Boyd B.S. Chisari F.V. J.

Analysis of constitutive proteasome function was performed using a commercial assay system (20 S Proteasome Activity Assay kit, Millipore) measuring release of the fluorophore 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) after cleavage from the labeled substrate peptide LLVY-AMC. RNA isolation was performed using Trizol (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For cDNA synthesis, 2–4 μg of total RNA were treated with DNase I. First-strand synthesis was carried out using SupercriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed according to the Invitrogen protocol. RT-PCR was performed using the following primers:NQO1fw (5′-GCACTGATCGTACTGGCTCA-3′) NQO1_rev (5′-GAACACTCGCTCAAACCAG-3′), HCVfw (5′-AGTACCACAAGGCCTTTCG-3′) HCVbw (5′-CGGGAGAGCCATAGTGG-3′), and β-actin_fw (5′-GAGCTGCGTGTGGCTCCC-3′) β-actin_rev (5′-ATGTCACGCACGATTTCCCG-3′). Statistical analysis was performed using the Prism4 statistical program. p values are two-tailed and were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test. Error bars represent the standard deviation. To study the effect of HCV on ARE-dependent gene expression reporter gene assays were performed. HCV-replicating cells were transfected with reporter constructs harboring a luciferase reporter gene under the control of NQO1, GI-GPx, or GCLM-derived ARE sequences. Cells transfected with the replication-deficient GND-mutant served as control. In one set of experiments the effect of HCV on the basal expression of ARE-regulated promoters was analyzed, in the other set the effect of HCV on the electrophil (tBHQ)-dependent induction of ARE-regulated genes was studied. The reporter gene assay shows that both HCV constructs, JFH-1wt and JFH1/J6, caused a slight decrease in the basal activation of the reporter genes as compared with the GND-mutant transfected cells (Fig. 1A). In case of the tBHQ-stimulated cells a significantly smaller induction of the reporter genes was found for the HCV-replicating cells as compared with the GND-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). These data were confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using NQO1-specific primers (Fig. 1B) and by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). Both experiments confirmed that expression of NQO1 was much stronger induced after tBHQ treatment in HCV-negative control cells as compared with the HCV-replicating cells. In the latter, only a weak increase in the expression of NQO1 was observed. Comparable results were obtained for GCLM and GI-GPx (data not shown). To corroborate these data we analyzed the expression of Nrf2/ARE-dependent genes in HCV- infected primary human hepatocytes and in liver samples derived from patients with a chronic HCV infection. The real time PCR using GCLC- and GPx-specific primers revealed that in the HCV-infected primary human hepatocytes after tBHQ stimulation significant less GPx and GCLC were expressed as compared with the uninfected cells (Fig. 1D). Real time PCR analyses of liver samples from patients with chronic HCV infection and HCV/HBV-negative samples revealed a decreased expression of GPx and GCLC in the HCV-positive samples as compared with the control (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these data show that HCV exerts an inhibitory effect on the induction of ARE-regulated genes. Based on the results described above we analyzed whether overexpression of ARE-regulated genes affects the HCV replication. The Western blot analysis of cellular lysates derived from HCV-replicating cells overexpressing NQO1 or GCLC revealed that neither overexpression of NQO1 nor of GCLC significantly affects the amount of viral proteins (Fig. 2A). To determine if modulation of ARE-regulated gene expression affects HCV replication, cells were either treated with tBHQ or co-transfected with an expression construct encoding a constitutively active (ca) mutant of Nrf2 or a transdominant negative (tdn) mutant of Nrf2. Western blot analyses demonstrate that neither the induction of ARE-regulated genes by co-expression of caNrf2 nor the inhibition by co-expression of tdnNrf2 affect HCV replication (Fig. 2B). Comparable results were obtained for tBHQ-stimulated cells (data not shown). These data were corroborated when cells that replicate a luciferase reporter virus were co-transfected with pcaNrf2, ptdnNrf2, or treated with tBHQ. The reporter gene assays confirm that neither general activation nor inhibition of the Nrf2/ARE-regulated gene expression directly affects HCV replication (Fig. 2C). Moreover dilution assays for determination of the virus titer confirmed that comparable amounts of infectious viral particles were produced from HCV-replicating cells treated with tBHQ, or transfected with pNQO1, pcaNrf2, or ptdnNrf2 as compared with the corresponding controls (Fig. 2D). The transcription factor Nrf2 plays an essential role in the control of ARE-regulated genes. In its inactive state Nrf2 is associated with Keap1, localized in the cytoplasm, and rapidly degraded. Upon activation, Nrf2 enters the nucleus and binds as a heterodimer with small Maf (sMaf) proteins to the ARE sequences. To study the mechanism underlying the HCV-dependent inhibition of Nrf2/ARE-dependent gene expression we analyzed whether co-expression of caNrf2 can rescue the defect in Nrf2/ARE-regulated gene expression seen in HCV-replicating cells. However, reporter gene assays revealed that coexpression of caNrf2 does not fully rescue Nrf2/ARE-dependent gene expression in HCV-replicating cells as compared with the control (Fig. 3A). Based on this finding we hypothesized that the accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus might be impaired in HCV-replicating cells. To study whether the HCV-dependent inhibition of ARE-regulated genes is due to reduced levels of Nrf2 in the nucleus compared with HCV-negative cells we performed subcellular fractionation (27Sauter D. Himmelsbach K. Kriegs M. Carvajal Yepes M. Hildt E. J. Hepatol. 2009; 50: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) of HCV-positive and HCV-negative cells and determined the amount of Nrf2 in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions by Western blotting. Indeed, levels of nuclear Nrf2 were much higher in tBHQ-treated HCV-negative cells compared with HCV-positive cells (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that less Nrf2 is available for binding to ARE sequences in the nucleus of HCV-replicating cells compared with HCV-negative cells, resulting in a decreased induction of ARE-regulated genes. Small Maf proteins are an essential co-factor regulating Nrf2/ARE-dependent gene expression(14Kensler T.W. Wakabayashi N. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar,15Kensler T.W. Wakabayashi N. Biswal S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 89-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar). In a recent report it was described that overxpression of the sMaf proteins MafG and MafK impairs ARE-mediated gene expression(33Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In light of our data described above we investigated whether the intracellular amounts and/or the distribution of sMaf proteins are affected by HCV. Western blot analyses of cellular lysates derived from HCV-replicating cells revealed significantly higher amounts of sMaf proteins in these cells as compared with the control (Fig. 4A). These data were corroborated by immunohistochemical analysis of consecutive liver sections derived from three HCV-positive patients that gave comparable results. Fig. 4B shows the results obtained for one of these samples at 200- and 400-fold magnification. HCV-positive cells were identified using a core-specific antiserum. The consecutive section was stained using a small Maf-specific antiserum. In the HCV-positive cells we found a much stronger staining of small Maf proteins as compared with the surrounding HCV-negative cells (Fig. 4B). Liver tissue from a HCV-/HBV-negative patient served as control. These data indicate that our in vitro data are indeed relevant for the in vivo situation. For a more detailed analysis, confocal double immunofluorescence microscopy of HCV-positive and HCV-negative control cells was performed. The double immunofluorescence microscopies show that in HCV-negative cells almost all of the small Maf-proteins are found within the nucleus. However, in case of the HCV-positive cells a strong sMaf-specific signal was observed in the perinuclear region, while the nucleus remained unstained or weakly stained (Fig. 4C). This could be confirmed by cell fractionation experiments of HCV-positive cells and HCV-negative cells and subsequent Western blot analyses of the extranuclear (cyt) and nucleosolic fraction. In case of the HCV-negative cells almost all of the SMafs was found in the nucleosolic fraction, while in the extranuclear fraction significant less was found. In case of the subcellular fractions derived from HCV-positive cells comparable amounts of sMafs were found in the extranuclear and nucleosolic fraction (Fig. 4D). These results demonstrate that the levels of sMaf proteins are increased in HCV-positive cells. In addition, sMafs are predominantly localized in the extranuclear compartment of infected cells, whereas their localization is mainly nuclear in control cells. In the next set of experiments we aimed to perform a more detailed analysis of the HCV-dependent delocalization of sMafs. Huh7.5 cells were transfected with various HCV replicon constructs and analyzed with regard to their effect on the subcellular distribution of sMafs and their interference with the Nrf2/ARE-regulated gene expression. First, the effect of the subgenomic replicons Huh 9–13 and HuhEt that lack the structural proteins and encompass the NS3-NS5B proteins were analyzed. The confocal double immunofluorescence microscopy shows that in cells replicating these subgenomic replicons no delocalization of sMafs can be observed (Fig. 5A) indicating that the nonstructural proteins are not sufficient to delocalize sMafs. In accordance with this finding, co-transfection of Huh9–13 cells with an ARE-dependent luc reporter construct revealed that this subgenomic replicon does not exert an inhibitory effect on Nrf2/ARE-dependent gene expression (Fig. 5B). These data suggested that the structural proteins might be causative for sMaf delocalization and the resulting inhibition of Nrf2/ARE-dependent gene expression. In cells replicating the E1/E2-deficient replicon JFH1DE1/E2 the delocalization of sMaf proteins was found indistinguishable from cells replicating the wild-type replicon JFH1 (Fig. 5C). In accordance with this finding, reporter gene experiments showed a comparable inhibition of ARE-dependent gene expression in cells replicating JFH1DE1/E2 or JFH1/J6 (Fig. 5C). Next, the effect of the core-deficient replicon construct JFH1d3C on sMaf delocalization and Nrf2/ARE-dependent gene expression was analyzed. Immunofluorescence microscopy shows no delocalization of sMaf for the core-deficient replicon (Figs. 5D and 6A). Furthermore, no inhibitory effect on the Nrf2/ARE-dependent gene expression was observed using reporter assays (Fig. 5D). However, co-transfection of Huh7.5 cells replicating the core-deficient JFH1d3C construct with a core expression construct restored the inhibitory potential on the Nrf2/ARE-dependent driven reporter gene (Fig. 5D). Surprisingly, the selective overexpression of core in transiently transfected cells neither causes delocalization of sMaf proteins (Fig. 5E) nor impairs Nrf2/ARE-dependent gene expression (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these data indicate that HCV triggers delocalization of small Maf proteins by core that requires the presence of the NS proteins. The resulting question was whether there is a direct interaction of the NS-proteins or of core with sMaf. To address this question, HCV-replicating cells were stained with NS3, core and sMaf-specific antisera and analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The detailed analysis reveals for HCV positive cells a colocalization of NS3 with sMaf that is absent in cells replicating the core deficient mutant (Fig. 5D). Further analysis including staining of lipid droplets revealed that there is no co-localization of sMafs with core (Fig. 6A) but with NS3 (Fig. 6B). The interaction of sMaf with NS3 in HCV-replicating cells could be confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments using cellular lysates derived from HCV-replicating cells obtained 48 or 72 h after electroporation (Fig. 6, C and D). However, coimmunoprecipitation experiments using a core-specific antiserum failed to co-precipitate sMafs and vice versa (Fig. 6E). These experiments revealed that sMafs could be specifically coprecipitated by a NS3-specific antiserum and vice versa (Fig. 6D) but not by a core-specific serum (Fig. 6E). These data suggest that core triggers by an indirect mechanism i.e. by affecting intracellular signal transduction cascades but not by a direct interaction the delocalization of sMafs. In accordance with this, sMafs do not colocalize with core in the cytoplasm but with NS3. This suggests that core results in modification of sMafs or NS3 that are required for their interaction. The expression of some proteasomal subunits is affected by the Nrf2/ARE-system: i.e. the expression of the catalytically active PSMB5 subunit depends on three XRE (xenobiotic response element) and two ARE sequences(25Kwak M.K. Kensler T.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 345: 1350-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Reporter gene experiments using a luciferase reporter gene driven by the complete promoter of PSMB5 (p3,4luc) showed a decreased induction of the reporter gene in HCV-replicating cells as compared with the GND control. To demonstrate the relevance of the ARE sequences for the observed effect, the XRE sequences were deleted. Transfection of HCV-replicating cells with this truncated reporter construct that still harbors the two ARE sequences demonstrated an impaired induction in HCV-replicating cells as compared with the GND control (Fig. 7A). In accordance with this finding, the analysis of the constitutive proteasomal activity revealed a significantly decreased activity for proteasomes isolated from HCV-replicating cells as compared with the control cells (Fig. 7B). Nrf2/ARE-regulated genes play an essential role in the protection of cells against damage by electrophiles and ROI (13Li W. Kong A.N. Mol. Carcinog. 2009; 48: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 14Kensler T.W. Wakabayashi N. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 15Kensler T.W. Wakabayashi N. Biswal S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 89-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar). The observed inhibitory effect of HCV on the induction of Nrf2/ARE-regulated genes suggests an impaired elimination of ROI. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the formation of oxidized proteins by oxyblots and the formation of DNA adducts by measuring 8-OHdG formation. While in case of untreated cells only a slight increase in the amount of oxidized proteins was observed, a significant difference was found when the intracellular levels of ROI were increased by H2O2 or glucose oxidase. In the case of the lysates derived from the HCV-positive cells a significantly elevated level of oxidized proteins was observed as compared with the lysates derived from the GND control (Fig. 7C). In accordance with this finding, a significantly elevated level of 8-OHdG formation was observed in H2O2-treated HCV-replicating cells as compared with the control (Fig. 7D). These data indicate that in HCV-replicating cells the protective mechanisms preventing oxidative damage are impaired. In this study we demonstrate the capacity of HCV to impair the induction of Nrf2/ARE-regulated genes. In a recent report it was shown that an increased amount of small Mafs negatively regulates the expression of Nrf2-ARE-regulated genes(33Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The preferential formation of sMaf homodimers under these conditions and their binding to the ARE despite the presence of sMaf/Nrf2 heterodimers, were considered as causative for the inhibitory effect. Indeed, in case of HCV-replicating cells in vitro and in vivo an increased amount of sMafs is observed. Interestingly, a detailed analysis revealed that in HCV-replicating cells the sMafs are preferentially localized in the perinuclear region. The observed extranuclear localization of sMafs in HCV-replicating cells suggests that the inhibitory effect on ARE-dependent gene expression results from abnormal localization of sMafs and not from their increased expression with subsequent formation of homodimers. In this case sMafs would be localized in the nucleus(13Li W. Kong A.N. Mol. Carcinog. 2009; 48: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The observed delocalization of small Mafs suggests a different mechanism. The subcellular fractionation experiment indicates that in HCV-replicating cells the accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus is impaired. Moreover, reporter gene assays demonstrated that co-expression of caNrf2 does not restore ARE-regulated gene expression to the level of the control cell. These data strongly suggest that the extranuclear sMafs might bind Nrf2 and thereby prevent the entry of Nrf2 into the nucleus. Furthermore, due to their extranuclear localization, the small Maf proteins are not available for the formation of Nrf2/sMaf heterodimers in the nucleus, thereby preventing ARE-regulated gene expression (15Kensler T.W. Wakabayashi N. Biswal S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 89-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar). The observed co-localization of sMafs with NS3 in HCV-replicating cells suggests an interplay between core, sMafs and NS3. There is no evidence for a direct interaction of core with sMafs. Core as regulatory protein (34Spaziani A. Alisi A. Sanna D. Balsano C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Chou A.H. Tsai H.F. Wu Y.Y. Hu C.Y. Hwang L.H. Hsu P.I. Hsu P.N. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2160-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) might trigger intracellular signaling, resulting in posttranslational modification of sMaf and/or NS3 that enables their interaction, resulting in the delocalization of sMaf to the replicon complex. Our data demonstrated that HCV replication is not affected directly by induction or inhibition of Nrf2/ARE-regulated gene expression. Recent reports based on Con1-based or subgenomic replicons, however, demonstrated that strong overexpression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), which resulted in increased biliverdin levels, suppressed HCV replication. The HO-1 product biliverdin triggers the antiviral interferon response and thereby reduces HCV replication (36Zhu Z. Wilson A.T. Mathahs M.M. Wen F. Brown K.E. Luxon B.A. Schmidt W.N. Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 37Lehmann E. El-Tantawy W.H. Ocker M. Bartenschlager R. Lohmann V. Hashemolhosseini S. Tiegs G. Sass G. Hepatology. 2010; 51: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In light of this finding, the HCV-dependent inhibition of Nrf2/ARE-regulated genes, which include the HO-1 gene, could result in decreased biliverdin levels and subsequent stimulation of HCV replication. The HCV-dependent inhibition of Nrf2/ARE-regulated genes could be relevant for the HCV-associated pathogenesis. During the viral life cycle the virus producing cells encounter an increased level of ROI (8Bartosch B. Thimme R. Blum H.E. Zoulim F. J. Hepatol. 2009; 51: 810-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This can be caused i.e. by the immune response or by ER-overload due to the overproduction of viral membrane proteins. Furthermore, the decreased activity of the constitutive proteasome can lead to an impaired elimination of misfolded proteins and thereby induce cellular stress that confers to increased ROI levels (38Oyadomari S. Yun C. Fisher E.A. Kreglinger N. Kreibich G. Oyadomari M. Harding H.P. Goodman A.G. Harant H. Garrison J.L. Taunton J. Katze M.G. Ron D.

Therefore, it may well be that the HCV-dependent inhibition of cytoprotective gene expression results in an impaired detoxification of ROIs. Indeed, oxyblots and analysis of 8-OH-dG formation demonstrated that the elimination of ROIs in HCV-replicating cells is impaired as compared with the control. The elevated ROI level in HCV-replicating cells can affect the genetic integrity of the host cell and thereby contribute to the development of HCC. Apart from this, increased ROI levels could increase the mutation rate of the viral genome and thereby enhance to the genetic variability of the virus. In a recent report it was demonstrated that in Nrf2-deficient mice the process of liver regeneration is impaired due to increased ROI levels that negatively affect insulin/IGF-1 signaling(41Beyer T.A. Xu W. Teupser D. auf dem Keller U. Bugnon P. Hildt E. Thiery J. Kan Y.W. Werner S. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 212-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, the HCV-dependent inhibition of Nrf2/ARE-regulated gene expression could be relevant for the HCV-associated formation of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis due to an inhibitory effect on liver regeneration (42Xu W. Hellerbrand C. Köhler U.A. Bugnon P. Kan Y.W. Werner S. Beyer T.A. Lab. Invest. 2008; 88: 1068-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) activates the Nrf2/ARE-dependent gene expression (43Schaedler S. Krause J. Himmelsbach K. Carvajal-Yepes M. Lieder F. Klingel K. Nassal M. Weiss T.S. Werner S. Hildt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41074-41086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In accordance to this a better elimination of ROI can be observed in HBV-positive cells as compared with the control. Moreover, the HBV-dependent induction of Nrf2/ARE-regulated genes results in an increased activity of the constitutive proteasome that is associated with a decreased activity of the immunoproteasome This might aggravate the elimination of HBV-infected cells. In HCV-replicating cells the decreased activity of the constitutive proteasome is not compensated by an increased activity of the immunoproteasome (data not shown). Taken together, our study revealed a novel mechanism of Nrf2 regulation in virus-infected cells that depends on de-localization of sMaf proteins. The resulting inhibition of Nrf2/ARE-regulated genes might be relevant for the HCV-associated pathogenesis for several reasons: (i) increased ROI levels due to the impaired induction of cytoprotective genes cause DNA-damage in the host cell and could enhance the genetic variability of the viral genome; (ii) elevated ROI levels impair insulin/IGF-1 signaling and thereby negatively affect liver regeneration. In the future it will be interesting to determine if rescue of Nrf2/ARE activity can be therapeutically explored for prevention of HCV-associated pathogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2095806089,"Partitioning of chromosomes into euchromatic and heterochromatic domains requires mechanisms that specify boundaries. The S. pombe JmjC family protein Epe1 prevents the ectopic spread of heterochromatin and is itself concentrated at boundaries. Paradoxically, Epe1 is recruited to heterochromatin by HP1 silencing factors that are distributed throughout heterochromatin. We demonstrate here that the selective enrichment of Epe1 at boundaries requires its regulation by the conserved Cul4-Ddb1Cdt2 ubiquitin ligase, which directly recognizes Epe1 and promotes its polyubiquitylation and degradation. Strikingly, in cells lacking the ligase, Epe1 persists in the body of heterochromatin thereby inducing a defect in gene silencing. Epe1 is the sole target of the Cul4-Ddb1Cdt2 complex whose destruction is necessary for the preservation of heterochromatin. This mechanism acts parallel with phosphorylation of HP1/Swi6 by CK2 to restrict Epe1. We conclude that the ubiquitin-dependent sculpting of the chromosomal distribution of an antisilencing factor is critical for heterochromatin boundaries to form correctly."
https://openalex.org/W2080997081,"L-type calcium currents conducted by CaV1.2 channels initiate excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. In the heart, the distal portion of the C terminus (DCT) is proteolytically processed in vivo and serves as a noncovalently associated autoinhibitor of CaV1.2 channel activity. This autoinhibitory complex, with A-kinase anchoring protein-15 (AKAP15) bound to the DCT, is hypothesized to serve as the substrate for β-adrenergic regulation in the fight-or-flight response. Mice expressing CaV1.2 channels with the distal C terminus deleted (DCT−/−) develop cardiac hypertrophy and die prematurely after E15. Cardiac hypertrophy and survival rate were improved by drug treatments that reduce peripheral vascular resistance and hypertension, consistent with the hypothesis that CaV1.2 hyperactivity in vascular smooth muscle causes hypertension, hypertrophy, and premature death. However, in contrast to expectation, L-type Ca2+ currents in cardiac myocytes from DCT−/− mice were dramatically reduced due to decreased cell-surface expression of CaV1.2 protein, and the voltage dependence of activation and the kinetics of inactivation were altered. CaV1.2 channels in DCT−/− myocytes fail to respond to activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin, and the localized expression of AKAP15 is reduced. Therefore, we conclude that the DCT of CaV1.2 channels is required in vivo for normal vascular regulation, cell-surface expression of CaV1.2 channels in cardiac myocytes, and β-adrenergic stimulation of L-type Ca2+ currents in the heart.

Therefore, we conclude that the DCT of CaV1.2 channels is required in vivo for normal vascular regulation, cell-surface expression of CaV1.2 channels in cardiac myocytes, and β-adrenergic stimulation of L-type Ca2+ currents in the heart. The CaV1.2 channel conducts L-type calcium (Ca2+) current in cardiomyocytes, where Ca2+ enters through the channel and initiates excitation-contraction coupling via Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (1Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Normal expression of CaV1.2 channels is required for cardiac contractile function and for survival beyond embryonic day 14 (2Seisenberger C. Specht V. Welling A. Platzer J. Pfeifer A. Kühbandner S.

In contrast, deletion of CaV1.3, which also conducts L-type Ca2+ currents, causes sinoatrial nodal dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias but does not impair contractility or cause premature death (4Platzer J.

Overall, these gene deletion studies illustrate that L-type Ca2+ currents are essential for normal cardiovascular function and for normal development. CaV1 channels are multisubunit complexes composed of a pore-forming α1 subunit and auxiliary β, α2δ, and in some cases γ subunits (5Striessnig J. Cell. Physiol.

In the “fight-or-flight” response, increased force of contraction is achieved largely through regulation of CaV1.2 channels in the heart by the sympathetic nervous system through activation of β-adrenergic receptors, adenylyl cyclase, and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and resulting phosphorylation of CaV1.2 channels (1Bers D.M.

In cardiac muscle, the α1 subunit of CaV1.2 channels is present in two size forms of ∼240 and 210 kDa, which differ by truncation of the distal C terminus (DCT) (15De Jongh K.S. Murphy B.J.

Mutations of key charged residues at the interface between distal and proximal C-terminal domains of CaV1.2 relieves autoinhibition (18Hulme J.T. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Lin T.W. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Physiol. 2006; 576: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies indicate that regulation of CaV1.2 channels can be reconstituted in transfected nonmuscle cells expressing a signaling complex of truncated CaV1.2, DCT, and AKAP15 (19Fuller M.D. Emrick M.A. Sadilek M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra70Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine the regulatory roles of the DCT in vivo, we created a mouse line expressing only the truncated CaV1.2 channel (CaV1.2ΔDCT) by introducing a premature stop codon at the site of proteolytic cleavage. Mice expressing only truncated CaV1.2 channels developed severe cardiac hypertrophy and died perinatally. Drugs that reduce peripheral vascular resistance improved survival, suggesting that premature death results from failure of vascular regulation. Cell-surface expression of CaV1.2 channels was dramatically reduced in myocytes from embryonic hearts but not in coronary vascular smooth muscle cells. Deletion of the DCT abolished regulation by PKA and reduced localized expression of AKAP15. Overall, our results reveal that the DCT of CaV1.2 channels is required for normal cardiovascular regulation, expression of CaV1.2 channels in cardiac myocytes, and regulation by β-adrenergic stimulation in vivo. The present study conformed to the guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Washington. Animals were maintained under a standard 12:12-h light-dark cycle regime and had ad libitum access to standard chow and water except for specified drug treatments. A mouse line carrying a premature stop codon that results in the expression of the truncated channel was generated by Ingenious Targeting Laboratory (Stony Brook, NY). Approximately 11.5 kb of the Cacna1c gene containing exons 44 through 49 were isolated from a 129SvJ mouse genomic library. A targeting vector was constructed containing 1.1 kb of intronic sequence that extended from a site 0.3 kb upstream of exon 44 as its short arm followed by a 1.9-kb neomycin positive-selection cassette flanked by loxP sites and a 11.2-kb long arm that began at a site 0.3 kb upstream of exon 44 and extended to the NsiI site downstream of exon 49. To truncate the C terminus of CaV1.2 channels after G1796, a three-way stop codon cassette (5′-ctgagtaagta) was ligated into the NcoI site in exon 44 of the targeting construct. An NcoI-linearized targeting construct was transfected into 129Sv/Ev embryonic stem cells by electroporation. Clones were selected and expanded in the presence of G418. PCR analysis was used to identify clones that had undergone homologous recombination. The correctly targeted embryonic stem cell clones were microinjected into C57BL/6J blastocysts (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Germ line transmission of the mutated Cacna1c allele was confirmed for one of three chimeric mice, and the resulting progeny were backcrossed into C57Bl/6J for more than 10 generations to generate heterozygous (Het) and homozygous CaV1.2ΔDCT (KO) animals used in this study. Wild-type (WT) and mutant animals were identified by PCR analysis of tail-tip DNA using primers FH258 (CCCACTGCACATCAACAAGAC) and FH254 (GTCCTGTGTGGAAGACTCAAGGAG). The amplified product was further digested by NcoI, which gives a single band at 702 bp for the WT allele and at 908 bp for the mutated allele due to elimination of the NcoI restriction site in exon 44. Heterozygotes (DCT+/−, Het) were used to generate DCT−/− (KO) mice that only express CaV1.2ΔDCT. Pregnant Het female mice were sacrificed at gestational day 16–18. Embryos were removed by Cesarean section, and a tail sample was used for PCR analysis for genotyping. Due to the embryonic lethality of KO mice, a series of drugs were administered during the last week of gestation to prolong survival. Isradipine (1 or 3 mg/kg) and cyclosporin A (50 mg/kg) were administered via daily subcutaneous injections to pregnant female mice starting at E13. Tadalafil (0.5 μg/ml) and captopril (200 mg/liter) were given via drinking water from E13 to E18. Hearts were dissected and blotted dry for weight measurement to evaluate hypertrophy. Embryos at E18 were dissected after Cesarean section. The thoracic cavity was opened, and the atria were removed for better visualization of the ductus arteriosus. Ink was injected into the right ventricle and visualized under a dissection microscope. Embryonic cardiomyocytes were isolated similarly to Davies et al. (20Davies M.P. An R.H. Doevendans P. Kubalak S. Chien K.R. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Atria were separated from the heart. The ventricles were cut into small pieces with a razor blade and transferred to ADS buffer containing 5 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 5 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4 (pH 7.35). After a short centrifugation, the buffer was replaced with ADS containing 0.5 mg/ml Collagenase II (Worthington Biochemical). The tissue blocks were digested for two 20-min cycles at 37 °C on a rotating plate followed by gentle trituration. After a quick centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a tissue culture dish or plated on laminin-treated glass coverslips. Cells were cultured in 37 °C in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and used within 48 h after isolation for electrophysiological measurements. Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected by sinking in 30% (w/v) sucrose in 0.1 m sodium phosphate at 4 °C for 72 h. Tissues were cut into 80-μm coronal sections and mounted on subbed slides for hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunocytochemistry. As described previously (21Hulme J.T. Westenbroek R.E. Scheuer T.

Mouse monoclonal antibody (CaV1.2m, clone L57/46) against the proximal C terminus of CaV1.2 channels was purchased from UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility. Polyclonal anti-CaV1.2 (anti-CNC1) and anti-CaV1.3 (anti-CND1) were generated against amino acid sequences in the intracellular loop betweens domains II and III of CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels (22Snutch T.P.

The whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was used to record Ca2+ currents from embryonic ventricular myocytes isolated at E16-E18. Currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Data acquisition and command potentials were controlled by Pulse software (Heka Electronics), and data were stored for later analysis with IGOR (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Residual leak and capacitive transients were subtracted using a P/4 protocol. The extracellular bath solution contained 140 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm BaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4). The intracellular solution contained 100 mm CsCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MgATP, 10 mm Hepes, and 10 mm EGTA (pH 7.3). Control and forskolin-containing medium was rapidly perfused from a gravity-fed system. Cells were held at −40 mV to inactivate T-type Ca2+ channels and Na+ channels, and 100-ms test pulses were applied from −40 to +40 mV in 10-mV increments. Peak Ba2+ current amplitude was plotted versus voltage to generate current-voltage (I-V) relationships. To measure the voltage dependence of activation, tail currents were recorded after repolarization to −50 mV after test pulses from the holding potential to potentials from −50 to +150 mV in 10-mV increments. To measure inactivation kinetics, Ba2+ current was recorded after a series of 1-s depolarizations from the holding potential of −40 mV to potentials from 0 to +30 mV in 10-mV increments. The results were normalized to peak Ba2+ current amplitude recorded at +10 mV. For analysis of inactivation kinetics, individual data traces were smoothed using a binomial algorithm with an interval of 20 points. Gating-charge movement was measured by applying a series of test pulses at 10-s intervals from a holding potential of −40 mV to potentials between +60 to +80 mV in 2-mV increments and integrating the gating charge movement at the reversal potential for the ionic currents (18Hulme J.T. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Lin T.W. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Physiol. 2006; 576: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes (2–4 megaohms) were pulled from micropipette glass and fire-polished before use. Recordings were discarded if the series resistance was >7 megaohms before compensation. All experiments were performed at room temperature. For analysis of fluorescence intensity of CaV1.2 channels and AKAP15, whole regions of interest were taken from the images, and mean pixel intensities were determined. Total RNA was extracted from whole hearts of WT, Het, and KO embryos. CaV1.2 mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR using fluorescent SYBR Green technology on a StepOnePlus system (Applied Biosystems). Standard curves were constructed from cDNA standards, and the results were normalized by expression as a molar ratio to acidic ribosomal protein. All of the data are reported as the means ± S.E. One-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni posttest (GraphPad Prism 4.0) was used to compare the averages from multiple groups. A mouse line expressing the truncated CaV1.2 channel was generated by introducing a premature stop codon at G1796 (Fig. 1A). Genotype was determined by loss of a NcoI restriction site (Fig. 1, B–D). Germ line transmission was confirmed using RT-PCR with different primer pairs (Fig. 1E). When probed with an anti-CaV1.2 antibody that recognizes an epitope in the intracellular loop connecting domains II and III, sections from hearts of E16 WT and KO mice had easily detectable levels of CaV1.2 channels (Fig. 1F). In contrast, no signal was detected using an antibody against the truncated distal C terminus in DCT−/− heart, confirming successful deletion of the DCT. Two unexpected splice variants with short extensions of 3 and 12 residues beyond G1796 were identified (Fig. 1D). mRNA encoding the truncated CaV1.2 channel with the 12-amino acid extension was most abundant. However, this 12-residue extension has no effect on expression and function of the truncated CaV1.2 channel in transfected tsA-201 embryonic kidney cells (Fig. 1, G and H). Heterozygous CaV1.2ΔDCT mice containing one truncated allele show no distinguishable phenotypic differences from WT littermates, whereas no homozygous mice were found at weaning. Further analysis revealed that DCT−/− mice died shortly after birth, usually within a few hours. No survival was observed after 24 h. To determine the timeline of death of DCT−/− mice, we examined the genotype distribution during embryonic development from E13 to E18. Live DCT−/− embryos were found at a lower than expected Mendelian ratio (Fig. 2A, p < 0.01). Death of DCT−/− embryos occurred as early as E15 and throughout the later gestational stage until birth. These results indicate that regulation of the CaV1.2 channel by its DCT is required for normal embryonic development in vivo. Significant abdominal blood pooling was observed in all dead DCT−/− embryos and pups collected after birth (Fig. 2A), a hallmark feature of congestive heart failure. No other difference in gross structure or morphology was observed between WT and DCT−/− embryos. DCT−/−embryos had an ∼31% increase in heart weight to body weight ratio compared with WT (Fig. 2C, 5.5 ± 0.2 versus 4.2 ± 0.1 mg/g, p < 0.001), indicating severe cardiac hypertrophy. Unlike the left ventricular hypertrophy observed in humans and animal models of heart failure, the hypertrophy in DCT−/− embryos occurs preferentially in the right ventricle as shown in Fig. 2B. Enlarged hearts were observed in all dead DCT−/− embryos and pups. Further histological analysis with hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrated significant concentric hypertrophy in the right ventricular chamber (Fig. 2B), which would limit the diastolic volume and thereby impair contractile function and pumping capacity. Therefore, the right ventricular hypertrophy we have observed may cause impaired pumping capacity and pooling of blood in internal organs such as the gastrointestinal track and liver, contributing to heart failure and death of DCT−/− mice. Membrane capacitance is proportional to cell surface area, providing a quantitative estimate of cell size. Dissociated myocytes from DCT−/− mice have a shift in distribution of cell-surface area, with fewer myocytes having single-cell capacitances of 20–25 picofarads and more myocytes having capacitances of 30–35 picofarads (Fig. 2D). Hypertrophied myocytes often appeared larger in cell culture and typically expressed lower levels of CaV1.2 channels in cytoplasm and plasma membrane in immunocytochemical images (Fig. 2E). Overall, these results indicate that truncation of CaV1.2 channels leads to hypertrophy of individual cardiac myocytes, which increases the size and impairs the function of the right ventricle. The preferential hypertrophy of right ventricle prompted us to investigate whether the ductus arteriosus remains patent in DCT−/− embryos. The ductus arteriosus is a specialized vascular structure for fetal circulation that connects the pulmonary trunk to the descending aorta and allows shunting of 95% of the blood away from the high resistance pulmonary vasculature. Because of this shunt, the right ventricle plays a much more important role in pumping blood to the peripheral circulation compared with adult heart. Premature closure of the ductus arteriosus results in cardiac hypertrophy and right-sided heart failure (26Toyoshima K. Momma K. Imamura S. Nakanishi T. Biol. Neonate. 2006; 89: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We examined live DCT−/− embryos, all of which show enlarged right ventricles but no closure of the ductus arteriosus (Fig. 3A). These results rule out anatomical closure of the ductus arteriosus as the cause of hypertrophy in DCT−/− mice, but it remains possible that increased contracture of the ductus arteriosus could contribute to right ventricular hypertrophy in DCT−/− mice. Based on our in vitro data (18Hulme J.T. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Lin T.W. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Physiol. 2006; 576: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we expected that truncation of the DCT would lead to up-regulation of CaV1.2 channel activity in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells, and this increased activity could lead to increased peripheral vascular resistance, hypertension, and heart failure. Human hypertension is treated with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, which preferentially inhibit CaV1.2 channels in vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo (27Brogden R.N. Sorkin E.M. Drugs. 1995; 49: 618-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Schachter M. J. Clin. Pharm. Ther. 1991; 16: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The calcium channel antagonist isradipine (1 and 3 mg/kg) reduced the heart to body weight ratio significantly and increased survival of DCT−/− embryos assayed at E18 (Fig. 3, B and C). This effect was dose-dependent, but no further improvement was observed at 10 mg/kg. This result suggests the possibility that overactive Ca2+ channels in vascular smooth muscle are responsible for hypertrophy and premature death in DCT−/− mice. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the most widely used treatment for human hypertension. We found that captopril plus isradipine did not substantially improve heart weight or survival compared with isradipine alone (Fig. 3, B and C). The specific cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor tadalafil is an effective treatment for pulmonary hypertension in humans, and it has also been shown to inhibit PDE5 in ductus arteriosus and cause dilation of the shunt in the fetus (29Momma K. Toyoshima K. Imamura S. Nakanishi T. Pediatr. Res. 2005; 58: 42-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Tadalafil was approximately as effective as isradipine in reducing heart weight and premature death when given alone, but the combined effects of tadalafil and isradipine were not greater than isradipine alone (Fig. 3, B and C). These results suggested that increased vascular resistance due to overactive Ca2+ channels contributes significantly to the development of cardiac hypertrophy and thereby to premature death of DCT−/− animals during embryonic development. To test whether the cardiac hypertrophy per se results in the death of DCT−/− embryos, we used the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A, which counteracts the effects of alterations in Ca2+ signaling and effectively protects the heart from cardiac hypertrophy (30Luo Z. Shyu K.G. Gualberto A. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1092-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Sussman M.A. Lim H.W. Gude N. Taigen T. Olson E.N. Robbins J. Colbert M.C. Gualberto A.

Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). Treatment with cyclosporin A almost completely prevented hypertrophy in DCT−/− embryos (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, however, the survival ratio of DCT−/− embryos did not change (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that cardiac hypertrophy per se is not the primary cause of premature death of DCT−/− embryos and point to increased contracture of vascular smooth muscle in resistance vessels and resulting hypertension as a primary cardiovascular defect that causes premature death in DCT−/− mice. Even though treatment with isradipine, captopril, and tadalafil improved the survival of DCT−/− embryos to E18, none of them increased the number of pups surviving to weaning. The combination of captopril and isradipine was the most effective treatment, supporting survival to postnatal day 4 for a small fraction of DCT−/− pups. All other treatments failed to improve postnatal survival beyond 24 h. Using the whole-cell voltage clamp technique, we examined L-type Ca2+ current in acutely dissociated embryonic cardiomyocytes. Current amplitude in WT myocytes is very small, even with 3.6 mm extracellular Ca. Therefore, 20 mm Ba2+ was used as the charge carrier to achieve a better signal-to-noise ratio. L-type Ba2+ current amplitude (Fig. 4, A and B) is dramatically reduced in cells of DCT−/− mice compared with those of WT and Het. At a holding potential of −40 mV, which inactivates Na+ current and T-type Ca2+ current, 10 μm isradipine completely blocked Ba2+ current in both WT and DCT−/− cells, indicating that the dihydrop"

Caspases play a central role in apoptosis; however, their involvement in mitochondrial dysfunction-induced neuronal apoptosis remains elusive. In the present report using rotenone, a complex I inhibitor that causes mitochondrial dysfunction, we determined the initiator caspase and its role in cell death in primary cultures of cortical neurons from young adult mice (1-2 months old). By pretreating the cells with a cell-permeable, biotinylated pan-caspase inhibitor that irreversibly binds to and traps the active caspase, we identified caspase-2 as an initiator caspase activated in rotenone-treated primary neurons. Loss of caspase-2 inhibited rotenone-induced apoptosis; however, these neurons underwent a delayed cell death by necrosis. We further found that caspase-2 acts upstream of mitochondria to mediate rotenone-induced apoptosis in neurons. The loss of caspase-2 significantly inhibited rotenone-induced activation of Bid and Bax and the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor from mitochondria. Rotenone-induced downstream activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were also inhibited in the neurons lacking caspase-2. Autophagy was enhanced in caspase-2 knock-out neurons after rotenone treatment, and this response was important in prolonging neuronal survival. In summary, the present study identifies a novel function of caspase-2 in mitochondrial oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in neurons cultured from young adult mice."

When the folding capacity of the ER is exceeded, under pathological and/or physiological conditions, unfolded/misfolded proteins accumulate and lead to ER stress (7Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). β cells use adaptive mechanisms to mitigate ER stress collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (8Kaufman R.J.

UPR is triggered by transmembrane sensors that detect unfolded proteins in the ER through their luminal domain and convey information through their cytosolic domain.

On the other hand, TCPTP knock-out mice die a few weeks after birth due to defects in the hematopoietic compartment (14You-Ten K.E. Muise E.S. Itié A. Michaliszyn E. Wagner J. Jothy S. Lapp W.S. Tremblay M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In addition, TCPTP has been implicated in the regulation of insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis (15Galic S. Klingler-Hoffmann M. Fodero-Tavoletti M.T. Puryer M.A. Meng T.C. Tonks N.K. Tiganis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2096-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 16Fukushima A. Loh K. Galic S. Fam B. Shields B. Wiede F. Tremblay M.L. Watt M.J. Andrikopoulos S. Tiganis T. Diabetes. 2010; 59: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, PTP1B and TCPTP play nonredundant roles in macrophage development and IFN-γ signaling (17Heinonen K.M. Bourdeau A. Doody K.M. Tremblay M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9368-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and function in a coordinated and temporally distinct manner to regulate insulin receptor signaling (18Galic S. Hauser C. Kahn B.B. Haj F.G. Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Tiganis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The roles of TCPTP and PTP1B in modulating ER stress in the endocrine pancreas remain largely unexplored. TCPTP has been recently identified as a candidate gene for type 1 diabetes, and its inhibition exacerbates cytokine-induced pancreatic β cell apoptosis (19Moore F. Colli M.L. Cnop M. Esteve M.I. Cardozo A.K. Cunha D.A. Bugliani M. Marchetti P. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PTP1B deficiency has been shown to spare islets and delay the onset of diabetes in insulin receptor substrate 2 knock-out mice, pointing toward PTP1B having an integral role in regulating β cell homeostasis in vivo (20Kushner J.A. Haj F.G. Klaman L.D. Dow M.A. Kahn B.B. Neel B.G. White M.F. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, PTP1B has been reported to regulate ER stress signaling. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking PTP1B exhibit impaired IRE1α signaling and attenuated ER stress-induced apoptosis (21Gu F. Nguyên D.T. Stuible M. Dubé N. Tremblay M.L. Chevet E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49689-49693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), whereas liver-specific PTP1B deficiency protects mice against HFD-induced ER stress (22Delibegovic M. Zimmer D. Kauffman C. Rak K. Hong E.G. Cho Y.R. Kim J.K. Kahn B.B. Neel B.G. Bence K.K. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined the role of PTP1B and TCPTP in ER stress signaling in β cells. DMEM, penicillin/streptomycin, puromycin, FBS, and trypsin were purchased from Invitrogen. Antibodies used in this study (source, species, and conditions for use) are listed in supplemental Table S1. c-Src Y527F-pJ3Ω and c-Src WT-pJ3Ω have been described previously (41van Vliet C. Bukczynska P.E. Puryer M.A. Sadek C.M. Shields B.J. Tremblay M.L. Tiganis T. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, chemicals were purchased from Sigma. All mice studied were age-matched males on a mixed 129Sv/J × C57Bl/6J background and were maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle with free access to water and food. Mice were placed on standard lab chow (Purina lab chow, no. 5001) at weaning or switched to a HFD (60% kcal from fat, no. D12492, Research Diets) at 5–8 weeks of age. All mouse studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of California, Davis. MIN6 β cells were maintained in DMEM containing 25 millimolar glucose, 15% FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. PTP1B and TCPTP silencing was achieved by testing five different hairpins for each PTP (Open Biosystems). Packaging (psPAX2) and envelope (pMD2.G) vectors were obtained from Addgene (Boston). Lentiviruses were generated by co-transfection of vectors in HEK293FT cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's guidelines and then used to infect MIN6 cells. Cells were selected using puromycin (2 μg/ml), and drug-resistant pools were propagated. Cells with knockdown (KD) of PTP1B or TCPTP were reconstituted by transient transfection of pWZL human PTP1B (hPTP1B) and pCG mouse TCPTP, respectively. For overexpression studies, MIN6 cells were transfected with hPTP1B and then selected with hygromycin (Sigma) as we described previously (23Haj F.G. Markova B. Klaman L.D. Bohmer F.D. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 739-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To induce ER stress, cells (2.5 × 105 cells/60-mm plate) were treated with 1 mm palmitate or 2 ng/ml tunicamycin for 24 h. Palmitate was freshly prepared in HEPES/DMEM buffer containing 10.5% fatty acid-free BSA. For immunohistochemistry, pancreases were fixed in Z-fix (Fisher Scientific) and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with insulin, mouse PTP1B and TCPTP antibodies, and DAPI (nuclear staining). Detection was performed with appropriate fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using a Leica DMI3000B inverted microscope. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% IGEPAL® CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors) as we described previously (24Haj F.G. Zabolotny J.M. Kim Y.B. Kahn B.B. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15038-15046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Pierce Chemical). Proteins (30–90 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Immunoblotting of cell lysates was performed with primary antibodies, and after incubation with secondary antibodies, proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Pixel intensities of immunoreactive bands were quantified using FluorChem Q Imaging software (Alpha Innotech). After treatment with palmitate or tunicamycin for 24 h, MIN6 cells were washed with PBS then stained with 50 μg/ml Hoechst for 15 min. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and visualized using a Leica DMI3000B microscope, and at least 200 cells were counted for each condition. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. All statistical analyses with the JMP program (SAS Institute) were performed using unpaired, two-tail Student's t tests. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05 and highly significant at p ≤ 0.01. A single symbol (such as an asterisk) corresponds to p ≤ 0.05, whereas a double symbol (such as double asterisks) corresponds to p ≤ 0.01. To assess PTP1B and TCPTP localization in the endocrine pancreas, we stained pancreatic sections from wild type mice for either PTP1B or TCPTP and insulin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both phosphatases exhibited stronger expression in insulin-positive islets than in the surrounding exocrine tissue (Fig. 1A). PTP1B staining was exclusively cytosolic consistent with its ER localization (25Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), whereas TCPTP was predominantly nuclear in line with the major murine isoform of TCPTP being the 45-kDa form (26Mosinger Jr., B. Tillmann U. Westphal H. Tremblay M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This isoform of TCPTP is targeted to the nucleus by a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (27Tiganis T. Flint A.J. Adam S.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) but readily shuttles in and out of the nucleus and has access to both nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates (28Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we evaluated PTP1B and TCPTP expression in pancreases of mice fed a normal chow diet (Purina lab chow) versus mice fed a HFD (60% kcal from fat) for 22 weeks to induce chronic ER stress. Because PERK is highly expressed in pancreatic islets (29Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R. An J. Liang J. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7499-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the PERK/eIF2α sub-pathway is important for ER stress signaling in β cells (30Harding H.P. Zeng H. Zhang Y. Jungries R. Chung P. Plesken H. Sabatini D.D. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 31Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), this pathway was used as readout for ER stress. In addition, the status of downstream markers such as XBP1, which regulates the transcription of a number of genes, provided further readout of ER stress signaling. Consistent with published data (32Matveyenko A.V. Gurlo T. Daval M. Butler A.E. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 906-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), high fat feeding led to elevated ER stress in the pancreas. Immunoblot analysis of pancreatic lysates indicated that PERK (Thr980) and eIF2α (Ser51) phosphorylation was increased in mice on a HFD (Fig. 1B). In addition, BiP and sXBP1 expression was increased in pancreases of mice on a HFD compared with those on chow. Importantly, pancreatic PTP1B expression was increased, whereas TCPTP expression was decreased after high fat feeding (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether ER stress also leads to comparable alterations in PTP1B and TCPTP expression, we treated the glucose-responsive insulinoma MIN6 β cells (33Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar) with palmitate. This led to increased BiP expression and PERK (Thr980) phosphorylation within 48 h of treatment (Fig. 1C and data not shown). Notably, prolonged treatment with palmitate (≥48 h) resulted in increased PTP1B and concomitant decreased TCPTP protein levels. Taken together, these results indicate that ER stress induces alterations in PTP1B and TCPTP expression in β cells in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, these results identify MIN6 β cells as a model cell system for the assessment of PTP1B and TCPTP function in ER stress. The increased PTP1B and decreased TCPTP expression in response to ER stress raised the possibility that these phosphatases may play an important role in regulating the ER stress response in islets. To test this, we either overexpressed PTP1B in MIN6 β cells (Fig. 2A) or stably knocked down TCPTP using lentiviral shRNAs (Fig. 2C). As a complementary approach for assessing PTP1B's role in ER stress signaling we also knocked down PTP1B expression (Fig. 2E); there was no compensatory increase in TCPTP expression after PTP1B KD and vice versa (data not shown). To rule out off-target effects, KD cells were reconstituted (KDR) with the respective phosphatase at levels comparable to those in control cells (Fig. 2, C and E). ER stress was induced using palmitate or tunicamycin as described previously (34Hellemans K.H. Hannaert J.C. Denys B. Steffensen K.R. Raemdonck C. Martens G.A. Van Veldhoven P.P. Gustafsson J.A. Pipeleers D. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Palmitate induces ER stress through degradation of carboxypeptidase E (35Jeffrey K.D. Alejandro E.U. Luciani D.S. Kalynyak T.B. Hu X. Li H. Lin Y. Townsend R.R. Polonsky K.S. Johnson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8452-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), whereas tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, inhibits dolichol pyrophosphate-mediated glycosylation of asparaginyl residues of glycoproteins (36Nair S. Xu C. Shen G. Hebbar V. Gopalakrishnan A. Hu R. Jain M.R. Liew C. Chan J.Y. Kong A.N. Toxicol. Lett. 2007; 168: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because glucose concentration affects ER stress in β cells (37Bachar E. Ariav Y. Ketzinel-Gilad M. Cerasi E. Kaiser N. Leibowitz G. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we performed these studies under low and high glucose conditions. MIN6 cells were treated with palmitate or tunicamycin for 24 h, so that PTP1B and TCPTP levels were not altered and overt cell loss due to cell death was not evident (data not shown). The effects of PTP1B overexpression in MIN6 cells on the PERK/eIF2α arm of ER stress signaling were evaluated. In accordance with previous studies (10Eizirik D.L. Cardozo A.K. Cnop M. Endocr. Rev. 2008; 29: 42-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 38Lai E. Bikopoulos G. Wheeler M.B. Rozakis-Adcock M. Volchuk A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 294: E540-E550Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), palmitate and tunicamycin induced ER stress as evidenced by enhanced PERK (Thr980) and eIF2α (Ser51) phosphorylation and increased BiP and sXBP1 expression in control cells after treatment with either drug (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). PTP1B overexpression (∼4–5-fold) led to significant decrease in palmitate- and tunicamycin-induced PERK and eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B). TCPTP knockdown also mitigated palmitate- and tunicamycin-induced ER stress and led to decreased PERK (Thr980) and eIF2α (Ser phosphorylation and decreased BiP and sXBP1 expression when compared with controls, and this could reversed by TCPTP reconstitution (Fig. 2, C and D and supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Conversely, PTP1B deficiency potentiated ER stress as assessed by PERK and eIF2α phosphorylation and BiP and sXBP1 expression, and this was partly reversed by the reconstitution of PTP1B (Fig. 2, E and F, and supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). In accordance with these biochemical findings, real-time PCR revealed that PTP1B deficiency increased BiP, CHOP, and sXBP1 mRNA expression, whereas TCPTP deficiency decreased expression (data not shown). Taken together, our data provide evidence for PTP1B and TCPTP regulating ER stress signaling in MIN6 cells. Moreover, they suggest that the concomitant increase in PTP1B and decrease in TCPTP protein levels in the pancreases of HFD fed mice may function in concert for the mitigation of ER stress signaling. Our studies indicate that PTP1B and TCPTP function coordinately to regulate ER stress signaling in β cells. Previous studies have established the capacity for these two phosphatases to differentially contribute to the regulation of Src family kinases (SFKs). PTP1B dephosphorylates the inhibitory C-terminal c-Src Tyr527 phosphorylation site to activate c-Src (39Bjorge J.D. Pang A. Fujita D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41439-41446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 40Cheng A. Bal G.S. Kennedy B.P. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25848-25855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas TCPTP dephosphorylates the tyrosine kinase activation loop Tyr416 site to inactivate c-Src (41van Vliet C. Bukczynska P.E. Puryer M.A. Sadek C.M. Shields B.J. Tremblay M.L. Tiganis T. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The numbering in our article refers to the prototypical chicken c-Src sequence (Tyr527 in chicken c-Src; Tyr529 in mammalian c-Src, and Tyr416 in chicken c-Src; and Tyr418 in mammalian c-Src). Accordingly, we reasoned that the increased PTP1B and decreased TCPTP protein levels in response to ER stress in vivo might serve to activate SFKs. As a first step toward assessing this possibility, we assessed the activation status of SFKs in pancreatic lysates in response to ER stress using SFK Tyr527 and Tyr416 phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Moreover, we monitored the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the SFK substrate STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) using antibodies specific for the STAT3 Tyr705 site as an additional measure of SFK activation. SFK Tyr416 and STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation were dramatically increased in pancreatic lysates of mice on a HFD as compared with those on chow (Fig. 3, A and B). Next, we assessed the impact of overexpressing PTP1B versus knocking down TCPTP in MIN6 cells on palmitate-induced SFK signaling. For these studies, MIN6 cells were treated with palmitate for 24 h, a condition that promotes ER stress but does not elicit changes in PTP1B and TCPTP levels. Overexpression of PTP1B enhanced SFK activation, as monitored by Tyr416 phosphorylation and the downstream phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 3, C and D). Similarly, TCPTP knockdown increased SFK and STAT3 activation and TCPTP reconstitution reversed this (Fig. 3, E and F). On the other hand, PTP1B knockdown decreased SFK and STAT3 activation (Fig. 3, G and H). Comparable results were observed using tunicamycin (supplemental Fig. S2). Taken together, these results indicate that ER stress-induced changes in PTP1B and TCPTP protein levels may serve to promote SFK signaling. To determine whether the activation of SFKs associated with changes in PTP1B and TCPTP levels after prolonged ER stress might in turn impact on ER stress signaling, we treated TCPTP KD cells with SFK inhibitors PP2 (42Dalgarno D. Stehle T. Narula S. Schelling P. van Schravendijk M.R. Adams S. Andrade L. Keats J. Ram M. Jin L. Grossman T. MacNeil I. Metcalf 3rd, C. Shakespeare W. Wang Y. Keenan T. Sundaramoorthi R. Bohacek R. Weigele M. Sawyer T. Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2006; 67: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or SU6656 (43Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SFK activation in TCPTP KD cells, as assessed using Tyr416 phosphorylation-specific antibodies, was significantly reduced after treatment with PP2 (Fig. 4). Comparable results were obtained in cells treated with SU6566 (supplemental Fig. S3). Treatment of TCPTP KD cells with PP2 or SU6566 attenuated the protective effect of TCPTP deficiency on palmitate- and tunicamycin-induced ER stress; TCPTP KD cells treated with PP2 or SU6566 exhibited increased PERK and eIF2α phosphorylation and elevated BiP and caspase-3 expression (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig S3, A and B). Treatment of PTP1B KD cells with PP2 or SU6566 did not lead to significant alterations in PERK and eIF2α phosphorylation and expression of BiP and caspase-3 consistent with the decreased Src activity in these cells (data not shown). Moreover, expression of constitutively active mutant c-Src Y527F in PTP1B KD cells significantly mitigated palmitate- and tunicamycin-induced ER stress, as well as BiP and caspase-3 expression compared with PTP1B KD cells expressing c-Src wild type (Fig. 4, C and D). Taken together, these findings indicate that PTP1B and TCPTP differentially regulate SFK activation in the context of ER stress. Moreover, these results indicate that alterations in PTP1B and TCPTP protein levels in response to prolonged or chronic ER stress might serve to activate SFK signaling for the attenuation of pancreatic ER stress. ER stress is deployed by β cells to cope with nutrient-induced changes in protein synthesis and to balance newly synthesized protein load against the ER protein-folding capacity. However, excessive ER stress leads to cell death through mitochondrial-dependent and -independent pathways. To investigate the regulation of ER stress-induced apoptotic signaling by TCPTP and PTP1B, we evaluated the expression of proteins that mediate cell death in response to ER stress. p53 has been implicated in palmitate- and tunicamycin-induced apoptosis (44Li J. Lee B. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7260-7270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 45Lovis P. Roggli E. Laybutt D.R. Gattesco S. Yang J.Y. Widmann C. Abderrahmani A. Regazzi R. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 2728-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Once activated, p53 can transactivate genes such as Bax, which regulates downstream caspase-mediated apoptosis (46Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J.G. Craig C.G. Robertson G.S. Nicholson D.W. Park D.S. Slack R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7860-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TCPTP knockdown in MIN6 cells led to decreased expression of p53 and Bax and a decreased Bax/Bcl-xL ratio when compared with controls (Fig. 5A), whereas PTP1B knockdown led to increased expression of p53 and Bax and an increased Bax/Bcl-xL ratio (Fig. 5B). Comparable results were observed using tunicamycin (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). Caspase-3, -7, -9, and -12 are involved in ER stress-induced cell death (47Dahmer M.K. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 80: 576-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After exposure to apoptotic stimuli, cells activate initiator caspases (such as caspase-8 and -9) that proteolytically cleave and activate effector caspases (such as caspase-3 and -7) to dismantle dying cells (48Fischer U. Jänicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we next assessed ER stress-induced expression of initiator and effector Caspases in control versus TCPTP or PTP1B KD and their respective KDR cells. TCPTP knockdown significantly decreased the expression of active caspase-8, -9, -3, and -7 in response to palmitate- or tunicamycin-induced ER stress (Fig. 5C and supplemental Fig. S4C). Conversely, PTP1B deficiency led to significantly increased the expression of active caspase-8, -9, -3, and -7 compared with controls (Fig. 5D; supplemental Fig. S4D). To evaluate the contributions of PTP1B and TCPTP on ER stress-induced cell death directly, we monitored palmitate-induced chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (using Hoechst staining). In control cells cultured in high and low glucose media, apoptosis increased by 26 and 34%, respectively, after palmitate treatment (Fig. 6, A and B). In line with our biochemical observations, TCPTP knockdown significantly reduced apoptosis under high (20%) and low (27%) glucose conditions, whereas PTP1B knockdown increased palmitate-induced apoptosis under high (55%) and low (64%) glucose conditions (Fig. 6, A and B). Finally, to determine the potential for altered PTP1B/TCPTP levels and elevated SFK signaling to impact on cell survival under conditions of chronic ER stress, we assessed the consequence of inhibiting SFKs on palmitate-induced ER stress signaling and cell death in TCPTP KD cells. The inhibition of SFKs with PP2 in TCPTP KD cells resulted in a significant enhancement in palmitate-induced ER stress signaling as shown previously. This in turn coincided with a significant increase in palmitate-induced effector caspase-3 expression and a significant increase in ER stress-induced cell death (Fig. 6, A and B). These results indicate that PTP1B-deficient MIN6 cells are susceptible to ER stress-induced apoptosis, whereas TCPTP-deficient cells are resistant. Moreover, these results suggest that activation of SFKs following a period of prolonged ER stress might serve to protect cells against ER stress-induced apoptosis. The role of PTP1B and TCPTP in regulating ER stress signaling in β cells has heretofore remained largely unexplored. We demonstrate expression of these phosphatases in the endocrine pancreas and reveal differential expression in response to ER stress in pancreas and MIN6 β cells. Our findings establish PTP1B and TCPTP as key regulators of PERK/eIF2α arm of ER stress signaling sub-pathway. This arm of ER stress signaling is critical for the UPR in pancreatic islets. Indeed, PERK knock-out mice exhibit progressive loss of β cells and develop diabetes a few weeks after birth (30Harding H.P. Zeng H. Zhang Y. Jungries R. Chung P. Plesken H. Sabatini D.D. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). In addition, homozygous eIF2α S51A (the residue that is phosphorylated by all eIF2α kinases) knock-in mice exhibit more severe dysfunction of β cells compared with PERK knock-outs (31Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Together, our findings reveal that the regulated expression of pancreatic PTP1B and TCPTP in response to high fat feeding, and potentially other challenges, modulates PERK/eIF2α signaling and presents an adaptive mechanism to mitigate ER stress. Differential regulation of ER stress in MIN6 β cells by PTP1B and TCPTP is due, at least in part, to the opposing effects of these phosphatases on SFKs activation. Our observations are in line with previously proposed roles for these phosphatases. PTP1B activates c-Src by dephophorylating Tyr527 (39Bjorge J.D. Pang A. Fujita D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41439-41446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 40Cheng A. Bal G.S. Kennedy B.P. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25848-25855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas TCPTP inactivates c-Src by dephosporylating Tyr416 (41van Vliet C. Bukczynska P.E. Puryer M.A. Sadek C.M. Shields B.J. Tremblay M.L. Tiganis T. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Consistent with published observations, knockdown of PTP1B in MIN6 cells led to increased Tyr527 phosphorylation (SFK inactivation), whereas TCPTP knockdown led to increased Tyr416 phosphorylation (SFK activation). Importantly, in TCPTP KD cells, the increased SFK activation correlated with decreased ER stress response and pharmacological inhibition of SFKs (using PP2 and SU6656) resulted in increased ER stress. In addition, expression of constitutively active mutant c-Src in PTP1B KD cells significantly mitigated ER stress. These findings are in line with emerging evidence that implicate SFKs in ER stress. Ulianich et al. (49Ulianich L. Garbi C. Treglia A.S. Punzi D. Miele C. Raciti G.A. Beguinot F. Consiglio E. Di Jeso B. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) reveal that ER stress induces dedifferentiation and an epithelial-mesenchymal transition in thyroid cells (PC C13). Notably, SFKs are activated following ER stress in these cells and their inhibition with PP2 prevents epithelial dedifferentiation. In addition, Src has been proposed to regulate ER stress-induced transcriptional activation of BiP (50Hong M. Lin M.Y. Huang J.M. Baumeister P. Hakre S. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16821-16828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In our studies, the phosphorylation of STAT3 and its activation correlated with SFK activation status. STAT3 is an established regulator of cell survival and inhibits apoptosis by up-regulating prosurvival proteins (51Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2486) Google Scholar). The increased activation of STAT3 in TCPTP KD cells could account for the decreased apoptosis. Together, changes in pancreatic PTP1B/TCPTP expression associated with prolonged ER stress and emulated by TCPTP KD and PTP1B overexpression in MIN6 cells may be a compensatory response to chronic ER stress to activate SFKs and attempt to delay cell death. Overall, our findings provide evidence that regulation of ER stress signaling and responses by PTP1B and TCPTP is mediated through a SFK signaling pathway. Conceivably, PTP1B and TCPTP can regulate ER stress through additional mechanism(s). One scenario involves direct interaction and dephosphorylation of component(s) in PERK/eIF2α subpathway. Mass spectroscopy studies reveal tyrosine phosphorylation of recombinant PERK (52Ma Y. Lu Y. Zeng H. Ron D. Mo W. Neubert T.A. Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 1693-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, PERK is capable of autophosphorylating on tyrosine residues (53Su Q. Wang S. Gao H.Q. Kazemi S. Harding H.P. Ron D. Koromilas A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 469-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In particular, Tyr615 plays an essential role in PERK kinase activation, and its phosphorylation coincides with phosphorylation at Thr980 (53Su Q. Wang S. Gao H.Q. Kazemi S. Harding H.P. Ron D. Koromilas A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 469-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Additional studies are required to address the potential regulation of PERK activation through tyrosine dephosphorylation by PTP1B and/or TCPTP. In addition, we do not exclude the possibility that these PTPs regulate IRE1α and/or ATF6 arms of the ER stress response. Indeed, the absence of PTP1B in fibroblasts leads to impaired ER stress-induced IRE1α signaling in fibroblasts (21Gu F. Nguyên D.T. Stuible M. Dubé N. Tremblay M.L. Chevet E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49689-49693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). TCPTP deletion in pancreatic β cells sensitizes them to IFN-γ-induced apoptosis (19Moore F. Colli M.L. Cnop M. Esteve M.I. Cardozo A.K. Cunha D.A. Bugliani M. Marchetti P. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), whereas PTP1B deficiency in fibroblasts (21Gu F. Nguyên D.T. Stuible M. Dubé N. Tremblay M.L. Chevet E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49689-49693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and liver (22Delibegovic M. Zimmer D. Kauffman C. Rak K. Hong E.G. Cho Y.R. Kim J.K. Kahn B.B. Neel B.G. Bence K.K. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) attenuates ER stress-induced apoptosis and protects against HFD-induced ER stress, respectively. By contrast, our studies demonstrate that TCPTP deficiency mitigates, whereas PTP1B deficiency enhances ER stress in β cells. The reasons for these differences are not apparent but could be due to different systems used (MIN6, fibroblasts, and liver) and/or inducers of ER stress and apoptosis (plamitate, tunicamycin versus Azc, IFN-γ, and HFD). Conceivably, PTP1B and TCPTP have distinct substrates and/or regulate distinct arms of ER stress signaling in different cells/tissues. Alternatively, they may affect the same pathways in different cells/tissues, but the effects of those pathways and/or the feedback regulatory pathways may differ in a tissue-specific manner. Of note, the duration and amplitude of PERK activation could determine the switch from PERK to IRE1α signaling. Extended PERK and IRE1α signaling have opposite effects on cell viability. Sustained PERK signaling impairs cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in 293 cells, whereas sustained IRE1α signaling enhances cell proliferation without promoting cell death (54Lin J.H. Li H. Zhang Y. Ron D. Walter P. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Our data provide new insights into the regulation of ER stress and reveal that PTP1B and TCPTP function in nonredundant manner to regulate pancreatic ER stress and apoptosis. Modulation of pancreatic PTP1B and TCPTP expression may be an adaptive mechanism that mitigates chronic ER stress. A better understanding of the dynamic regulation of these phosphatases will likely have implications for modulating pancreatic function and metabolic responses.

Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration play a critical role in the differentiation of neurons. However, whether EZH2 modulates intracellular Ca2+ signaling in regulating neuronal differentiation from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) still remains unclear. When hMSCs were treated with a Ca2+ chelator or a PLC inhibitor to block IP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling, neuronal differentiation was disrupted. EZH2 bound to the promoter region of PIP5K1C to suppress its transcription in proliferating hMSCs. Interestingly, knockdown of EZH2 enhanced the expression of PIP5K1C, which in turn increased the amount of PI(4,5)P2, a precursor of IP3, and resulted in increasing the intracellular Ca2+ level, suggesting that EZH2 negatively regulates intracellular Ca2+ through suppression of PIP5K1C. Knockdown of EZH2 also enhanced hMSCs differentiation into functional neuron both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, knockdown of PIP5K1C significantly reduced PI(4,5)P2 contents and intracellular Ca2+ release in EZH2-silenced cells and resulted in the disruption of neuronal differentiation from hMSCs. Here, we provide the first evidence to demonstrate that after induction to neuronal differentiation, decreased EZH2 activates the expression of PIP5K1C to evoke intracellular Ca2+ signaling, which leads hMSCs to differentiate into functional neuron lineage.

https://openalex.org/W2068834964,"The membrane-integrated transcriptional regulator CadC of Escherichia coli activates expression of the cadBA operon at low external pH with concomitantly available lysine, providing adaptation to mild acidic stress. CadC is a representative of the ToxR-like proteins that combine sensory, signal transduction, and DNA-binding activities within a single polypeptide. Although several ToxR-like regulators such as CadC, as well as the main regulator of Vibrio cholerae virulence, ToxR itself, which activate gene expression at acidic pH, have been intensively investigated, their molecular activation mechanism is still unclear. In this study, a structure-guided mutational analysis was performed to elucidate the mechanism by which CadC detects acidification of the external milieu. Thus, a cluster of negatively charged amino acids (Asp-198, Asp-200, Glu-461, Glu-468, and Asp-471) was found to be crucial for pH detection. These amino acids form a negatively charged patch on the surface of the periplasmic domain of CadC that stretches across its two subdomains. The results of different combinations of amino acid replacements within this patch indicated that the N-terminal subdomain integrates and transduces the signals coming from both subdomains to the transmembrane domain. Alterations in the phospholipid composition did not influence pH-dependent cadBA expression, and therefore, interplay of the acidic surface patch with the negatively charged headgroups is unlikely. Models are discussed according to which protonation of these acidic amino acid side chains reduces repulsive forces between the two subdomains and/or between two monomers within a CadC dimer and thereby enables receptor activation upon lowering of the environmental pH."
https://openalex.org/W2030516235,"The INO80 and SWR1 complexes belong to the INO80 subfamily of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. These complexes interact with nucleosomes and remodel chromatin by either sliding nucleosomes along the DNA or exchanging histones within nucleosomes. In doing so, the INO80 and SWR1 complexes promote recruitment of regulatory factors to DNA.

Distinct from other subfamilies of chromatin remodeling complexes, INO80 and SWR1 contain core ATPases with a unique split ATPase domain, as well as Rvb proteins, which share limited homology to bacterial RuvB, the Holliday Junction DNA Helicase. They bind to histone H2A variants (H2AX, H2A.Z) and have been implicated in the alteration of chromatin structure during transcription, replication, and DNA repair.

https://openalex.org/W2063399270,"Fe(II)- and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)-dependent dioxygenases are a large and diverse superfamily of mononuclear, non-heme enzymes that perform a variety of oxidative transformations typically coupling oxidative decarboxylation of α-KG with hydroxylation of a prime substrate. The biosynthetic gene clusters for several nucleoside antibiotics that contain a modified uridine component, including the lipopeptidyl nucleoside A-90289 from Streptomyces sp. SANK 60405, have recently been reported, revealing a shared open reading frame with sequence similarity to proteins annotated as α-KG:taurine dioxygenases (TauD), a well characterized member of this dioxygenase superfamily. We now provide in vitro data to support the functional assignment of LipL, the putative TauD enzyme from the A-90289 gene cluster, as a non-heme, Fe(II)-dependent α-KG:UMP dioxygenase that produces uridine-5'-aldehyde to initiate the biosynthesis of the modified uridine component of A-90289. The activity of LipL is shown to be dependent on Fe(II), α-KG, and O(2), stimulated by ascorbic acid, and inhibited by several divalent metals. In the absence of the prime substrate UMP, LipL is able to catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of α-KG, although at a significantly reduced rate. The steady-state kinetic parameters using optimized conditions were determined to be K(m)(α-KG) = 7.5 μM, K(m)(UMP) = 14 μM, and k(cat) ≈ 80 min(-1). The discovery of this new activity not only sets the stage to explore the mechanism of LipL and related dioxygenases further but also has critical implications for delineating the biosynthetic pathway of several related nucleoside antibiotics."

MHC Class II expression is controlled by the transactivator CIITA. CIITA expression in conventional DCs is uniquely dependent on an uncharacterized myeloid cell-specific promoter, CIITApI. We now identify in vivo the promoter structure and factors regulating CIITApI. In immature DCs transcription requires binding of PU.1, IRF8, NFκB, and Sp1 to the promoter.

Nussenzweig M.C. Immunol. Rev. 2010; 234: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). DCs reside in peripheral tissues such as the skin as well as in the spleen and lymph nodes where they survey the environment for pathogens. DCs can also migrate from peripheral tissues to the lymph node upon encounter with pathogens to facilitate antigen presentation to T cells. Recent studies have revealed that DCs comprise multiple subsets with both specialized and overlapping functions and tissue distribution (2Heath W.R. Carbone F.R. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) are unique in the ability to secrete large amounts of Type-I interferon and have lymphoid characteristics. Conventional DCs (cDC) encompass the other subtypes including monocyte-derived DCs and are the predominant type detected in the periphery. Encounter with pathogen or inflammatory stimuli induce cDCs to undergo maturation and increase antigen presentation. This is reflected in increased cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) and co-stimulatory molecules as well as secretion of TH1- or TH2-inducing cytokines (3Pierre P. Turley S.J. Gatti E. Hull M. Meltzer J. Mirza A. Inaba K. Steinman R.M. Mellman I. Nature. 1997; 388: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 4Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. Immunol.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 15050-15055Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Immature DCs have highly active antigen processing machinery; however, antigen presentation is limited by the low level of antigen-bound MHC-II located on the cell surface. The expressed MHC-II molecules accumulate in peptide loading compartments within the immature DCs, and those that migrate to the cell surface are ubiquitinated by the E3-ligase MARCH1, which promotes endocytosis and turnover (8Shin J.S. Ebersold M. Pypaert M. Delamarre L. Hartley A. Mellman I. Nature. 2006; 444: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 9van Niel G. Wubbolts R. Ten Broeke T. Buschow S.I. Ossendorp F.A.

Immature DCs upon receiving a maturation signal such as Toll-like receptor engagement with pathogen-associated molecules switch from antigen processing to antigen presentation facilitated in part by the down-regulation of MARCH1 (10De Gassart A. Camosseto V. Thibodeau J. Ceppi M. Catalan N. Pierre P. Gatti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3491-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This is paralleled by a cessation of new MHC-II synthesis to fix the presentation of antigen captured at the time of pathogen recognition. Thus, although MHC-II expression is increased on the cell surface upon maturation, the transcription of MHC-II is silenced.CIITA is a transcriptional co-activator that acts as a master regulator of MHC-II gene expression (11Drozina G. Kohoutek J. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 290: 147-170PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wright K.L. Ting J.P.

The CIITA gene is tightly controlled at the level of transcription and utilizes three distinct promoters each transcribing a unique first exon (20Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Transcription of CIITA from promoter I (CIITApI) is restricted to cells of the myeloid linage including cDCs and macrophages. CIITA promoter III (CIITApIII) is active primarily in cells of lymphoid lineage including B and T cells, although expression can also be detected in DCs. CIITApIV is responsive to IFNγ in non-hematopoietic cells. Mice with targeted deletion of either CIITApIV or both CIITApIV and CIITApIII confirm that CIITApI is functionally sufficient for CIITA expression in myeloid-derived DCs and macrophages, whereas CIITApIII is required for expression in B cells (6LeibundGut-Landmann S.

CIITApIII is regulated in B cells through five elements that recruit NF1, Oct1, CREB/ATF, AML2, IRF4, and PU.1 (22Ghosh N. Piskurich J.F. Wright G. Hassani K. Ting J.P. Wright K.L. J. Biol.

The IRF4 and PU.1 factors bind at site C, which represents an Ets-IRF composite element (EICE). Recently, PU.1 binding at a distal enhancer located 11 kb upstream of CIITApIII was also shown to be required for CIITApIII activity in B cells (25Yoon H. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 5018-5028Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CIITApIV transcription depends on IFNγ-induced STAT1 and IRF1 binding at its proximal promoter (26Morris A.C. Beresford G.W.

CIITA silencing during B cell to plasma cell differentiation has been directly linked to the transcriptional repressor PRDM1 (Blimp-1) (30Ghosh N. Gyory I. Wright G. Wood J. Wright K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15264-15268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Piskurich J.F. Lin K.I. Lin Y. Wang Y. Ting J.P. Calame K. Nat.

Immunol. 2008; 26: 133-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In both cases PRDM1 is part of a negative feedback loop with BCL6 (33Crotty S. Johnston R.J. Schoenberger S.P. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently shown that PRDM1 is expressed in natural killer cells, where it attenuates NK activation (34Smith M.A. Maurin M. Cho H.I. Becknell B. Freud A.G. Yu J. Wei S. Djeu J. Celis E. Caligiuri M.A. Wright K.L. J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 6058-6067Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PRDM1 can also be induced by proteasome inhibitor treatment in mantle cell lymphoma and contributes to the apoptotic response (35Desai S. Maurin M. Smith M.A. Bolick S.C. Dessureault S. Tao J. Sotomayor E. Wright K.L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2010; 8: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PRDM1 functions by binding to DNA and serves as a scaffold to recruit chromatin-modifying enzymes, specifically the histone deacetylase HDAC2, the histone H3 lysine 9 dimethyltransferase G9a, and the histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase LSD1 (36Gyory I.

The PRDM1 DNA binding site consensus has overlapping homology with the IRF consensus (39Kuo T.C. Calame K.L. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5556-5563Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). At the CIITApIV promoter, PRDM1 can compete with IRF1, whereas at CIITApIII, PRDM1 binds the EICE element at site C (30Ghosh N. Gyory I. Wright G. Wood J. Wright K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15264-15268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Tooze R.M. Stephenson S. Doody G.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4584-4593Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, PRDM1 can suppress transcription of its target promoters though displacement of a required IRF factor as well as inducing multiple chromatin structure changes. In addition to its role in suppressing CIITApIII during plasma cell differentiation, PRDM1 also suppresses IFNγ-mediated activation of CIITApIII and CIITApIV in B cells (40Tooze R.M. Stephenson S. Doody G.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4584-4593Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 41Chen H. Gilbert C.A. Hudson J.A. Bolick S.C. Wright K.L. Piskurich J.F. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).The factors activating or repressing CIITApI remain unknown. Ablation of IRF8 in mice inhibits CD8+ DC development and prevents expression from CIITApI, although whether this is a direct or indirect effect was not known (42Tsujimura H. Tamura T. Gongora C. Aliberti J. Reis e Sousa C. Sher A. Ozato K. Blood. 2003; 101: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Landmann et al. (5Landmann S. Mühlethaler-Mottet A. Bernasconi L. Suter T.

Med. 2001; 194: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) revealed loss of CIITA transcription during cDC maturation induced by multiple stimuli. The mechanism was not investigated, but a global loss of histone acetylation across all of the CIITA promoters was observed. LPS suppression of CIITA in cDC requires an intact MyD88-dependent pathway utilizing ERK and p38 MAPK signaling (43Yao Y. Xu Q. Kwon M.J. Matta R. Liu Y. Hong S.C. Chang C.H. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, conditional knock-out of PRDM1 in hematopoietic and endothelial cells was shown to disrupt DC development (44Chan Y.H. Chiang M.F. Tsai Y.C. Su S.T. Chen M.H. Hou M.S. Lin K.I. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 7039-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PRDM1 expression increased in murine bone marrow-derived cDC upon receiving maturation signals. This induction required p38 MAPK and NFκB and directly affected transcription of IL-6 and MCP-1 (Ccl2). This presents the possibility that PRDM1 may also affect CIITA regulation in cDCs.In this report we define the transcription factors required for CIITA transcription in cDC and show that PU.1 and IRF8 synergize to promote promoter assembly and activate transcription. We also now link the mechanism of CIITA silencing in cDC to direct PRDM1 recruitment at the promoter followed by chromatin remodeling and disassembly of the promoter.DISCUSSIONIn this report we have provided evidence for counter regulation of CIITA by IRF8/PU.1 and PRDM1 during the maturation of human monocyte-derived DCs. We have identified functional components of the transcriptionally competent CIITApI in immature DC and demonstrate its disassembly upon maturation. Furthermore, PRDM1 mediates a transition from an active to a repressed chromatin state, resulting in stable silencing of CIITA in mature DCs. This work complements the previous report by Chan et al. (44Chan Y.H. Chiang M.F. Tsai Y.C. Su S.T. Chen M.H. Hou M.S. Lin K.I. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 7039-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and identifies CIITApI as a novel site of PRDM1-mediated regulation. Importantly, PRDM1 is now shown to compete with IRF8 for EICE sites and to regulate all three functional CIITA promoters, suggesting a coordinate mechanism to control MHC-II expression in multiple immune cell lineages.Numerous transcription factors have been identified that modulate phenotypic changes associated with DC maturation. IRF4 and IRF8 are closely related transcription factors that physically interact with PU.1 to regulate gene expression via recognition of interferon-responsive sequence element and EICE sequence elements (49Marecki S. Fenton M.J. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 33: 127-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both factors function in monocyte differentiation into DC in vitro and regulate both a common set of genes as well as unique targets (51Tamura T. Tailor P. Yamaoka K. Kong H.J. Tsujimura H. O'Shea J.J. Singh H. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that both IRF8 and IRF4 are present in DCs and contribute to CIITA activation during DC differentiation. In our system IRF8 appears to be functionally dominant, as indicated by increased luciferase activity and higher levels of binding both in vivo and in vitro relative to IRF4. Furthermore, a functional EICE element is required for activation. Accordingly, IRF8 transduction into Irf8−/− mice rescues both DC maturation and expression of MHC-II in a DNA binding-dependent manner (42Tsujimura H. Tamura T. Gongora C. Aliberti J. Reis e Sousa C. Sher A. Ozato K. Blood. 2003; 101: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Our data indicate that the p65 NFκB subunit and the ubiquitous transcriptional activator Sp1 are components of the active complex at CIITApI in immature DCs. Contacts were detected at the putative binding sites for these factors in footprinting experiments that were lost upon maturation, and site-directed mutagenesis of the potential NFκB binding residues abrogated basal CIITApI activity in luciferase reporter assays. Sp1 has been shown to be required for CD11c expression and may be an important general activator during DC maturation (52Lopez-Rodriquez C. Hui-Min C. Daniel G.T. Angel L.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3496-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, p65 itself is likely not sufficient for CIITA expression in DCs as DC maturation proceeds normally, and no defects in MHC-II expression are observed when p65−/− hematopoietic progenitors are adoptively transferred into lethally irradiated hosts (53Ouaaz F. Arron J. Zheng Y. Choi Y. Beg A.A. Immunity. 2002; 16: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). However, DC development is severely impaired when both p65 and p50 are simultaneously knocked out, suggesting that cross-talk and compensatory mechanisms exists among the multiple NFκB subunits. Our EMSA experiments confirm this, as binding to a probe spanning the Sp1/NFκB region was markedly diminished in the presence of antibodies to p50, p65, Rel-B, and Sp-1.Our results also implicate PU.1 in the regulation of CIITApI. We identified two functionally important PU.1 sites within human CIITApI; that is, one upstream of the transcriptional start site and another immediately downstream of the start site and within the context of an EICE element. Both sites displayed maturation-dependent changes by in vivo footprinting, bound a PU.1 site-containing probe in EMSA experiments, and conferred basal activity to CIITApI in luciferase assays. As an interacting partner with IRF4/8, PU.1 is known to be required for the generation of DC. Indeed, ablation of PU.1 diminishes the ability of bone marrow precursors to develop into either conventional or plasmacytoid DCs (54Guerriero A. Langmuir P.B. Spain L.M. Scott E.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 879-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Carotta S. Dakic A. D'Amico A. Pang S.H. Greig K.T. Nutt S.L. Wu L. Immunity. 2010; 32: 628-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Several studies have implicated PU.1 in the regulation of CIITA. B cell-specific CIITA expression is conferred through PU.1 binding to pIII in conjunction with E47 and IRF4. In B cells, enforced expression of both PU.1 and IRF8 is not sufficient to drive CIITApIII expression, suggesting important lineage-specific differences between activation requirements of promoter I and promoter III (23van der Stoep N. Quinten E. Marcondes Rezende M. van den Elsen P.J. Blood. 2004; 104: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, PU.1 was shown to bind to a distal regulatory element 11 kb upstream of promoter III, which was required for B cell CIITA expression (25Yoon H. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 5018-5028Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PU.1 also regulates inducible CIITA expression through binding to promoter IV in mast cells in response to IFNγ (29Ito T. Nishiyama C. Nakano N. Nishiyama M. Usui Y. Takeda K. Kanada S. Fukuyama K. Akiba H. Tokura T. Hara M. Tsuboi R. Ogawa H. Okumura K. Int. Immunol. 2009; 21: 803-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the latter two reports, PU.1 binding was also detected at promoter I, albeit at lower levels. Importantly, in DCs PU.1 appears to function both alone and within the context of its interacting partner IRF8 by binding to both PU.1 and EICE sites present within CIITApI.In response to a Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived lipoprotein, C/EBPβ binds to PU.1 sites at pI and pIV to prevent MHC-II expression in macrophages (56Pennini M.E. Liu Y. Yang J. Croniger C.M. Boom W.H. Harding C.V. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 6910-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and lung DCs infected with Mycobacterium bovis exhibit decreased MHC-II expression relative to uninfected DCs (57Pecora N.D. Fulton S.A. Reba S.M. Drage M.G. Simmons D.P. Urankar-Nagy N.J. Boom W.H. Harding C.V. Cell. Immunol. 2009; 254: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that competition for PU.1 sites regulates CIITA expression. In our EMSA experiments we did not detect binding of C/EBPβ to the PU.1 site under non-pathological conditions. Collectively, these data implicate PU.1 as a critical regulator of CIITA in a variety of contexts and suggest that competition for PU.1 sites may have important implications for proper antigen presentation function during infection.Given that CIITA mRNA levels decrease upon maturation, we were interested in determining the factors involved in mediating this silencing. PRDM1 has been shown to associate with DC maturation and lead to transcriptional silencing of Il6 and Ccl2 (44Chan Y.H. Chiang M.F. Tsai Y.C. Su S.T. Chen M.H. Hou M.S. Lin K.I. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 7039-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). IL-6 is a negative regulator of DC maturation and Il6−/− mice have increased numbers of DCs (58Park S.J. Nakagawa T. Kitamura H. Atsumi T. Kamon H. Sawa S. Kamimura D. Ueda N. Iwakura Y. Ishihara K. Murakami M. Hirano T. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3844-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Here we provide further support for a role of PRDM1 in DC maturation, identifying CIITApI as a novel direct target of binding. PRDM1 has previously been shown to silence both pIII and pIV in B cells (30Ghosh N. Gyory I. Wright G. Wood J. Wright K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15264-15268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Piskurich J.F. Lin K.I. Lin Y. Wang Y. Ting J.P. Calame K. Nat.

Immunol. 2006; 43: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PRDM1 is well known to control terminal differentiation of mature B-cells into antibody-producing plasma cells, whereas more recent studies have demonstrated that PRDM1 controls effector functions in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (60Gong D. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 61Kallies A. Hawkins E.D. Belz G.T. Metcalf D. Hommel M. Corcoran L.M. Hodgkin P.D. Nutt S.L. Nat.

Immunity. 2009; 31: 309-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our group has demonstrated that PRDM1 is involved in the negative regulation of effector cytokine production in human NK cells (34Smith M.A. Maurin M. Cho H.I. Becknell B. Freud A.G. Yu J. Wei S. Djeu J. Celis E. Caligiuri M.A. Wright K.L. J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 6058-6067Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of final effector function appears to be a common modality across numerous immune lineages.PRDM1 mediates silencing of CIITA in DCs through two distinct mechanisms. First, PRDM1 can compete with IRF8 for binding to the promoter. Indeed, we observed reciprocal occupancy of IRF8 and PRDM1 at the CIITApI promoter with kinetics consistent with silencing. Furthermore, IRF8-mediated activation of luciferase under the control of CIITApI is completely abrogated in the presence of PRDM1. PRDM1 has been previously reported to compete with IRF1/2 for DNA binding in vitro, but little competition was observed with IRF8 (39Kuo T.C. Calame K.L. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5556-5563Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, a recent ChIP-on-chip analysis defined AANNGAAA as the dominant motif among PRDM1-bound target genes in the U266 myeloma cell line (66Doody G.M. Care M.A. Burgoyne N.J. Bradford J.R. Bota M. Bonifer C. Westhead D.R. Tooze R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5336-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This suggests that in vivo PRDM1 binding site sequences are less restricted and could encompass many IRF binding factors. Importantly, this motif is present in CIITApI and bound by PRDM1 in mature monocyte-derived DCs. Our in vivo footprinting and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that 48-h DC maturation results in a complete loss of the activating factors bound to DNA and large chromatin changes associated with silencing of CIITApI. However, at 24 h of maturation the promoter appears to have an intermediate structure where the factors are mostly bound but histone acetylation is decreasing (Ref. 5Landmann S. Mühlethaler-Mottet A. Bernasconi L. Suter T. Waldburger J.M. Masternak K. Arrighi J.F. Hauser C. Fontana A. Reith W. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and data not shown).

Our recent studies indicate that the vascular K<sub>ATP</sub> channel is inhibited in oxidative stress via <i>S</i>-glutathionylation. Here we show evidence for the molecular basis of the <i>S</i>-glutathionylation and its structural impact on channel gating. By comparing the oxidant responses of the Kir6.1/SUR2B channel with the Kir6.2/SUR2B channel, we found that the Kir6.1 subunit was responsible for oxidant sensitivity. Oxidant screening of Kir6.1-Kir6.2 chimeras demonstrated that the N terminus and transmembrane domains of Kir6.1 were crucial. Systematic mutational analysis revealed three cysteine residues in these domains: Cys<sup>43</sup>, Cys<sup>120</sup>, and Cys<sup>176</sup>. Among them, Cys<sup>176</sup> was prominent, contributing to >80% of the oxidant sensitivity. The Kir6.1-C176A/SUR2B mutant channel, however, remained sensitive to both channel opener and inhibitor, which indicated that Cys<sup>176</sup> is not a general gating site in Kir6.1, in contrast to its counterpart (Cys<sup>166</sup>) in Kir6.2. A protein pull-down assay with biotinylated glutathione ethyl ester showed that mutation of Cys<sup>176</sup> impaired oxidant-induced incorporation of glutathione (GSH) into the Kir6.1 subunit. In contrast to Cys<sup>176</sup>, Cys<sup>43</sup> had only a modest contribution to <i>S</i>-glutathionylation, and Cys<sup>120</sup> was modulated by extracellular oxidants but not intracellular GSSG. Simulation modeling of Kir6.1 <i>S</i>-glutathionylation suggested that after incorporation to residue 176, the GSH moiety occupied a space between the slide helix and two transmembrane helices. This prevented the inner transmembrane helix from undergoing conformational changes necessary for channel gating, retaining the channel in its closed state."
https://openalex.org/W2063603929,"Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 3 (CEACAM3) is an immunoglobulin-related receptor expressed on human granulocytes. CEACAM3 functions as a single chain phagocytotic receptor recognizing gram-negative bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which possess CEACAM-binding adhesins on their surface. The cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM3 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence that is phosphorylated upon receptor engagement. Here we show that the SH2 domains of the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) bind to tyrosine residue 230 of CEACAM3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. PI3K is rapidly recruited and directly associates with CEACAM3 upon bacterial binding as shown by FRET analysis. Although PI3K activity is not required for efficient uptake of the bacteria by CEACAM3-transfected cells or primary human granulocytes, it is critical for the stimulated production of reactive oxygen species by infected phagocytes and the intracellular degradation of CEACAM-binding bacteria. Together, our results highlight the ability of CEACAM3 to coordinate signaling events that not only mediate bacterial uptake, but also trigger the killing of internalized pathogens."

Here, we used immunoprecipitation and affinity pulldown of ectopically expressed p30 coupled with mass spectrometry to identify cellular binding partners of p30. Our data indicate that p30 specifically binds to cellular ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and REGγ (a nuclear 20 S proteasome activator). Under conditions of genotoxic stress, p30 expression was associated with reduced levels of ATM and increased cell survival. Knockdown or overexpression of REGγ paralleled p30 expression, suggesting an unexpected enhancement of p30 expression in the presence of REGγ. Finally, size exclusion chromatography revealed the presence of p30 in a high molecular mass complex along with ATM and REGγ.

From mechanical measurements with atomic force microscopy, we analyzed the molecular characteristics of selectins complexed with ligands and antibodies. Respective stiffness of L-, E-, and P-selectins (4.2, 1.4, and 0.85 piconewton/nm) correlated inversely with the number (2, 6, and 9) of consensus repeats in the selectin structures that acted as springs in series to dominate their compliance. After reconstitution into a lipid bilayer, purified membrane P-selectin remained a dimer, capable of forming dimeric bonds with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL)-1, endoglycan-Ig, and a dimeric form of a glycosulfopeptide modeled after the N terminus of PSGL-1. By comparison, purified membrane L- and E-selectin formed only monomeric bonds under identical conditions. Ligands and antibodies were much less stretchable than selectins. The length of endoglycan-Ig was found to be 51 ± 12 nm. These results provide a comprehensive characterization of the molecular stiffness of selectins and illustrate how mechanical measurements can be utilized for molecular analysis, e.g. evaluating the multimericity of selectins and determining the molecular length of endoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W1970411218,"The relationship between various amyloidoses and chaperones is gathering attention. In patients with dialysis-related amyloidosis, α(2)-macroglobulin (α2M), an extracellular chaperone, forms a complex with β(2)-microglobulin (β2-m), a major component of amyloid fibrils, but the molecular mechanisms and biological implications of the complex formation remain unclear. Here, we found that α2M substoichiometrically inhibited the β2-m fibril formation at a neutral pH in the presence of SDS, a model for anionic lipids. Binding analysis showed that the binding affinity between α2M and β2-m in the presence of SDS was higher than that in the absence of SDS. Importantly, SDS dissociated tetrameric α2M into dimers with increased surface hydrophobicity. Western blot analysis revealed that both tetrameric and dimeric α2M interacted with SDS-denatured β2-m. At a physiologically relevant acidic pH and in the presence of heparin, α2M was also dissociated into dimers, and both tetrameric and dimeric α2M interacted with β2-m, resulting in the inhibition of fibril growth reaction. These results suggest that under conditions where native β2-m is denatured, tetrameric α2M is also converted to dimeric form with exposed hydrophobic surfaces to favor the hydrophobic interaction with denatured β2-m, thus dimeric α2M as well as tetrameric α2M may play an important role in controlling β2-m amyloid fibril formation."
https://openalex.org/W1983084819,"The objective of the current study was to delineate the pathway of complement activation that is crucial for the induction of experimental autoimmune anterior uveitis (EAAU). We studied the development of EAAU in melanin-associated antigen (MAA)-sensitized Lewis rats treated with antibody against C4 or factor B. Control animals received isotype IgG control. Antibody against C4 had no effect on EAAU, and all of the animals developed EAAU similar to those injected with control IgG. In contrast, EAAU was completely inhibited in all MAA-sensitized Lewis rats injected with factor B antibody. Treatment with anti-factor B antibody resulted in suppression of ocular complement activation. Adoptive transfer of T lymphocytes harvested from draining lymph nodes of donor animals treated with anti-factor B did not transfer EAAU to naïve syngenic rats. Anti-factor B antibody inhibited the ability of MAA-specific CD4(+) T cells to proliferate (in vitro) in response to MAA in a dose-dependent manner. Level of TNF-α and IFN-γ decreased in the presence of anti-factor B. Collectively, our results provide the novel finding that complement activation via the alternative pathway contributes to intraocular inflammation in EAAU, and anti-factor B-mediated inhibition of EAAU is due to diminished antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell responses to MAA. Our findings explain the interactions between the complement system and T cells that are critical for the induction of EAAU and may lead to the development of therapy for idiopathic anterior uveitis based on selective blockade of the alternative pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2082412043,"Tumor cells very often have elevated expression of HSP70, the anti-apoptotic properties of which contribute to overall tumor survival. Independent of its anti-apoptotic properties, HSP70 was also suggested to be involved in the antigen presentation process by chaperoning cytosolic peptides, thus protecting them from rapid degradation and securing the peptide pool for further processing. In this study, we identified a 33-amino acid N-terminal dermcidin (DCD)-derived peptide from the repertoire of in vivo HSP70-associated peptides isolated from a leukemic cell line, K562. The DCD peptide has been previously shown to be involved in tumorigenesis, to increase tumor survival rate, to improve tumor stress resistance, and to aid growth. We show that HSP70 is a specific binding partner for the DCD prosurvival peptide and define an ATP-dependent DCD-binding site (GNPCH). We also identify an HLA-A*03 antigenic epitope within the DCD peptide, which follows and partially overlaps the HSP70-binding site (CHEASAAQK).

We previously reported a number of natively HSP70-associated peptides that were matched with the reported HLA class I and II epitopes (5Stocki P. Morris N.J. Preisinger C. Wang X.N. Kolch W. Multhoff G. Dickinson A.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2010; 15: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This suggests that HSP70 protects proteasome-generated peptides from further degradation and provides a range of suitably sized peptides for MHC presentation. However, the antitumor response mediated by HSP70 depends not only on the peptide cargo but also on HSP70 itself, i.e. HSP70 has been shown to stimulate natural killer cell responses to tumor cells (6Multhoff G.

The stimulation of natural killer cells by HSP70 was reported to lead to increased recognition of tumor-expressed MHC class I chain-related (MIC) molecules A and B and to trigger perforin-mediated apoptosis via NKG2D (8Elsner L. Muppala V. Gehrmann M. Lozano J. Malzahn D. Bickeböller H. Brunner E. Zientkowska M. Herrmann T. Walter L. Alves F. Multhoff G. Dressel R. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5523-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although immunologically competent cells exposed to tumor purified HSP70 can stimulate the antitumor reaction, the elevated levels of intracellular HSP70 observed in tumor cells improve their survival. The prosurvival mechanism of HSP70 was linked to its anti-apoptotic property (10Jäättelä M. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11Beere H.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2641-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). It was shown that HSP70 inhibits JNK and Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein), which regulate release of cytochrome c (12Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Rits S. Shifrin V.I. Sherman M.Y. J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 38729-38739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). When cytochrome c is released, HSP70 interferes with APAF-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor 1) and antagonizes the formation of a functional apoptosome (14Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). HSP70 has also been shown to inhibit TNFα-induced apoptosis subsequent to activation of caspases (15Jäättelä M. Wissing D. Kokholm K. Kallunki T. Egeblad M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6124-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was recently reported that HSP70 function in tumor cells is not predominantly linked to its anti-apoptotic activity but rather to its role in maintaining protein homeostasis, sustaining functional lysosomes and autophagy (16Leu J.I. Pimkina J. Frank A. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 15-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the mechanism by which HSP70 mediates tumor survival is not fully understood and remains to be elucidated. In this study, we analyzed in vivo HSP70-associated peptides and found a dermcidin (DCD) 2The abbreviations used are: DCD, dermcidin; DSEP, diffusible survival evasion peptide; IAA, iodoacetamide; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate); mo-iDCs, monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells; PIF, proteolysis-inducing factor. -derived peptide that was previously shown to have prosurvival functions in tumor cells and an unknown mechanism of action. It was shown that DCD was expressed constitutively only in sweat glands and in some parts of the brain (the pons and the paracentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex); however, up-regulation of DCD was also reported in a range of different human tumors (17Schittek B. Hipfel R. Sauer B. Bauer J. Kalbacher H. Stevanovic S. Schirle M. Schroeder K. Blin N. Meier F. Rassner G. Garbe C. Nat.

Prostate. 2007; 67: 1308-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that DCD promoted tumor growth and survival, which depended on the N-terminal fragment of DCD (18Porter D. Weremowicz S. Chin K. Seth P. Keshaviah A. Lahti-Domenici J. Bae Y.K. Monitto C.L. Merlos-Suarez A. Chan J. Hulette C.M. Richardson A. Morton C.C. Marks J. Duyao M. Hruban R. Gabrielson E. Gelman R. Polyak K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Prostate. 2007; 67: 1308-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This fragment corresponds to a diffusible survival evasion peptide (DSEP) that was previously isolated from culture medium conditioned with a neural cell line exposed to oxidative stress and associated with increased resistance to oxidative stress and immune evasion (20Cunningham T.J.

Fisher T.S. Neveu M. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 177: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the pathway this N-terminal DCD-derived peptide utilizes in its prosurvival functions remains elusive, the data presented in this work point at the specific interaction with HSP70 and may provide an insight into the prosurvival mechanism mediated by DCD. In this study, we show that HSP70 specifically interacts with a DCD-derived prosurvival peptide that contains the HLA-A*03 epitope and has the capacity to induce the T cell response. Therefore, this work explores the ubiquitous chaperoning function of HSP70 benefiting two unrelated cellular processes. The K562 leukemic cell line was grown and lysed as described previously by Stocki et al. (5Stocki P. Morris N.J. Preisinger C. Wang X.N. Kolch W. Multhoff G. Dickinson A.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2010; 15: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 g of K562 cell pellet was used for HSP70 purification. HSP70 purification was performed according to the method of Peng et al. (1Peng P. Ménoret A. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 204: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with the modifications as outlined by Stocki et al. (5Stocki P. Morris N.J. Preisinger C. Wang X.N. Kolch W. Multhoff G. Dickinson A.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2010; 15: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In brief, HSP70 was purified on an ADP-agarose column (A2810, Sigma) and subjected to buffer exchange on SephadexTM G-25 (GE Healthcare) to 30 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate. The samples were freeze-dried and resuspended in 0.1% (v/v) TFA before application to a Centricon 10 device (Millipore). The flow-through-containing peptide fraction was collected and freeze-dried before analysis by mass spectrometry. The peptide fraction was concentrated with a ZipTipC18 pipette tip (Millipore) and eluted with 0.1% TFA and 50% acetonitrile before drying in a SpeedVac system. The peptides were then resuspended in 0.1% formic acid (5 μl) and loaded onto a C18 trap column (Agilent Technologies). Peptides eluting from the column were analyzed by nano-LC/MS on a Finnigan LTQ-FT system (Thermo Electron Corp.). The raw fragmentation MS/MS data were analyzed by Mascot (22Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6776) Google Scholar) and further de novo validated using tools included in the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline platform (23Keller A. Eng J. Zhang N. Li X.J. Aebersold R. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2005; 1 (2005.0017)Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from either the fresh K562 or CCRF-CEM leukemic cell line using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). 1 μg of total RNA was denatured at 65 °C for 5 min. Reverse transcription was performed using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in 1× Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcription buffer (Invitrogen) in RNase-free water (Qiagen) supplemented with 1.5 mm dNTP mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 unit of RNasin/μl of reaction mixture (Promega), 10 μm random hexamers (GE Healthcare), and 10 mm DTT (Invitrogen). The reverse transcription reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by a deactivation step for 10 min at 65 °C. PCR was performed using 1 μl of cDNA, 0.1 unit/μl Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 1× GoTaq reaction buffer containing 1.5 mm MgCl2 (Promega), 0.2 mm dNTP (Fermentas), and a 0.5 μm concentration of each primer. The DCD-specific primers used were 5′-GCATACCCACTCCAGCAC-3′ and 5′-ACGGCTCCTTTACCCACG-3′, giving a product of 322 bp. The GAPDH-specific primers 5′-TGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAG-3′ and 5′-TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTGGGCCAT-3′ were used as a control to amplify a 240-bp product. The PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle at 94 °C for 3 min; three cycles at 92 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; three cycles at 92 °C for 30 s, 61 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; 35 cycles at 92 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and one cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel with a 100-bp marker (Promega) to determine the product size. Approximately 8 × 105 lysed K562 or CCRF-CEM cells were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. Samples were heated for 10 min at 95 °C with standard sample loading buffer at a final concentration of 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue. Where indicated, a cysteine-blocking protocol was used. The cell lysate was incubated with 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with 5 mm iodoacetamide (IAA) for 1 h at room temperature. Before running on a gel, the cysteine-blocked samples were heated for 10 min at 95 °C with modified sample loading buffer at a final concentration of 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue. Proteins were transferred from the gel using a wet transfer system (Bio-Rad) onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2-μm pore size; Bio-Rad). DCD was detected with goat-specific anti-human primary antibody (1:250 in TBS; clone A-20; sc-27467, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). GAPDH was detected with mouse-specific antibody (MAB374, Millipore), followed by HRP-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (1:10,000 in TBS; sc-2020, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000 in TBS; A5278, Sigma) and visualized with ECL Plus detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Customized peptide arrays were ordered from JPT Peptide Technologies. Peptides were synthesized at 5 nmol/spot with acetylated N termini and covalently bound by C termini with a polyethylene glycol linker to the cellulose membrane. Two isoforms of HSP70 were analyzed in the affinity assays: recombinant Hsp72 (NSP-555, Assay Designs) and recombinant Hsc70 (SPP-751, Assay Designs). The peptide arrays were blocked with 3% (w/v) skim milk powder in TBS for 3 h and then incubated with 100 nm Hsp72/Hsc70 in TBS overnight at 4 °C. The binding of the proteins to the peptides was detected after a 1-h incubation with mouse anti-Hsp72 (1:5000 in TBS; SPA-810, Assay Designs) or rabbit anti-Hsc70 (1:5000 in TBS; SPA-816, Assay Designs) primary antibody and a 1-h incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse (1:10,000 in TBS; SAB-100J, Assay Designs) or anti-rabbit (1:10,000 in TBS; A0545, Sigma) secondary antibody. The membranes were washed three times for 10 min with TBS after primary antibody incubation. After secondary antibody incubation, the membranes were washed three times for 5 min with 1% (w/v) SDS and 7% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol in TBS, and washing was continued if the background signal was not eliminated. A negative control was performed for each experiment by excluding Hsp72/Hsc70 from the incubation protocol. The detection was performed with ECL Plus detection reagents. The pictures were black-to-white-inverted, and the intensities of the spots were analyzed with ProScan software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The peptides were custom-synthesized (GenScript). All peptides had the same amino acid composition with a purity of >95% and a length of 33 residues. Peptides were biotinylated at the N termini with aminocaproic acid as a linker and were amidated at the C termini. 15 μl (∼9 × 105 cells) of K562 cell lysate (adjusted to 120 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)) or 26.4 pmol (∼1.85 μg) of recombinant Hsp72 was incubated with 396 pmol (∼1.4 μg) of each peptide in TBS for 10 min before running on a native polyacrylamide gel. Where indicated, the reaction was supplemented with 10 mm ATP, ADP, or ATPγS. Native gels (4% stacking and 15% resolving) were prepared without SDS. Native sample loading buffer at a final concentration of 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue was added before the samples were loaded onto a gel. Proteins were transferred from the gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2-μm pore size). For detection of biotinylated peptides, HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:20,000 in TBS; S5512, Sigma) was used. For detection of HSP70, a specific antibody (1:5000 in TBS; ab5439, Abcam), followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000 in TBS), was used. Visualization was performed with ECL Plus detection reagents. Healthy donors were serologically typed for HLA-A*03 (ab31572, Abcam). T cells from HLA-A*03-positive donors were isolated using a T cell enrichment mixture (STEMCELL Technologies). Three peptides were commercially synthesized at a purity of >95% (GenScript) and tested for their antigenic potential: KDI (KDILPRHIQ), DCDp (CHEASAAQK), and Pmel-17/gp100 (ALLAVGATK). Autologous monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (mo-iDCs) were generated (24Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4504) Google Scholar) in serum-free CellGro dendritic cell medium (CellGenix), pulsed with a 10 μm concentration of each peptide, and used to stimulate T cells at a 1:10 ratio. The cells were plated at a concentration of 0.7 × 106/ml in 6-well plates with the addition of 0.5 IU/ml IL-2. After 2 days of incubation, 20 IU/ml IL-2 and a 5 μm concentration of either peptide were added to the culture and further incubated for 8 days. The cells were then restimulated every 7 days with feeder cells, autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells pulsed with either peptide (10 μm) overnight, and then irradiated with 20 gray. The T cells were mixed with the feeder cells at a 1:1 ratio in the presence of 10 μm peptide and 20 IU/ml IL-2. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 100 IU/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% human AB serum (PAA Laboratories). After 6 weeks, the cells were tested using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) for the activated CD25-expressing CD8+ T cells. The antibodies used were obtained from BD Biosciences: antigen CD8 (clone SK1) and antigen CD25 (clone 2A3). For each test, 100,000 events were acquired. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). The T cells that were stimulated with the tested peptides were examined for their response when stimulated with the corresponding peptide-pulsed autologous mo-iDCs. The ratio used was 1:10 (0.5 × 105 T cells versus 0.5 × 104 mo-iDCs). The proliferation assay was performed on 96-well round-bottomed plates (200 μl/well; Greiner Bio-One). On day 4, 50 μl of the medium was collected for IFNγ analysis. The remaining culture was pulsed with [3H]thymidine (TRA310, GE Healthcare) at a concentration of 37 kBq/ml. The cells were further incubated for 16 h, and [3H]thymidine incorporation by proliferating cells was determined using a β-counter (Matrix 9600, Packard Instrument Co.). Each experiment was performed in triplicate. IFNγ secretion was analyzed using a cytometric bead array (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FCAP Array software (BD Biosciences). HSP70 was purified from the chronic myelogenous leukemic cell line K562. HSP70 was purified using ADP affinity chromatography, which allowed isolation of HSP70 with associated peptides (1Peng P. Ménoret A. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 204: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Stocki P. Morris N.J. Preisinger C. Wang X.N. Kolch W. Multhoff G. Dickinson A.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2010; 15: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The purification resulted in the isolation of a heterogeneous mixture of at least two cytosolic members of the HSP70 family: inducible Hsp72 and constitutive Hsc70 (data not shown) (5Stocki P. Morris N.J. Preisinger C. Wang X.N. Kolch W. Multhoff G. Dickinson A.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2010; 15: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Peptides isolated with HSP70 were analyzed by mass spectrometric techniques. The raw data analysis was performed with Mascot, which identified a 33-amino acid peptide derived from DCD. The fragmentation spectra of this 3210-Da peptide were further validated by de novo sequencing (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The peptide was derived from the N termini of DCD and localized between residues 20 and 52 of the full protein (gi:16751921) (Fig. 2). The sequence of the N-terminal DCD-derived peptide isolated with HSP70 overlaps with the reported prosurvival peptide DSEP, which is positioned between residues 20 and 49 of DCD (gi:16751921) (Fig. 2). In comparison with DSEP, the peptide isolated with HSP70 is 3 amino acids longer on the C-terminal end. The HSP70-isolated N-terminal DCD-derived peptide also shares residual homology with the proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF) peptide. PIF is, however, 13 amino acids shorter on the C-terminal end compared with the DCD-derived peptide isolated with HSP70. In addition, PIF has one residual substitution in position 15 (cysteine for serine) in comparison with DSEP or the DCD peptide isolated with HSP70 (Fig. 2) (21Cunningham T.J. Jing H. Akerblom I.

Therefore, to exclude the possibility of contamination or misinterpretation of the mass spectrometric data, the expression of DCD in the cell line was analyzed. Reverse transcription followed by PCR with specific primers was shown to produce a 322-bp band, as was expected for the DCD product (Fig. 3A). GAPDH-specific primers were used as a control and gave the PCR product of the desired size (Fig. 3A). Another leukemic cell line, CCRF-CEM, was tested using PCR and was shown not to express DCD (Fig. 3A). The expression of DCD at the protein level was also investigated. The expected size of DCD is ∼12 kDa with a signal secretory peptide or 9 kDa without (Fig. 2). Under standard SDS-PAGE conditions, followed by Western blotting, multiple bands were detected, but no bands at 12 or 9 kDa were seen (Fig. 3B).

Sporulation is regulated by at least five sensor histidine kinases that are activated in response to various environmental cues. One of these kinases, BA2291, harbors a sensor domain that has ∼35% sequence identity with two plasmid proteins, pXO1-118 and pXO2-61. Because overexpression of pXO2-61 (or pXO1-118) inhibits sporulation of B. anthracis in a BA2291-dependent manner, and pXO2-61 expression is strongly up-regulated by the major virulence gene regulator, AtxA, it was suggested that their function is to titrate out an environmental signal that would otherwise promote untimely sporulation. To explore this hypothesis, we determined crystal structures of both plasmid-encoded proteins. We found that they adopt a dimeric globin fold but, most unusually, do not bind heme. Instead, they house a hydrophobic tunnel and hydrophilic chamber that are occupied by fatty acid, which engages a conserved arginine and chloride ion via its carboxyl head group. In vivo, these domains may therefore recognize changes in fatty acid synthesis, chloride ion concentration, and/or pH. Structure-based comparisons with BA2291 suggest that it binds ligand and dimerizes in an analogous fashion, consistent with the titration hypothesis. Analysis of newly sequenced bacterial genomes points to the existence of a much broader family of non-heme, globin-based sensor domains, with related but distinct functionalities, that may have evolved from an ancestral heme-linked globin.

Fully virulent Bacillus anthracis carries two large plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, that are responsible for the production of its major virulence factors, anthrax toxin and the poly-γ-d-glutamic acid capsule (1Okinaka R.T. Cloud K. Hampton O. Hoffmaster A.R. Hill K.K. Keim P. Koehler T.M. Lamke G. Kumano S. Mahillon J. Manter D. Martinez Y. Ricke D. Svensson R. Jackson P.J. J.

Following host-triggered germination of B. anthracis spores, toxin and capsule enable the bacilli in their vegetative form to evade the host's immune system and replicate rapidly in the lymphatic system and bloodstream. If the infection is not treated at an early stage, toxemia and septicemia leading to host death may rapidly follow (4Mock M. Fouet A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 5Kang T.J. Fenton M.J. Weiner M.A. Hibbs S. Basu S. Baillie L. Cross A.S. Infect.

Sporulation is required for long term survival of B. anthracis following host death, but the process must be carefully coordinated with toxin expression and the progress of the infection because sporulating cells (in contrast to encapsulated vegetative cells) are susceptible to host defenses. Given that sporulation is directed primarily by chromosomal genes, close coordination with the regulatory elements encoded by plasmid genes is therefore required for effective pathogenesis. There is much evidence for such chromosome-plasmid “cross-talk,” although the overall picture is far from clear (for review, see Ref. 8Perego M. Hoch J.A. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For example, the pXO1-encoded protein, AtxA, regulates synthesis of toxin (also pXO1-encoded) as well as capsule (pXO2-encoded) (9Dai Z. Sirard J.C. Mock M. Koehler T.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10Uchida I. Hornung J.M. Thorne C.B. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. J.

Immun. 2003; 71: 2736-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). AtxA is also part of a regulatory network for S-layer synthesis (a further defensive layer distinct from the capsule and peptidoglycan cell wall), a task performed by chromosomal proteins (13Mignot T. Mock M. Fouet A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In turn, the synthesis of AtxA is regulated by the chromosomally encoded transcription factor Spo0A, the master regulator of sporulation (14Hadjifrangiskou M. Chen Y. Koehler T.M. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1874-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Saile E. Koehler T.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which completes a regulatory link between sporulation and virulence factor expression. Spo0A is activated by phosphorylation to induce or repress transcription of genes required or not required for sporulation, respectively (16Stephenson K. Hoch J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The regulatory pathway controlling Spo0A is more complex than most two-component signal transduction systems. In B. anthracis, this pathway includes at least five (chromosomally encoded) sensor histidine kinases that are capable of inducing sporulation (17Brunsing R.L. La Clair C. Tang S. Chiang C. Hancock L.E. Perego M. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6972-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as well as several aspartyl phosphatases, one of them encoded by the pXO1 virulence plasmid, that inhibit sporulation (18Bongiorni C. Stoessel R. Shoemaker D. Perego M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Bongiorni C. Stoessel R. Perego M. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2637-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Sensor histidine kinases are the primary sensors of environmental cues and form a large family of signaling proteins in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They have a modular architecture comprising at least a “sensor” domain and a catalytic domain (which includes the phosphorylatable domain, DHp, and the ATP-binding domain) that autophosphorylates on a histidine residue in response to sensor domain activation. Phosphohistidine is a high energy species that transfers its phosphoryl group to an aspartic acid residue on the downstream effector (for review, see Ref. 20Szurmant H. Hoch J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). BA2291 is one of the most active kinases in promoting sporulation in B. anthracis (17Brunsing R.L. La Clair C. Tang S. Chiang C. Hancock L.E. Perego M. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6972-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It also appears to be unique in using GTP rather than ATP as its energy source for phosphorylation (21Scaramozzino F. White A. Perego M. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and orthologs are found in most members of the Bacillus cereus group (a subfamily of the genus Bacillae, which includes B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis (an insect pathogen), but not Bacillus subtilis). Two plasmid-encoded proteins, pXO1-118 and pXO2-61, express “sensor-only” domains that share ∼35% sequence identity with BA2291 (22White A.K. Hoch J.A. Grynberg M. Godzik A. Perego M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6354-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and are only found in B. anthracis and certain strains of B. cereus that harbor similar plasmids. The pXO1-118 gene lies next to and is divergently transcribed from the atxA gene, whereas pXO2-61 lies within the region directing capsule synthesis. A microarray study found that transcription of pXO2-61 was strongly up-regulated when the atxA gene was present (12Bourgogne A. Drysdale M. Hilsenbeck S.G. Peterson S.N. Koehler T.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2736-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); and overexpression of pXO2-61 was found to reduce sporulation of B. anthracis in a BA2291-dependent manner (22White A.K. Hoch J.A. Grynberg M. Godzik A. Perego M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6354-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Expression of BA2291 in a B. subtilis model induced sporulation when expressed at lower copy levels, and this was repressed by co-expression of either pXO1-118 or pXO2-61. However, higher levels of BA2291 expression led to repression of sporulation, suggesting that when the activating signal is in limited supply, the kinase activity is reversed, and BA2291 acts as a phosphatase. These observations led to a model in which the plasmid-encoded sensor domains modulate BA2291 activity by titrating the sporulation signal, thereby preventing premature sporulation (22White A.K. Hoch J.A. Grynberg M. Godzik A. Perego M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6354-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To explore the molecular mechanisms of BA2291 regulation and the nature of the sporulation signal, we determined the crystal structures of pXO1-118 and pXO2-61 at high resolution. We show that they adopt a dimeric globin fold but, most unusually, do not bind heme. We demonstrate that they bind fatty acid and a halide ion (most likely chloride) in a central cavity, and we show that the key structural features of ligand recognition and dimerization are conserved in a large family of kinases found in bacilli and related species. This suggests that they recognize the same environmental cue(s) and support the titration mechanism for the sensor-only domains. Recognizable homologs are also found in a number of distinct bacterial phyla, and our analysis points to an evolution of the globin family into a versatile group of “heme-free” environmental sensors. The plasmid for Escherichia coli overexpression of B. anthracis ORF118 was obtained by cloning the PCR-amplified coding sequence using oligonucleotides BaORF1185′Nde (5′-GAGTGGACATATGGAAGCAACAAAACG-3′) and BaORF1183′Bam (5′-CTATAGGATCCAAAAATTTCAAGGTG-3′) into plasmid pET28a (Stratagene) digested with NdeI and BamHI. The coding sequence for residues 1–146 of BA2291 was amplified using oligonucleotides BaKin5′Nde (5′-TATTCGTCATATGGAAATGGAGGGAATG-3′) and BaKinXho2 (5′-TTTCCCTCGAGTTTTATAATATAATTTCCGAGTAT-3′), and the fragment cloned into pET28a digested with NdeI and XhoI. For pXO2-61, a synthetic gene was purchased from GenScript Co. and subcloned into pET28 as described for pXO1-118. Expression was obtained in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells grown in LB medium after induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 32 °C. All proteins included a His6 tag and were purified by nickel affinity chromatography on a His-trap chelating column (Pharmacia), followed by His tag removal by thrombin and size exclusion on Superdex 75 or Superdex 200 columns (Amersham Biosciences), the apparent molecular mass in each case was consistent with a dimer. pXO1-118 was stored at −20 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 50 μm KCl, 5 mm DTT. pXO2-61 and BA2291 sensor domains required 500 mm NaCl to keep the proteins stable for long term storage. For pXO1-118, selenomethionine-labeled protein was purified using a similar protocol, except that cells were grown in minimal medium supplemented with selenomethionine (23Harrison C.J. Bohm A.A. Nelson H.C. Science. 1994; 263: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of all proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Native and selenomethionine-labeled pXO1-118 were crystallized by sitting or hanging drop vapor diffusion at room temperature by mixing 3 μl of precipitant solution (40% (v/v) PEG 300, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 5.4, 5% (w/v) PEG 1000), and 3 μl of protein solution at 14 mg/ml. Rod-shaped crystals grew within 3 days in space group P3221 with cell dimensions a = 89.9 Å, c = 35.3 Å. One native and one selenomethionine data set at the selenium absorption edge were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Research Lightsource beamline 9-2, and the Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X26C, respectively, at 100 K. Diffraction images were processed and scaled with the HKL package (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). SOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Density modification increased the figure of merit to 0.60; and automatic model building in RESOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) generated a model that was 77% complete. Manual model building was carried out in O (27Kleywegt G.J. Zou J.Y.

The final model for pXO1-118 contains a single domain (residues 1–150), plus 3 nonnative N-terminal residues, 1 molecule of undecanoic acid, 95 water molecules, and 1 Cl− ion; and has Rwork = 0.181 and Rfree = 0.225 for data from 80 to 1.76 Å resolution. A dimer is generated by rotation of the monomer about a crystallographic dyad. pXO2-61 was crystallized by the microbatch method under paraffin oil. Crystals were obtained in 2 days from a buffer containing 1 m NaI, 20% (v/v) PEG 3350, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Crystals belong to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 44.1, b = 62.6 and c = 124.7 Å. Data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Research Lightsource to 1.49 Å resolution and processed with the HKL package. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the refined pXO1-118 structure as the search model. Model building and refinement were carried out in O and REFMAC5. The final model has Rwork = 0.177 and Rfree = 0.209 for data from 60 to 1.49 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit contains 2 molecules forming a dimer (residues 5–136 for each molecule), 364 water molecules, 26 I− ions, and 8 Na+ ions. The solvent content is 56.7%. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The stereochemical quality of both models was assessed using PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J.

The resulting two-phase system was sonicated for 10 min, incubated at 70 °C for 1 h, and then centrifuged. The organic phase was separated by syringe. For pXO2-61, the carboxylic acid group of the fatty acid was verified by using 20 μl of bis-trimethylsyliltrifluoroacetamide and 20 μl of pyridine incubated for 1.5 h at 65 °C.

All titrations were performed at 23 °C, and each experiment involved 37 injections.

Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a ProteomeLab XL-I (BeckmanCoulter) AUC. Protein samples (pXO2-61 or BA2291 sensor domain) in 20 mm Pipes, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, were loaded at concentrations of 0.5, 0.167, and 0.056 mg/ml in 6-channel equilibrium cells and spun in an An-50 Ti 8-place rotor at 25,000 rpm for 24 h at 20 °C. Data were analyzed with HeteroAnalysis software (J. L. Cole and J. W. Lary, University of Connecticut). In each case, an ideal equilibrium model gave a convincing fit for a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution, with dimer molecular mass values of 32.5 kDa (pXO2-61) and 33.8 kDa (BA2291 sensor domain) and no evidence for higher oligomers. The yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech) was used to explore interactions between pXO1-118 and AtxA. Coding genes were singly cloned into the bait plasmid (pGBT9) and prey plasmid (pGAD424). Assays were performed in the yeast strain AH109. We detected interaction when pXO1-118 was present on both pGBT9 and pGAD424, consistent with homodimer formation in yeast cells. There was no evidence for AtxA-pXO1-118 interactions (data not shown). Homologs of sensor domains were found using CS-BLAST (31Biegert A. Söding J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3770-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We solved the crystal structures of pXO1-118 and pXO2-61 at 1.76 Å and 1.49 Å resolution, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures,” Table 1, and FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). The asymmetric unit of pXO1-118 contains a single sensor domain that adopts the globin fold. Although it does not bind heme, we follow the standard nomenclature for hemoglobins: helices A, B, E, F, G, and H are present in pXO1-118, whereas helices C and D are replaced by an ordered loop (BE). A dimer is formed across a crystallographic dyad, mediated by the packing of the G and H helices from apposing monomers, forming an antiparallel, left-handed four-helix bundle (Fig. 1) that buries a large interface (∼3,500 Å2).FIGURE 1Structure of the B. anthracis pXO1-118 sensor domain.

The asymmetric unit in this case contains a dimer, and the monomers superpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.43 Å for Cα carbons. The most obvious external difference arises from a shorter C-terminal helix, leading to a more compact shape and a decrease in the dimerization interface, to 2,200 Å2. The dimers of pXO1-118 and pXO2-61 superpose with a root mean square difference of 1.2 Å for 264 Cα carbons (0.85 Å for pairwise comparisons of single domains). By AUC, we found that pXO2-61 forms dimers in solution at concentrations greater than or equal to micromolar (dimer Kd = 0.6 μm). We also purified the sensor domain from BA2291 and found that it also forms dimers in solution, with a similar Kd = 0.8 μm (supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, we demonstrated that pXO1-118 forms dimers in cells, as evidenced in a yeast two-hybrid system (see “Experimental Procedures”). The dimer interfaces of pXO1-118 and pXO2-61 include upper and lower hydrophobic regions that are more closely packed; whereas in the central section the helices diverge, and the interface is chiefly hydrophilic, comprising a large number of direct and water-mediated hydrophilic interactions (Fig. 1C). We found a total of 34 (pXO1-118) and 20 (pXO2-61) solvent molecules buried at distinct locations in this space. pXO1-118 has an additional interface formed by the ends of the longer C-terminal helices, which form a short antiparallel cross-over β-sheet with clusters of Tyr and Lys residues. Given the high homology between the BA2291 sensor domain and the plasmid domains (35% identity, 59% similarity) and the existence of a dimer in all cases, it is reasonable to assume that BA2291 will share a very similar tertiary and quaternary organization. Three-dimensional comparisons of the plasmid-encoded sensor domains using the DALI server (32Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) identified many structures with the globin fold that superpose with root mean square differences in the 2.3–2.7 Å range for ∼150 Cαs (supplemental Table I). However, the Protein Data Bank contains no close sequence homologs (identities range from 8 to 14%). Moreover, most proteins with the globin fold have an Fe-heme co-factor sandwiched between the E and F helices. The most similar structures (in both tertiary and quaternary organization) are two bacterial (B. subtilis and Geobacter) heme-containing oxygen sensor domains, which form dimers via a similar pairing of the G and H helices. There is one globin structure that lacks co-factor altogether: the B. subtilis stress response regulator RsbR (33Murray J.W. Delumeau O. Lewis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17320-17325Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); in this case, the dimerization helices (G and H) bend inward, eliminating the co-factor cavity. Mammalian hemoglobins have closely related tertiary folds, but only one, the recently discovered cytoglobin, has a related dimeric organization (34de Sanctis D. Dewilde S. Pesce A. Moens L. Ascenzi P. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The cyanobacter phycocyanins also adopt a globin-like fold (35Contreras-Martel C. Matamala A. Bruna C. Poo-Caamaño G. Almonacid D. Figueroa M. Martínez-Oyanedel J. Bunster M. Biophys. Chem. 2007; 125: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); they are electron transfer proteins involved in photosynthesis and bind porphyrin-like moieties via cysteine-mediated thioether bonds. However, they have large N-terminal extensions, and their quaternary organization is quite distinct from any of the hemoglobins. An overlay of pXO1-118 and the B. subtilis oxygen-sensor domain (36Zhang W. Phillips Jr., G.N. Structure. 2003; 11: 1097-1110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) illustrates the overall similarity in secondary and tertiary folds (Fig. 3A) and shows how helix E of pXO1-118 rotates and bends to pack more closely against helix F, partially filling the space that is occupied by heme in the oxygen sensor. The short rigid BE loop (which replaces the CD helix/turn) packs against the FG turn, stabilizing this conformation (see below). Oxygen-binding hemoglobins are linked to the heme via a “proximal histidine” at the eighth position of helix F (F8). In pXO1-118 (and pXO2-61), there is no similarly located histidine, and, as expected, attempts to reconstitute the proteins with hemin were unsuccessful (data not shown). Remarkably, DALI-based structural alignment places pXO1-118 residue Arg-74 at the F8 heme location (Fig. 3B). A cross-section through the central cavity (Fig. 3C) further demonstrates the steric mismatch between heme and the pXO1-118 cavity. As discussed below, Arg-74 is an invariant residue that appears to play a key role in binding an alternative co-factor (fatty acid; see Fig. 3B) and thus may be considered a structural and functional analog of the proximal histidine. Note that in RsbR, DALI-based structural alignment indicates that helix F is truncated such that there is no analog of F8 (Fig. 3D), consistent with its being co-factor-free. The central cavity runs roughly parallel with helices E and G, with a contour length of ∼20 Å (Fig. 4). It comprises a narrow (∼6-Å diameter) tunnel lined with hydrophobic and aromatic residues, capped at one end by residue Phe-19, which appears to act as a gate, adopting conformations that either open or close the hydrophobic entrance to the tunnel. The other end of the tunnel opens into a hydrophilic chamber, which is sealed from bulk solvent by a “canopy” created by the packing of the BE and FG turns. It includes water molecules as well as a heavier anion, which we believe to be chloride (see below). In pXO1-118, the cavity is also occupied by continuous worm-like electron density that ends in a symmetric bifurcation, consistent with the presence of a fatty acid (Fig. 4A). Using mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we determined that the major chloroform-soluble nonprotein component in the crystals is palmitic (hexadecanoic) acid, presumably derived from the cell wall of E. coli (37Song Y. Gunner M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 840-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) during expression or cell lysis (supplemental Fig. 2). The tunnel is long enough to completely bury tetradecanoic acid (with the Phe-19 gate in the open position), and additional methylene groups would presumably extrude into solvent. We searched for an authentic Bacillus co"

Previous work with HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes showed that carboxyl ester lipase (CEL), a broad-spectrum lipase secreted by pancreas and liver, plays an important role in hydrolysis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesteryl esters (CEs) after selective uptake by hepatocytes. The effect of CEL on RCT of HDL cholesterol was assessed by measuring biliary and fecal disposal of radiolabeled HDL-CE in control and Cel–/– mice. Radiolabeled CE was increased 3-fold in hepatic bile of Cel–/– mice, and the mass of CE in gall bladder bile was elevated. Total radiolabeled transport from plasma to hepatic bile was more rapid in Cel–/– mice. Fecal disposal of radiolabel from HDL-CE, as well as total sterol mass, was markedly elevated for Cel–/– mice, primarily due to more CE. RCT of macrophage CE was also increased in Cel–/– mice, as measured by excretion of radiolabel from injected J774 cells. Increased sterol loss was compensated by increased cholesterol synthesis in Cel–/– mice. Together, the data demonstrate significantly increased RCT in the absence of CEL and suggest a novel mechanism by which to manipulate plasma cholesterol flux.—Camarota, L. M., Woollett, L. A., Howles, P. N. Reverse cholesterol transport is elevated in carboxyl ester lipase-knockout mice. FASEB J. 25, 1370–1377 (2011). www.fasebj.org"
