https://openalex.org/W1998200935,"A protein fraction that induces blastulation of rabbit morula and stimulates blastocyst development has been isolated from the uterus of the rabbit at early pregnancy. Partial purification of this fraction indicates that the activity is restricted to a single homogeneous protein component. The term ""blastokinin"" is proposed to describe the compound."

https://openalex.org/W1968006751,Injection of 6 micrograms of aqueous norepinephrine elicits eating only when it takes place at sites within a limited region of the rat brain. The distribution of effective sites coincides with that of systems connected to an extrahypothalamic pathway between the limbic forebrain and tegmental motor systems. It does not correspond to those parts of the lateral hypothalamus thought to control normal feeding.

This is the first demonstration of an abnormality in heterozygotes for this rare inherited disease of childhood. Three-quarters of the cystine was recovered in the granular fraction of cystinotic leukocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1977409466,"Fetal mouse erythropoiesis proceeds initially in yolk-sac blood islands (8 to 12 days) and, subsequently, in liver (12 to at least 16 days). Yolksac cells synthesize three hemoglobins, Hb E(I), Hb E(II) and Hb E(III). Hb E(I) has x- and y-globin chains; Hb E(II) has alpha and y; HB E(III), alpha and z. No detectable beta-globin is formed in these cells. Liver erythroid cells form only adult hemoglobin, composed of alpha- and beta-chains."
https://openalex.org/W1964374964,"The injection of one antigen into mice inhibited the response to a second when 1 to 10 days separated the two injections. When the same type of inhibition was attempted in γ-irradiated mice reconstituted with normal spleen cells, the inhibition was greater in mice receiving 50 million spleen cells than in those receiving 10 million. The results are interpreted as favoring a humoral mechanism of inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2002262533,"Chikungunya virus and dengue type 2 virus were isolated from a single blood specimen taken from a patient in the acute phase of a dengue-like illness seen at Christian Medical College Hospital, Vellore, South India, in October 1964. In serial blood specimens collected from this patient there was an increase in antibody to these same two viruses. The technique for unmasking an agent (such as dengue) with a long incubation period in mice in the presence of an agent with a short incubation period is described."
https://openalex.org/W2051598952,"Theories of visual backward masking all assume that a masked target is eliminated from the visual system. Experiments on reaction time to masked signals suggest otherwise, as does a recent demonstration that a masked target can be restored to phenomenal awareness by backward masking of the target's mask. Two experiments are reported here that substantiate the possibility of recovering a masked target, by using different stimulus materials and a more elaborate design than was employed in the first demonstration of this effect."

https://openalex.org/W2007729331,Injection of lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate into mice in early pregnancy caused a 57 percent incidence of grossly abnormal embryos.
https://openalex.org/W2049248454,Glutamine synthetase in the developing retina of the chick embryo can be induced to increase by certain corticosteroids. The inductive effectiveness of various natural corticosteroids has been examined in organ cultures of embryonic retina and correlated with specific groupings on the steroid molecules.
https://openalex.org/W1975585335,Leukocyte cultures from eight human subjects who had had recent exposure to large doses of lysergic acid diethylamide were examined for chromosome abnormalities. The number of abnormalities was not significantly greater than that in control cultures.
https://openalex.org/W2093145984,"A single injection of any one of several long-acting adrenal corticosteroids at birth induces progressive cystic changes in nephrons which develop in the subcapsular zone of the rabbit kidney until 10 days after birth. These cystic lesions enlarge progressively and become visible within a few days after birth. When the animal is 2 weeks old, renal size has become three times as large as that of uninjected littermates. Adrenal corticosteroids prolong the duration of nephrogenic activity in the renal cortex. The cysts are blind and represent dilatation of the developing end of the collecting ducts. When the steroid-induced hypokalemia is prevented with repeated potassium chloride injections, renal cystic disease is almost completely prevented. Certain long-acting steroids induce cystic renal changes without systemic signs of toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2040582030,"Studies in vitro indicate that hydroxyethyl starch is an effective extracellular cryoprotective agent for erythrocytes. It is as effective as polyvinylpyrrolidone in cryophylactic ability. It is degraded to glucose units in the circulation, is not retained in tissues, and is inexpensive to produce. Changes in the size and degree of hydroxyethylation of the branched-chain starch may result in a more effective cryoprotective agent."
https://openalex.org/W2082827478,"A species of the genus Bacillus, capable of growth on normal alkanes at 70 degrees C, was isolated by the method known as enrichment culture. Preliminary analyses of its amino acid composition indicate that it would be a good source of protein for human nutrition. Possible advantages of the use of such organisms for the production of single-cell protein include simplification of fermentor cooling and asepsis."

https://openalex.org/W2059849612,Mating behavior in ovariectomized female rats treated with estrogen can be greatly enhanced by subcutaneous injections of progesterone. Application of potassium chloride to the cortex of females previously treated with estrogen can also induce greatly increased sexual receptivity as indicated by the lordosis response. This facilitation of mating behavior by a treatment known to cause functional decortication suggests that mechanisms mediating female mating behavior are under tonic inhibition by an inhibitory system which involves the cerebral cortex.

https://openalex.org/W2024212167,"Comparison of three porpoises (Tursiops truncatus and Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) given nitrous oxide with 18 given halothane, with complete documentation of reflexes and comprehensive physiological monitoring, showed halothane to be a suitable anesthetic for major surgery while nitrous oxide was found to be inadequate. In addition, sodium thiopental administered intravenously was successfully used to facilitate intubation procedures. This development eliminated the need to intubate awake porpoises."

https://openalex.org/W2026630231,"The hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine in collagen are synthesized by an apparently unique pathway in which proline and lysine are hydroxylated after they are incorporated into a large polypeptide precursor of collagen called protocollagen. When the hydroxylation of protocollagen in isolated tissues is intermittently interrupted, hydroxylation can occur after complete polypeptides are released from ribosomal complexes. Cartilage from chick embryos was incubated with the iron chelator alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl for 2 hours to inhibit protocollagen hydroxylase, and then the inhibition was reversed by transferring the tissues to medium containing ferrous iron and no alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl. ""Pulse labeling"" of the tissues during these two periods indicated that both the accumulated protocollagen and the polypeptides synthesized after reversal of the inhibition were hydroxylated at the same rate. Even when no measures are taken to inhibit the hydroxylation of protocollagen, most of the hydroxyproline in collagen is probably synthesized after complete protocollagen polypeptides are released from ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1982796854,"Behavior of membranes derived from collagen was investigated in rabbit corneas. Disks of the membrane were placed between the lamellae of corneas which were then examined grossly, biomicroscopically, and histologically. The membranes remained clear, and almost no reaction or evidence of reabsorption was seen during an observation period of 6 months. These characteristics make the material potentially useful for heterotransplantation in the cornea."

Differentiation of two cell types, melanophores and striated muscle, has been obtained. Myoblast proliferation and fusion can be selectively controlled by altering the culture medium."

https://openalex.org/W2045265274,A cell-free protein-synthesizing system made from rabbit reticulocytes was used to incorporate (14)C-amino acids into hemoglobin. Electrophoretic analyses of the soluble products of this cell-free system revealed a fraction containing rabbit (14)C-alpha chains in addition to the rabbit (14)C-hemoglobin. The addition of isolated human hemoglobin beta chains to this system during active synthesis inhibited the release of newly synthesized rabbit (14)C-beta chains into solution from the ribosome fraction. This inhibition was possibly a result of hybrid hemoglobin formation between rabbit alpha and human beta chains. A model of hemoglobin construction in which soluble alpha chains are intermediates is suggested. These alpha chains may aid in the release of beta chains from the polyribosomes during the completion of the hemoglobin molecule.

https://openalex.org/W1969321820,"Amantadine hydrochloride (Symmetrel), which is an antiviral agent marketed for the prevention of infection by influenza virus, inhibits the mitogenic response of human lymphocytes stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. The concentrations which effectively inhibited the response to phytohemagglutinin were similar to those which maximally inhibit virus replication. The drug inhibited the mitogenic response without affecting the ability of phytohemagglutinin to agglutinate leukocytes. The data suggest that phytohemagglutinin, amantadine, and certain lipid-containing RNA viruses take part in cell-membrane interactions of common nature."

https://openalex.org/W2027291981,"Fluctuations in naturally occurring levels of barometric pressure appear to be an important determinant of activity in laboratory mice. In three experiments, activity was higher after increases in barometric pressure than it was after decreases. When the barometric pressure remained relatively stable, intermediate levels of activity were observed."
https://openalex.org/W2064861679,"Natrix taxispilota hemoglobin has a very high oxygen affinity which depends upon pH in an unusual manner. The oxygen affinity increases slightly upon protein dilution, but the pK's of the Bohr groups are unchanged. Oxidation promotes hemoglobin polymerization, which can be inhibited by prior treatment with iodoacetamide. Reaction with iodoacetamide also causes a slight increase in the oxygen affinity, no change in the pK's of the Bohr groups, and a drastic reduction in heme-heme interaction."

https://openalex.org/W2017358481,"After learning an A-B paired-associates list, college students read a list of D words, several of which were consistently accompanied by unavoidable electric shock. The D words were members of implicit B-C, C-D chains, inferred from published word-association norms. In a subsequent recall test of the original A-B list, the B words that were implicitly associated with the shocked D words were forgotten significantly more often than control words."

https://openalex.org/W2092350272,"Simplified meteorological models and pollutant source configurations were used to demonstrate the types of pollutant patterns that might be encountered in the Washington, D.C.-Boston megalopolitan corridor. A semirealistic source distribution and source intensity of carbon dioxide were used in this demonstration. The results of the computations suggest that local increases in quantities of pollutants may at times require regional rather than local source consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2015979296,"Copulating male and female cicada killer wasps have distinct behavioral roles independent of reproduction. Males terminate copulation, and females initiate the copulatory flight in which the pair in copulation escape potential danger. Separation and escape behavior are mutually exclusive. Separation occurs because the female clings to the substrate and fails to join the male in his frequent attempts at flight; thus he eventually pulls free. Escape occurs when the female begins flight, which the male readily joins. Differences in thresholds for flight probably largely determine both roles. There appears to be an evolutionary balance in escape and separation behavior determined by the behavior of the female, and illustrative of behavioral homeostasis. The female remains still in the presence of mild stimuli, such as attempted male flights, and thereby aids in separation; she initiates escape in the presence of strong stimuli such as potential enemies."

https://openalex.org/W2091260218,"In concluding, I will make some personal value judgments explicit. No value judgments need enter into a comparison of inputs, nor need they intrude into comparisons of technological progress and economic growth, except in the choice of these themes for investigation, but value judgments are inevitably involved in the consideration of policy measures which may flow from such comparisons. Insofar as it represents a conscious political decision, the scale of R & D activity and support for science in any particular country reflects a variety of policy goals, only some of which are economic. Moreover, the balance of ""home"" R & D and ""imported"" science and technology must also partly reflect political and cultural, as well as more narrowly conceived economic and technological, goals. My personal preference is for a more research-oriented society, both in Britian and in Europe, but for very different policy goals than those pursued in the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. I regard the proposals being canvassed in Britain for drastically cutting back the rate of growth of fundamental and applied research as short-sighted both culturally and economically, and I believe that the real possibilities of acquiring and using American know-how will depend increasingly on strengthening Europe's own R & D capacity. But wherever the balance may lie, all countries benefit to a very considerable extent from scientific and technological exchanges. Autarchy is inefficient, both for the world economy and for world science and technology."

https://openalex.org/W2063779493,"Each year, in the US, more than 20 million tons of sulfur are discharged into the atmosphere, most of it in the form of SO/sub 2/. This gas is slowly converted into sulfuric acid, which is corrosive to many materials, including metals, building stones, and clothing. The toxicity of SO/sub 2/ and H/sub 2/SO/sub 4/ to plants and animals is controversial, as is the effect of these compounds when they are inhaled along with other components of smog. Principal targets for such restrictions are electric power generating plants. These are a major source of air pollutants when they use coal or residual oil as fuel. Five means of meeting the sulfur pollution problem seem feasible. One is to use fuel containing only small amounts of sulfur. A second is to discharge the fumes from tall smokestacks (more than 200 meters high). A third method is to add a material such as powdered limestone to the flue-gas stream, following combustion, to convert the gaseous sulfur oxides into a solid form. A fourth is to convert the coal to gas and to remove the sulfur from the gas prior to combustion. A fifth method is to pass the flue gases through amore » chemical processing plant, the sulfur being recovered in elemental form or as H/sub 2/SO/sub 4/. Both the sulfur and the H/sub 2/SO/sub 4/ are consumed on a large scale. The price of sulfur has advanced sharply during the last year and is currently quoted at close to $50 a ton. With present technology the value of the sulfur recovered from coal-fired power plants would about offset the cost of investment and operation of the processing plants. A combination of better technology with a higher price for sulfur may eventually convert a nuisance into a valued asset.« less"
