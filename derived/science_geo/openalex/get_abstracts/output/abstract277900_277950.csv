https://openalex.org/W2096459751,"At high pressures, as determined by x-ray analysis, titanium and zirconium metal have a distorted, body-centered-cubic structure. This phase persists on pressure release. The normal hexagonal close-packed structures are recovered when the metals are heated. An electronic shift must occur in the transition. Hafnium metal showed no such transition."
https://openalex.org/W2011257314,"In conventional x-ray diffraction experiments on single crystals, essentially monochromatic x-rays are used. If polychromatic x-rays derived from a synchrotron radiation spectrum are used, they generate a Laue diffraction pattern. Laue patterns from single crystals of macromolecules can be obtained in less-than 1 second, and significant radiation damage does not occur over the course of an exposure. Integrated intensities are obtained without rotation of the crystal, and individual structure factors may be extracted for most reflections. The Laue technique thus offers advantages for the recording of diffraction patterns from short-lived structural intermediates; that is, for time-resolved crystallography."
https://openalex.org/W1986025572,"Fossil worm tubes of Cretaceous age preserved in the Bayda massive sulfide deposit of the Samail ophiolite, Oman, are apparently the first documented examples of fossils embedded in massive sulfide deposits from the geologic record. The geologic setting of the Bayda deposit and the distinctive mineralogic and textural features of the fossiliferous samples suggest that the Bayda sulfide deposit and fossil fauna are remnants of a Cretaceous sea-floor hydrothermal vent similar to modern hot springs on the East Pacific Rise and the Juan de Fuca Ridge."
https://openalex.org/W2031318898,"The tomato mutant flacca wilts rapidly under water deficit because its stomata resist closure. Application of abscisic acid to intact mutant plants changes their morphology toward the phenotype of the control normal variety, Rheinlands Ruhm. The treated mutant plants do not show wilting symptoms, and the resistance to closure of their stomata decreases with hormone treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2044606869,"A late Pleistocene Artemisia steppe, implying a cool, dry climate, changed about 13,000 years ago to an oak-pistachio savanna, as the climate became warmer. About 5500 years ago the savanna thickened to an oak forest, presumably reflecting an increase in precipitation or decrease in temperature to modern levels."
https://openalex.org/W1993993573,"Optical observations, in which a microscope was used with the diamond-anvil pressure cell, were carried out on benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene up to temperatures of about 600 degrees C and pressures of approximately 40 kilobars. New high-pressure phases of benzene (benzene III) and anthracene (anthracene II) were observed, and the existence of the high-pressure polymorph, naphthalene II, was verified. All three materials decompose initially to a reddish-orange liquid, and ultimately to amorphous carbon. The decomposition temperatures decrease with increasing molecular size."
https://openalex.org/W1987435141,A circadian rhythm in the activity of luciferase is partly responsible for rhythmic bioluminescence in the dinoflagellate alga Gonyaulax polyedra. The cyclic activity of this enzyme can be attributed to a corresponding rhythm in the concentration of immunologically reactive luciferase protein. Hence protein turnover (synthesis or degradation or both) is used by the endogenous clock to control the daily rhythm of bioluminescence.
https://openalex.org/W2058674311,"Photographic observations from a network of 60 cameras in western Canada are used to derive the influx rate of meteorites on the earth's surface, the first time instrumental data have been used for this purpose. Forty-three observed events are believed to have dropped between 0.1 and 12 kilograms of meteorites each. The flux values are corrected for a minor latitude effect and agree with earlier estimates near 10 kilograms but vary more slowly with mass. Eight events per year drop at least 1 kilogram of meteorites in an area of 10(6) square kilometers."

https://openalex.org/W2153516159,"At a temperature slightly below the freezing point of an aqueous solution, the functions of a nearly perfect semipermeable membrane can be simulated with two nonselective filters with ice sandwiched between them. Potential applications include production of potable water from brackish sources or of highly purified water from tap water."
https://openalex.org/W1983086868,"Chemical studies indicate that during the first half of the history of Lake Zeribar, since about 14,800 years ago, the outlet ran very intermittently, thus resulting in a carbonate deposition and a moderate chloride content of the water. The later sediments are largely littoral and cannot easily be interpreted. A fall in exchangeable potassium at the top is probably correlated with the development of extensive beds of aquatic macrophytes. The data appear to be in harmony with those derived from pollen analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4237828646,"It is postulated that a widespread biotic zone, based on wind-blown organic materials such as pollen and oceanic albuminoids, exists in mountainous and polar regions. The aeolian zone or biome, distinct from alpine and arctic tundra, may be divided into terrestrial, nival, and aquatic divisions."
https://openalex.org/W1982828136,"Studies of the partition of trivalent gadolinium between aqueous and silicate phases have been made at temperatures from 800 degrees to 900 degrees C and at pressures from 500 to 1000 bars. Constant values for the distribution coefficients for forsterite, enstatite, and diopside were obtained over a concentration range from 0.6 part per billion to 4 parts per thousand in the solid phases. Ratios of silicate crystal-aqueous phase distribution coefficients to silicate melt-aqueous phase distribution coefficients are close to the values for silicate crystal-silicate melt distribution coefficients estimated from natural systems. The free ion activity of trivalent gadolinium in the silicate melts appears to be less than one-hundredth of its value for aqueous phases of the same concentration."

https://openalex.org/W2063873057,"The filamentous roots of mustard (Raphanus sativus), radish (Brassica nigra), squash (Cucurbita pepo), and wheat (Triticum aestivum) are covered throughout their length with living nucleated root hairs which may measure 1600 Î¼ or more. The outer walls of piliferous and nonpiliferous cells consist of successive layers of mucilage, cutin, and the cellulose-pectic framework of the cell. Plasmodesmata and pits occur on all cell walls. Under the electron microscope individual pores and pits in the microfibrillar wall are evident throughout the length of the root hair. The ""semipermeable membrane"" of the root hair zone is thus structurally complex."

https://openalex.org/W2035482802,"Present energy consumption patterns, known reserves of conventional energy sources (oil, gas, coal, and hydroelectricity), and the impact of the oil crisis on the oil-importing countries of Latin America are discussed. New approaches to energy use, including improvements on end-use efficiency, fuel substitutions, nonconventional energy sources, and changes in consumption patterns, are important. Of particular significance are the alcohol program in Brazil and the possibilities for increased use of hydroelectricity. Investments needed to sustain a reasonable increase in production from conventional energy sources up to 1990 are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2081895334,Observations of microwave noise due to rainstorms have been made at 1415 Mhz. The observed effect may well be due to electrical discharge between water droplets.
https://openalex.org/W1979747224,"Free-field ultrasonic radiation inhibited the feeding of the macrofouling hydroid Garveia franciscana by causing tentacle contraction at the sonic degasification threshold. Within the frequency range of 250 to 2000 kilohertz, the threshold sound intensity (sonic degasification threshold) that caused tentacle contraction was directly proportional to frequency, with the minimum observed being 0.6 watt per square centimeter at 250 kilohertz. A pulse length of 0.2 second and interpulse period of 102 seconds gave the lowest average power required to produce tentacle contraction at a peak pulse sound intensity of 6.2 watts per square centimeter with a frequency of 250 kilohertz. Twenty-four hour exposures to the sound regime caused destruction of the hydranths and regression of tissue in the stolons."
https://openalex.org/W2069109449,"Titrations of hydrogen-saturated montmorillonite with sodium hydroxide indicate that two kinds of hydrogen are exchanged on the surface of the clay. At low pH there is more titratable hydrogen in a fine-size fraction of the clay than there is in a coarse fraction. This indicates neutralization of hydrogen adsorbed at the crystallite edge. The hydrogen adsorbed on the interlayer flake surface is neutralized at a higher pH, and there are more titratable hydrogen ions for the coarse fraction than for the fine. This suggests that surface-charge density is a function of crystallite size, a proposal already made on the basis of other properties of clay."
