https://openalex.org/W2993347499,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act within Argonaute proteins to guide repression of messenger RNA targets. Although various approaches have provided insight into target recognition, the sparsity of miRNA-target affinity measurements has limited understanding and prediction of targeting efficacy. Here, we adapted RNA bind-n-seq to enable measurement of relative binding affinities between Argonaute-miRNA complexes and all sequences ≤12 nucleotides in length. This approach revealed noncanonical target sites specific to each miRNA, miRNA-specific differences in canonical target-site affinities, and a 100-fold impact of dinucleotides flanking each site. These data enabled construction of a biochemical model of miRNA-mediated repression, which was extended to all miRNA sequences using a convolutional neural network. This model substantially improved prediction of cellular repression, thereby providing a biochemical basis for quantitatively integrating miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks."

Huffman et al. combined designer enzymes in a multistep cascade reaction (see the Perspective by O'Reilly and Ryan). The approach eliminates purification steps, recycles expensive cofactors, and couples favorable and unfavorable reactions. With the target molecule islatravir, an experimental HIV drug, they optimized five enzymes by directed evolution to be compatible with unnatural substrates and stable in the reaction conditions. Stereochemical purity was amplified at every enzymatic step, and the final synthesis was both atom economical and efficient. Science , this issue p. 1255 ; see also p. 1199"

Srivatsan et al. now add another layer of information and complexity by combining single-cell transcriptomics with oligo hashing and small molecule screening in a method called sci-Plex. Because screening many chemical compounds requires the ability to profile many cells, and because screens perturb cells in many different ways, the authors demonstrate the effects of 188 compounds in three cancer lines. The sci-Plex method can capture gene expression profiles from thousands of experimental conditions in a single experiment. Science , this issue p. 45"

Most research has focused on defects in diamond, which are difficult to integrate with existing semiconductor technologies. An alternative two-vacancy neutral defect in silicon carbide (SiC) has a long coherence time but suffers from broad optical linewidths and charge instability. Anderson et al. fabricated these defects in a diode made out of commercially available SiC. Reverse voltage created large electric fields within the diode, tuning the frequencies of the defect's transitions by hundreds of gigahertz. The electric fields also caused charge depletion, leading to a dramatic narrowing of the transitions. The technique should be readily generalizable to other quantum defects.

Betts et al. present a global analysis of how exposure to habitat fragmentation affects the composition of ecological communities (see the Perspective by Hargreaves). In a dataset consisting of 4489 animal species, regions that historically experienced little disturbance tended to harbor a higher proportion of species vulnerable to fragmentation. Species in more frequently disturbed regions were more resilient. High-latitude areas historically experienced more disturbance and harbor more resilient species, which suggests that extinction has removed fragmentation-sensitive species. Thus, conservation efforts to limit fragmentation are particularly important in the tropics. Science , this issue p. 1236 ; see also p. 1196"

Lauretta and Hergenrother et al. describe close-range observations of mass loss on the near-Earth asteroid Bennu (see the Perspective by Agarwal). Shortly after arriving at Bennu, navigation cameras on the OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security—Regolith Explorer) spacecraft detected objects 1 to 10 centimeters in diameter moving above the surface. Analysis of the objects' trajectories showed that they originated in discrete ejection events from otherwise unremarkable locations on Bennu. Some objects remained in orbit for several days, whereas others escaped into interplanetary space. The authors suggest multiple plausible mechanisms that could underlie this activity.

https://openalex.org/W2991642412,"Summary During speech listening, the brain could use contextual predictions to optimize sensory sampling and processing. We asked if such predictive processing is organized dynamically into separate oscillatory timescales. We trained a neural network that uses context to predict speech at the phoneme level. Using this model, we estimated contextual uncertainty and surprise of natural speech as factors to explain neurophysiological activity in human listeners. We show, first, that speech-related activity is hierarchically organized into two timescales: fast responses (theta: 4–10 Hz), restricted to early auditory regions, and slow responses (delta: 0.5–4 Hz), dominating in downstream auditory regions. Neural activity in these bands is selectively modulated by predictions: the gain of early theta responses varies according to the contextual uncertainty of speech, while later delta responses are selective to surprising speech inputs. We conclude that theta sensory sampling is tuned to maximize expected information gain, while delta encodes only non-redundant information. Video Abstract Download : Download video (116MB)"

A successful vaccine would need to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that are capable of neutralizing multiple HIV strains (see the Perspective by Agazio and Torres). Steichen et al. report a strategy in which the first vaccine shot can lead to immune responses that generate desired bnAbs. By combining knowledge of human antibody repertoires and structure to guide design, they validated candidate immunogens through functional preclinical testing. Saunders et al. designed immunogens with differences in binding strength for bnAb precursors, which enabled selection of rare mutations after immunization. The immunogens promoted bnAb precursor maturation in humanized mice and macaques. Science , this issue p. eaax4380 , p. eaay7199 ; see also p. 1197"

https://openalex.org/W2994423700,"Ion fluxes resolve organellar volume Animal cells continuously sample the surrounding medium, a feature accentuated in immune cells. Sampling is accomplished by trapping external medium into membrane-bound vesicles or vacuoles. These structures are promptly resolved, thus avoiding accumulation of endomembranes and volume expansion. In a variety of cultured cells, Freeman et al. found that this resolution entails conversion of spherical vacuoles into thin tubules, a process that involves marked changes in surface-to-volume ratio (see the Perspective by King and Smythe). Shrinkage of membrane-bound structures is driven by ion fluxes and subsequent osmotic transfer of water. Shriveled vacuoles attract curvature-sensing proteins that promote the extension of fine tubules. Ion channels thereby control membrane remodeling, enabling receptor recycling and proper routing of cellular cargo. Science , this issue p. 301 ; see also p. 246"

https://openalex.org/W3102884354,"Ultrafast spectroscopies have become an important tool for elucidating the microscopic description and dynamical properties of quantum materials. In particular, by tracking the dynamics of non-thermal electrons, a material's dominant scattering processes -- and thus the many-body interactions between electrons and collective excitations -- can be revealed. Here we present a new method for extracting the electron-phonon coupling strength in the time domain, by means of time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES). This method is demonstrated in graphite, where we investigate the dynamics of photo-injected electrons at the K point, detecting quantized energy-loss processes that correspond to the emission of strongly-coupled optical phonons. We show that the observed characteristic timescale for spectral-weight-transfer mediated by phonon-scattering processes allows for the direct quantitative extraction of electron-phonon matrix elements, for specific modes, and with unprecedented sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2991747527,"Regulating synaptic signals In the brain, AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are ion channels that play key roles in synaptic plasticity, cognition, learning, and memory. Two classes of subunits, the claudin family and the cornichon family, regulate AMPAR gating and trafficking. Previous structures have been presented of AMPAR bound to claudin homologs. Now, Nakagawa reports a high-resolution structure of AMPAR bound to the cornichon homolog CNIH3, determined by cryo–electron microscopy (see the Perspective by Schwenk and Fakler). In contrast to a predicted topology of three transmembrane helices and an intracellular amino terminus, CNIH3 has four transmembrane helices, and both the amino and carboxyl termini are extracellular. The structure reveals the architecture of the interaction interface between AMPAR and CNIH3 and suggests a role for lipids in regulating the assembly and function of the AMPAR-CNIH3 complex.

https://openalex.org/W2991351351,"The connectomes of organisms of the same species show remarkable architectural and often local wiring similarity, raising the question: where and how is neuronal connectivity encoded? Here, we start from the hypothesis that the genetic identity of neurons guides synapse and gap-junction formation and show that such genetically driven wiring predicts the existence of specific biclique motifs in the connectome. We identify a family of large, statistically significant biclique subgraphs in the connectomes of three species and show that within many of the observed bicliques the neurons share statistically significant expression patterns and morphological characteristics, supporting our expectation of common genetic factors that drive the synapse formation within these subgraphs. The proposed connectome model offers a self-consistent framework to link the genetics of an organism to the reproducible architecture of its connectome, offering experimentally falsifiable predictions on the genetic factors that drive the formation of individual neuronal circuits."

https://openalex.org/W2990290931,"The timing and size of inhibition are crucial for dynamic excitation-inhibition balance and information processing in the neocortex. The underlying mechanism for temporal control of inhibition remains unclear. We performed dual whole-cell recordings from pyramidal cells (PCs) and nearby inhibitory interneurons in layer 5 of rodent neocortical slices. We found asynchronous release (AR) of glutamate occurs at PC output synapses onto Martinotti cells (MCs), causing desynchronized and prolonged firing in MCs and thus imprecise and long-lasting inhibition in neighboring PCs. AR is much stronger at PC-MC synapses as compared with those onto fast-spiking cells and other PCs, and it is also dependent on PC subtypes, with crossed-corticostriatal PCs producing the strongest AR. Moreover, knocking out synaptotagmin-7 substantially reduces AR strength and recurrent inhibition. Our results highlight the effect of glutamate AR on the operation of microcircuits mediating slow recurrent inhibition, an important mechanism for controlling the timing and size of cortical inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2992552168,"Deleted-in-liver cancer 1 (DLC1) exerts its tumor suppressive function mainly through the Rho-GTPase–activating protein (RhoGAP) domain. When activated, the domain promotes the hydrolysis of RhoA-GTP, leading to reduced cell migration. DLC1 is kept in an inactive state by an intramolecular interaction between its RhoGAP domain and the DLC1 sterile α motif (SAM) domain. We have shown previously that this autoinhibited state of DLC1 may be alleviated by tensin-3 (TNS3) or PTEN. We show here that the TNS3/PTEN-DLC1 interactions are mediated by the C2 domains of the former and the SAM domain of the latter. Intriguingly, the DLC1 SAM domain was capable of binding to specific peptide motifs within the C2 domains. Indeed, peptides containing the binding motifs were highly effective in blocking the C2-SAM domain-domain interaction. Importantly, when fused to the tat protein-transduction sequence and subsequently introduced into cells, the C2 peptides potently promoted the RhoGAP function in DLC1, leading to decreased RhoA activation and reduced tumor cell growth in soft agar and migration in response to growth factor stimulation. To facilitate the development of the C2 peptides as potential therapeutic agents, we created a cyclic version of the TNS3 C2 domain-derived peptide and showed that this peptide readily entered the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and effectively inhibited their migration.

Therefore, the DLC1 SAM domain is a protein interaction module capable of binding to a variety of different proteins. Intriguingly, binding of TNS3 to the DLC1 SAM domain blocks interaction of the latter with the RhoGAP domain, thereby promoting RhoGAP activity and resulting in decreased cellular RhoA-GTP levels (10Cao X. Kaneko T. Li J.S. Liu A.D. Voss C. Li S.S. A phosphorylation switch controls the spatiotemporal activation of Rho GTPases in directional cell migration.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26166433): 772110.1038/ncomms8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that targeting the SAM domain-mediated protein-protein interactions may be an attractive strategy to control cell migration by manipulating cellular RhoA-GTP levels via DLC1. We report here that the DLC1 SAM domain binds directly to the TNS3 and PTEN C2 domains. Using peptide-walking arrays, we defined the regions in the two C2 domains that mediate SAM-binding and identified specific peptides that bound the SAM domain with micromolar affinities. Our work show, for the first time, the SAM domain is a peptide-interaction module that is capable of binding to multiple peptides derived from TNS3 and PTEN. Importantly, we provide evidence showing that the TNS3 or PTEN C2 domain-derived peptides can inhibit anchorage-independent cell growth and the migration of a variety of cancer cells in response to growth factor stimulation. We have previously shown that the DLC1 SAM domain is capable of binding to PTEN and TNS3 through a homologous region (10Cao X. Kaneko T. Li J.S. Liu A.D. Voss C. Li S.S. A phosphorylation switch controls the spatiotemporal activation of Rho GTPases in directional cell migration.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26166433): 772110.1038/ncomms8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 11Cao X. Voss C. Zhao B. Kaneko T. Li S.S.

Binding by TNS3 or PTEN may activate DLC1 by releasing the intramolecular interaction between the SAM and RhoGAP domains, thereby resulting in increased RhoGAP activity, decreased Rho-GTP level, and reduced cell migration (Fig. 1A). To exploit this mechanism to control cell migration, we first examined if the homologous C2 domains in TNS3 and PTEN would bind directly to the DLC1 SAM domain. To this end, we transfected HEK293 cells with expression constructs for the TNS3-C2 or PTEN-C2 domain fused to green fluorescence protein (GFP) together with the FLAG epitope-tagged DLC1, the SAM domain, or a DLC1 mutant in which the SAM domain was deleted (DLC1-ΔSAM). Immunoprecipitation of the GFP-C2 domains followed by Western blotting showed that both the full-length DLC1 and the SAM domain co-immunoprecipitated with the TNS3 or PTEN C2 domain, whereas DLC1-ΔSAM did not (Fig. 1B). This indicates that the SAM domain is required for DLC1 binding to the C2 domain. The SAM-C2 domain-domain interaction may be mediated by peptide motifs as is often the case for protein interaction modules (26Li S.S. Specificity and versatility of SH3 and other proline-recognition domains: structural basis and implications for cellular signal transduction.Biochem. J. 2005; 390 (16134966): 641-65310.1042/BJ20050411Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, we synthesized peptide spot arrays representing the amino acid (aa) sequences of the PTEN and TNS3 C2 domains, respectively. Each peptide in the spot array is 12-aa in length with 2-aa overlap between neighboring peptides in the array (Fig. S1, A and B). The peptide arrays were subsequently probed for binding to the purified GST-SAM (Fig. 2A) or GST (for background binding, Fig. S2) and the bound protein visualized by anti-GST Western blots. This led to the identification of three distinct regions in the PTEN-C2 domain, with the 230GPTR, 257FFHK, and 334NRYF motifs, respectively, that were recognized by the DLC1-SAM domain (Fig. 2, A, upper panel, and B). In contrast, only a single motif on the TNS3-C2 domain, 244CYHK, was recognized by the SAM domain (Fig. 2, A, lower panel, and B). Intriguingly, this motif shares significant sequence identify to the 257FFHK motif in PTEN-C2 (Fig. 2B), suggesting similar mechanisms may be used by both C2 domains for SAM-binding. Although the C2 peptide arrays included phosphorylated versions of the bound peptides, none was found to bind the DLC1-SAM domain (white boxes in Fig. 2A; Fig. S1, A and B). The SAM-binding peptides mapped to specific β-strands or surface loops at one side of the PTEN-C2 structure (Fig. 2C). Although the TNS3-C2 domain structure is not yet available, it should be noted that the 244CYHK peptide from TNS3-C2 aligns with the 257FFHK motif of PTEN-C2 domain (Fig. 2, B and C). To measure the binding affinities of the identified C2 peptides for the SAM domain in solution, we synthesized peptides representing the different motifs with a fluorescein tag. Fluorescence polarization binding assays were conducted for the peptide-SAM complexes and the equilibrium binding curves were used to derive the corresponding dissociation constants (KD) (Fig. 2, D and E; Table 1; Fig. S3). The strongest interaction was observed for the 230GPTR motif-containing peptide from PTEN-C2 (called the PTEN-C2 peptide for short hereafter) with KD of 0.87 μm (Fig. 2D; Table 1). In contrast, the 244CYHK motif-containing peptide (called the TNS3-C2 peptide hereafter) had a KD of 2.18 μm (Fig. 2E; Table 1), which is ∼7-fold stronger than the equivalent 257FFHK peptide from the PTEN-C2 domain (Fig. 2B; Table 1). A peptide containing the other PTEN-C2 motif, 334NRYF, was much weaker in binding, with a KD of 25.87 μm, (Table 1; Fig. S3A). To rule out that the interaction was disulfide bond-dependent, a 244SYHK motif-containing variant of the TNS3-C2 peptide was also synthesized and tested for binding, which showed a minor change in affinity (KD = 3.58 μm) compared with the 244CYHK peptide (Table 1; Fig. S3A).Table 1Equilibrium dissociation constants for the SAM-C2 peptide interactionsPeptide (Sequence)KDaKD values were derived from fluorescence polarization measurements.μmTNS3-C2 peptide (CYHKKYRSATRD)2.18 ± 0.45244TNS3-C2 (Cys244-Ser) (SYHKKYRSATRD)3.58 ± 1.09PTEN-C2 peptide (GPTRREDKFMYF)0.87 ± 0.18PTEN-C2-FFHK (FFHKQNKMLKKD)14.05 ± 1.51PTEN-C2-NRYF (NRYFSPNFKVKLY)25.87 ± 2.87a KD values were derived from fluorescence polarization measurements. Open table in a new tab The importance of the 244CYHK and 230GPTR motifs for SAM-binding was investigated by Ala-scanning peptide spot arrays. The N-terminal half of each peptide was found to play an important role as substitution of any residue within this region led to a marked decrease or loss of SAM-binding (Fig. S4, A and B). To confirm this finding, we synthesized analogues of the C2 peptides in which the 2nd and 3rd residues in the two motifs were substituted by Ala. Fluorescence polarization assay showed that the resulting peptides, containing the GAAR or CAAK motif, lost binding to SAM (Fig. S4, C and D). To find out if the two C2 peptides could inhibit the corresponding SAM-C2 interaction in cells, we resynthesized these peptides with an N-terminal, HIV-derived tat-motif (27Bechara C. Sagan S. Cell-penetrating peptides: 20 years later, where do we stand?.FEBS Lett. 2013; 587 (23669356): 1693-170210.1016/j.febslet.2013.04.031Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) to facilitate cellular transduction and a fluorescein tag for easy detection. We also synthesized a scrambled version of the fluorescein-tat-TNS3-C2 peptide as control. The tat-peptides were able to transduce the MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer), HCC78 (lung cancer), and HEK293DLC1 (HEK293 overexpressing DLC1) cells with equal efficiency (Fig. S5) and the transduced peptides appeared as punctate structures that colocalized with actin (Fig. S6). With confirmation of cellular transduction, we then tested if the C2 peptides could block the interaction between GFP-TNS3-C2 or GFP-PTEN-C2 and GST-DLC1-SAM that were co-expressed in the HEK293DLC1 cells. To this end, we first established the conditions for binding between the SAM and two C2 domains. In agreement with previous findings (10Cao X. Kaneko T. Li J.S. Liu A.D. Voss C. Li S.S. A phosphorylation switch controls the spatiotemporal activation of Rho GTPases in directional cell migration.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26166433): 772110.1038/ncomms8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), GST pulldown showed that the SAM domain bound more robustly to the TNS3-C2 domain in the absence, than in the presence, of EGF in serum-starved HEK293DLC1 cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the SAM-PTEN-C2 interaction was stronger in the presence of EGF stimulation (Fig. 3C). This discrepancy may be due to the distinct effect of phosphorylation of the two C2 domains on SAM-binding (10Cao X. Kaneko T. Li J.S. Liu A.D. Voss C. Li S.S. A phosphorylation switch controls the spatiotemporal activation of Rho GTPases in directional cell migration.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26166433): 772110.1038/ncomms8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To assess the efficacy of the C2 peptides in disrupting the SAM-C2 interaction, an incremental amount of a fluoscein-tat-C2 peptide was added to the cells in the absence or presence of EGF followed by GST pulldown. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the TNS3-C2 peptide blocked TNS3-C2 binding to the SAM domain at a concentration as low as 5 μm, whereas the PTEN-C2 peptide exhibited a significant inhibitory effect only at 10 μm or above (Fig. 3, A and B). Intriguingly, in the presence of EGF, the PTEN-C2 peptide disrupted SAM-binding by the PTEN-C2 domain at 5 μm, whereas the TNS3-C2 peptide was unable to completely inhibit the SAM-C2 domain-domain interaction even at 15 μm (Fig. 3, C and D). The scrambled TNS3-C2 peptide control, in contrast, was unable to block SAM binding to either C2 domain even at 30 μm regardless of EGF. These results indicate that the C2 peptides have distinct abilities in disrupting SAM-binding to the corresponding C2 domains. Nevertheless, at high peptide concentrations (e.g. 30 μm), both peptides are effective in blocking the SAM-C2 interactions. Because the TNS3-C2 domain can act as inhibitor of cell migration (10Cao X. Kaneko T. Li J.S. Liu A.D. Voss C. Li S.S. A phosphorylation switch controls the spatiotemporal activation of Rho GTPases in directional cell migration.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26166433): 772110.1038/ncomms8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), apparently by binding to the SAM domain and mitigating its inhibition of DLC1-RhoGAP, we inquired whether the C2 peptides were sufficient to activate the RhoGAP and thereby, promoting RhoA-GTP hydrolysis (10Cao X. Kaneko T. Li J.S. Liu A.D. Voss C. Li S.S. A phosphorylation switch controls the spatiotemporal activation of Rho GTPases in directional cell migration.Nat.

To this end, the HEK293DLC1 cells were cultured in serum-free and EGF-containing medium with increasing concentrations of a C2 peptide (from 0 to 18 μm) or scrambled control (at 18 μm). Rhotekin-RBD beads were used to pulldown GTP-bound RhoA from the cell lysate followed by anti-RhoA Western blotting (10Cao X. Kaneko T. Li J.S. Liu A.D. Voss C. Li S.S. A phosphorylation switch controls the spatiotemporal activation of Rho GTPases in directional cell migration.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26166433): 772110.1038/ncomms8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although both C2 peptides were capable of blocking RhoA activation at 18 μm, the PTEN-C2 peptide was more effective as it abolished cellular GTP-RhoA at 10 μm (Fig. 4A). This result is consistent with the finding above (Fig. 3, C and D) showing that the PTEN-C2 peptide inhibited the C2-SAM interaction more effectively than the TNS3-C2 peptide in the presence of EGF. To ascertain that the inhibitory effect of the C2 peptide on RhoA activation was not limited to the specific cell type or growth factor examined, we repeated the assay on MDA-MB-231 (a breast cancer line) under EGF stimulation and HCC78 (a lung cancer line) under the treatment of HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) and obtained essentially identical results (Fig. 4, B and C). It should be noted that the peptide treatment did not alter the cellular level of DLC1 in any of three cell lines tested (Fig. 4A; Fig. S7). Furthermore, the C2 peptides had no effect on Rac1 activation (Fig. S8), consistent with DLC1 being a Rho-specific GAP. Because RhoA is known to play a role in tumori"

The conventional use of grain color as a proxy to indirectly select against or for antioxidants polyphenols in sorghum grain was hampered by the lack of consistency between grain color and the expected antioxidants concentration. Marker-assisted selection built upon significant loci identified through linkage disequilibrium studies showed interesting potential in several plant breeding and animal husbandry programs, and can be used in sorghum breeding for consumer-tailored antioxidant production. The purpose of this work was therefore to conduct genome-wide association study of sorghum grain antioxidants using single nucleotide polymorphisms in a novel diversity panel of Sorghum bicolor landraces and S. bicolor × S. halepense recombinant inbred lines. The recombinant inbred lines outperformed landraces for antioxidant production and contributed novel polymorphism. Antioxidant traits were highly correlated and showed very high broad-sense heritability. The genome-wide association analysis uncovered 96 associations 55 of which were major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) explaining 15 to 31% of the observed antioxidants variability. Eight major QTLs localized in novel chromosomal regions. Twenty-four pleiotropic major effect markers and two novel functional markers (Chr9_1550093, Chr10_50169631) were discovered. A novel pleiotropic major effect marker (Chr1_61095994) explained the highest proportion (R2 = 27–31%) of the variance observed in most traits evaluated in this work, and was in linkage disequilibrium with a hotspot of 19 putative glutathione S-transferase genes conjugating anthocyanins into vacuoles. On chromosome four, a hotspot region was observed involving major effect markers linked with putative MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex genes involved in the biosynthesis of the polyphenol class of flavonoids. The findings in this work are expected to help the scientific community particularly involved in marker assisted breeding for the development of sorghum cultivars with consumer-tailored antioxidants concentration."

https://openalex.org/W2993286068,"Cells employ a vast network of regulatory pathways to manage intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). An effectual means used by cells to control these regulatory systems are sulfur-based redox switches, which consist of protein cysteine or methionine residues that become transiently oxidized when intracellular ROS levels increase. Here, we describe a methionine-based oxidation event involving the yeast cytoplasmic Hsp70 co-chaperone Fes1. We show that Fes1 undergoes reversible methionine oxidation during excessively-oxidizing cellular conditions, and we map the site of this oxidation to a cluster of three methionine residues in the Fes1 core domain. Making use of recombinant proteins and a variety of in vitro assays, we establish that oxidation inhibits Fes1 activity and, correspondingly, alters Hsp70 activity. Moreover, we demonstrate in vitro and in cells that Fes1 oxidation is reversible and is regulated by the cytoplasmic methionine sulfoxide reductase Mxr1 (MsrA) and a previously unidentified cytoplasmic pool of the reductase Mxr2 (MsrB). We speculate that inactivation of Fes1 activity during excessively-oxidizing conditions may help maintain protein-folding homeostasis in a suboptimal cellular folding environment. The characterization of Fes1 oxidation during cellular stress provides a new perspective as to how the activities of the cytoplasmic Hsp70 chaperones may be attuned by fluctuations in cellular ROS levels and provides further insight into how cells use methionine-based redox switches to sense and respond to oxidative stress."

https://openalex.org/W2992680591,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. Recent studies demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in the development of congenital heart defects (CHD). In this study, we aimed at identifying the specific patterns of miRNAs in blood of monozygotic twin pairs discordant for CHD and to assess whether miRNAs might be involved in the development or reflect the consequences of CHD. Methods miRNA microarray analysis and Real-Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were employed to determine the miRNA abundance level from 12 monozygotic twins discordant for CHD and their non-CHD co-twins (n = 12). Enrichment analyses of altered miRNAs were performed using bioinformatics tools. Results Compared with non-CHD co-twins, profiling analysis indicated 34 miRNAs with a significant difference in abundance level (p<0.05, fold change ≥ 1.3), of which 11 miRNAs were up-regulated and 23 miRNAs were down-regulated. Seven miRNAs were validated with RT-qPCR including miR-511-3p, miR-1306-5p, miR-421, miR-4707-3p, miR-4732-3p, miR-5189-3p, and miR-890, and the results were consistent with microarray analysis. Five miRNAs namely miR-511-3p, miR-1306-5p, miR-4732-3p, miR-5189-3p, and miR-890 were found to be significantly up-regulated in twins < 10 years old. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the 7 validated miRNAs were involved in phosphatidylinositol signaling, gap junction signaling, and adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes. Conclusions Our data show deregulated miRNA abundance levels in the peripheral blood of monozygotic twins discordant for CHD, and identify new candidates for further analysis, which may contribute to understanding the development of CHD in the future. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the target genes of these miRNAs are likely involved in signaling and communication of cardiomyocytes."

However, it can also provide a mechanism to transfer their quantum state over larger distances. Here, we demonstrate such a form of teleportation, across a metallic island within which the electrons are trapped much longer than their quantum lifetime. This effect originates from the low temperature freezing of the island's charge $Q$ which, in the presence of a single connected electronic channel, enforces a one-to-one correspondence between incoming and outgoing electrons. Such high-fidelity quantum state imprinting is established between well-separated injection and emission locations, through two-path interferences in the integer quantum Hall regime.

However, the functional properties of the TWIK-1 (K2P1.1/KCNK1) K2P channel remain poorly characterized because heterologous expression of this ion channel yields only very low levels of functional activity. Several underlying reasons have been proposed, including TWIK-1 retention in intracellular organelles, inhibition by posttranslational sumoylation, a hydrophobic barrier within the pore, and a low open probability of the selectivity filter (SF) gate. By evaluating these potential mechanisms, we found that the latter dominates the low intrinsic functional activity of TWIK-1. Investigating this further, we observed that the low activity of the SF gate appears to arise from the inefficiency of K+ in stabilizing an active (i.e. conductive) SF conformation. In contrast, other permeant ion species, such as Rb+, NH4+, and Cs+, strongly promoted a pH-dependent activated conformation. Furthermore, many K2P channels are activated by membrane depolarization via an SF-mediated gating mechanism, but we found here that only very strong nonphysiological depolarization produces voltage-dependent activation of heterologously expressed TWIK-1. Remarkably, we also observed that TWIK-1 Rb+ currents are potently inhibited by intracellular K+ (IC50 = 2.8 mm). We conclude that TWIK-1 displays unique SF gating properties among the family of K2P channels. In particular, the apparent instability of the conductive conformation of the TWIK-1 SF in the presence of K+ appears to dominate the low levels of intrinsic functional activity observed when the channel is expressed at the cell surface.

K+ channels represent a structurally unique family of channels involved in diverse physiological functions such as cell volume regulation, apoptosis, vasodilation, central chemosensitivity, neuronal excitability, and perception of pain.

However, understanding the biophysical, pharmacological, and functional properties of TWIK-1 has proven difficult because of the extremely low levels of functional activity observed when the WT channel is recombinantly expressed in heterologous systems such as Xenopus oocytes or cultured mammalian cells (e.g. HEK293) that are typically used for electrophysiological recordings of ion channels. The precise reasons underlying these low levels of functional activity remain unclear. Originally, it was suggested that posttranslational modification (sumoylation) of a lysine residue (Lys274) within the proximal C terminus was responsible for its apparent lack of functional activity (8Rajan S. Plant L.D. Rabin M.L. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A. Sumoylation silences the plasma membrane leak K+ channel K2P1.Cell. 2005; 121 (15820677): 37-4710.1016/j.cell.2005.01.019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The structure of TWIK-1 revealed Lys274 to be located within an amphipathic interfacial “C-helix” structure kinked parallel to the membrane, close to the intracellular entrance to the pore (9Miller A.N. Long S.B. Crystal structure of the human two-pore domain potassium channel K2P1.Science. 2012; 335 (22282804): 432-43610.1126/science.1213274Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying the increased activity seen with mutations at Lys274 within the C-helix remain controversial (10Feliciangeli S. Bendahhou S. Sandoz G. Gounon P. Reichold M. Warth R. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. Lesage F. Does sumoylation control K2P1/TWIK1 background K+ channels?.Cell. 2007; 130 (17693262): 563-56910.1016/j.cell.2007.06.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A subsequent study of WT TWIK-1 channels revealed that they are actively and constitutively internalized from the cell surface and that mutation of an endocytic motif within the intracellular C-terminal domain can reduce this internalization to increase channel levels within the plasma membrane (11Feliciangeli S. Tardy M.P. Sandoz G. Chatelain F.C. Warth R. Barhanin J. Bendahhou S. Lesage F. Potassium channel silencing by constitutive endocytosis and intracellular sequestration.J. Biol.

However, even when engineered to reside on the cell surface in greater numbers, these “WT” TWIK-1 channels still exhibit very low levels of functional activity compared with many other members of the K2P channel family. Exploiting this approach to stabilize TWIK-1 within the plasma membrane, it was also found that larger TWIK-1 currents can be produced by mutation of hydrophobic residues that form a “hydrophobic cuff” within the inner pore of the channel (e.g. Leu146). This cuff creates a hydrophobic barrier that restricts hydration of the inner cavity below the selectivity filter (12Aryal P. Abd-Wahab F. Bucci G. Sansom M.S. Tucker S.J.

However, the precise role of this barrier also remains unclear because, in addition to its effect on pore hydration, mutation of residues that form this barrier may also indirectly affect other aspects of K2P channel gating (16Ben Soussia I.

Another unusual structural feature of the TWIK-1 channel is its highly asymmetric and noncanonical selectivity filter (SF). By nature of their dimeric architecture, all K2P channels exhibit a two-fold symmetry and have a SF formed from nonidentical sequences, but for TWIK-1, there are also major variations in the canonical TXGY/FG sequence, with TTGYG in the first P-loop and TIGLG in the second. Furthermore, the channel has been shown to exhibit dynamic ion selectivity with reduced K+>Na+ selectivity that can be modulated by mutations either within or close to the first P-loop (15Chatelain F.C.

Interestingly, this dynamic ion selectivity is thought to be relevant for regulation of cardiac excitability under conditions of hypokalemia (5Goldstein S.A.

In most other K2P channels, the SF also represents the main site for channel gating and the origin of their voltage sensitivity (19Bagriantsev S.N. Peyronnet R. Clark K.A. Honoré E. Minor Jr., D.L. Multiple modalities converge on a common gate to control K2P channel function.EMBO J. 2011; 30 (21765396): 3594-360610.1038/emboj.2011.230Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Ben-Abu Y.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that this voltage-dependent gating originates from the movement of ions into the high electric field of the SF to generate a one-way “check valve” within the filter, where the outward movement of K+ induces filter opening and inward movement promotes channel closure. The gating process is also highly dependent on the nature of the permeant ion (23Schewe M. Nematian-Ardestani E. Sun H. Musinszki M. Cordeiro S. Bucci G. de Groot B.L. Tucker S.J. Rapedius M. Baukrowitz T. A non-canonical voltage-sensing mechanism controls gating in K2P K+ channels.Cell. 2016; 164 (26919430): 937-94910.1016/j.cell.2016.02.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, at that time, the relevance of this filter gating mechanism to TWIK-1 was not examined because of its apparent linear current–voltage behavior within the physiological voltage range. Nevertheless, it has been shown previously that macroscopic TWIK-1 currents could be recorded when Rb+ was used as the permeant ion (12Aryal P. Abd-Wahab F. Bucci G. Sansom M.S. Tucker S.J. A hydrophobic barrier deep within the inner pore of the TWIK-1 K2P potassium channel.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (25001086): 437710.1038/ncomms5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Ma L.

In this study, we therefore sought to understand the extent to which these different possible mechanisms contribute to the low levels of functional activity associated with TWIK-1. We found that TWIK-1 does indeed possess a filter gate that displays characteristics markedly different from most other K2P channels and that this appears to be the principal reason why TWIK-1 produces very low levels of channel activity when expressed heterologously. To begin to evaluate the effect of these different mechanisms, we first examined the role of the C-helix. A lysine residue within the C-helix (Lys274) has been proposed to be a site for posttranslational sumoylation that silences TWIK-1 activity (8Rajan S. Plant L.D. Rabin M.L. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A. Sumoylation silences the plasma membrane leak K+ channel K2P1.Cell. 2005; 121 (15820677): 37-4710.1016/j.cell.2005.01.019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, the C-helix also contains a number of other charged residues. We therefore conducted a scanning mutagenesis of the C-helix and compared the levels of activity produced when these mutant channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Constitutive endocytosis has been reported previously to reduce the levels of TWIK-1 within the plasma membrane (11Feliciangeli S. Tardy M.P. Sandoz G. Chatelain F.C. Warth R. Barhanin J. Bendahhou S. Lesage F. Potassium channel silencing by constitutive endocytosis and intracellular sequestration.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 (19959478): 4798-480510.1074/jbc.M109.078535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Chatelain F.C. Bichet D. Douguet D. Feliciangeli S. Bendahhou S.

Therefore, to permit measurement of larger currents, all mutations were created in a background construct where the di-isoleucine retention motif was mutated (I293A/I294A). This site is located within the cytoplasmic domain and is consistent with many previous studies of TWIK-1; this trafficking mutant (hereafter referred to as TWIK-1*) was used throughout this study to measure channel activity. As reported previously (12Aryal P. Abd-Wahab F. Bucci G. Sansom M.S. Tucker S.J. A hydrophobic barrier deep within the inner pore of the TWIK-1 K2P potassium channel.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (25001086): 437710.1038/ncomms5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we found that mutation of Lys274 in TWIK-1* caused an increase in whole-cell currents. However, although we found that most other mutations in the C-helix had little effect, mutation of two other charged residues (Arg277 and Lys278) also increased the level of whole-cell current activity (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). Interestingly, when mapped onto the structure of the C-helix, these three charged residues were observed to face toward the entrance of the inner cavity. By contrast, mutation of adjacent charged residues (e.g. Glu272 and Lys275) that face away from the pore had no such effect (Fig. 1, A and B). The precise mechanisms responsible for the increased activity of these pore-facing mutations remains unclear and likely involves multiple factors. However, the fact that these three pore-facing mutants were all able to increase macroscopic current levels to the same levels as mutation of Lys274 strongly suggests that the role of Lys274 in “silencing” this channel may not be as unique as thought previously. Importantly, and consistent with previous reports, the increase in currents seen with these C-helix mutants is also relatively small compared with the much bigger effect of mutations within the hydrophobic cuff of the inner pore, e.g. the L146N mutation in M2 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we have also shown that both WT TWIK-1* and L146N mutant channels produce even larger macroscopic currents when Rb+ is used as the permeant ion (12Aryal P. Abd-Wahab F. Bucci G. Sansom M.S. Tucker S.J. A hydrophobic barrier deep within the inner pore of the TWIK-1 K2P potassium channel.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (25001086): 437710.1038/ncomms5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This indicates that the low levels of TWIK-1* activity typically observed when the channel is expressed can only partly be accounted for by the C-helix, and the intrinsic biophysical properties of the SF are likely to play a more dominant role in this process. Our previous studies identified an ion flux–gating mechanism within the SF of many different subfamilies of K2P channels (23Schewe M. Nematian-Ardestani E. Sun H. Musinszki M. Cordeiro S. Bucci G. de Groot B.L. Tucker S.J. Rapedius M. Baukrowitz T. A non-canonical voltage-sensing mechanism controls gating in K2P K+ channels.Cell. 2016; 164 (26919430): 937-94910.1016/j.cell.2016.02.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but its contribution to TWIK-1 gating remains unclear. We therefore next examined how the SF gate contributes to the unusual functional properties of TWIK-1. When K+ is used as the permeant ion with either WT TWIK-1 or TWIK-1*, relatively little current can normally be recorded above background levels within a physiological voltage range (i.e. −100 to +100 mV) (4Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. TWIK-1, a ubiquitous human weakly inward rectifying K+ channel with a novel structure.EMBO J. 1996; 15 (8605869): 1004-101110.1002/j.1460-2075.1996.tb00437.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 23Schewe M.

However, Fig. 2A shows that, in excised patches, strong depolarization in excess of +100 mV begins to elicit measurable K+ currents compared with uninjected controls. These currents display similar time- and voltage-dependent activation properties observed in other K2P channels, such as TREK-1 and TRAAK. However, unlike these other K2P channels, the threshold for this activation is shifted to >100 mV, highlighting the unusual flux-gating properties of the SF gate in TWIK-1*. When Rb+ is used as the permeant ion in TREK and TRAAK channels, it activates the SF ion flux gating mechanism within the SF by stabilization of its active configuration (23Schewe M. Nematian-Ardestani E. Sun H. Musinszki M. Cordeiro S. Bucci G. de Groot B.L. Tucker S.J. Rapedius M. Baukrowitz T. A non-canonical voltage-sensing mechanism controls gating in K2P K+ channels.Cell. 2016; 164 (26919430): 937-94910.1016/j.cell.2016.02.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Schewe M.

Consistent with this, we also observed that Rb+ is capable of producing large currents in inside-out macropatches excised from Xenopus oocytes expressing WT TWIK-1*. These currents were also activated at less depolarized potentials than required to generate K+ currents (Fig. 2B). This suggests that K+ is much less efficient than Rb+ in stabilizing the SF in an actively conductive configuration. Fig. 2B also highlights the relative importance of the endocytotic retention motif because, when the retention motif is present (i.e. WT TWIK-1), then the currents are markedly smaller, even with Rb+ as the permeant ion. The ability to record robust Rb+ currents from WT TWIK-1* therefore provides an opportunity for a more detailed biophysical investigation of the intrinsic gating properties of this unusual K2P channel. In the excised macropatch recordings described above, Rb+ is applied intracellularly, and its activatory effect is consistent with the intracellular effects of Rb+ seen for many other K2P channels. However, consistent with previous reports (17Ma L. Xie Y.P. Zhou M. Chen H. Silent TWIK-1 potassium channels conduct monovalent cation currents.Biophys. J. 2012; 102 (22768960): L34-L3610.1016/j.bpj.2012.03.011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we also observed that this activatory effect occurs extracellularly, i.e. when Rb+ is included in the pipette solution (Fig. 2C). This is in contrast to many other K2P channels (e.g. TREK-1), where Rb+ activation only works from the intracellular side (23Schewe M. Nematian-Ardestani E. Sun H. Musinszki M. Cordeiro S. Bucci G. de Groot B.L. Tucker S.J. Rapedius M. Baukrowitz T. A non-canonical voltage-sensing mechanism controls gating in K2P K+ channels.Cell. 2016; 164 (26919430): 937-94910.1016/j.cell.2016.02.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This provides further evidence that the TWIK-1 SF gating mechanism is different from most other members of the K2P channel family. TREK/TRAAK channel activity can also be regulated by intracellular H+, and so we examined whether intracellular pH also regulates TWIK-1* activity. Fig. 2, D and E, shows that the robust Rb+ currents recorded from TWIK-1* in excised patches are also sensitive to inhibition by intracellular H+ (pH0.5, ∼7.8). Thus, to optimize currents, all experiments were subsequently performed using an intracellular pH of 8.0. Furthermore, to distinguish TWIK-1* currents from leak, we quantified the effects of intracellular tetrapentylammonium (TPA) as a channel blocker (Fig. 2F). We found that intracellular TPA blocked TWIK-1* Rb+ currents with an even higher affinity (IC50 = 3.3 ± 0.1 μm) than typically observed for most other K2P channels (21Piechotta P.L. Rapedius M.

These results therefore established an experimental framework for the measurement of robust TWIK-1 channel activity. Several other monovalent cations have also been shown to activate the ion flux gating mechanism in other K2P channels, with Rb+ and NH4+ typically being the most potent and Na+ the least (23Schewe M. Nematian-Ardestani E. Sun H. Musinszki M. Cordeiro S. Bucci G. de Groot B.L. Tucker S.J. Rapedius M. Baukrowitz T.

Fig. 3, A–C, and Fig. S2 show a similar pattern of activation for WT TWIK-1*. But, in marked contrast to other K2Ps where Cs+ acts as a permeant blocker, Cs+ appears to activate the SF gate in TWIK-1* more effectively than K+. Furthermore, despite the levels of activation induced by intracellular NH4+ and Rb+, no tail currents could be observed upon repolarization (Fig. 3, A and D). This is in marked contrast to many other K2P channels where, under similar conditions, large tail currents can be observed upon repolarization (23Schewe M. Nematian-Ardestani E. Sun H. Musinszki M.

The activation of TWIK-1* by extracellular Rb+ (Fig. 2C) rules out the possibility that the channel cannot conduct extracellular ions into the cell, but to further examine the apparent absence of tail currents, we repeated these measurements at 3 °C to slow down channel gating kinetics. As a control for this effect, we used a mutant version of TREK-2 (26Dong Y.Y. Pike A.C. Mackenzie A. McClenaghan C. Aryal P. Dong L. Quigley A. Grieben M. Goubin S. Mukhopadhyay S. Ruda G.F.

However, for TWIK-1*, although the rate of channel activation also decreased at 3 °C, the inactivation kinetics of TWIK-1 were still unable to be resolved (Fig. 3D and Fig. S2). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that when the SF is occupied by K+, it may be extremely unstable, resulting in almost instantaneous inactivation when Rb+ is replaced by K+. To further investigate this, Rb+ was used as the permeant ion, and increasing concentrations of K+ were added. Intriguingly, we found that very low concentrations of K+ strongly inhibited these Rb+ currents (Fig. 4A). A full dose–response curve for this effect revealed an IC50 for K+ of 2.8 mm (Fig. 4A). In marked contrast, the TREK-1 K2P channel showed comparatively weaker K+-dependent inhibition of Rb+ currents (IC50 of ∼68 mm). To test whether this observed inhibitory effect of K+ on WT* TWIK-1 currents is specific, we compared the effect of several other monovalent cations. We found that K+ exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect and Cs+ the weakest (Fig. 4B). This also appears to be in agreement with the relative activatory effect of these different ions shown in Fig. 3A. We next set out to determine the mechanisms underlying this K+-dependent block of Rb+ permeation. In several previous studies, we have shown that most forms of gating in K2P channels occur primarily within the SF (21Piechotta P.L. Rapedius M. Stansfeld P.J. Bollepalli M.K. Ehrlich G. Erhlich G.

In nature, aldolases catalyze the reversible stereoselective aldol addition between two carbonyl compounds, making them attractive catalysts for the synthesis of various chemicals. In this work, we identified several 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolases (DERAs) having acetaldehyde condensation activity, which can be used for the biosynthesis of (R)-1,3-butanediol (1,3BDO) in combination with aldo-keto reductases (AKRs). Enzymatic screening of 20 purified DERAs revealed the presence of significant acetaldehyde condensation activity in 12 of the enzymes, with the highest activities in BH1352 from Bacillus halodurans, TM1559 from Thermotoga maritima, and DeoC from Escherichia coli.

Instead, the contribution of humoral response is still unclear, even if the presence of intrathecal antibodies and B-cells follicle-like structures in meninges of patients has been demonstrated. Several myelin and non-myelin antigens have been identified, but none has been validated as humoral biomarker. In particular autoantibodies against myelin proteins have been found also in healthy individuals, whereas non-myelin antigens have been implicated in neurodegenerative phase of the disease. To provide further putative autoantigens of multiple sclerosis, we investigated the antigen specificity of immunoglobulins present both in sera and in cerebrospinal fluid of patients using phage display technology in a new improved format. A human brain cDNA phage display library was constructed and enriched for open-read-frame fragments. This library was selected against pooled and purified immunoglobulins from cerebrospinal fluid and sera of multiple sclerosis patients. The antigen library was also screened against an antibody scFv library obtained from RNA of B cells purified from the cerebrospinal fluid of two relapsing remitting patients. From all biopanning a complex of 14 antigens were identified; in particular, one of these antigens, corresponding to DDX24 protein, was present in all selections. The ability of more frequently isolated antigens to discriminate between sera from patients with multiple sclerosis or other neurological diseases was investigated. The more promising novel candidate autoantigens were DDX24 and TCERG1. Both are implicated in RNA modification and regulation which can be altered in neurodegenerative processes. Therefore, we propose that they could be a marker of a particular disease activity state."
https://openalex.org/W2992702082,"ME/CFS is a chronic, complex, multisystem disease that often limits the health and functioning of the affected patients. Diagnosing patients with ME/CFS is a challenge, and many different case definitions exist and are used in clinical practice and research. Even after diagnosis, medical treatment is very challenging. Symptom relief and coping may affect how patients live with their disease and their quality of life. There is no consensus on which diagnostic criteria should be used and which treatment strategies can be recommended for patients. The purpose of the current project was to map the landscape of the Euromene countries in respect of national guidelines and recommendations for case definition, diagnosis and clinical approaches for ME/CFS patients. A 23 items questionnaire was sent out by email to the members of Euromene. The form contained questions on existing guidelines for case definitions, treatment/management of the disease, tests and questionnaires applied, and the prioritization of information for data sampling in research. We obtained information from 17 countries. Five countries reported having national guidelines for diagnosis, and five countries reported having guidelines for clinical approaches. For diagnostic purposes, the Fukuda criteria were most often recommended, and also the Canadian Consensus criteria, the International Consensus Criteria and the Oxford criteria were used. A mix of diagnostic criteria was applied within those countries having no guidelines. Many different questionnaires and tests were used for symptom registration and diagnostic investigation. For symptom relief, pain and anti-depressive medication were most often recommended. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Graded Exercise treatment were often recommended as disease management and rehabilitative/palliative strategies. The lack of consistency in recommendations across European countries urges the development of regulations, guidance and standards. The results of this study will contribute to the harmonization of diagnostic criteria and treatment for ME/CFS in Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2993559724,"Heat shock proteins of 70 kDa (Hsp70s) are ubiquitous and highly conserved molecular chaperones. They play multiple essential roles in assisting with protein folding and maintaining protein homeostasis. Their chaperone activity has been proposed to require several rounds of binding to and release of polypeptide substrates at the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of Hsp70s. All available structures have revealed a single substrate-binding site in the SBD that binds a single segment of an extended polypeptide of 3–4 residues. However, this well-established single peptide-binding site alone has made it difficult to explain the efficient chaperone activity of Hsp70s. In this study, using purified proteins and site-directed mutagenesis, along with fluorescence polarization and luciferase-refolding assays, we report the unexpected discovery of a second peptide-binding site in Hsp70s. More importantly, the biochemical analyses suggested that this novel binding site, named here P2, is essential for Hsp70 chaperone activity. Furthermore, cross-linking and mutagenesis studies indicated that this second binding site is in the SBD adjacent to the first binding site. Taken together, our results suggest that these two essential binding sites of Hsp70s cooperate in protein folding."

Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is an elicitor that has been demonstrated to have a vital influence on ginsenoside biosynthesis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) has been widely used in quantification of gene expressions. Here, we report the selection and validation of reference genes desirable for normalization of gene expressions quantified by qRT-PCR in ginseng hairy roots treated with MeJA. Twelve reference genes were selected as candidate genes, and their expressions were quantified by qRT-PCR, and analyzed by geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. CYP and EF-1α were shown to be the most stable reference genes in geNorm, CYP was the most stable reference gene in NormFinder, and 18S was the most stable reference gene in BestKeeper. On this basis, we further quantified the relative expression levels of four genes encoding key enzymes that are involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis using CYP and 18S as the reference genes, respectively. Moreover, correlation analysis was performed between the quantified expressions of four genes and the ginsenoside content in MeJA-treated ginseng hairy roots. The results of relative expressions of the four genes quantified using CYP as the reference gene and their significant correlations with the ginsenoside content were better than those using 18S as the reference gene. The CYP gene, hence, was concluded as the most desirable reference gene for quantification of the expressions of genes in MeJA-treated ginseng hairy roots. This finding, therefore, provides information useful for gene research in ginseng, particularly in MeJA-treated ginseng hairy roots, which includes identification and characterization of genes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis."

The relationship between parity and oral health is not as clear, although it is a widespread customary belief that pregnancy results in tooth loss. Parity has been associated with tooth loss in some populations, but not in others. It is important to understand the perceptions of women regarding the association between parity and tooth loss as these beliefs may influence health behaviors during the reproductive years. Aim To explore the views of Hausa women regarding the link between parity and tooth loss. Methods Qualitative data were collected through a grounded theory approach with focus group discussions (FGDs) of high and low parity Hausa women (n = 33) in northern Nigeria. Responses were elicited on the causes of tooth loss, effects of tooth loss on women’s quality of life, issues of parity and tooth loss, and cultural beliefs about parity and tooth loss. The data were analyzed thematically using ATLAS-ti. Results Respondents associated tooth loss with vomiting during labor, a condition termed ‘payar baka’. Poor oral hygiene, excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates, tooth worm, cancer and ageing were also believed to cause tooth loss. The greatest impacts of tooth loss on the lives of the respondents were esthetic and masticatory changes. Conclusion Respondents perceived that parity is indirectly linked to tooth loss, as reflected in their views on the association between vomiting during labor and tooth loss."
https://openalex.org/W2994103509,"Proteasome activity is required for diverse cellular processes, including transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. However, inhibiting proteasome activity can lead to an increase in transcriptional output that is correlated with enriched levels of trimethyl H3K4 and phosphorylated forms of RNA polymerase (Pol) II at the promoter and gene body. Here, we perform gene expression analysis and ChIP followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and we further explore genome-wide effects of proteasome inhibition on the chromatin state and RNA Pol II transcription. Analysis of gene expression programs and chromatin architecture reveals that chemically inhibiting proteasome activity creates a distinct chromatin state, defined by spreading of the H3K4me3 mark into the gene bodies of differentially-expressed genes. The distinct H3K4me3 chromatin profile and hyperacetylated nucleosomes at transcription start sites establish a chromatin landscape that facilitates recruitment of Ser-5- and Ser-2–phosphorylated RNA Pol II. Subsequent transcriptional events result in diverse gene expression changes. Alterations of H3K36me3 levels in the gene body reflect productive RNA Pol II elongation of transcripts of genes that are induced, underscoring the requirement for proteasome activity at multiple phases of the transcriptional cycle. Finally, by integrating genomics data and pathway analysis, we find that the differential effects of proteasome inhibition on the chromatin state modulate genes that are fundamental for cancer cell survival. Together, our results uncover underappreciated downstream effects of proteasome inhibitors that may underlie targeting of distinct chromatin states and key steps of RNA Pol II–mediated transcription in cancer cells."

However, rNTPs are equally abundant in both of these cell types and reach much higher concentrations than dNTPs. The greater difference in concentration between dNTPs and rNTPs in macrophages results in frequent misincorporation of noncanonical rNTPs during HIV-1 reverse transcription. Here, we tested whether the highly abundant SAM domain– and HD domain–containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) deoxynucleoside triphosphorylase in macrophages is responsible for frequent rNTP incorporation during HIV-1 reverse transcription. We also assessed whether Vpx (viral protein X), an accessory protein of HIV-2 and some simian immunodeficiency virus strains that targets SAMHD1 for proteolytic degradation, can counteract the rNTP incorporation. Results from biochemical simulation of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase–mediated DNA synthesis confirmed that rNTP incorporation is reduced under Vpx-mediated dNTP elevation. Using HIV-1 vector, we further demonstrated that dNTP pool elevation by Vpx or deoxynucleosides in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages reduces noncanonical rNTP incorporation during HIV-1 reverse transcription, an outcome similarly observed with the infectious HIV-1 89.6 strain. Furthermore, the simian immunodeficiency virus mac239 strain, encoding Vpx, displayed a much lower level of rNTP incorporation than its ΔVpx mutant in macrophages. Finally, the amount of rNMPs incorporated in HIV-1 proviral DNAs remained unchanged for ∼2 weeks in macrophages. These findings suggest that noncanonical rNTP incorporation is regulated by SAMHD1 in macrophages, whereas rNMPs incorporated in HIV-1 proviral DNA remain unrepaired.

As a result of the close proximity in chemical structures and large concentration discrepancy between rNTPs (millimolar range) and dNTPs (micromolar range), cellular DNA polymerases constantly misincorporate noncanonical rNTPs during synthesis of new DNA strands (14McElhinny S.A.N.

In fact, although rNTP incorporation during DNA synthesis is a highly common cellular DNA damage event (16Jinks-Robertson S. Klein H.L. Ribonucleotides in DNA: hidden in plain sight.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 (25736085): 176-17810.1038/nsmb.2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), most of living cells are capable of repairing the rNMPs incorporated in their dsDNAs. The key enzyme involved in the ribonucleotide repair is RNaseH2, which cleaves the 5′ end of a rNMP in dsDNA and initiates the excision repair mechanism known as ribonucleotide excision repair (RER) (18Sparks J.L. Chon H. Cerritelli S.M. Kunkel T.A. Johansson E. Crouch R.J. Burgers P.M. RNase H2-initiated ribonucleotide excision repair.Mol.

Interestingly, mutations in any one of the three RNaseH2 subunit genes (A, B, and C) induce the development of Aicardi–Goutieres syndrome, a rare genetic neuroimmune disorder also caused by SAMHD1 mutations (20Crow Y.J.

It has been postulated that defects in these nucleic acid metabolism enzymes may activate the interferon-mediated innate immune systems even in the absence of any infection (22Lebon P. Badoual J. Ponsot G. Goutières F. Hémeury-Cukier F. Aicardi J. Intrathecal synthesis of interferon-α in infants with progressive familial encephalopathy.J. Neurol.

We previously demonstrated that HIV-1 frequently incorporates noncanonical rNTPs during viral reverse transcription in macrophages, but not in activated CD4+ T cells (23Kennedy E.M. Amie S.M. Bambara R.A. Kim B. Frequent incorporation of ribonucleotides during HIV-1 reverse transcription and their attenuated repair in macrophages.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (22383524): 14280-1428810.1074/jbc.M112.348482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) because of a greater concentration discrepancy between rNTPs and dNTPs in macrophages compared with its actively dividing counterpart (24Kennedy E.M. Gavegnano C. Nguyen L. Slater R. Lucas A. Fromentin E. Schinazi R.F. Kim B. Ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrate of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase in human macrophages.J. Biol.

Basically, an abundant dNTP pool in activated CD4+ T cells minimizes rNTP incorporation by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) during virus replication (23Kennedy E.M. Amie S.M. Bambara R.A. Kim B. Frequent incorporation of ribonucleotides during HIV-1 reverse transcription and their attenuated repair in macrophages.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (22383524): 14280-1428810.1074/jbc.M112.348482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have also reported in the past that HIV-1 RT pauses near the rNMP incorporation sites during in vitro DNA synthesis (25Daddacha W. Noble E. Nguyen L.A. Kennedy E.M. Kim B. Effect of ribonucleotides embedded in a DNA template on HIV-1 reverse transcription kinetics and fidelity.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 (23479739): 12522-1253210.1074/jbc.M113.458398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested whether SAMHD1-mediated dNTP depletion is responsible for the frequent incorporation of the noncanonical rNTPs during HIV-1 reverse transcription in macrophages and whether viral protein (X), an accessory protein expressed by HIV-2 and some SIV strains, can reduce rNTP incorporation by the virus RT via its SAMHD1-counteracting activity. To investigate the effect of cellular dNTP levels on noncanonical rNTP incorporation during HIV-1 reverse transcription in nondividing macrophages, we employed two different treatments that elevate cellular dNTP levels in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) pooled from four healthy donors: 1) virus-like particles (VLPs) containing Vpx or 2) deoxynucleosides (dNs). First, we measured the dNTP levels in primary MDMs treated with Vpx (+) VLPs or dNs by using our RT-based dNTP assay (9Diamond T.L. Roshal M. Jamburuthugoda V.K. Reynolds H.M. Merriam A.R. Lee K.Y. Balakrishnan M. Bambara R.A. Planelles V. Dewhurst S. Kim B. Macrophage tropism of HIV-1 depends on efficient cellular dNTP utilization by reverse transcriptase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (15452123): 51545-5155310.1074/jbc.M408573200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 (A, Vpx, and B, dNs), the Vpx treatment was able to elevate dNTP levels in MDMs more effectively compared with that of the dN treatment. The less effective dNTP pool elevation observed in dN-treated MDMs can be explained by the presence of SAMHD1 in these cells, which would hydrolyze dNTPs newly synthesized from the added dNs, unlike the complete SAMHD1 degradation observed in the Vpx-treated macrophages (Fig. S1). Next, we investigated the effects of the Vpx- and dNs-mediated dNTP elevations on HIV-1 vector transduction efficiencies in MDMs. For this, we pretreated MDMs with VLP containing Vpx (Vpx +) for 12 h or dNs for 4 h prior to transduction with the D3HIV-1 GFP vector. Indeed, we observed that both Vpx (Fig. 1C) and dNs (Fig. 1D) treatments enhanced HIV-1 vector transduction efficiencies in primary MDMs represented as GFP-expressing cells when analyzed by FACS. However, HIV-1 vector transduction efficiencies were more effectively augmented by Vpx treatment than that of dNs, hence implying the effects of varying dNTP pool elevation on HIV-1 infections in MDMs. Next, to determine the nature of rNTP incorporation during HIV-1 reverse transcription at varying dNTP levels in MDMs, we have biochemically simulated rNTP incorporation by HIV-1 RT in the presence of dNTP concentrations found in MDMs treated with either VLPs with or without Vpx. The rNTPs incorporated in the enzymatically synthesized RT products were monitored by KOH treatment that specifically cleaves the 3′ end of any incorporated rNMP. As shown in Fig. 2A, when a 30-bp-long dsDNA encoding a single rNMP at the 14th nucleotide position from the 32P-labeled 5′ end of one strand of the dsDNA was treated with KOH, we observed the 14-mer cleavage product (see arrow) with little remaining full-length 30-bp DNA product (F in Fig. 2A). Conversely, there was no reduction of the 30-bp full-length product following KOH treatment of the dsDNA template without a single rNMP, hence confirming the specific rNMP cleavage in a dsDNA by the KOH treatments under our experimental conditions. In separate experimental setups, we extended a 5′ end 32P-labeled 18-mer primer (P) annealed to a 40-mer template (T) by purified HIV-1 RT protein under rNTP (24Kennedy E.M. Gavegnano C. Nguyen L. Slater R. Lucas A. Fromentin E. Schinazi R.F. Kim B. Ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrate of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase in human macrophages.J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 2B, the presence of rNTPs, which have been incorporated during HIV-1 RT-mediated DNA synthesis, was shown as reduction in the amount of full-length product generated following KOH treatment. We then compared the KOH-mediated reduction of full-length 40-bp DNA products generated by HIV-1 RT under the Vpx (−) or (+) condition. As shown in Fig. 2C, full-length DNA products generated under the dNTP/rNTP levels observed in the Vpx (+)–treated MDMs were less affected by the alkaline cleavage activity, whereas more than 40% of the RT product contained rNMPs, which were cleaved by KOH. We have also employed an additional T/P with shorter and different sequences to generate the 28-bp full-length product that was treated with KOH. As shown in Fig. 2D, similar with the findings obtained using the longer P/T, we observed a minimal KOH-mediated reduction of the 26-bp full-length product generated at the dNTP/rNTP concentrations found in the Vpx (+) treated MDMs. The dNTP and rNTP concentrations used in these biochemical simulations were shown in Fig. 2E. Overall, these biochemical simulation data suggest that misincorporation of noncanonical rNTPs during HIV-1 reverse transcription in macrophages can be minimized by the dNTP-elevating effects of Vpx. Kennedy et al. (23Kennedy E.M. Amie S.M. Bambara R.A. Kim B. Frequent incorporation of ribonucleotides during HIV-1 reverse transcription and their attenuated repair in macrophages.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (22383524): 14280-1428810.1074/jbc.M112.348482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) has previously reported that rNTPs were being frequently incorporated into the HIV-1 proviral DNA during reverse transcription within the low dNTP environment of primary human MDMs, whereas the incorporation of the noncanonical molecules was almost nonexistent within the high dNTP pool of activated CD4+ T cells. In our present study, we investigated the rNTP incorporation levels by HIV-1 when we induced dNTP pool elevation in MDMs either by Vpx or dNs. The levels of incorporated rNTPs within the HIV-1 proviral DNAs were measured by the reduction of HIV-1 2LTR circle DNA copy numbers following treatments with Jurkat cell nuclear extract, which contains RNaseH2 that specifically cleaves the 5′ end of incorporated rNMPs (23Kennedy E.M. Amie S.M. Bambara R.A. Kim B. Frequent incorporation of ribonucleotides during HIV-1 reverse transcription and their attenuated repair in macrophages.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (22383524): 14280-1428810.1074/jbc.M112.348482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). First, we tested and confirmed the RNasH2 cleavage activity of our Jurkat cell nuclear extract using a similar dsDNA template used in the earlier described KOH hydrolysis assay (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 3A, relatively similar RNaseH2 cleavage products were detected in reactions conducted with or without genomic DNA isolated from MDMs (200 ng), indicating that the RNaseH2 enzyme activity was not hindered by genomic DNA present under this condition. The specificity of RNaseH2 activity in the Jurkat cell nuclear extract toward a rNMP was confirmed because no cleavage product was evident in the same dsDNA template without a single rNMP (Fig. 3A). These data confirmed that the RNaseH2 activity of the Jurkat cell nuclear extract effectively recognizes and cleaves the rNMPs encoded in the target DNAs under our reaction conditions. Next, we treated MDMs with VLP Vpx (−) or (+) for 12 h before the cells were transduced with D3HIV-1 GFP vector. Following a 3-day incubation at 37 °C, the total cellular DNAs (200 ng) that also harbor HIV-1 2LTR circle DNAs were isolated from these MDMs and were treated with Jurkat cell nuclear extract or buffer. The 2LTR circle DNA copy numbers in the extracted nucleic acids were measured by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) as previously described (23Kennedy E.M. Amie S.M. Bambara R.A. Kim B. Frequent incorporation of ribonucleotides during HIV-1 reverse transcription and their attenuated repair in macrophages.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (22383524): 14280-1428810.1074/jbc.M112.348482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Buffer-treated DNA served as a control that determined the 2LTR circle DNA copy numbers prior to Jurkat cell nuclear extract treatments. As demonstrated in our earlier described biochemical simulation experiment (Fig. 2, C and D), rNMP cleavage by KOH within the target dsDNAs resulted in reduced amounts of full-length DNA products generated. Hence, the cleavage of rNMPs encoded in HIV-1 2LTR circle DNAs by the RNaseH2 enzyme found in Jurkat cell nuclear extract would reduce the amount of the target gene quantified by our qRT-PCR setup. As depicted in Fig. 3B, we observed 20.7% reduction in 2LTR DNA copy numbers following RNaseH2 treatments in samples isolated from MDMs pretreated with VLP Vpx (−), whereas only a minimal reduction (3.2%) was observed in MDMs pretreated with VLP Vpx (+). We also observed that RNaseH2 only minimally reduced 2LTR circle copy numbers in the total DNA samples extracted from MDMs pretreated with dNs (6.2%), compared with that of untreated MDMs (30.8%) (Fig. 3C). Next, we tested whether Vpx and dNs could also reduce the incorporation of the noncanonical rNTPs during reverse transcription of the infectious dual-tropic 89.6 strain in MDMs. Similarly, total cellular DNAs, which also made up HIV-1 env gene DNA, were extracted at the end of a 5-day incubation period at 37 °C. When the env gene DNA copy numbers were measured, we also observed fewer rNTPs being incorporated into HIV-1 proviral DNA during 89.6 infections in MDMs, which have been pretreated with either Vpx or dNs relative to the controls (Fig. 3D and 3E). Collectively, these findings suggest that the dNTP pool elevation in macrophages by Vpx or dNs restrict the incorporation of noncanonical rNTPs during viral replication. Similarly, minimal to no rNTP incorporation was observed in the HIV-1 env gene as quantified by qRT-PCR, within the high dNTP pool of activated CD4+ T cells infected with the infectious 89.6 strain (Fig. 3F). Because Vpx was capable of limiting rNTP incorporation into HIV-1 proviral DNA by modulating the cellular dNTP pool in MDMs, we then investigated the rNTP incorporation activity by SIVmac239 WT strain, which encodes Vpx compared with the ΔVpx SIVmac239 mutant. We predicted that because Vpx expressed by SIVmac239 WT is capable of degrading cellular SAMHD1 (Fig. S1), the resulting hike in dNTP levels would render the virus RT to incorporate rNTPs less frequently as opposed to the Vpx-deficient mutant. To test this prediction, we employed the RNaseH2/Jurkat cell nuclear extract-based qRT-PCR assay for determining the copy numbers of the SIVmac239 gag gene. MDMs were infected with SIVmac239 or its ΔVpx mutant for 5 days before total DNAs from the infected cells were harvested for subsequent quantification. As shown in Fig. 4A, the total DNA samples extracted from MDMs infected with SIVmac239 displayed only minimal reduction of the gag gene copy number following treatment with Jurkat cell nuclear extract. However, we observed a significant reduction of the gag gene copy number in the samples extracted from MDMs infected with the ΔVpx SIVmac239 mutant (Fig. 4B). This observation further supports that Vpx is capable of restricting rNTP incorporation during viral replication by modulating cellular dNTP pool in infected macrophages. In addition, the observed discrepancy in rNTP incorporation between SIVmac239 (Fig. 4) and HIV-1 (Fig. 3) in macrophages results from their different ability to counteract host SAMHD1 dNTPase and to elevate cellular dNTP levels in macrophages. Because incorporated rNTPs are detrimental toward regular DNA replication, removal of the embedded ribonucleotides are initiated by the RNaseH2 enzyme via a DNA damage repair mechanism known as the RER pathway (18Sparks J.L.

The level of RNaseH2 protein and its enzymatic activity were relatively lower in MDMs as compared with replicating cell lines such as the activated CD4+ T cells, as published previously (23Kennedy E.M.

Hence, we investigated the long-term fates of incorporated rNMPs incorporated in HIV-1 proviral DNAs within infected MDMs. First, MDMs were transduced with D3-HIV1 GFP vector, and total cellular DNAs were extracted from the infected cells at different time points of infection (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 days postinfection).

Many say it9s the right thing to do. But retiring research monkeys can be onerous and expensive. At the same time, some in the biomedical community say sending monkeys to sanctuaries is a bad idea, because it can deprive scientists of critical data. All of this has left labs caught in the middle, struggling with whether they should retire their monkeys—and the best way to do it."
https://openalex.org/W2991773150,"Enhancement of oral absorption of food allergens by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), especially aspirin, is considered an exacerbating factor in the development of food allergies. In this study, we examined the effect of aspirin on oral sensitization to and absorption of the egg-white allergen ovalbumin (OVA) in rats. The absorption of OVA was evaluated by measuring the plasma concentration of OVA after oral administration by gavage. To evaluate oral sensitization to OVA, plasma levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) E and IgG1 antibodies (Abs) specific to OVA were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after initiation of sensitization. High-dose aspirin (30 mg/kg) increased oral OVA absorption and plasma levels of OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 Abs compared with those observed in vehicle-treated rats. In contrast, low-dose aspirin (3 mg/kg) exerted no changes in either absorption or sensitization. Spermine, an absorption enhancer, increased the oral absorption of OVA to nearly the same extent as high-dose aspirin, whereas the plasma levels of OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 Abs exhibited no significant differences between spermine- and vehicle-treated rats. Among the NSAIDs, diclofenac and indomethacin increased sensitization to OVA, similar to high-dose aspirin, but meloxicam exerted no effects on Ab levels. In conclusion, we showed that high-dose aspirin enhanced oral sensitization to OVA. Our study suggests that enhanced oral sensitization to OVA cannot be ascribed to increased absorption of OVA from the intestinal tract. Although the mechanisms underlying this enhancement of sensitization are still controversial, our study suggests that modification of cytokine production due to impairment of the intestinal barrier function and inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 activity by aspirin may be involved."
