https://openalex.org/W2003463034,In the cerebral cortex of the opossum and the wallaby there Is a complete and coincident overlap of the sensory and the motor representations of the body. Within this sensorimotor area It is not possible to draw the line which in other mammals separates a primarily sensory area from a primarily motor area.

This call stimulated nearby animals to push the head of the distressed animal to the surface to breathe. After the animal breathed, a vocal exchange preceded other forms of aid."

https://openalex.org/W1587892090,"SUMMARY The aggregation with decreasing pH is in contrast with the dissociation of bovine prothrombin, which is reported to give sub- units of 34,000 in phthalate buffers of pH 4.92 to 6.0 (3, 4). It may not be surprising, however, to find aggregation as the pH approaches the solubility minimum (approximately 4.2 to 4.6). In view of the fact that certain other blood coagulation factors (9, 10, 16), prothrombin derivatives (14, 15), or both may affect the activation of the zymogen, and hence the results of the two- stage assay for prothrombin activity, it was considered possible that the results might be explained by a separation of a prothrom- bin accelerator or accelerators during the partition cell experi- ments or the sucrose gradient studies. Such has been shown to by the case when prothrombin preparations are analyzed by starch block electrophoresis (12). However, assays for three of these factors,3 Factors VII, IX, and X, by methods summarized elsewhere (39, 40) gave activities of less than 3% of the total activities of the prothrombin preparations examined. Factors V, VIII, and XI were undetectable. When assayed in the parti- tion cell experiments, the activity of these factors were found to have sedimentation rates that were not significantly different from that of prothrombin. In addition, mixing experiments were performed with material obtained from the top and bottom of the Prothrombin was isolated in 30 to 40% yield from human acid-citrate-dextrose plasma by a modification of the Lewis and Ware procedure further purified by adsorption on diethylaminoethyl cellulose and Sephadex gel filtration. Prod- ucts obtained were of high specific activity, were electro- phoretically homogeneous from pH 7.0 to 9.0, and were devoid of estraneous plasma proteins by immunoelectrophoresis. Sedi- mentation velocity analyses of these preparations were carried out the partition cell, which permitted calculation of sedimentation coefficients from the schlieren pattern as well from the prothrombin activity (two-stage) and protein isolated from cell at end of each run. The results obtained demonstrated that the zymogen polymerizes at low pH and ionic strength and that the prothrombin activity sediments at a higher rate than the majority of protein. This latter finding was confirmed by sedimentation in a stabilizing sucrose gradient in the bucket rotor of the ultracentrifuge. In addition, sedimen- tation coefficients for prothrombin activity in native plasma have demonstrated similar results, which, however, include a dependence of sedimentation rate on the anticoagulant used. These findings indicate a possible pH-dependent polymerization of human prothrombin and suggest that the specific activity the zymogen may be greater than previously suspected. REFERENCES 1."

This spacing appears to correspond to a common substructural feature within the ribosomes. The intensity distribution is consistent with a model in which part of the RNA is in the form of four or five parallel double helices 45 to 50 A apart."

Termination of an intense light was the reinforcement in an escape conditioning situation. The rate of response for the experimental subjects was significantly different from that of controls matched for equivalent changes in light intensity.

The maturational pattern of the acid consists of high resting levels early in development, a marked decrease during a period between 8 and 12 days, and a subsequent return to high levels. The onset of the maturational pattern is accelerated by previous manipulation of the newborn rat."

In the course of this work two strains of another arthropod-borne virus were obtained. Designated Trojica Nos. 1 and 2 after the village where they occurred, these strains have now been identified as belonging to the California complex2 of arthropod-borne viruses."

The illusion also holds, though attenuated, when lines are perceived tactually, even in blind subjects1. This communication is concerned with a similar error which is made when speed of movement is assessed tactually, but which does not show when the judgment is made visually."
