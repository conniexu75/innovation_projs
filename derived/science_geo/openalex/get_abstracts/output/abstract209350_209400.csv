https://openalex.org/W2008014219,"We can now have considerable confidence that the broad features of protein synthesis are understood. The involvement of RNA is very much more complicated than was imagined in 1953. There is not one functional RNA. Instead, protein synthesis demands the ordered interaction of three classes of RNA—ribosomal, soluble, and messenger. Many important questions, however, remain unanswered. For instance, there is no theoretical framework for the ribosomal subunits, nor for that matter, do we understand the functional significance of ribosomal RNA. Most satisfying is the realization that all the steps in protein replication will be shown to involve well-understood chemical forces. As yet we do not know all the details. For example, are the DNA base pairs involved in messenger RNA selection of the corresponding amino-acyl-sRNA? With luck, this will soon be known. We can thus have every expectation that future progress in understanding selective protein synthesis (and its consequences for embryology) will have a similarly well-defined and, when understood, easy-to-comprehend chemical basis."

https://openalex.org/W1213915929,"In the accompanying paper (2) it was shown that Neisseria meningitidis, strain 1908 (Group C), forms N-acetylneuraminic acid by the condensation of N-acetyl-n-mannosamine and phosphoenolpyruvate with elimination of the phosphate group. In a preliminary communication we have reported a neK type of reaction carried out by another enzyme of Ncisserio meningitidis, strain 1998, which might be considered the activation of N-acetylneuraminic acid (1). In this irreversible reaction, cytidine triphosphate condenses with N-acetylneuraminic acid to form cytidine 5’-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Diagram 1)’ and inorganic pyrophoaphate (Equation 1)."

https://openalex.org/W1967106431,"Previous studies have demonstrated that in addition to its effects on metabolic rate, thyroxine stimulates protein biosynthesis. The administration of puromycin, a drug which blocks protein synthesis and, therefore, the thyroxine effect on protein synthesis, acutely reverses the hypermetabolism induced in rats by prior administration of thyroxine and restores the oxygen consumption of the thyrotoxic rats to the euthyroid level. The results suggest that a larger fraction of the total body basal oxygen consumption in hyperthyroidism is related to the process of protein synthesis than in the euthyroid state and that the calorigenic effect of thyroxine is secondary to its effect on protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2117654157,"It has been shown by Gary and Bard (1) that the catabolic pathway of glucose in Bacillus subtilis changes with the cultural conditions, particularly the type of nitrogen source employed for the incubation. These authors reported that cells grown on tryptone-yeast extract-glucose medium (C-cells) rely heavily on the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway for glucose dissimilation, whereas cells grown on ammonium-salts-glucose medium (S-cells) utilize glucose predominantly via the hexose monophosphate pathway. The variation in catabolism has been explained by Gary, Klausmeier, and Bard (2) as due to the reduced levels of glyceraldehyde phosphate and lactate dehydrogenase present in S-cells and the absence of cytochrome oxidase in C-cells. The relative participation of catabolic pathways with respect to glucose utilization by B. subtilis cells grown on ammoniumsalts-glucose-yeast extract medium has subsequently been examined by Wang et al. (3). The results showed that under the described cultural conditions, glucose is catabolized mainly (65%) by way of the glycolytic pathway and to a limited extent (35%) via the hexose monophosphate pathway. Yet to be understood are several facets of the over-all catabolic mechanism. They are: (a) a quantitative evaluation of the variation in pathway participation as caused by changes in cultural conditions; (b) the fate of substrate glucose traversing the hexose monophosphate pathway, particularly with respect to the catabolic fate of fructose 6phosphate derived from substrate glucose. Better understanding of these facets is of great importance in evaluating the function of individual catabolic sequences with respect to respiration and synthesis and in elucidating the role played by the pentose cycle pathway in microbial catabolism. In this work, glucose and gluconate specifically labeled with Cl4 have been used as substrates for proliferating B. subtilis cells in a series of radiorespirometric studies. The findings provide much information with regard to the nature and function of the hexose monophosphate pathway in this organism. On the basis of an understanding reached in this study, the equations devised previously (3) for the estimation of glucose pathways in microorganisms have been modified."

https://openalex.org/W2044026918,"ASBESTOSIS has been produced in monkeys, rabbits and guinea pigs exposed to crocidolite, amosite and chrysotile asbestos dusts in experimental dust rooms1. No record of asbestosis occurring in non-experimental animals has been found, although Kiviluoto found anthophyllite asbestos fibres in the lungs of a cow from the vicinity of an asbestos mine2. He suggested that this finding supported his contention that the mining process was not directly responsible for the inhalation of asbestos dust in those cases of bilateral pleural calcification in which there was no history of an industrial exposure to asbestos dust."

https://openalex.org/W2025421264,"Reticulocyte ribosomes with sedimentation coefficients greater than 100S (""heavy"" ribosomes) appear to be considerably more active in hemoglobin synthesis than are 78S ribosomes. When assayed for the ability to synthesize polyphenylalanine in the presence of polyuridylic acid, the 78S ribosomes and ""heavy"" ribosomes have similar activities. Polyuridylic acid inhibits incorporation by ""heavy"" ribosomes of amino acids other than phenylalanine."

The data support Schneirla's views correlating stimulus magnitudes and approach-withdrawal. The positive reinforcing value of this bitter substance as a weak stimulus is diminished with continuous exposure and no secondary reinforcement. Avoidance is related to intensity of stimulation rather than modality or postingestion effects."

https://openalex.org/W2050951010,Equilibrium was achieved in centrifugal fields with tobacco mosaic virus by the Beams magnetically suspended ultracentrifuge. An attempt was made to account for the earth's gravitational component by using tilted cells in the rotor. The determinations of particle weight on highly uniform rods of tobacco mosaic virus in the apparent absence of nonideal behavior gave a value of (41.6 +/- 0.1) 10(6).
https://openalex.org/W2058055825,1-α-Tocopheryl acetate has 42 percent of the activity of d-α- tocopheryl acetate when compared in the rat hemolysis test. Based on this activity a potency ratio of 1.4 : 1.0 for d-α-tocopheryl acetate compared to dl-α- tocopheryl acetate was established; this confirms the currently accepted biological ratio. Preparations of dl-α-tocopheryl acetate from phytol and from isophytol were equally active in the rat hemolysis test.

The animals showed apparently insatiable responding, at rates that were extremely high as compared with rates for normally reared control animals."

In muscles exposed during the second of three periods to 25 percent oxygen, the volume of oxygen consumed (QO2) was depressed by 50 percent, but returned to the control level during a third period at 98 percent oxygen. The work capacity was not significantly altered if the partial pressure of oxygen was low."

https://openalex.org/W2078180117,"IN the course of an investigation into the cause of death in intestinal obstruction in dogs, we have examined material obtained from dogs with isolated loops prepared by the technique of Harper and Blain1. Such material is known to be toxic when injected intravenously in small quantities into healthy dogs2–4. In attempting to define the nature of the toxic substance, we have examined its effect on isolated smooth muscle. Peritoneal fluid and loop contents from some dogs caused slow contractions of smooth muscle which were not abolished by atropine, mepyramine or lysergic acid diethylamide. Material was diluted 10–100 times and was applied directly to a guinea pig ileum preparation at 35° C. Contractions were slow in onset and reached a maximum in about 1 min. On changing the fluid in the tissue bath the muscle relaxed within 1–2 min. Similar, but less potent, activity was also shown by intestinal contents of normal dogs."
