https://openalex.org/W2036743290,"The Mycobiome In the past few years, much attention has been given to the trillions of bacterial inhabitants in our guts and the myriad of ways in which they influence our overall health. But what about fungi? Iliev et al. (p. 1314 ) now report that mice and humans, along with several other mammals, contain a resident intestinal population of fungi. Deletion of Dectin-1, which acts as a major innate immune sensor for fungi, led to enhanced susceptibility and worse pathology in a chemically induced model of colitis in mice. A polymorphism in the gene that encodes Dectin-1 has been observed in patients with ulcerative colitis, which hints that, besides the traditional bacterial microbiome, alterations in the “mycobiome” may also play a role in health and disease."

Several diseases and infections, however, lead to a breach in this barrier, which leads to chronic inflammation and pathology. Sonnenberg et al. (p. 1321 ) found that in mice, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are critically important for the anatomical containment of commensal bacteria in an interleukin-22 (IL-22)–dependent manner. ILC depletion or blockade of IL-22 led to loss of bacterial containment and systemic inflammation."

It is also allowing us to envision exciting new ways for addressing global health problems. This area is inherently interdisciplinary, offering a wealth of opportunities to create new fields, partnerships, and educational initiatives. It is captivating to the public and carries substantial expectations. As such, participating scientists need to sponsor proactive, solution-focused discussions of its societal implications."
https://openalex.org/W2070143210,"Follicular atresia is common in female mammalian ovaries, where most follicles undergo degeneration at any stage of growth and development. Oxidative stress gives rise to triggering granulosa cell apoptosis, which has been suggested as a major cause of follicular atresia. However, the underlying mechanism by which the oxidative stress induces follicular atresia remains unclear. FoxO transcription factors are known as critical mediators in the regulation of oxidative stress and apoptosis. In this study, the involvement of FoxO1 in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of mouse follicular granulosa cells (MGCs) was investigated in vivo and in vitro. It was observed that increased apoptotic signals correlated with elevated expression of FoxO1 in MGCs when mice were treated with the oxidant. Correspondingly, the expressions of FoxO1 target genes, such as proapoptotic genes and antioxidative genes, were also up-regulated. In primary cultured MGCs, treatment with H(2)O(2) led to FoxO1 nuclear translocation. Further studies with overexpression and knockdown of FoxO1 demonstrated the critical role of FoxO1 in the induction of MGC apoptosis by oxidative stress. Finally, inactivation of FoxO1 by insulin treatment confirmed that FoxO1 induced by oxidative stress played a pivotal role in up-regulating the expression of downstream apoptosis-related genes in MGCs. Our results suggest that up-regulation of FoxO1 by oxidative stress leads to apoptosis of granulosa cells, which eventually results in follicular atresia in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2094081498,"Campylobacter concisus, a bacterium colonizing the human oral cavity, has been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study investigated if patients with IBD are colonized with specific oral C. concisus strains that have potential to cause enteric diseases.Seventy oral and enteric C. concisus isolates obtained from eight patients with IBD and six controls were examined for housekeeping genes by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), Caco2 cell invasion by gentamicin-protection-assay, protein analysis by mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE, and morphology by scanning electron microscopy. The whole genome sequenced C. concisus strain 13826 which was isolated from an individual with bloody diarrhea was included in MLST analysis.MLST analysis showed that 87.5% of individuals whose C. concisus belonged to Cluster I had inflammatory enteric diseases (six IBD and one with bloody diarrhea), which was significantly higher than that in the remaining individuals (28.6%) (P<0.05). Enteric invasive C. concisus (EICC) oral strain was detected in 50% of patients with IBD and none of the controls. All EICC strains were in Cluster 1. The C. concisus strain colonizing intestinal tissues of patient No. 1 was closely related to the oral C. concisus strain from patient No. 6 and had gene recombination with the patient's own oral C. concisus. The oral and intestinal C. concisus strains of patient No. 3 were the same strain. Some individuals were colonized with multiple oral C. concisus strains that have undergone natural recombination.This study provides the first evidence that patients with IBD are colonized with specific oral C. concisus strains, with some being EICC strains. C. concisus colonizing intestinal tissues of patients with IBD at least in some instances results from an endogenous colonization of the patient's oral C. concisus and that C. concisus strains undergo natural recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2070861918,"The mammalian circadian clock coordinates various physiological activities with environmental cues to achieve optimal adaptation. The clock manifests oscillations of key clock proteins, which are under dynamic control at multiple post-translational levels. As a major post-translational regulator, the ubiquitination-dependent proteasome degradation system is counterbalanced by a large group of deubiquitin proteases with distinct substrate preference. Until now, whether deubiquitination by ubiquitin-specific proteases can regulate the clock protein stability and circadian pathways remains largely unclear. The mammalian clock protein, cryptochrome 1 (CRY1), is degraded via the FBXL3-mediated ubiquitination pathway, suggesting that it is also likely to be targeted by the deubiquitination pathway. Here, we identified that USP2a, a circadian-controlled deubiquitinating enzyme, interacts with CRY1 and enhances its protein stability via deubiquitination upon serum shock. Depletion of Usp2a by shRNA greatly enhances the ubiquitination of CRY1 and dampens the oscillation amplitude of the CRY1 protein during a circadian cycle. By stabilizing the CRY1 protein, USP2a represses the Per2 promoter activity as well as the endogenous Per2 gene expression. We also demonstrated that USP2a-dependent deubiquitination and stabilization of the CRY1 protein occur in the mouse liver. Interestingly, the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, increases the CRY1 protein level and inhibits circadian gene expression in a USP2a-dependent fashion. Therefore, USP2a potentially mediates circadian disruption by suppressing the CRY1 degradation during inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2113254135,"The resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux systems are ubiquitous transporters that function in antimicrobial resistance. Recent studies showed that RND systems were required for virulence factor production in Vibrio cholerae. The V. cholerae genome encodes six RND efflux systems. Three of the RND systems (VexB, VexD, and VexK) were previously shown to be redundant for in vitro resistance to bile acids and detergents. A mutant lacking the VexB, VexD, and VexK RND pumps produced wild-type levels of cholera toxin (CT) and the toxin co-regulated pilus (TCP) and was moderately attenuated for intestinal colonization. In contrast, a RND negative mutant produced significantly reduced amounts of CT and TCP and displayed a severe colonization defect. This suggested that one or more of the three uncharacterized RND efflux systems (i.e. VexF, VexH, and VexM) were required for pathogenesis. In this study, a genetic approach was used to generate a panel of V. cholerae RND efflux pump mutants in order to determine the function of VexH in antimicrobial resistance, virulence factor production, and intestinal colonization. VexH contributed to in vitro antimicrobial resistance and exhibited a broad substrate specificity that was redundant with the VexB, VexD, and VexK RND efflux pumps. These four efflux pumps were responsible for in vitro antimicrobial resistance and were required for virulence factor production and intestinal colonization. Mutation of the VexF and/or VexM efflux pumps did not affect in vitro antimicrobial resistance, but did negatively affect CT and TCP production. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the V. cholerae RND efflux pumps have redundant functions in antimicrobial resistance and virulence factor production. This suggests that the RND efflux systems contribute to V. cholerae pathogenesis by providing the bacterium with protection against antimicrobial compounds that are present in the host and by contributing to the regulated expression of virulence factors."
https://openalex.org/W2081874177,"Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy is frequently used to study protein interactions and conformational changes in living cells. The utility of FRET is limited by false positive and negative signals. To overcome these limitations we have developed Fluorescence Polarization and Fluctuation Analysis (FPFA), a hybrid single-molecule based method combining time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy (homo-FRET) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Using FPFA, homo-FRET (a 1-10 nm proximity gauge), brightness (a measure of the number of fluorescent subunits in a complex), and correlation time (an attribute sensitive to the mass and shape of a protein complex) can be simultaneously measured. These measurements together rigorously constrain the interpretation of FRET signals. Venus based control-constructs were used to validate FPFA. The utility of FPFA was demonstrated by measuring in living cells the number of subunits in the α-isoform of Venus-tagged calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase-II (CaMKIIα) holoenzyme. Brightness analysis revealed that the holoenzyme has, on average, 11.9 ± 1.2 subunit, but values ranged from 10-14 in individual cells. Homo-FRET analysis simultaneously detected that catalytic domains were arranged as dimers in the dodecameric holoenzyme, and this paired organization was confirmed by quantitative hetero-FRET analysis. In freshly prepared cell homogenates FPFA detected only 10.2 ± 1.3 subunits in the holoenzyme with values ranging from 9-12. Despite the reduction in subunit number, catalytic domains were still arranged as pairs in homogenates. Thus, FPFA suggests that while the absolute number of subunits in an auto-inhibited holoenzyme might vary from cell to cell, the organization of catalytic domains into pairs is preserved."
https://openalex.org/W2072575850,"Tumor microenvironement is an important actor of ovarian cancer progression but the relations between mesenchymal cells and ovarian cancer cells remain unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the ovarian cancer cells' biological modifications induced by mesenchymal cells. To address this issue, we used two different ovarian cancer cell lines (NIH:OVCAR3 and SKOV3) and co-cultured them with mesenchymal cells. Upon co-culture the different cell populations were sorted to study their transcriptome and biological properties. Transcriptomic analysis revealed three biological-function gene clusters were enriched upon contact with mesenchymal cells. These were related to the increase of metastatic abilities (adhesion, migration and invasion), proliferation and chemoresistance in vitro. Therefore, contact with the mesenchymal cell niche could increase metastatic initiation and expansion through modification of cancer cells. Taken together these findings suggest that pathways involved in hetero-cellular interaction may be targeted to disrupt the acquired pro-metastatic profile."
https://openalex.org/W2074120362,"Intrinsically disordered (ID) sequence segments are abundant in cell signaling proteins and transcription factors. Because ID regions commonly fold as part of their intracellular function, it is crucial to understand the folded states as well as the transitions between the unfolded and folded states. Specifically, it is important to determine 1) whether large ID segments contain different thermodynamically and/or functionally distinct regions, 2) whether any ID regions fold upon activation, 3) the degree of coupling between the different ID regions, and 4) whether the stability of ID domains is a determinant of function. In this study, we thermodynamically characterized the full-length ID N-terminal domain (NTD) of human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and two of its naturally occurring translational isoforms. The protective osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) was used to induce folding transitions. Each of the three NTD isoforms was found to undergo a cooperative folding transition that is thermodynamically indistinguishable (based on m-values) from that of a globular protein of similar size. The extrapolated stabilities for the NTD isoforms showed clear correlation with the known activities of their corresponding GR translational isoforms. The data reveal that the full-length NTD can be viewed as having at least two thermodynamically coupled regions, a functional region, which is indispensable for GR transcriptional activity, and a regulatory region, the length of which serves to regulate the stability of NTD and thus the activity of GR. These results suggest a new functional paradigm whereby steroid hormone receptors in particular and ID proteins in general can have multiple functionally distinct ID regions that interact and modulate the stability of important functional sites.

https://openalex.org/W1967404571,"Interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1(IRAK1), a key molecule in TLR/IL-1R-mediated signaling, is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded upon ligand stimulation. We and others have recently identified Pellino proteins as novel RING E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in IRAK1 polyubiquitination and degradation. However, it remains unclear how each Pellino member distinctly regulates TLR/IL-1R signaling by modulating IRAK1 ubiquitination. In this study we examined the role of Pellino 2 in IL-1- and LPS-mediated signaling and gene expression by knocking down Pellino 2 in human 293-IL-1R cells and primary bone marrow macrophages. Pellino 2 (but not Pellino 1) knockdown abolished IL-1- and LPS-induced Lys-63-linked IRAK1 ubiquitination with reduced Lys-48-linked IRAK1 ubiquitination. Furthermore, Pellino 2 is required for TAK1-dependent NFκB activation. However, because of the retained TAK1-independent NFκB activation, the levels of IL-1- and LPS-induced NFκB activation were not substantially affected in Pellino 2 knockdown 293-IL-1R cells and primary macrophages, respectively. On the other hand, Pellino 2 knockdown reduced the IL-1- and LPS-induced inflammatory gene expression at late time points, which was accompanied by increased decay rates of the mRNAs of the inflammatory genes. Importantly, IL-1- and LPS-mediated JNK and ERK activation were substantially attenuated in Pellino 2 knock-down cells, implicating MAPK activation in TLR/IL-1R-induced mRNA stabilization. Taken together, this study demonstrated that Pellino 2 plays a critical role for TLR/IL-1R-mediated post-transcriptional control."
https://openalex.org/W1972629512,"Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is commonly used to treat sports-related tendinopathy or tendon injury. Tendon healing requires tenocyte migration to the repair site, followed by proliferation and synthesis of the extracellular matrix. This study was designed to determine the effect of laser on tenocyte migration. Furthermore, the correlation between this effect and expression of dynamin 2, a positive regulator of cell motility, was also investigated. Tenocytes intrinsic to rat Achilles tendon were treated with low-level laser (660 nm with energy density at 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 J/cm2). Tenocyte migration was evaluated by an in vitro wound healing model and by transwell filter migration assay. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expressions of dynamin 2 were determined by reverse transcription/real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) and Western blot analysis respectively. Immunofluorescence staining was used to evaluate the dynamin 2 expression in tenocytes. Tenocytes with or without laser irradiation was treated with dynasore, a dynamin competitor and then underwent transwell filter migration assay. In vitro wound model revealed that more tenocytes with laser irradiation migrated across the wound border to the cell-free zone. Transwell filter migration assay confirmed that tenocyte migration was enhanced dose-dependently by laser. Real-time PCR and Western-blot analysis demonstrated that mRNA and protein expressions of dynamin 2 were up-regulated by laser irradiation dose-dependently. Confocal microscopy showed that laser enhanced the expression of dynamin 2 in cytoplasm of tenocytes. The stimulation effect of laser on tenocytes migration was suppressed by dynasore. In conclusion, low-level laser irradiation stimulates tenocyte migration in a process that is mediated by up-regulation of dynamin 2, which can be suppressed by dynasore."

Recently, we discovered that opticin possesses anti-angiogenic activity using a murine oxygen-induced retinopathy model: here, we investigate the underlying mechanism. Using an ex vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, we show that opticin inhibits angiogenesis when stimulated by a range of growth factors. We show that it suppresses capillary morphogenesis, inhibits endothelial invasion, and promotes capillary network regression in three-dimensional matrices of collagen and Matrigel(TM). We then show that opticin binds to collagen and thereby competitively inhibits endothelial cell interactions with collagen via α(1)β(1) and α(2)β(1) integrins, thereby preventing the strong adhesion that is required for proangiogenic signaling via these integrins."
https://openalex.org/W2069689165,"The functional diversity of cytoplasmic dynein is in part attributed to multiple interactions between noncatalytic dynein subunits and an array of regulatory proteins. This study focuses on the interaction between the dynein intermediate chain subunit (IC) and a dynein regulator protein (NudE). We use isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy to map their interacting sections to their respective N-terminal domains, which are predicted to form dimeric coiled-coils. Interestingly, the specific residues within IC that interact with NudE are a subset of the bi-segmental binding region reported for p150(Glued), a subunit of the dynein activator protein dynactin. Although the IC binding domains of both NudE and p150(Glued) form dimeric coiled-coils and bind IC at a common site, we observe distinct binding modes for each regulatory protein: 1) NudE binds region 1 of the bi-segmental binding footprint of p150(Glued), whereas p150(Glued) requires regions 1 and 2 to match the binding affinity of NudE with region 1 alone. 2) Compared with unbound IC, NudE-bound IC shows a slight increase in flexibility in region 2, in contrast to the increase in ordered structure observed for p150(Glued)-bound IC (Morgan, J. L., Song, Y., and Barbar, E. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 39349-39359). 3) Although NudE has a higher affinity for the common binding segment on IC, when all three proteins are in solution, IC preferentially binds p150(Glued). These results underscore the importance of a bi-segmental binding region of IC and disorder in region 2 and flanking linkers in selecting which regulatory protein binds IC."
https://openalex.org/W2088278216,"DNA barcoding remains a challenge when applied to diet analyses, ancient DNA studies, environmental DNA samples and, more generally, in any cases where DNA samples have not been adequately preserved. Because the size of the commonly used barcoding marker (COI) is over 600 base pairs (bp), amplification fails when the DNA molecule is degraded into smaller fragments. However, relevant information for specimen identification may not be evenly distributed along the barcoding region, and a shorter target can be sufficient for identification purposes. This study proposes a new, widely applicable, method to compare the performance of all potential ‘mini-barcodes’ for a given molecular marker and to objectively select the shortest and most informative one. Our method is based on a sliding window analysis implemented in the new R package SPIDER (Species IDentity and Evolution in R). This method is applicable to any taxon and any molecular marker. Here, it was tested on earthworm DNA that had been degraded through digestion by carnivorous landsnails. A 100 bp region of 16 S rDNA was selected as the shortest informative fragment (mini-barcode) required for accurate specimen identification. Corresponding primers were designed and used to amplify degraded earthworm (prey) DNA from 46 landsnail (predator) faeces using 454-pyrosequencing. This led to the detection of 18 earthworm species in the diet of the snail. We encourage molecular ecologists to use this method to objectively select the most informative region of the gene they aim to amplify from degraded DNA. The method and tools provided here, can be particularly useful (1) when dealing with degraded DNA for which only small fragments can be amplified, (2) for cases where no consensus has yet been reached on the appropriate barcode gene, or (3) to allow direct analysis of short reads derived from massively parallel sequencing without the need for bioinformatic consolidation."

BRCA2 was either not analyzed or showed much lower mutation frequencies. Therefore, we screened a group of TNBC patients (n = 30) of white European descent for mutations in BRCA2 as well as in BRCA1. Cases were unselected for age of disease-onset (median age at breast cancer diagnosis was 58 years, ranging from 37 to 74 years), family history of cancer and BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status. Half of the patients (15/30) showed a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. A high frequency of deleterious germline mutations was observed in BRCA2 (5/30; 16.7%), and only one case showed a BRCA1 mutation (3.3%). Although the study group was small, these results point to BRCA2 mutations being important in TNBC."

PAK1 is an effector of Rho GTPases and is activated by the binding of active Rac1 and Cdc42 (18.Bokoch G.M. Biology of the p21-activated kinases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The binding of Rho GTPases stimulates phosphorylation of PAK1 at Thr-423, the same site also stimulated by the onset of GSIS (7.Wang Z. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. Glucose-stimulated Cdc42 signaling is essential for the second phase of insulin secretion.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9536-9546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Additionally, PAK1 is required for the activation of Rho GTPases through phosphorylation of GDIα. Phosphorylation of GDIα at Ser-174 by PAK1 dissociates Rac1 from GDIα (19.DerMardirossian C.M. Bokoch G.M. Phosphorylation of RhoGDI by p21-activated kinase 1.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The activation of PAK1 in response to glucose occurs shortly after the activation of Cdc42 in MIN6 cells, and Cdc42 depletion ablates the glucose-induced activation of PAK1 (7.Wang Z. Oh E.

Chem. 2007; 282: 9536-9546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The onset of GSIS also stimulates the phosphorylation of PAK1 at Thr-423 and GDIα at Ser-174, which is presumably responsible for the activation and translocation of Cdc42 and Rac1 from cytoplasm to membrane of islet β-cells (6.Li J. Luo R. Kowluru A. Li G. Novel regulation by Rac1 of glucose- and forskolin-induced insulin secretion in INS-1 β-cells.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Despite the important role of PAK1 in regulating insulin exocytosis, little is known about the kinase regulator(s) responsible for the activation of PAK1 required for GSIS in islet β-cells. SAD-A, also referred to as BRSK2, is a serine/threonine protein kinase most closely related to AMP-activated protein kinase among the 12 members of AMP-activated protein kinase-related kinases (23.Alessi D.R. Sakamoto K. Bayascas J.R. LKB1-dependent signaling pathways.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 137-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Like PAK1, SAD-A and its highly conserved isoform, SAD-B, have recently been demonstrated to regulate neuronal polarity and axon specification (24.Kishi M. Pan Y.A. Crump J.G. Sanes J.R.

Pan Y.A. Crump J.G. Sanes J.R. Mammalian SAD kinases are required for neuronal polarization.Science. 2005; 307: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and as a downstream target of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway (27.Choi Y.J.

SAD-B has also been shown to be associated with synaptic vesicles where it regulates neurotransmitter release, possibly by phosphorylation of RIM1 (28.Inoue E. Mochida S. Takagi H. Higa S. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue M. Yao I. Takeuchi K. Kitajima I. Setou M. Ohtsuka T. Takai Y. SAD: a presynaptic kinase associated with synaptic vesicles and the active zone cytomatrix that regulates neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2006; 50: 261-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the SAD kinases are activated by [cAMP]/[Ca2+]-dependent signaling pathways, which play an essential role in regulating the onset of GSIS (29.Fujimoto T. Yurimoto S. Hatano N. Nozaki N. Sueyoshi N. Kameshita I. Mizutani A. Mikoshiba K. Kobayashi R. Tokumitsu H.

Despite exclusive expression of SAD-A in brain and pancreas, little is known about the biological function of SAD-A and its signaling events in the pancreas. In the present study, we demonstrated that SAD-A plays a critical role in regulating insulin secretion from islet β-cells through interaction with PAK1. We identified for the first time SAD-A as an activator of PAK1 required for the onset of GSIS. The results define a novel mechanism by which SAD-A could regulate other cellular events, such as neuronal polarity and exon specification, which are also regulated by PAK1 activation (12.Kreis P.

The coding region of the human SAD-A cDNA (AF533876) was amplified by PCR using human fetal brain Marathon-ready cDNA (BD Biosciences) and primers that add a FLAG tag at the N terminus and was subcloned to the HindIII and NotI site of pcDNA3.1. For retroviral expression, a BamHI and XhoI fragment from pcDNA3.1-SAD-A vector was subcloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of pBabe (puro) vector. Adenovirus expression of FLAG-SAD-A was generated by subcloning to the FLAG-SAD-A from pcDNA3.1-SAD-A into the BglII and NotI sites of pAdTrack CMV vector. Site-directed mutagenesis of plasmids was performed by using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA). The plasmids pGEX-PBD, pcDNA-myc-Cdc42 L61, and pcDNA-myc-PAK1 were used as described previously (32.Feng Q. Albeck J.G. Cerione R.A. Yang W.

The PAK1 mutant plasmids pCMV6M-PAK1 (P191G, P192A), pCMV6M-PAK1 K299R, and pCMV6M-PAK1 (H83L, H86L) were purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). Antibodies used in the present studies include αPAK1and c-Myc from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-FLAG M2 antibody, anti-β-actin antibody, and anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin from Sigma; and anti-phospho-PAK1 (Thr-423) from Cell Signaling (Boston, MA) and PhosphoSolutions (Aurora, CO). The SAD-A antibodies were a kind gift from Dr. Joshua Sanes. The purified GST-GDIα fusion protein was purchased from Cytoskeleton (Colorado Springs, CO). The oligopeptides were ordered from Peptide 2.0, Inc. (Chantilly, VA). P81 phosphocellulose paper was from Millipore (Billerica HQ, MA). Recombinant adenoviruses overexpressing PAK1 and its T423E and K299R mutants were purchased from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, CA). To evaluate SAD-A activity, 293T cells were transfected with various plasmid expression vectors for SAD-A and its mutants. After 24 h of incubation in DMEM containing 10% FBS, the cells were serum-starved for 8–20 h and then stimulated with or without 20% FBS for 15 min. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed at 4 °C in IP lysis buffer. Equal total protein was immunoprecipitated with 2.5 μg of anti-FLAG antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The resins were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm MnCl2) and were used for kinase assay in 30-μl reactions with 25 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 16 μg of Substrate for AMP-activated protein kinase (SAMS) peptide substrate. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reactions were stopped. Incorporation of [32P]phosphate into the peptide substrate was determined by applying the reaction mixture onto P81 phosphocellulose paper and scintillation counting after washing in 0.75% phosphoric acid. Similar assays were used to measure the activity in oligopeptides of GDIα and immunoprecipitates of PAK1 from 293T cells. SAD-A kinase assays were also carried out using partially purified recombinant human SAD-A protein overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells. Immunoprecipitates of PAK1 or its mutants from 293T cells were incubated in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer that contained 25 μm ATP at 37 °C for 10 min to reduce radioactive background from autophosphorylation followed by the addition of 1–5 μg of purified SAD-A protein and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was terminated after a 20-min incubation at 37 °C, and the resins were washed three times and boiled in gel loading buffer to elute radiolabeled immunocomplexes, which were resolved by SDS-PAGE and quantified by PhosphorImager screen. The confluent 293T cells transfected with the indicated expression vectors in a 60-mm dish were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and cleared by centrifugation. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. Immunocomplexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE. For GST pulldown assays, GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose following induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for the expression of the GST-PBD expression vector over 4 h at 30 °C in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells. The immobilized GST fusion proteins (20 μg) on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with mammalian cell lysates for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation, and then the resins were washed three times with bacterial lysis buffer. The binding proteins were eluted by boiling in sample loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western blot analysis. Islets were isolated from 8-week-old C57/Bl6 mice or 3-month-old SAD-A null mice and their wild type control mice by collagenase XI (Sigma) perfusion and Histopaque (Sigma) separation from acinar and ductal tissue. Islets were then handpicked and cultured for 8 h in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before assay for adenoviral infection and GSIS. For recombinant adenovirus-mediated overexpression, islets were infected at 4 × 106 pfu/islet with either wild type control adenoviruses or recombinant adenoviruses overexpressing the indicated kinases and their mutants. Insulin secretion studies were performed 48 h after infection and were analyzed in six repeated samples with 10 islets each. Islets were washed and preincubated in KRBH-BSA secretion buffer (114 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.16 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES, 0.2% BSA) with 2.8 mm glucose for 1 h followed by a 1-h incubation with 600 μl of KRBH-BSA containing the indicated concentrations of glucose or secretagogues. Insulin secretion levels were determined by an insulin RIA kit (Millipore, catalog number RI-13K) and were normalized to total cellular protein level. The MIN6 cells were cultured in DMEM with 15% FCS, 25 mm glucose, 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. MIN6 cells were infected with the recombinant adenoviruses expressing PAK1 or its mutants at multiplicity of infection 100 and assayed for GSIS 48 h after infection. Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out in MIN6 cells stably expressing SAD-A and its kinase-dead mutant or in HeLa cells transiently transfected with the indicated plasmid expression vectors using a protocol as described previously (33.Shi Y. An J. Liang J. Hayes S.E. Sandusky G.E. Stramm L.E. Yang N.N. Characterization of a mutant pancreatic eIF-2α kinase, PEK, and co-localization with somatostatin in islet delta cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5723-5730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MIN6 cells were seeded on a glass coverslip for 24 h and then fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature followed by 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 min. The cells were then stained with 200 ng/ml FITC-phalloidin (Sigma, P5282) in PBS for 30 min, rinsed three times in PBS, mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, H-1200), and examined by confocal microscopy. For HeLa cells, at 30 h after transfection, the cells were washed briefly with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min, and then treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The cells were then incubated with mouse anti-FLAG antibody for 3 h at room temperature. After being rinsed three times with PBS, the cells were then incubated with donkey anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with Cy3 for 1 h and washed briefly three times with PBS. The cells were then incubated in FITC-phalloidin (Sigma, P5282) diluted 200 ng/ml in PBS for 10 min, rinsed three times in PBS, mounted with Aqua-Poly/Mount, and examined by confocal microscopy. Results are shown as averages and S.E. Student's t test, nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test, or analysis of variance was used to calculate differences between groups where appropriate. *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01, and ***, p < 0.001 were considered statistically significant. The SAD-B kinase, a highly conserved isoform of SAD-A, has previously been shown to regulate neurotransmitter release (28.Inoue E. Mochida S. Takagi H. Higa S. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue M. Yao I. Takeuchi K. Kitajima I. Setou M. Ohtsuka T. Takai Y. SAD: a presynaptic kinase associated with synaptic vesicles and the active zone cytomatrix that regulates neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2006; 50: 261-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast to SAD-B kinase, which is exclusively expressed in brain, the SAD-A kinase also exhibits high expression in pancreas. 4J. Nie, B. Lilley, Y. Pan, C. Sun, G. Ye, O. Faruque, X. Liu, Z. Chang, W. Yang, J. Sanes, X. Han, and Y. Shi, submitted for publication. Because pancreatic β-cells share many common features with neurons in stimulus-secretion coupling, we investigated a role of SAD-A in regulating GSIS from isolated mouse islet and MIN6 islet β-cells. As shown by Fig. 1A, adenoviral overexpression of SAD-A, but not its kinase-dead mutant (K48M), significantly enhanced GSIS from isolated mouse islets. Conversely, SAD-A deficiency mediated by siRNA knockdown of the endogenous SAD-A significantly inhibited GSIS from cultured MIN6 cells (Fig. 1B). The results were further confirmed by lentiviral expression of the recombinant SAD-A and its mutants in MIN6 β-cells. The results show that overexpression of SAD-A significantly enhanced insulin secretion from MIN6 cells in response to stimulation with glucose and KCl (Fig. 1C). The potentiating effect by SAD-A on insulin secretion was abolished by mutations that ablated either the kinase activity (K48M) or the phosphorylation site of PKA (T260A) (17.Guo F. Debidda M. Yang L. Williams D.A. Zheng Y. Genetic deletion of Rac1 GTPase reveals its critical role in actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion complex assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18652-18659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), further implicating a regulatory role of SAD-A in enhancing insulin secretion. To identify downstream targets that mediate the effect of SAD-A on GSIS from pancreatic β-cells, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis using FLAG-tagged SAD-A stably expressed in MIN6 β-cells as the bait followed by mass spectrometric analysis of SAD-A-interacting proteins. The use of FLAG-tagged SAD-A bypasses the requirement of SAD-A antibodies for the Co-IP analysis because none of the known SAD-A antibodies including those previously developed by Dr. Sanes' laboratory at Harvard (24.Kishi M. Pan Y.A. Crump J.G. Sanes J.R. Mammalian SAD kinases are required for neuronal polarization.Science. 2005; 307: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) recognize the nondenatured SAD-A protein. One of the interactive proteins that demonstrated specific binding with SAD-A is the PAK1 kinase, which was further validated by Co-IP analysis of the interaction of SAD-A with the endogenous PAK1 protein in islet β-cells. As shown by Fig. 2, SAD-A specifically interacted with the endogenous PAK1 in MIN6 islet β-cells stably expressing the FLAG-tagged SAD-A when either the FLAG-tagged SAD-A (Fig. 2A) or the endogenous PAK1 (Fig. 2B) was used as the baits for the Co-IP analysis. The interaction was totally abolished by a point mutation that inactivates SAD-A kinase activity (K48M) (Fig. 2A), further confirming the specificity of the interaction. The results suggest a potential role of PAK1 as a novel substrate of SAD-A-mediated signaling transduction pathways in regulating GSIS from islet β-cells. The specificity of the interaction was further scrutinized by GST pulldown analysis using purified GST-PBD (for p21-binding domain) of PAK1 and protein lysate from MIN6 cells stably expressing the recombinant FLAG-SAD-A or the kinase-dead SAD-A mutant. We chose the PBD domain of PAK1 for the GST pulldown analysis because the PBD domain is a well characterized domain of PAK1 that mediates the protein-protein interaction (see below). Consistent with findings from the Co-IP analysis, the PBD domain of PAK1 specifically interacted with the recombinant SAD-A, which was demonstrated by the results of the GST pulldown analysis using the GST-PBD resin (Fig. 2C). Again, the interaction was totally abolished by the kinase-dead SAD-A (K48M). The results suggest that the formation of a relatively stable complex between SAD-A and PAK1 requires SAD-A being catalytically active. Although glucose enhanced the interaction in vivo in MIN6 cells by Co-IP analysis (Fig. 2, A and B), such an effect was not recapitulated in vitro by the pulldown assay (Fig. 2C). The differences are likely caused by the different environmental conditions between in vivo and in vitro experiments. In contrast to results shown in Fig. 2, A and B, which reflect interaction of SAD-A with the endogenous PAK1 in vivo inside β-cells, results shown in Fig. 2C were from experiments that were carried out in vitro using purified GST-PBD fusion overexpressed in E. coli. To decipher molecular mechanisms underlying the physical interaction between SAD-A and PAK1, we determined a role of major regulatory sites of PAK1 in mediating its interaction with SAD-A by generating mammalian expression vectors for Myc-tagged PAK1 and its functional mutants, including the binding site for Rac1 and Cdc42 (H83L/H86L), the binding site for αPIX (for Pak-interacting exchanger) (P191G/R192A), the ATP-binding site, which is required for kinase activity (K299R), and a substitution mutation (T423E), which renders PAK1 constitutively active (Fig. 3A) (18.Bokoch G.M. Biology of the p21-activated kinases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). To facilitate the Co-IP analysis, we first determined whether the protein interaction between SAD-A and PAK1 can be recapitulated in 293T cells, a cell type that is amenable to high transfection rate because MIN6 β-cells exhibit very low transfection efficiency of DNA vectors. The results show that SAD-A specifically interacted with PAK1 in 293T cells when either SAD-A (Fig. 3B) or PAK1 (Fig. 3C) was used as the bait for the Co-IP analysis. We next analyzed whether mutations of the PBD domains (H83L/H86L) would abolish the binding of PAK1 with SAD-A because SAD-A demonstrated selective binding to the PBD domain of PAK1 (Fig. 2C). The H83L/H86L mutations have previously been shown to abolish the binding of activated Cdc42 and Rac1 to PAK1 (10.Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J.

Chernoff J. p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) regulates cell motility in mammalian fibroblasts.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, our results show that the H83L/H86L mutations did not abolish the binding of PAK1 with SAD-A. To the contrary, the mutations significantly enhanced the binding of PAK1 with SAD-A (Fig. 3B). Likewise, the P191G/R192A mutations, which abolished the binding site for αPIX, another activator of PAK1, by acting synergistically with Rac1 and Cdc42 binding (32.Feng Q. Albeck J.G. Cerione R.A.

The results suggest that the SAD-A protein may compete with Cdc42 and αPIX for binding to PAK1. In contrast, the binding of SAD-A to PAK1 was totally abolished by the K299R mutation, w"
https://openalex.org/W2022532497,"The bone marrow niche keeps puzzling scientists in cancer and regenerative medicine. What elements constitute the niche and how it affects neighbor cells in different disease contexts remain to be a matter of debate and extensive investigation. The translational use of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in transplantation biology poses a challenge, given the propensity of these cells to remain quiescent. Although the niche is a good candidate to exploit for reprogramming HSCs and controlling their expansion, new studies have added to its complexity. In 'Bench to Bedside', Paul S. Frenette and Yuya Kunisaki examine these studies to discuss how new players and their signals are involved in HSC maintenance and what the implications are for the development of HSC-based therapies. Among the alterations occurring in leukemias, metabolic events seem to foster cancer progression but may also be involved in cancer predisposition. Rushdia Z. Yusuf, Ying-Hua Wang and David T. Scadden peruse recent clinical and experimental studies that look at myelodysplastic syndromes and secondary leukemias and argue how metabolic changes in these cancers may not only be cell autonomous but also can emanate from the bone marrow stroma. Targeting this niche may open new avenues to reduce the risk for secondary leukemias in cancer survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2040982194,"The human SKI-like (SKIL) gene encodes the SMAD transcriptional corepressor SNON that antagonizes TGF-β signaling. SNON protein levels are tightly regulated by the TGF-β pathway: whereas a short stimulation with TGF-β decreases SNON levels by its degradation via the proteasome, longer TGF-β treatment increases SNON levels by inducing SKIL gene expression. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the self-regulation of SKIL gene expression by SNON. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the human SKIL gene proximal promoter contains a TGF-β response element (TRE) bearing four groups of SMAD-binding elements that are also conserved in mouse. Two regions of 408 and 648 bp of the human SKIL gene (∼2.4 kb upstream of the ATG initiation codon) containing the core promoter, transcription start site, and the TRE were cloned for functional analysis. Binding of SMAD and SNON proteins to the TRE region of the SKIL gene promoter after TGF-β treatment was demonstrated by ChIP and sequential ChIP assays. Interestingly, the SNON-SMAD4 complex negatively regulated basal SKIL gene expression through binding the promoter and recruiting histone deacetylases. In response to TGF-β signal, SNON is removed from the SKIL gene promoter, and then the activated SMAD complexes bind the promoter to induce SKIL gene expression. Subsequently, the up-regulated SNON protein in complex with SMAD4 represses its own expression as part of the negative feedback loop regulating the TGF-β pathway. Accordingly, when the SNON-SMAD4 complex is absent as in some cancer cells lacking SMAD4 the regulation of some TGF-β target genes is modified."
https://openalex.org/W2100954028,"Statin therapy reduces the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), however, the person-to-person variability in response to statin therapy is not well understood. We have investigated the effect of genetic variation on the reduction of CHD events by pravastatin. First, we conducted a genome-wide association study of 682 CHD cases from the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) trial and 383 CHD cases from the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS), two randomized, placebo-controlled studies of pravastatin. In a combined case-only analysis, 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with differential CHD event reduction by pravastatin according to genotype (P<0.0001), and these SNPs were analyzed in a second stage that included cases as well as non-cases from CARE and WOSCOPS and patients from the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk/PHArmacogenomic study of Statins in the Elderly at risk for cardiovascular disease (PROSPER/PHASE), a randomized placebo controlled study of pravastatin in the elderly. We found that one of these SNPs (rs13279522) was associated with differential CHD event reduction by pravastatin therapy in all 3 studies: P = 0.002 in CARE, P = 0.01 in WOSCOPS, P = 0.002 in PROSPER/PHASE. In a combined analysis of CARE, WOSCOPS, and PROSPER/PHASE, the hazard ratio for CHD when comparing pravastatin with placebo decreased by a factor of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.52 to 0.75) for each extra copy of the minor allele (P = 4.8 × 10(-7)).

https://openalex.org/W1988222386,"Protein misfolding and aggregation are exacerbated by aging and diseases of protein conformation including neurodegeneration, metabolic diseases, and cancer. In the cellular environment, aggregates can exist as discrete entities, or heterogeneous complexes of diverse solubility and conformational state. In this study, we have examined the in vivo dynamics of aggregation using imaging methods including fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), to monitor the diverse biophysical states of expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) proteins expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that monomers, oligomers and aggregates co-exist at different concentrations in young and aged animals expressing different polyQ-lengths. During aging, when aggregation and toxicity are exacerbated, FCS-based burst analysis and purified single molecule FCS detected a populational shift toward an increase in the frequency of brighter and larger oligomeric species. Regardless of age or polyQ-length, oligomers were maintained in a heterogeneous distribution that spans multiple orders of magnitude in brightness. We employed genetic suppressors that prevent polyQ aggregation and observed a reduction in visible immobile species with the persistence of heterogeneous oligomers, yet our analysis did not detect the appearance of any discrete oligomeric states associated with toxicity. These studies reveal that the reversible transition from monomers to immobile aggregates is not represented by discrete oligomeric states, but rather suggests that the process of aggregation involves a more complex pattern of molecular interactions of diverse intermediate species that can appear in vivo and contribute to aggregate formation and toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1992439336,"Spinal muscular atrophy is a fatal genetic disease of motoneurons due to loss of full-length survival of motor neuron protein, the main product of the disease gene SMN1. Axonal SMN (a-SMN) is an alternatively spliced isoform of SMN1, generated by retention of intron 3. To study a-SMN function, we generated cellular clones for the expression of the protein in mouse motoneuron-like NSC34 cells. The model was instrumental in providing evidence that a-SMN decreases cell growth and plays an important role in the processes of axon growth and cellular motility. In our conditions, low levels of a-SMN expression were sufficient to trigger the observed biological effects, which were not modified by further increasing the amounts of the expressed protein. Differential transcriptome analysis led to the identification of novel a-SMN-regulated factors, i.e. the transcripts coding for the two chemokines, C-C motif ligands 2 and 7 (CCL2 and CCL7), as well as the neuronal and myotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1). a-SMN-dependent induction of CCL2 and IGF1 mRNAs resulted in increased intracellular levels and secretion of the respective protein products. Induction of CCL2 contributes to the a-SMN effects, mediating part of the action on axon growth and random cell motility, as indicated by chemokine knockdown and re-addition studies. Our results shed new light on a-SMN function and the underlying molecular mechanisms. The data provide a rational framework to understand the role of a-SMN deficiency in the etiopathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy."

https://openalex.org/W2020410568,"Gut-homing of donor T cells is causative for the development of intestinal GvHD in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Expression of the gut-specific homing receptors integrin-α4β7 and chemokine receptor CCR9 on T cells is imprinted in gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) under the influence of the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid. Here we addressed the role of vitamin A deficiency in HSCT-recipients for donor T cell migration in the course of experimental GvHD. Vitamin A-deficient (VAD) mice were prepared by feeding them a vitamin A-depleted diet. Experiments were performed in a C57BL/6 into BALB/c model of acute GvHD. We found that expression of integrin-α4β7 and CCR9 in GALT was reduced in VAD recipients after HSCT. Competitive in vivo homing assays showed that allogeneic T cells primed in VAD mice did not home as efficiently to the intestine as T cells primed in mice fed with standard diet (STD). The course of GvHD was ameliorated in VAD HSCT-recipients and, consequently, their survival was prolonged compared to recipients receiving STD. However, VAD-recipients were not protected and died of clinical GvHD. We found reduced numbers of donor T cells in the intestine but increased cell counts and tissue damage in other organs of VAD-recipients. Furthermore, we observed high IFN-γ(+)CD4(+) and low FoxP3(+)CD4(+) frequencies of total donor CD4(+) T cells in VAD as compared to STD recipients. Taken together, these results indicate that dietary vitamin A deficiency in HSCT-recipients changed target organ tropism in GvHD but also resulted in fatal inflammation after HSCT."
https://openalex.org/W2066755794,"The estimation of prediction quality is important because without quality measures, it is difficult to determine the usefulness of a prediction. Currently, methods for ligand binding site residue predictions are assessed in the function prediction category of the biennial Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment, utilizing the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and Binding-site Distance Test (BDT) metrics. However, the assessment of ligand binding site predictions using such metrics requires the availability of solved structures with bound ligands. Thus, we have developed a ligand binding site quality assessment tool, FunFOLDQA, which utilizes protein feature analysis to predict ligand binding site quality prior to the experimental solution of the protein structures and their ligand interactions. The FunFOLDQA feature scores were combined using: simple linear combinations, multiple linear regression and a neural network. The neural network produced significantly better results for correlations to both the MCC and BDT scores, according to Kendall’s τ, Spearman’s ρ and Pearson’s r correlation coefficients, when tested on both the CASP8 and CASP9 datasets. The neural network also produced the largest Area Under the Curve score (AUC) when Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis was undertaken for the CASP8 dataset. Furthermore, the FunFOLDQA algorithm incorporating the neural network, is shown to add value to FunFOLD, when both methods are employed in combination. This results in a statistically significant improvement over all of the best server methods, the FunFOLD method (6.43%), and one of the top manual groups (FN293) tested on the CASP8 dataset. The FunFOLDQA method was also found to be competitive with the top server methods when tested on the CASP9 dataset. To the best of our knowledge, FunFOLDQA is the first attempt to develop a method that can be used to assess ligand binding site prediction quality, in the absence of experimental data."

The functional role of native PrP is not fully understood. PrP is associated with a number of different prionoses, both sporadic, inherited, and acquired, all of which are invariably fatal. The common molecular pathognomonic marker for prionoses is the presence of severe vacuolation within the CNS rendering a sponge-like tissue. Concomitant with the presence of spongiosis is the presence of a conformational isoform of PrP, which has converted from a largely helical globular protein PrPC that misfolds into an aggregation prone β-sheet conformation, PrPSc, which often assemble into protein deposits with conspicuous similarities to amyloid (1.Cobb N.J.

Taken together, there is ample evidence that position 129 in PrP is a key site for prion disease susceptibility and hence most likely for PrP misfolding. The effect of the natural polymorphism at position 129 has been studied in vitro in several studies regarding both amyloid fibrillation kinetics and oligomerization. Reorganization of HuPrP(90–231) into mature amyloid fibrils under denaturing conditions is enhanced if position 129 encodes a valine, whereas methionine in this position favors formation of soluble oligomers (20.Lewis P.A.

I., Vendruscolo, M., Dobson, C. M., Knowles, T. P. (2012) From macroscopic measurements to microscopic mechanisms of protein aggregation. J. Mol. Biol. doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2012.02.031Google Scholar). Because nucleation is a multiorder reaction, its rate especially at low protein concentrations should be stochastic. This feature is reflected by a time variation of the lag phase of fibril formation (24.Hortschansky P. Schroeckh V. Christopeit T. Zandomeneghi G. Fändrich M. The aggregation kinetics of Alzheimer β-amyloid peptide is controlled by stochastic nucleation.Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1753-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). During amyloidogenesis, the fibril elongates through monomer addition and conversion, and in addition, the fibril is fragmented leading to multiplication of fibril elongation sites. It is thus evident that fragmentation of amyloid fibrils is of great importance for fibril replication. The rate of the growth phase is a measure of fibril fragility rather than of cooperativity in monomer addition (25.Collins S.R. Douglass A. Vale R.D. Weissman J.S.

The amyloid formation pathways of many proteins involve formation of oligomeric species. These oligomers comprise varying numbers of non-native protein molecules, but most often, they do not display the features of amyloid regarding ThT fluorescence. It has been shown that oligomers of many proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases are the most toxic species in cell culture (28.Sörgjerd K. Klingstedt T. Lindgren M. Kågedal K. Hammarström P.

PrP forms oligomers via different pathways, giving rise to different distinctly different oligomers from the same primary structure (32.Eghiaian F. Daubenfeld T. Quenet Y. van Audenhaege M.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The formation of different oligomers can also be modulated by the polymorphism in position 129. The propensity to form oligomers and the properties of the oligomers are not affected by the polymorphism, but the stacking of oligomers was suggested to be aggravated by the valine residue (33.Gerber R. Voitchovsky K. Mitchel C. Tahiri-Alaoui A. Ryan J.F. Hore P.J. James W. Interoligomer interactions of the human prion protein are modulated by the polymorphism at codon 129.J. Mol.

In our current study, we elucidated the conformational stability and amyloid propensity of recombinant HuPrP(90–231) with variations in position 129. We made use of the range of properties offered by amino acid substitution. To investigate the role of increasing number of methyl groups, alanine, valine, and leucine were used. To elucidate the role of the sulfur atom in the wild type methionine, cysteine was included in the study. Lysine and glutamic acid should give information on the involvement of electrostatic interactions. Tryptophan was employed to examine influence of bulkiness. Proline was used to investigate how rotational constraint influences amyloid formation. Plasmids (pRSET-A) containing HuPrP WT (Met129) genes of desired lengths were obtained from K. Wüthrich (34.Hornemann S. Christen B. von Schroetter C. Pérez D.R. Wüthrich K. Prion protein library of recombinant constructs for structural biology.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 2359-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions, and mutants were verified by DNA sequencing (GATC Biotechnology, Konstanz, Germany). The plasmids were transformed into BL21/DE3 cells and were grown on plates overnight. The cells were transferred to 1.5 liters of Terrific Broth (MP Biochemicals) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking. At A600 ∼ 2.5, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mm to induce protein production. Agitation at 37 °C was maintained during protein expression, and cells were harvested by centrifugation after overnight induction, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer G (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm Na2PO4, 10 mm reduced glutathione) and frozen at −80 °C until needed. After thawing, sonication, and centrifugation, the soluble fraction was added to 3 ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) in a disposable column. The agarose was washed with 10 ml of buffer G, 7 ml of 50% buffer G and 50% buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0), 5 ml of buffer B, and finally, 5 ml of buffer B supplemented with 50 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted using 10 ml of buffer E (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm Na2PO4, 500 mm imidazole, pH 5.8). The washing procedure was repeated until the elution fractions no longer contained protein detectable by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The elution fractions were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column (GE Healthcare) using a BioLogic LP system (Bio-Rad) with a continuous flow rate of 1 ml/min. Buffer F (50 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl) was used for running buffer. Purity of obtained proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (35.Almstedt K. Nyström S. Nilsson K.P. Hammarström P. Amyloid fibrils of human prion protein are spun and woven from morphologically disordered aggregates.Prion. 2009; 3: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All described experiments with PrP were conducted in a biosafety P3** facility. A Chirascan CD spectrometer (Applied Photophysics) and 1-mm cuvette was used for all measurements. Far UV spectra between 195 and 250 nm were measured at 4 °C to assess the native protein structure. All measurements were performed with PrP dissolved in Buffer F. Thermal denaturation was monitored by recording the molar ellipticity at 222 nm, whereas the sample was heated from 4 to 90 °C at 1 °C/min. The sample was cooled down, and the far UV spectrum was again measured at 4 °C for the refolded protein. The respective Tm value was calculated according to John et al. (36.John D.M. Weeks K.M. van't Hoff enthalpies without baselines.Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The protein was diluted in buffer F to the desired concentration (6 μm), ThT was added to a concentration of 2 μm, and the protein solution was aliquoted (100 μl) into the wells of microtiter plates (CoStar NT 96-well, black with clear bottom, Corning). The plate was sealed with sealing tape. Typically, six identical samples were prepared for each fibrillation experiment. The plate was shaken in a Tecan SafireII plate reader at high speed in linear mode. Every 15 min, the shaking was halted, and fluorescence intensity was measured form the bottom of the plate by excitation at 440 nm and emission at 480 nm. Kinetic traces were fitted according to Almstedt et al. (35.Almstedt K. Nyström S. Nilsson K.P. Hammarström P. Amyloid fibrils of human prion protein are spun and woven from morphologically disordered aggregates.Prion. 2009; 3: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to obtain the lag phase and the growth rate for each trajectory. Statistical analyses comparing experiments were performed using unpaired two-tailed t test using GraphPad Prism software (version 5). A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Congo red for microscopy analysis was added to mature fibrils in solution at a molar ratio of fibril:dye 3:1. Stained fibrils were left to self-sediment overnight at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pelleted fibrils were transferred to Superfrost plus glass slides (Thermo Fisher, Waldorf, Germany) and covered with Mounting medium (Dako, Glosrup, Denmark), and coverglass was sealed with transparent nail polish. Congo red-stained samples were analyzed using a Nikon light microscope equipped with polarizers for both incoming light and in front of the detector. The conformation of the native HuPrP(90–231) protein variants was monitored by far-UV CD spectroscopy. All variants displayed a spectrum with two negative peaks at 222 and 208 nm followed by a positive peak at wavelengths below 200 nm (Fig. 1a). These features are consistent with native folded PrP dominated by α-helical structure and is in agreement with spectra in the literature (37.Swietnicki W. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Familial mutations and the thermodynamic stability of the recombinant human prion protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31048-31052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic stability of the protein variants was thereafter monitored by far-UV CD spectroscopy. Spectra were recorded at 4 °C, followed by sequential steps of thermal denaturation monitored at 222 nm. After complete denaturation at 90 °C, the sample was cooled to 4 °C, and far-UV CD spectra were recorded again to assess any irreversible change of secondary structure upon one unfolding-refolding cycle. All mutants except for M129P showed similar far UV CD spectra before denaturation (Fig. 1a). M129P displayed decreased positive amplitude between 195 and 200 nm compared with WT PrP, with a concomitant shift of the peak toward 197 nm indicating loss of helical structure (38.Kelly S.M. Jess T.J. Price N.C. How to study proteins by circular dichroism.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1751: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar). The thermal stability curves of all mutants showed a sloping pretransitional baseline followed by a cooperative thermal unfolding transition. Comparing the thermal stability of the mutants showed that the WT, M129V, M129L, M129K, and M129C were the most stable, and all within error showed Tm values of 65–66 °C (Fig. 1b and Table 1). The M129A, M129E, and M129W mutants were destabilized by 3–4 °C, and M129P was the most destabilized mutant with a Tm lowered by 7.2 °C. After thermal denaturation, refolding was allowed at 4 °C, and the reversibility of the thermal unfolding was compared. Interestingly, the spectral feature of M129P described above at 197 nm also appeared in the spectra for M129W and M129E and, to some extent, M129A (Fig. 1c) after refolding. The M129P, M129W, M129E, and M129A mutants were also the most destabilized mutants and the amplitude of the irreversibility at 195–200 nm correlated well with the respective Tm. Traditionally, the amount of α-helix and reversibility of helical structure is easily assessed at 222 nm. The reversibility of the CD signal at 222 nm for M129C and M129W showed the largest difference between the predenaturation and postdenaturation spectra (Fig. 1c), corroborating the spectral findings discussed above in the 195–200 nm region. The difference in molar ellipticity at 222 nm in the spectrum before and after thermal denaturation was between 9–12% for stable variants and 15–22% for mutants with lower Tm values. One of the most stable variants, M129C, also displays the largest loss of helical structure upon refolding. This mutant lost 30% of its helical structure upon thermal denaturation-refolding (Table 1).TABLE 1Conformational stability and properties of HuPrP(90–231) mutantsHuPrP mutantTmaMidpoint of thermal denaturation measured by far UV circular dichroism at 222 nm.ΔTmbDifference in midpoint of thermal denaturation in comparison with WT (129M).Loss of α-helixcBased on change in mean residue ellipticity measured by far UV circular dichroism at 222 nm before and after one round of thermal denaturation at 4–90 °C.Accessible non-polar surface areadData referring to the substituted amino acid obtained from Koh et al.

Open table in a new tab As a reference for the CD measurements, the shorter variant HuPrP(121–231) (Met129) comprising only the folded globular domain was employed. Comparing the shorter 121–231 construct and longer 90–231 construct (HuPrP(90–231)), the native spectrum, Tm, and reversibility was indistinguishable within error for these parameters (Table 1) but did reveal a more cooperative thermal transition compared with the longer construct (Fig. 1b). Nevertheless, the identical Tm rules out strong interactions between the globular domain 121–231 with the unstructured partial N-terminal 90–120 domain on the folding properties of HuPrP(90–231) in this assay. Previously, we have described in detail that vigorous shaking of natively folded PrP in 2-ml cryotubes induced protein aggregation and amyloidogenesis in physiological buffer at 37 °C (35.Almstedt K. Nyström S. Nilsson K.P. Hammarström P. Amyloid fibrils of human prion protein are spun and woven from morphologically disordered aggregates.Prion. 2009; 3: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Aggregates produced according to this protocol were collected after 7 h of agitation, stained with Congo red, and placed on glass slides. Imaging with a polarization microscope revealed that all mutants except for M129C formed Congo red-stained birefringent aggregates, indicating the presence of symmetric Congo red binding sites, the tinctorial hallmark of amyloid fibrils (Fig. 2a). The aggregates of all mutants except for M129C were also positive for ThT fluorescence following excitation at 440 nm with an emission peak at 485 nm, which was absent for native protein (Fig. 2b). The ThT fluorescence intensity of the fibrils varied depending on mutant (Table 2).TABLE 2Tinctorial properties of HuPrP(90–231) amyloid fibrilsHuPrP mutantCRaCongo red (CR) birefringence in crossed polarized light microscopy of fibrils formed after 24 h.ThTbThT fluorescence intensity relative to WT (129M) set to 100%, using a fluorescence plate reader of fibrils formed after 7 h in cryo tubes.+/−Intensity, % of WTWT (129M)+100 ± 30M129A+90 ± 20M129V+80 ± 10M129L+140 ± 40M129P+150 ± 20M129W+40 ± 20M129E+90 ± 20M129K+170 ± 20M129C−10 ± 20a Congo red (CR) birefringence in crossed polarized light microscopy of fibrils formed after 24 h.b ThT fluorescence intensity relative to WT (129M) set to 100%, using a fluorescence plate reader of fibrils formed after 7 h in cryo tubes. Open table in a new tab The lack of correlation between thermal stability and refolding capability together with the inability to form Congo red and ThT-positive fibrils of M129C led us to investigate whether this was due to intermolecular disulfide formation. Aliquots from fibrillation reactions of WT and M129C were collected at 0 min, 15 min, 2 h, and 4 h. Samples were boiled in non-reducing SDS containing sample loading buffer and loaded on SDS-PAGE gels followed by Coomassie staining. The WT displayed distinct monomeric band during the monitored time course. In the case of M129C, a dimeric protein was present already at the initial time point. As fibrillation proceeded, the monomeric band faded, and the dimeric band was enhanced (Fig. 3). At the end of the time course, a faint tetrameric band could also be observed. Dimer formation should be caused by intermolecular disulfide formation between cysteine residues at position 129. Formation of amyloid fibrils of HuPrP under near physiological conditions was monitored by measuring ThT fluorescence intensity during the fibrillation process in a 96-well plate format. Six separate samples of identical composition were used for each PrP variant. Every individual trace showed a characteristic lag, growth, and equilibrium trajectory (Fig. 4a, red lines). This is consistent with the notion that the amyloid fibrillation process of PrP is a nucleation-dependent polymerization reaction. The ensembles of individual mutant trajectories of identical samples revealed that the protein showed a rather variable lag phase, indicating that PrP fibrillation kinetics is a process with a stochastic component, which appeared to be mutation-dependent. This notion is consistent with previous data showing an initial aggregation reaction preceding fibril formation, which renders a kinetic trap from which fibrils protrude (35.Almstedt K. Nyström S. Nilsson K.P. Hammarström P. Amyloid fibrils of human prion protein are spun and woven from morphologically disordered aggregates.Prion. 2009; 3: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This is the background for the variations noted in the fibrillation trajectories. Lag times for all mutants are listed in Table 3. Comparing lag times during the spontaneous fibril formation reaction the wild type-like mutants (M129A, M129V, and M129L) were within the same interval as the WT (∼5 h) (Fig. 4, a and b, and Table 3). Substitutions to conformationally constrained proline, bulky tryptophan, or charged residues (glutamic acid and lysine) substantially elongated the lag time of amyloid formation (Fig. 4b and Table 3). The M129C mutant did not form ThT-positive fibrils within the time course of the experiment (Fig. 4a, note the different y axis, and Table 3).TABLE 3Kinetic parameters of amyloid fibril formation of HuPrP(90–231) under near physiological conditions assessed by ThT fluorescenceHuPrP mutantLag timeGrowth rateConversion ratioaSamples/total number of samples that displayed ThT fluorescence within 24 h.hh−1WT (129M) Unseeded4.6 ± 1.10.37 ± 0.146/6 Seeded1.5 ± 0.20.44 ± 0.096/6M129A Unseeded5.3 ± 0.90.38 ± 0.136/6 Seeded1.6 ± 0.30.28 ± 0.036/6M129V Unseeded5.3 ± 1.60.11 ± 0.066/6 Seeded2.9 ± 1.00.11 ± 0.026/6M129L Unseeded5.4 ± 2.00.17 ± 0.036/6 Seeded2.4 ± 0.10.13 ± 0.026/6M129P Unseeded11.8 ± 8.010.22 ± 0.064/6 Seeded2.6 ± 0.50.24 ± 0.186/6M129W Unseeded14.7 ± 2.10.10 ± 0.036/6 Seeded2.2 ± 0.20.54 ± 0.066/6M129E Unseeded10.3 ± 1.00.14 ± 0.076/6 Seeded3.4 ± 0.70.13 ± 0.026/6M129K Unseeded8.3 ± 0.30.11 ± 0.053/6 Seeded10.4 ± 2.40.15 ± 0.066/6M129C Unseeded>24 hN.D.bN.D., not determined.0/6 Seeded>24 hN.D.0/6 Seed"
https://openalex.org/W1986006863,"Local adaptation is central for creating and maintaining spatial variation in plant-herbivore interactions. Short-lived insect herbivores feeding on long-lived plants are likely to adapt to their local host plants, because of their short generation time, poor dispersal, and geographically varying selection due to variation in plant defences. In a reciprocal feeding trial, we investigated the impact of geographic variation in plant secondary chemistry of a long-lived plant, Vincetoxicum hirundinaria, on among-population variation in local adaptation of a specialist leaf-feeding herbivore, Abrostola asclepiadis. The occurrence and degree of local adaptation varied among populations. This variation correlated with qualitative and quantitative differences in plant chemistry among the plant populations. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms driving variation in local adaptation in this specialized plant-herbivore interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2082298276,"Traditionally, ecologists use lattice (regional summary) count data to simulate tree species distributions to explore species coexistence. However, no previous study has explicitly compared the difference between using lattice count and basal area data and analyzed species distributions at both individual species and community levels while simultaneously considering the combined scenarios of life stage and scale. In this study, we hypothesized that basal area data are more closely related to environmental variables than are count data because of strong environmental filtering effects. We also address the contribution of niche and the neutral (i.e., solely dependent on distance) factors to species distributions. Specifically, we separately modeled count data and basal area data while considering life stage and scale effects at the two levels with simultaneous autoregressive models and variation partitioning. A principal coordinates of neighbor matrix (PCNM) was used to model neutral spatial effects at the community level. The explained variations of species distribution data did not differ significantly between the two types of data at either the individual species level or the community level, indicating that the two types of data can be used nearly identically to model species distributions. Neutral spatial effects represented by spatial autoregressive parameters and the PCNM eigenfunctions drove species distributions on multiple scales, different life stages and individual species and community levels in this plot. We concluded that strong neutral spatial effects are the principal mechanisms underlying the species distributions and thus shape biodiversity spatial patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2096161691,"Female mice lacking group IVA phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g4a(-/-)) have a smaller litter size, which is due, in part, to defective implantation. We examined PLA(2)G4A dependence of the processes of ovulation and fertilization. Following induction of ovulation by equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG)/human CG (hCG) treatment and mating, ovulation and fertilization rates were reduced significantly in Pla2g4a(-/-) mice as compared to wild-type littermates. Human CG triggered robust ovarian prostaglandin (PG) E(2) production in the preovulatory period that was significantly attenuated in Pla2g4a(-/-) mice. Human CG transiently enhanced ovarian expression of PLA(2)G4A and prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) in wild-type mice. This PTGS2 induction was decreased in Pla2g4a(-/-) mice and also in immature rats treated with the PLA(2)G4A inhibitor, archidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone. A close spatiotemporal association of PLA(2)G4A with PTGS2 was found in mouse and rat preovulatory follicles examined by immunohistochemistry. Less association was observed with 4 other forms of PLA(2). Our data strongly suggest that PLA(2)G4A amplifies hCG induction of PTGS2 and colocalizes with the induced PTGS2, thus contributing to robust PG production required for optimal ovulation and fertilization in rodents."

We hypothesized that there are additional SH2 effectors that bind to EPO-R Tyr-343 and play a role in earlier steps of erythroid development. We performed an expression screen utilizing a tyrosine-phosphorylated EPO-R Tyr-343 peptide to address this question, and we identified the adaptor protein SH2B1 (SH2-B/PSM) as an EPO-R Tyr-343-binding partner. SH2B1 is a member of the SH2B family of adaptor proteins, whose other members include SH2B2 (APS) and SH2B3 (Lnk). All three members contain N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) and dimerization domains, a C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and several proline-rich regions (24.Maures T.J. Kurzer J.H.

A day 16 murine embryo phage expression library (Novagen, Madison, WI) was diluted at 4 × 104 pfu/plate, and protein expression was induced as per manufacturer's instructions. The nitrocellulose filters containing immobilized proteins were washed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and blocked overnight in TBST containing 2% (w/v) BSA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) (Buffer A). Biotinylated EPO-R peptides were briefly incubated with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase, conjugated, and mixed with Buffer A. Blocked filters were incubated in blocking buffer at room temperature for 3 h with biotinylated peptides (25 pmol/ml). Filters were washed five times with TBST, and detection was performed with a colorimetric nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3′indolyl phosphate p-toluidine (ThermoScientific, Rockford, IL) reaction. Plaques interacting with EPO-R Tyr(P)-343 were back-screened with a nonphosphorylated EPO-R Tyr-343 peptide. Plaques that specifically interacted with EPO-R Tyr(P)-343 were purified, and plasmid DNA was isolated from the phage according to the manufacturer's directions, and inserts were sequenced.

Ba/F3-EPO-R cells were maintained in their log phase of growth prior to transfection. The cells were washed once with RPMI 1640 medium and resuspended at 107 cells/200 μl. The cells were incubated with 1 μg of siRNA in a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were pulsed once at 300 V, 450 microfarads using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II electroporator. The cells were then resuspended in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium/IL3/G418. Ba/F3, DA-3, and HCD-57 cells were washed three times in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks' balanced salts, incubated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol for 4 h at 37 °C and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml murine recombinant IL-3, 50 units/ml murine recombinant IL-2, human recombinant EPO, or vehicle for 10 min at 37 °C. 293T cells were washed three times with PBS and starved in DME H-21 supplemented with 2.5 mg/ml BSA overnight at 37 °C. The cells were stimulated with 5 units/ml human recombinant EPO or vehicle for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed once in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks' balanced salts containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin A. After 5 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The polyclonal SH2B1 antibody that recognizes amino acids 527–670 of SH2B1β was produced by Antibodies Inc. (Davis, CA). Purified GST-SH2B1 fusion protein (corresponding to amino acids 527–670) was used to immunize rabbits.

The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, 4G10, and the total JAK2 antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-Tyr(P)-479 EPO-R, anti-EPO-R, monoclonal anti-GST and phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). SH2B1 specific antibodies used for immunoblotting were graciously provided by Dr. Liangyou Rui (University of Michigan). Antibodies along with a 50-μl volume of protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 2 mg of lysates for an overnight incubation. The beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer. The immune complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for Western blotting. Two mg of cell lysate were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with GST fusion proteins expressing the SH2 domain of SH2B1β immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer, and precipitated complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer with 100 mm DTT. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Following the electrophoretic transfer of proteins to PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the membranes were blocked at room temperature with 2.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with an optimal concentration of the primary antibody in TBST for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, washed four times in TBST, and incubated with the relevant HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30–60 min. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with autoradiographic film (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For reprobing, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C, rinsed twice in TBST, and blocked in 2.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline prior to primary antibody incubation. Western blots were scanned using film exposures in the linear range and quantified using ImageJ software. Following SH2B1 immunoprecipitation, the Sepharose beads were washed twice in dephosphorylation buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.5)). The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in dephosphorylation buffer, and 30 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was added to the beads and incubated at 30 °C. To terminate the reaction, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the beads, and the sample was boiled to elute off the bound protein. C57/Bl6 mice (8–12 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally on days 1 and 2 with a sterile solution of phenylhydrazine (6 mg/ml) in PBS solution (final dose, 60 mg/kg) (15.Barber D.L. Beattie B.K.

After the mice were sacrificed on day 5, a single spleen cell suspension was prepared. Cells were washed once in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and Hanks' balanced salts and starved in Iscove's media containing 2% fetal calf serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol for 4 h at 37 °C.

Lysates were prepared as described above. Studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We hypothesized that in addition to Stat5, EPO-R Tyr-343 may recruit other SH2 signaling effectors. SH2 effectors that bind to EPO-R Tyr-343 were identified in an unbiased fashion via COLT screening (35.Liu S.K. McGlade C.J.

A biotinylated EPO-R Tyr(P)-343 phosphopeptide was utilized to screen a murine day 16 embryonic library. Positive clones were back-screened with an identical EPO-R Tyr-343 nonphosphorylated peptide. Clones that met this specificity selection were sequenced. All were found to contain an SH2 domain. One of the clones isolated corresponded to the SH2 adaptor protein SH2B1β (27.Rui L. Mathews L.S.

To examine the specificity of the EPO-R/SH2B1β interaction, isolated SH2B1β plaques were incubated with specific biotinylated EPO-R phosphopeptides corresponding to the sequences of the eight EPO-R cytoplasmic tyrosines (Fig. 1). In addition to EPO-R Tyr(P)-343, EPO-R Tyr(P)-401 and EPO-R Tyr(P)-429 were also found to interact with SH2B1β, although to a lower extent.

Considering that SH2B1 was characterized as a JAK2-binding partner (27.Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Identification of SH2-Bβ as a substrate of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 involved in growth hormone signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we were interested in determining the role of SH2B1 in EPO-mediated signaling pathways. To investigate the role of SH2B1 in EPO signaling, we tested Ba/F3 and DA-3 hematopoietic cells, transfected to express EPO-R, as well as HCD-57 cells expressing endogenous EPO-R. These cells were depleted of cytokine and then incubated with no factor or with IL-3 or EPO. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using a polyclonal SH2B1 antibody, followed by Western blotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. Upon EPO stimulation, SH2B1 co-immunoprecipitated a phosphoprotein with a molecular weight corresponding to EPO-R in all cell lines (Fig. 2A, lanes 3, 6, and 8). To show that the phosphoprotein that co-immunoprecipitates with SH2B1 is EPO-R, a Tyr(P)-343-EPO-R specific antibody was also used for immunoblotting. Fig. 2B confirms that the phosphoprotein that co-IPs with SH2B1 (lanes 6 and 8) is indeed phosphorylated EPO-R (lanes 2 and 4). COLT screening suggested that SH2B1 bound to EPO-R in an SH2 domain-dependent manner. In vitro mixing experiments were performed utilizing the following fusion proteins: GST-SH2B1 SH2, GST-SH2B1 SH2 R555K (an inactive SH2 domain mutant), and GST-Ship SH2 as a positive control (29.Mason J.M.

https://openalex.org/W1968041222,"Background Recent results in birds, marsupials, rodents and nonhuman primates suggest that phylogeny and ecological factors such as body size, diet and postural habit of a species influence limb usage and the direction and strength of limb laterality. To examine to which extent these findings can be generalised to small-bodied rooting quadrupedal mammals, we studied trees shrews (Tupaia belangeri). Methodology/Principal Findings We established a behavioural test battery for examining paw usage comparable to small-bodied primates and tested 36 Tupaia belangeri. We studied paw usage in a natural foraging situation (simple food grasping task) and measured the influence of varying postural demands (triped, biped, cling, sit) on paw preferences by applying a forced-food grasping task similar to other small-bodied primates. Our findings suggest that rooting tree shrews prefer mouth over paw usage to catch food in a natural foraging situation. Moreover, we demonstrated that despite differences in postural demand, tree shrews show a strong and consistent individual paw preference for grasping across different tasks, but no paw preference at a population level. Conclusions/Significance Tree shrews showed less paw usage than small-bodied quadrupedal and arboreal primates, but the same paw preference. Our results confirm that individual paw preferences remain constant irrespective of postural demand in some small-bodied quadrupedal non primate and primate mammals which do not require fine motoric control for manipulating food items. Our findings suggest that the lack of paw/hand preference for grasping food at a population level is a universal pattern among those species and that the influence of postural demand on manual lateralisation in quadrupeds may have evolved in large-bodied species specialised in fine manipulations of food items."

The aim of this study was to generate a cell line derived from a paediatric HCC in order to expand research in this field. We established the HC-AFW1 cell line from a liver neoplasm of a 4-year-old boy through culturing of primary tumor specimens. The cell line has been stable for over one year of culturing and has a doubling time of 40 h. The tumour cells have an epithelial histology and express HCC-associated proteins such as Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Glypican 3, E-cadherin, CD10, CD326, HepPar1 and Vimentin. Forty-nine amino acids in exon 3 of β-Catenin that involve the phosphorylation sites of GSK3 were absent and β-Catenin is detectable in the cell nuclei. Cytogenetic analysis revealed large anomalies in the chromosomal map. Several alterations of gene copy numbers were detected by genome-wide SNP array. Among the different drugs tested, cisplatin and irinotecan showed effective inhibition of tumour cell growth in a proliferation assay at concentrations below 5 µg/ml. Subcutaneous xenotransplantation of HC-AFW1 cells into NOD/SCID mice resulted in fast growing dedifferentiated tumours with high levels of serum AFP. Histological analyses of the primary tumour and xenografts included national and international expert pathological review. Consensus reading characterised the primary tumour and the HC-AFW1-derived tumours as HCC. HC-AFW1 is the first cell line derived from a paediatric HCC without a background of viral hepatitis or cirrhosis and represents a valuable tool for investigating the biology of and therapeutic strategies for childhood HCC."

https://openalex.org/W2137893910,"The p53 transcription factor and tumor suppressor is regulated primarily by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, which ubiquitinates p53 to target it for proteasomal degradation. Aside from its ubiquitin ligase function, Mdm2 has been believed to be capable of suppressing p53's transcriptional activity by binding with and masking the transactivation domain of p53. The ability of Mdm2 to restrain p53 activity by binding alone, without ubiquitination, was challenged by a 2007 study using a knockin mouse harboring a single cysteine-to-alanine point mutation (C462A) in Mdm2's RING domain. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts with this mutation, which abrogates Mdm2's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity without affecting its ability to bind with p53, were unable to suppress p53 activity. In this study, we utilized the Mdm2(C462A) mouse model to characterize in further detail the role of Mdm2's RING domain in the control of p53. Here, we show in vivo that the Mdm2(C462A) protein not only fails to suppress p53, but compared to the complete absence of Mdm2, Mdm2(C462A) actually enhances p53 transcriptional activity toward p53 target genes p21/CDKN1A, MDM2, BAX, NOXA, and 14-3-3σ. In addition, we found that Mdm2(C462A) facilitates the interaction between p53 and the acetyltransferase CBP/p300, and it fails to heterodimerize with its homolog and sister regulator of p53, Mdmx, suggesting that a fully intact RING domain is required for Mdm2's inhibition of the p300-p53 interaction and for its interaction with Mdmx. These findings help us to better understand the complex regulation of the Mdm2-p53 pathway and have important implications for chemotherapeutic agents targeting Mdm2, as they suggest that inhibition of Mdm2's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity may be sufficient for increasing p53 activity in vivo, without the need to block Mdm2-p53 binding."
https://openalex.org/W2111440152,"Locus control regions (LCRs) comprise sets of DNA elements capable of establishing autonomous chromatin domains that support robust and physiologically appropriate expression of target genes, often working over extensive distances. Human growth hormone (hGH-N) expression in the pituitary is under the regulation of a well characterized LCR containing four DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSs). The two pituitary-specific HS, HSI and HSII, are located 14.5 and 15.5 kb 5' to the hGH-N promoter. HSI is essential for activation of hGH-N during pituitary development and for sustaining robust activity in the adult. To determine whether the closely linked HSII has a role in hGH-N expression, it was deleted from a previously validated hGH/P1 transgene. Analysis of three independent hGH/P1(ΔHSII) transgenic mouse lines revealed that this deletion had no adverse effect on the formation of HSI, yet resulted in a substantial loss (70%) in hGH-N mRNA expression. This loss of expression was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in recruitment of the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1 to the hGH-N promoter and a selective decrease in promoter occupancy of the elongation-linked isoform of RNA polymerase II. Sufficiency of HSI and HSII in LCR activity was explored by establishing two additional sets of mouse transgenic lines in which DNA segments containing these HS were positioned within the λ phage genome. In this ""neutral"" DNA context, HSII was required for the recruitment of HAT activity. These data establish HSII as a nonredundant component of the hGH LCR essential for establishment of robust levels of hGH-N gene expression."

Because it has been suggested that organohalogenated contaminants could influence IGF-I levels in adults, the potential relationship between DL-PCBs and IGF-I serum levels was studied in 456 healthy adults from a representative sample of the general population of the Canary Islands (Spain).Free circulating serum levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were measured through an ELISA methodology, while the serum levels of the 12 DL-PCBs congeners (IUPAC numbers # 77, 81, 105, 114, 118, 123, 126, 156, 157, 167, 169, and 189) were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS).DL-PCBs 156 and 167, Total DL-PCBs body burden (∑PCBs: sum over the 12 measured DL-PCBs), and Total toxic burden (in terms of toxic equivalence to dioxins: ∑TEQs) showed a trend of inverse association with IGF-I serum levels in the whole studied population. After adjusting for potential confounders, including gender, body mass index (BMI), age, and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), younger (18-45 years) women with lower BMI (<27 kg/m(2)) and detectable levels of DL-PCB-156 showed significantly lower IGF-I levels than those in the same age and BMI subgroup with non-detectable levels of DL-PCB-156 (p<0.001). Similarly, ∑PCBs and ∑TEQs showed a tendency to an inverse association with IGF-I levels in the same group of women (p=0.017 and p=0.019 respectively).These findings suggest that DL-PCBs could be involved in the regulation of the IGF-system in a way possibly influenced by gender, age and BMI. Although these results should be interpreted with caution, such circumstances could contribute to explain the development of diseases associated to the IGF system."

https://openalex.org/W2098806000,"The DNA recombination and repair machineries of Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma pneumoniae differ considerably from those of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Most notably, M. pneumoniae is unable to express a functional RecU Holliday junction (HJ) resolvase. In addition, the RuvB homologues from both M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium only exhibit DNA helicase activity but not HJ branch migration activity in vitro. To identify a putative role of the RuvA homologues of these mycoplasmas in DNA recombination, both proteins (RuvAMpn and RuvAMge, respectively) were studied for their ability to bind DNA and to interact with RuvB and RecU. In spite of a high level of sequence conservation between RuvAMpn and RuvAMge (68.8% identity), substantial differences were found between these proteins in their activities. First, RuvAMge was found to preferentially bind to HJs, whereas RuvAMpn displayed similar affinities for both HJs and single-stranded DNA. Second, while RuvAMpn is able to form two distinct complexes with HJs, RuvAMge only produced a single HJ complex. Third, RuvAMge stimulated the DNA helicase and ATPase activities of RuvBMge, whereas RuvAMpn did not augment RuvB activity. Finally, while both RuvAMge and RecUMge efficiently bind to HJs, they did not compete with each other for HJ binding, but formed stable complexes with HJs over a wide protein concentration range. This interaction, however, resulted in inhibition of the HJ resolution activity of RecUMge."

https://openalex.org/W2047473069,"The prototype polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is an environmental pollutant and food contaminant of epidemiological importance. To protect against adverse effects of this ubiquitous carcinogen, we developed an immunoprophylactic strategy based on a B[a]P-protein conjugate vaccine to induce B[a]P specific antibodies (Grova et al., Vaccine. 2009;27:4142-51). Here, we investigated in mice the efficacy of B[a]P-peptide conjugates based on promiscuous T cell epitopes (TCE) into further improve this approach. We showed that B[a]P-peptide conjugates induced very different levels of hapten-specific antibodies with variable functional efficacy, depending on the carrier. In some cases peptide carriers induced a more efficient antibody response against B[a]P than tetanus toxoid as a protein carrier, with the capacity to sequester more B[a]P in the blood. Reducing the carrier size to a single TCE can dramatically shift the antibody bias from the carrier to the B[a]P. Conjugates based on the TCE FIGITEL induced the best anti-hapten response and no antibodies against the carrier peptide. Some peptide conjugates increased the selectivity of the antibodies for the activated metabolite 7,8-diol-B[a]P and B[a]P by one or two orders of magnitude. The antibody efficacy was also demonstrated in their ability to sequester B[a]P in the blood and modulate its faecal excretion (15-56%). We further showed that pre-existing immunity to the carrier from which the TCE was derived did not reduce the immunogenicity of the peptide conjugate. In conclusion, we showed that a vaccination against B[a]P using promiscuous TCEs of tetanus toxin as carriers is feasible even in case of a pre-existing immunity to the toxoid and that some TCE epitopes dramatically redirect the antibody response to the hapten. Further studies to demonstrate a long-term protection of an immunoprophylactic immunisation against B[a]P are warranted."

Mark Ratner sought out biopharma analyst Joseph Schwartz, a managing director at Leerink Swann in Boston, for his views on what’s behind the recent buyout spending. On 17 May, Human Genome Sciences (HGS) formally rejected a $2.6 billion unsolicited takeover offer by GlaxoSmithKline. The Maryland-based biotech firm had long partnered with the UK drug giant to develop drugs including Benlysta (belimumab), HGS's first drug on the market and the first new medicine approved to fight lupus in 50 years. But, at $13 a share, GSK's bid was deemed “inadequate” by the HGS board. Recent history in the biotech sector shows how high the stakes are in such negotiations. Since last November, six biopharma buyouts have exceeded $1 billion each, with Gilead Sciences' purchase last year of the hepatitis C specialist Pharmasset topping the charts at a whopping $11.2 billion, the highest ever paid for a clinical-stage biotech and an 89% premium to its share price at the time. More recently, in April AstraZeneca paid $1.3 billion for Ardea Biosciences, a company with cancer and gout drugs in the pipeline but nothing on the market. One person watching the upward clime of such deals is biopharma analyst Joseph Schwartz, a managing director at Leerink Swann in Boston. Mark Ratner sought out Schwartz, who was named the top stock picker for pharmaceuticals in the last year's FT/StarMine Analyst Awards, for his views on what's behind the recent buyout spending."
