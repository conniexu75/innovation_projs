https://openalex.org/W2074187719,"The proposal that nitric oxide (NO) or its reactant products mediate toxicity in brain remains controversial in part because of the use of nonselective agents that block NO formation in neuronal, glial, and vascular compartments. In mutant mice deficient in neuronal NO synthase (NOS) activity, infarct volumes decreased significantly 24 and 72 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion, and the neurological deficits were less than those in normal mice. This result could not be accounted for by differences in blood flow or vascular anatomy. However, infarct size in the mutant became larger after endothelial NOS inhibition by nitro-L-arginine administration. Hence, neuronal NO production appears to exacerbate acute ischemic injury, whereas vascular NO protects after middle cerebral artery occlusion. The data emphasize the importance of developing selective inhibitors of the neuronal isoform."
https://openalex.org/W2033791403,"As normal cells progress toward malignancy, they must switch to an angiogenic phenotype to attract the nourishing vasculature that they depend on for their growth. In cultured fibroblasts from Li-Fraumeni patients, this switch was found to coincide with loss of the wild-type allele of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and to be the result of reduced expression of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. Transfection assays revealed that p53 can stimulate the endogenous TSP-1 gene and positively regulate TSP-1 promoter sequences. These data indicate that, in fibroblasts, wild-type p53 inhibits angiogenesis through regulation of TSP-1 synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2032304318,"Following nerve injury, axons in the CNS do not normally regenerate. It has been shown that CNS myelin inhibits neurite outgrowth, though the nature of the molecules responsible for this effect are not known. Here, we demonstrate that the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), a transmembrane protein of both CNS and PNS myelin, strongly inhibits neurite outgrowth from both developing cerebellar and adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in vitro. This inhibition is reversed by an anti-MAG antibody. In contrast, MAG promotes neurite outgrowth from newborn DRG neurons. These results suggest that MAG may be responsible, in part, for the lack of CNS nerve regeneration in vivo and may influence, both temporally and spatially, regeneration in the PNS."
https://openalex.org/W1971701163,"In a process called ""molecular combining,"" DNA molecules attached at one end to a solid surface were extended and aligned by a receding air-water interface and left to dry on the surface. Molecular combing was observed to extend the length of the bacteriophage lambda DNA molecule to 21.5 +/- 0.5 micrometers (unextended length, 16.2 micrometers). With the combing process, it was possible to (i) extend a chromosomal Escherichia coli DNA fragment (10(6) base pairs) and (ii) detect a minute quantity of DNA (10(3) molecules). These results open the way for a faster physical mapping of the genome and for the detection of small quantities of target DNA from a population of molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2066789848,"Nucleotide sequence information derived from DNA segments of the human and other genomes is accumulating rapidly. However, it frequently proves difficult to use such short DNA segments to identify clones in genomic libraries or fragments in blots of the whole genome or for in situ analysis of chromosomes. Oligonucleotide probes, consisting of two target-complementary segments, connected by a linker sequence, were designed. Upon recognition of the specific nucleic acid molecule the ends of the probes were joined through the action of a ligase, creating circular DNA molecules catenated to the target sequence. These probes thus provide highly specific detection with minimal background."

https://openalex.org/W2070849620,"We report the isolation of a Xenopus BMP receptor that is expressed maternally in the appropriate location to play a role in mesoderm induction. This receptor binds both BMP-2 and BMP-4 with high affinity. A truncated form of this BMP receptor specifically blocks BMP-4 signaling. Expression of this truncated BMP receptor during embryogenesis converts ventral mesoderm to dorsal mesoderm. Contrary to the popularly held view that ventral is the ground state for all mesoderm, our results suggest that formation of ventral mesoderm requires an active signal and that, in the absence of this ventral signal, dorsal mesoderm is formed."

https://openalex.org/W1987237521,"Mek4 and Sek are tyrosine kinases with expression patterns in the mouse embryo that suggest important functions in early development. However, like all Eph family kinases, both were identified as orphan receptors without known ligands. We show that Mek4 and Sek soluble receptor-alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins can be used in a procedure termed RAP in situ to identify regions of ligand expression in the mouse embryo. Based on this spatial information, a cDNA expression library was prepared, and was screened with the fusion proteins to identify Eph ligand family-1 (ELF-1). In cell lines and embryos, ELF-1 is membrane bound by a phosphatidylinositol tail, a feature that may account for unique biological functions. Its sequence is homologous with B61, a ligand for the Eck kinase, defining a family of related ligands. The expression domains of ELF-1, Mek4 and Sek indicate potential roles in embryonic patterning."
https://openalex.org/W2084179773,"The gene aquaporin-1 encodes channel-forming integral protein (CHIP), a member of a large family of water transporters found throughout nature. Three rare individuals were identified who do not express CHIP-associated Colton blood group antigens and whose red cells exhibit low osmotic water permeabilities. Genomic DNA analyses demonstrated that two individuals were homozygous for different nonsense mutations (exon deletion or frameshift), and the third had a missense mutation encoding a nonfunctioning CHIP molecule. Surprisingly, none of the three suffers any apparent clinical consequence, which raises questions about the physiological importance of CHIP and implies that other mechanisms may compensate for its absence."
https://openalex.org/W2043628792,"Sensory transduction in olfactory neurons is mediated by intracellular cAMP, which directly gates a nonselective cation channel. A cDNA encoding a cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channel subunit (rOCNC1) has been cloned previously from rat olfactory epithelium. However, differences between the functional properties of rOCNC1 and the native olfactory CNG channel suggest that the native channel could be composed of several distinct subunit types. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding a second olfactory CNG channel subunit (rOCNC2) that is 52% identical to rOCNC1 and that is expressed specifically in olfactory sensory neurons. Expression of rOCNC2 alone in Xenopus oocytes does not lead to detectable CNG currents. However, coexpression of rOCNC2 with rOCNC1 results in a CNG conductance that differs from that detected upon expression of rOCNC1 alone and more closely resembles the native conductance in several respects, including its sensitivity to cAMP. This suggests that the native olfactory CNG channel is a hetero-oligomer composed of rOCNC1 and rOCNC2 subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1641373107,"We previously demonstrated that P-selectin binds with high affinity to a trace, homodimeric glycoprotein ligand on human myeloid cells. The ligand carries the sialyl Lewis x (sLe(x)) epitope, a limited number of N-linked glycans, and clustered, sialylated O-linked glycans. In this study we demonstrate that the polypeptide component of this ligand is identical to that of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a molecule recently identified by expression cloning from a human myeloid cell cDNA library. We have examined the effects of glycosidases on purified, radioiodinated PSGL-1 from human neutrophils to further characterize the structure and function of the attached oligosaccharides. We found that PSGL-1 had poly-N-acetyllactosamine, only some of which could be removed with endo-beta-galactosidase. The majority of the Le(x) and sLe(x) structures were on endo-beta-galactosidase-sensitive chains. Peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) treatment removed at least two of the three possible N-linked oligosaccharides from PSGL-1. Expression of Le(x) and sLe(x) was not detectably altered by PNGaseF digestion, indicating that these structures were primarily on O-linked poly-N-acetyllactosamine. Endo-beta-galactosidase-treated PSGL-1 retained the ability to bind to P-selectin, suggesting that some of the oligosaccharides recognized by P-selectin were either on enzyme-resistant poly-N-acetyllactosamine or on chains which lack poly-N-acetyllactosamine. PNGaseF treatment did not affect the ability of PSGL-1 to bind to P-selectin, demonstrating that the oligosaccharides required for P-selectin recognition are O-linked. PSGL-1 also bound to E-selectin, but with at least 50-fold lower affinity than to P-selectin. These data suggest that PSGL-1 from human neutrophils displays complex, sialylated, and fucosylated O-linked poly-N-acetyllactosamine that promote high affinity binding to P-selectin, but not to E-selectin."
https://openalex.org/W1511974550,"Iron-responsive element-binding proteins (IRE-BPs) are cytosolic proteins that bind to a conserved RNA stem-loop, termed the iron-responsive element (IRE), that is located in the 5'- or 3'-untranslated regions of mRNAs involved in iron metabolism. Binding of the IRE-BP to 5'-IREs represses translation, whereas binding to 3'-IREs stabilizes the mRNA. The previously identified IRE-BP (BP1) contains a 4Fe-4S cluster and has sequence homology to mitochondrial aconitase. The 4Fe-4S cluster is important for iron-dependent regulation: BP1 containing iron has low affinity for the IRE and contains aconitase activity, whereas BP1 lacking iron has high affinity for the IRE, but lacks aconitase activity. A second IRE-BP (BP2) has been identified in rat tissues and cells and exhibits many of the hallmarks of an IRE-BP, including binding to the IRE and functioning as a translational repressor of IRE-containing RNAs. BP1 and BP2 RNA binding activities are decreased in extracts from cells treated with iron, indicating that BP1 and BP2 are negatively regulated by iron. Although BP1 and BP2 share similar characteristics, they differ in two significant ways. Unlike BP1 levels, which do not change when RNA binding activity decreases in response to iron, BP2 decreases to undetectable levels in extracts from cells treated with iron; and unlike BP1, BP2 does not have aconitase activity. These data indicate that BP1 and BP2 are distinct proteins that have similar specificity for IRE binding and that function similarly in translation, but are regulated by iron via different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2024275247,"The adult pattern of axonal connections from the eye to the brain arises during development through the refinement of a roughly ordered set of connections. In the chick visual system, refinement normally results in the loss of the ipsilateral retinotectal connections. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis reduced the loss of these transient connections. Because nitric oxide is expressed by tectal cells with which retinal axons connect and because reduction of nitric oxide synthesis by tectal cells resulted in a change in the connections of retinal axons, nitric oxide probably serves as a messenger from tectal cells back to retinal axons during development."
https://openalex.org/W1589063951,"Wortmannin, a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (Okada, T., Sakuma, L., Fukui, Y., Hazeki, O., and Ui, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 3563-3567), prevented Fc receptor for IgG (Fc gamma R)-dependent phagocytosis of the human monocytic cell line U937 or guinea pig neutrophils. Cross-linking of Fc gamma R on the surface of U937 cells increased PI 3-kinase activity that was immunoprecipitated with antibody against phosphotyrosine or antibody against the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. Specific cross-linking of Fc gamma R subclass Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII, using monoclonal antibodies against each receptor subclass and the F(ab')2 fragment of goat antibody against mouse IgG, increased anti-phosphotyrosine-precipitable PI 3-kinase activity. Treatment of cells with anti-Fc gamma RIII antibody plus the same F(ab')2 did not affect the activity, reflecting the lack of Fc gamma RIII in U937 cells. Fcy gamma R stimulation triggered prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, among which the 115-kDa peptide showed strong association with PI 3-kinase. Thus, Fc gamma R appears to be coupled functionally, via a tyrosine kinase, to PI 3-kinase, which may regulate the phagocytotic activity of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1972554093,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is both a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily and a Cl(-)-selective ion channel. We investigated the permeation pathway of human CFTR with measurements on conduction and open-channel blockade by diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC). We used site-directed mutagenesis and oocyte expression to locate residues in transmembrane domain (TM) 6 and TM 12 that contact DPC and control rectification and single-channel conductances. Thus, TM 12 and the previously investigated TM 6 line the CFTR pore. In each TM, residues in contact with DPC are separated by two turns of an alpha helix. The contributions of TM 6 and TM 12 to DPC block and Cl- permeation, however, are not equivalent. The resulting structural model for the conduction pathway may guide future studies of permeation in other Cl- channels and ATP-binding cassette transporters."

https://openalex.org/W2095529674,"The functional consequences of single proton transfers occurring in the pore of a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel were observed with patch recording techniques. These results led to three conclusions about the chemical nature of ion binding sites in the conduction pathway: The channel contains two identical titratable sites, even though there are more than two (probably four) identical subunits; the sites are formed by glutamate residues that have a pKa (where K(a) is the acid constant) of 7.6; and protonation of one site does not perturb the pKa of the other. These properties point to an unusual arrangement of carboxyl side-chain residues in the pore of a cation channel."
https://openalex.org/W1672882868,"Binding of interleukin (IL)-3 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to their high affinity cell surface receptors induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a similar set of protein substrates. We have identified one of these common substrates (p70) as the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHPTP2. The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of the adaptor protein Grb2 bound with high affinity to tyrosine-phosphorylated SHPTP2 following treatment of cells with IL-3 or GM-CSF, but not IL-4. This interaction was inhibited by two phosphotyrosine peptides, based on sequences within SHPTP2, which conform to the postulated consensus sequence for Grb2 SH2 recognition. Following treatment with IL-3 or GM-CSF, but not IL-4, SHPTP2 co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against the p85 subunit of PI 3‘-kinase. This was partially blocked by the same phosphopeptides that blocked Grb2-SH2 binding to SHPTP2. Importantly, treatment with IL-3 resulted in a 2-3-fold increase in SHPTP2 phosphatase activity. These results suggest that SHPTP2 may play an important role in integrating signals from the IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors to both Ras and PI 3‘-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1605821595,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) binds with high affinity to three cell-surface receptors. Both type I and II receptors are transmembrane serine/threonine kinases and thought to mediate TGF-beta responses by forming a heteromeric complex in the presence of TGF-beta. We investigated whether the type II receptors form a homomeric complex in the presence or absence of ligand. Double immunoprecipitation analyses were performed using lysates from metabolically labeled cells cotransfected with differentially epitope-tagged type II receptors. We demonstrate that the type II receptors can form a homomeric complex even in the absence of their ligand, TGF-beta. This pre-existing type II receptor complex has the ability to bind TGF-beta. Moreover, in addition to the extracellular and transmembrane domains, the cytoplasmic portions of the receptors are also able to interact with each other, indicating that multiple contact points are involved in the formation of the homomeric type II receptor complex. Our results suggest a novel mechanism of complex formation and receptor activation of the serine/threonine kinase receptor family."
https://openalex.org/W1509170501,"cDNAs encoding trpE fusion proteins containing fragments of the skeletal muscle Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor) were expressed in bacteria. The fusion proteins, which covered about 90% of the linear sequence of the ryanodine receptor, were used to identify calmodulin- (CaM), Ca(2+)-, and ruthenium red-binding regions in the ryanodine receptor through the use of 125I-CaM, 45Ca2+, and ruthenium red overlay procedures. Six Ca(2+)-dependent CaM-binding domains were detected in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor. Strong CaM-binding domains were localized in regions 6, 11, 12, and 13, in subregions 6b, 11b, and 13b, and in short sequences 6b3, 11b1, and 13b2, lying between amino acid residues 2063 and 2091, 3611 and 3642, and 4303 and 4328. Weaker CaM-binding domains were localized in regions 4, 9, and 10 and in subregions 4b, 9b, and 10a, lying between residues 921 and 1173, 2804 and 2930, and 2961 and 3084. Most of these CaM-binding domains encompassed all or part of previously predicted CaM-binding sites. Strong 45Ca(2+)- and ruthenium red-binding sites domains were localized in the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of the ryanodine receptor and in regions 6, 12, and 13. The 45Ca(2+- and ruthenium red-binding sites in regions 6 and 12 were localized in subregions 6b and 12b, lying between residues 1861-2094 and 3657-3776. These data together with earlier studies (Chen, S. R. W., Zhang, L., and MacLennan, D. H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 23318-23326), show that strong CaM-, Ca(2+)-, and ruthenium red-binding domains are colocalized in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1520028124,"In response to Ca2+ entry, several prominent brain nerve terminal phosphoproteins undergo dephosphorylation, but the relation between dephosphorylation and neurotransmitter release is unknown. Using the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A (CsA) and L-683,590 (FK-520) to inhibit specifically the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin, we demonstrate here that Ca(2+)-dependent dephosphorylation in isolated rat brain nerve terminals (synaptosomes) is mediated by calcineurin. Pretreatment with micromolar CsA resulted in a 76-95% inhibition of stimulation-induced decreases in 32P-labeled dynamin (previously referred to as dephosphin), a phosphoprotein of M(r) = 145,000 (145-kDa protein), and a phosphoprotein of M(r) = 170,000 (170-kDa protein). Pretreatment with FK-520 also inhibited Ca(2+)-dependent dephosphorylation. Using hypotonic lysates of 32P-labeled synaptosomes, the addition of Ca2+ plus calmodulin, but not either agent alone, induced dynamin dephosphorylation. CsA and FK-520 had little to no effect on the release of glutamate induced by either K(+)-depolarization or the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. In contrast, calcineurin inhibition led to a substantial enhancement of glutamate release evoked by the K(+)-channel blocker 4-aminopyridine, an agent whose action most closely mimics physiological stimulation. Calcineurin inhibition had no effect on stimulation-induced changes in synaptosomal Ca2+ levels. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that Ca(2+)-dependent protein dephosphorylation resulting from calcineurin activation during physiological stimulation limits neurotransmitter release from brain nerve terminals, perhaps being dependent upon cyclic repolarization of the membrane during stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1497553313,"During the course of serious bacterial infections, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is believed to interact with macrophage receptors, resulting in the generation of inflammatory mediators and systemic symptoms including hemodynamic instability and shock. CD14, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked antigen, functions as an LPS signaling receptor. A critical issue concerns the mechanism by which CD14, which has no transmembrane domain, transduces its signal following LPS binding. Recently, investigators have hypothesized that CD14-mediated signaling is effected through a receptor-associated tyrosine kinase (TK), suggesting a multicomponent receptor model of LPS signaling. Wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells can be activated by endotoxin to release arachidonate following transfection with human CD14 (CHO/CD14). Nuclear translocation of cytosolic NF-kappa B is correlated with a number of LPS-inducible responses. We sought to determine if this pathway were present in CHO/CD14 cells and to elucidate the relationship of NF-kappa B activation to the CD14 receptor system. LPS-stimulated translocation of NF-kappa B in CHO/CD14 cells resembled the same response in the murine macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7. Protein synthesis inhibitors and corticosteroids, which suppress arachidonate release and the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, had no effect on translocation of NF-kappa B in CHO/CD14 or RAW 264.7 cells, demonstrating that NF-kappa B translocation is an early event. Although TK activity was consistently observed by immunoblotting extracts from activated RAW 264.7 cells, LPS-induced phosphotyrosine residues were not observed from similarly treated CHO/CD14 cells. Furthermore, the TK inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein failed to inhibit translocation of NF-kappa B in CHO/CD14 or RAW 264.7 cells, although both of these agents inhibited LPS-induced TK activity in RAW 264.7 cells. These results imply that TK activity is not obligatory for CD14-mediated signal transduction to occur in response to LPS."
https://openalex.org/W1547327469,"We have established the first homologous cell-free DNA replication system for a papillomavirus. The replication of the human papillomavirus type 11 (HPV-11) origin was achieved by using human 293 cell extracts supplemented with the HPV-11 E1 and E2 proteins purified from insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses. Efficient replication depends on the HPV-11 origin, the HPV-11 E1 and E2 proteins, as well as human DNA polymerase alpha, delta, replication protein A, topoisomerase I, and topoisomerase II. High concentrations of E1 protein also promoted a low level of origin-independent replication which was suppressed by the addition of the E2 protein, whereas E2 protein stimulated origin-dependent replication. We also show that an intact E2 protein binding site was absolutely necessary for origin activity, as a strong HPV-11 origin was rendered inactive when one half-site of each of the three E2 binding sites was mutated. In contrast, there was only a relatively small reduction in this mutant origin activity when the cell extracts were supplemented with the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) proteins. These results suggest that the HPV-11 E2 protein plays a primary role in HPV origin recognition. Furthermore, unlike transient replication in which HPV-11 and BPV-1 viral proteins promote efficient replication of homologous and heterologous origins, efficient cell-free replication took place only with the homologous combinations."
https://openalex.org/W1588352485,"To demonstrate the presence of a soluble isoform of P-selectin predicted from cDNA sequencing (Johnston, G.I., Bliss, G.A., Newman, P.J., and McEver, R.P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21381-21385), we immunoisolated and compared structurally P-selectin from fresh frozen human plasma with that from washed intact platelets. Plasma P-selectin was reactive with rabbit antiserum to a synthesized peptide (residues 762-774 of mature P-selectin) but was significantly less reactive with antibody to a peptide (residues 747-760). In contrast, platelet P-selectin reacted with both antibodies. S-Pyridylethylated plasma P-selectin was fractionated by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography into two major species. From platelets, two virtually identical species were separated. Sequential digestion with Achromobacter protease I and then Staphylococcus V8 protease produced peptides assigned to the tail region of the protein including the putative spliced site. From the more hydrophilic species in both plasma and platelets, a peptide completely lacking the sequence of the putative spliced site was identified. In contrast, the more hydrophobic species yielded a peptide with an intact transmembrane sequence. Hence, these results provide direct evidence that the previously predicted soluble isoform of P-selectin is actually synthesized in vivo and is present as a circulating molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1608138975,"We evaluated in Jurkat T cells the time-dependent responses of Fyn, Lck, Syk, and Zap following antibody-mediated cross-linking of the T cell antigen receptor. Our results show that the protein kinase activities of Fyn and Lck were activated within seconds of receptor cross-linking. Fyn activity, as measured by autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate, was maximal 5 s to 1 min following receptor cross-linking. Lck was also found to be activated within 5 s of antigen receptor cross-linking but differed from Fyn in that Lck activity was elevated for at least 30 min. Syk and Zap protein kinase activities were found to peak between 5 and 10 min following receptor cross-linking, returning to approximately basal activity levels by 60 min. The protein kinase activities of both Syk and Zap were found to parallel their reactivity in immunoblotting experiments with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Both Syk and Zap were found to associate with the tyrosine-phosphorylated zeta subunit of the T cell antigen receptor. These observations imply that T cell antigen receptor signal transduction involves the activation of multiple members of at least two different families of non-transmembrane protein tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2050195656,"In the adult avian forebrain, neurons continue to be produced in the subependymal zone (SZ), from which they migrate upon radial fibers. To identify ligands regulating this process, we studied N-cadherin and Ng-CAM/8D9 expression in HVC, a neurogenic region of the canary neostriatum. N-cadherin was relatively restricted to the SZ and was expressed by dividing, [3H]thymidine-labeled precursor cells. However, cellular N-cadherin was down-regulated prior to neuronal migration from the SZ. Addition of anti-N-cadherin Fab hastened neuronal migration from adult SZ explants, without influencing neuronal number. Unlike N-cadherin, Ng-CAM/8D9 was expressed by migrating neurons. Anti-8D9 Fab inhibited neuronal migration upon cultured ependymoglia, which did not express Ng-CAM/8D9. Thus, the departure of new neurons from the adult SZ may require their suppression of N-cadherin, whereas their subsequent migration and survival may depend upon neuronal expression of Ng-CAM/8D9 and its interaction with a heterophilic radial cell receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1497933126,"Abstract Conformational constraints were imposed on a peptide epitope from Chlamydia trachomatis to improve its ability to elicit antibodies that cross-react with native antigen. Appropriate constraints were discovered by a strategy that required no prior knowledge of the epitope's native conformation. First, we constructed a library of 3.2 x 10(5) peptides in which the epitope's contact residues were subject to random conformational constraints, each constrained peptide being fused genetically to the surface of a filamentous phage vector. Next, we selected phage displaying the most native-like peptides in the library by affinity purification with antibodies that bind the epitope only in its native conformation. Finally, we immunized mice with the selected phage and titered the resulting antisera against both whole cells and unconstrained peptide. The ratio of anti-cell titer to anti-peptide titer, which reflects the channeling of the antibody response to the native epitope, was up to five times higher for affinity-selected phage than for unselected peptide phage. In this case, therefore, the ability of a peptide to bind antibodies specific for native epitope, correlated with its ability to elicit antibodies that are effective against the native antigen on an invading pathogen. If the correlation is general, surveying thousands or millions of peptides for antigenic fitness with phage display technology may be a simple but effective pre-screen for immunogenic fitness, which is costly to assess directly."
https://openalex.org/W1604339302,"We have shown that non-hepatic Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) have a specific inability to translocate and secrete apolipoprotein B (apoB), leading to its complete degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (Thrift, R. N., Drisko, J., Dueland, S., Trawick, J. D., and Davis, R. A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 9161-9165). To gain an understanding why a protein having no predictable trans-membrane sequences can be stably integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum, we determined the topography and metabolic fate of apoB in both CHO cells and human hepatoma cells (HepG2). Using epitope-specific antibodies, we show that in microsomes from both cell types, apoB assumes a trans-membrane orientation having 69 kDa of its N terminus in the lumen and the remaining portion of the C terminus residing on the cytoplasmic surface. In both cell types, proteolytic cleavage of the translocation arrested apoB by a process that can be blocked by acetyl-leucine, leucine, norleucal, produces an 85-kDa N-terminal fragment that resumes translocation and is secreted. This same N-terminal 85-kDa fragment is also found in human plasma. These results show that sequences residing outside of the membrane spanning domain can block translocation. Moreover, our data provide compelling evidence showing that apoB undergoes an unusual transient, translocation arrest, that serves as an entrance into the intracellular degradative pathway regulating its secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1520985931,"Entry of the catalytic domain of diphtheria toxin into the cytoplasma of eukaryotic cells depends on insertion of the T (transmembrane) domain into the endosomal membrane, a process triggered by low pH. To probe the mechanism of insertion, we mutated ionizable residues within the helical hairpin region of the T domain. Only three mutations caused significant effects on cytotoxicity, D295K, E349K, and D352K. Each of these represents a substitution of a basic for an acidic residue at the tip of a helical hairpin. Substitution of Lys for Glu349 or Asp352, in the TH8/9 hairpin, reduced toxicity for Vero cells > 100-fold, whereas a Lys substitution for Asp295, one of 3 acidic residues in the TH5/6/7 hairpin, caused a less marked reduction. All three mutations also altered the pH-dependent formation, and/or ion conductance, of channels formed by the toxin in artificial bilayers or the plasma membrane. E349K or D352K did not alter the pH dependence of conformational changes in the toxin occurring near pH 5. Our findings support the hypothesis that the TH8/9 hairpin inserts into the endosomal membrane after low pH-mediated partial unfolding of the T domain. A positive residue at the tip of this hairpin apparently inhibits insertion and blocks toxin action. The ion-conducting properties of channels formed by selected mutants, described elsewhere, are consistent with this model. The status of the TH5/6/7 hairpin in the integral membrane form of the T domain remains uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W1599767906,"The mechanism of action of different types of interferons (IFN-alpha, -beta, and -gamma) against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection was investigated in chronically infected monocytoid U937 cells and during an acute infection of the T lymphoblastoid CEM cells. Two chronically infected U937 cell populations, obtained independently (referred to as type A and B cells), were analyzed for their response to IFNs. In type A cells, IFNs mainly inhibited virus particle release, whereas in type B cells, the anti-HIV effect of IFNs cells was found to be largely due to a specific inhibition of viral protein synthesis without any apparent effect on total cellular protein synthesis. Interestingly, such a differential inhibition of HIV protein synthesis could also be demonstrated in acutely infected CEM cells in response to treatment with IFN-alpha. Both in chronically infected U937 type B and acutely infected CEM cells, equivalent amounts of nuclear and cytoplasmic HIV-1 mRNA were detected in control and IFN-treated cells in spite of at least 80% inhibition of HIV protein synthesis. Analysis of the distribution of cellular and viral mRNAs on polysomes in HIV-1-infected cells demonstrated that IFN treatment induces a specific block on viral mRNA translation. These results indicate that the antiviral mechanism of IFN on later stages of HIV replication cycle may be partly due to the inhibition of HIV mRNA translation, besides an effect on virus budding or release."
https://openalex.org/W1545429574,"Abstract Pre-steady-state methods were used to study the fidelity of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase. Fidelity of DNA-directed DNA synthesis can be attributed to a 1-2 order of magnitude reduction in affinity for noncomplementary dNTPs, and a 1-4 order of magnitude reduction in the rate of the conformational change that limits the rate of nucleotide addition. Affinities of reverse transcriptase for paired or mispaired primer termini are similar. Discrimination against a mispaired primer is due to reduction in affinity for the next dNTP and reduction in rate of extension. Extension of mispaired termini proceeds 20-700-fold faster than the rate of dissociation of reverse transcriptase from the primer-template and is 2-3 orders of magnitude more frequent than nucleotide misincorporation. The rate-limiting step for extension of a mispaired terminus occurs at the conformational change or chemical step, depending on the nature of the mispair. Presence of a mismatch at the 3' penultimate position reduces pyrophosphorolysis of the primer by a factor of 10(3), indicating that mispairs 5' to the site of chemistry can also affect catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1598300390,"Purified high conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ (maxi-K) channels from bovine tracheal smooth muscle have been covalently labeled employing monoiodotyrosine charybdotoxin ([125I]ChTX) and different bifunctional cross-linking reagents. [125I]ChTX was specifically incorporated into the beta-subunit, which was thereafter isolated by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography. Proteolytic fragments of the [125I]ChTX-labeled beta-subunit were generated by digestion with various endoproteinases. Glu-C or Asp-N cleavage yielded a glycosylated [125I]ChTX-labeled fragment of 13-14 kDa. A site-directed antiserum raised against residues 62-75 of the cloned beta-subunit of the maxi-K channel specifically recognizes the beta-subunit in immunostaining experiments and was capable of immunoprecipitating these ChTX-labeled peptides. Lys-C cleavage resulted in two fragments of 16 and 28 kDa, respectively, which were both precipitated by anti-beta (62-75). However, only the 28-kDa fragment was recognized by anti-beta(118-132) and shown to carry double the amount of N-linked carbohydrates. Taken together, these data restrict the site of covalent incorporation of ChTX into the beta-subunit exclusively at Lys69, confirm the predicted topology of this subunit, and indicate that both canonical N-linked glycosylation sites are occupied with complex carbohydrates of 5-6 kDa each. We propose that an extracellularly located portion of the beta-subunit is located within 7.7 A of the ChTX receptor site and could even participate in the formation of this receptor by close apposition of its extracellular domain with structural elements provided by the alpha-subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1482197609,"Abstract The gene coding for a soluble form of human E-selectin (sE-selectin) has been expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Cells seeded into a hollow fiber reactor secreted protein at a level of 160 mg/liter. The protein was purified to > 95% pure and low endotoxin (< 2 ng/mg), using physiological pH and buffers. The amino acid composition and N-terminal sequence were as predicted from the cDNA sequence. HL-60 cells bound to sE-selectin-coated plates in a dose-dependent manner, and this binding could be blocked up to 100% by pretreatment of HL60 cells with sE-selectin. The concentration of sE-selectin required for 50% inhibition was 1 microM. This value puts an upper limit for the affinity of E-selectin for its natural receptor. sE-selectin also inhibited inflammatory migration of neutrophils in a selective fashion. Purified sE-selectin exhibited a broad band of M(r) approximately 75,000 on nonreducing SDS-PAGE. sE-selectin eluted with M(r) approximately 310,000 from size exclusion chromatography at physiological pH and buffers, suggesting an oligomeric state. Matrix-assisted laser-desorption MS gave a molecular weight of 80,000, while the minimum monomer molecular weight from the gene sequence should be 58,571, demonstrating that the monomeric molecule thus expressed had 27% carbohydrate. Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation gave an average solution molecular weight of 81,600 (+/- 4,500). Velocity ultracentrifugation gave a sedimentation coefficient of 4.3 S and, from this, an apparent axial ratio of 10.5:1, assuming a prolate ellipsoid of revolution. An analysis of the NMR NOESY spectra of sE-selectin, sialyl-Lewis X, and sE-selectin with sialyl-Lewis X demonstrates that the recombinant protein binds sialyl-Lewis X productively. Hence, in solution, sE-selectin is a functional elongated monomer."
https://openalex.org/W1492554871,"The periplasmic histidine-binding protein, HisJ, and the lysine-, arginine-, ornithine-binding protein (LAO) are receptors for histidine transport via the histidine permease of Salmonella typhimurium. The receptors have similar structures, being composed of two lobes held together by two peptide segments, with the ligand-binding site located in a cleft between the lobes. The two lobes are far apart in the unliganded structure (open conformation) and are drawn close together in the liganded structure (closed conformation). The tight binding of the ligand via protein side chains as well as the peptide backbone from both lobes stabilizes the closed conformation (Oh, B.-H., Pandit, J., Kang, C.-H., Nikaido, K., Gokcen, S., Ames, G. F.-L., and Kim, S.-H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 11348-11353; Oh, B.-H., Kang, C.-H., De Bondt, H., Kim, S.-H., Nikaido, K., Joshi, A., and Ames, G. F.-L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 4135-4143). In this study two conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that trap the protein in the closed empty form have been characterized and used to provide evidence that HisJ can assume the closed empty form in the absence of ligand. Several pieces of evidence were provided to demonstrate that these mAbs are specific for HisJ in the closed form. Histidine improves the interaction of these mAbs with immobilized HisJ. The mAbs inhibit both the exchange and the dissociation of histidine from HisJ, indicating that they are able to trap the protein in the closed liganded form. The characterization of the epitopes of the conformation-specific mAbs shows that they include residues that are located in both lobes and that are far apart in the open form but close to each other in the closed form, so that the mAbs must be sensitive to their spatial orientation. Two mAbs that are not conformation-specific according to these criteria were also identified."
https://openalex.org/W1575594603,"The upstream stimulatory factor (USF) is a helix-loop-helix transcription factor that interacts with specific sites on the DNA that are also recognized by the MYC oncoproteins. We isolated genomic clones to the murine 44-kDa form of USF (USF2 gene). This unique gene spans 13 kilobases of DNA and is composed of 10 exons. The gene seems to have maintained its archaic structure, since many of the exons encode discrete functional domains of the transcription factor originally identified by protein sequence comparisons. A particularly striking HpaII tiny fragment island, extending over nearly 2,000 base pairs, surrounds the USF2 translation initiation site. This region, which includes the USF2 promoter and the first four exons, is characterized by an overall GC content greater than 74%. Analysis by S1 mapping and transient transfection assays revealed that the USF2 transcripts originate from an initiator element located within a highly GC-rich region that is surrounded by two long polyadenylate stretches and functions as a bidirectional promoter. Different forms of USF2 messages result from the presence or absence of the fourth exon in the processed USF2 mRNA. Alternative splicing correlates with the lack of a consensus lariat branch point in the third intron. Transient cotransfection assays revealed that the presence or absence of the amino acid sequences encoded by exon 4 affects considerably the transcription activation properties of the USF2 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1521040988,"We have recently reported that v-Raf forms a native heterocomplex with rat heat shock protein (hsp) 90 and a 50-kDa phosphoprotein (p50) in stably transfected 3Y1 fibroblasts (Stancato, L. F., Chow, Y-H., Hutchison, K. A., Perdew, G. H., Jove, R., and Pratt, W. B. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 21711-21716). Several members of the nuclear receptor family exist in heterocomplexes containing hsp90 and various members of the immunophilin protein family, including hsp56, an immunophilin of the FK506 binding class (Pratt, W. B. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 21455-21458). In this work, we have asked if Raf is also associated with an immunophilin. We have immunoadsorbed v-Raf from stably transfected rat 3Y1 fibroblasts and show that the immunoadsorbed v-Raf.hsp90.p50 heterocomplex binds the immunosuppressant drug [3H]FK506. The binding is of high affinity (KD 82 nM) and specific in the sense that it is competed by nonradioactive FK506 and rapamycin but not by cyclosporin A. The [3H]FK506 binding activity is eliminated when the heterocomplex proteins are dissociated from v-Raf. Using the 22W mutant of c-Raf in which the NH2-terminal half has been deleted, we show that the catalytic domain of the kinase is sufficient for the immunophilin association. We have shown that hsp90 and p50 do not bind FK506, and the v-Raf heterocomplex does not contain any of the established FK506-binding proteins. Thus, we propose that Raf is associated with a novel immunophilin."
https://openalex.org/W1543221202,"The formation of tri- and tetraantennary complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides in animal glycoproteins is partly regulated by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:beta-6-D-mannoside beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.155) (GlcNAc-T V), which generates 2,6-branched mannose. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells we found that 2,6-branched mannosyl structures are preferentially contained on lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMPs) and are generally low or absent in other cellular glycoproteins (Do, K.-Y. and Cummings, R.D. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22028-22035). To determine the mechanism by which GlcNAc-T V appears to preferentially recognize glycoproteins, we examined the activity of purified GlcNAc-T V toward a variety of glycoprotein acceptors. Because GlcNAc-T V requires as acceptors oligosaccharides lacking outer galactosyl and sialyl residues, we utilized two classes of acceptor preparations. The first class of acceptor was enzymatically desialylated (DS) and degalactosylated (DG) preparations of bovine fetuin, human transferrin, and human fibrinogen. The second class was glycoproteins in extracts of the mutant CHO cell line, Lec8 CHO, which cannot add galactose or sialic acid to N-linked oligosaccharides. GlcNAc-T V was highly active toward DSDG-fetuin, -transferrin, and -fibrinogen (Km values ranged between 30 and 74 microM), and the catalytic efficiencies (Vmax/Km) of the enzyme toward different acceptors were comparable. In the case of fetuin, each of its three sites for attachment of N-linked oligosaccharides were shown to be utilized equally well by GlcNAc-T V. Notably, the enzyme exhibited a 2-3-fold higher rate of transfer toward DSDG-transferrin when it was further denatured by reduction and S-carboxymethylation. When extracts of Lec8 CHO cells were used as acceptors, GlcNAc-T V preferentially transferred to LAMPs, and only low level transfer was observed to other cell-derived glycoproteins, thus demonstrating specificity of GlcNAc-T V toward native glycoprotein acceptors. When the cell-derived glycoproteins were denatured by reduction and S-carboxymethylation prior to use as acceptors for Glc-NAc-T V, significant transfer occurred to other glycoproteins. These results demonstrate that the mechanism of glycoprotein-specific branching by GlcNAc-T V is determined primarily by its accessibility to available bi/triantennary oligosaccharides on glycoproteins and not by its recognition of peptide determinants or conformation-specific determinants."
https://openalex.org/W1560015232,"Abstract High level expression of the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene is controlled by three upstream enhancers which function even in hepatic cell lines that repress the AFP gene promoter. The most distal (Complex 3, at -6 kilobases) is the strongest in HepG2 cells. We mapped the main activity of Complex 3 to a 170-base pair (BP) region from -6069 to -5900; progressive deletion of the 5'- and 3'-ends identified an 84-bp segment which accounted for 90% of enhancer activity. Expression studies, which combined the deleted Complex 3 with an AFP or tk promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene fusion, resolved five regions in the enhancer (Ia, Ib, II, III, and IV). Deletion of Regions Ia or II strongly reduced stimulation of the AFP promoter, while Regions Ia and Ib were essential for stimulation of the tk promoter. Footprinting indicated multiple binding sites in regions Ia, Ib, and II. Gel shift and oligonucleotide competition demonstrated that Regions Ia and II had high affinity HNF3- and C/EBP-binding sites, respectively, while additional unidentified factors bound throughout Regions I-III. Complex 3 is a powerful liver-specific transcriptional regulator and an important model of long distance gene activation."
https://openalex.org/W1562111079,"A panel of monoclonal antibodies to human vitronectin was used to define some epitopes for the multifunctions of this protein. Separate antibodies were identified which strongly inhibited cell spreading activity and which prevented binding to collagen. A third group interfered with the ability of vitronectin to inhibit complement-mediated guinea pig erythrocyte reactive lysis. None of the antibodies from these three groups prevented heparin binding, providing evidence that this reaction occurs at a fourth location; a different monoclonal antibody partially inhibited the binding of heparin. The relative accessibility of each biologically active epitope was assessed by the differential binding of the monoclonals to native and denatured vitronectin. Reactivity of the antibody which inhibited heparin binding greatly increased upon denaturation of vitronectin, implying that this region is normally inaccessible in the native form of the molecule. By contrast, epitopes for cell spreading, collagen binding, and inhibition of terminal complement complex lysis were destroyed by denaturation. On the basis of denaturation data and epitope mapping by competitive exclusion of monoclonal antibodies, a Venn diagram was constructed to represent overlap of monoclonal antibody epitopes in the tertiary structure. Linear epitopes for the antibodies were identified using cyanogen bromide and plasmin-derived peptides from vitronectin. The antibody which strongly inhibited cell binding reacted with a region containing the RGD site, whereas linear epitopes for collagen binding and complement inhibition appeared to reside in a 43-kDa peptide representing the internal region of the amino acid sequence, excluding the heparin-binding site. The latter two epitopes were differentiated from each other by reactivity of the antibody which inhibited collagen binding toward a smaller 20-kDa plasmin-derived peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1559103329,"The amino-terminal domain of the cytokine receptor homologous region (BN domain; roughly 100 amino acid residues) in the receptor for murine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was secreted as a maltose-binding protein fusion into the Escherichia coli periplasm. The murine BN domain (mBN) was prepared from the fusion protein by restriction protease Factor Xa digestion and purified to homogeneity. The purified BN domain specifically and stoichiometrically bound G-CSF, with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 3-8 x 10(-8) M. The CD spectrum of the mBN domain was similar to that of the extracellular region of the human growth hormone (GH) receptor, which is composed of turns and beta-sheets held together by disulfide bonds. Tertiary folding and the beta-sheet of this small domain was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. Disulfide bonds determined by peptide mapping were in the following locations: Cys107-Cys118, Cys153-Cys162, and Cys143-Cys194. Among them, the first and the second produce small loops (roughly 10 amino acid residues) as found in the human GH receptor. These results suggested that the mBN domain of the G-CSF receptor expressed by E. coli has a GH receptor-like structure. However, the third disulfide bond varied considerably between the G-CSF and GH receptors. Disruption of these disulfide bonds in the BN domain of the G-CSF receptor suggested that all of them are critical for maintaining a stably folded protein. Our results will facilitate understanding of the biophysical and structural properties of this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1549266419,"Accumulating data show that the catalytic function of the Src-related tyrosine protein kinase p56lck is repressed by phosphorylation of a conserved carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue (tyrosine 505). However, previous findings (Abraham, N., Miceli M.C., Parnes, J.R., and Veillette, A. (1991) Nature 350, 62-66) suggest that mechanisms unrelated to tyrosine 505 phosphorylation repress the catalytic function of p56lck in resting T-cells. In keeping with this view, we report herein that the Src homology 3 (SH3) and SH2 domains negatively regulate the catalytic activity of p56lck, by a process independent of carboxyl-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation. While the exact mechanism of this inhibition are not established, its structural requirements in the SH2 domain are distinct from those allowing recruitment of Lck in T-cell receptor signaling. In addition, we obtained evidence that the elevated tyrosine protein phosphatase activity present in T-cells also contributes to inhibit the enzymatic function of p56lck. Such an effect is seemingly mediated by dephosphorylation of tyrosine 394, the site of positive regulation of p56lck. Collectively, these results indicate that the catalytic function of p56lck in resting T-cells is repressed by a complex set of processes, which involves both intramolecular and extramolecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1508991326,"Anti-c-Src and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTP alpha)-transfected and control rat embryo fibroblasts contain a 39-kDa phosphoprotein (p39) whose phosphorylation is enhanced by PTP alpha expression. The p39 that co-immunoprecipitates with c-Src has been identified as c-Jun by immunological and functional criteria; it is recognized by several different anti-c-Jun antibodies and binds to a c-Jun recognition element-containing oligonucleotide. Whereas the association of c-Src and c-Jun is unexpected, it may be of significance in PTP alpha signaling since we have previously demonstrated that c-Src is activated by PTP alpha (Zheng, X. M., Wang, Y., and Pallen, C. J. (1992) Nature 359, 336-339. Examination of c-Jun activity in these fibroblasts demonstrates that c-Jun DNA binding activity and c-Jun-mediated transcription of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene are elevated in PTP alpha-expressing cells. In addition to c-Jun activation, mitogen-activated protein kinase is activated in PTP alpha-expressing cells and translocated to the nuclei of these cells. The nuclear localization of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun suggests that their activation represents downstream events in the receptor-like PTP alpha-initiated signaling pathway(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1756139177,"M and N blood group antigens are presented by glycophorins A (GPA) and B (GPB) of the erythrocyte membrane. GPA expresses M or N blood group antigen depending on the allelic gene (GPAM gene or GPAN gene), while GPB expresses only the N antigen. M or N blood group antigen is specified by the first and fifth NH2-terminal amino acid residues in the mature proteins, encoded by the second exon of these genes. Glycophorin E (GPE) gene, another member of this gene family, has a genomic structure very similar to that of GPB. However, a predicted product of GPE gene carries M blood group antigen. To delineate evolutionary events leading to the formation of the sequences for M or N blood group type determinant in the members of human glycophorin gene family, the nucleotide sequences of a 1.45-kilobase pair region including the 3' part of intron 1, exon 2, and the entire intron 2 were compared for GPAM, GPAN, GPB, and GPE genes. Encompassing exon 2, there were identical sequences stretches of 139 and 138 base pairs between GPAM and GPE genes and between GPAN and GPB genes, respectively. The data of the entire sequences in this region revealed that the divergence of the sequence between GPE and GPA genes (2.14-2.49%) is less than that of the sequence between GPE and GPB genes (3.10%). The higher rate of divergence in this region was observed between GPA and GPB genes (3.79-3.86%). These results strongly suggest that GPE gene acquired the sequence for M blood group type determinant from GPAM gene through gene conversion after duplication of a progenitor gene common to GPB and GPE genes."
https://openalex.org/W1640288378,"We previously reported that activated platelets stimulated neutrophils and monocytes to produce superoxide anion (O2-) through the interaction between P-selectin and its carbohydrate ligand, sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) (Nagata, K., Tsuji, T., Todoroki, N., Katagiri, Y., Tanoue, K., Yamazaki, H., Hanai N., and Irimura, T. (1993) J. Immunol. 151, 3267-3273). In the present study, we investigated the role of cell surface carbohydrate chains of leukocytes in this process. Glycoconjugate-specific hydrolytic enzymes and inhibitors of glycosylation processing were applied. Granulocyte-like differentiated HL-60 (gHL-60) cells released an increased amount of O2- in response to activated platelets in a P-selectin-dependent manner. When HL-60 cells were differentiated in the presence of benzyl-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminide (Bzl-alpha-GalNAc), an inhibitor of chain elongation of O-linked carbohydrates, the enhanced generation of O2- was abrogated in parallel with decrease in the expression of sLex structure and in the adhesion capacity to activated platelets. In contrast, treatment with swainsonine or 1-deoxymannojirimycin, inhibitors of processing of N-linked carbohydrate chains, did not show such effects. O-Sialoglycoprotease treatment of gHL-60 cells decreased the activated platelet-induced O2- production with concomitant reduction of cell surface sLex expression. Treatment of these cells with N-glycanase did not affect the O2- production. These results strongly suggested that serine/threonine-linked carbohydrate chains containing sLex played an essential role in the P-selectin-mediated leukocyte activation. By Western blotting analysis of gHL-60 cell lysates, we identified two glycoproteins which carried sLex structures and were sensitive to Bzl-alpha-GalNAc treatment."

The antibodies are classified into three groups based on their epitopic assignments. Group 1, mAb 123C2, maps in the N terminus of alpha between amino acids 1 and 23; Group 2 antibodies (mAb 129C4, mAb 124D1 and mAb 121C5) map in the central region between amino acids 190 and 210; Group 3 antibodies (mAb 130B1 and mAb 125C6) map in the C terminus between amino acids 310 and 320. mAb 130C2 is anomalous since it maps to the N terminus between amino acids 1 and 23 as well as to the C terminus between amino acids 320 and 329. The antibodies were used to investigate the role of alpha in transcription activation with cAMP receptor protein-dependent promoters. Three antibodies (130C2, 121C5, and 125C6) inhibited cAMP receptor protein-dependent initiation with lac P+ but not with lac UV5 or gal P+. Inhibition was observed with free RNA polymerase and the closed promoter complex; the preformed open promoter complex was insensitive. Only lac P+ was sensitive to these anti-alpha antibodies supporting the concept that the mode of interaction of RNA polymerase with cAMP receptor protein differs between lac P+ and gal P+."
https://openalex.org/W1586780383,"Active site structure-function analyses of anti-fluorescein single chain antibody 4-4-20 and anti-single-stranded DNA single chain antibody 04-01 were conducted studying the ligand binding properties of hybrid antibodies resulting from systematic transplantation of heavy chain complementarity regions (HCDRs) from monoclonal antibody 4-4-20 into 04-01. Two prototype monoclonal antibodies were chosen because the primary structures of their respective light chains were nearly identical but the specificities and shape of their active sites were distinctly different. Based on nearly identical light chains, the diverse active site conformations (i.e. 4-4-20 pocket and 04-01 cleft) and subsequent specificities of the two antibodies were likely dictated by heavy chain properties. As a result, specificities of each HCDR transplant were analyzed in terms of binding reactivity with either fluorescein or (dT)8. Results of binding studies, together with idiotypic and secondary structure analyses, were used to determine the relative contribution of each HCDR to the active site conformations and ligand specificities of monoclonal antibodies 4-4-20 and 04-01. Collectively the various analyses led to the conclusion that the intradomain conformational dynamics and cooperativity necessary for the structural integrity of the low affinity cleft-shaped 04-01 anti-single-stranded DNA active site are probably less stringent than those of a high affinity pocket-shaped anti-fluorescein active site."
