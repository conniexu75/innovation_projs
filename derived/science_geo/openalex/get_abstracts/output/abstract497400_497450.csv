https://openalex.org/W2151241623,"Therapeutic food interventions have reduced mortality in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), but incomplete restoration of healthy growth remains a major problem. The relationships between the type of nutritional intervention, the gut microbiota, and therapeutic responses are unclear. In the current study, bacterial species whose proportional representation define a healthy gut microbiota as it assembles during the first two postnatal years were identified by applying a machine-learning-based approach to 16S ribosomal RNA data sets generated from monthly faecal samples obtained from birth onwards in a cohort of children living in an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh, who exhibited consistently healthy growth. These age-discriminatory bacterial species were incorporated into a model that computes a 'relative microbiota maturity index' and 'microbiota-for-age Z-score' that compare postnatal assembly (defined here as maturation) of a child's faecal microbiota relative to healthy children of similar chronologic age. The model was applied to twins and triplets (to test for associations of these indices with genetic and environmental factors, including diarrhoea), children with SAM enrolled in a randomized trial of two food interventions, and children with moderate acute malnutrition. Our results indicate that SAM is associated with significant relative microbiota immaturity that is only partially ameliorated following two widely used nutritional interventions. Immaturity is also evident in less severe forms of malnutrition and correlates with anthropometric measurements. Microbiota maturity indices provide a microbial measure of human postnatal development, a way of classifying malnourished states, and a parameter for judging therapeutic efficacy. More prolonged interventions with existing or new therapeutic foods and/or addition of gut microbes may be needed to achieve enduring repair of gut microbiota immaturity in childhood malnutrition and improve clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1982864908,"A rodent study using optogenetics to induce long-term potentiation and long-term depression provides a causal link between synaptic plasticity and memory. It has long been thought that the neural mechanisms underlying memories involve synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), but demonstrating a causal link between these synaptic processes and memory has been difficult. Now, Roberto Malinow and colleagues claim to have done just that in mice undergoing fear conditioning. The authors use optogenetics to isolate a specific fear memory circuit and then induce LTD or LTP within the circuit to remove or reinstate the memory. It has been proposed that memories are encoded by modification of synaptic strengths through cellular mechanisms such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD)1. However, the causal link between these synaptic processes and memory has been difficult to demonstrate2. Here we show that fear conditioning3,4,5,6,7,8, a type of associative memory, can be inactivated and reactivated by LTD and LTP, respectively. We began by conditioning an animal to associate a foot shock with optogenetic stimulation of auditory inputs targeting the amygdala, a brain region known to be essential for fear conditioning3,4,5,6,7,8. Subsequent optogenetic delivery of LTD conditioning to the auditory input inactivates memory of the shock. Then subsequent optogenetic delivery of LTP conditioning to the auditory input reactivates memory of the shock. Thus, we have engineered inactivation and reactivation of a memory using LTD and LTP, supporting a causal link between these synaptic processes and memory."

https://openalex.org/W2087980949,"Many extensions of the standard model of particle physics suggest that neutrinos should be Majorana-type fermions—that is, that neutrinos are their own anti-particles—but this assumption is difficult to confirm. Observation of neutrinoless double-β decay (0νββ), a spontaneous transition that may occur in several candidate nuclei, would verify the Majorana nature of the neutrino and constrain the absolute scale of the neutrino mass spectrum. Recent searches carried out with 76Ge (the GERDA experiment) and 136Xe (the KamLAND-Zen and EXO (Enriched Xenon Observatory)-200 experiments) have established the lifetime of this decay to be longer than 1025 years, corresponding to a limit on the neutrino mass of 0.2–0.4 electronvolts. Here we report new results from EXO-200 based on a large 136Xe exposure that represents an almost fourfold increase from our earlier published data sets. We have improved the detector resolution and revised the data analysis. The half-life sensitivity we obtain is 1.9 × 1025 years, an improvement by a factor of 2.7 on previous EXO-200 results. We find no statistically significant evidence for 0νββ decay and set a half-life limit of 1.1 × 1025 years at the 90 per cent confidence level. The high sensitivity holds promise for further running of the EXO-200 detector and future 0νββ decay searches with an improved Xe-based experiment, nEXO."
https://openalex.org/W2160358010,"The protein Keap1 is central to the regulation of the Nrf2-mediated cytoprotective response, and is increasingly recognized as an important target for therapeutic intervention in a range of diseases involving excessive oxidative stress and inflammation. The BTB domain of Keap1 plays key roles in sensing environmental electrophiles and in mediating interactions with the Cul3/Rbx1 E3 ubiquitin ligase system, and is believed to be the target for several small molecule covalent activators of the Nrf2 pathway. However, despite structural information being available for several BTB domains from related proteins, there have been no reported crystal structures of Keap1 BTB, and this has precluded a detailed understanding of its mechanism of action and interaction with antagonists. We report here the first structure of the BTB domain of Keap1, which is thought to contain the key cysteine residue responsible for interaction with electrophiles, as well as structures of the covalent complex with the antagonist CDDO/bardoxolone, and of the constitutively inactive C151W BTB mutant. In addition to providing the first structural confirmation of antagonist binding to Keap1 BTB, we also present biochemical evidence that adduction of Cys 151 by CDDO is capable of inhibiting the binding of Cul3 to Keap1, and discuss how this class of compound might exert Nrf2 activation through disruption of the BTB-Cul3 interface."
https://openalex.org/W1969812030,"Intracranial germ cell tumours are rare tumours affecting mainly male adolescents, mainly in Asia; here the authors identify frequent mutations in the KIT/RAS and AKT/mTOR signalling pathways as well as rare germline variants in JMJD1C, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies focusing on the inhibition of KIT/RAS activation and the AKT1/mTOR pathway. Relatively little is known about intracranial germ cell tumours (IGCTs) — rare tumours affecting principally male adolescents and mainly in Asia. Using exome sequencing, deep-targeted sequencing and SNP array the authors examined 62 IGCT patients and identified frequent mutations in the KIT/RAS and AKT/mTOR signalling pathways as well as rare germline variants in JMJD1C, a histone demethylase and coactivator of the androgen receptor. This study suggests potential therapeutic strategies focusing on the inhibition of KIT/RAS activation and the AKT1/mTOR pathway. Intracranial germ cell tumours (IGCTs) are a group of rare heterogeneous brain tumours that are clinically and histologically similar to the more common gonadal GCTs. IGCTs show great variation in their geographical and gender distribution, histological composition and treatment outcomes. The incidence of IGCTs is historically five- to eightfold greater in Japan and other East Asian countries than in Western countries1, with peak incidence near the time of puberty2. About half of the tumours are located in the pineal region. The male-to-female incidence ratio is approximately 3–4:1 overall, but is even higher for tumours located in the pineal region3. Owing to the scarcity of tumour specimens available for research, little is currently known about this rare disease. Here we report the analysis of 62 cases by next-generation sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism array and expression array. We find the KIT/RAS signalling pathway frequently mutated in more than 50% of IGCTs, including novel recurrent somatic mutations in KIT, its downstream mediators KRAS and NRAS, and its negative regulator CBL. Novel somatic alterations in the AKT/mTOR pathway included copy number gains of the AKT1 locus at 14q32.33 in 19% of patients, with corresponding upregulation of AKT1 expression. We identified loss-of-function mutations in BCORL1, a transcriptional co-repressor and tumour suppressor. We report significant enrichment of novel and rare germline variants in JMJD1C, which codes for a histone demethylase and is a coactivator of the androgen receptor, among Japanese IGCT patients. This study establishes a molecular foundation for understanding the biology of IGCTs and suggests potentially promising therapeutic strategies focusing on the inhibition of KIT/RAS activation and the AKT1/mTOR pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2022549989,"Pik-h, an allele of Pik, confers resistance against the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Its positional cloning has shown that it comprises a pair of NBS-LRR genes, Pikh-1 and Pikh-2. While Pikh-1 appears to be constitutively transcribed, the transcript abundance of Pikh-2 responds to pathogen challenge. The Pikh-1 CC (coiled coil) domain interacts directly with both AvrPik-h and Pikh-2. Transient expression assays demonstrated that Pikh-2 mediates the initiation of the host defence response. Nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of both Pikh-1 and Pikh-2 is required for their functionalities. In a proposed mechanistic model of Pik-h resistance, it is suggested that Pikh-1 acts as an adaptor between AvrPik-h and Pikh-2, while Pikh-2 transduces the signal to trigger Pik-h-specific resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2031205269,"Srs2 helicase is known to dismantle nucleofilaments of Rad51 recombinase to prevent spurious recombination events and unwind trinucleotide sequences that are prone to hairpin formation. Here we document a new, unexpected genome maintenance role of Srs2 in the suppression of mutations arising from mis-insertion of ribonucleoside monophosphates during DNA replication. In cells lacking RNase H2, Srs2 unwinds DNA from the 5' side of a nick generated by DNA topoisomerase I at a ribonucleoside monophosphate residue. In addition, Srs2 interacts with and enhances the activity of the nuclease Exo1, to generate a DNA gap in preparation for repair. Srs2-Exo1 thus functions in a new pathway of nick processing-gap filling that mediates tolerance of ribonucleoside monophosphates in the genome. Our results have implications for understanding the basis of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, which stems from inactivation of the human RNase H2 complex."
https://openalex.org/W2074636474,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the world. The role of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) in specific cell and tissue types has been identified. However, its biological roles in the development of gastric cancer remain largely unexplored. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot were used to analyze the expression of HDAC4 in the clinical samples. siRNA and overexpression of HDAC4 and siRNA p21 were used to study functional effects in a proliferation, a colony formation, a adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) assay and reactive oxygen species(ROS) generation, cell cycle, cell apoptosis rates, and autophagy assays. HDAC4 was up-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and several gastric cancer cell lines. The proliferation, colony formation ability and ATP level were enhanced in HDAC4 overexpression SGC-7901 cells, but inhibited in HDAC4 knockdown SGC-7901 cells. HDAC4 knockdown led to G0/G1 phase cell arrest and caused apoptosis and ROS increase. Moreover, HDAC4 was found to inhibit p21 expression in gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells. p21 knockdown dramatically attenuated cell proliferation inhibition, cell cycle arrest, cell apoptosis promotion and autophagy up-regulation in HDAC4-siRNA SGC-7901 cells. We demonstrated that HDAC4 promotes gastric cancer cell progression mediated through the repression of p21. Our results provide an experimental basis for understanding the pro-tumor mechanism of HDAC4 as treatment for gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2037578345,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly diverse group that is associated with an aggressive phenotype. Its treatment has been challenging due to its heterogeneity and absence of well-defined molecular targets. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel agents with therapeutic application. NF-κB is over-expressed in many breast cancers; thus, inactivation of the NF-κB pathway could serve as a therapeutic target. Here we report for the first time the anti-tumor activity of panepoxydone (PP), a NF-κB inhibitor isolated from an edible mushroom, in several breast cancer cell lines.We investigated the effects of PP on cell growth, migration-invasion, apoptosis and EMT-related proteins expression in MCF-7 and TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453.Significant antitumor activity was seen in all cell lines, with differential responses noted in cell-line specific manner. Treatment with PP resulted in significant cytotoxicity, decreased invasion, migration and increased apoptosis in all cell lines tested. Up-regulation of Bax and cleaved PARP and down-regulation of Bcl-2, survivin, cyclin D1 and caspase 3 were noted in PP-treated breast cancer cells. The antitumor effect of PP appeared related to its ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) with cytoplasmic accumulation. PP treatment also down-regulated FOXM1 which resulted in a reversal of EMT. Similar results were obtained after silencing of NF-kB and FOXM1.Altogether, these studies show, for the first time the antitumor activity of PP against breast cancer cells, in particular TNBC cells. Furthermore, it highlights the concept that optimal treatment of TNBC warrants attention to the differential sensitivity of various TNBC subtypes to therapeutic agents. These results suggest that the PP may be a potentially effective chemopreventive or therapeutic agent against breast cancer. However, additional studies are required to more fully elucidate the mechanism of antitumor effect of PP."
https://openalex.org/W2001110287,"Previous research has identified modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older adults. Research is limited on the potential link between these risk factors and subjective memory impairment (SMI), which may precede AD and other dementias. Examination of these potential relationships may help identify those at risk for AD at a stage when interventions may delay or prevent further memory problems. The objective of this study was to determine whether risk factors for AD are associated with SMI among different age groups.Trained interviewers conducted daily telephone surveys (Gallup-Healthways) of a representative community sample of 18,614 U.S. respondents, including 4,425 younger (age 18 to 39 years), 6,365 middle-aged (40 to 59 years), and 7,824 older (60 to 99 years) adults. The surveyors collected data on demographics, lifestyles, and medical information. Less education, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, less exercise, obesity and depression, and interactions among them, were examined for associations with SMI. Weighted logistic regressions and chi-square tests were used to calculate odds ratios and confidence intervals for SMI with each risk factor and pairwise interactions across age groups.Depression, less education, less exercise, and hypertension were significantly associated with SMI in all three age groups. Several interactions between risk factors were significant in younger and middle-aged adults and influenced their associations with SMI. Frequency of SMI increased with age and number of risk factors. Odds of having SMI increased significantly with just having one risk factor.These results indicate that modifiable risk factors for AD are also associated with SMI, suggesting that these relationships occur in a broad range of ages and may be targeted to mitigate further memory problems. Whether modifying these risk factors reduces SMI and the eventual incidence of AD and other dementias later in life remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1967755900,"Insecticides have a variety of commercial applications including urban pest control, agricultural use to increase crop yields, and prevention of proliferation of insect-borne diseases. Many pesticides in current use are synthetic molecules such as organochlorine and organophosphate compounds. Some synthetic insecticides suffer drawbacks including high production costs, concern over environmental sustainability, harmful effects on human health, targeting non-intended insect species, and the evolution of resistance among insect populations. Thus, there is a large worldwide need and demand for environmentally safe and effective insecticides. Here we show that Erythritol, a non-nutritive sugar alcohol, was toxic to the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Ingested erythritol decreased fruit fly longevity in a dose-dependent manner, and erythritol was ingested by flies that had free access to control (sucrose) foods in choice and CAFE studies. Erythritol was US FDA approved in 2001 and is used as a food additive in the United States. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that erythritol may be used as a novel, environmentally sustainable and human safe approach for insect pest control."

Accordingly, there is substantial interest in understanding factors that affect sensitivity to these agents. In the present study we observed that the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors olaparib and veliparib sensitize the myeloid leukemia cell lines ML-1 and K562, the ovarian cancer line PEO1, non-small cell lung cancer line A549, and a majority of clinical AML isolates, but not normal marrow, to TRAIL. Further analysis demonstrated that PARP inhibitor treatment results in activation of the FAS and TNFRSF10B (death receptor 5 (DR5)) promoters, increased Fas and DR5 mRNA, and elevated cell surface expression of these receptors in sensitized cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated enhanced binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to the TNFRSF10B promoter in the presence of PARP inhibitor. Knockdown of PARP1 or PARP2 (but not PARP3 and PARP4) not only increased expression of Fas and DR5 at the mRNA and protein level, but also recapitulated the sensitizing effects of the PARP inhibition. Conversely, Sp1 knockdown diminished the PARP inhibitor effects. In view of the fact that TRAIL is part of the armamentarium of natural killer cells, these observations identify a new facet of PARP inhibitor action while simultaneously providing the mechanistic underpinnings of a novel therapeutic combination that warrants further investigation.

In view of the involvement of PARP1 in the DNA damage response, PARP inhibitors were initially explored for their ability to sensitize cells to ionizing radiation and other DNA damaging chemotherapy (13Rouleau M.

More recent studies have demonstrated that these agents are selectively toxic to breast and ovarian cancer cells lacking BRCA1, BRCA2, or other components of the Fanconi anemia/homologous recombination pathway. As a consequence, several of these agents are undergoing phase II and phase III clinical trials in cancers with homologous recombination deficiencies (12Ashworth A.

There is, however, substantial interest in identifying opportunities to successfully use these agents in cancers that lack homologous recombination deficiency. In the present study we report that PARP inhibitors synergize with death ligands. In particular, inhibition or knockdown of PARP1 and/or PARP2 results in enhanced expression of DR5 and Fas as well as enhanced sensitivity of cancer cell lines and clinical AML specimens to treatment with multiple death ligands, including agonistic anti-Fas antibody, recombinant human TRAIL, and agonistic anti-DR5 antibody. These results raise the possibility that responses to DR5 agonists might be enhanced by the addition of a relatively nontoxic and increasingly widely available new class of anticancer agents.

Poirier (Laval University, Quebec, Canada), and rat monoclonal anti-Bid antibody from A. Strasser (Walter and Elisa Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia). Cell lines were obtained from the following sources: human acute myeloid leukemia ML-1 from Michael Kastan (Duke University, Durham, NC); human chronic myeloid K562 cells from Robert Abraham (Pfizer); human lung cancer cell line A549 from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. PEO1 cells were grown as previously described (80Patel A.G. Sarkaria J.N. Kaufmann S.H. Nonhomologous end joining drives poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor lethality in homologous recombination-deficient cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 3406-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). To knock down PARP isoforms or Sp1, ML-1 cells were transduced with lentiviruses that were packaged in HEK293T cells by transfecting with the packaging vector psPAX2, envelope vector pMD2.G, and the MISSION® Lentiviral (Sigma) vector pLKO.1-puro containing hairpin shRNAs against human PARP isoform or Sp1 mRNAs. The targets of the PARP isoform shRNAs were as follows: PARP1, 5′-CCGAGAAATCTCTTACCTCAA-3′ (NM_001618.2-1176s1c1); PARP2, 5′-TCTGAATCCAGATGGTTATAC-3′ (NM_005484.3-1666s21c1); PARP3, 5′-CCCACTCCAAACTGGGTAATC-3′ (NM_001003931.2-1481s); PARP4, 5′-CCTGGGACTATTGGCTAAGAA-3′ (NM_006437.3-1123s21c1). The targets of Sp1 shRNAs were 5′-GCTGGTGGTGATGGAATACAT-3′ (NM_138473.2-1805s21c1, #1) or 5′GGCAGATCTGCAGTCCATTAA-3′ (NM_138473.2-2413s21c1, #2). After viral infection on two successive days, cells were cultured in medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin for at least a week before knockdown efficiency was examined by Western blot or quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) as described below. As an alternative, short oligonucleotides targeting human PARP1 (nucleotides 2242–2262 of coding sequence, GenBankTM accession number NM_001618.2) from Ambion (Austin, TX) were also used to assess the impact of PARP1 knockdown on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In brief, 1 × 107 log phase K562 cells growing in antibiotic-free medium were suspended in 400 μl of medium containing 5 μg of pEGFP-histone H2B and 1000 nm concentrations of control siRNA or PARP1 siRNA. After incubation for 5 min, cells were subjected to electroporation using a BTX830 square wave electroporator (BTX, San Diego, CA) delivering a single 10-ms pulse at 280 V. After a 24-h incubation, TRAIL was added for an additional 24 h before apoptosis was assessed. RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). qRT-PCR was performed in triplicate using 100 ng of RNA and TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen) per the supplier's instructions. Using PARP1 (Hs00242303_m1), PARP2 (Hs00193931_m1), PARP3 (Hs00193946_m1), PARP4 (Hs00173105-m1), Fas (Hs005331110-m1), DR4 (Hs00269492_m1), DR5 (Hs00366278,m1), and GAPDH (4352934E) probe sets from Invitrogen, RT-PCR was performed on a ABI Prism 7900HT Real-time system using a program consisting of 48 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 10 min, then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Data analysis was performed using the following equations: ΔCt = Ct(sample) − Ct(endogenous control); ΔΔCt = ΔCt(sample) − ΔCt(untreated); -fold change = 2 − ΔΔCt. After the indicated treatment, cells were stained with APC-conjugated annexin V in 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) as previously described (30Lee S.H. Meng X.W. Flatten K.S.

Aliquots containing 5 × 105 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 2% (v/v) FBS (PBS/FBS). Cells were incubated with the antibodies to Fas (APO-1-1) or CD71 or with APC-conjugated anti-TRAIL R2 (DR5) on ice for 60 min. To prevent any possible effect of caspase-8 activation due to incubation with the anti-death receptor antibodies, the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh (5 μm, Ref. 32Caserta T.M. Smith A.N. Gultice A.D.

After 2 washes, cells stained with APC-conjugated anti-TRAIL R2 were fixed with 4% (w/v) formaldehyde for 30 min, whereas cells stained with APO-1-1 or anti-CD71 antibody were incubated with APC-coupled anti-mouse IgG for 45 min, washed, then fixed with 4% (w/v) formaldehyde for 30 min before flow microfluorimetry. To assess whether PARP inhibitor affects Fas trafficking, cells were pretreated with PARP inhibitor or diluent for 24–48 h before the addition of mouse IgM control or CH.11 agonistic anti-Fas antibody for an additional 16 h in the presence of 5 μm Q-VD-OPh.

In brief, ML-1 cells were treated with DMSO or 0.5 μm olaparib for 48 h followed with 75 ng/ml CH.11 and 5 μm Q-VD-OPh for an additional 16 h. Aliquots containing 4 × 108 cells were harvested, washed, and solubilized at 4 °C for 30 min in DISC buffer consisting of 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 30 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 20 nm microcystin. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min to remove insoluble material, aliquots containing the same amount of protein (27 mg as assessed using the bicinchoninic acid method) from each treatment were added to 10 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgM that was precoupled to protein A- and G-agarose beads and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. At the end of the incubation, beads were sedimented at 14,000 × g for 3 min and washed 5 times with DISC buffer. Immunoprecipitated complexes were released from the beads by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibody to FADD or antibody to mouse IgM (indirectly reflecting the amount of Fas immunoprecipitated).

In brief, after treatment with diluent or olaparib, ML-1 cells were cross-linked in medium containing 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. 2 × 107 cells were washed in PBS, lysed in buffer containing 1% SDS, and sheared by sonication (Diagenode, Sparta, NJ) to fragment DNA to 200–1000 bp. Precleared chromatin was subjected to ChIP analysis using EZ-ChIPTM Kit regents (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C overnight with anti-Sp1 antibody or rabbit IgG as a control. Semiquantitative PCR was performed using the following primers encompassing the previously reported Sp1 binding site in the DR5 promoter: forward, 5′-AGGATTGCGTTGACGAGACT-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCGCGTGCTGATTTATGTGTCC-3′. 20 μl of each PCR product was subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.

In this context, synaptic transmission between light-excited rod and cone photoreceptors and downstream ON-bipolar neurons is a highly demanding energy consuming process. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a NAD-dependent deacylase, plays a key role in regulating glucose metabolism. In this study, we demonstrate that SIRT6 is highly expressed in the retina, controlling levels of histone H3K9 and H3K56 acetylation. Notably, despite apparent normal histology, SIRT6 deficiency caused major retinal transmission defects concomitant to changes in expression of glycolytic genes and glutamate receptors, as well as elevated levels of apoptosis in inner retina cells. Our results identify SIRT6 as a critical modulator of retinal function, likely through its effects on chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2093381141,"Purpose The expression of desmogleins (DSGs), which are known to be crucial for establishing and maintaining the cell-cell adhesion required for tissue integrity, has been well characterized in the epidermis and hair follicle; however, their expression in other epithelial tissues such as prostate is poorly understood. Although downregulation of classical cadherins, such as E-cadherin, has been described in prostate cancer tissue samples, the expression of desmogleins has only been previously reported in prostate cancer cell lines. In this study we characterized desmoglein expression in normal prostate tissues, and further investigated whether Desmoglein 2 (DSG2) expression specifically can serve as a potential clinical prognostic factor for patients diagnosed with primary prostate cancer. Experimental Design We utilized immunofluorescence to examine DSG2 expression in normal prostate (n = 50) and in a clinically well-characterized cohort of prostate cancer patients (n = 414). Correlation of DSG2 expression with clinico-pathological characteristics and biochemical recurrence was analyzed to assess its clinical significance. Results These studies revealed that DSG2 and DSG4 were specifically expressed in prostatic luminal cells, whereas basal cells lack their expression. In contrast, DSG1 and DSG3 were not expressed in normal prostate epithelium. Further analyses of DSG2 expression in prostate cancer revealed that reduced levels of this biomarker were a significant independent marker of poor clinical outcome. Conclusion Here we report for the first time that a low DSG2 expression phenotype is a useful prognostic biomarker of tumor aggressiveness and may serve as an aid in identifying patients with clinically significant prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2066627254,"Second messengers such as phosphoinositides and calcium are known to control diverse processes involved in the development of malaria parasites. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathways need to be unraveled, which may be achieved by understanding the regulation of effectors of these second messengers. Calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) family members regulate diverse parasitic processes. Because CDPKs are absent from the host, these kinases are considered as potential drug targets. We have dissected the function of an atypical CDPK from Plasmodium falciparum, PfCDPK7. The domain architecture of PfCDPK7 is very different from that of other CDPKs; it has a pleckstrin homology domain adjacent to the kinase domain and two calcium-binding EF-hands at its N terminus. We demonstrate that PfCDPK7 interacts with PI(4,5)P2 via its pleckstrin homology domain, which may guide its subcellular localization. Disruption of PfCDPK7 caused a marked reduction in the growth of the blood stage parasites, as maturation of rings to trophozoites was markedly stalled. In addition, parasite proliferation was significantly attenuated. These findings shed light on an important role for PfCDPK7 in the erythrocytic asexual cycle of malaria parasites."

To explore colony size augmentation strategies, recruits of the scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis were fed with live Artemia salina nauplii twice a week for 24 weeks in an ex situ coral nursery. Fed recruits grew significantly faster than unfed ones, with corals in the 3600, 1800, 600 and 0 (control) nauplii/L groups exhibiting volumetric growth rates of 10.65±1.46, 4.69±0.9, 3.64±0.55 and 1.18±0.37 mm3/week, respectively. Corals supplied with the highest density of nauplii increased their ecological volume by more than 74 times their initial size, achieving a mean final volume of 248.38±33.44 mm3. The benefits of feeding were apparent even after transplantation to the reef. The corals in the 3600, 1800, 600 and 0 nauplii/L groups grew to final sizes of 4875±260 mm3, 2036±627 mm3, 1066±70 mm3 and 512±116 mm3, respectively. The fed corals had significantly higher survival rates than the unfed ones after transplantation (63%, 59%, 56% and 38% for the 3600, 1800, 600 and 0 nauplii/L treatments respectively). Additionally, cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that the costs per unit volumetric growth were drastically reduced with increasing feed densities. Corals fed with the highest density of nauplii were the most cost-effective (US$0.02/mm3), and were more than 12 times cheaper than the controls. This study demonstrated that nutrition enhancement can augment coral growth and post-transplantation survival, and is a biologically and economically viable option that can be used to supplement existing coral mariculture procedures and enhance reef restoration outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2096420258,"Reliable estimates of population size are fundamental in many ecological studies and biodiversity conservation. Selecting appropriate methods to estimate abundance is often very difficult, especially if data are scarce. Most studies concerning the reliability of different estimators used simulation data based on assumptions about capture variability that do not necessarily reflect conditions in natural populations. Here, we used data from an intensively studied closed population of the arboreal gecko Gehyra variegata to construct reference population sizes for assessing twelve different population size estimators in terms of bias, precision, accuracy, and their 95%-confidence intervals. Two of the reference populations reflect natural biological entities, whereas the other reference populations reflect artificial subsets of the population. Since individual heterogeneity was assumed, we tested modifications of the Lincoln-Petersen estimator, a set of models in programs MARK and CARE-2, and a truncated geometric distribution. Ranking of methods was similar across criteria. Models accounting for individual heterogeneity performed best in all assessment criteria. For populations from heterogeneous habitats without obvious covariates explaining individual heterogeneity, we recommend using the moment estimator or the interpolated jackknife estimator (both implemented in CAPTURE/MARK). If data for capture frequencies are substantial, we recommend the sample coverage or the estimating equation (both models implemented in CARE-2). Depending on the distribution of catchabilities, our proposed multiple Lincoln-Petersen and a truncated geometric distribution obtained comparably good results. The former usually resulted in a minimum population size and the latter can be recommended when there is a long tail of low capture probabilities. Models with covariates and mixture models performed poorly. Our approach identified suitable methods and extended options to evaluate the performance of mark-recapture population size estimators under field conditions, which is essential for selecting an appropriate method and obtaining reliable results in ecology and conservation biology, and thus for sound management."

The Saudi Arabian tribe subgroup traces its origin to the Najd region of Saudi Arabia. By sequencing two whole genomes and thirteen exomes from this subgroup at high coverage (>40X), we identify 4,950,724 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), 515,802 indels and 39,762 structural variations. Of the identified variants, 10,098 (8.3%) exomic SNPs, 139,923 (2.9%) non-exomic SNPs, 5,256 (54.3%) exomic indels, and 374,959 (74.08%) non-exomic indels are ‘novel’. Up to 8,070 (79.9%) of the reported novel biallelic exomic SNPs are seen in low frequency (minor allele frequency <5%). We observe 5,462 known and 1,004 novel potentially deleterious nonsynonymous SNPs. Allele frequencies of common SNPs from the 15 exomes is significantly correlated with those from genotype data of a larger cohort of 48 individuals (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.91; p <2.2×10−16). A set of 2,485 SNPs show significantly different allele frequencies when compared to populations from other continents. Two notable variants having risk alleles in high frequencies in this subgroup are: a nonsynonymous deleterious SNP (rs2108622 [19:g.15990431C>T] from CYP4F2 gene [MIM:*604426]) associated with warfarin dosage levels [MIM:#122700] required to elicit normal anticoagulant response; and a 3′ UTR SNP (rs6151429 [22:g.51063477T>C]) from ARSA gene [MIM:*607574]) associated with Metachromatic Leukodystrophy [MIM:#250100]. Hemoglobin Riyadh variant (identified for the first time in a Saudi Arabian woman) is observed in the exome data. The mitochondrial haplogroup profiles of the 15 individuals are consistent with the haplogroup diversity seen in Saudi Arabian natives, who are believed to have received substantial gene flow from Africa and eastern provenance. We present the first genome resource imperative for designing future genetic studies in Saudi Arabian tribe subgroup.

This study was designed to characterize the prevalence of HEV infection among pet dogs and cats in major metropolitan areas of China. We conducted a seroepidemiological survey from 2012 to 2013 in 5 developed cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Canton, Shenzhen and Macao, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The overall HEV seroprevalence in 658 dog and 191 cat serum samples was 21.12% and 6.28%, respectively. The analysis in dogs suggested that there were significant differences among cities, and the positive rate of HEV-specific antibody in all cities ranged from 6.06% (Shenzhen) to 29.34% (Beijing). Older pet cats have a high risk (OR, 10.25) for HEV seropositivity, but no strong relationship was observed between different genders and age groups. Additionally, it was revealed that stray dogs, omnivorous pet dogs and pet cats who share food, such as kitchen residue, with the general population would have a higher risk for HEV seropositivity. The odds ratios for these groups are 2.40, 2.83 and 5.39, respectively, compared with pet dogs and cats fed on commercial food. In this study, we first report that HEV is prevalent in pet dogs and cats in several large cities in China. Swill and kitchen residue may be a potential risk for HEV transmission from human to pets. As the sample size was relatively small in this study and may not be fully representative of China, further investigation is required to confirm the conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W2069499899,"Recently, the development of biobanks linked to electronic medical records has presented new opportunities for genetic and epidemiological research. Studies based on these resources, however, present unique challenges, including the accurate assignment of individual-level population ancestry. In this work we examine the accuracy of administratively-assigned race in diverse populations by comparing assigned races to genetically-defined ancestry estimates. Using 220 ancestry informative markers, we generated principal components for patients in our dataset, which were used to cluster patients into groups based on genetic ancestry. Consistent with other studies, we find a strong overall agreement (Kappa = 0.872) between genetic ancestry and assigned race, with higher rates of agreement for African-descent and European-descent assignments, and reduced agreement for Hispanic, East Asian-descent, and South Asian-descent assignments. These results suggest caution when selecting study samples of non-African and non-European backgrounds when administratively-assigned race from biobanks is used."
https://openalex.org/W1971201413,"Bystander effects have been observed repeatedly in mammalian cells following photon and alpha particle irradiation. However, few studies have been performed to investigate bystander effects arising from neutron irradiation. Here we asked whether neutrons also induce a bystander effect in two normal human lymphoblastoid cell lines. These cells were exposed to fast neutrons produced by targeting a near-monoenergetic 50.5 MeV proton beam at a Be target (17 MeV average neutron energy), and irradiated-cell conditioned media (ICCM) was transferred to unirradiated cells. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay was used to quantify genetic damage in radiation-naïve cells exposed to ICCM from cultures that received 0 (control), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 or 4 Gy neutrons. Cells grown in ICCM from irradiated cells showed no significant increase in the frequencies of micronuclei or nucleoplasmic bridges compared to cells grown in ICCM from sham irradiated cells for either cell line. However, the neutron beam has a photon dose-contamination of 5%, which may modulate a neutron-induced bystander effect. To determine whether these low doses of contaminating photons can induce a bystander effect, cells were irradiated with cobalt-60 at doses equivalent to the percent contamination for each neutron dose. No significant increase in the frequencies of micronuclei or bridges was observed at these doses of photons for either cell line when cultured in ICCM. As expected, high doses of photons induced a clear bystander effect in both cell lines for micronuclei and bridges (p<0.0001). These data indicate that neutrons do not induce a bystander effect in these cells. Finally, neutrons had a relative biological effectiveness of 2.0 ± 0.13 for micronuclei and 5.8 ± 2.9 for bridges compared to cobalt-60. These results may be relevant to radiation therapy with fast neutrons and for regulatory agencies setting standards for neutron radiation protection and safety."
https://openalex.org/W1977106171,"Natalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the leukocyte adhesion molecule very late antigen (VLA)-4, and is currently an approved therapy for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). However, it is unknown whether natalizumab is beneficial for progressive forms of MS. Therefore, we assessed the effects of anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy in a progressive experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model. Notably, we found that early therapy could significantly reduce the severity of progressive EAE, while treatment initiated at an advanced stage was less efficient. Furthermore, we observed the accumulation of a novel subset of GM-CSF-producing CD11b+CD4+ T cells in the CNS throughout disease progression. Importantly, early therapeutic anti-VLA-4 mAb treatment suppressed the accumulation of these GM-CSF-producing CD11b+CD4+ T cells in the CNS along with activated microglia/macrophages populations, and also conferred a protective effect against inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration, including demyelination and axonal loss. Collectively, our data suggest that early treatment with anti-VLA-4 mAb can provide neuroprotection against progressive CNS autoimmune disease by preventing the accumulation of pathogenic GM-CSF-producing CD11b+CD4+ T cells in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2033370173,"Background The neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR1) and its ligand neuropeptide S (NPS) have received increased attention in the last few years, as both establish a previously unknown system of neuromodulation. Animal research studies have suggested that NPS may be involved in arousal/wakefulness and may also have a crucial role in sleep regulation. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs324981 in NPSR1 has begun to shed light on a function of the NPS-system in human sleep regulation. Due to an amino acid exchange, the T-allele leads to an increased sensitivity of the NPSR1. In the only genome-wide association study to date on circadian sleep parameters in humans, an association was found between rs324981 and regular bedtime. However, the sleep parameters in this study were only measured by self-rating. Therefore, our study aimed to replicate these findings using an objective measure of sleep. Methods The study included n = 393 white subjects (62–79 years) who participated in an actigraphic assessment for determining sleep duration, rest duration, sleep onset, rest onset and sleep onset latency. Genotyping of the SNP rs324981 was performed using the TaqMan OpenArray System. Results The genotype at rs324981 was not significantly associated with rest onset (bedtime) or sleep onset (p = .146 and p = .199, respectively). However, the SNP showed a significant effect on sleep- and rest duration (p = .007 and p = .003, respectively). Subjects that were homozygous for the minor T-allele had a significantly decreased sleep- and rest duration compared to A-allele carriers. Conclusion The results of this study indicate that the sleep pattern in humans is influenced by the NPS-system. However, the previously reported association between bedtime and rs324981 could not be confirmed. The current finding of decreased sleep duration in T/T allele carriers is in accordance with studies in rodents reporting similar results after NPS application."
https://openalex.org/W2043703539,"Studying chemical disturbances during neural differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) has been established as an alternative in vitro testing approach for the identification of developmental neurotoxicants. miRNAs represent a class of small non-coding RNA molecules involved in the regulation of neural development and ESC differentiation and specification. Thus, neural differentiation of mESCs in vitro allows investigating the role of miRNAs in chemical-mediated developmental toxicity. We analyzed changes in miRNome and transcriptome during neural differentiation of mESCs exposed to the developmental neurotoxicant sodium valproate (VPA). A total of 110 miRNAs and 377 mRNAs were identified differently expressed in neurally differentiating mESCs upon VPA treatment. Based on miRNA profiling we observed that VPA shifts the lineage specification from neural to myogenic differentiation (upregulation of muscle-abundant miRNAs, mir-206, mir-133a and mir-10a, and downregulation of neural-specific mir-124a, mir-128 and mir-137). These findings were confirmed on the mRNA level and via immunochemistry. Particularly, the expression of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) as well as muscle-specific genes (Actc1, calponin, myosin light chain, asporin, decorin) were found elevated, while genes involved in neurogenesis (e.g. Otx1, 2, and Zic3, 4, 5) were repressed. These results were specific for valproate treatment and―based on the following two observations―most likely due to the inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity: (i) we did not observe any induction of muscle-specific miRNAs in neurally differentiating mESCs exposed to the unrelated developmental neurotoxicant sodium arsenite; and (ii) the expression of muscle-abundant mir-206 and mir-10a was similarly increased in cells exposed to the structurally different HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). Based on our results we conclude that miRNA expression profiling is a suitable molecular endpoint for developmental neurotoxicity. The observed lineage shift into myogenesis, where miRNAs may play an important role, could be one of the developmental neurotoxic mechanisms of VPA."
https://openalex.org/W2072778384,"Fusobacterium nucleatum is a ubiquitous member of the human oral flora and is associated with the development of periodontitis and a variety of other types of polymicrobial infections of the mucosa. In the oral cavity, this species is one of the few that is prevalent in both healthy and diseased subgingival plaque. Using microarray analysis, we examined the transcriptional response of F. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum to whole blood in order to identify some of the genetic responses that might occur during the transition from health to disease. From these studies, we identified a sialic acid catabolism operon that was induced by the presence of blood. We subsequently confirmed that this operon was inducible by the presence of synthetic sialic acid, but we found no evidence suggesting sialic acid was used as a major carbon source. However, this organism was found to possess a de novo synthesized surface sialylation ability that is widely conserved among the various F. nucleatum subspecies as well as in F. periodonticum. We provide evidence that fusobacterial sialylation does occur in the oral cavity irrespective of health status. Interestingly, only a minority of fusobacterial cells exhibit surface sialylation within dental plaque, whereas most cells are uniformly sialylated when grown in pure culture. The implications of these results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1975195936,"An angiogenesis factor, angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), is associated with the blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption after focal cerebral ischemia. However, whether hemorrhagic transformation and cerebral edema after tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment are related to the decrease in Ang1 expression in the BBB remains unknown. We hypothesized that administering Ang1 might attenuate hemorrhagic transformation and cerebral edema after tPA treatment by stabilizing blood vessels and inhibiting hyperpermeability. Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to thromboembolic focal cerebral ischemia were assigned to a permanent ischemia group (permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion; PMCAO) and groups treated with tPA at 1 h or 4 h after ischemia. Endogenous Ang1 expression was observed in pericytes, astrocytes, and neuronal cells. Western blot analyses revealed that Ang1 expression levels on the ischemic side of the cerebral cortex were decreased in the tPA-1h, tPA-4h, and PMCAO groups as compared to those in the control group (P = 0.014, 0.003, and 0.014, respectively). Ang1-positive vessel densities in the tPA-4h and PMCAO groups were less than that in the control group (p = 0.002 and <0.001, respectively) as well as that in the tPA-1h group (p = 0.047 and 0.005, respectively). These results suggest that Ang1-positive vessel density was maintained when tPA was administered within the therapeutic time window (1 h), while it was decreased when tPA treatment was given after the therapeutic time window (4 h). Administering Ang1 fused with cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP) to supplement this decrease has the potential to suppress hemorrhagic transformation as measured by hemoglobin content in a whole cerebral homogenate (p = 0.007) and cerebral edema due to BBB damage (p = 0.038), as compared to administering COMP protein alone. In conclusion, Ang1 might be a promising target molecule for developing vasoprotective therapies for controlling hemorrhagic transformation and cerebral edema after tPA treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2068316951,"Hydrogen sulfide is a gasotransmitter with vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Aspirin is an irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor anti-inflammatory drug. ACS14 is a novel synthetic hydrogen sulfide releasing aspirin which inhibits cyclooxygenase and has antioxidant effects. Methylglyoxal is a chemically active metabolite of glucose and fructose, and a major precursor of advanced glycation end products formation. Methylglyoxal is harmful when produced in excess. Plasma methylglyoxal levels are significantly elevated in diabetic patients. Our aim was to investigate the effects of ACS14 on methylglyoxal levels in cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. We used cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells for the study. Methylglyoxal was measured by HPLC after derivatization, and nitrite+nitrate with an assay kit. Western blotting was used to determine NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression. Dicholorofluorescein assay was used to measure oxidative stress. ACS14 significantly attenuated elevation of intracellular methylglyoxal levels caused by incubating cultured vascular smooth muscle cells with methylglyoxal (30 µM) and high glucose (25 mM). ACS14, but not aspirin, caused a significant attenuation of increase in nitrite+nitrate levels caused by methylglyoxal or high glucose. ACS14, aspirin, and sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS, a hydrogen sulfide donor), all attenuated the increase in oxidative stress caused by methylglyoxal and high glucose in cultured cells. ACS14 prevented the increase in NOX4 expression caused by incubating the cultured VSMCs with MG (30 µM). ACS14, aspirin and NaHS attenuated the increase in iNOS expression caused by high glucose (25 mM). In conclusion, ACS14 has the novel ability to attenuate an increase in methylglyoxal levels which in turn can reduce oxidative stress, decrease the formation of advanced glycation end products and prevent many of the known deleterious effects of elevated methylglyoxal. Thus, ACS14 has the potential to be especially beneficial for diabetic patients pending further in vivo studies."
https://openalex.org/W2159167418,"Alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5) is a conserved enzyme for alcohol and aldehyde metabolism in mammals. Despite dynamic expression throughout neurogenesis, its role in neuronal development remains unknown. Here we present the first evidence that ADH5 is a negative regulator of neuronal differentiation. Gene expression analyses identify a constant reduction of ADH5 levels throughout neuronal development. Overexpression of ADH5 reduces both development and adult neuronal differentiation of mouse neurons. This effect depends on the catalytic activity of ADH5 and involves ADH5-mediated denitrosation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2). Our results indicate that ADH5 counteracts neuronal differentiation of human neural stem cells and that this effect can be reversed by pharmacological inhibition of ADH5. Based on these observations, we propose that ADH5 is a novel suppressor of neuronal differentiation and maturation. Inhibition of ADH5 may improve adult neurogenesis in a physiological or pathological setting."
https://openalex.org/W2104467545,"Background Trends in adolescent smoking rates in South Korea have not shown substantial progress due to a lack of effective anti-smoking interventions and policies in school settings. Methods and Findings We examined individual- and school-level determinants of adolescent smoking behavior (ever smoking, current smoking, and daily smoking) using the nationally representative fifth Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey conducted in 2009. We found that students in coeducation schools or vocational high schools had greater risks of smoking for each type of smoking behavior than those in single-sex schools or general high schools, respectively even after controlling for individual-level factors. Higher family affluence and higher weekly allowances were associated with greater risks of ever smoking, current smoking and daily smoking even after controlling for parental education and other confounders. Conclusions Whilst caution is required in interpreting results given the cross-sectional nature of the study, our findings suggest that in addition to raising the price of cigarettes, youth anti-smoking interventions in South Korea may benefit from focusing on coeducation schools and vocational high schools."

The aim of this study is to prepare one NPs (nanoparticles) loaded with 5-FU and investigate the characteristic of NPs and the role of it in peritoneal metastasis nodules formation of human colon cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings Prepared the NPs (nanoparticles) loaded with 5-FU (5-Fluorouracil) by PEG-PLGA with the method of double emulsion. Then evaluate the characteristics of the NPs by scanning electron microscopy, analyzing the particle diameter distribution and determining the loading efficiency. Detect the release features of NPs in vitro and in vivo. Nude mice with peritoneal metastases were treated with 5-FU solution or 5-FU-NPs through peritoneal cavity. Count the nodules on peritoneum and mesenterium and survey the size of them. We got NPs with average-diameter of 310 nm. In vitro release test shows NPs can release equably for 5 days with release rate of 99.2%. In vivo, NPs group can keep higher plasma concentration of 5-FU longer than it in solution group. The number of peritoneal dissemination nodule below 1 mm in 5-FU-sol group(17.3±3.5) and 5-FU-NP group(15.2±3.2) is less than control group(27.2±4.7)(P<0.05). The total number of nodules in 5-FU-NP group(28.7±4.2) is significantly smaller than in 5-FU-sol group(37.7±6.3) (P<0.05).

https://openalex.org/W2074984916,"Most previous studies concerning linking dynamics often assumed that links pairing individuals should be identified and treated differently during topology adjusting procedure, in order to promote cooperation. A common assumption was that cooperators were expected to avoid being exploited by quickly breaking up relationships with defectors. Then the so-called prosocial links linking two cooperators (abbreviated as CC links hereafter) would be much favored by evolution, whereby cooperation was promoted. However, we suggest that this is not always necessary. Here, we developed a minimal model in which an aspiration-based partner switching mechanism was embedded to regulate the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas. Individuals adjusted social ties in a self-questioning manner in line with the learning theory. Less game information was involved during dynamic linking and all links were tackled anonymously irrespective of their types (i.e., CD links, DD links, or CC links). The main results indicate that cooperation flourishes for a broad range of parameters. The denser the underlying network, the more difficult the evolution of cooperation. More importantly, moderate aspirations do much better in promoting the evolution of altruistic behavior and for most cases there exists the optimal aspiration level that most benefits cooperation. Too strong or too weak selection intensity turns out to be pretty conducive to the evolution of cooperation in such a dynamical system."
https://openalex.org/W2163667203,"Considering the importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of essential processes in plant pathogen interactions, it is not surprising that, while plant miRNA sequences counteract viral attack via antiviral RNA silencing, viruses in turn have developed antihost defense mechanisms blocking these RNA silencing pathways and establish a counter-defense. In the current study, computational and stem-loop Reverse Transcription – Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) approaches were employed to a) predict and validate virus encoded mature miRNAs (miRs) in 39 DNA-A sequences of the bipartite genomes of African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) and East African cassava mosaic virus-Uganda (EACMV-UG) isolates, b) determine whether virus encoded miRs/miRs* generated from the 5′/3′ harpin arms have the capacity to bind to genomic sequences of the host plants Jatropha or cassava and c) investigate whether plant encoded miR/miR* sequences have the potential to bind to the viral genomes. Different viral pre-miRNA hairpin sequences and viral miR/miR* length variants occurring as isomiRs were predicted in both viruses. These miRNAs were located in three Open Reading Frames (ORFs) and in the Intergenic Region (IR). Moreover, various target genes for miRNAs from both viruses were predicted and annotated in the host plant genomes indicating that they are involved in biotic response, metabolic pathways and transcription factors. Plant miRs/miRs* from conserved and highly expressed families were identified, which were shown to have potential targets in the genome of both begomoviruses, representing potential plant miRNAs mediating antiviral defense. This is the first assessment of predicted viral miRs/miRs* of ACMV and EACMV-UG and host plant miRNAs, providing a reference point for miRNA identification in pathogens and their hosts. These findings will improve the understanding of host- pathogen interaction pathways and the function of viral miRNAs in Euphorbiaceous crop plants."

Objective Determine the prevalence of WHO NRTI/NNRTI/PI TDRs in ART-naïve subjects in Hunan Province by deep sequencing. Methods ART-naïve subjects diagnosed in Hunan between 2010–2011 were evaluated by deep sequencing for low-frequency HIV variants possessing WHO TDRs to 1% levels. Mutations were scored using the HIVdb.stanford.edu algorithm to infer drug susceptibility. Results Deep sequencing was performed on samples from 90 ART-naïve subjects; 83.3% were AE subtype. All subjects had advanced disease (average CD4 count 134 cells/mm3). Overall 25.6%(23/90) of subjects had HIV with major WHO NRTI/NNRTI TDRs by deep sequencing at a variant frequency level ≥1%; 16.7%(15/90) had NRTI TDR and 12.2%(11/90) had a major NNRTI TDR. The majority of NRTI/NNRTI mutations were identified at variant levels <5%. Mutations were analyzed by HIVdb.stanford.edu and 7.8% of subjects had variants with high-level nevirapine resistance; 4.4% had high-level NRTI resistance. Deep sequencing identified 24(27.6%) subjects with variants possessing either a PI TDR or hivdb.stanford.edu PI mutation (algorithm value≥15). 17(19.5%) had PI TDRs at levels >1%. Conclusions ART-naïve subjects from Hunan Province China infected predominantly with subtype AE frequently possessed HIV variants with WHO NRTI/NNRTI TDRs by deep sequencing that would affect the first line ART used in the region. Specific mutations conferring nevirapine high-level resistance were identified in 7.8% of subjects. The majority of TDRs detected were at variant levels <5% likely due to subjects having advanced chronic disease at the time of testing. PI TDRs were identified frequently, but were found in isolation and at low variant frequency. As PI/r use is infrequent in Hunan, the existence of PI mutations likely represent AE subtype natural polymorphism at low variant level frequency."
https://openalex.org/W1994813669,"In protein-coding genes, synonymous mutations are often thought not to affect fitness and therefore are not subject to natural selection. Yet increasingly, cases of non-neutral evolution at certain synonymous sites were reported over the last decade. To evaluate the extent and the nature of site-specific selection on synonymous codons, we computed the site-to-site synonymous rate variation (SRV) and identified gene properties that make SRV more likely in a large database of protein-coding gene families and protein domains. To our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the determinants and patterns of the SRV in real data. We show that the SRV is widespread in the evolution of protein-coding sequences, putting in doubt the validity of the synonymous rate as a standard neutral proxy. While protein domains rarely undergo adaptive evolution, the SRV appears to play important role in optimizing the domain function at the level of DNA. In contrast, protein families are more likely to evolve by positive selection, but are less likely to exhibit SRV. Stronger SRV was detected in genes with stronger codon bias and tRNA reusage, those coding for proteins with larger number of interactions or forming larger number of structures, located in intracellular components and those involved in typically conserved complex processes and functions. Genes with extreme SRV show higher expression levels in nearly all tissues. This indicates that codon bias in a gene, which often correlates with gene expression, may often be a site-specific phenomenon regulating the speed of translation along the sequence, consistent with the co-translational folding hypothesis. Strikingly, genes with SRV were strongly overrepresented for metabolic pathways and those associated with several genetic diseases, particularly cancers and diabetes."

They contain a poly-HAMP module at their N terminus, which plays a pivotal role in osmosensing as well as fungal death upon exposure to fludioxonil. DhNik1p is a typical member of this class that contains five HAMP domains and four HAMP-like linkers. We investigated the contribution of each of the HAMP-like linker regions to the functionality of DhNik1p and found that the HAMP4b linker was essential as its deletion resulted in the complete loss of activity.

HAMP domains are widely distributed among proteins associated with signal transduction in prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic organisms, such histidine kinases, adenyl cyclases, methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins and phosphatases (10Aravind L. Ponting C.P. The cytoplasmic helical linker domain of receptor histidine kinase and methyl-accepting proteins is common to many prokaryotic signalling proteins.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 111-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These domains are composed of ∼50 amino acids with two amphipathic helices (11Appleman J.A. Stewart V. Mutational analysis of a conserved signal-transducing element: the HAMP linker of the Escherichia coli nitrate sensor NarX.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). HAMP domains have been established as signal transduction modules in prokaryotic sensor kinases, where single HAMP domains connect a membrane bound sensing (input) domain to the cytoplasmic output domain. Genetic and structural studies on bacterial transmembrane sensor kinases suggested stimulus induced conformational changes in the HAMP domain structure as the mode of signal transmission (12Hulko M. Berndt F. Gruber M. Linder J.U. Truffault V. Schultz A. Martin J. Schultz J.E. Lupas A.N. Coles M.

Nik1 orthologs have been identified from both pathogenic and nonpathogenic fungi. The number of HAMP domain repeats varies among different types of fungi. As per the SMART database Nik1 orthologs from yeast contain five HAMP domains, whereas those from filamentous ascomycetes and basidiomycetes contain six and seven HAMP domains, respectively (14Randhawa A. Mondal A.K. The sixth HAMP domain negatively regulates the activity of the group III HHK containing seven HAMP domains.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 438: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the HAMP domains have been shown to affect fludioxonil sensitivity as well as osmosensing functions of Nik1 orthologs (8Yoshimi A. Tsuda M. Tanaka C.

The poly-HAMP module plays a very important role in the functionality of the group III HHK and appears to function both as sensor and regulator of its activity. However, the structural details of these phenotypes are not very clear. We have previously characterized DhNik1p, a group III HHK from the halotolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii. DhNik1p complements the sln1 deletion in S. cerevisiae and functions as a bona fide osmosensor (9Meena N. Kaur H. Mondal A.K. Interactions among HAMP domain repeats act as an osmosensing molecular switch in group III hybrid histidine kinases from fungi.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12121-12132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Like a typical group III HHK from yeast, DhNik1p contains five HAMP domains. Deletion analysis suggested that the HAMP domains are functionally distinct. Although the fourth domain is dispensable for histidine kinase activity of DhNik1p, it regulates the osmosensing function as well as the fludioxonil sensitivity mediated by the molecule (9Meena N. Kaur H. Mondal A.K. Interactions among HAMP domain repeats act as an osmosensing molecular switch in group III hybrid histidine kinases from fungi.J. Biol.

Fungal fludioxonil sensitivity is diminished by a constitutively active form of the group III histidine kinase.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 2417-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In DhNik1p, the HAMP domains are interspersed with linker sequences. Recent studies suggested that these linker sequences also have HAMP-like features that are different from the canonical HAMP domains and therefore classified as divergent (18Dunin-Horkawicz S. Lupas A.N. Comprehensive analysis of HAMP domains: implications for transmembrane signal transduction.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 397: 1156-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Stewart V.

Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 734-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To understand the role of the linker regions in DhNik1p, we carried out functional analysis of different linker mutants. The results were correlated with a structural model of the dimeric form of the protein as it exists in solution. S. cerevisiae strains AMY1000 (MATa his3-1 leu2-0 met15-0 pSLN1::kanR-tetO7-TATA URA3::CMV-tTA ste11::hph) and NM1 (MATa sln1Δ::LEU2 ste11::hph his3-Δ200 leu2Δ1 ura3–52 trp1Δ63 with pRS-PTP2 URA3) (9Meena N. Kaur H. Mondal A.K. Interactions among HAMP domain repeats act as an osmosensing molecular switch in group III hybrid histidine kinases from fungi.J. Biol.

AMY1000 was constructed from S. cerevisiae strain R1158 (MATa his3-1 leu2-0 met15-0 URA3::CMV-tTA) (20Mnaimneh S. Davierwala A.P. Haynes J. Moffat J. Peng W.-T. Zhang W. Yang X. Pootoolal J. Chua G.

S. cerevisiae strain YSH2472 (MATa leu2–3,112 trp1-1 his3–11,15 ade2-1 can1–100 sln1::LEU2 ssk1::kanMX ura3-1::YIpSSRE-lacZ) was used as host for β-galactosidase reporter assay (17Furukawa K. Randhawa A. Kaur H. Mondal A.K. Hohmann S. Fungal fludioxonil sensitivity is diminished by a constitutively active form of the group III histidine kinase.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 2417-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All mutant constructs were made by overlap extension PCR (21Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension using the polymerase chain reaction.Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar) using different primers, the sequences will be made available upon request. The mutant constructs E-AΔ1b, E-AΔ2b, E-AΔ3b, and E-AΔ4b carrying different single HAMP-like domain deletions was based on the boundaries predicted by SMART analysis. For E-AΔ1b, a construct designed to produce a DhNik1p mutant lacking the first HAMP-like domain (109–146 amino acid residues), two PCR were carried out utilizing primer pairs Dnik-NcoIF/E-A1b R and E-A1b F/Dnik1EcoRI_R. The PCR products were combined in third PCR using Dnik-NcoIF and Dnik1EcoRI_R primers. The resultant ∼1.830-kb fragment was cloned in pDhNIK1 replacing the ∼1.9-kb wild type sequence flanked by NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites. Similarly, E-AΔ2b (Δ200–238), E-AΔ3b (Δ292–330), and E-AΔ4b (Δ384–422), devoid of second, third, and fourth HAMP domains, respectively, were made. In another set of mutants, the deletions spanned the entire divergent HAMP domains to obtain F-LΔ1b (Δ106–149), F-LΔ2b (Δ197–241), F-LΔ3b (Δ289–333), and F-LΔ4b (Δ381–425). To modify the length and residue composition of individual HAMP-like domains H1b, H2b, H3b, or H4b, they were replaced with an unrelated Gly-rich pentapeptide sequence -GGGGS to obtain L5Δ1b, L5Δ2b, L5Δ3b, and L5Δ4b mutants, respectively. Similarly, DhNik1p mutants wherein H1b, H2b, H3b, or H4b HAMP-like domain was replaced with three pentapeptide sequences in tandem-(GGGGS)3 were designated as L15Δ1b, L15Δ2b, L15Δ3b, and L15Δ4b, respectively. The mutants E-A41b, E-A42b, and E-A43b were made by replacing the H4b linker with H1b, H2b, and H3b, respectively. In all the mutant sets, each HAMP-like domain boundary marked by E-A residues was replaced. To probe the role of the stutter elements in the activity of DhNik1p, mutants Δ1a, Δ2a, Δ3a, and Δ4a were constructed. In Δ1a, four amino acid residues (149LTNQ152) were deleted to remove stutter between H1b and H2 by overlap extension PCR strategy. For constructing Δ1a, two separate PCR were performed by utilizing the primer pairs, forward Dnik-NcoIF with the corresponding reverse mutagenic primer and the corresponding forward mutagenic primer with reverse Dnik1EcoRI_R to obtain the overlapping mutated products. These products were combined in third PCR using Dnik-NcoIF and Dnik1EcoRI_R primers. The amplified fragment was digested with NcoI and EcoRI and cloned into NcoI- and EcoRI-digested pDhNik1. Similarly for Δ2a, Δ3a, and Δ4a, amino acid residues 241LTTQ244, 333LTNQ336, and 425LTSQ428, were deleted, respectively, using different primers. For fludioxonil sensitivity assay, freshly grown cultures (12 h at 28 °C) were normalized to A600 1.0. Serial dilutions were made in sterile water, and 5 μl of a 10-fold dilution series were spotted onto agar plates supplemented with or without fludioxonil as indicated. Growth was monitored for 2–3 days at 30 °C. Levels of dually phosphorylated Hog1p in S. cerevisiae strains AMY1000 expressing DhNik1p or its mutants were detected by Western blotting. Cells were grown in synthetic medium supplemented with appropriate amino acids (and doxycycline whenever required) until an A600 of 0.7–0.8 and either harvested as such or subjected to fludioxonil for 15 min before centrifugation. The resulting cell pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The total cell extract (20 μg of protein) from each sample was blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and dually phosphorylated Hog1p was detected using an anti-dual phosphorylated p38 antibody (Cell Signaling Inc.) as described earlier (22Sharma P. Meena N. Aggarwal M. Mondal A. Debaryomyces hansenii, a highly osmo-tolerant and halo-tolerant yeast, maintains activated Dhog1p in the cytoplasm during its growth under severe osmotic stress.Curr. Genet. 2005; 48: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The level of Hog1p was detected in the same blot after re-probing with anti-Hog1p antibody (Y-215; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were detected with the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). S. cerevisiae strain YSH2472 expressing DhNik1p or its mutants were grown up to logarithmic phase in synthetic medium supplemented with appropriate amino acids at 28 °C with or without 5 μg/ml of fludioxonil. For the β-galactosidase assay, 10 ml of each culture was recovered by centrifugation. Cells were washed once and resuspended in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4·2H2O, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgSO4·7H2O, pH 7.0). To permeabilize the cells, 1.0 ml of each culture (1.0 A600) was kept in liquid nitrogen for 1 min to then be heated at 37 °C for 3 min. This cycle was repeated three times. To start the reaction, 500 μl of Z buffer containing 37.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 200 μl of o-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (4 mg/ml) were added to 500 μl of permeabilized cells. Samples were incubated at 30 °C until the appearance of a yellow color and the reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 1 m Na2CO3. The samples were centrifuged and absorbance (at 420 nm) was measured in the supernatants. β-Galactosidase activity was expressed as nanomoles of o-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside utilized per minute by 1 ml of culture, which was normalized to 1.0 A600. Values represent the mean ± S.D. of two independent pools of six transformants each. The N-terminal region of DhNIK1p consisting of HAMP domains 1–3 (1–291 aa), HAMP domains 1–4 (1–383 aa), or HAMP domains 1–5 (1–480 aa) was expressed with an in-frame N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag for the ease of protein purification. The different constructs (HAMP1–3 MBP, HAMP1–4 MBP, and HAMP1–5 MBP) or the vector pMAL-c2 was transformed into Escherichia coli strain ER2508 for overexpression and subsequent purification of MBP-tagged fusion proteins. Overnight cultures of these clones (at 37 °C in LB broth + 0.2% glucose supplemented with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin) were re-inoculated and grown to an A600 of 0.5. Cells were then induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and further grown at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science). After addition of lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml), the cells were disrupted by sonication. Recombinant MBP fusion protein from the supernatant fraction was then purified under native conditions, using amylose resin according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs Inc.). Absolute molecular weights were determined with static laser light scattering using a Wyatt Dawn Heleos 8+ MALLS detector (Wyatt Technology) coupled to a Waters HPLC protein purification system with a Shodex High Performance size exclusion column. Different HAMP constructs, namely HAMP1–3 MBP, HAMP1–4 MBP, and HAMP1–5 MBP at concentrations of 1, 0.786, and 0.697 mg/ml, respectively, were injected in a volume of 100 μl to the column equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm DTT at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. A BSA sample (5 mg/ml) was used as a reference to calibrate the system. The absolute molecular weights of individual peaks in the size exclusion chromatogram were determined using Astra software package version 6.0.3. A standard value of refractive index (dn/dc = 0.185 ml/g) was used for proteins. The SAXS data were collected at the X9 beam line (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Brookhaven, NY). 120 μl of each of the three different concentrations of MBP alone and HAMP1–5 MBP were used to collect SAXS data. Each sample and the match buffer were exposed to x-rays for 120 s in a quartz flow cell at 15 °C at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. To calibrate the beam intensity at zero angles, SAXS data sets were collected under identical conditions with five samples of hen egg lysozyme in 40 mm NaOAc buffer, pH 3.8, containing 150 mm NaCl at varying predetermined concentrations using absorption at 280 nm (A280(1 mg/ml) = 2.5). Using the Python script-based programs written by Dr. Lin Yang (X9 Beam Line, National Synchrotron Light Source), the images recorded on the CCD were scaled and circularly averaged, and the buffer contribution was subtracted to obtain the scattering intensity (I) as a function of momentum transfer vector, Q(Q = (4π(sinθ)/(λ)); where θ is the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength of the incident beam. All of the SAXS experiments described in this study were carried out in duplicate and the datasets were averaged prior to buffer subtraction and data analysis. Right after exposure to x-rays, the samples were collected in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed later for any degradation. Identical migration pattern between samples that stayed in the laboratory and the ones used for SAXS experiments supported no radiation-based damage. Kratky analysis (I(Q) × Q2 versus Q plot) of the protein samples was carried out to assess the extent of inherent disorder in the scattering particles. Presuming globular nature of scattering species in solution, the Guinier approximation for globular particles was employed to estimate the radius of gyration (Rg) of the scattering particles. According to this approximation, for a monodisperse sample of globular protein, a plot of lnI(Q) versus Q2, where Q × Rg ≤ 1.3, should be linear and fit Equation 1. lnI(Q)=ln[IQ]-(Rg2/3)×Q2(Eq. 1) Here I0 is the intensity of scattering at zero angles and is directly proportional to the product of the molar concentration and the molecular mass of the scattering sample. It cannot be measured directly, but using Guinier approximation, it can be estimated by extrapolating the SAXS data to Q∼0. Similarly the Guinier analysis for rod-like particles was employed to estimate the mean cross-sectional radius of the molecule, RC, given by Equation 2. lnI(Q)Q=ln[I(Q)Q0]-(RC2/2Q2)(Eq. 2) Using estimated Rg and RC values, the length of an ellipsoidal structure, L, can be estimated using the following relationship in Equation 3. L=[12(Rg2-RC2)]12(Eq. 3) In this study, the Guinier analyses were performed using the PRIMUS software package (23Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. PRIMUS: a Windows PC-based system for small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). Using the GNOM45 program, indirect Fourier transformation of the scattering data over the measured Q range computed a pairwise distribution function of inter-atomic vectors, P(r) (24Svergun D.I. Restoring low resolution structure of biological macromolecules from solution scattering using simulated annealing.Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar), shown in Equation 4. P(r)=(12π)∫I(Q)Q×r sin(Q×τ)dQ(Eq. 4) P(r) is essentially a histogram of the frequency of vector lengths connecting small volume elements within the entire volume of the scattering particle. During indirect Fourier transformation, the P(r) was considered as zero for vector lengths equal to 0 and the maximum linear dimension (Dmax). The analyses also provided Rg and I0 values from the second moment and the start of P(r), respectively. Programs available in the ATSAS package were used for SAXS data analysis in this study (25Petoukhov M.V. Konarev P.V. Kikhney A.G. Svergun D.I. ATSAS 2.1-towards automated and web-supported small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: s223-s228Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar). By employing dummy residues and utilizing constraints provided within the experimentally measured SAXS I(Q) profile, the three-dimensional shapes of the proteins were restored using the DAMMIN53 program (24Svergun D.I. Restoring low resolution structure of biological macromolecules from solution scattering using simulated annealing.Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Ten models were generated without any predefined shape or symmetry bias and averaged using the DAMAVER suite of programs (26Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. Uniqueness of ab initio shape determination in small-angle scattering.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1610) Google Scholar) to obtain a shape model that best represents the predominant solution shape of the protein. Alongside, the sequence similarity based model of the full-length structure for HAMP1–5 was generated using the crystal structure of poly-HAMP domains from Pseudomonas aeruginosa soluble receptor Aer2 (PDB code 3LNR) (27Airola M.V. Watts K.J. Bilwes A.M. Crane B.R. Structure of concatenated HAMP domains provides a mechanism for signal transduction.Structure. 2010; 18: 436-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Modeller 9.10 program was used for the homology modeling and ModLoop was used for loop correction (28Eswar N. Webb B. Marti-Renom M.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Eramian D. Shen M.Y. Pieper U. Sali A. Comparative protein structure modeling using MODELLER.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2007; (Chapter 2, Unit 2 9)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sánchez R. Sali A. Comparative protein structure modeling: introduction and practical examples with modeller.Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 143: 97-129PubMed Google Scholar). Gross dimensions of the models were compared with the SAXS data based information. The best fitting model was considered for further refinement. Of the 480 residues in HAMP1–5, only 415 residues could be modeled leaving 55 residues at the N-terminal and 10 residues at the C-terminal. Based on information from MALLS and SAXS, the dimeric HAMP1–5 model was generated, and the coordinates were energy minimized using the Newton program from the Tinker suite of programs to a root mean square deviation gradient cut-off of 0.1 kcal/mol/Å. To understand low frequency motions possible in the structural model of HAMP1–5, normal mode analysis was performed using the ElNemo server (30Suhre K. Sanejouand Y.-H. ElNémo: a normal mode web server for protein movement analysis and the generation of templates for molecular replacement.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W610-W614Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Because normal mode provides directionality to the conformational change, we used a range of perturbation amplitudes to calculate the conformational changes. After finalizing the perturbation to 200 in symmetric manner, similar calculations were done for the mutants, and the same mode was considered for comparison of mutation rendered change in the collective motions. Open source software programs, including PyMOL and SPDB viewer were used for figure generation. Origin5.0 was used for data analysis and graphical representation. DhNik1p contains five canonical HAMP domains (H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5) that are interspersed with four HAMP-like linkers in DhNik1p (H1b, H2b, H3b, and H4b) (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2061053960,"Glutamate receptors are fundamental for control synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal excitability. However, many of the molecular mechanisms underlying their trafficking remain elusive. We previously demonstrated that the small GTPase Rab17 regulates dendritic trafficking in hippocampal neurons. Here, we investigated the role(s) of Rab17 in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) and kainate receptor (KAR) trafficking. Although Rab17 knockdown did not affect surface expression of the AMPAR subunit GluA1 under basal or chemically induced long term potentiation conditions, it significantly reduced surface expression of the KAR subunit GluK2. Rab17 co-localizes with Syntaxin-4 in the soma, dendritic shaft, the tips of developing hippocampal neurons, and in spines. Rab17 knockdown caused Syntaxin-4 redistribution away from dendrites and into axons in developing hippocampal neurons. Syntaxin-4 knockdown reduced GluK2 but had no effect on GluA1 surface expression. Moreover, overexpression of constitutively active Rab17 promoted dendritic surface expression of GluK2 by enhancing Syntaxin-4 translocation to dendrites. These data suggest that Rab17 mediates the dendritic trafficking of Syntaxin-4 to selectively regulate dendritic surface insertion of GluK2-containing KARs in rat hippocampal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2095992341,"We developed a new experimental design to test whether or not individuals engage in conflict between social groups because they seek to harm outgroup members. Challenging prominent social psychological theories, we did not find support for such negative social preferences. Nevertheless, subjects heavily engaged in group conflict. Results support the argument that processes that act within social groups motivate engagement in conflict between groups even in the absence of negative social preferences. In particular, we found that “cheap talk” communication between group members fuels conflict. Analyses did not support the notion that the effect of communication results from guilt-aversion processes."
https://openalex.org/W1964142388,"Animals use dispersed resources within their home range (HR) during regular day-to-day activities. The high-quality area intensively used by an individual, where critical resources are concentrated, has been designated as the core area (CA). This study aimed to describe how animals utilize energy in the HR and CA assuming that changes would occur according to the size of the used areas. We observed energetic costs of space use in the largest European freshwater predator catfish, Silurus glanis, using physiological sensors. Catfish consumed significantly more energy within the CA compared to the rest of the HR area. In addition, energetic costs of space use within a large area were lower. These results generally indicate that utilization of larger areas is related to less demanding activities, such as patrolling and searching for new resources and mates. In contrast, fish occurrence in small areas appears to be related to energetically demanding use of spatially limited resources."
https://openalex.org/W2079712057,"Despite aggressive therapies, including combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma remains a highly aggressive brain cancer with the worst prognosis of any central nervous system disease. We have previously identified a neurofilament-derived cell-penetrating peptide, NFL-TBS.40-63, that specifically enters by endocytosis in glioblastoma cells, where it induces microtubule destruction and inhibits cell proliferation. Here, we explore the impact of NFL-TBS.40-63 peptide on the mitochondrial network and its functions by using global cell respiration, quantitative PCR analysis of the main actors directing mitochondrial biogenesis, western blot analysis of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits and confocal microscopy. We show that the internalized peptide disturbs mitochondrial and microtubule networks, interferes with mitochondrial dynamics and induces a rapid depletion of global cell respiration. This effect may be related to reduced expression of the NRF-1 transcription factor and of specific miRNAs, which may impact mitochondrial biogenesis, in regard to default mitochondrial mobility."
https://openalex.org/W2045599372,"Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been linked to the effects of anti-depressant drugs on behavior in rodent models of depression. To explore this link further, we tested whether the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine impacted adult hippocampal neurogenesis differently than its primary active SNRI metabolite desvenlafaxine. Adult male Long Evans rats (n = 5-6 per group) were fed vehicle, venlafaxine (0.5 or 5 mg) or desvenlafaxine (0.5 or 5 mg) twice daily for 16 days. Beginning the third day of drug treatment, the rats were given a daily bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg) injection for 5 days to label dividing cells and then perfused 2 weeks after the first BrdU injection to confirm total new hippocampal cell numbers and their phenotypes. The high desvenlafaxine dose increased total new BrdU+ cell number and appeared to accelerate neuronal maturation because fewer BrdU+ cells expressed maturing neuronal phenotypes and more expressed mature neuronal phenotypes in the dentate gyri of these versus vehicle-treated rats. While net neurogenesis was not increased in the dentate gyri of rats treated with the high desvenlafaxine dose, significantly more mature neurons were detected. Our data expand the body of literature showing that antidepressants impact adult neurogenesis by stimulating NPC proliferation and perhaps the survival of neuronal progeny and by showing that a high dose of the SNRI antidepressant desvenlafaxine, but neither a high nor low venlafaxine dose, may also accelerate neuronal maturation in the adult rat hippocampus. These data support the hypothesis that hippocampal neurogenesis may indeed serve as a biomarker of depression and the effects of antidepressant treatment, and may be informative for developing novel fast-acting antidepressant strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1984791023,"Mechanistic insights regarding the activity enhancement of dehydrogenase by metal ion substitution were investigated by a simple method using a kinetic and thermodynamic analysis. By profiling the binding energy of both the substrate and product, the metal ion's role in catalysis enhancement was revealed. Glycerol dehydrogenase (GDH) from Klebsiella pneumoniae sp., which demonstrated an improvement in activity by the substitution of a zinc ion with a manganese ion, was used as a model for the mechanistic study of metal ion substitution. A kinetic model based on an ordered Bi-Bi mechanism was proposed considering the noncompetitive product inhibition of dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and the competitive product inhibition of NADH. By obtaining preliminary kinetic parameters of substrate and product inhibition, the number of estimated parameters was reduced from 10 to 4 for a nonlinear regression-based kinetic parameter estimation. The simulated values of time-concentration curves fit the experimental values well, with an average relative error of 11.5% and 12.7% for Mn-GDH and GDH, respectively. A comparison of the binding energy of enzyme ternary complex for Mn-GDH and GDH derived from kinetic parameters indicated that metal ion substitution accelerated the release of dioxyacetone. The metal ion's role in catalysis enhancement was explicated."

The Information Maximization Device (IMD) is established, based on fundamental information-theoretic concepts, and then applied specifically to derive highly resolved phi-psi maps for all 20 single amino acid and all 8000 triplet sequences at an optimal resolution determined by the volume of current data. The paper shows that utilizing the latent information contained in all viable high-resolution crystal structures found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), totaling more than 77,000 chains, permits the derivation of a large number of optimized sequence-dependent PDFs. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the IMD and the superiority of the resulting PDFs by extensive fold recognition experiments and rigorous comparisons with previously published triplet PDFs. Because it automatically optimizes PDFs, IMD results in improved performance of knowledge-based potentials, which rely on such PDFs. Furthermore, it provides an easy computational recipe for empirically deriving other kinds of sequence-dependent structural PDFs with greater detail and precision. The high-resolution phi-psi maps derived in this work are available for download."
https://openalex.org/W2020524488,"A possible method to investigate non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is suggested through finding a Hermitian operator η+ and defining the annihilation and creation operators to be η+ -pseudo-Hermitian adjoint to each other. The operator η+ represents the η+ -pseudo-Hermiticity of Hamiltonians. As an example, a non-Hermitian and non-PT-symmetric Hamiltonian with imaginary linear coordinate and linear momentum terms is constructed and analyzed in detail. The operator η+ is found, based on which, a real spectrum and a positive-definite inner product, together with the probability explanation of wave functions, the orthogonality of eigenstates, and the unitarity of time evolution, are obtained for the non-Hermitian and non-PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. Moreover, this Hamiltonian turns out to be coupled when it is extended to the canonical noncommutative space with noncommutative spatial coordinate operators and noncommutative momentum operators as well. Our method is applicable to the coupled Hamiltonian. Then the first and second order noncommutative corrections of energy levels are calculated, and in particular the reality of energy spectra, the positive-definiteness of inner products, and the related properties (the probability explanation of wave functions, the orthogonality of eigenstates, and the unitarity of time evolution) are found not to be altered by the noncommutativity."
https://openalex.org/W2062080370,"Objects To introduce a new method for generating the clinical target volume (CTV) from gross tumor volume (GTV) using the geodesic distance calculation for glioma. Methods One glioblastoma patient was enrolled. The GTV and natural barriers were contoured on each slice of the computer tomography (CT) simulation images. Then, a graphic processing unit based on a parallel Euclidean distance transform was used to generate the CTV considering natural barriers. Three-dimensional (3D) visualization technique was applied to show the delineation results. Speed of operation and precision were compared between this new delineation method and the traditional method. Results In considering spatial barriers, the shortest distance from the point sheltered from these barriers equals the sum of the distance along the shortest path between the two points; this consists of several segments and evades the spatial barriers, rather than being the direct Euclidean distance between two points. The CTV was generated irregularly rather than as a spherical shape. The time required to generate the CTV was greatly reduced. Moreover, this new method improved inter- and intra-observer variability in defining the CTV. Conclusions Compared with the traditional CTV delineation, this new method using geodesic distance calculation not only greatly shortens the time to modify the CTV, but also has better reproducibility."
