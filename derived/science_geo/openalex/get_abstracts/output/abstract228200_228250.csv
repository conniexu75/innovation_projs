Finding a vaccine for this virus therefore remains a high priority. Here, we show that a DNA vaccine encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV induces T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, as well as protective immunity, in a mouse model. Alternative forms of S were analysed by DNA immunization. These expression vectors induced robust immune responses mediated by CD4 and CD8 cells, as well as significant antibody titres, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, antibody responses in mice vaccinated with an expression vector encoding a form of S that includes its transmembrane domain elicited neutralizing antibodies. Viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid DNA expression vectors, and protection was mediated by a humoral but not a T-cell-dependent immune mechanism. Gene-based vaccination for the SARS-CoV elicits effective immune responses that generate protective immunity in an animal model."

In addition to its cell cycle-regulatory function, Plk1 has a potential role in tumorigenesis. Here we found for the first time that Plk1 physically binds to the tumor suppressor p53 in mammalian cultured cells, and inhibits its transactivation activity as well as its pro-apoptotic function. During the cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, the expression level of Plk1 was significantly decreased both at mRNA and protein levels, whereas cisplatin treatment caused a remarkable stabilization of p53. Systematic immunoprecipitation analyses using a series of deletion mutants of p53 revealed that a sequence-specific DNA-binding region of p53 is required and sufficient for the physical interaction with Plk1. The ectopically overexpressed Plk1 was co-localized with the endogenous p53 in mammalian cell nucleus, as shown by confocal laser microscopy. Expression of exogenous Plk1 and p53 in p53-deficient lung carcinoma H1299 cells greatly decreased the p53-mediated transcription from the p53-responsive p21WAF1, MDM2, and BAX promoters, whereas the kinase-deficient mutant form of Plk1 failed to reduce the transcriptional activity of p53. Consistent with the luciferase reporter analysis, Plk1 had an ability to block the p53-dependent induction of the endogenous p21WAF1. In addition, Plk1 inhibited the pro-apoptotic function of p53 in H1299 cells. Intriguingly, Plk1-mediated repression of p53 was attenuated with ATM. Thus, our present findings strongly suggest that p53 is a critical target of Plk1, and its function is abrogated through the physical interaction with Plk1.

The polo-like kinases (Plks) 1The abbreviations used are: Plk, polo-like kinase; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; GFP, green fluorescence protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NMS, normal mouse serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TK, thymidine kinase; RT, reverse transcriptase. are structurally and functionally related to the Drosophila polo serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase (1Glover D.M.

A high degree of amino acid sequence similarity is detected within a catalytic domain and a unique noncatalytic domain (termed the polo-box) located at the NH2- and COOH-terminal region, respectively (2Clay F.J. McEwen S.J. Bertoncello I. Wilks A.F. Dunn A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the polo-box is critical for the correct subcellular localization of Plks (3Lee K.S. Grenfell T.Z. Yarm F.R. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1984-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence obtained in various experimental systems suggests that Plks play an important role in the regulation of a variety of M-phase-specific events including entry into and exit from mitosis (1Glover D.M.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In addition to their critical role during the G2/M transition, Plks might be also required for G1/S phase transition (9Hamanaka R. Maloid S. Smith M.R. O'Connell C.D. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 249-257PubMed Google Scholar, 10Smith M.R. Wilson M.L. Hamanaka R. Chase D. Kung H.-F. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Plk1 (also referred to as Plk) has been identified as a serine/threonine kinase that displays an extensive amino acid sequence homology to Drosophila polo (2Clay F.J. McEwen S.J. Bertoncello I.

A. 1994; 91: 1736-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), whereas Plk2 (alternatively named Snk) and Plk3 (alternatively termed as proliferation related kinase, Prk) have been originally shown to be transcriptionally induced in response to mitogens (14Simmons D.L. Neel B.G. Stevens R. Evett G. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Guo Y. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10351-10357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In mammalian cultured cells, the amounts of Plk1 mRNA and protein are regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, rising from a very low level in G1 phase to a maximal level during G2/M phase (11Lake R.J. Jelinek W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7793-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Golsteyn R.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Ziemiecki A. Ried T. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase activity of Plk1 is regulated by its phosphorylation and peaks at M phase (16Golsteyn R.M. Mundt K.E. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J.

Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the kinase activity of Plk1 is inhibited in response to DNA damage in mammalian cultured cells and this inhibition occurs in an ATM-dependent manner (19Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 20van Vugt M.A.T.M. Smits V.A.J. Klompmaker R. Medema R.H. J.

At the onset of mitosis, Plk1 phosphorylated cyclin B1 and promoted rapid nuclear translocation of an active Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex (21Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Shinya N. Iwamatsu A. Nishida E. Nature. 2001; 410: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 22Yuan J. Eckerdt F. Bereiter-Hahn J. Kurunci-Csacsko E. Kaufmann M. Strebhardt K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8282-8292Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, Toyoshima-Morimoto et al. (23Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) has found that, during G2/M phase, Plk1 is capable of phosphorylating Cdc25C, which dephosphorylates and directly activates the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex, and regulating the nuclear entry of Cdc25C. In contrast to Plk1, the expression level of Plk3 remains constant during the cell cycle progression and its kinase activity peaks during late S and G2 phase (24Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J.

In addition to the potential cell cycle-regulatory role, Plk1 has been implicated in the genesis and/or progression of tumors. Plk1 was overexpressed in rapidly proliferating cells as well as various human primary tumors (27Yuan J. Horlin A. Hock B. Stutte H.J. Rubsamen-Waigmann H. Strebhardt K. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1165-1172PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the expression level of Plk1 is tightly linked to proliferation and could be used as a negative prognostic indicator for various tumors (28Wolf G. Elez R. Doermer A. Holtrich U. Ackermann H. Stutte H.J. Altmannsberger H.M. Rubsamen-Waigmann H. Strebhardt K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 29Knecht R.

Cancer. 2000; 89: 535-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, constitutive overexpression of Plk1 in NIH3T3 cells resulted in the oncogenic focus formation and induction of tumor growth in nude mice (10Smith M.R. Wilson M.L. Hamanaka R. Chase D. Kung H.-F. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of the endogenous Plk1 by using several antisense oligonucleotides targeted to Plk1 induced growth inhibition in certain cancerous cells (31Spankuch-Schmitt B. Wolf G. Solbach C. Loibl S. Knecht R. Stegmuller M. von Minckwitz G. Kaufmann M. Strebhardt K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3162-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Additionally, treatment of the cells with small interfering RNA targeted against Plk1 caused the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (32Spankuch-Schmitt B. Bereiter-Hahn J. Kaufmann M. Strebhardt K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 1863-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 33Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5789-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Of note, Liu and Erikson (33Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5789-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) reported that the tumor suppressor p53 might be involved in the Plk1 depletion-induced apoptosis. Recently, Plk1 has also been reported to have an ability to phosphorylate p53 in vitro, however, it is still unknown whether there exists a functional association between Plk1 and p53 (26Xie S. Wu H. Wang Q. Cogswell J.P. Husain I. Conn C. Stambrook P. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43305-43312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to Plk1, the expression level of Plk3 was significantly down-regulated in several human primary tumors including lung carcinomas and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, as compared with their corresponding normal tissues (34Li B. Ouyang B. Pan H. Reissmann P.T. Slamon D.J. Arceci R. Lu L. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19402-19408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 35Dai W. Li Y. Ouyang B.

Overexpression of Plk3 in mammalian cultured cells inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis (36Conn C.W. Hennigan R.F. Dai W. Sanchez Y. Stambrook P.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6826-6831PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that Plk3 physically interacts with p53 and phosphorylates the Ser20 of p53, which might result in the enhancement of its activity. These suggest that Plk1 and Plk3 play a differential role in regulating cell proliferation and oncogenesis, and that p53 participates in Plk3-dependent growth inhibition and/or apoptosis (25Bahassi E.M. Conn C.W. Myer D.L. Hennigan R.F. McGowan C.H. Sanchez Y. Stambrook P.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6633-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26Xie S. Wu H. Wang Q. Cogswell J.P. Husain I.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36194-36199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the physical and functional interaction between Plk1 and p53. We found that Plk1 binds to the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain of p53, and inhibits the p53-dependent transcriptional activation as well as pro-apoptotic function. Intriguingly, overexpression of ATM abrogated the Plk1-mediated inhibitory effect on p53. These results suggest that the Plk1-mediated negative regulation of p53 might be a fundamental mechanism for the Plk1-induced oncogenesis. Tumor Samples—Surgically resected tumor tissues including three lung adenocarcinomas, two gastric adenocarcinomas, one uterus carcinoma, two bladder carcinomas, and their corresponding normal tissues used in this study were obtained as frozen specimens from the Tissue Bank in Chiba Cancer Center Hospital (Chiba, Japan). Six hepatoblastomas and their matched normal tissues were provided by the Japanese Study Group for Pediatric Liver Tumor. Cell Culture—African green monkey kidney COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin (100 IU/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and human lung carcinoma H1299 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotic mixture. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Transfection—COS7 cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) in a 6-cm diameter culture dish in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. Transfection of H1299 cells was conducted by lipofection with LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in a 12-well plate according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from SH-SY5Y cells exposed to cisplatin by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and subjected to synthesis of the first strand cDNA with random primers and a SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 1 h. When the reaction was complete, the cDNA was amplified in a final volume of 15 μl of reaction mixture containing 100 μm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1× PCR buffer, 1 μm of each primer, and 0.2 units of rTaq DNA polymerase (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan). The primers for p53 amplification were 5′-ATTTGATGCTGTCCCCGGACGATATTGAAC-3′ and 5′-ACCCTTTTTGGACTTCAGGTGGCTGGAGTG-3′. The primers for p21WAF1 amplification were 5′-ATGAAATTCACCCCCTTTCC-3′ and 5′-CCCTAGGCTGTGCTCACTTC-3′. The primers for Plk1 amplification were 5′-ATCACCTGCCTGACCATTCCACCAAGG-3′ and 5′-AATTGCGGAAATATTTAAGGAGGGTGATCT-3′. The primers for Plk3 amplification were 5′-GCGCGAGAAGATCCTAAATG-3′ and 5′-GATCTGCCGCAGGTAGTAGC-3′. The primers for GAPDH amplification were 5′-ACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGAA-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. The PCR-amplified products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide post-staining. Generation of FLAG-tagged Expression Constructs—The FLAG-tagged human Plk1 construct was generated by PCR amplification using the cDNA derived from primary hepatoblastoma as a template. The forward and reverse primers used in the PCR were 5′-CCGCTCGAGAGTGCTGCAGTGACTGCAGGGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGTCTAGATTAGGAGGCCTTGAGACGGTTGCT-3′. The underlined nucleotides represent the XhoI restriction sites in the forward primer and the XbaI restriction site in the reverse primer. The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and its nucleotide sequence was verified by automated dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and XbaI, and inserted between the XhoI to XbaI sites in the pcDNA3-FLAG expression plasmid in-frame to the downstream of the FLAG tag to give pcDNA3-FLAG-Plk1. Construction of the Deletion Mutants of p53 and Plk1—The p53 deletion mutants, p53-(1–359), p53-(1–292), and p53-(1–101) were generated by using the forward primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTC-3′ (1F) in combination with the reverse primers 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGTCATGGCTCCTTCCCAGCCTGGGCATCCTT-3′ (359R), 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGTCATTTCTTGCGGAGATTCTCTTCCTCTGT-3′ (292R) and 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGTCATTTCTGGGAAGGGACAGAAGATGACA-3′ (101R), respectively. p53-(102–393) was amplified by using the forward primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGATGACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACGGTTTCCGTCT-3′ (102F) and the reverse primer 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGTCAGTCTGAGTCAGGCCCTTCTGTCTTGAACAT-3′ (393R). Each of the forward and reverse primers contained the HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites to facilitate the subsequent cloning step. Underlined nucleotides in the oligonucleotides listed above were HindIII or EcoRI sites. Amplified fragments were digested with HindIII and EcoRI, and subcloned directly into the identical restriction sites of pcDNA3 to give pcDNA3-p53-(1–359), pcDNA3-p53-(1–292), pcDNA3-p53-(1–101), and pcDNA3-p53-(102–393). All of the constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. For the construction of the deletion mutants of Plk1, pcDNA3-FLAG-Plk1 was digested with BamHI, BamHI and BstXI, or BamHI and NcoI. A restriction fragment encoding amino acid residues 1–401, 1–329, or 1–98 was purified from agarose gels, filled in the overhangs with Klenow, and then inserted in-frame into the enzymatically modified BamHI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3-FLAG expression plasmid to give pcDNA3-FLAG-Plk1-(1–401), pcDNA3-FLAG-Plk1-(1–329), or pcDNA3-FLAG-Plk1-(1–98), respectively. DNA sequencing confirmed the authenticity of the expression plasmids prior to transfection. Construction of the Kinase-deficient Mutant Form of Plk1—The K82M mutation was introduced into wild-type Plk1 by the PCR-based strategy using PfuUltra™ High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-ATGATTGTGCCTAAGTCTCTGCTGCTCAAGCCGCA-3′ (underlined segment encodes Met at amino acid position 82) and 5′-GCCCGCGAACACCTCCTTGGTGTCCGCGTCCGAGA-3′. Nucleic acid sequencing was performed to verify the presence of the desired mutation and absence of random mutations. The amplified fragment that contains the K82M mutation was then digested with HindIII and NcoI, gel-purified, and ligated with the NcoI/XbaI restriction fragment containing the 3′-portion of the wild-type Plk1 cDNA. The resulting entire cDNA encoding the full-length Plk1 carrying the amino acid substitution at position 82 was inserted in-frame into the HindIII and XbaI sites of the pcDNA3-FLAG expression plasmid to give pcDNA3-FLAG-Plk1(K82M). Construction of the Expression Plasmid for Antisense Plk1—A full-length human Plk1 cDNA was ligated into the pcDNA3 expression plasmid in a reverse orientation to give As-Plk1, and the product was evaluated by restriction digestion. To assess the effect of As-Plk1 on the endogenous Plk1, whole cell lysates prepared from H1299 cells transfected with As-Plk1 were analyzed for Plk1 by immunoblotting. GST Pull-down Assay—Whole cell lysates prepared from COS7 cells expressing FLAG-Plk1 were incubated with 1 μg of GST or GST-p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with NETN buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The bound proteins were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer by boiling for 5 min, and separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. Immunofluorescent Labeling and Confocal Microscopy—COS7 cells, cultured onto glass coverslips, were transiently transfected with the expression plasmid for FLAG-Plk1. Transfected cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and then fixed with 1× PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with 1× PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature and blocked for 1 h in 1× PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated with polyclonal anti-p53 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) and monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with primary antibodies, cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) diluted 1:200 for 1 h at room temperature. Cell nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml (Sigma). Cells were finally washed with 1× PBS, the coverslips were removed from the dishes, mounted onto slides, and observed under Fluoview laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of the expression plasmids. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were extracted directly with the lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and the whole cell lysates were sonicated for 10 s followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble materials. The protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay according to the instructions of the vendor (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of the whole cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were boiled in an SDS sample buffer consisting of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue and subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and then electrotransferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were blocked with TBS-T (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature for 1 h, and subsequently incubated for 1 h with monoclonal anti-Plk1 (PL2 and PL6, Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA), monoclonal anti-p53 (DO-1, Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA), monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma), monoclonal anti-Plk3 antibody (B37–2, BD Pharmingen), polyclonal antibody specific for p53 phosphorylated at Ser15 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), polyclonal anti-p21WAF1 antibody (H-164, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), or polyclonal anti-actin antibody (20–33, Sigma) in TBS-T, followed by an incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted at 1:2,000 for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed extensively with TBS-T and protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions as described previously (38Nakamura Y. Ozaki T. Nakagawara A. Sakiyama S. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 1986-1990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS and lysed in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to collect the soluble fraction as cytosolic extracts. Insoluble materials were washed with the lysis buffer and further dissolved in 1× SDS sample buffer to collect the nuclear fraction. The nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis using the anti-FLAG, monoclonal anti-lamin B (Ab-1, Oncogene Research Products), or monoclonal anti-Ras (RASK-3, Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) antibody. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For the immunoprecipitation of Plk1 and p53, COS7 cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of the expression plasmid for FLAG-Plk1 using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed by incubation with mixing in 400 μl of the EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 30 min. Whole cell lysates were then subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble materials. Equal amounts of whole cell lysates were precleared with 30 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with the normal mouse serum (NMS), monoclonal anti-FLAG, or monoclonal anti-p53 antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with the protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 30 min, which were then pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The precipitates were washed with the lysis buffer three times at 4 °C, resuspended in 30 μl of the SDS sample buffer, and treated at 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins were then resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto the Immobilon-P membranes. The protein complex was detected by Western blot analysis using the monoclonal anti-FLAG or monoclonal anti-p53 antibodies. Luciferase Reporter Assays—p53-deficient H1299 cells were seeded in a 12-well tissue culture dish at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. Cells were transfected with 100 ng of the p53-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid (p21, MDM2, or BAX), 10 ng of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase cDNA, and 25 ng of the expression plasmid for p53 together with or without increasing amounts of FLAG-Plk1 expression plasmid. The total amount of DNA was kept constant (510 ng) with pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) per transfection. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, transfected cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, and resuspended in passive lysis buffer (Promega Corp.). Both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed with the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fluorescent light emission was determined by TD-20 luminometer (Turner Design, Sunnylvale, CA). The firefly luminescence signal was normalized based on the Renilla luminescence signal. The results were obtained from at least three sets of transfection and were presented as the mean ± S.D. Cell Survival Assays—Cell viability was determined by a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In brief, SH-SY5Y cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates (5 × 103 cell/well) with 100 μl of complete medium and allowed to attach. The next day, the medium were changed and cells were treated with cisplatin for 24 h. For the MTT assay, 10 μl of MTT solution was added to each well for 3 h at 37 °C. The absorbance readings for each well were carried out at"
https://openalex.org/W2041680957,"The subcellular distribution of Met and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) metabolism in plant cells discloses a complex partition between the cytosol and the organelles. In the present work we show that Arabidopsis contains three functional isoforms of vitamin B12-independent methionine synthase (MS), the enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of homocysteine to Met with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as methyl group donor. One MS isoform is present in chloroplasts and is most likely required to methylate homocysteine that is synthesized de novo in this compartment. Thus, chloroplasts are autonomous and are the unique site for de novo Met synthesis in plant cells. The additional MS isoforms are present in the cytosol and are most probably involved in the regeneration of Met from homocysteine produced in the course of the activated methyl cycle. Although Met synthesis can occur in chloroplasts, there is no evidence that AdoMet is synthesized anywhere but the cytosol. In accordance with this proposal, we show that AdoMet is transported into chloroplasts by a carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion process. This carrier is able to catalyze the uniport uptake of AdoMet into chloroplasts as well as the exchange between cytosolic AdoMet and chloroplastic AdoMet or S-adenosylhomocysteine. The obvious function for the carrier is to sustain methylation reactions and other AdoMet-dependent functions in chloroplasts and probably to remove S-adenosylhomocysteine generated in the stroma by methyltransferase activities. Therefore, the chloroplastic AdoMet carrier serves as a link between cytosolic and chloroplastic one-carbon metabolism. The subcellular distribution of Met and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) metabolism in plant cells discloses a complex partition between the cytosol and the organelles.

The sulfur-containing amino acid Met is essential in all organisms as a building block of proteins and as a component of the universal activated methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; Hcy, homocysteine; 5-CH3-H4PteGlun, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; MS, methionine synthase; AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine; chl, chlorophyll; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; RT, reverse transcriptase. By using the aquatic plant Lemna pausicostata, Giovanelli et al. (1Giovanelli J. Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1985; 78: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have shown that the synthesis of AdoMet accounts for ∼80% of Met metabolism, whereas the synthesis of proteins (the only pathway consuming the entire Met molecule) drives ∼20% of Met. More than 90% of AdoMet is then used for transmethylation, leading to nucleic acid, protein, lipid, and other metabolite modifications (1Giovanelli J. Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1985; 78: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Utilization of the methyl group of AdoMet in transmethylation is accompanied by recycling of the homocysteinyl moiety and regeneration of Met, a set of reactions designated as the activated methyl cycle. Most of the genes and enzymes involved in Met and AdoMet synthesis and metabolism have been characterized in plants (for reviews see Ref. 2Ravanel S. Gakière B. Job D. Douce R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7805-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 3Hanson A.D. Roje S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

One of the most intriguing findings is the complex subcellular distribution of these metabolic routes. The first two reactions specific for de novo Met synthesis consist of the conversion of cysteine into homocysteine (Hcy) by the enzymes cystathionine γ-synthase and cystathionine β-lyase. Both enzymes are present only in the chloroplasts (2Ravanel S. Gakière B. Job D. Douce R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7805-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Hcy is then methylated to Met by transfer of the methyl group of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3-H4PteGlun), a reaction catalyzed by methionine synthase (MS). There are two types of MS, a cobalamin-dependent enzyme that contains a vitamin B12 cofactor and a cobalamin-independent isoenzyme (5Gonzalez J.C. Banerjee R.V. Huang S. Sumner J.S. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6045-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To date, only the cobalamin-independent MS activity has been described in higher plants (6Eichel J. Gonzalez J.C. Hotze M. Matthews R.G. Schroder J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Gakière B. Job D. Douce R. Ravanel S.

Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 48: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although cobalamin-dependent enzymes also occur in the photosynthetic protist Euglena gracilis (10Isegawa Y. Watanabe F. Kitaoka S. Nakano Y. Phytochemistry. 1994; 35: 59-61Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Plant MS seems to be present only in the cytosol (6Eichel J. Gonzalez J.C. Hotze M. Matthews R.G. Schroder J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Gakière B. Job D. Douce R. Ravanel S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 1206Google Scholar, 8Eckermann C. Eichel J.

Biol. 2002; 48: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), thus implying that Hcy originating from cysteine has to exit the chloroplast to be converted to Met. MS not only catalyzes the last reaction in de novo Met synthesis but also serves to regenerate the methyl group of AdoMet after methylation reactions. In plants as in other eukaryotes, the two other enzymes participating in the activated methyl cycle, namely AdoMet synthetase and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase, are most probably present exclusively in the cytosol (2Ravanel S. Gakière B. Job D. Douce R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7805-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 3Hanson A.D. Roje S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 11Schröder G. Eichel J. Breinig S. Schroder J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As a consequence, it is usually considered that chloroplasts and mitochondria must import AdoMet from the cytosol, principally to fulfill methylation reactions. Also, because AdoHcy produced during methylation reactions is a potent competitive inhibitor of methyltransferases, it is assumed that chloroplasts and mitochondria have to export AdoHcy to the cytosol to maintain the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio that regulates methyltransferase activities (for a review see Ref. 12Moffatt B.A. Weretilnyk E.A. Physiol. Plant. 2001; 113: 435-442Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In support of these statements, mitochondria isolated from rat liver were found to transport AdoMet from the cytosol via a carrier-mediated system that is inhibited by AdoHcy (13Horne D.W. Holloway R.S. Wagner C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, mitochondrial carriers capable of exchanging cytosolic AdoMet for mitochondrial AdoHcy were cloned and characterized in yeast (14Marobbio C.M. Agrimi G. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5975-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and human (15Agrimi G. Di Noia M.A. Marobbio C.M. Fiermonte G. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Such a transport system has never been described for plant mitochondria or plastids. The aim of the present work was to explore the role of chloroplasts in relation to Met and AdoMet metabolism. First, we have shown the existence of a cobalamin-independent MS in the plastids, thus rendering this compartment autonomous for de novo Met synthesis from its precursors cysteine, aspartate, and 5-CH3-H4PteGlun. In Arabidopsis, two additional isoforms of B12-independent MS are present in the cytosol and are most probably devoted to the recycling of Met in the course of the activated methyl cycle. Second, we found that AdoMet is transported from the cytosol to chloroplasts by a carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion process. Besides the uniport uptake of AdoMet, the carrier can catalyze the exchange between cytosolic AdoMet and chloroplastic AdoMet or AdoHcy, thus suggesting that it can be involved in the prevention of AdoHcy accumulation in the stroma. Plant Material—Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Wassilewskija) plants were grown in soil under greenhouse conditions (23 °C with a 16-h photoperiod and a light intensity of 200 μmol of photons m-2 s-1) until harvested for analysis. A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) cell suspension cultures were grown under continuous white light (40 μmol of photons m-2 s-1) at 23 °C with rotary agitation at 125 rpm in Gamborg's B5 medium supplemented with 1 μm 2-naphthalene acetic acid and 1.5% (w/v) sucrose. Pea (Pisum sativum L. var. Douce Provence) plants were grown for 9 days under a 12-h photoperiod (140 μmol of photons m-2 s-1) at 22 °C (day) and 20 °C (night). Etiolated pea plants were grown in complete darkness at 20 °C, and leaves were collected under a green safelight. Freshly harvested spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves were obtained from a local grower and stored at 4 °C until required for use. Chemicals—(6R,6S)-5-Methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteroyl-l-glutamatic acid (5-CH3-H4PteGlu1) and l-homocysteine thiolactone were obtained from Sigma. Pteroylpenta-γ-glutamic acid was purchased from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). [carboxyl-14C]AdoMet (2.18 GBq mmol-1 in 0.2 m H2SO4, Amersham Biosciences) was mixed with AdoMet (p-toluene sulfonate salt, Sigma) and neutralized with BaCO3 as described by Teyssier et al. (16Teyssier E. Block M.A. Douce R. Joyard J. Plant J. 1996; 10: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cloning of AtMS1-3 cDNAs—Poly(A)+ mRNAs were isolated from above-ground parts of 3-week old A. thaliana plants and used to construct a Marathon™ cDNA amplification library (17Ravanel S. Cherest H.

Full-length cDNAs were generated by PCR using primers overlapping the region containing the initiation Met codon and the 3′-untranslated region of each gene (Table I). Amplification was done with the Pfu DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). PCR products were subcloned into the pBluescriptII KS vector digested with SmaI and sequenced (GenomeExpress, Meylan, France). The cloned sequences were designated AtMS1, -2, and -3 for A. thaliana methionine synthase homologs.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotides used in this studyPrimersSequences (5′ → 3′)cDNA cloningMS1-5′GAGAATTCTCAAAATGGCTTCACACATTGTMS1-3′GAGACTGCAGCCTTGTTCAAATCAAGCTTTTCMS2-5′GAGAATTCCAAAAATGGCTTCCCACATTGMS2-3′GAGACTGCAGTATAGAAATAATATCTTCAAGCTCMS3-5′AGACCCGGGAATGGGTCAGCTCGCTCTTCMS3-3′GAGACTGCAGGAGGAAACTTACTTGAGGAAAGpET23d cloningMS1-pET5′GAGATCATGAGTTCACACATTGTTGGATACCCMS1-pET3′GAGAGAATTCTTCACTTGGCACTGGCGMS2-pET5′GAGATCATGAGTTCCCACATTGTTGGATATCCMS2-pET3′GAGAGAATTCTTCACTTGGCACTACCGAGMS3-pETM49GAGATCATGAGTTCCCACATCGTTGGGTATCCMS3-pET3′GAGACTCGAGTTTATGACTTATTTAGCTGAGAGCGp35ο-sGFP(S65T) cloningMS1GFP5′GAGAGAGTCGACAATGGCTTCACACATTGTTGGMS1GFP3′GAGAGATCATGAGTTCAGCATAGGCACCAGTAMS2GFP5′GAGAGAGTCGACAAATGGCTTCCCACATTGTTGMS2GFP3′GAGAGATCATGAGCTCAGCATAGGCACCGCMS3GFP5′GAGAGAGTCGACAATGGGTCAGCTCGCTCTTCMS3GFP3′GAGAGATCATGAGAGAGTACGCATCGGAAAATGReal time PCRMS1-ACTGTGGTCTCAAGACCCGTMS1-BCCTTGTTCAAATCAAGCTTTTCMS2-AACTGTGGTCTGAAGACAAGGMS2-BTATAGAAATAATATCTTCAAGCTCMS3-CCTCAGAAAATCCGAGCAAAAGMS3-DCCTTCATGGAAGACTGATAAGActin-5′GTTTTGCTGGGGATGATGCACCActin-3′CGTTTGGATTGAGCTTCATCGCC Open table in a new tab Expression of AtMS Proteins in Escherichia coli—The coding sequences of the AtMS cDNAs were amplified from pBluescript plasmid templates by high fidelity PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase and primers listed in Table I. For overexpression of AtMS1 and AtMS2, the full-length coding sequences were amplified, digested with BspHI and EcoRI, and inserted between the NcoI and EcoRI sites of pET-23d (Novagen) to give plasmids pET-MS1 and pET-MS2. To express AtMS3 in E. coli, the targeting region was removed so that the initiation codon of the recombinant protein was Met-49. The resulting truncated cDNA was digested with BspHI and XhoI and cloned between the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET-23d to give plasmid pET-MS3. The pET-MS constructs were introduced first into E. coli DH5α and then into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Stratagene). Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing carbenicillin (100 μg ml-1), chloramphenicol (34 μg ml-1), and 0.5 mm ZnSO4 until A600 reached 0.6. Isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside was added (final concentration 0.5 mm), and the cells were further grown for 4 h at 28 °C (AtMS1), 16 h at 28 °C (AtMS2), or 16 h at 16 °C (AtMS3). Subsequent operations were done at 4 °C. Cells were pelleted (4,000 × g, 20 min), resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (catalog number 1873580, Roche Applied Science), and disrupted by sonication (Sonifier 250, Branson). The soluble protein extracts were separated from the cell debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min and desalted on PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. Measurement of Cobalamin-independent MS Activity—Cobalamin-independent MS was assayed using unlabeled 5-CH3-H4PteGlun as a substrate, the reaction product tetrahydrofolate being detected spectrophotometrically following its conversion to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate by heating with formic acid (18Drummond J.T. Jarrett J. Gonzalez J.C. Huang S. Matthews R.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The standard assays contained, in a final volume of 400 μl, 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm Hcy, 150 μm (6R,6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 or (6R,6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu1, and desalted protein extracts. The reaction was initiated by the addition of Hcy and incubated at 30 °C for 4-30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 5 n HCl, 60% (v/v) formic acid and heating for 14 min at 84 °C. After equilibration at room temperature, the assays were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min to remove precipitated proteins. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 350 nm, and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate was quantified using an absorption coefficient of 26,500 m-1 cm-1 (18Drummond J.T. Jarrett J. Gonzalez J.C. Huang S. Matthews R.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The l-Hcy stock solution was prepared by hydrolysis of the l-Hcy thiolactone, and the actual concentration was determined by titration with 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (18Drummond J.T. Jarrett J. Gonzalez J.C. Huang S. Matthews R.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). (6R,6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 was prepared from pteroylpenta-γ-glutamic acid as described by Yeo and Wagner (19Yeo E.J. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24669-24674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5-CH3-H4PteGlun substrates were prepared as 5 mm solutions in 10 mm sodium ascorbate and manipulated under a stream of argon in order to protect them from oxidation. Isolation of Chloroplasts, Mitochondria, and a Cytosolic-enriched Fraction from Arabidopsis—Chloroplasts from A. thaliana leaves were purified on Percoll™ (Amersham Biosciences) gradients as described by Awai et al. (20Awai K. Marechal E. Block M.A. Brun D. Masuda T. Shimada H. Takamiya K. Ohta H. Joyard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10960-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Intact chloroplasts were lysed in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.6, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm aminocaproic acid. Chloroplast sub-fractions were separated on a step gradient of 0.93 to 0.6 m sucrose in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.6, by centrifugation at 70,000 × g for 1 h. The soluble fraction (stroma) was collected at the top of the 0.6 m sucrose layer. Mitochondria were prepared from 6-day-old Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures using the procedure described by Ravanel et al. (17Ravanel S. Cherest H. Jabrin S. Grunwald D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Douce R. Rébeillé F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15360-15365Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Crude mitochondria were layered on discontinuous gradients consisting of 18, 23, and 40% Percoll layers in 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Gradients were centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 40 min and mitochondria collected at the 23:40% Percoll interface. In order to obtain soluble proteins (matrix), purified mitochondria were lysed by a 10-fold dilution in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm aminocaproic acid and submitted to three freeze-thaw cycles. Membranes were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Cytosolic enriched fractions were prepared from Arabidopsis protoplasts obtained by enzymatic digestion of 6-day-old cell suspension cultures using the procedure described by Ravanel et al. (17Ravanel S. Cherest H. Jabrin S. Grunwald D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Douce R. Rébeillé F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15360-15365Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, protoplasts were gently ruptured by passing through a 20-μm nylon mesh and subsequently through a 10-μm nylon mesh. The protoplast lysate was centrifuged successively at 100 × g for 5 min, 900 × g for 5 min, and 13,000 × g for 20 min. The 13,000 × g supernatant fraction, which is enriched in the cytosolic marker activity and contains a small part of mitochondrial and chloroplastic marker enzymes (17Ravanel S. Cherest H. Jabrin S.

Isolation of Plastids and Mitochondria from Pea Leaves—For the preparation of plastids and mitochondria, green or etiolated leaves were collected from 9-day-old seedlings. Mitochondria from green leaves were isolated and purified as described by Douce et al. (21Douce R. Bourguignon J. Brouquisse R. Neuburger M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 403-415Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar) by using two steps of purification on Percoll/polyvinylpyrrolidone gradient. Mitochondria from etiolated leaves were isolated using the procedure described for potato tuber mitochondria with one step of purification on a Percoll gradient (21Douce R. Bourguignon J. Brouquisse R. Neuburger M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 403-415Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts were isolated and purified on a continuous Percoll gradient as described by Douce and Joyard (22Douce R. Joyard J. Eldman M. Hallick R. Chua N.H. Method in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1982: 239-256Google Scholar). Etioplasts were purified from etiolated pea leaves as described by Jabrin et al. (23Jabrin S. Ravanel S. Gambonnet B. Douce R. Rébeillé F. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) by using a preformed 30-80% (v/v) Percoll density gradient. Soluble proteins were obtained from the purified pea organelles after osmotic lysis and centrifugation, as described for the Arabidopsis subcellular fractions. Antibody Production and Immunoblot Analysis—The AtMS1 protein fused to maltose-binding protein was purified by affinity chromatography and injected into guinea pigs to raise antibodies (7Gakière B. Job D. Douce R. Ravanel S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 1206Google Scholar). Total soluble proteins from Arabidopsis and pea leaves were extracted by grinding powdered samples in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm aminocaproic acid. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as a source of soluble proteins. Proteins were measured by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Proteins from Arabidopsis or pea fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were probed using the AtMS1 antibodies (dilution 1:3000), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgGs, and detection was achieved by chemiluminescence. Transient Expression of GFP Fusion Proteins in Arabidopsis Protoplasts—The GFP reporter plasmid 35Ω-sGFP(S65T) expressing an engineered version of the green fluorescent protein under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (25Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar) was used for transient expression experiments in Arabidopsis protoplasts. The N-terminal regions of the AtMS1, -2, and -3 proteins fused upstream and in-frame with sGFP(S65T) contained 229, 229 and 275 residues, respectively. These regions were PCR-amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase and specific flanking primers listed in Table I. The PCR products were digested with SalI and BspHI and inserted between the SalI and NcoI sites of p35Ω-sGFP(S65T) to give plasmids pGFP-MS1, pGFP-MS2, and pGFP-MS3. Arabidopsis protoplasts prepared from a 4-day-old cell suspension culture were transformed essentially as described by Abel and Theologis (26Abel S. Theologis A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). For each transformation 300 μl of protoplasts (∼2 × 106 cells) were mixed with 20-30 μg of plasmid DNA, 50 μg of salmon sperm carrier DNA, and 350 μl of polyethylene glycol solution (0.4 m mannitol, 0.1 m CaNO3, 40% (w/v) PEG-4000), and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Protoplasts were cultured in 3 ml of medium (0.4 m sucrose, Murashige and Skoog basal medium, 4 mm CaCl2, and 250 mg l-1 xylose) under dim light at 22 °C for up to 48 h. Samples were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan2 fluorescence microscope, and the images were captured with a digital charge-coupled devices camera (Hamamatsu). The filter sets used were Zeiss filter set 13, 488013-0000 (exciter BP 470/20, beamsplitter FT 493, emitter BP 505-530, and Zeiss filter set 15, 488015-0000 (exciter BP 546/12, beamsplitter FT 580, emitter LP 590) for GFP and chlorophyll fluorescence, respectively. Real Time PCR—Relative quantification of atms1, atms2, and atms3 mRNAs was done by real time PCR using Lightcycler System (Roche Applied Science) and Lightcycler-Faststart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit. Poly(A) mRNAs from different organs (leaves, stems, roots, flowers, siliques, and seeds) of Arabidopsis were prepared using Straight A's™ mRNA Isolation System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of mRNA in a final volume of 20 μl using oligo(dT)20 primers (Thermoscript RT-PCR System, Invitrogen). For each real time PCR experiment, 5 μl of DNA preparation was used as a template in a standard 10-μl LightCycler PCR with appropriate primers (Table I) used at a final concentration of 1 μm and 3 mm MgCl2. Amplification and detection were performed using the following profile: 95 °C for 8 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 66 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 8 s. Data were analyzed with the LightCycler Relative Quantification software (Roche Applied Science) using the amplification of actin cDNA (GenBank™ accession number U39449, primers listed in Table I) as internal standard of mRNA integrity and cDNA preparation. The specificity of the reaction was verified by melting curve analysis obtained by increasing temperature from 55 to 95 °C (0.1 °C/s). Measurement of AdoMet Uptake by Intact Chloroplasts—Uptake of AdoMet was measured by silicone oil-filtering centrifugation (27Heldt H.W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 604-612Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using spinach leaf chloroplasts purified according to Mourioux and Douce (28Mourioux G. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 470-473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intactness of the chloroplasts was tested by using an oxygen electrode and was found to be close to 95%. Chlorophyll (chl) content was determined as described by Bruinsma (29Bruinsma J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 52: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Polypropylene tubes (0.4 ml) were filled with 20 μl of 1 m HClO4, 70 μl of AR200 silicone oil (Wacker-Chemie GmbH, Munich, Germany), and 140 μl of medium A (0.33 m sorbitol, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2) containing various concentrations of the radiolabeled substrate. Uptake was started by addition of 10 μl of freshly prepared chloroplasts (80-100 μg of chl/assay) using a small plastic spatula to achieve rapid dispersion of the chloroplasts in the medium. After incubation for 10-500 s at 25 °C under low light conditions, uptake was stopped by centrifuging the tubes at 3,000 × g for 2 min (swinging bucket, Kubota KM-15200 microcentrifuge). An aliquot of the supernatant was taken for determination of the substrate-specific radioactivity, and a 10-μl aliquot of the HClO4 phase was taken for determination of radioactivity incorporated into chloroplasts. The kinetics of AdoMet uptake were fitted to a single exponential by using Equation 1, where At and Aeq are the amount of AdoMet incorporated in the chloroplasts at time t and at the equilibrium, and kobs is the pseudo-first order rate constant. At=Aeq(1−exp(−kobst))(Eq. 1) To analyze AdoMet/AdoHcy counter-exchanges across the chloroplast envelope, freshly prepared chloroplasts were loaded with AdoMet or AdoHcy by incubation in the dark with 100 μm unlabeled substrates for 10 min at room temperature. The chloroplasts were quickly cooled down on ice for 10 min and then washed twice by dilution with ice-cold medium A and centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 3 min. The pelleted chloroplasts were gently resuspended in medium A and analyzed for their ability to import 100 μm [carboxyl-14C]AdoMet, as described above. For back-exchange experiments, chloroplasts were loaded with 100 μm [carboxyl-14C]AdoMet for 10 min at 25 °C, cooled down on ice for 10 min, and then washed twice in ice-cold medium A. Back-exchange was measured by incubating 10 μl of [carboxyl-14C]AdoMet-loaded chloroplasts in 140 μl of medium A containing either unlabeled AdoHcy or AdoMet (each at 100 μm). The efflux of [carboxyl-14C]AdoMet was followed by silicone oil-filtering centrifugation as described above. Measurement of AdoMet and AdoHcy—Intact chloroplasts (50-70 mg chl) were lysed in 2 ml of distilled water and centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 × g and 4 °C to remove membrane systems. AdoMet and AdoHcy present in the supernatant were separated from other nucleotides by ion-paired high pressure liquid chromatography using a reversed phase UP3HDO-15 M column (3-μm particle size; Interchim) and quantified using a photodiode array detector (Waters). AdoMet and AdoHcy were identified by co-elution with authentic standards and diode array analysis of UV spectra. The A256 was used for quantification. Arabidopsis Contains Three Isoforms of B12-independent MS—The first goal of our study was to identify and characterize all the genes that may encode MS in Arabidopsis, in particular regarding the occurrence of an Hcy-methylating enzyme in the chloroplast. A search in the Arabidopsis Information Resource data base (www.arabidopsis.org) revealed three genes coding putative"

The 31-kDa integral protein stomatin, a major protein of the erythrocyte membrane (1Hiebl Dirschmied C.M. Adolf G.R. Prohaska R. Biochim. Biophys.

It shares some topological and biochemical properties with the caveolins (4Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 5Liu P. Rudick M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41295-41298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), notably a large hydrophobic domain that may anchor the protein to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayer (6Salzer U. Ahorn H. Prohaska R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and palmitoylation sites (7Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Likewise, stomatin is organized in high order oligomers and associates with lipid rafts (7Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting a scaffolding function. In epithelial UAC cells, stomatin is found in two different pools, the plasma membrane and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2-positive, perinuclear vesicles representing late endosomes or lysosomes. In both compartments, stomatin co-localizes with two lipid raft-resident glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. Co-patching of stomatin with cross-linked placental alkaline phosphatase indicates an interaction of these proteins via the membrane microdomains.

Umlauf E. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cells, stomatin is identified in rafts of the plasma membrane and granular membranes (9Salzer U. Prohaska R.

Recent studies have shown that caveolin family members can associate with cytoplasmic lipid bodies (LBs), also known as lipid (storage) droplets, lipid globules, or lipid particles. Overexpression of caveolin-1, -2, and -3 leads to the targeting of these proteins to LBs that is enhanced by the treatment of the cells with brefeldin A (BFA) and/or oleic acid (11Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Ishiguro K. Tauchi K. Nomura R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 12Ostermeyer A.G. Paci J.M. Zeng Y. Lublin D.M. Munro S. Brown D.A. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 (cav1) fused to an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retrieval signal is highly concentrated in LBs, and a cav1-mutant is targeted to LBs and the Golgi complex. Moreover, treatment with BFA causes the accumulation of endogenous cav1 in LBs (12Ostermeyer A.G. Paci J.M. Zeng Y. Lublin D.M. Munro S. Brown D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Likewise, LB association of endogenous cav2 in fibroblasts is accelerated by oleic acid/BFA treatment. Studies with cav2 deletion mutants reveal that the central hydrophobic domain and the adjacent N- and C-terminal hydrophilic domains are necessary for LB targeting of this protein (11Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Ishiguro K. Tauchi K. Nomura R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The N-terminal deletion mutant of caveolin-3 specifically associates with LBs. Expression of this dominant-negative mutant causes intracellular accumulation of free cholesterol in late endosomes, a decrease in surface cholesterol, and a decrease in cholesterol efflux and synthesis (13Pol A. Luetterforst R. Lindsay M. Heino S. Ikonen E. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have shown that endogenous caveolin is associated with LBs in cultured cells treated with fatty acids and in regenerating liver (14Pol A. Martin S. Fernandez M.A. Ferguson C. Carozzi A. Luetterforst R. Enrich C. Parton R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). LBs are found in most eukaryotic cells and play a role in the storage and turnover of neutral lipids, notably triacylglycerol, cholesteryl ester, and retinyl ester, depending on the cell type (15Brown D.A.

They are thought to originate from the membrane of the ER with newly synthesized neutral lipids being inserted between the bilayer causing the cytoplasmic leaflet to bulge and eventually bud off into the cytoplasm. LBs are surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer that has a composition different from the ER membrane or rafts (19Tauchi Sato K. Ozeki S. Houjou T. Taguchi R. Fujimoto T. J. Biol.

Major mammalian LB proteins identified to date are members of the PAT protein family (the perilipins, adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), also termed adipophilin, and TIP47) (20Miura S.

Whereas perilipins are restricted to adipose and steroidogenic cells, ADRP is widely expressed in various cell types (22Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol.

The topological and biochemical similarity of stomatin and the caveolins prompted us to investigate the subcellular distribution of stomatin in response to intracellular LB accumulation. Here we show that stomatin associates with LBs when exogenously expressed at high levels or endogenously in the presence of oleic acid. Blocking vesicular transport with BFA leads to an increased association of endogenous stomatin with LBs, in accordance with the current hypothesis of LB formation. Cycloheximide treatment results in the dissociation of stomatin from LBs and appearance on acidic vesicles. Live microscopy reveals that stomatin-positive LBs are dynamic structures interacting with small vesicles and occasionally showing high motility. To gain insight into LB function, we performed a proteomic study of LB proteins from the human A431 cell line and report here the identification of 33 LB proteins, most notably Rab GTPases, lipid metabolic enzymes, and transport-associated proteins. Reagents—Aprotinin, brefeldin A, cycloheximide, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), leupeptin, Nile red, nocodazole, oleic acid, pepstatin a, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma. Tween 20 was from Merck, and reinforced nitrocellulose OPTI-TRAN BA-S 83 was from Schleicher & Schuell.

Vector Construction and Transfection—pCB6-DGVHA was described previously (32Luetterforst R. Stang E. Zorzi N. Carozzi A. Way M. Parton R.G. J.

To express human wild-type (WT) stomatin, the eukaryotic expression vector pEF-Puro.PL3 was used as described previously (33Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. J. Biol.

The cDNA coding for human WT stomatin was generated by PCR and was directionally cloned into the unique restriction sites SpeI/EcoRV. To express GFP-tagged stomatin and variants, cDNAs, which code for human WT or truncated stomatin extended by an alanine-linker (Gly-Ala-Ala-Ala) at the C terminus, were generated by PCR using the primers ST1Kozak.EcoRI, 5′-TACGGAATTCCGCCACCATGGCCGAGAAGCGGCACACAC-3′; ST287Ala.BamHI, 5′-TGCGGGATCCGGCGGCAGCGGCTCCGCCTAGATGGCTGTGTTTTGCC-3′; ST21Kozak.

MDCK or A431 cells were stably or transiently transfected using Metafectene™ (Biontex) or Calcium Phosphate (Promega). After selection in medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin and/or 70 μg/ml G418, individual stable clones were picked by trypsinization using cloning rings. Expression of the recombinant protein was screened by Western blot analysis using anti-Myc or anti-stomatin antibody. GFP-expressing clones were screened by fluorescence microscopy. The double transfectants (MDCKII/StomGFP/DGV(cav3)HA) were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-HA antibody. Isolation of Lipid Bodies—Cells were grown on 15-cm dishes in DMEM/fetal calf serum until 2 days before confluency. At this stage, the medium was supplemented with 0.4 mm oleic acid, 66.7 μm fatty acid-free BSA (22Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and the cells were grown for two more days. The cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and 4.5 ml of TNE buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin a, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added per dish. The cells were scraped off and disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer on ice. Lipid bodies were isolated essentially as described previously (34Yu W. Cassara J. Weller P.F. Blood. 2000; 95: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lysate was adjusted to 0.43 m sucrose in TNE. After centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min (2800 rpm, HB-4, Sorvall) to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells, the supernatant was transferred to a 13-ml ultracentrifuge tube (Ultraclear 14 × 95 mm, Beckman) and overlaid sequentially with 2.0 ml of 0.27 m sucrose/TNE, 0.135 m sucrose/TNE, and TNE, respectively. After centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 60 min (SW40, 29 000 rpm, Beckman), 18 fractions of 670 μl each were collected from above. Lipid bodies floated as a thin white film on top of the gradient and were resuspended in a volume of 200 μl. Isolated LBs were either solubilized in SDS-containing sample buffer for subsequent SDS-PAGE or resuspended in TNE for subsequent Nile red staining and fluorescence microscopy. Western Blot Analysis—Fractions collected from the sucrose gradients were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitro-cellulose by standard methods as described previously (8Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HighPrecisionProtein™ Standards (Bio-Rad) were used as molecular weight markers. After blocking, the blots were incubated with mouse anti-stomatin antibody GARP50 (diluted 1/15 in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8, 0.1% BSA), mouse anti-GM130 (diluted 1:250), mouse anti-KDEL receptor (diluted 1:250), rabbit anti-transferrin receptor (diluted 1:200), or with mouse anti-ADRP (diluted 1:200) for 1 h with the exception of the mouse anti-COX IV (1.4 μg/ml) that was incubated overnight. After a final wash, the blots were incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce). Visualization of signals was performed using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—MDCK, A431 cells, and UAC cells, transfected or untransfected, were grown in medium with or without 0.4 mm oleic acid, 66.7 μm fatty acid-free BSA overnight. BFA treatment was performed at 10 μg/ml BFA in DMEM/fetal calf serum medium for 5 h. Cycloheximide was used at 2 μg/ml in medium for up to 24 h. Immunofluorescence with anti-stomatin, anti-Myc, or anti-HA antibody was essentially performed as described previously (31Snyers L. Thines Sempoux D. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 281-285PubMed Google Scholar, 33Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17221-17226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with the exception that fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with the HA antibody overnight. For co-staining of LBs, the fixed cells were first immunostained and subsequently incubated with a diluted solution of Nile red (1/1000 (v/v) in phosphate-buffered saline) from a saturated solution in acetone and mounted (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories). Isolated LBs containing StomGFP were stained by incubation with Nile red at a final dilution of 1/200 for 10 min and were mounted immediately. LysoTracker (Molecular Probes) staining was performed by incubating cells with 15 nm of this dye in DMEM at 37 °C for 30 min and chasing with DMEM at 37 °C for 40 min prior to fixing. Pictures were taken using a confocal microscope (TCSNT, Leica) and the corresponding software. Nile red staining was detected in the TRITC channel, and the signal was quenched for 30 s before pictures in the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel were taken. Time Lapse Video Microscopy—MDCK cells stably transfected with StomGFP were grown on coverslips for 1 day in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum and subjected to live cell microscopy in the presence of DMEM. The setup consisted of a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope with a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat ×100 objective lens and a nitrogen-cooled back-illuminated camera (Roper Scientific). Fluorescence was excited at 488 nm with an Argon ion laser (Spectra Physics) using a power of 7 watts/cm2. A stack of six planes in the z axis was recorded and digitalized every 490 ms. Exposure time per plane was 10 ms, and the time between two planes was 10 ms. The videos are shown at 5-fold speed. Proteomic Analysis of Isolated Lipid Bodies—Isolated LBs were dissolved in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and silver-stained (35Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). The major bands were excised and in-gel digested as described previously (36Durauer A. Csaszar E. Mechtler K. Jungbauer A. Schmid E. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 890: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The peptide-mapping experiments were carried out with a Bruker REFLEX III (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer equipped with a standard nitrogen laser (337 nm). The spectra were recorded in reflectron mode, positive ionization, and with 25-kV acceleration voltage. The laser power was varied on a relative scale of 0-100 and was kept at the threshold value to obtain appropriate signal intensity. The calibration of the instrument was done externally with the peptide mixture supplied by Bruker (part number 206195). The mass spectrometry samples were prepared with a 75:25 (v/v) mixture of the α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (saturated solution in acetone) and nitrocellulose (10 mg/ml in acetone-isopropyl alcohol, 50:50 v/v). 1 μl of this solution was placed onto the polished steel sample slide and dried at room temperature. 0.5 μl of the in-gel digest was mixed with 0.5 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on this thin layer of matrix crystals, and the spots were vacuum-dried and washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Each mass spectrum was produced by accumulating data from 50 to 100 consecutive laser shots. Monoisotopic mass values are reported through the results. Highly Expressed Stomatin Is Targeted to Lipid Bodies—When MDCK cells are grown under normal cell culture conditions, endogenous stomatin is mainly targeted to perinuclear vesicles as demonstrated previously (8Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To induce the accumulation of LBs, MDCK cells were grown in medium supplemented with oleic acid. Subsequent immunofluorescence microscopy shows that endogenous stomatin does not associate with the Nile red-stained LBs but concentrates in perinuclear vesicles similar to the distribution in untreated cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, when stomatin is transiently overexpressed in untreated MDCK cells as a GFP fusion protein (StomGFP), half of the transfected cells show few small rings of StomGFP, the interior of which is stained with Nile red (not shown). Treatment of these transfected MDCK cells with oleic acid results in the formation of large spherical and oval-shaped LBs surrounded by StomGFP in almost every cell (Fig. 1B), whereas transiently expressed enhanced GFP shows a diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm and is excluded from LBs (not shown). In addition to the observed LB association, StomGFP is found on small cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 1B, arrows). Untagged WT stomatin transiently overexpressed in MDCK cells is also associated with few small LBs in roughly one-third of the transfected cells (not shown), whereas in oleic acid-treated MDCK cells, it associates effectively with large Nile red-positive LBs in three quarters of the transfected cells (Fig. 1C). The WT stomatin is also detected on cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 1C, arrows), consistent with our previous findings. To characterize the stomatin-positive LBs in more detail, we isolated LBs from oleic acid-treated MDCK cells stably expressing StomGFP by discontinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation and analyzed the gradient fractions by Western blotting. Fig. 1D shows that the major part of StomGFP is associated with LBs. The LB marker adipophilin is found exclusively in the LB fraction (Fig. 1D). To demonstrate that the ring-like fluorescence pattern of StomGFP in fixed MDCK cells is not the result of simple displacement by LBs, we stained isolated LBs with Nile red and subjected them to confocal microscopy. Fig. 1E clearly shows the association of StomGFP with the LB surface. Interestingly, some rings exhibit thickened areas of fluorescence (Fig. 1E, inset, arrowhead) that may be functionally relevant. A Small Fraction of Endogenous Stomatin Associates with LBs—To analyze LBs by Western blotting for the presence of endogenous stomatin, UAC cells were grown in medium supplemented with oleic acid and LBs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Aliquots of the gradient fractions were analyzed using antibodies against stomatin and various marker proteins as indicated (Fig. 2). A small amount of endogenous stomatin is found in the LB fraction along with the LB marker ADRP/adipophilin. The marker proteins for the Golgi complex, mitochondria, and the plasma membrane are not present in the LB fraction, whereas a small part of the ER marker KDEL receptor is found in this fraction. This finding can be explained by a partial physical interaction of LBs with the ER membrane as previously shown (13Pol A. Luetterforst R. Lindsay M. Heino S. Ikonen E. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Brefeldin A Treatment Leads to the Accumulation of Endogenous Stomatin in the ER and Targets the Protein to LBs—To confirm the hypothesis that accumulation of stomatin in the ER membrane causes its association with LBs, we increased the concentration of endogenous stomatin in the ER by treatment with BFA. Because of the resulting collapse of the Golgi complex into the ER (37Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar), the newly synthesized endogenous stomatin should accumulate in the ER membrane Therefore, we investigated the LB association of endogenous stomatin in untreated and BFA-treated UAC cells. In comparison to untreated cells that do not show stomatin-positive ring-like structures (Fig. 3A), BFA-treated cells exhibit stomatin labeling on the surface of small vesicular structures that are also stained with Nile red and therefore represent small LBs (Fig. 3B, arrows). When UAC cells are grown in the presence of oleic acid and BFA, the LB targeting of endogenous stomatin is dramatically enhanced (Fig. 3C). This association is stable for at least 17 h during the subsequent washout of BFA (Fig. 3D). Oligomerization, Lipid Raft Association and the N-terminal Domain of Stomatin Are Not Prerequisites for the Association with LBs—We have previously shown that stomatin forms high order oligomers that are soluble in Triton X-100 at room temperature (33Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17221-17226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that the tagged C-terminally truncated form of stomatin (amino acids 1-262), ST262Myc5, is not incorporated into these oligomers and is excluded from lipi"

Both intracellular trafficking and modulation of Kir channel activity are regulated by protein-protein interactions. We adopted a proteomics approach to identify proteins associated with Kir2 channels via the channel C-terminal PDZ binding motif. Detergent-solubilized rat brain and heart extracts were subjected to affinity chromatography using a Kir2.2 C-terminal matrix to purify channel-interacting proteins. Proteins were identified with multidimensional high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, N-terminal microsequencing, and immunoblotting with specific antibodies. We identified eight members of the MAGUK family of proteins (SAP97, PSD-95, Chapsyn-110, SAP102, CASK, Dlg2, Dlg3, and Pals2), two isoforms of Veli (Veli-1 and Veli-3), Mint1, and actin-binding LIM protein (abLIM) as Kir2.2-associated brain proteins. From heart extract purifications, SAP97, CASK, Veli-3, and Mint1 also were found to associate with Kir2 channels. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, including α1-, β1-, and β2-syntrophin, dystrophin, and dystrobrevin, interact with Kir2 channels, as demonstrated by immunoaffinity purification and affinity chromatography from skeletal and cardiac muscle and brain. Affinity pull-down experiments revealed that Kir2.1, Kir2.2, Kir2.3, and Kir4.1 all bind to scaffolding proteins but with different affinities for the dystrophin-associated protein complex and SAP97, CASK, and Veli. Immunofluorescent localization studies demonstrated that Kir2.2 co-localizes with syntrophin, dystrophin, and dystrobrevin at skeletal muscle neuromuscular junctions. These results suggest that Kir2 channels associate with protein complexes that may be important to target and traffic channels to specific subcellular locations, as well as anchor and stabilize channels in the plasma membrane.

These results suggest that Kir2 channels associate with protein complexes that may be important to target and traffic channels to specific subcellular locations, as well as anchor and stabilize channels in the plasma membrane. Ion channel expression, trafficking and activity are all regulated by interactions with intracellular proteins. These interactions involve the specific targeting of channels to distinct subcellular locations, recruitment of signaling molecules, stabilization at the plasma membrane, and direct channel alteration by post-translational modification.

These functions are likely to be influenced by intracellular interactions with regulatory proteins. The three most abundant strong inward rectifier potassium channels Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 contain a protein-protein interaction motif at their C terminus that can bind to scaffolding proteins that contain PDZ domains. This PDZ binding motif is only found within a subset of Kir channels that also includes Kir3.2c and Kir4.1. Via the channel C-terminal class I PDZ binding motif (amino acids S(E/A)I), Kir2 channels have been reported to interact with four scaffolding/trafficking proteins: PSD-95, SAP97, Chapsyn 110, and Veli-2 (also known as Lin-7b or Mals2) (4Cohen N.A.

PSD-95, SAP97, and Chapsyn 110 are members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, a group of proteins that act as molecular scaffolds to recruit signaling and trafficking molecules to ion channels and receptors (9Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 10Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). PSD-95 has been demonstrated to promote Kir2.3 channel clustering in the plasma membrane and to influence channel surface expression (5Nehring R.B. Wischmeyer E. Doring F. Veh R.W. Sheng M. Karschin A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 156-162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SAP97 also binds to Kir2 channels (6Leonoudakis D. Mailliard W.S. Wingerd K.L. Clegg D.O. Vandenberg C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 987-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been implicated in receptor trafficking and recruitment of signaling complexes with other receptors (11Colledge M. Dean R.A. Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Another PDZ-containing protein, Veli-2, can bind to Kir2.3 and was reported to decrease channel internalization from the plasma membrane (7Olsen O. Liu H. Wade J.B. Merot J. Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C183-C195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to these previously identified Kir2 channel-interacting proteins, a large number of other proteins contain class I PDZ domains. We hypothesized that novel channel interactions may exist with previously unidentified channel-binding proteins, and we sought to identify these potential channel regulators. Not only might proteins bind directly to channels and influence their function, but scaffolding proteins may serve as a link to recruit multiprotein complexes to the channels. PSD-95, SAP97, Veli-2, as well as other scaffolding proteins are composed of modular domain structures capable of assembling with additional proteins that may influence Kir2 channel activity, trafficking, membrane stability, and localization. We adopted a proteomics approach to identify proteins in the brain and heart that complex with Kir2 channels via the channel C-terminal PDZ binding motif. Our goal was to identify proteins that interact directly with the channels, as well as multiprotein complexes that are associated with the channels. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation coupled with immunoblotting techniques have been useful for discovery of individual interacting proteins, but protein identification involves considerable trial and error, and macromolecular complexes are difficult to analyze by this method. An inherent difficulty in immunoblotting is that it is unlikely to reveal truly novel interactions, because potential interacting proteins must be selected by some criteria from among previously identified proteins. In addition, limitations arise from the lack of specific antibodies and the need to individually test for association with each candidate protein. An alternative approach for identification of proteins is mass spectrometry. A recent study utilized affinity chromatography combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometry to determine peptide masses of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor-associated proteins separated by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (12Becamel C. Alonso G. Galeotti N. Demey E. Jouin P. Ullmer C. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. Marin P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2332-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Another study employed affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation together with tandem mass spectrometry to identify NMDA receptor-adhesion protein signaling complexes (13Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Recent advances in high pressure liquid chromatography directly coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS-MS) have led to technology that allows the identification of individual proteins within complex protein mixtures (14McCormack A.L.

Mass Spectrom. 2002; 219: 245-251Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In this study, we developed an affinity chromatography technique to specifically purify proteins associated with the C-terminal binding PDZ motif of Kir2.2. Proteins associated with the C terminus of Kir2.2 were identified by HPLC-MS-MS, N-terminal Edman degradation, and immunoblotting. We identified eight members of the MAGUK family of proteins (SAP97, PSD-95, Chapsyn-110, SAP102, CASK, Dlg2, Dlg3, and Pals2), two isoforms of Veli (Veli-1 and Veli-3), Mint1, and the actin-binding LIM protein (abLIM) as Kir2.2-associated proteins. Several of these proteins were investigated in detail in a parallel study in which we demonstrated that SAP97, CASK, Veli-3, and Mint1 form a multiprotein complex with Kir2 channels in brain and heart and showed that a CASK-containing complex is involved in channel trafficking (18Leonoudakis D. Conti L.R. Radeke C.M. McGuire L.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19051-19063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Here, we also show for the first time that components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), including α1-, β1-, and β2-syntrophin, dystrophin, and dystrobrevin, associate with the C terminus of Kir2 channels in muscle and brain. Immunofluorescent localization studies demonstrated that Kir2.2 colocalizes with the DAPC components syntrophin, dystrophin, and dystrobrevin at skeletal muscle neuromuscular junctions. Cerebellum, Whole Brain, and Heart Extract Preparation—Tissues were harvested from adult rats, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Tissues were then homogenized with a glass/Teflon homogenizer in 10 volumes of Buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 125 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), except heart, which was ground with a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen prior to homogenization. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the homogenate was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. To remove insoluble material, the homogenate was centrifuged twice (16,000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C, followed by 100,000 × g, 30 min). The supernatant from this spin was then precleared of nonspecific binding proteins by incubation with BSA-Affi-Gel, followed by passage over a GST-Affi-Gel column. These Triton X-100-solubilized cerebellum, brain, and heart extracts were subsequently used for affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitations. cDNA Constructs—cDNAs encoding C-terminal regions of Kir channels were generated by PCR and cloned in-frame to the 3′-end of GST in the bacterial expression vector pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences). The C-terminal segments of the fusion constructs coded for Kir2.1 (mouse Kir2.1 amino acids 372-428), Kir2.2 (rat Kir2.2 amino acids 362-427), Kir2.2Δ3 (rat Kir2.2 amino acids 362-424), Kir2.3 (human Kir2.3 amino acids 390-445), and rat Kir4.1 (amino acids 329-379). cDNAs encoding full-length Kir2.2 and Kir2.2Δ3 were subcloned into pcDNA1 as described previously (18Leonoudakis D.

Preparation of Affi-Gel-GST-Kir2.2 Affinity Matrix—BL21 Escherichia coli expressing either GST, GST-Kir2.2, or GST-Kir2.2Δ3 fusion proteins (6Leonoudakis D. Mailliard W.S. Wingerd K.L. Clegg D.O.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 987-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were pelleted and resuspended in 40 ml of HNG (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) plus 1% Triton X-100 on ice. Cells were lysed with a French press. The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Two milliliters of packed glutathione-agarose beads was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated 30 min at 4 °C while rotating. Beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was removed, followed by washing the beads three times, once with HNG plus 1% Triton X-100 and twice with HNG. Bound GST fusion proteins were eluted from beads by the addition of 20 mm glutathione (Sigma). Eluted proteins were then dialyzed against 200 volumes 1× PBS overnight at 4 °C. To prepare affinity columns, 5 mg of purified GST fusion protein was incubated with 1 ml of packed Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C according to manufacturer's instructions. To remove uncross-linked fusion protein, the Affi-Gel-10/GST fusion protein matrix was transferred to a column and washed consecutively with 20 volumes of Buffer C (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 125 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 20 volumes of Buffer C with 2.5 m urea, 20 volumes of Buffer C with 4 m urea, 10 volumes of Buffer D with 1% Triton X-100, and finally 10 volumes of Buffer D with 1 mm PMSF, 0.02% sodium azide and stored as 50/50 slurry at 4 °C. Affinity Chromatography for Silver Staining, Western Blotting, and Mass Spectrometry—50 μl of packed Affi-Gel-GST fusion protein matrix (5 mg/ml) was added to 10 ml of 1% Triton X-100 solubilized rat brain or heart protein (∼10 mg/ml) and incubated in batch overnight at 4 °C while rotating. At 4 °C, matrix was loaded onto a column and washed with 1000 column volumes of Buffer D wash (Buffer D, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 (Nonidet P-40), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF) followed by 1000 column volumes of Buffer D with 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF. Columns were moved to room temperature, and bound proteins were eluted with 400 μl of Buffer D, 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with 2 mg/ml competitive peptide (ERPYRRESEI) for 1 h, followed by elution with Buffer D containing 1% SDS. Eluted proteins were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid, washed with -20 °C acetone, and dried with centrifugation under vacuum. Dried proteins were either used directly for mass spectrometry analysis (see below) or resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were either silver-stained (Silver Stain Plus, Bio-Rad) or transblotted to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with primary antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins on membranes were detected by incubation with Supersignal West Dura enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) followed by exposure to x-ray film. Affinity Chromatography for N-terminal Microsequencing—Brain extract was subjected to the purification scheme described above, but scaled up ten times. Purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-P (Amersham Biosciences) polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. Proteins transferred to PVDF were stained with Coomassie Blue and air-dried, the desired protein bands were excised, and N-terminal protein microsequencing was performed by automated Edman degradation (Proseq Inc.). Multidimensional High Pressure Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry—The trichloroacetic acid-precipitated sample was reduced and alkylated using Tris 2-carboxyethyl phosphine and iodoacetamide according to the methods of McCormack et al.

The sample was then sequentially digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Diagnostics) and sequencing grade soluble trypsin (Promega) to produce a large collection of peptide fragments (14McCormack A.L. Schieltz D.M. Goode B. Yang S. Barnes G. Drubin D. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The resulting peptide mixture was then separated and analyzed by multidimensional protein identification technology, which features a series of HPLC columns (reverse phase/strong cation exchanger/reverse phase) followed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry as described previously (15Link A.J.

Mitchison T.J. Yates III, J.R. Intl. J. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 219: 245-251Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Tandem mass spectra were searched against the rat, mouse, and human translated genomic databases using the SEQUEST software algorithm (20Yates III, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal.

Search results were filtered and grouped using the DTASelect program, which generates a file in which peptides are matched to a genetic locus (22Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar) and identifications confirmed through manual evaluation of spectra. Eluted proteins common to both the control (Kir2.2Δ3) and experimental (Kir2.2) columns were subtracted using the Contrast algorithm, which allows the comparison of two datasets from different mass spectrometry runs (22Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Common contaminants such as the GST fusion protein, keratin, hemoglobin, HSP70, and tubulin were also subtracted as nonspecific binding proteins. GST Fusion Protein Pull-down Assay—Pull-down assays with GST fusion proteins were performed as described (6Leonoudakis D. Mailliard W.S. Wingerd K.L. Clegg D.O. Vandenberg C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 987-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 10 mg of heart extract (see above) and 10 μg of GST fusion protein per pull-down. COS-1 Cell Protein Expression and Co-immunoprecipitation—COS-1 cells were co-transfected with α1-, β1-, or β2-syntrophin with Kir2.2 or Kir2.2Δ3 utilizing FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and used for co-immunoprecipitation as described (18Leonoudakis D.

Anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) were used where appropriate. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Mice were euthanized with CO2, and sternomastoid muscles were dissected and immediately flash frozen in isopentane. Muscle was mounted with Histoprep. 16-μm frozen sections were cut with a cryostat (Leica CM 1850) and transferred to charged microscope slides (Fisher Scientific). Sections were fixed with 100% methanol 10 min at -20 °C then incubated in blocking buffer (3% BSA, 1% donkey serum, 1% goat serum in 1× PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Sections then were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Sections were washed 5 times 30 min with PBS at room temperature. Sections were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (1:50 donkey anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch); 1:200 goat anti-IgG1 Alexa Fluor 647; 1:200 α-bungarotoxin, Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate (Molecular Probes)) overnight at 4 °C, followed by washing 5 times 30 min with PBS at room temperature. Coverslips were then mounted on sections with Prolong (Molecular Probes). Images were captured using an Olympus Fluoview 500 laser scanning confocal microscope, and images were merged and displayed with Adobe Photoshop. Affi-Gel-GST-Kir2.2 Affinity Chromatography Specifically Purifies and Enriches Kir2-associated Proteins—Previously, GST fusion protein affinity chromatography was used to identify the Kir2-associated proteins SAP97 and PSD-95 (6Leonoudakis D. Mailliard W.S. Wingerd K.L. Clegg D.O. Vandenberg C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 987-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To establish a large scale affinity chromatography approach for identification of Kir2-associated proteins, we covalently crosslinked Affi-Gel-10 matrix to a GST-Kir2.2 C-terminal fusion protein (Kir2.2), and a control GST-Kir2.2 fusion protein with the three C-terminal amino acids deleted (Kir2.2Δ3) (Fig. 1A). Comparing proteins isolated by these columns should allow one to identify proteins that are specifically associated with the Kir2.2 C-terminal PDZ binding motif (ESEI; Fig. 1A). We incubated these matrices with detergent-solubilized rat cerebellum extracts, washed the columns extensively, and eluted bound proteins by competition with an excess of the competitive peptide, which corresponds to final ten C-terminal amino acids of Kir2.2. Eluted Kir2.2-associated proteins were then analyzed and identified by a number of different methods: 1) subjecting the eluted protein mixture directly to multidimensional high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS-MS) followed by protein data base searching with identified peptide masses, 2) SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membrane and identification of candidate proteins by microsequencing using N-terminal Edman degradation, and 3) SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose and probing the membrane with antibodies to candidate proteins (Fig. 1B). We employed control experiments to verify that our Kir2.2 columns could efficiently and specifically purify proteins from detergent-solubilized rat cerebellum, a brain region in which Kir2.2 expression is high (28Takahashi N.

Morishige K. Takahashi N. Kurachi Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Extracts were incubated with Affi-Gel-linked GST, Kir2.2, or Kir2.2Δ3 and eluted with the competitive peptide. Eluted proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained. Proteins that were specifically bound and eluted from the Kir2.2 column with the competitive peptide could easily be detected (Fig. 1C, silver stain, lane 4, arrowheads). These specific Kir2.2-binding proteins were not detected in eluates from the control GST or Kir2.2Δ3 columns (Fig. 1C, silver stain, lanes 2 and 3). As a separate control for the specificity of the eluting peptide, a scrambled peptide encoding the same amino acids as the competitive peptide, but in a random order, was used to elute protein isolated by the Kir2.2 column. None of the specific proteins eluted by the competitive peptide were eluted by the scrambled peptide (Fig. 1C, silver stain, lane 5). This shows that the competitive peptide specifically elutes proteins associated with the C terminus of Kir2.2. To demonstrate that the Affi-Gel-Kir2.2 matrix could efficiently enrich known Kir2.2-interacting proteins (4Cohen N.A. Brenman J.E. Snyder S.H. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 759-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 6Leonoudakis D. Mailliard W.S. Wingerd K.L. Clegg D.O. Vandenberg C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 987-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), eluted fractions from columns were subjected to Western blotting with anti-SAP97 antibodies. SAP97 was significantly and specifically enriched in competitive peptide eluates as was PSD-95, which is also recognized by the antibody (Fig. 1C, peptide elution, lane 4). No SAP97 or PSD-95 could be detected in peptide eluates from the GST or Kir2.2Δ3 columns (Fig. 1C, peptide"
https://openalex.org/W2015594876,"Mitochondria modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by taking up, buffering, and releasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> at key locations near Ca<sup>2+</sup> release or influx channels. The role of such local interactions between channels and organelles is difficult to establish in living cells because mitochondria form an interconnected network constantly remodeled by coordinated fusion and fission reactions. To study the effect of a controlled disruption of the mitochondrial network on Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, we took advantage of hFis1, a protein that promotes mitochondrial fission by recruiting the dynamin-related protein, Drp1. hFis1 expression in HeLa cells induced a rapid and complete fragmentation of mitochondria, which redistributed away from the plasma membrane and clustered around the nucleus. Despite the dramatic morphological alteration, hFis1-fragmented mitochondria maintained a normal transmembrane potential and pH and took up normally the Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from intracellular stores upon agonist stimulation, as measured with a targeted ratiometric pericam probe. In contrast, hFis1-fragmented mitochondria took up more slowly the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering across plasma membrane channels, because the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions reaching mitochondria propagated faster and in a more coordinated manner in interconnected than in fragmented mitochondria. In parallel cytosolic fura-2 measurements, the capacitative Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (CCE) elicited by store depletion was only marginally reduced by hFis1 expression. Regardless of mitochondria shape and location, disruption of mitochondrial potential with uncouplers or oligomycin/rotenone reduced CCE by ∼35%. These observations indicate that close contact to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx channels is not required for CCE modulation and that the formation of a mitochondrial network facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation within interconnected mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2014753160,"The present study addressed the role of <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation of the human dopamine transporter (DAT) in its function with the help of mutants, in which canonical <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites have been removed (N181Q, N181Q,N188Q, and N181Q,N188Q,N205Q), expressed in human embryonic kidney-293 cells. Removal of canonical sites produced lower molecular weight species as did enzymatic deglycosylation or blockade of glycosylation, and all three canonical sites were found to carry sugars. Prevention of <i>N</i>-glycosylation reduced both surface and intracellular DAT. Although partially or non-glycosylated DAT was somewhat less represented at the surface, no evidence was found for preferential exclusion of such material from the plasma membrane, indicating that glycosylation is not essential for DAT expression. Non-glycosylated DAT was less stable at the surface as revealed by apparently enhanced endocytosis, consonant with weaker DAT immunofluorescence at the cell surface and stronger presence in cytosol in confocal analysis of the double and triple mutant. Non-glycosylated DAT did not transport dopamine as efficiently as wild-type DAT as judged from the sharp reduction in uptake <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>, and prevention of <i>N</i>-glycosylation enhanced the potency of cocaine-like drugs in inhibiting dopamine uptake into intact cells without changing their affinity for DAT when measured in membrane preparations prepared from these cells. Thus, non-glycosylated DAT at the cell surface displays appreciably reduced catalytic activity and altered inhibitor sensitivity compared with wild type."
https://openalex.org/W2168360174,"The polyamine pathway of protozoan parasites has been successfully targeted in anti-parasitic therapies and is significantly different from that of the mammalian host. To gain knowledge into the metabolic routes by which parasites synthesize polyamines and their precursors, the arginase gene was cloned from Leishmania mexicana, and Δarg null mutants were created by double targeted gene replacement and characterized. The ARG sequence exhibited significant homology to ARG proteins from other organisms and predicted a peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS-1) that steers proteins to the glycosome, an organelle unique to Leishmania and related parasites. ARG was subsequently demonstrated to be present in the glycosome, whereas the polyamine biosynthetic enzymes, in contrast, were shown to be cytosolic. The Δarg knockouts expressed no ARG activity, lacked an intracellular ornithine pool, and were auxotrophic for ornithine or polyamines. The ability of the Δarg null mutants to proliferate could be restored by pharmacological supplementation, either with low putrescine or high ornithine or spermidine concentrations, or by complementation with an arginase episome. Transfection of an arg construct lacking the PTS-1 directed the synthesis of an arg that mislocalized to the cytosol and notably also complemented the genetic lesion and restored polyamine prototrophy to the Δarg parasites. This molecular, biochemical, and genetic dissection of ARG function in L. mexicana promastigotes establishes: (i) that the enzyme is essential for parasite viability; (ii) that Leishmania, unlike mammalian cells, expresses only one ARG activity; (iii) that the sole vital function of ARG is to provide polyamine precursors for the parasite; and (iv) that ARG is present in the glycosome, but this subcellular milieu is not essential for its role in polyamine biosynthesis.

Leishmania is a genus of protozoan parasite that is the causative agent of leishmaniasis, a spectrum of devastating and potentially deadly diseases that affects ∼12 million people worldwide. The parasite exhibits a digenetic life cycle in which the extracellular promastigote form resides in the phlebotomine sandfly vector, whereas the intracellular amastigote inhabits the phagolysosomes of macrophages from the infected mammalian host. Because there are no vaccines available to prevent leishmaniasis, chemotherapy offers the only avenue to combat the disease. Unfortunately, the current arsenal of drugs used to treat leishmaniasis is far from ideal, mainly because of toxicity and therapeutic unresponsiveness. Thus, the identification, characterization, and validation of novel therapeutic targets are urgently needed. One biochemical pathway that has been successfully exploited for the treatment of parasitic disease is that for polyamine biosynthesis. Polyamines are ubiquitous organic cations found in virtually every eukaryotic cell and play critical roles in key cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and macromolecular biosynthesis (1Tabor C.W.

Parasitol. 1990; 39: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and an arginase gene sequence from Leishmania amazonensis has been reported, although neither the gene nor protein was functionally characterized (27da Silva E.R. Castilho T.M. Pioker F.C. Tomich de Paula Silva C.H. Floeter-Winter L.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). ARG has also been touted as a potential antileishmanial drug target, because n-hydroxyarginine, an inhibitor of ARG that is produced by macrophages as an intermediate during the formation of nitric oxide, can reduce polyamine levels in Leishmania amastigotes and lowers parasite loads (28Iniesta V. Gomez-Nieto L.C. Corraliza I. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To initiate an investigation into the pathways by which polyamine precursors are synthesized and to begin a validation of ARG as a potential therapeutic target, we have cloned arginase from L. mexicana and generated Δarg knockouts by double targeted gene replacement. The characterization of these gene deletion mutants reveals that the arginase is essential for promastigote viability and that the lethality of the null mutation could be conditionally bypassed by either low concentrations of putrescine, high concentrations of ornithine or spermidine, or episomal complementation. Furthermore, we have established that the L. mexicana ARG is localized to the glycosome, a unique organelle found exclusively in Leishmania and close relatives (29Hart D.T. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30Opperdoes F.R. Borst P. FEBS Lett. 1977; 80: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), and that this localization is mediated by the peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS-1). However, genetic complementation demonstrated that this glycosomal venue is not essential for ARG function, at least in promastigotes. Materials, Chemicals, and Reagents—[14C]Glutamate (219 mCi/mmol), [14C]putrescine (110 mCi/mmol), and [14C]ornithine (53 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals Inc. (Brea, CA), whereas l-[guanidino-14C]arginine (55 mCi/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). All restriction enzymes were bought from either Invitrogen Corp. or New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Synthetic oligonucleotides were acquired from Invitrogen. Advantage HF 2 DNA polymerase was purchased from BD Bioscience, Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was acquired from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and TaqDNA polymerase was from Promega Corp. The transfection vectors pX63-HYG (15Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), pX63-PHLEO (31Freedman D.J.

Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) were constructed by and obtained from Dr. Stephen M. Beverley (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Hygromycin was procured from Roche Applied Science, phleomycin from Research Products International (Mt. Prospect, IL), and Geneticin (G418) from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Ornithine, putrescine, spermidine, glutamate, and proline were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest quality commercially available. Cell Culture—Wild type L. mexicana parasites (MNYC/BZ/62/M379) were generously provided by Dr. Scott M. Landfear (Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR). Parasites were cultivated in DME-L, a completely defined Dulbecco's modified Eagle-based medium that was specifically developed for growing Leishmania promastigotes (33Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Transfected parasites were maintained in a modified DME-L medium, DME-L-CS, in which the bovine serum albumin component of DME-L was replaced with 10% chicken serum to avert polyamine oxidase-mediated polyamine toxicity (8Kaur K. Emmett K. McCann P.P. Sjoerdsma A. Ullman B. J. Protozool. 1986; 33: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). arginase/arg heterozygotes were maintained continually in 50 μg/ml hygromycin, whereas Δarg homozygotes were grown in DME-L-CS supplemented with 50 μg/ml phleomycin, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, and either 200 μm ornithine and/or 200-500 μm putrescine. Parasite growth experiments were initiated at 1.0 × 105 parasites/ml, and parasites were enumerated either every 24 or 48 h by hemacytometer or using the vital dye alamarBlue™ (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA) technology (34Mikus J. Steverding D. Parasitol. Int. 2000; 48: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Reduction of alamarBlue™ was measured at 570 and 600 nm on a Multiskan Ascent plate reader (Thermo Labsystems, Vantaa, Finland). The percent reduction of dye was calculated according to a formula published in the manufacturer's brochure. The greatest reduction was expressed as maximal proliferation, and growth was then plotted as a function of nutrient concentration. Cloning of L. mexicana ARG—The arginase sequence from L. amazonensis (GenBank™ accession number AF038409) was used to design primers to amplify the ARG from L. mexicana genomic DNA using the PCR. Genomic DNA was isolated by standard protocols. The sense primer, 5′-GGATCCATGGAGCACGTGCAGTACAAGTTC-3′, encompassed the initiation methionine codon (boldface type) and was preceded by a BamHI restriction site (underlined), whereas the antisense primer, 5′-TCTAGACTACAGCTTGGAGCTCGTATGCGGAGT-3′, encoded the termination codon (boldface type) to which a BglII site (underlined) was attached at the 5′-end. The arginase open reading frame (ORF) was amplified from 20 ng of L. mexicana DNA using a high fidelity polymerase (Advantage HF 2 DNA polymerase, BD Bioscience, Palo Alto, CA) and standard PCR conditions for amplifying sequences from genomic DNA (95 °C for 5 min followed by 32 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 2 min). The ∼1.0-kb-amplified DNA fragment was subcloned using the pCR® 2.1-TOPO® vector of the TOPO TA Cloning™ kit (Invitrogen), and limited nucleotide sequencing confirmed the identity of the putative arginase fragment. The resulting plasmid was designated TOPO TA-arginase. The subcloned arginase fragment was then used to screen an L. mexicana cosmid library constructed by Dr. Scott M. Landfear (Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR) using high stringency conditions. Positive cosmids were subjected to two rounds of purification, and the cosmid DNA isolated by standard methods. The arginase locus within a positive cosmid was mapped by Southern blotting, and a ∼7-kb BamHI fragment encompassing the arginase ORF was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting plasmid was designated pBluescript-arginase and submitted for nucleotide sequencing. The entire nucleotide sequences of the arginase ORF (both directions), and ∼1 kb of each of the flanks was obtained. Construction of pXG-GFP+2′-ARG—To localize ARG, the gene was inserted into pXG-GFP+2′, a leishmanial expression vector that confers resistance to G418 and synthesizes foreign protein as an NH2-terminal fusion with green fluorescent protein (GFP). The arginase ORF was excised from the TOPO TA-arginase vector with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI cut pXG-GFP+2′ vector. Sequence analysis verified the correct orientation and reading frame of the arginase coding region. The resulting expression plasmid was designated pXG-GFP+2′- arginase. This plasmid was then transfected into wild type L. mexicana using standard electroporation conditions (17LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fluorescence Microscopy—Lab-Tek® II Chambered Coverglass slides (Fisher Scientific) were coated with a 1:10 dilution of poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) for 15 min. The chambers were rinsed with double-deionized water to remove excess poly-l-lysine and allowed to dry at room temperature. 1 × 107 Leishmania promastigotes were resuspended in 1.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pipetted into the chamber, and allowed to attach for 15 min. Chambers were rinsed once and then overlaid with 500 μl of PBS. Images were taken on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope and deconvolution performed using the constrained iterative method by Axiovision 3.1 software (Carl Zeiss Optical, Chesterfield, VA). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—L. donovani promastigotes at a density of ∼5 × 106/ml were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min, rinsed with PBS, and affixed to 4-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc. International, Rochester, NY) that had been pretreated with poly-l-lysine. Cells were fixed in a PBS solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde or PBS containing only 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Chamber slides were rinsed once with PBS to remove fixative and incubated in a blocking solution consisting of PBS supplemented with 2% goat serum, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.1% Triton X-100, which also permeabilized the parasites, for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies against the L. donovani ODC, SPDSYN, and ADOMETDC proteins (18Jiang Y. Roberts S.C. Jardim A. Carter N.S. Shih S. Ariyanayagam M. Fairlamb A.H. Ullman B. J. Biol.

After incubation of fixed parasites with primary antibody for 1 h, all chamber slides were rinsed six times for 5 min with a PBS wash solution containing 0.1% Tween 20. Fixed cells were then incubated with secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Texas Red dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) that had been diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. The incubation and all subsequent steps were performed in the dark. Secondary antibody was removed by soaking chamber slides six times for 5 min in wash buffer. Chamber slides were washed in PBS and mounted with either Vectashield® mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) or a solution of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 8% n-propylgalate (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.), and 90% glycerol. Images shown in Fig. 2 (E and F) were obtained by Aurelie Snyder of the Oregon Health & Science University-Molecular Microbiology and Immunology Research Core Facility (www.ohsu.edu/core) with the Applied Precision Deltavision® image restoration system. Deconvolution was performed using the iterative constrained algorithm of Agard et al. (36Agard D.A. Hiraoka Y. Shaw P. Sedat J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 353-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), and additional image processing was performed on an Silicon Graphics Octane workstation. Images for Fig. 2 (A-D and G) were obtained by using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope and deconvolution accomplished using Axiovision 3.1 software (Carl Zeiss Optical, Chesterfield, VA). Molecular Constructs for the Replacement of the Arginase Alleles—The 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the L. mexicana arginase ORF were identified from sequence analysis of the arginase locus and cloned into the appropriate sites within the pX63-HYG and pX63-PHLEO vectors. The 5′-flanking region was amplified by PCR with TaqDNA polymerase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), pBluescript-arginase as a template, the sense primer, 5′-CCGCTGAAGCTTGGAGATACGCCCCCGAGG-3′ (HindIII site underlined), and the antisense primer, 5′-GTTCAACATGTCGACCTTGCCAT-3′ (SalI site underlined). The resulting ∼720-bp PCR product was first subcloned into the pCR® 2.1-TOPO® vector and then excised with HindIII and SalI and inserted into pX63-HYG and pX63-PHLEO that had been digested with HindIII and SalI. The resulting plasmids were designated pX63-HYG-5′F and pX63-PHLEO- 5′F. To generate the 3′ arginase flank for subcloning into pX63-HYG- 5′F, a sense primer, 5′-GTAAATCCCGGGAAGCTATAGACGCGTGTGTG-3′, and an antisense primer, 5′-GGCATTCCCGGGGCGTTTACACTCCCTGG-3′ (SmaI sites underlined), were synthesized, and pBlue-script-arginase was used as the template for PCR amplification. The ∼500-bp PCR product was subcloned into the pCR® 2.1-TOPO® vector, excised with SmaI, gel-purified, and ligated into SmaI-cut pX63-HYG-5′F vector to generate the allelic replacement vector pX63-HYG-Δarg. Because of the presence of a SmaI sites within the PHLEO coding region of pX63-PHLEO, a different cloning strategy was employed to insert the 3′-flanking region of arginase into pX63-PHLEO-5′F. A ∼1.0-kb sequence from the 3′-flanking region of arginase was amplified by PCR using the sense primer, 5′-TGCGCACACACAGATCTATATTTAT-3′, and the antisense primer, 5′-GCAACTCCGAAACCAGATCTCCTCC-3′ (BglII sites underlined). The 1.0-kb PCR fragment was subcloned into the pCR® 2.1-TOPO® vector, excised with BglII, and the fragment was cloned into pX63-PHLEO-5′F that had been digested with BamHI and BglII to generate pX63-PHLEO-Δarg. The correct orientations of the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions within the gene-targeting plasmids were confirmed by restriction mapping and limited nucleotide sequencing of the insert junctions. Generation of Δarg Null Mutants—The Δarg knockouts were generated by double-targeted gene replacement starting with wild type MNYC/BZ/62/M379 L. mexicana. pX63-HYG-Δarg and pX63-PHLEO-Δarg were digested with HindIII and BglII to liberate linear fragments, designated HYG-Δarg and PHLEO-Δarg, respectively, containing the drug resistance marker and the arginase flanking regions. HYG-Δarg and PHLEO-Δarg were isolated from agarose gels and then transfected into parasites using standard electroporation conditions for transfection of Leishmania promastigotes (17LeBowitz J.H.

First, HYG-Δarg was transfected into wild type L. mexicana to create the arginase/arg heterozygote, and colonies were isolated by selection on plates of semi-solid DME-L-CS medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin. The genotype of the arginase/arg heterozygote was then confirmed by Southern blot analysis using arginase flanking regions as probes. A heterozygous clone was then subjected to a second round of transfection with PHLEO-Δarg and Δarg null lines selected in liquid DME-L-CS media containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin, 50 μg/ml phleomycin, and 200 μm ornithine to circumvent potential ornithine auxotrophy. The Δarg genotype was verified by Southern blotting, and clones were isolated on semi-solid DME-L-CS plates containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin, 50 μg/ml phleomycin, and 200 μm ornithine. A total of 12 clones were picked and screened by Southern blotting using the arginase ORF as a probe. The gene replacements of two of the Δarg clones were evaluated in more detail by probing Southern blots with the arginase flanks. ARG Assays—The ARG activities in wild type, knockout, and transfected parasites were determined using lysates prepared from 1 × 108 exponentially growing parasites that had been resuspended in 150 μl of 50 mm glycine/10 mm MnCl2/1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 9.5. A protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was added, and the cells were sonicated three times for 10 s each. Protein concentrations in the resultant cell lysates were determined according to the Bradford method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217390) Google Scholar). ARG assays were initiated by the addition of 20 μl of parasite extract (2.5 mg of protein/ml) to an 80-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm glycine/10 mm MnCl2/1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 9.5, and 10 mm l-[guanidino-14C]arginine (31.3 μCi/mmol). At various intervals, the enzyme reaction was terminated by the addition of 10-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture to 5 μl of glacial acetic acid. The [14C]urea product was separated from unreacted l-[guanidino-14C]arginine by paper chromatography using Whatman #1 chromatography paper as the matrix and n-butanol:acetic acid:water (8:1:2) as the mobile phase. RF values for urea and arginine were 0.31 and 0.00, respectively. The [14C]urea formed during the assay was detected by autoradiography and quantitated using a Beckman model LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. Putrescine, Spermidine, S-Adenosylmethionine, Decarboxy-S-adenosylmethionine (dAdoMet), Ornithine, and Arginine Pool Analyses—Polyamine, AdoMet, and dAdoMet pools were measured as previously reported (19Roberts S.C.

The role of this endoproteolytic cleavage of PrP in prion pathogenesis and the identity of the cellular protease responsible for production of the C2 cleavage product has not been explored. To address these issues we have taken a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches using persistently infected scrapie mouse brain (SMB) cells. We confirm that production of C2 is the predominant cleavage event of PrPSc in the brains of scrapie-infected mice and that SMB cells faithfully recapitulate the diverse intracellular proteolytic processing events of PrPSc and PrPC observed in vivo. While increases in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) levels in prion-infected cell cultures stimulate the production of the PrPSc cleavage product, pharmacological inhibitors of calpains and overexpression of the endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, prevent the production of C2. In contrast, inhibitors of lysosomal proteases, caspases, and the proteasome have no effect on C2 production in SMB cells. Calpain inhibition also prevents the accumulation of PrPSc in SMB and persistently infected ScN2A cells, whereas bioassay of inhibitor-treated cell cultures demonstrates that calpain inhibition results in reduced prion titers compared with control-treated cultures assessed in parallel. Our observations suggest that calpain-mediated endoproteolytic cleavage of PrPSc may be an important event in prion propagation.

While the detailed mechanism of prion propagation remains to be determined, considerable evidence argues that prions are devoid of nucleic acid and are composed largely, if not entirely, of the scrapie isoform of the prion protein (PrP), referred to as PrPSc. During the disease process, PrPSc acts as a template for conversion by imposing its conformation on the normally benign host-encoded version of the prion protein referred to as PrPC (reviewed in Ref. 2Weissmann C.

The conversion of PrPC into PrPSc involves a profound conformational change: PrPC has a high α-helical content and is virtually devoid of β-sheet while PrPSc has high β-sheet content (3Caughey B.W.

A hallmark of PrPSc is its insolubility in non-denaturing detergents and its relative resistance to protease digestion in vitro. Proteinase K (PK) treatment of PrPSc results in the persistence of a core molecule, referred to as PrP-(27–30), consisting predominantly of amino acid residues 89–230 (mouse PrP residue numbering) (6Oesch B.

Cell. 1985; 40: 735-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). In contrast to PrPSc, PrPC is soluble in detergents and sensitive to proteolytic digestion by PK.In addition to these biochemical differences, PrPC and PrPSc are subject to diverse intracellular proteolytic processing events (7Pan K.-M.

Previous studies demonstrated that human PrPC undergoes proteolytic cleavage at amino acids 110/111 within a segment of conserved hydrophobic amino acids to produce an ∼17-kDa C-terminal fragment referred to as C1, while a PK-resistant fragment of PrP is produced in infected brains, apparently as a result of cleavage at the same location that PK cleaves PrPSc in vitro (following amino acid residue 88 in mouse PrP). The latter cleavage produces a C-terminal fragment, referred to as C2, with the same apparent molecular mass as unglycosylated PrP-(27–30) (1Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P.

In these studies we have employed a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches to address these issues. Our studies indicate that endoproteolytic cleavage of PrPSc is facilitated by calpains.The calpain family of proteolytic enzymes is comprised of ubiquitous and tissue-specific isoforms of Ca2+-activated cysteine proteases that modify the properties of substrate proteins by cleavage at a limited number of specific sites (11Huang Y. Wang K.K. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) generating large, often catalytically active fragments. The regulatory function of calpains is in contrast to the digestive functions of, for instance, the lysosomal proteases or the proteasome. Proteolysis by calpains features in a wide range of cellular functions including, cellular differentiation, integrin-mediated cell migration, cytoskeletal remodeling, and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 12Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Calpains have also been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease (11Huang Y. Wang K.K. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 13Kim Y.J. Yi Y. Sapp E. Wang Y. Cuiffo B. Kegel K.B. Qin Z.H. Aronin N. DiFiglia M. Proc. Natl.

Trojanowski J.Q. Lynch D.R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Calpain activity is tightly regulated in vivo by Ca2+ and by the specific intracellular protein inhibitor calpastatin. The two ubiquitously expressed calpains are m-calpain and μ-calpain, which are heterodimers made up of a catalytic (∼80 kDa) and a common regulatory (∼30 kDa) subunit that require millimolar and micromolar Ca2+ concentrations, respectively, for activation. Transgenic mice in which the gene for the calpain regulatory subunit was ablated lacked detectable m- and μ-calpain activity and die at midgestation (15Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).Previous studies have identified several distinct classes of prion inhibitors including substituted tricyclic derivatives, tetrapyrrole compounds, cysteine protease inhibitors, branched polyamines, and specific anti-PrP antibodies (reviewed in Ref. 16Supattapone S. Nishina K. Rees J.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). While the mode of action of blocking antibodies appears to involve prevention of PrPSc formation by binding to PrPC and branched polyamines bind to and denature PrPSc in acidic compartments, the mechanism of inhibition by other inhibitors of PrPSc formation is unknown. Our studies suggest that calpain-dependent endoproteolytic cleavage of PrPSc may be an important step in PrPSc formation and prion propagation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Antibodies—All immunoblots probed with Fab D-18 were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-Hu secondary antibody and ECL or ECL-Plus detection (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray film. Anti-calpastatin and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA. All protease inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA. Ionomycin and A23187 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.Cell Culture and Pharmacologic Treatments—Scrapie-infected mouse brain (SMB) cells (17Clarke M.C. Haig D.A.

Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4377-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. SMB and SMB-PS cells were routinely subcultured (1:6) every 4 days, and ScN2A cells were split 1:10 using 0.05% (w/v) trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen). For inhibitor studies 0.75 × 106 SMB cells were seeded on 6-cm dishes, and 1.6 × 106 SMB cells were seeded on 10-cm dishes. Stock solutions of protease inhibitors in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) were added to cell culture media at various final concentrations. During inhibitor treatments, medium containing fresh inhibitor was replaced daily, and control-treated cells were cultured in medium containing an equal volume of Me2SO without inhibitor. When cells achieved confluence, usually after 4 days, cells were lysed, and total protein content was determined. For Ca2+ ionophore treatments, the culture medium of subconfluent monolayers of SMB cells was replaced for 1 h with Optimem (Invitrogen) containing 2 mm CaCl2 and various concentrations of ionomycin or A23187, after which detergent extracts were prepared. In transfection experiments SMB cells were transfected at 90% confluence with 10 μg of a modified version of the pRK5 expression plasmid containing a selectable neomycin resistance marker and the full-length human calpastatin cDNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Control cultures were transfected with empty vector expressing only the neomycin resistance gene. Transfected cultures were bulk-selected in the presence of 0.35 mg/ml G418.Analysis of PrP—Brain homogenates (10% (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) from RML scrapie-infected CD-1 Swiss mice and uninoculated CD-1 Swiss mice were prepared by repeated extrusion through an 18-gauge syringe needle followed by a 21-gauge needle in PBS lacking calcium and magnesium ions. Nuclei and debris were removed from brain homogenates by brief centrifugation at 1,000 × g. Sarkosyl was added at a final concentration of 2%. For cell cultures, after washing in PBS, cells were treated with cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Igepal CA-630), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. Total protein content of cell culture or brain extracts was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.) using a BioTek plate reader. For deglycosylation, 50-μg protein aliquots were mixed with recombinant peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) for 1 h at 37 °C, as specified by the supplier (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). In all experiments involving PK digestion, the final concentration of PK was 20 μg/ml, and the ratio of total protein to PK was 50:1. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and digestion was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 2 mm. For PrP-(27–30) analysis in brain extracts, homogenates containing 50 μg of total protein were treated with PK. For PrP-(27–30) analysis in cultured cells, detergent extracts containing 1 mg of total protein in the case of SMB cells or 2 mg of total protein in the case of ScN2A cells were PK-treated, and insoluble PrP-(27–30) was purified by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TLX100 ultracentrifuge. Samples were boiled in an equal volume of 2× nonreducing SDS loading buffer for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20.Cell Viability—0.2 × 106 SMB cells were seeded in 6-well plates in medium containing 50 μm MDL28170, calpeptin, or calpain inhibitor IV. Medium containing fresh inhibitor was changed daily, and control-treated cells were cultured in medium containing an equal volume of Me2SO without inhibitor. When cells achieved confluence they were trypsinized and reseeded onto 6-well plates, and the following day inhibitor-containing medium was replaced with normal medium containing 1 μg/ml calcein-AM and propidium iodide dyes for 30 min at 37 °C. Medium was removed, and cells were washed briefly with PBS. Cells were observed under ×10 magnification using an Olympus IX 50 inverted fluorescent microscope. Counts of live cells fluorescing green and dead cells fluorescing orange were determined in a total of 4 fields for each well with a minimum of 200 cells counted in each field. Analysis was performed in triplicate for each inhibitor, and the average and standard deviations were calculated for each condition.Bioassay—The RML mouse scrapie prion isolate from Swiss mice was passaged in Swiss CD-1 mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). For inoculation of Swiss CD-1 mice, 10% (w/v) homogenates of RML-infected mouse brain were prepared by repeated extrusion through an 18-gauge syringe needle followed by a 21-gauge needle in PBS lacking calcium and magnesium ions. Samples were diluted 10-fold in PBS prior to inoculation. Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of halothane and O2, and inoculated intracerebrally with 30-μl samples prepared from brain using a 27-gauge needle inserted into the right parietal lobe. All mice were thereafter examined three times weekly for clinical signs of prion disease. As soon as any animal was identified as having progressive neurological symptoms consistent with prion infection, the animal was humanely killed by asphyxiation with CO2. For bioassay of prion infectivity in MDL28170-treated and non-treated SMB cells, groups of CD-1 Swiss mice (n = 12) were inoculated intracerebrally with MDL28170-treated and control-treated SMB cells passaged in parallel. Cells were suspended in 1 ml of PBS, and a 30-μl cell suspension (∼1.8 × 104 cells) was inoculated in each case into the right parietal lobe using a 27-gauge needle. The end point of the bioassay was the time to appearance of definitive clinical symptoms, referred to as the scrapie incubation time.Quantification of PrP and Statistical Analyses—Densitometric analysis of C1, C2, and PrP-(27–30) levels in SMB cells was performed with a Kodak Imaging System using Image for Windows version 3b (Scion). All statistical analyses including the Student's t tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego CA.RESULTSPrPC and PrPSc Are Cleaved by Endogenous Proteases in Brain and Cultured Cells to Produce Cleavage Products with Distinct Biochemical Properties—While PrPSc is usually defined by its relative resistance to protease digestion in vitro, we avoided the use of PK in our analyses to allow the detection of intact and endogenously cleaved forms of PrPC and PrPSc. Since the C1 and C2 cleavage products contain the sites for asparagine (Asn)-linked glycosylation of PrP (Fig. 1) and, like full-length PrP, consist of multiple glycoforms that are normally obscured by other glycosylated and unglycosylated PrP species, we removed Asn-linked glycans by treatment of mouse brain homogenates and cultured cell extracts with PNGase F to simplify our analysis of PrPC and PrPSc processing. For immunologic detection of mouse PrP we used recombinant PrP-specific Fab D-18, which detects an epitope between amino acid residues 133 and 157 (20Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Kaneko K. Vergara J. Leclerc E. Schmitt-Ulms G. Mehlhorn I.R. Legname G. Wormald M.R. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Burton D.R. Prusiner S.B. Nature. 2001; 412: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and therefore recognizes full-length PrPC, PrPSc, C2, and C1 (Fig. 1).In addition to full-length PrP (F) with an apparent molecular mass of ∼28 kDa, C-terminal PrP fragments of ∼21 and ∼17 kDa were detected in the brains of clinically affected mice infected with mouse-adapted RML scrapie prions (Fig. 2a, lane 7) whereas full-length PrP and the 17-kDa fragment predominated in uninfected mouse brains (Fig. 2a, lane 3). Like PrPSc, the 21-kDa fragment was partially resistant to PK and had the same apparent molecular mass as the unglycosylated form of as PrP-(27–30) (Fig. 2a, lanes 6 and 8). The 21-kDa fragment therefore corresponds mainly to the PrPSc-specific cleavage product, designated C2, detected in post-mortem brain extracts from patients with CJD (1Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P.

C2 was also detected in glycosidase-treated brain extracts from Syrian hamsters infected with the Sc237 strain of prions. 2K. Nishina and S. Supattapone, personal communication. The ∼17-kDa PK-sensitive C-terminal PrP fragment, present in uninfected and RML-infected mouse brain extracts (Fig. 2a), corresponds to the PrPC-specific cleavage product C1 fragment previously identified in human brain extracts (1Chen S.G.

While C2 was predominantly produced under conditions of prion infection, a cleavage product of similar molecular mass as C2, which did not survive treatment with PK, was produced at much lower levels in uninfected mouse brains (Fig. 2a, lane 3). A similar endoproteolytically cleaved fragment of human PrP, referred to as soluble PrP-(27–30), was detected in previous studies following partial deglycosylation of human platelet material (22Perini F.

Nature. 1970; 225: 100-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which are persistently infected with scrapie mouse prions, and their uninfected counterparts SMB-PS cells, which were cleared of infectivity by chronic pentosan sulfate treatment (18Birkett C.R. Hennion R.M. Bembridge D.A. Clarke M.C. Chree A. Bruce M.E. Bostock C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3351-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), revealed that proteolytic processing of PrPC and PrPSc mirrored the processing of PrPC and PrPSc observed in vivo, with C2 produced under conditions of prion infection (Fig. 2b). As expected from previous studies of chronically infected cells, levels of PrP-(27–30) were roughly 10-fold lower in chronically infected cultured cells compared with brain extracts from clinically sick mice.We took two approaches to ensure that the PrP proteolysis we observed occurred as a result of specific cellular proteases and not as a result of nonspecific proteases acting during extraction. First, treatment of 1.25 μg of recombinant MoPrP with glycosidase in the presence or absence of 50 μg of total protein from Prnp0/0 brain extract did not result in the appearance of cleavage products similar to C1 and C2. Control samples consisted of untreated recombinant mouse PrP and PN-GaseF-treated SMB cell lysate (Fig. 2c). Second, we observed the same pattern of full-length, C2, and C1 when SMB detergent extracts were prepared in the presence of 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), 0.2 mm MDL28170 or 0.2 mm calpain inhibitor IV compared with control SMB detergent extracts prepared in the absence of inhibitors (Fig. 2d).Differential Regulation of C1 and C2 Cleavage in the Infected and Uninfected States—Comparison of C1 and C2 levels in SMB and SMB-PS cells suggested a reciprocal relationship between the two cleavage products in the prion-infected and uninfected states (Fig. 2b, lanes 3 and 7). In cured SMB-PS cells where C2 is not produced, C1 levels were 4.7 ± 1.6-fold higher (± S.E., n = 3 independent experiments) than in prion-infected SMB cells. To more fully characterize the relationship between C1 and C2 during prion infection, we analyzed the kinetics of C1 and C2 production in brains of mice inoculated with mouse-adapted RML scrapie prions. While C2 levels increased between 70 and 84 days postinoculation (Fig. 3a), the presence of cleavage products presumably corresponding to the PK-sensitive 21-kDa fragment present at low levels in uninfected mouse brain (Fig. 2a, lane 3) made the exact time of increased C2 production hard to determine. Nonetheless, as C2 levels continued to increase during prion infection, C1 levels correspondingly decreased at the end stage of disease by ∼3- and 4-fold at 126 and 140 days, respectively. PrP-(27–30) was first detected at 56 days (Fig. 3b) with substantial amounts appearing by 84 days. Resolving the various PrP-(27–30) glycoforms into a single PK-resistant, deglycosylated 21-kDa product resulted in PrPSc detection in brain extracts as early as 42-days postinoculation (Fig. 3c).Fig. 3Kinetics of PrPSc, C1, and C2 production in brain extracts from mice infected with RML prions.a, kinetics of full-length PrP, C1, and C2 accumulation. b, kinetics of PrP-(27–30) accumulation. c, kinetics of accumulation of deglycosylated, PK-resistant material.

Cells were treated with 20 μm cathepsin inhibitor III (Z-FG-NHO-BzOME), a cysteine protease inhibitor that selectively inhibits cathepsin B, cathepsin L, cathepsin S, and papain; 2 μm cathepsin L inhibitor III (Z-FY(t-Bu)-DMK) an irreversible inhibitor of cathepsin L; 20 μm caspase inhibitor III (Boc-D-FMK), a cell-permeable, irreversible, broad spectrum caspase inhibitor; 2 μm caspase 3 inhibitor III (Ac-DEVD-CMK) a potent and irreversible inhibitor of caspase-3 as well as caspase-6, caspase-7, caspase-8, and caspase-10; 1 μm of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (carbobenzoxyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinal-H); 5 μm lactacystin, a highly specific irreversible proteasome inhibitor; 50 μm of the calpain inhibitor MDL28170 (carbobenzoxy-valinyl-phenylalaninal); 50 μm of the calpain inhibitor calpeptin (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-norleucinal); and, 50 μm of calpain inhibitor IV (Z-LLY-FMK) a potent, cell-permeable, and irreversible calpain inhibitor. Only calpain inhibitors MDL28170, calpeptin, and calpain inhibitor IV inhibited production of C2 while inhibitors of lysosomal proteases, caspases, and the proteasome had no effect (Fig. 4, a and b). The irreversible calpain inhibitor IV was most effective resulting in apparently complete elimination of C2, whereas treatment with MDL28170 and calpeptin produced significant reductions in C2, averaging 63 ± 19.7% (±S.D., n = 3 independent experiments, p = 0.031) and 71 ± 7.1% (±S.D., n = 3 independent experiments, p = 0.0033), respectively (Fig. 4b). Since proteolysis by calpains features in a wide range of cellular functions, to ensure that SMB cells could tolerate the maximal concentrations of calpain inhibitors used in these experiments (50 μm) we monitored cell viability (Fig. 4c) and found no difference in cell survival between the inhibitor-treated and control-treated cultures, suggesting that reduced C2 production was not the result of a nonspecific effect of calpain inhibitors on cell toxicity.Fig. 4Treatment of prion-infected cells with inhibitors of cellular proteases indicates that production of C2 is mediated by calpains.a, detergent cell extracts were isolated from control Me2SO-treated SMB cells (DMSO) and SMB ce"

The pemI-pemK system is an addiction module present on plasmid R100. It helps to maintain the plasmid by post-segregational killing in E. coli population. Here we demonstrate that purified PemK, the toxin encoded by the pemI-pemK addiction module, inhibits protein synthesis in an E. coli cell-free system, whereas the addition of PemI, the antitoxin against PemK, resumes the protein synthesis. Further studies reveal that PemK is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves mRNAs to inhibit protein synthesis, whereas PemI blocks the endoribonuclease activity of PemK. PemK cleaves only single-stranded RNA preferentially at the 5′ or 3′ side of the A residue in the “UAH” sequences (where H is C, A, or U). Upon induction, PemK cleaves cellular mRNAs to effectively block protein synthesis in E. coli. The pemK homologue genes have been identified on the genomes of a wide range of bacteria.

Glaser G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 43-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The addiction module has the following properties. (a) The toxic protein is stable, whereas the antitoxin is a labile protein. (b) The toxin and the antitoxin are coexpressed from an operon and interact with each other to form a stable complex. (c) Their expression is auto-regulated either by the toxin-antitoxin complex or by the antitoxin alone. When the co-expression is inhibited under stress conditions, the antitoxin is degraded by proteases, enabling the toxin to act on its target. In E. coli, some extrachromosomal elements are known to contain addiction modules causing the bacterial programmed cell death by the so-called postsegregational killing effect.

CcdB, the toxin in the ccdA-ccdB system, interacts with DNA gyrase to block DNA replication (7Bahassi E.M. O'Dea M.H. Allali N. Messens J. Gellert M. Couturier M. J. Biol.

Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2003; 112: 131-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that the A-site mRNA cleavage can occur in the absence of RelE (30Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of the A-site mRNA cleavage is still unknown. It has been proposed that MazF (ChpAK), the toxin encoded by the mazEF system, and ChpBK, the toxin encoded by chpB system, inhibit translation by a mechanism very similar to that of RelE in a ribosome-dependent and codon-specific manner (28Christensen S.K. Pedersen K. Hansen F.G. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, we have recently demonstrated that MazF is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease functional only for single-stranded RNA, which preferentially cleaves mRNAs at the ACA sequence in a manner independent of ribosomes and codon, and is therefore functionally distinct from RelE (31Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The pemI-pemK system and the kis-kid system are involved in the stable maintenance of two closely related incFII low copy plasmids, plasmid R100 (14Tsuchimoto S. Nishimura Y. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4205-4211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tsuchimoto S. Ohtsubo H. Ohtsubo E. J.

Genet. 1987; 210: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), respectively. These two systems turned out to be identical (1Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 43-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that Kid (PemK) inhibits the ColE1 replication acting at the initiation of DNA synthesis but does not inhibit P4 DNA replication in vitro (12Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Gimenez-Gallego G. Sabariegos-Jareno R. Diaz-Orejas R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 568-577PubMed Google Scholar). It has not been shown whether Kid (PemK) inhibits the chromosome DNA replication. Toxin Kid (PemK) and antidote Kis (PemI) not only function in bacteria but also function efficiently in a wide range of eukaryotes. Kid (PemK) inhibits cell proliferation in yeast, Xenopus laevis, and human cells, and the inhibition was released by Kis (PemI) (33de la Cueva-Mendez G. Mills A.D. Clay-Farrace L. Diaz-Orejas R. Laskey R.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that Kid (PemK) triggers apoptosis in human cells (33de la Cueva-Mendez G. Mills A.D. Clay-Farrace L. Diaz-Orejas R. Laskey R.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results suggest that there is a common target for Kid (PemK) in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In this paper, we demonstrate that PemK is an endoribonuclease, which effectively blocks protein synthesis by cleaving cellular mRNAs in a sequence-specific manner. We propose that PemK and its homologues constitute a novel endoribonuclease family that interferes with mRNA function. Strains and Plasmids—E. coli BL21(DE3) and BW25113 cells were used. The pemIK gene was amplified by PCR with plasmid R100 as template and cloned into the NdeI-XhoI sites of pET21cc (Novagen) to create an in-frame translation with a (His)6 tag at the PemK C terminus. The plasmid was designated as pET21cc-IK(His)6. The pemI gene was cloned into the NdeI-BamHI sites of pET28a (Novagen), creating plasmid pET28a-(His)6I. PemI was expressed as a fusion with an N-terminal (His)6 tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site named (His)6PemI. The pemK gene cloned into pBAD (34Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar), creating plasmid pBAD-K. E. coli mazG gene was cloned into NdeI-BamHI sites of pET11a (New England Biolabs), creating plasmid pET11a-MazG. The mazG gene was cloned into a pINIII vector (35Nakano E.T. Rao M.M. Perucho M. Inouye M. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 302-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), creating plasmid pIN-MazG. E. coli era gene was cloned into the ScaI-XhoI sites of pET28a, creating plasmid pET28a-Era. The era gene was also cloned into pINIII vector to create plasmid pIN-Era. Protein Purification—For purification of (His)6PemI, pET28a-(His)6I was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) strain and (His)6PemI expression was induced with 1 mm IPTG 1The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; ORF, open reading frame; d, oligodeoxyribonucleotide. for 4 h. (His)6PemI protein was purified with use of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). pET21cc-IK(His)6 was also introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. The co-expression of PemI and PemK(His)6 was induced in the presence of 1 mm IPTG for 4 h. The PemI-PemK(His)6 complex was purified with the use of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen). To purify PemK(His)6 from the purified PemI-PemK(His)6 complex, PemI in the purified PemI-PemK(His)6 complex was dissociated from PemK(His)6 in 5 m guanidine HCl. PemK(His)6 was retrapped on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and then eluted and refolded by stepwise dialysis. Assays of Protein and DNA Syntheses in Vivo—E. coli BW25113 cells containing pBAD-K were grown in modified M9 medium with 0.5% glycerol (no glucose) and an amino acid mixture (1 mm each) without methionine. When the A600 of the culture reached 0.6, arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2% to induce PemK expression. Cell cultures (1 ml) were taken at the time points indicated and mixed with 5 μCi of [35S]methionine (protein synthesis) or 2 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (DNA synthesis). After 1-min incorporation at 37 °C, the rates of DNA replication and protein synthesis were determined as described previously (36Pedersen K. Christensen S.K. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). To prepare the samples for SDS-PAGE analysis of the total cellular protein synthesis, [35S]methionine incorporation reaction mixture (500 μl) was taken at the time points indicated and added into a chilled test tube containing 25 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid solution and 100 μg/ml non-radioactive methionine. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Primer Extension Analysis—The DNA fragment containing a T7 promoter and the mazG gene was obtained by PCR amplification with T7 primer d(AGATCTCGATCCCGCAAATTAAT) and primer G6 d(TTAGAGATCAATTTCCTGCCGTTTTAC) with pET11a-MazG as template. Another DNA fragment containing a T7 promoter and the era gene was obtained by PCR amplification with the same T7 primer above and primer E5 d(TTAAAGATCGTCAACGTAACCG) with pET28a-Era as template. The mazG mRNA and era mRNA were prepared from these two DNA fragments, respectively, using the T7 large-scale transcription kit (Promega). RNA substrates were partially digested with PemK(His)6 at 37 °C for 15 min. The digestion reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 4 μg of RNA substrate, 0.2 μg of PemK(His)6, 1 μl of RNase inhibitor, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Partial digestion products were purified with the RNeasy column (Qiagen) to remove PemK(His)6 protein. The primers G1 d(TGCTCTTTATCCCACGGGCAGC), G2 d(GCCCAGTTCACCGCGAAGATCGTC), G3 d(GGTTTTGATTTGCTCCCAACGGGCAAG), G4 d(CATTTCCTCCTCCAGTTTAGCCTGGTC), and G5 d(TTGCCAGACTTCTTCCATTGTTTCGAG) were used for primer extension analyses of the mazG RNA. The primers E1 d(GATCCCCACAATGCGGTGACGAGT), E2 d(CACGTTGTCCACTTTGTTCACC GC), E3 d(CAGTTCAGCGCCGAGGAAACGCAT), and E4 d(GCGTTCGTCGTCGGCCCAACCGGA) were used for primer extension analyses of the era RNA. The primers were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Primer extension reactions were performed at 42 °C for 1 h. The control experiments were performed under the same condition with the exception that PemK(His)6 was not added in the digestion reaction mixture. The primer extension product was analyzed on a 6% sequencing gel running along side by side with the DNA sequencing ladder prepared with the same primer. Cleavage of Synthesized RNA by PemK—The 30-base RNA (UAAGAAGGAGAUAUACAUAUGAAUCAAAUC), antisense RNA (GAUUUGAUUCAUAUGUAUAUCUCCUUCUUA), and the complementary DNA d(GATTTGATTCATATGTATATCTCCTTCTTA) were commercially synthesized. The 30-base RNA was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and used as the substrate to PemK(His)6. The cleavage products of the 30-base RNA were applied to a 20% sequencing gel (with 7 m urea) along with a RNA ladder, which was prepared by partial alkaline hydrolysis of the 5′ end-labeled 30-base RNA as described previously (37Smith J.S. Roth M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15071-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of the RNA-RNA duplex and RNA-DNA duplex formation on the PemK-mediated RNA cleavage were determined as described previously (31Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Northern Blot and Primer Extension Analyses of the PemK Effects on mRNAs in Vivo—pIN-MazG plasmid and pIN-Era plasmid were transformed into E. coli BW25113 containing pBAD-K, creating the BW25113/pBAD-K/pIN-MazG and BW25113/pBAD-K/pIN-Era strains, respectively. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml). When the A600 value reached 0.4, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce the synthesis of the mazG or era mRNA. After another 30-min incubation at 37 °C, arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2% to induce the expression of PemK. The samples were taken at different time intervals after the induction of PemK. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the hot-phenol method as described previously (38Sarmientos P. Sylvester J.E. Contente S. Cashel M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1337-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment containing the full-length ORF of the mazG or era gene was used to prepare the radioactively labeled probe, which was used in the Northern blot analysis. Primer extension analysis was performed with primer G2 (for the mazG mRNA) or E1 (for the era mRNA). To detect the lpp mRNA, total cellular RNA was extracted from E. coli BW25113/pBAD-K at various time points after the addition of arabinose and subjected to Northern blot analysis using the radiolabeled lpp ORF DNA fragment as probe. The primer extension analysis of the lpp mRNA was performed with primer lpp-C d(AGAATGTGCGCCATTTTTCACT). The Effects of PemK on DNA and Protein Syntheses in Vivo— The pemK gene was cloned into pBAD vector (34Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar), creating plasmid pBAD-K, which was transformed into E. coli BW25113. The expression of PemK in BW25113/pBAD-K was induced by the addition of arabinose to a final concentration of 0.2%. After the induction of PemK, the rates of DNA replication and protein synthesis were measured at various time points as indicated in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively. Both DNA replication and protein synthesis were affected by the induction of PemK, but DNA replication was inhibited at a significant slower rate than protein synthesis. Protein synthesis was rapidly reduced by ∼50% at 10 min after the induction of PemK, whereas it took approximately 100 min for similar inhibition of DNA replication. As shown in Fig. 1C, SDS-PAGE analysis of total cellular protein synthesis at different time points after the induction of PemK indicates that PemK is a general inhibitor for the synthesis of cellular proteins. After the induction of PemK, the intensity of a band indicated by an arrow increased from 0 to 30 min and then decreased. On the basis of its molecular mass, this band probably represents the induced PemK protein. PemK Inhibits Protein Synthesis in a Cell-free System— PemK(His)6 (C-terminally tagged) was purified from E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pET21cc-IK(His)6 co-expressing both PemI and PemK(His)6 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” (His)6PemI (N-terminally tagged) was purified from E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pET28a-(His)6I. PemK(His)6 and (His)6PemI are referred to as PemK and PemI, respectively, in the following in vitro experiments. To determine whether PemK inhibits protein synthesis, we examined the effects of purified PemK on the synthesis of MazG and (His)6Era in an E. coli cell-free RNA/protein synthesis system. The synthesis of MazG from plasmid pET11a-MazG and the synthesis of (His)6Era from plasmid pET28a-Era were carried out at 37 °C for 1 h using E. coli T7 S30 extract system (Promega) in the absence of PemK (Fig. 2A, lane 1) or in the presence of increasing amounts of PemK (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–5). Both MazG and (His)6Era synthesis were blocked by PemK in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrate that PemK indeed inhibits protein synthesis, consistent with the PemK-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis observed in vivo (Fig. 1, B and C). The delayed PemK-mediated inhibition of DNA replication observed in vivo (Fig. 1A) thus is speculated to be due to a secondary effect of the inhibition of cellular protein synthesis. Interestingly, the addition of the antitoxin PemI blocked the PemK-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis and resumed MazG and (His)6Era synthesis in a PemI dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). It should be noted that preincubation of the E. coli cell-free system with PemK for 15 min at 37 °C did not have a significant adverse effect on (His)6Era synthesis if PemI was added together with the plasmid DNA after the 15-min preincubation (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 3). However, in the absence of PemI, no protein was produced (Fig. 2C, lane 2). (His)6Era synthesis was resumed regardless of whether PemI was added after the 15-min preincubation with PemK (Fig. 2C, lane 3), or it was added together with PemK during the 15-min preincubation (Fig. 2C, lane 4). These results suggest that the primary target of PemK is mRNAs but not tRNA, ribosomes, or any other factors that are required for protein synthesis in the cell-free system. Endoribonuclease Activity of PemK—The DNA fragment containing a T7 promoter and the mazG gene was obtained by PCR amplification using the plasmid pET11a-MazG as a template as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Similarly, another DNA fragment containing a T7 promoter and the era gene was obtained with the plasmid pET28a-Era as a template. The mazG mRNA and the era mRNA were then prepared from these two DNA fragments, respectively, using the T7 large-scale transcription kit (Promega). The mazG mRNA was digested into smaller fragments after incubation with PemK at 37 °C for 15 min (Fig. 3A, lane 2), whereas the addition of PemI inhibited the cleavage of mazG mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, lanes 3–6). PemI itself had no effect on the mazG mRNA (Fig. 3A, lane 7). A similar result was obtained with the era mRNA as substrate (data not shown). These results demonstrate that PemK is an endoribonuclease that cleaves mRNA to inhibit protein synthesis and that PemI functions as an antitoxin to block the endoribonuclease activity of PemK. The fact that the digestion products of mazG mRNA by PemK form distinct bands on a 3.5% polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3A) indicates that PemK cleaves RNA at specific sites. The mazG mRNA was partially digested by PemK and then subjected to primer extension using five different oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers, G1–G5, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A number of specific cleavage sites along the mazG mRNA were detected on a 6% sequence gel compared with the controls without PemK treatment (data not shown). Partially digested era mRNA by PemK was also subjected to primer extension using four different primers, E1–E4, as described under “Experimental Procedures” to detect the PemK cleavage sites along the era mRNA. To determine the exact sequence around the PemK cleavage sites, each primer extension product was analyzed on a 6% sequencing gel with the DNA sequencing ladder prepared with the same primer (Fig. 3, B–E). Table I shows the sequences around the major cleavage sites in the mazG mRNA, the era mRNA, and the lpp mRNA (see Fig. 5D for the lpp mRNA) determined by the primer extension experiments. It reveals that a UA dinucleotide is common in all but one cleavage site and that the primary cleavages occur at the 5′ or 3′ side of the A residue in the UAH sequence (where H is C, A, or U) with only one exception in which the cleavage occurs between U and G residues in the UGC sequence (Table I, row 7). The UAC sequence appears at 11 of the 18 cleavage sites determined.Table ImRNA sequences around the PemK cleavage sitesGene namesPrimermRNA sequences around the cleavage sitesmazGG1-27UUUUAACUUU ↓ A AGAAGGAGA-8-14AAGGAGAUAU ↓ A CAUAUGAAT+6G2+112GAAGAAACCU A↓CGAAGUGCU+131G3+196GUGGUGUUUU ↓ A CGCGCAAAU+215+234CUUUGACUUU ↓ A AUGAUAUUU+253+240CUUUAAUGAU ↓ A UUUGCGCUG+259+290CGCAUGUUUU ↓ G CUGAUAGUU+309G4+523GAGGUGAUGU A↓CGAAGCGCG+542G5+597UGCCACGGUU ↓ A AUCUGGCUC+616+684AGUGGAGCGU ↓ A UUGUUGCCG+703eraE1+10GATAAAAGUU ↓ A CUGCGGAUU+29E2+144GGGGAUCCAU ↓ A CUGAAGGCG+163+169CAGGCGAUCU ↓ A CGUCGAUAC+188E3+509GUAAGCAUCU ↓ A CCUGAAGCG+528+541CCGGAAGAUU ↓ A CAUCACCGA+560E4+625GAACUGCCGU A↓CUCCGUGAC+644+676CGCGGUGGUU ↓ A UGACAUCAA+695lpplppC+210CAACAUGGCU A↓CTAAATACC+229 Open table in a new tab A 30-base RNA substrate was designed on the basis of the sequence around one PemK cleavage site in the mazG mRNA that contains a UAC sequence (Table I, row 2). The RNA was labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The 30-base RNA was cleaved equally well at either 5′ or 3′ side of the A residue (residue 15 in the 30-base RNA) in the UAC sequence (Fig. 4A). However, in the primer extension experiment using the full-length mazG mRNA, this UAC sequence was cleaved only at the 5′ side of the A residue (Fig. 3B). It is interesting to note that, for the full-length mazG RNA, PemK cleavages can happen at the 3′ side of the A residue in some cleavage sites, whereas in the other cleavage sites, cleavages can happen at the 5′ side (Table I). The reason for these different cleavage patterns is unknown at present. On a 15% native PAGE, the cleavage products from the 30-base RNA migrated as a single band (Fig. 4B, lane 2). When the antisense RNA was annealed with the 30-base RNA substrate in different ratios before the addition of PemK, it blocked the RNA cleavage in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B, lanes 3–7). A similar result was obtained when the 30-base RNA substrate formed a duplex with its complementary DNA (data not shown). These results indicate that the PemK cleavage sites in the 30-base RNA substrate became protected in the RNA-RNA and RNA-DNA duplexes. Therefore, we conclude that PemK is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease for single-stranded RNA. In Vivo mRNA Cleavage upon the Induction of PemK—To examine the effect of PemK on mRNAs in vivo, Northern blot and primer extension analyses were performed with the total cellular RNA extracted at different time points after the induction of PemK as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 16 and 23 S rRNAs were stable against PemK in vivo, because no significant changes were observed in their band intensities in 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in the total cellular RNA samples during the 60-min period after the induction of PemK (data not shown). This finding indicates that in vivo both 16 and 23 S rRNA are well protected from PemK cleavage. Fig. 5A shows the Northern blot analyses of the mazG, era, and lpp mRNAs at the various time points with or without the induction of PemK. The mazG mRNA and the era mRNA were produced, respectively, from pIN-MazG and pIN-Era in the presence of 1 mm IPTG for 30 min before the addition of arabinose (the final concentration of 0.2%) to induce PemK expression. The lpp mRNA was transcribed from the E. coli chromosome. All of the three mRNAs were degraded after a 10-min induction of PemK expression, whereas no changes were observed during the 60-min incubation without the induction of PemK (Fig. 5A). In comparison with the mazG and lpp mRNAs, the era mRNA was mostly converted to a smaller distinct band, which was comparatively stable during the 60-min induction of PemK. The nature of this stable mRNA cleavage product is unknown. Primer extension experiments were also carried out to determine the PemK cleavage sites in mRNAs in vivo. One cleavage site for each mRNA is shown in Fig. 5, B–D, for mazG, era, and lpp, respectively. In all of the cases, a band appeared at 10 min after the induction of PemK (lane 2 in Fig. 5, B–D) whose intensity further increased during the 60-min induction of PemK (lanes 2–6). Importantly, the band was hardly detected at 0 min (lane 1), clearly demonstrating that the observed cleavages were caused by the induction of PemK. Both the mazG and lpp mRNAs were cleaved between the A and C residues in the UAC sequence, whereas the era mRNA was cleaved between the U and A residues. The mazG mRNA was cleaved at the identical site in vivo and in vitro (compare Fig. 3C and Fig. 5B). The in vivo cleavage of the era mRNA also occurred at the same site as detected in vitro with use of the same primer (compare Fig. 3D with Fig. 5C). The cleaved UAC sequences in the mazG and the era mRNAs are in the reading frame of the both ORFs, encoding Tyr-41 in MazG and Tyr-7 in Era, whereas the cleaved UAC sequence in the lpp mRNA is between two adjacent codons, GCU for Ala-73 and ACU for Thr-74. The in vivo mRNA cleavages by PemK were very specific because no other cleavages were detected in Fig. 5, B–D. Therefore, unlike RelE that stimulates codon-specific mRNA cleavage at the A site on ribosomes (20Christensen S.K. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1389-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 21Pedersen K. Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M.

Cell. 2003; 12: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), PemK is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease inhibiting protein synthesis by cleaving mRNAs in a manner independent of ribosomes and codon-reading frames. In this paper, we demonstrate that PemK, the toxin encoded by the pemI-pemK addiction module, is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease. Both in vitro and in vivo studies support that PemK inhibits protein synthesis by cleaving mRNAs at specific sites. Purified PemK inhibits protein synthesis in an E. coli cell-free system, whereas the addition of PemI is able to block the inhibitory effect of PemK and resume protein synthesis. Further, we demonstrate that mRNAs are degraded by PemK and that the PemK-mediated mRNA cleavage is inhibited by PemI. Therefore, PemI functions as an antitoxin to block the endoribonuclease activity of PemK by the formation of a PemI-PemK complex. PemK was found to be highly specific to single-stranded RNA, because the PemK-mediated RNA cleavage was blocked when an RNA substrate was annealed with its antisense RNA or complementary DNA to form an RNA-RNA or RNA-DNA duplex. The present results demonstrate that PemK cleaves preferentially at the 5′ or 3′ side of the A residue in UAH sequences (where H is C, A, or U). It remains to be determined how the phosphodiester bond is cleaved either at the 3′ end of the bond or at the 5′ end of the bond. Our results also show that the RNA cleavage by PemK is independent of ribosomes, which is distinctly different from RelE, the toxin encoded by the relBE addiction module. RelE is not able to cleave free RNA but stimulates mRNA cleavage at the ribosome A site with a high codon specificity (20Christensen S.K. Gerdes K. Mol.

In the previous study on the kis-kid system, which is an addiction module identical to the pemI-pemK system, it has been reported that Kid (PemK) inhibits the in vitro ColE1 replication at the initiation stage but has no significant effect on the P4 DNA replication. DnaB has been proposed as the target for the inhibitory action of Kid (PemK) (12Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Gimenez-Gallego G. Sabariegos-Jareno R. Diaz-Orejas R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 568-577PubMed Google Scholar). However, so far there have been no data to support the interaction between Kid (PemK) and DnaB. It is interesting to note that the ColE1 replication is initiated by RNA II and inhibited by RNA I (39Cesareni G. Helmer-Citterich M. Castagnoli L. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 230-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 40Davison J. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas the P4 DNA replication is mainly regulated by α protein (41Briani F. Deho G. Forti F. Ghisotti D. Plasmid. 2001; 45: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RNases involved in the metabolism of RNA I and RNA II are expected to play a key role in the control of the ColE1 plasmid replication (42Jung Y.H. Lee Y. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 22: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). RNA II contains several UAC sequences, two of which exist in the loop regions of the first and second stem-loop structures (43Tomizawa J.I. Itoh T. Cell. 1982; 31: 575-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 44Tomizawa J. Cell. 1984; 38: 861-870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibition of ColE1 DNA replication by Kid (PemK) is probably because of degradation of RNA II by its endoribonuclease activity. Furthermore, the fact that Kid (PemK), a toxin in bacteria, inhibits the growth of various eukaryotic cells (33de la Cueva-Mendez G. Mills A.D. Clay-Farrace L. Diaz-Orejas R. Laskey R.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) can be readily explained by its endoribonuclease activity against cellular mRNAs rather than by its interaction with DnaB. PemK homologues are identified in a wide range of bacteria. MazF (ChpAK) and ChpBK are the two PemK-like proteins in E. coli (26Santos Sierra S. Giraldo R. Diaz Orejas R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 51-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Masuda Y. Miyakawa K. Nishimura Y. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6850-6856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Christensen S.K. Pedersen K. Hansen F.G. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). MazF (ChpAK), the toxin encoded by the mazEF addiction module, is 25% identical with PemK. ChpBK, the toxin encoded by the chpB addiction module, is 41% identical with PemK. It had been demonstrated that MazF (ChpAK) and ChpBK inhibit translation by cleaving mRNAs in a manner similar to RelE (28Christensen S.K. Pedersen K. Hansen F.G. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have recently demonstrated that MazF is an endoribonuclease that acts independently of ribosomes and inhibits protein synthesis by sequence specifically cleaving single-stranded mRNA (31Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). MazF preferentially cleaves mRNA between A and C residues at the ACA sequence (31Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrated that PemK is a different endoribonuclease from MazF having a different sequence specificity. However, because MazF and PemK are folded in a similar three-dimensional structure (24Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), these two endoribonucleases are likely to bind to RNA substrates and to hydrolyze them in a similar manner. The crystal structure of Kid (PemK) protein has been determined as a homodimer (11Hargreaves D. Santos-Sierra S. Giraldo R. Sabariegos-Jareno R. de la Cueva-Mendez G. Boelens R. Diaz-Orejas R. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1425-1433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 45Hargreaves D. Giraldo R. Santos-Sierra S. Boelens R. Rice D.W. Diaz Orejas R. Rafferty J.B. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although the structure of MazF has not been determined, Kamada et al. (24Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) have reported the crystal structure of the MazE-MazF complex (MazF2-MazE2-MazF2), which was formed by two MazF homodimers and one MazE homodimer. Interestingly, the structure of the Kid (PemK) homodimer and that of the MazF homodimer in the MazE-MazF complex are similar. However, the conserved loops between β strands S1 and S2 (termed the S1-S2 loops) in the MazE-bound MazF homodimer that project into solvent are mostly disordered, whereas in the Kid (PemK) homodimer, the two corresponding loops are in a “closed” conformation (24Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The S1-S2 loops in the structure of the Kid (PemK) homodimer form a cavity-like structure covering a basic surface and a conserved hydrophobic pocket. The conserved hydrophobic pocket plays an essential role in the recognition of MazE in the MazE-MazF complex formation (24Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the highly negative charged C-terminal extension of MazE may mimic the single-stranded RNA, which binds between the S1-S2 loops in the MazF homodimer (31Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). PemI is assumed to bind to PemK in a very similar manner to block the endoribonuclease activity of PemK. The determination of the crystal structure of the PemK·RNA complex will shed light onto our understanding of the exact molecular mechanism of its sequence-specific endoribonuclease activity. Both PemK and MazF have now been characterized as sequence-specific endoribonucleases for single-stranded RNA; however, their physiological function appears to be distinct from other known endoribonucleases such as RNase E, A, and T1, because PemK and MazF function as general protein synthesis inhibitors by interfering with the function of cellular mRNAs. It is well known that the small RNAs, such as micRNA (mRNA-interfering-complementary RNA) (46Mizuno T. Chou M.Y. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1966-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), miRNA (47Ambros V. Cell. 2001; 107: 823-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar), and siRNA (48Billy E. Brondani V. Zhang H. Muller U. Filipowicz W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), interfere with the function of the specific target RNAs. The ribozyme also acts on the target RNA specifically and interferes with its function (49Puerta-Fernandez E. Romero-Lopez C. Barroso-del Jesus A. Berzal-Herranz A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 75-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We propose that PemK and the PemK homologues form a novel endoribonuclease family with a new mRNA-interfering mechanism by cleaving mRNAs at specific sequences, which could be termed as “mRNA interferase.” mRNA interferases may be useful to detect the second structures in RNA, because both PemK and MazF are able to cleave only single-stranded RNAs. As reported previously, Kid (PemK) triggers apoptosis in human cancer cells, whereas Kis (PemI) inhibits the toxic effect of Kid (PemK) (33de la Cueva-Mendez G. Mills A.D. Clay-Farrace L. Diaz-Orejas R. Laskey R.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, this new regulatable mRNA-interfering system could be used for the gene therapy for human diseases. We thank Dr. Sangita Phadtare for assistance in preparation of the paper. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2064954087,"Many signaling receptors require covalent modification by ubiquitin for agonist-induced down-regulation via endocytic trafficking to lysosomes, a process that is mediated by a conserved set of endosome-associating proteins also required for vacuolar protein-sorting (VPS) in yeast. The delta opioid receptor (DOR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that can undergo agonist-induced proteolysis via endocytic trafficking to lysosomes but does not require covalent modification by ubiquitin to do so. This raises the question of whether lysosomal down-regulation of this “ubiquitination-independent” GPCR is mediated by a completely distinct biochemical mechanism or if similar VPS machinery is involved. Agonist-induced proteolysis of DOR was significantly inhibited by dominant negative mutant versions of Vps4/Skd1, an AAA-family ATPase required for a late step in lysosomal sorting of ubiquitinated membrane cargo. Furthermore, overexpression and interfering RNA-mediated knockdown indicated that lysosomal trafficking of opioid receptors is also dependent on Hrs, a VPS protein that mediates an early step in lysosomal sorting of ubiquitinated cargo. However, interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Tsg101, a VPS protein that is essential for an intermediate step of the conserved lysosomal sorting mechanism, did not detectably affect agonist-induced proteolysis of DOR in the same cells in which (ubiquitination-dependent) lysosomal trafficking of epidermal growth factor receptors was clearly inhibited. These results indicate that opioid receptors, despite their ability to undergo efficient agonist-induced trafficking to lysosomes in the absence of covalent modification by ubiquitin, utilize some (Vps4 and Hrs) but perhaps not all (Tsg101) of the VPS machinery required for lysosomal sorting of ubiquitinated membrane cargo.

Endocytosis can lead to diverse functional consequences depending on the subsequent sorting of endocytosed receptors between divergent downstream membrane pathways. For example, trafficking of endocytosed receptors via a rapid recycling pathway returns them to the plasma membrane in a functionally active state, promoting recovery (or resensitization) of cellular signal transduction (4Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 5Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin.

Alternatively, trafficking of endocytosed receptors to lysosomes leads to proteolytic down-regulation of receptors and a prolonged attenuation of cell signaling. It is clear that GPCRs can be “sorted” selectively between these divergent membrane pathways (7Tsao P. Cao T. von Zastrow M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 91-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), but, despite considerable recent progress (8Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P.

Cell. 2002; 13: 1965-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the biochemical machinery mediating lysosomal sorting of GPCRs in mammalian cells remains poorly defined. Genetic and biochemical studies in yeast have led to a molecular model of GPCR trafficking to the vacuole, a proteolytic compartment similar to the mammalian lysosome (12Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 13Strous G.J. Govers R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hicke L.

A key event in this mechanism is the modification of membrane proteins with ubiquitin, a highly conserved 76-residue protein that is attached to the ϵ-amino group of cytoplasmic lysine residues via enzyme-catalyzed isopeptide bond formation (16Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Hofmann K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Modification of the yeast GPCR Ste2p with a single ubiquitin chain is sufficient to promote endocytic trafficking to the vacuole (12Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), distinguishing this role of mono-ubiquitination in vacuolar targeting from that of polyubiquitination, which targets various soluble and membrane proteins to the proteasome (17Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A large number of genes have been identified that are required for trafficking of ubiquitinated membrane proteins to the vacuole (18Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 19Rothman J.H. Howald I. Stevens T.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Two of the protein products of Class E vacuolar protein-sorting (VPS) genes, Vps27p and Vps23p, are thought to function in sequence in the vacuolar sorting mechanism and bind directly to ubiquitinated membrane cargo via ubiquitin-interacting domains. These critical VPS proteins are organized into large multiprotein complexes that are recruited to the endosome membrane in a sequential manner and promote vacuolar sorting by a multistep mechanism requiring the Vps4p AAA family ATPase at a late step, probably to disassociate the endosome-associated protein complexes and thus allow subsequent rounds of sorting to occur. This has led to a model for ubiquitinated protein sorting in diverse organisms mediated by a series of multiprotein “ESCRT” complexes (20Babst M. Sato T.K. Banta L.M. Emr S.D.

Mammalian homologues of most of the yeast VPS genes have been identified, and extensive studies of ligand-induced down-regulation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase have established this receptor as a model for VPS protein function in mammalian cells. Down-regulation of EGF receptors is mediated by ligand-induced endocytosis followed by receptor sorting to lysosomes (26Sorkin A. Waters C.M. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Sorting of internalized EGF receptors to lysosomes requires ubiquitination of the receptor (by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl (27Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L.

Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 747-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As for Vps27p in yeast, Hrs associates with endosome membranes through an interaction with phosphoinositides and is thought to function at an early stage in the sorting mechanism by binding directly to ubiquitinated cargo (34Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Gillooly D.J. Madshus I.H. Stang E. Stenmark H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Hrs is then thought to recruit additional sorting proteins to the endosome membrane by directly binding to Tsg101 (35Lu Q. Hope L.W. Brasch M. Reinhard C. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7626-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 36Bache K.G. Brech A. Mehlum A. Stenmark H. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As in yeast, mammalian Vps4 is critical for lysosomal trafficking of receptors and is thought to function at a later stage in the sorting mechanism that does not involve direct binding to ubiquitinated cargo. Hence Hrs, Tsg101, and Vps4 are thought to function sequentially on the endosome membrane to mediate a multistep mechanism by which ubiquitinated EGF receptors are sorted to lysosomes (38Raiborg C. Rusten T.E. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 39Sorkin A. Von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination-dependent trafficking of GPCRs to the yeast vacuole requires the same VPS proteins involved in vacuolar sorting of other ubiquitinated membrane cargo (22Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 40Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Certain mammalian GPCRs also require covalent modification by ubiquitin for endocytic trafficking to lysosomes (9Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 10Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). An interesting observation from recent studies is that not all mammalian GPCRs require ubiquitination to traffic to lysosomes. A lysine-mutant version of the delta opioid receptor, which is unable to be covalently modified by ubiquitin, was observed to undergo efficient ligand-induced trafficking to lysosomes in HEK293 cells (41Tanowitz M.B. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50219-50222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These results, together with evidence that non-covalent interactions of mammalian GPCRs with distinct non-VPS proteins can modulate their lysosomal trafficking (8Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S.R. Von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 11Wang Y. Zhou Y. Szabo K. Haft C.R. Trejo J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1965-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), raise fundamental questions about the mechanism by which non-ubiquitinated GPCRs traffic to lysosomes. Namely, is the biochemical machinery mediating “ubiquitination-independent” lysosomal trafficking of GPCRs in mammalian cells completely distinct from the VPS protein-mediated mechanism, or is shared VPS machinery involved? If shared machinery is involved, are there any differences in the requirement of specific VPS proteins that might distinguish ubiquitination-independent lysosomal sorting of opioid receptors from ubiquitination-dependent sorting of EGF receptors? We have addressed these questions by investigating the role of Hrs, Tsg101, and Vps4 in lysosomal trafficking of DOR in stably transfected HeLa cells, a cell line in which these mammalian VPS proteins are well established to be required for ubiquitination-dependent lysosomal sorting of EGF receptors (28Bache K.G.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Our studies confirm in this cell type, as shown previously in HEK293 cells (41Tanowitz M.B. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50219-50222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), that agonist-induced proteolysis of DOR via endocytic trafficking to lysosomes can occur efficiently in the absence of receptor ubiquitination. Nevertheless, this process is strongly dependent on Vps4 and Hrs, but is apparently independent of the core ESCRT protein Tsg101. To our knowledge, the present results are the first to demonstrate a role of mammalian Class E VPS homologue in the lysosomal trafficking of a non-ubiquitinated GPCR, and they suggest an unexpected distinction between the biochemical requirements for lysosomal trafficking of ubiquitination-dependent and -independent membrane cargo. Cell Culture, cDNA Constructs, and Transfection—The myc-tagged Hrs construct and anti-Hrs antibody were a gift from Harald Stenmark (Norwegian Radium Hospital, Norway), and the Vps4-GFP, Vps4 E228Q-GFP, and Vps4 K173Q-GFP constructs were a gift from Wes Sundquist (University of Utah School of Medicine). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (University of California, San Francisco, Cell Culture Facility). FLAG-tagged versions of the cloned murine DOR and the cytoplasmic-lysine deleted DOR (DOR-0cK) were generated as previously described (41Tanowitz M.B. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50219-50222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and the cDNAs for both DOR and DOR-0cK were subcloned into pIRESneo3 (Clontech) for generation of stable cell lines. Stably transfected cells expressing epitope-tagged receptors were generated by selection for neomycin resistance using 750 μg/ml G418. Neomycin-resistant colonies were isolated and selected based on receptor expression levels (assessed by fluorescence microscopy and Western blot of cell lysate using the M1 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma)). Saturation analysis by radioligand binding studies using [3H]diprenorphine (Amersham Biosciences) revealed the receptor expression level corresponds to 5-10 pmol of receptor/mg of membrane protein for the DOR and 1-5 pmol/mg for the DOR-0cK. For transient expression of myc-Hrs or Vps4 constructs, cells were transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells expressing FLAG-tagged receptors were harvested by trypsinization and plated in 12-well plates at 80% confluency, before transfection with plasmid DNA. Cells were cultured for a further 48 h before experimentation. Knockdown of Tsg101 and Hrs using RNA oligonucleotides (42Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar) was achieved by transfection of duplex RNA oligonucleotides (Qiagen) corresponding to part of the coding region of human Tsg101 or human Hrs as previously described (28Bache K.G.

Cells were plated in 12-well plates at 90% confluency before transfection with duplex RNA strands and carrier plasmid DNA (pcDNA3.0, Invitrogen). Control cells were transfected with nonsense duplex RNA oligonucleotides (AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACG, Qiagen). 24 h later a second identical transfection was carried out, and the cells were left for a further 24 h before experimentation. Western Blotting for Total Receptor Levels—Immunoblotting of total receptor levels was as previously described (41Tanowitz M.B. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50219-50222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected as described, and stimulated before washing three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in extraction buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min) and then mixed with SDS sample buffer for denaturation. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed for FLAG-tagged receptor (M1 antibody, Sigma), EGF receptor (sc-03, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Tsg101 (sc-7964, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or Hrs by immunoblotting using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG or donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), and SuperSignal detection reagent (Pierce). Band intensities of unsaturated immunoblots were analyzed and quantified by densitometry using FluorChem 2.0 software (AlphaInnotech Corp.). The amount of FLAG-DOR remaining at each time point was first expressed as a percentage of the amount of FLAG-DOR in the identically transfected unstimulated cells. Data were also expressed as a ratio of transfected cells over control transfected cells for each time point. Assuming there is no difference in receptor levels between the control cells and transfected cells, the ratio would be 1. If the rate of degradation is unaffected by expression of mutants or siRNA transfection, the ratio after 4-h agonist treatment will be unchanged from that in unstimulated cells. Data were pooled across experiments, and statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. A previously described cell surface biotinylation assay was used to establish FLAG-tagged receptors present at the cell surface (41Tanowitz M.B. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50219-50222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, stably transfected HeLa cells were grown on 60-mm dishes, washed with ice-cold PBS, and incubated with 300 μg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C to biotinylate surface proteins. Following washing with Tris-buffered saline to quench unreacted biotin, cells were returned to 37 °C for incubation in media, with or without agonist, before extraction as described above. Biotinylated proteins were isolated from cell extract by immobilization on streptavidin-conjugated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Washed beads were eluted with SDS sample buffer before resolving by SDS-PAGE as above. Fluorescence Microscopy—Colocalization of receptors with lysosomes was visualized using an antibody feeding method. Briefly, cells were plated onto glass coverslips, and surface receptors were labeled by the addition of anti-FLAG antibody to the media. Cells were then incubated for 60 min in the presence of agonist at 37 °C, before fixing with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, and processed for immunocytochemical staining as previously described (41Tanowitz M.B. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50219-50222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Lysosomes were localized using lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) monoclonal antibody obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Data Bank. To examine colocalization with Hrs, surface receptors were again labeled by the addition of anti-FLAG antibody to the media. Cells were then incubated for 15 min in the presence of agonist at 37 °C, and cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin prior to fixation with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Hrs was detected using anti-Hrs antibody (supplied by Harald Stenmark (31Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Mehlum A. Stang E. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5008-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar)). Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope fitted with a Zeiss 63× numerical aperture 1.4 objective operated in single photon mode with standard filter sets and standard (1 Airy disc) pinhole.

Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50219-50222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This raised the question of whether ubiquitination-independent lysosomal trafficking of this GPCR is a peculiarity of a single cell type or may be a more general property of receptor trafficking in mammalian cells. To address this we examined the endocytic trafficking of epitope-tagged DOR expressed in HeLa cells, another human cell line in which ubiquitination-dependent lysosomal trafficking of other signaling receptors is well established (28Bache K.G.

FLAG-tagged DOR, expressed at moderate levels in stably transfected HeLa cells (see “Experimental Procedures”), was detected in cell lysates by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The FLAG-DOR resolved as a heterogeneous protein band, with a prominent immunoreactive protein species resolving between 50 and 60 kDa, consistent with the mature DOR glycoprotein (Fig. 1A) (44Petaja-Repo U.E.

This immunoreactive band was not detected in untransfected HeLa cells (not shown), confirming that it represents the expressed FLAG-DOR protein. The amount of immunoreactive FLAG-DOR detected in cell lysates was greatly diminished within several hours after addition of opioid agonist (10 μm DADLE) to the culture medium (Fig. 1A). This prominent band (indicated by the bracket in Fig. 1A) was analyzed by densitometry, and quantification of the results of multiple experiments indicated that FLAG-DOR exhibited agonist-induced proteolysis with a t1/2 of ∼2 h (Fig. 1B). This is closely comparable to the proteolysis rate observed in HEK293 cells (8Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S.R. Von Zastrow M. S"

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor and plays an important role in growth, differentiation, and inflammation in different tissues. Here, we examined the effect of PPARγ ligands on interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced mPGES-1 expression in human synovial fibroblasts. PPARγ ligands 15-deoxy-Δ12,14 prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and the thiazolidinedione troglitazone (TRO), but not PPARα ligand Wy14643, dose-dependently suppressed IL-1β-induced PGE2 production, as well as mPGES-1 protein and mRNA expression. 15d-PGJ2 and TRO suppressed IL-1β-induced activation of the mPGES-1 promoter. Overexpression of wild-type PPARγ further enhanced, whereas overexpression of a dominant negative PPARγ alleviated, the suppressive effect of both PPARγ ligands. Furthermore, pretreatment with an antagonist of PPARγ, GW9662, relieves the suppressive effect of PPARγ ligands on mPGES-1 protein expression, suggesting that the inhibition of mPGES-1 expression is mediated by PPARγ. We demonstrated that PPARγ ligands suppressed Egr-1-mediated induction of the activities of the mPGES-1 promoter and of a synthetic reporter construct containing three tandem repeats of an Egr-1 binding site. The suppressive effect of PPARγ ligands was enhanced in the presence of a PPARγ expression plasmid. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays for Egr-1 binding sites in the mPGES-1 promoter showed that both 15d-PGJ2 and TRO suppressed IL-1β-induced DNA-binding activity of Egr-1. These data define mPGES-1 and Egr-1 as novel targets of PPARγ and suggest that inhibition of mPGES-1 gene transcription may be one of the mechanisms by which PPARγ regulates inflammatory responses.

Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 33: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of PGE2 requires two enzymes. Cyclooxygenase (COX; also termed PGH synthase) converts arachidonic acid into PGH2. Subsequently, PGE synthase (PGES) converts COX-2-derived PGH2 to PGE2. Two isoforms of COX exist, COX-1 and COX-2, with similar enzymatic properties but distinctly different biological functions. COX-1 is expressed in most tissues and is responsible for physiological production of PGs. COX-2, in contrast, is almost undetectable under physiological conditions but is strongly induced in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, growth factors, and mitogens (1Crosby C.G. DuBois R.N.

Therefore, mPGES-1 may constitute a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a family of ligand-activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily (19Fahmi H. Pelletier J.P. Martel-Pelletier J. J. Rheumatol. 2002; 29: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). To date, three PPAR subtypes have been identified: PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ. PPARα is highly expressed in the liver, heart, kidney, and intestinal mucosa, where its regulates lipid metabolism. PPARγ is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and regulates adipocyte differentiation. PPARα is activated by eicosanoids, fatty acids, and the hypolipidemic drug Wy14643 (selective for PPARα). PPARγ is activated by the prostaglandin D2 metabolite 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) and synthetic anti-diabetic thiazolidinedione drugs (e.g. troglitazone) (19Fahmi H. Pelletier J.P. Martel-Pelletier J. J. Rheumatol. 2002; 29: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence that PPARα and PPARγ are implicated as important regulators of immune and inflammatory responses. PPARα activation inhibits inflammatory mediators release from several cell types (20Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J.

In addition, PPARα-deficient mice exhibit exacerbated inflammatory responses (23Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). PPARγ activation results in the inhibition of various inflammatory events, such as the production of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in monocytes/macrophages as well as the proliferation and the production of IL-2 by T lymphocytes (24Ricote M.

Moreover, we have observed that PPARγ ligands can suppress the expression of the inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), MMP-13, and COX-2 in human chondrocytes and the expression of MMP-1 in human synovial fibroblasts (19Fahmi H.

These actions of PPARγ ligands were proven through repression of activities of many transcription factors, including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), activator protein 1, signal transducers and activators of transcription, and nuclear factor of activated T cells (19Fahmi H.

To date, limited information is available on the effect of PPARγ ligands on the induction of mPGES-1. Here, we analyze the effect of two PPARγ ligands, 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone, on IL-1β-induced-mPGES-1 expression in human synovial fibroblasts and investigate the mechanisms underlying this regulation. Materials—Human recombinant IL-1β was obtained from R&D Systems Inc. 15d-PGJ2, troglitazone (TRO), Wy14643, GW9226, and enzyme immunoassay reagents for PGE2 assays were purchased from Cayman Chemical. Aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), penicillin and streptomycin, fetal calf serum (FCS), and TRIzol reagent were supplied by Invitrogen. [32P]ATP was from Amersham Biosciences. Plasmid DNA was prepared using a kit from Qiagen. FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was from Roche Applied Science. The luciferase reporter assay system was from Promega. All other chemicals were purchased from either Fisher Scientific or Bio-Rad. Anti-mPGES-1 antibody was from Cayman Chemical, whereas anti-cPGES antibodies were from Cayman Chemical or Affinity BioReagents. Antibodies against Egr-1, PPARγ, and β-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse IgG coupled with horseradish peroxidase and polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG with horseradish peroxidase were from Pierce. Specimen Selection and Cell Culture—HSFs were isolated from synovial membranes obtained from osteoarthritic (OA) patients undergoing total knee joint replacement. All OA patients were evaluated by a certified rheumatologist and diagnosed on criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology Diagnostic Subcommittee for OA (29Altman R.D. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1991; 20: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, synovial fibroblasts were released by sequential enzymatic digestion with 1 mg/ml Pronase (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h, followed by a 6-h incubation with 2 mg/ml collagenase (Type IA, Sigma) at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in tissue culture flasks (Primaria 3824, Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) allowing the adherence of non-fibroblastic cells possibly present in the cell preparation. In addition, flow cytometric analysis (Epic II, Coulter, Miami, FL) using the anti-CD14 (fluorescein isothiocyanate) antibody confirmed that no monocyte/macrophages were present in the synovial fibroblast preparation. The cells were seeded in tissue culture flasks and cultured until confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. Only cells between passages 3 and 7 were used. PGE2 Assays—At the end of the incubation period, the culture medium was collected and stored at –80 °C. Levels of PGE2 were determined using a PGE2 enzyme immunoassay kit from Cayman Chemical. The detection limit and sensitivity was 9 pg/ml. All assays were performed in duplicate. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), and 1 mm NaF). Lysates were sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). 20 μg of total cell lysate or nuclear extracts was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies and washed with wash buffer (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, with 0.1% Tween 20). The blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce), washed again, incubated with SuperSignal Ultra Chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce), and finally exposed to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Ltd., Rochester, NY). RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was isolated from HSFs using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and dissolved in 20 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O. 1 μg of total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase and reverse-transcribed using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase (Fermentas, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) as detailed in the manufacturer's guidelines. One-fiftieth of the reverse transcriptase reaction was analyzed by real-time PCR as described below. The following primers were used: mPGES-1, sense 5′-GAAGAAGGCCTTTGCCAAC-3′ and antisense 5′-GGAAGACCAGGAAGTGCATC-3′; cPGES, sense 5′-GCAAAGTGGTACGATCGAAGG-3′ and antisense 5′-TGTCCGTTCTTTTATGCTTGG-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, sense 5′-CAGAACATCATCCCTGCCTCT-3′ and antisense 5′-GCTTGACAAAGTGGTCGTTGAG-3′. Real-time Quantitative PCR—Quantitative PCR analysis was performed in a total volume of 50 μl containing cDNA template, 200 nm of sense and antisense primers, and 25 μl of SYBR® Green master mix (Qiagen). Incorporation of SYBR® Green dye into PCR products was monitored in real time using a Gene Amp 5700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) allowing determination of the threshold cycle (CT) at which exponential amplification of PCR products begins. After incubation at 95 °C for 10 min to activate the AmpliTaq Gold enzyme, the mixtures were subjected to 40 amplification cycles (15 s at 95 °C for denaturation and 1 min for annealing and extension at 60 °C). After PCR, dissociation curves were generated with one peak, indicating the specificity of the amplification. A threshold cycle (CT value) was obtained from each amplification curve using the software provided by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). Data were expressed as -fold changes relative to control conditions (unstimulated cells) using the ΔΔCT method as detailed in the manufacturer's guidelines (Applied Biosystems). A ΔCT value was first calculated by subtracting the CT value for the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the CT value for each sample. A ΔΔCT value was then calculated by subtracting the ΔCT value of the control from the ΔCT value of each treatment. The -fold changes compared with the control (unstimulated cells) were then determined by raising 2 to the ΔΔCT power. Each PCR reaction generated only the expected specific amplicon as shown by the melting-temperature profiles of the final product and by gel electrophoresis of test PCR reactions. Each PCR was performed in triplicate on two separate occasions from at least three independent experiments.

A β-galactosidase reporter vector under the control of SV40 promoter (pSV40-β-galactosidase) was from Promega. Transient transfection experiments were performed using FuGENE 6(1 μg of DNA:4 μl of FuGENE 6) (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Briefly, HSFs were seeded and grown to 50–60% confluence. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of the reporter construct and 0.5 μg of the internal control pSV40-β-galactosidase. In cotransfection experiments the amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by using a corresponding empty vector. Six hours later, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 1% FCS. The next day, the cells were treated for another 14 h with or without IL-1β in the absence or presence of 15d-PGJ2 or TRO. After harvesting, luciferase activity was determined and normalized to β-galactosidase activity (27Fahmi H. Di Battista J.A. Pelletier J.P. Mineau F. Ranger P. Martel-Pelletier J. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 595-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (28Fahmi H. Pelletier J.P. Di Battista J.A. Cheung H.S. Fernandes J. Martel-Pelletier J. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2002; 10: 100-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, HSFs were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and gently scrapped in ice-cold hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. The cells were allowed to swell on ice, and the nuclei were recovered by brief centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in high salt buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, followed by incubation on ice for 20 min. The nuclear extracts were recovered by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). A synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide, corresponding to the Egr-1 motifs in the human mPGES-1 promoter (5′-GTGGGGCGGGGCGTGGGCGGTGCT-3′), was end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The mutant competitor oligonucleotide had the following sequence with a 4-bp substitution (underlined): 5′-GTGGTTCGGGGCGTGTTCGGTGCT-3′. The binding buffer consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, and 2.5 μg of poly-(dI-dC). Binding reactions were conducted with 5 μg of nuclear extract and 100,000 cpm 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe at 22 °C for 20 min in a final volume of 10 μl. In supershift assays, the antibody to Egr-1 (1 μg/reaction) was incubated with the reaction mixture for 1 h at 4 °C before the addition of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. In cold competition assays, 100-fold molar excess of cold wild-type or mutant oligonucleotide was used. Binding complexes were resolved on non-denaturating 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a Tris borate buffer system, after which the gels were fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Statistical Analysis—All results were calculated as the mean ± S.E. of independent experiments. Statistics were analyzed using Student's 2-tailed t test. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Effect of PPAR Ligands on IL-1β-induced PGE2 Production and mPGES-1 Protein Expression in HSF—We initially examined the effect of three distinct classes of PPAR ligands on IL-1β-induced PGE2 production in HSF: 15d-PGJ2 and TRO, natural and synthetic PPARγ activators, respectively, and Wy14643, a selective PPARα activator. Quiescent HSF were stimulated with IL-1β (100 pg/ml) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of 15d-PGJ2 (5, 10, and 20 μm), TRO, or Wy14643 (10, 25, and 50 μm), and PGE2 production was determined. Under control cell culture conditions, HSFs released low levels of PGE2, and stimulation with IL-1β led to severalfold increase in PGE2 production (Fig. 1). Pretreatment with increasing concentrations of the PPARγ ligands 15d-PGJ2 or TRO suppressed IL-1β-induced PGE2 production in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, the selective PPARα activator had no effect on IL-1β-induced PGE2 production (Fig. 1). To determine whether these changes in PGE2 release were related to differences in amounts of mPGES-1, Western blotting of cell lysate protein was carried out. As expected, treatment with IL-1β resulted in a strong induction of mPGES-1 protein expression (16 kDa) (Fig. 2, A–C). Interestingly, both PPARγ ligands, 15d-PGJ2 and TRO, suppressed IL-1β-induced mPGES-1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). By contrast, the PPARα-specific activator, Wy14643, had no effect on IL-1β-induced mPGES-1 expression (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2 (lower panels), cPGES protein was constitutively expressed in HSFs, and its expression was not significantly altered by these treatments. These results indicate that PPARγ ligands can inhibit IL-1β-induced mPGES-1 expression. The concentrations of 15d-PGJ2 and TRO that inhibited IL-1β-induced mPGES-1 expression and PGE2 production had no effect on cell viability as determined by Trypan blue exclusion and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays (data not shown). Activation of PPARγ Inhibits IL-1β-induced mPGES-1 Expression at the Transcriptional Level—To further elucidate the mechanism responsible for the changes in amounts of mPGES-1 protein, we measured the steady-state level of mPGES-1 mRNA by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Treatment with IL-1β (100 pg/ml) enhanced the expression of mPGES-1 mRNA (Fig. 3A). Both 15d-PGJ2 and TRO dose-dependently suppressed IL-1β-induced mPGES-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3A). In contrast, and in agreement with the data in Fig. 2C, the PPARα-specific ligand Wy14643 had no significant effect on IL-1β-induced mPGES-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3A). As expected, the level of cPGES mRNA was not altered as a consequence of treatment with IL-1β alone or in combination with either PPARγ ligands (Fig. 3B). Thus, the level of mPGES-1 and cPGES mRNA expression mirrors the pattern of their respective protein expression. To determine whether the regulation of IL-1β-induced mPGES-1 mRNA by 15d-PGJ2 and TRO occurred at the level of transcription, we carried out transient transfection studies. Synovial fibroblasts were transfected with a human mPGES-1 promoter (–538 to –28) region/luciferase reporter gene construct and stimulated with IL-1β in the absen"

However, the mechanisms by which 15dPGJ2 mediates its therapeutic effects in vivo are unclear. We demonstrate that 15dPGJ2 at micromolar (2.5–10 μm) concentrations induces the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an anti-inflammatory enzyme, at both mRNA and protein levels in human lymphocytes. In contrast, troglitazone and ciglitazone, two thiazolidinediones that mimic several effects of 15dPGJ2 through their binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, did not affect HO-1 expression, and the positive effect of 15dPGJ2 on this process was mimicked instead by other cyclopentenone prostaglandins (PG), such as PGD2 (the precursor of 15dPGJ2) and PGA1 and PGA2 which do not interact with PPAR-γ. Also, 15dPGJ2 enhanced the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased xanthine oxidase activity in vitro. Inhibition of intracellular ROS production by N-acetylcysteine, TEMPO, Me2SO, 1,10-phenanthroline, or allopurinol resulted in a decreased 15dPGJ2-dependent HO-1 expression in the cells. Furthermore, buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of reduced glutathione synthesis, or Fe2+/Cu2+ ions enhanced the positive effect of 15dPGJ2 on HO-1 expression. On the other hand, the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, or the blockade of transcription factor NF-κB activation, hindered 15dPGJ2-elicited HO-1 expression. Collectively, the present data suggest that 15dPGJ2 anti-inflammatory actions at pharmacological concentrations involve the induction of HO-1 gene expression through mechanisms independent of PPAR-γ activation and dependent on ROS produced via the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system and/or through Fenton reactions. Both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways also appear implicated in modulation of HO-1 expression by 15dPGJ2. 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15dPGJ2 has been recently proposed as a potent anti-inflammatory agent.

In this context, 15dPGJ2 has been shown to inhibit the expression of inducible NO synthase, as well as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β production in mouse and human macrophages, thus suggesting a role for 15dPGJ2 in the inhibition of inflammation (16Ricote M.

Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Available data also suggest that the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression elicited by Δ12-PGJ2 in rat basophilic leukemia cells and other cell types involved in the inflammatory response may play an important role in the fate of heme liberated during inflammation, and thus an anti-inflammatory role has been ascribed to Δ12-PGJ2 (18Koizumi T. Odani N. Okuyama T. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21779-21784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this view, 15dPGJ2 has been suggested to play a feedback regulatory role in the resolution phase of inflammation and hence is considered as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases (1Straus D.S. Glass C.K. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 185-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). However, caution must be taken in assigning a solely anti-inflammatory role to 15dPGJ2, because there is also experimental evidence that 15dPGJ2 can induce the synthesis of the type II-secreted proinflammatory mediators phospholipase A (6Kliewer S.A.

Smith R.S. Phipps R.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1372-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that in stimulated human T lymphocytes, 15dPGJ2 induces a significant increase in interleukin-8 production through the activation of a MAP kinase- and NF-κB-dependent signaling pathway.Heme oxygenase is a widely distributed enzyme in mammalian tissues whose main function is associated with the degradation of heme to biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide (23Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M. Kutty R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 411-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three distinct isoforms of this protein have been characterized, two of which (HO-2 and HO-3) are constitutively expressed, whereas the third (HO-1) displays inducible expression (24McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Several pathological states, including hypoxia, atherosclerosis, and inflammation, have been found to be accompanied by overexpression of the HO-1 gene and increased HO-1 enzyme activity (25Motterlini R.

Physiol. 2000; 279: L1029-L1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have revealed the important function of HO-1 as a cytoprotective mechanism against oxidative insults, derived from the antioxidant activities of biliverdin and bilirubin and from the anti-inflammatory action of carbon monoxide. In this context, a common denominator characterizing the prompt stimulation of HO-1 expression occurring under the above conditions is a drastic change in the intracellular redox status accompanied by a transient decrease in cytosolic reduced glutathione levels (25Motterlini R.

Also, it has been shown that 15dPGJ2 is able to induce apoptosis in mouse T cells and to inhibit T cell activation (7Harris S.G. Phipps R.P. Eur. J.

However, the effect of 15dPGJ2 on HO-1 gene expression has not yet been analyzed in human lymphocytes, and in general there is no information available on the signaling mechanisms modulating HO-1 synthesis in these cells. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of 15dPGJ2, using pharmacological concentrations, on the expression of HO-1 in human lymphocytes, and the involvement of ROS-dependent specific pathways in this process. We present clear evidence that 15dPGJ2 at micromolar (2.5–10 μm) levels induces an increase of HO-1 mRNA and protein levels in human lymphocytes, a process that is prevented by scavengers of ROS, and we postulate that ROS derived from both Fenton chemistry and the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system are implicated in the induction of HO-1 gene expression in this cell type. In addition, we provide evidence of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and p38 MAP kinase acting as mediators of 15dPGJ2 effects on HO-1 expression and of the involvement of the transcription factor NF-κBin this process. These results contribute to shed some light on the mechanisms whereby 15dPGJ2 modulates leukocyte functions through PPAR-γ-independent pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—15dPGJ2, SN50 (AAVALLPAVLLALLAPVQRKRQKLMP), and SN50M (AAVALLPAVLLALLAPVQRNGQKLMP) peptides were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA).

To ensure that equal amounts of cDNA were added to the PCRs, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was amplified as a control, using the following primers: forward, 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′. PCR-amplified bands (HO-1, 365 bp; GADPH, 600 bp) were visualized on 1% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide using the BioDoc-It™ system (Ultraviolet Products, Upland, CA).ROS Production Assay—2,7-Dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA, from Sigma) was used as an indicator of the amount of intracellular ROS (41Cathcart R. Schwiers E. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar).

In addition, luminol- and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assays were performed as described (42El Bekay R. Alvarez M. Monteseirin J. Alba G. Chacon P. Vega A. Martin-Nieto J. Jimenez J.

Assays were performed using different concentrations of cow milk xanthine oxidase (Roche Diagnostics) in a reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 0.1 mm xanthine and 0.1 mm EDTA in 50 mm phosphate potassium buffer (pH 7.4). The reactions were carried out at 37 °C and stopped at 20 min by the addition of 100 μl of 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the uric acid produced was measured in the supernatants on the basis of the change in the absorbance at 293 nm.RESULTS15dPGJ2 Induces HO-1 Gene Expression in Human Lymphocytes—Preliminary experiments were addressed to analyze the effect of 15dPGJ2 on the expression of HO-1 in human lymphocytes. Fig. 1A shows that 10 μm 15dPGJ2 elicited the synthesis of HO-1 protein in a time-dependent manner. This effect was noticeable at 3 h after 15dPGJ2 addition, reaching its maximal expression at 12 h of treatment and maintaining at this level during the rest of the experiment (up to 30 h). The induction of HO-1 protein expression correlated with increased levels of HO-1 mRNA, which became detectable as early as 1 h after treatment with 15dPGJ2 (Fig. 1B). A dose-dependent analysis showed that HO-1 gene expression was induced at both protein (Fig. 1C) and mRNA (Fig. 1D) levels by concentrations of 15dPGJ2 in the 2.5–10 μm range. In order to study the molecular mechanisms implicated in 15dPGJ2-dependent HO-1 induction, human lymphocytes were treated with actinomycin D, a well known inhibitor of transcription, and cycloheximide, an established inhibitor of protein synthesis, before the addition of 15dPGJ2 (Fig. 1, E and F). As expected, the pretreatment of lymphocytes with actinomycin D blocked both HO-1 protein and mRNA synthesis, whereas cycloheximide inhibited HO-1 protein expression but did not affect mRNA expression, suggesting th"

Although the exact roles of polyamines in apoptotic pathway are still unclear, inhibition of polyamine synthesis promotes the resistance of intestinal epithelial cells to apoptosis. Akt is a serine-threonine kinase that has been established as an important intracellular signaling in regulating cell survival. The current studies test the hypothesis that polyamines are involved in the control of Akt activity in normal intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6 line) and that activated Akt mediates suppression of apoptosis following polyamine depletion. Depletion of cellular polyamines by α-difluoromethylornithine induced levels of phosphorylated Akt and increased Akt kinase activity, although it had no effect on expression of total Akt, pERK, p38, and Bcl-2 proteins. This activated Akt was associated with both decreased levels of active caspase-3 and increased resistance to tumor necrosis factor-α/cycloheximide-induced apoptosis. Inactivation of Akt by either treatment with LY294002 or ectopic expression of a dominant negative Akt mutant (DNMAkt) not only enhanced the caspase-3 activation in polyamine-deficient cells but also prevented the increased resistance to tumor necrosis factor-α/cycloheximide-induced apoptosis. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3, a downstream target of Akt, was also increased in α-difluoromethylornithine-treated cells, which was prevented by inactivation of Akt by LY294002 or DNMAkt overexpression.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3569-3577PubMed Google Scholar). To maintain tissue homeostasis of the mucosa, the rates of epithelial cell division and apoptosis must be highly regulated. Increasing evidence indicates that the natural polyamines spermidine and spermine and their precursor, putrescine, are the central convergence point for the multiple signaling pathways driving different epithelial cell functions.

Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G795-G806PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that normal intestinal epithelial growth depends on the supply of polyamines to the dividing cells in the crypts, and that differentiated epithelial cells of the mucosal surface are also exposed to the high concentrations of polyamines in the luminal contents of the intestine (13Osborne D.L. Seidel E.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: G576-G584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, polyamines have been implicated in the control of the apoptotic response in intestinal epithelial cells (14Ha H.C. Woster P.M. Yager J.D. Casero R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11557-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 15Lindsay G.S. Wallace H.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Poulin R. Pelletier G. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms by which polyamines are involved in the regulation of apoptosis are still unclear. The serine-threonine kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B (PKB), 1The abbreviations used are: PKB, protein kinase B; DFMO, difluoromethylornithine; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; CHX, cycloheximide; IEC, intestinal epithelial cells; FBS, fetal bovine serum; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; DFFI, DNA fragmentation factor inhibitor; GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; MOPS, 4-mor-pholinepropanesulfonic acid; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. is the cellular homologue of the retroviral oncogene v-Akt and has been established as a multifunctional signaling intermediate in the regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and energy metabolism (17Brazil D.P.

Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). To date, there are three mammalian isoforms of Akt proteins: Akt1 (PKBα), Akt2 (PKBβ), and Akt3 (PKBγ), which display more than 80% sequence homology (19Jones P.F. Jakubowicz T. Pitossi F.J. Maurer F. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). All three isoforms of Akt contain a pleckstrin homology domain at the N terminus, followed by a catalytic domain related to PKA and PKC, and a regulatory region at the C terminus. The catalytic domain of Akt contains the first phosphorylation site, Thr308, and the second phosphorylation site, Ser473, is located in the C-terminal tail (20Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1990; 15: 6541-6551Crossref Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of both Thr308 and Ser473 is required for full enzyme activity of Akt (18Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Recently, an exciting insight into the function of Akt is its involvement in the regulation of apoptosis. Akt has been shown to positively mediate cell survival in skeletal muscle (22Fujio Y. Guo K.

Akt activation is induced by several growth factors including nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1, which results in receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation (21Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). Activated Akt phosphorylates several downstream targets, including Bad, caspase-9, and forkhead transcription factor FKHR, thus altering their proapoptotic or antiapoptotic functions (28Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E.

In addition, many other members of the apoptotic machinery as well as transcription factors contain the Akt consensus phosphorylation site (17Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 18Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), further suggesting that Akt play a crucial role in cell survival. Although the exact roles of polyamines in apoptotic pathways has been rather controversial, depending on the cell type and death stimulus, we (10Li L. Li J. Rao J.N. Li M.L. Bass B.L. Wang J.-Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C946-C954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Li L. Rao J.N. Bass B.L. Wang J.-Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G992-G1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that polyamine depletion by inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase, the first rate-limiting step in polyamine synthesis, with difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) promotes the resistance to TNF-α/cycloheximide (CHX)-induced apoptosis in normal intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6 line). Given the distinct roles of cellular polyamines in regulation of intestinal epithelial functions and that Akt signaling is a key control point of cell survival, the current studies were to test the hypothesis that polyamines are involved in the control of Akt activity in intestinal epithelial cells and the activated Akt mediates the increased resistance to TNF-α/CHX-induced apoptosis following polyamine depletion. First, we examined whether polyamine depletion induced Akt phosphorylation and increased its kinase activity in IEC-6 cells. Second, we determined whether inactivation of Akt by either treatment with the specific chemical inhibitor LY294002 or ectopic expression of the dominant negative Akt mutant prevented the increased resistance of polyamine-deficient cells to TNF-α/CHX-induced apoptosis. Third, we tested the possibility that activated Akt induced intestinal epithelial cell survival by inhibiting caspase-3 activity following polyamine depletion. Some of these data have been published previously in abstract form (32Zhang H.M. Rao J.N. Guo X. Liu L. Zou T.T. Turner D.L. Wang J.-Y. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 103589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Chemicals and Supplies—Disposable culture ware was purchased from Corning Glass Works (Corning, NY). Tissue culture media and dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Invitrogen, and biochemicals were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies against phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt at serine 473), total Akt, phosphorylated extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (pERK), and phosphorylated-p38 (pp38 at Thr180/Tyr182) were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). dl-α-DFMO was purchased from Ilex Oncology Inc. (San Antonio, TX). LY294002 and the non-radioactive Akt kinase assay kit were purchased from Cell Signaling. Plasmid Construction and Transfection—The full-length cDNA of the dominant negative Akt mutant (DNMAkt), containing a Myc-His tag at its 3′ end and a substitution of methionine (ATG) for lysine (AAG) at residue 179 (33Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; : 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), was inserted into the Klenow-blunted NheI and PmeI sites of expression vector pUSEamp(+) (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA) with the cytomegalovirus promoter. The IEC-6 cells were transfected with the pUSEampDNMAkt or pUSEamp(+) vectors containing no DNMAkt cDNA by using the LipofectAMINE kit and performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). After the 3-h period of incubation, the transfection medium was replaced by the standard growth medium containing 5% FBS for 2 days before exposure to the selection medium. These transfected cells were selected for Akt integration by incubation with the selection medium containing 0.6 mg/ml G418, and clones resistant to the selection medium were isolated, cultured, and screened for DNMAkt expression by Western blot analysis using the specific anti-Myc antibody. Cell Cultures and General Experimental Protocols—The IEC-6 cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection at passage 13. The cell line was derived from normal rat intestinal crypt cells and was developed and characterized by Quaroni et al. (34Quaroni A. Wand S.J. Trelstad R.L. Isselbacher K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 248-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Stock cells were maintained in T-150 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 10 μg of insulin/ml, and 50 μg/ml of gentamicin. Flasks were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 90% air, 10% CO2 and passages 15-20 were used in experiments. There were no significant changes of biological function and characterization of IEC-6 cells at passages 15-20 (35Liu L. Santora R. Rao J.N. Guo X. Zou T. Zhang H.M. Turner D.J. Wang J.-Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G1056-G1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 36Wang J.-Y. McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Wang H.L. Tzen C.Y. Scott R.E. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G331-G338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the first series of studies, we examined whether polyamine depletion increased Akt phosphorylation and its kinase activity in IEC-6 cells. The general protocol of the experiments and methods were similar to those described previously (10Li L. Li J. Rao J.N. Li M.L. Bass B.L. Wang J.-Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C946-C954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Li L. Rao J.N. Bass B.L. Wang J.-Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G992-G1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, IEC-6 cells were plated at 6.25 × 104 cells/cm2 and grown in control medium (DMEM + 5% dialyzed FBS + 10 μg of insulin and 50 μg of gentamicin sulfate/ml) or the DMEM containing 5 mm DFMO or DFMO plus 10 μm putrescine for 2, 4, and 6 days. The dishes were placed on ice, the monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and then different solutions were added according to the assays to be conducted. Levels of p-Akt, total Akt, pERK, pp38, and Bcl-2 proteins were measured by Western blot analysis and activity of the Akt kinase was examined by using non-radioactive Akt kinase assay kit. In the second series of studies, we investigated whether induced Akt activity played a role in the increased resistance of polyamine-deficient cells to TNF-α/CHX-induced apoptosis. Akt activation in polyamine-deficient cells was specifically prevented by either pretreatment with the chemical inhibitor LY294002 or stable DNMAkt transfection. IEC-6 cells were grown in the presence of DFMO for 6 days and LY294002 at a concentration of 20 μm was added to the medium during the last 24 h. Apoptosis was induced by exposure to TNF-α in combination with CHX. In studies dealing with DNMAkt, stable DNMAkt-transfected IEC cells were treated with 5 mm DFMO for 6 days and then exposed to TNF-α/CHX. Apoptotic cell death was examined 4 h after treatment with TNF-α/CHX. In the third series of studies, we examined the involvement of caspase-3 activity in the mechanism by which activated Akt mediates suppression of TNF-α/CHX-induced apoptosis in polyamine-deficient cells. IEC-6 cells were initially grown in cultures containing 5 mm DFMO for 5 days, treated with 20 μm LY294002 for 24 h in the presence of DFMO, and then exposed to TNF-α/CHX. Stable DNMAkt-transfected IEC cells were grown in the presence of 5 mm DFMO for 6 days and then treated with TNF-α/CHX for 4 h. Levels of the active form caspase-3, its downstream proteins poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and DFFI were measured 4 h after exposure to TNF-α/CHX. Western Blot Analysis—Cell samples, dissolved in ice-cold MOPS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 205 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mg/ml aprotinin), were sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by the methods described by Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), and each lane was loaded with 20 μg of protein equivalent. The supernatant was boiled for 5 min and then subjected to electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels according to Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1990; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Immunologic evaluation was then performed overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat dry milk/Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 buffer containing specific antibodies against p-Akt, total Akt, pp38, pERK, Bcl-2, caspase-3, PARP, DFFI, pGSK-3, pFKHR, and pBad proteins. The filters were subsequently washed with 1× Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 and incubated with the secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. The immunocomplexes on the filters were reacted for 1 min with chemiluminescence reagent (NEL-100 PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Measurement of Akt Kinase Activity—Akt kinase activity was examined by using the non-radioactive Akt kinase kit (Cell Signaling) and performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, whole cell lysates from control and polyamine-deficient cells were collected and incubated with anti-Akt antibody at 4 °C for 3 h for immunoprecipitation. The pellets were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer and twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer. Exogenous glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), a downstream target of phosphorylated Akt, served as the substrate of p-Akt in this assay. The kinase reaction was carried in a 40-μl kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of GSK-3 fusion protein at 30 °C for 30 min and the reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of SDS buffer. Akt kinase activity was determined by Western blotting analysis using anti-pGSK-3α/β antibody. Assessment of Morphology and Annexin V Staining—After various experimental treatments, cells were photographed with a Nikon inverted microscope before fixation. Annexin V staining of apoptosis was carried out using a commercial apoptosis kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and performed according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were rinsed with 1× binding buffer, and resuspended in 200 μl of 1× binding buffer. Five μl of annexin V was added on the slide and incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the dark. Annexin-stained cells were visualized and photographed under a fluorescence microscope using a dual filter set for fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine, and the percentage of “apoptotic” cells was determined. High Performance Liquid Chromatography Analysis of Cellular Polyamines—The cellular polyamine content was determined as previously described (10Li L. Li J. Rao J.N. Li M.L. Bass B.L. Wang J.-Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C946-C954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wang J.-Y. McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Wang H.L. Tzen C.Y. Scott R.E. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G331-G338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results are expressed as nanomoles of polyamines per milligram of protein. Statistics—Values are mean ± S.E. from three to six samples. Autoradiographic results were repeated three times. The significance of the difference between means was determined by analysis of variance. The level of significance was determined using Duncan's multiple-range test (39Harter J.L. Biometrics. 1960; : 671-685Crossref Google Scholar). Effect of Polyamine Depletion on Akt Phosphorylation and Its Kinase Activity in IEC-6 Cells—Our previous studies (31Li L. Rao J.N. Bass B.L. Wang J.-Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G992-G1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Zou T.T. Rao J.N. Guo X. Lan L. Zhang H.M. Strauch E.D. Bass B.L. Wang J.-Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1109-C1118Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) demonstrated that polyamines regulate susceptibility of intestinal epithelial cells to apoptosis and that depletion of cellular polyamines promotes resistance to TNF-α/CHX-induced apoptosis. The focus of the current study went further to determine the involvement of the Akt signaling pathway in this process. Consistent with our previous studies (10Li L. Li J. Rao J.N. Li M.L. Bass B.L. Wang J.-Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C946-C954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wang J.-Y. McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Wang H.L. Tzen C.Y. Scott R.E. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G331-G338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase activity by exposure to 5 mm DFMO almost completely depleted cellular polyamines in IEC-6 cells. Putrescine was undetectable on day 2 after treatment with DFMO. Spermidine was significantly decreased on day 2 and was undetectable on day 4. Spermine was less sensitive to DFMO but decreased by ∼65% on days 4 and 6 in the DFMO-treated cells (data not shown). Results presented in Fig. 1 show that polyamine depletion by DFMO increased levels of Akt phosphorylation, although it had no effect on expression of total Akt, pERK, pp38, and Bcl-2 proteins. The induction of phosphorylated Akt protein (p-Akt) occurred at day 2 and continuously increased at 4 and 6 days after treatment with DFMO. The levels of p-Akt in DFMO-treated cells were ∼2.3, ∼6.2, and ∼8.6 times the normal values (without DFMO) at 2, 4, and 6 days, respectively (Fig. 1B). Putrescine (10 μm) given together with DFMO inhibited the increase in the levels of p-Akt protein. Addition of spermidine (5 μm) had an effect equal to putrescine on p-Akt when it was added to cultures containing DFMO (data not shown). In addition, although the levels of pERK gradually increased with times during cell growth, there were no significant differences between controls and cells treated with DFMO alone or DFMO plus putrescine. Increased levels of p-Akt in cells exposed to DFMO were paralleled by a significant increase in Akt kinase activity as indicated by increased phosphorylation of exogenous GSK-3 in an in vitro assay (Fig. 2A). The levels of Akt kinase activity were increased by ∼10-fold after 6 days of DFMO treatment, and this effect was completely prevented by putrescine given together with DFMO (Fig. 2B). These results clearly indicate that depletion of cellular polyamines increases Akt phosphorylation and activates its kinase activity in intestinal epithelial cells. Effect of Inhibition of Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K) by Treatment with LY294002 on Akt Phosphorylation in Polyamine-deficient Cells—To determine the involvement of PI3K signaling in Akt activation following polyamine depletion, a specific PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (41Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used in this study. As shown in Fig. 3A, exposure of polyamine-deficient cells to LY294002 dose-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt protein. When LY294002 at different concentrations was added to the medium for 24 h, levels of p-Akt protein in DFMO-treated cells were decreased by ∼59% at 10 μm, ∼81% at 20 μm, and ∼89% at 50 μm, respectively. This inhibitory effect of LY294002 on Akt phosphorylation in DFMO-treated cells is specific because levels of total Akt protein were not affected (Fig. 3A, a, middle). Results presented in Fig. 3B further show that treatment with LY294002 at concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 μm did not induce a significant formation of the active form caspase-3, although this compound at the concentration of 50 μm slightly induced the cleavage of procaspase-3 to caspase-3 in polyamine-deficient cells. In addition, there was no apparent loss of cell viability in DFMO-treated cells exposed to LY294002 at the concentration of 20 μm for 24 h (data not shown). These findings suggest that polyamine depletion induces activation of Akt through the PI3K-dependent pathway in intestinal epithelial cells. Effect of LY294002 on the Increased Resistance to TNF-α/CHX-induced Apoptosis following Polyamine Depletion—To elucidate the function of increased Akt activity in polyamine-deficient cells, the TNF-α/CHX-induced apoptosis model was used. TNF-α is a proinflammatory cytokine that has a potent cytotoxic effect on intestinal epithelial cells and is widely used as an apoptotic inducer (30Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S.

However, the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α on most cells, including intestinal epithelial cells, are only evident if protein synthesis is inhibited (30Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S.

https://openalex.org/W1985126895,"Phosphatidylcholine is a major component of very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) secreted by the liver. Hepatic phosphatidylcholine is synthesized from choline via the CDP-choline pathway and from the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase pathway. Elimination of the methyltransferase in male mice reduces hepatic VLDL secretion. Our objective was to determine whether inhibition of the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine synthesis (by restricting the supply of choline) also impaired VLDL secretion. In mice fed a choline-deficient (CD), compared with a choline-supplemented, diet for 21 days, the amounts of plasma apolipoproteins (apo) B100 and B48 were reduced and the liver triacylglycerol content was increased. Hepatocytes were isolated from male mice that had been fed the CD diet for 3 or 21 days, and the cells were incubated with or without choline. The secretion of apoB100 and B48 from CD hepatocytes was not reduced, and triacylglycerol secretion was only modestly decreased, compared with that from cells supplemented with choline. Remarkably, in light of widely held assumptions, the rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis from the CDP-choline pathway was not decreased in CD hepatocytes. Rather, there was a trend toward increased phosphatidylcholine synthesis that might be explained by enhanced CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity. Although the concentration of phosphocholine in CD hepatocytes was reduced, the size of the phosphocholine pool remained well above the K for the cytidylyltransferase. Moreover, the amount and m activity of the cytidylyltransferase and methyltransferase were increased. The reduction in plasma apoB in mice deprived of dietary choline cannot, therefore, be attributed to decreased apoB secretion. Phosphatidylcholine is a major component of very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) secreted by the liver. Hepatic phosphatidylcholine is synthesized from choline via the CDP-choline pathway and from the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase pathway. Elimination of the methyltransferase in male mice reduces hepatic VLDL secretion. Our objective was to determine whether inhibition of the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine synthesis (by restricting the supply of choline) also impaired VLDL secretion. In mice fed a choline-deficient (CD), compared with a choline-supplemented, diet for 21 days, the amounts of plasma apolipoproteins (apo) B100 and B48 were reduced and the liver triacylglycerol content was increased. Hepatocytes were isolated from male mice that had been fed the CD diet for 3 or 21 days, and the cells were incubated with or without choline. The secretion of apoB100 and B48 from CD hepatocytes was not reduced, and triacylglycerol secretion was only modestly decreased, compared with that from cells supplemented with choline. Remarkably, in light of widely held assumptions, the rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis from the CDP-choline pathway was not decreased in CD hepatocytes. Rather, there was a trend toward increased phosphatidylcholine synthesis that might be explained by enhanced CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2084665652,"The molecular chaperone Hsp33 in Escherichia coli responds to oxidative stress conditions with the rapid activation of its chaperone function. On its activation pathway, Hsp33 progresses through three major conformations, starting as a reduced, zinc-bound inactive monomer, proceeding through an oxidized zinc-free monomer, and ending as a fully active oxidized dimer. While it is known that Hsp33 senses oxidative stress through its C-terminal four-cysteine zinc center, the nature of the conformational changes in Hsp33 that must take place to accommodate this activation process is largely unknown. To investigate these conformational rearrangements, we constructed constitutively monomeric Hsp33 variants as well as fragments consisting of the redox regulatory C-terminal domain of Hsp33. These proteins were studied by a combination of biochemical and NMR spectroscopic techniques. We found that in the reduced, monomeric conformation, zinc binding stabilizes the C terminus of Hsp33 in a highly compact, α-helical structure. This appears to conceal both the substrate-binding site as well as the dimerization interface. Zinc release without formation of the two native disulfide bonds causes the partial unfolding of the C terminus of Hsp33. This is sufficient to unmask the substrate-binding site, but not the dimerization interface, rendering reduced zinc-free Hsp33 partially active yet monomeric. Critical for the dimerization is disulfide bond formation, which causes the further unfolding of the C terminus of Hsp3 and allows the association of two oxidized Hsp33 monomers. This then leads to the formation of active Hsp33 dimers, which are capable of protecting cells against the severe consequences of oxidative heat stress.

This then leads to the formation of active Hsp33 dimers, which are capable of protecting cells against the severe consequences of oxidative heat stress. The molecular chaperone Hsp33 belongs to a novel class of redox-regulated proteins, whose activity is regulated by their redox state (1Paget M.S. Buttner M.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, Hsp33 is located in the highly reducing environment of the cytosol, where it is monomeric and largely devoid of chaperone function. Upon exposure to oxidative stress in vitro or in vivo, Hsp33 is quickly activated as a potent molecular chaperone (2Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The switch that regulates the activity of Hsp33 is a novel, very high affinity zinc-binding motif (CXCX27-32CXXC) that is located in the C terminus of the protein (3Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38302-38310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The four absolutely conserved cysteines that constitute this redox switch are kept in the reduced deprotonated thiolate anion state and together coordinate one zinc(II) ion (KD ∼ 10-18 m) (3Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38302-38310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Under oxidative stress conditions, these four cysteines release zinc and rapidly form two intramolecular disulfide bonds, connecting the two pairs of neighboring cysteines, Cys232 with Cys234 and Cys265 with Cys268 (4Barbirz S. Jakob U. Glocker M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18759-18766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Disulfide bond formation and concomitant zinc release then induces the dimerization of two oxidized Hsp33 monomers (5Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Once activated, Hsp33 is a highly efficient chaperone holdase, which is able to prevent the aggregation of a variety of unfolded proteins. To prime Hsp33 for substrate protein release, reducing conditions have to be restored. This turns Hsp33 into a reduced dimer, which is still active but now able to transfer the substrate proteins to the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE foldase system for refolding once this system becomes available (6Hoffmann J.H. Linke K. Graf P.C.F. Lilie H. Jakob U. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies showed that Hsp33 senses reactive oxygen species through its C-terminal four-cysteine zinc center, with zinc playing an important role for the formation of the correct disulfide bonds and the rapid activation of the chaperone function of Hsp33 (3Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38302-38310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The precise structural changes that accompany disulfide bond formation and permit the dimerization of Hsp33 are, however, largely unknown. This is in part because no structural information exists for the redox-active C terminus of Hsp33. Both of the crystal structures that were solved were of N-terminal fragments, which ended just after the first pair of redox-active cysteines (7Vijayalakshmi J. Mukhergee M.K. Graumann J. Jakob U. Saper M.A. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 367-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Kim S.J. Jeong D.G. Chi S.W. Lee J.S. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Previously, Raman et al. (9Raman B. Siva Kumar L.V. Ramakrishna T. Mohan Rao C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) used circular dichroism to demonstrate that Hsp33 undergoes dramatic conformational changes upon oxidation. They also showed that Hsp33 exposes hydrophobic surfaces in the oxidized conformation, but not in the reduced, inactive state. Because most molecular chaperones interact with their substrate proteins through hydrophobic interactions, these exposed hydrophobic surfaces are likely to represent the substrate-binding site of Hsp33. Thus, it is conceivable that the substrate-binding site is masked in the reduced, inactive form but exposed in the oxidized, active form. At the time of these studies, however, neither the activation mechanism nor the fact that oxidized Hsp33 can form both monomers and dimers were known. We show here that the C-terminal zinc-binding domain is fully folded in the reduced zinc-coordinated Hsp33 conformation. This appears to mask both the dimerization interface and the substrate-binding site. Upon zinc release and disulfide bond formation, the C-terminal domain of Hsp33 dramatically unfolds. This exposes the substrate-binding site and unmasks the dimerization interface. NMR and CD studies of the isolated C-terminal domain and the full-length Hsp33 wild type protein suggested that only the C-terminal redox switch domain unfolds, while the structure of the N-terminal chaperone domain appears largely unaltered by the oxidation and dimerization process. Proteins—Wild type Hsp33 and the cysteine-free Hsp33 mutant protein were purified in the absence of reducing agents as described previously (2Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 5Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The Glu150 to Arg150 point mutation was introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using matching primers. The forward primer that was used read 5′-GATTACTTTATGCGTTCTAGACAGCTGCCGACGCGCC-3′. A pET11a vector containing wild type Hsp33 (pUJ30) was used as template (2Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of the region was sequenced. BL21 strains containing an insertion mutation in hslO, the gene encoding Hsp33 (hslO::Km) (JH13) were transformed with this plasmid (5Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and the mutant protein (Hsp33-E150R) was overexpressed and purified according to the purification protocol of wild type Hsp33 (2Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The coding sequences for each of the C-terminal domain fragments of Hsp33 were obtained using standard PCR methods and pUJ30 as template DNA. The sequences were re-cloned into a pET21a expression vector, and DNA sequencing was used to confirm the identity of the inserts. The plasmids were transformed into JH13 strains, and the Hsp33 fragments were purified under native conditions, using an anion exchange column (HiTrap Q-Sepharose) followed by a gel filtration column (Superdex 75 or Sephacryl S100 HR). Isotopically labeled NMR samples of the C-terminal constructs were prepared by growing the cells at 15 °C in M9 minimal medium (0.67% Na2HPO4, 0.3% KH2PO4, 0.05% NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2) containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and supplemental basal Eagle's medium vitamins. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the medium was supplemented with 15NH4Cl and [13C]glucose. At the time of induction, ZnSO4 was added to a final concentration of 150 μm. The labeled protein fragments were purified using the same protocol that was employed for the unlabeled proteins. The purity of the protein fragments was checked by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Firefly luciferase was obtained from Sigma. Pig heart mitochondrial citrate synthase (CS) 1The abbreviations used are: CS, citrate synthase; bis-ANS, 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine; aa, amino acid. was from Roche Applied Science and prepared as described (10Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). All protein concentrations are listed in the monomer concentration. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—The oxidized species of wild type Hsp33 and its variants were analyzed at initial protein concentrations of 0.02-0.6 mg/ml in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, with a Beckman Optima XL-A centrifuge equipped with an An50Ti rotor. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements (absorption at 230 and 280 nm) were carried out in double sector cells at 10,000 rpm, and 20 °C sedimentation velocity was analyzed at 40,000 rpm with scans taken every 10 min. Data were analyzed with the software provided by Beckman Instruments (Palo Alto, CA). Bis-ANS (4,4′-Dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid) Fluorescence—To probe for the presence of hydrophobic surfaces in Hsp33, the fluorescent probe bis-ANS (Molecular Probes) was used. Hsp33 (3 μm) and bis-ANS (10 μm) were mixed in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, and fluorescence emission spectra (Hitachi F4500) from 400-600 nm were recorded at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength was set to 370 nm, and the slit widths were set to 2.5 and 5 nm, respectively. The spectrum of bis-ANS in the absence of protein was used as buffer control. Chaperone Assays—The influence of the different Hsp33 preparations on the aggregation of chemically unfolded luciferase was determined as described previously with some minor modifications (5Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, luciferase was denatured in 4.5 m guanidine hydrochloride, 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, at room temperature. To initiate refolding, denatured luciferase was diluted 1:160 (final concentration: 48 nm) into 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, at 30 °C with or without 192 nm Hsp33. To analyze the influence of Hsp33 on the aggregation of thermally unfolding luciferase, native luciferase (final concentration: 0.1 μm) was incubated in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, at 43 °C in the absence or presence of 0.1 μm Hsp33. In both experiments, light scattering was measured using a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostated cell holder and stirrer. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 350 nm, and the slit widths were set to 2.5 nm. To analyze the influence of Hsp33 on thermally unfolding CS, native CS (final concentration: 0.15 μm) was diluted into 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, at 43 °C in the absence or presence of 0.3 μm Hsp33. Light scattering was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths set to 500 nm. The slit widths were set again to 2.5 nm. Oxidation-induced Zinc Release and Activation of Hsp33—The oxidation-induced release of zinc from Hsp33 by H2O2 incubation was performed as described previously (5Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 50 μm reduced, zinc-replete wild type Hsp33 or Hsp33-E150R mutant protein was incubated with 2 mm H2O2 in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, at 43 °C. At various time points, aliquots were taken to determine the extent of zinc release as well as the extent of chaperone activity using thermally unfolding citrate synthase as a substrate protein. Circular Dichroism and NMR Spectroscopy—To prepare reduced, zinc-reconstituted wild type Hsp33, Hsp33-E150R and Hsp33-218-287 aa fragments for CD measurements, 200 μm Hsp33 were incubated in 5 mm DTT and equimolar concentration of ZnCl2 for 30 min at 37 °C. To prepare reduced, metal-free Hsp33-218-287 aa fragment, 200 μm Hsp33-218-287 aa fragment was incubated in 5 mm DTT and 5 mm TPEN (N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridyl-methyl)ethylenediamine) at 43 °C for 30 min. Then, NAP-5 columns (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm DTT were used for desalting and buffer exchange according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Oxidation of the zinc-reconstituted fragment (36 μm) was achieved with 2 mm H2O2 at 37 °C for 30 min. Oxidized wild type Hsp33 and Hsp33-E150R were prepared by incubating 200 or 5 μm reduced, zinc-replete Hsp33 with 2 mm H2O2 at 43 °C for 4 or 1 h, respectively. The oxidized samples were then dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. Far-UV CD spectra were measured on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter in a quartz cell with 1-mm path length at 25 °C. All spectra were first buffer-corrected and then normalized for slight variations in Hsp33 concentration. For NMR, the Hsp33 proteins were oxidized by using a mixed redox buffer of reduced and oxidized glutathione (11Mo H. Moore R.C. Cohen F.E. Westaway D. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2352-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The buffer contained 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm GSSG, 0.5 mm GSH, and 100 mm EDTA, with a protein concentration of ∼0.1 mg/ml. NMR spectra were obtained on Bruker spectrometers operating at 500 and 600 MHz. The Four Hsp33 Conformations—The activation mechanism of Hsp33 is at least a two-step process (5Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the first step, reduced zinc-coordinated Hsp33 undergoes oxidation-induced disulfide bond formation and releases its bound zinc. This causes the formation of zinc-free oxidized monomeric Hsp33 intermediates. In a second step, two oxidized Hsp33 monomers dimerize to form the fully active molecular chaperone. To dissect the roles of zinc binding and disulfide bond formation in the activation process of Hsp33, and to analyze and compare the functional and conformational changes that accompany this process, we required at least four different stable conformations of Hsp33: 1) reduced, zinc-coordinated monomeric Hsp33, 2) reduced, zinc-free monomeric Hsp33, 3) oxidized monomeric Hsp33, and 4) oxidized dimeric Hsp33. Both reduced, zinc-coordinated Hsp33 monomers as well as oxidized Hsp33 dimers are stable, easy to prepare, and have been characterized in detail before (2Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 5Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To create a stably reduced, metal-free Hsp33 variant, we decided to use a mutant of Hsp33, in which all cysteine residues had been replaced (Cys-free Hsp33) (5Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This mutant protein should allow us to specifically analyze the role of zinc coordination on the activity and conformation of monomeric Hsp33 without the potential interference of disulfide bond formation. To generate oxidized monomeric Hsp33, which is presumably an intermediate in the activation pathway of Hsp33, and therefore only transiently present, we decided to introduce mutations into the highly conserved dimerization interface in an attempt to disrupt intersubunit contacts. Three residues, Ser149, Glu150, and Gln151 are located precisely at the dimerization interface and are highly conserved (7Vijayalakshmi J. Mukhergee M.K. Graumann J. Jakob U. Saper M.A. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 367-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Ser149 and Gln151 are absolutely conserved residues found in every Hsp33 homologue identified so far, while Glu150 has been found in all but two Hsp33 homo-logues, where it is substituted with a glutamine residue. Both Glu150 and Gln151 make numerous stabilizing contacts between the two subunits. For instance, hydrogen bonds exist between the Glu150 carboxylate oxygen of one subunit and the backbone amide of Gln151 as well as the carboxylate group of Glu150 of the other subunit (7Vijayalakshmi J. Mukhergee M.K. Graumann J. Jakob U. Saper M.A. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 367-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our rationale was now that the mutation of these central residues should specifically impair dimerization without changing the overall fold or redox activity of Hsp33. This should allow us then to create Hsp33 variants that can form disulfide bonds but remain monomeric both in vitro and in vivo. In one mutant protein, we substituted the central Glu150 with the bulky, positively charged arginine residue, creating the Hsp33-E150R mutant protein. In another Hsp33 mutant, we substituted both central amino acids Glu150 and Gln151 with alanine residues, creating the Hsp33-E150A-Q151A mutant protein. Because both mutant proteins behaved nearly identically both in vitro and in vivo, we will focus here only on the results obtained with the Hsp33-E150R mutant protein. Generation of Redox-active, Constitutively Monomeric Hsp33 Species—The Hsp33-E150R mutant was first overexpressed and purified to homogeneity. The purification protocol of wild type Hsp33 was applied to purify this mutant protein, and Hsp33-E150R was found to behave identically to the wild type Hsp33 protein. The purified Hsp33-E150R mutant protein was then completely reduced and incubated with excess zinc. As is the case with wild type protein, once unbound zinc and excess DTT were separated from the protein, a 1:1 molar ratio of zinc to protein was determined (Fig. 1). In wild type Hsp33, disulfide bond formation induces the release of bound zinc (5Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, kinetic analysis of the oxidation-induced zinc release provides a convenient method to monitor the kinetics of disulfide bond formation in response to H2O2 (5Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the apparent t1/2 of oxidation-induced zinc release is about 16 min for both wild type Hsp33 and the Hsp33-E150R mutant (Fig. 1, closed and open circles). Ellman's assays to determine the extent of disulfide bond formation in both wild type Hsp33 and the mutant confirmed the formation of two disulfide bonds in both proteins (data not shown). This showed that the introduction of a large, positively charged amino acid into a highly conserved region of Hsp33 did not alter the H2O2 sensitivity of Hsp33. To determine the oligomerization status of the oxidized Hsp33-E150R mutant protein, oxidized Hsp33-E150R was subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation. As shown previously, oxidized Hsp33 dimers sedimented at 2.8 S, while reduced Hsp33 monomers and the constitutively monomeric Cys-free Hsp33 mutant sedimented at 2.1 and 1.9 S, respectively (5Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, inset). In excellent agreement with our structural predictions, the oxidized Hsp33-E150R mutant protein behaved very similarly to our monomeric Hsp33 preparations and sedimented with 2.1 S (Fig. 1, inset). To determine the KD for dimerization of the Hsp33-E150R mutant protein, sedimentation analysis was performed using various concentrations of the oxidized Hsp33-E150R mutant protein. At the highest protein concentrations (∼1 mg/ml) that can be used in these measurements, we were unable to detect any significant dimerization. We concluded that the KD of the Hsp33-E150R in the absence of substrate proteins must be at least 2 orders of magnitude greater than the KD of oxidized wild type Hsp33, which was determined to be 0.59 μm at 20 °C (5Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The monomeric state was also confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium experiments, in which a molecular mass of 33,160 ± 2,060 Da was observed independent of the protein concentration. These results showed that the substitution of the highly conserved Glu150 to Arg resulted indeed in a redox-regulated, constitutively monomeric Hsp33 variant. This mutant protein, therefore, should represent the stable oxidized monomeric Hsp33 species, which is presumably only transiently present during the activation process of Hsp33 in vitro. The Oxidized Monomer Has Partial Chaperone Activity—To analyze the activity of the oxidized monomeric variant of Hsp33, we used the same activity assays that have been previously employed to characterize the chaperone activity of wild type Hsp33 (5Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We first analyzed the influence of the oxidized, constitutively monomeric Hsp33-E150R mutant protein on the aggregation of chemically unfolded luciferase. Luciferase, once completely unfolded by incubation in high concentrations of guanidinium HCl, is unable to refold back to its native state upon dilution into refolding buffer. Instead, luciferase rapidly forms large, insoluble aggregates, which can be detected by light scattering (Fig. 2A, trace a). As previously shown, a 2-fold molar excess of oxidized Hsp33 dimer to luciferase was able to almost completely suppress the aggregation of luciferase (trace b). In contrast, the same monomer concentration of oxidized monomeric Hsp33-E150R mutant protein exhibited only a slight influence on the aggregation behavior of chemically denatured luciferase (trace d). This was very similar to the light scattering signal in the presence of reduced wild type Hsp33 monomers (trace c) or reduced Hsp33-E150R monomers (data not shown), which are considered to be largely inactive Hsp33 preparations. Very similar results were obtained when chemically denatured citrate synthase was used as a substrate protein instead of luciferase, suggesting that oxidized Hsp33 monomers are either unable to interact with highly unfolded proteins at all or that they do not exert sufficiently high affinity for these extremely aggregation-sensitive folding intermediates to effectively compete with their fast aggregation process. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we tested the activity of oxidized Hsp33-E150R monomers on the aggregation of thermally unfolding substrate proteins. Proteins that are incubated under slightly denaturing temperature conditions only slowly expose hydrophobic surfaces, and aggregate, therefore, with considerably slower kinetics (compare trace a in Fig. 2, A and B). To effectively compete with this slow aggregation process, lower chaperone concentrations, and in general, lower relative affinities of the chaperones for the substrate proteins, are required. This is shown in Fig. 2B, where a 0.5:1 molar ratio of oxidized Hsp33 dimers to luciferase was fully capable of preventing the heat-induced aggregation of luciferase (trace b). Here, the oxidized Hsp33-E150R monomer was active as a chaperone in that a 1:1 molar ratio of Hsp33-E150R monomers to heat-inactivated luciferase was as effective as a 0.5:1 molar ratio of oxidized wild type Hsp33 dimers to luciferase (compare Fig. 2B, traces b and d). In contrast, the reduced Hsp33 monomer showed again only a slight influence on the aggregation behavior of heat inactivated luciferase, which is most likely due to the oxidation of a subset of Hsp33 molecules during the time course of the experiment (trace c). Very similar results were obtained when thermally unfolding citrate synthase was used as a substrate protein instead (time point 140 min of Fig. 2C) or when the influence of Hsp33 on oxidatively damaged RrmJ was tested (data not shown). These results indicated that the influence of Hsp33 on slowly unfolding substrate proteins such as thermally unfolding luciferase or thermally unfolding citrate synthase was mainly determined by the absolute concentration of oxidized Hsp33 monomers and not by the concentration of Hsp33 dimers. This suggested that Hsp33, once oxidized, exposes a substrate-binding site, which has sufficiently high affinity for slowly unfolding proteins. To effectively compete against the fast aggregation that occurs during the refolding of completely unfolded proteins such as chemically denatured luciferase or citrate synthase, however, the substrate affinity of the chaperone must be significantly higher. This appears to be accomplished by the dimerization of two oxidized monomers, which might bring the two substrate-binding sites into close proximity and, therefore, enlarge the substrate-binding site. Oligomerization as a mechanism to increase the size and affinity of substrate binding sites is a common theme in chaperone biology and has been well studied with the 14-mer GroEL (12Farr G.W.

This hypothesis is also supported by the structural analysis of active Hsp33 dimers, which identified two potential substrate-binding sites, both of which involve both Hsp33 subunits (7Vijayalakshmi J.

Whole cell membrane currents with distinctive inward and outward rectification were activated by carbachol (CCh) in TRPC6-expressing cells, but not in lacZ-transfected controls. The effect of CCh was steeply dose-dependent with a K0.5 of ∼10 μm and a Hill coefficient of 3–4. A steep concentration-response relationship was also observed when TRPC6 activity was measured using a fluorescence-based imaging plate reader (FLIPR) assay for membrane depolarization. Ionomycin, thapsigargin, and dialysis of the cell with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate via the patch pipette had no effect on TRPC6 currents, but exogenous application of 1-oleoyl acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG, 30–300 μm) produced a slow increase in channel activity. The PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 0.5 μm) had no significant acute effect on TRPC6, or on the subsequent response to OAG. In contrast, the response to CCh was blocked >90% by PMA pretreatment. To further explore the role of DAG in receptor stimulation, TRPC6 currents were monitored following the sequential addition of CCh and OAG. Surprisingly, concentrations of CCh that produced little or no response in the absence of OAG, produced increases in TRPC6 currents in the presence of OAG that were larger than the sum of either agent alone. Likewise, the response to OAG was superadditive following prior stimulation of the cells with near threshold concentrations of CCh. Overall, these results suggest that generation of DAG alone may not fully account for activation of TRPC6, and that other receptor-mediated events act synergistically with DAG to stimulate channel activity. This synergy may explain, at least in part, the steep dose-response relationship observed for CCh-induced TRPC6 currents expressed in HEK cells.

PLC catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) leading to the production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). Ins(1,4,5)P3 binds to its receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum causing a rapid release of stored Ca2+ and a transient increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Through an unknown mechanism, the depletion of internal Ca2+ stores activates so-called store-operated channels (SOC) present in the surface membrane. Ca2+ influx via SOCs causes a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i. The rise in [Ca2+]i combined with the production of DAG causes the activation and translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) to the plasmalemma where it presumably phosphorylates specific effector proteins and enzymes. When agonist dissociates from the GPCR, or following receptor desensitization, [Ca2+]i is returned to basal levels by the action of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pumps which reload internal stores with Ca2+, and by the action of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) pumps, which extrude Ca2+ from the cell, maintaining steady-state Ca2+ levels. The mammalian homologues of the Drosophila transient receptor potential (TRP) channel have emerged as primary candidates for the ion channels responsible for Ca2+ influx following GPCR stimulation (for review see Refs. 3Montell C.

In particular, the members of the TRPC subfamily have been shown in heterologous expression systems, and in some native settings to function as receptor-activated and/or store-operated channels. There are seven members of the TRPC subfamily designated TRPC1-TRPC7 (5Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Bindels R.J. Bruford E.A. Caterina M.J. Clapham D.E. Harteneck C. Heller S. Julius D.

Likewise the mechanism of activation following receptor stimulation may differ for these two subgroups. In particular, the activity of heterologously expressed TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 is increased by exogenous application of OAG (14Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T.

This result suggests that generation of DAG may be the mechanism by which this subfamily of TRPC channels is activated following GPCR stimulation. In support of this hypothesis, the activity of TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 appears to be increased by inhibiting DAG-lipase with RHC80267 (14Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T.

Whether or not DAG is the physiological activator of this subfamily of TRPC channels or simply a modulator of channel activity remains an open question. In the present study we examine the regulation of heterologously expressed human TRPC6 channels by receptor stimulation. The TRPC6 currents recorded in HEK 293 cells were similar to those reported by other groups, but the dose-response relationship for activation of TRPC6 by receptor stimulation was very steep, exhibiting a Hill coefficient of 3–4. The response to exogenous application of OAG was slow and relatively modest when compared with receptor stimulation. Interestingly, the response to OAG was unaffected by prior activation of PKC by phorbol ester, whereas the response of TRPC6 to receptor stimulation was blocked. Lastly, concentrations of agonist that produce little or no effect in the absence of OAG produced substantial stimulation of TRPC6 in the presence of this DAG analog. Together these results suggest that although DAG may modulate TRPC6 channel activity via a PKC-independent mechanism, some other GPCR-mediated event acts in a synergistic fashion to activate this channel. This synergy may explain, at least in part, the steep dose-response relationship observed. Cell Culture—HEK 293 cells were grown at 37 °C in monolayer culture in a humidified air atmosphere with 5% CO2 using Minimal Essential Medium supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution. Expression of TRPC6 in Mammalian Cells—To generate mammalian cell lines stably expressing human TRPC6, the TRPC6 cDNA was subcloned into the bicistronic vector, pIRES2-EGFP. This vector directs the production of a single mRNA that produces both the EGFP and TRPC6 protein, allowing for the direct identification of transfected cells by fluorescence. The pIRES-TRPC6 plasmid was introduced into HEK 293 cells with the aid of the cationic lipid, FuGENE 6. After transfection, 400 μg/ml G418 was added to the growth media to select stable transfectants. Twenty-four single clones, selected for expansion based on green fluorescence, were serially cultured under continuous selection pressure. Control HEK cells were transfected with the gene for β-galactosidase, and stable clones were similarly selected. Membrane preparations were isolated from each HEK clone and subjected to Western blot analysis for the evaluation of TRPC6 protein expression. 16 of 24 clonal cell lines were TRPC6-positive, and 1 clone in particular (i.e. clone 14) showed extensive and uniform GFP fluorescence and substantial expression of TRPC6 protein. All experiments reported in this manuscript were performed using TRPC6 clone 14, which were serially cultured under continuous selection pressure by G418. Membrane Preparation and Immunoblotting—HEK membranes were collected from confluent cultures. Briefly, cells were harvested, resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5), and sonicated for 30 s on ice. Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 6000 × g to remove nuclei, and a crude membrane fraction was isolated from the resultant supernatant by centrifugation at 40,000 × g. The membrane pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer at a concentration of 5–10 mg/ml. Following electrophoresis (7.5% polyacrylamide), proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with an affinity-purified rabbit TRPC6-specific polyclonal antibody (9Goel M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48303-48310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and detected, following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, by SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Measurement of Membrane Potential by Fluorescence—The functional expression of TRPC6 was determined using a fluorescence imaging plate reader (FLIPR) and a proprietary membrane potential sensitive dye (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA, product number R-8034) as previously described (21Baxter D.F. Kirk M. Garcia A.F. Raimondi A. Holmqvist M.H. Flint K.K. Bojanic D. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Xie Y. J. Biomol. Screen. 2002; 7: 79-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pei L. Wiser O. Slavin A. Mu D.

HEK 293 transfectants (TRPC6 clone 14 or lacZ control) were plated at 6 × 104 per well in black 96-well clear bottom poly-d-lysine-coated plates (Biocoat, Becton Dickinson) and incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to achieve 80–100% confluence. The cell culture medium was removed, and cells of each well were washed once with 100 μl of assay buffer. NaCl assay buffer contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 0.15 CaCl2, 3.3 KH2PO4, 0.8 K2HPO4, 1.2 MgCl2, 10.0 d-glucose, 20.0 HEPES (pH 7.4). Na+-free N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG)-Cl assay buffer contained (in mm) 140 NMDG-Cl, 0.15 CaCl2, 3.3 KH2PO4, 0.8 K2HPO4, 1.2 MgCl2, 10.0 d-glucose, 20.0 HEPES (pH 7.4). 100 μl of the membrane potential dye supplemented with 30 μm 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester was added to each well. The plates were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 20 min before each experiment to allow the membrane potential dye to equilibrate across the cell membranes and to allow for cleavage of BAPTA-AM by cellular esterases. This Ca2+ chelator was included to minimize attenuation of TRPC6 channel activity by receptor-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i (see “Results”). Fluorescence was recorded using the FLIPR instrument at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 540–590 set by a bandpass filter obtained from Molecular Devices (FLIPR Filter Kit, catalog 0310-4077). After baseline readouts for ∼10 s, 50 μl of a 3× concentration of carbachol in either NaCl or NMDG-Cl assay buffer was added, and changes in fluorescence were recorded for 300 s. In those experiments where pharmacological agents were tested, the cells were preincubated for 10 min with each compound prior to stimulation with carbachol. All assays were carried out at room temperature. Electrophysiological Techniques—The giga-seal technique for current recordings was utilized in the whole cell mode. All experiments were performed on HEK 293 cells attached to circular glass coverslips, which were transferred to a perfusable recording chamber on the stage of a Nikon inverted microscope immediately before use. The extracellular solutions contained (in mm) 160 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). The normal pipette solution contained (in mm) 145 cesium aspartate, 2 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 1.1 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 and pCa 8). The high EGTA pipette solution contained (in mm) 145 cesium aspartate, 2 MgCl2, 0.3 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 and pCa 8). In some experiments, the Na+ in the bath solution was iso-osmotically replaced with NMDG. Data were obtained using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Pacer Scientific, Los Angeles, CA) and sampled on-line using pCLAMP 8.0 software. The ground electrode was an Ag-AgCl wire connected to the bath via an agar bridge containing 150 mm NaCl. All recordings were made at room temperature (∼22 °C). To generate current-voltage (I-V) relations, voltage ramps from –120 to +120 mV over 200 ms were repetitively applied at 15-s intervals. Unless otherwise indicated, the holding potential between ramps was –50 mV. All figures show representative traces corrected for liquid junction potential. Channel activation rates were determined from the normalized initial slope of current change with time immediately following addition of agonist to the bath solution and are shown as pA pF–1 s–1. Curve Fitting and Statistics—The nonlinear curve fitting module in ORIGIN graphing software was used to fit a logistic equation to the concentration-response data sets of the electrophysiology studies, whereas Graphpad Prism was the graphics software used for the membrane potential data. Comparisons between groups were performed using a Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Where indicated, n equals the number of individual cells tested under each condition. Slight variations in channel expression levels, i.e. current densities, were noted over the course of this study. For this reason, control responses were interspersed within each data set. Where comparisons are made for each condition, the data sets were obtained on the same batch of cells and within the same time frame. Activation of Human TRPC6 by Receptor Stimulation—Exposure of HEK cells stably expressing human TRPC6 (TRPC6 clone 14 cells) to carbachol (CCh) resulted in a time-dependent activation of whole cell membrane current with distinctive inward and outward rectification properties (Fig. 1). Current increased to a peak value within ∼1 min and subsequently declined slowly with time. The time course of current decay after the peak was variable from cell to cell. With Na+ as the major cation in the extracellular solution and Cs+ in the pipette, the current reversed at about –10 mV. Iso-osmotic replacement of Na+ in the extracellular solution with the large impermeable cation, NMDG+ resulted in a shift of the reversal potential to –50mV and a substantial reduction in inward current (Fig. 1A, inset), consistent with activation of a nonselective cation channel. Perfusion of the cell with a divalent-free extracellular solution after stimulation by CCh produced an immediate increase in both inward and outward current, but had no effect on the rectification properties (data not shown). Similar currents were activated in >95% of the TRPC6 clone 14 cells tested, but were never observed in lacZ-transfected controls. TRPC6 currents were also activated by extracellular ATP (100 μm) and blocked by La3+ (IC50 = 13 μm) and by 50 μm SK&F 96365 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the currents recorded in TRPC6 clone 14 cells are similar to TRPC6 currents reported by other investigators (14Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 16Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y. Shimizu S. Naitoh S. Ito Y. Mori Y. Circ.

Chem. 2003; 278: 3562-3571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) No activation of TRPC6 was seen in response to ionomycin or thapsigargin (data not shown), suggesting that the TRPC6 channels were not activated by depletion of the internal Ca2+ stores. However, the subsequent response of ionomycin-treated cells to CCh was significantly reduced compared with nontreated cells suggesting that a rise [Ca2+]i may cause feedback inhibition. Inactivation by a rise in [Ca2+]i has been reported for mouse TRPC6 channels expressed in HEK cells (16Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y. Shimizu S. Naitoh S. Ito Y. Mori Y. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis more directly, EGTA in the pipette solution was increased from 1.1 to 10 mm with a corresponding change in the added Ca2+ such that the initial calculated free Ca2+ level remained constant (pCa = 8; Fig. 1B). A 5-fold increase in CCh-induced TRPC6 currents was observed with high EGTA in the pipette solution, i.e. with a greater Ca2+ buffer capacity (Fig. 1C). The activation of TRPC6 by CCh was dose-dependent (Fig. 2). The major effect of increasing agonist concentration was a change in the rate of current activation. A plot of current activation rate as a function of CCh concentration yielded an apparent K0.5 of 8.9 and 8.8 μm and a Hill coefficient of 3.2 and 4.3 for outward and inward TRPC6 currents, respectively. To more fully explore the dose-response relationship, a high throughput fluorescence-based assay was developed for the measurement of membrane potential using a FLIPR. As noted above, a rise in [Ca2+]i appears to attenuate receptor-mediated activation of TRPC6. Therefore, these experiments were performed in extracellular buffer containing low Ca2+, and the cells were preloaded with the Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA. As seen in Fig. 3A, addition of KCl under these conditions to the extracellular solution of cells equilibrated with the potential sensitive dye, caused a time- and concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence in TRPC6 clone 14. The normalized change in fluorescence was a linear function of the log[K+]o consistent with membrane depolarization (Fig. 3B). Addition of CCh caused a similar time- and concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence in TRPC6 clone 14 cells, but not in lacZ-transfected controls (Fig. 3, C and D). The CCh response was blocked by iso-osmotic replacement of the Na+ in the extracellular buffer with NMDG+ (Fig. 3D) and by SK&F 96365 (IC50 = 5 μm), but not by nifedipine (data not shown). A plot of the normalized peak dye response as a function of CCh concentration yielded an apparent K0.5 of ∼1 μm and a Hill coefficient of 1.9 (Fig. 3D). These results are consistent with an agonist-induced, TRPC6-dependent membrane depolarization, and provide additional evidence for the steep dose-response relationship observed in the whole cell current recordings.Fig. 3Effect of CCh on the fluorescence response of a membrane potential dye in TRPC6 clone 14.A, fluorescence response of a potential-sensitive dye, pre-equilibrated with TRPC6-expressing cells, was recorded as described under “Material and Methods” using a FLIPR. Representative raw data traces from a single FLIPR experiment are shown superimposed. Vehicle (traces a–e) or CCh (10 μm, trace f) was added at arrow 1. Vehicle (trace a) or KCl was added at arrow 2 to make the final concentration equal to 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 25 mm (traces b–f, respectively). B, relative fluorescence units (RFU) were calculated from the maximum fluorescence value (Max) after addition of KCl and the minimum fluorescence value (Min) immediately before addition of KCl. Symbols shown represent the mean ± S.E. from 8 wells. C, same as in A with CCh added at time 3 min. The concentration of CCh was 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 for traces b–g, respectively (trace a, vehicle only). D, CCh concentration-response in TRPC6 clone 14 (▪) is compared with that obtained in lacZ-transfected control cells (▴), and when Na+ is replaced by NMDG+ in the assay buffer (•). RFU were calculated as described in B. Data shown represent the mean ± S.E. from 16 wells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Activation of TRPC6 by Diacylglycerol—Muscarinic receptor stimulation by CCh activates PLC and produces two second messengers, DAG and Ins(1,4,5)P3. Previous investigators have shown that inclusion of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in the pipette solution has no effect on TRPC6 channel activity (14Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T.

Preliminary experiments confirmed this result in TRPC6 clone 14 cells (n = 14) suggesting the Ins(1,4,5)P3 alone is not sufficient to activate TRPC6. Previous investigators have also reported that exogenous application of the membrane permeant DAG analogue, oleoyl acetyl glycerol (OAG), activates TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 channels (14Hofmann T.

As shown in Fig. 4, 100 μm OAG caused a small (compared with CCh), but statistically significant activation of TRPC6 current. The currents activated by OAG exhibited the characteristic current-voltage relationship indicative of TRPC6. Increasing OAG to 300 μm had no further effect on TRPC6 channel activity (Fig. 4), and OAG had no effect on membrane current in the absence of TRPC6 channel expression (not shown). We were surprised by the relatively poor activation of TRPC6 by OAG, as other groups had reported rather robust activation of TRPC3 and TRPC6 (14Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 20Trebak M. Bird G.S. McKay R.R. Birnbaumer L. Putney J.W.J. J. Biol.

Likewise, application of OAG to HEK cells transiently transfected with pIRES-TRPC6 yielded currents of low amplitude relative to CCh controls (n = 6, data not shown). Thus, it appears that exogenous OAG is at best, a modest activator of TRPC6 under the conditions used here. To determine whether the small effect of OAG on TRPC6 clone 14 was because of the activation of PKC, cells were pretreated with the PKC activator PMA. PMA had no acute effect on membrane current in TRPC6 cells or on the ability of OAG to activate TRPC6 channels (Fig. 5). In fact, the response to OAG was slightly but not significantly (p = 0.3) enhanced by PMA pretreatment. In striking contrast, the response to 100 μm CCh was reduced on average 93% by pretreatment with PMA. Thus, as previously reported (14"
https://openalex.org/W2159237107,"The inherent complexity of thermodynamic coupling in proteins presents a major challenge in understanding and engineering protein function. Recent work has argued that the study of proteins can be simplified by the use of correlated mutations in the evolutionary record to locate a small subset of thermodynamically coupled residues that participate in functionally important, evolutionarily conserved energetic pathways. To test this hypothesis, we examined the predictions of correlated mutation algorithms for a number of proteins for which coupling between residues has been determined by analysis of double mutant cycles. We find that correlated mutation algorithms can find residue pairs that are physically close and that physically close residue pairs tend to be thermodynamically coupled. We find little evidence, however, for the hypothesis that thermodynamic coupling is limited to the subset of evolutionarily constrained residue positions.

We find that correlated mutation algorithms can find residue pairs that are physically close and that physically close residue pairs tend to be thermodynamically coupled. We find little evidence, however, for the hypothesis that thermodynamic coupling is limited to the subset of evolutionarily constrained residue positions. When residues in a protein are thermodynamically coupled, changing one residue affects the energetics of all coupled residues obscuring the interpretation of site-directed mutagenesis experiments and complicating our ability to understand and engineer protein function (1Chen J. Stites W.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14004-14011Google Scholar, 2Green S.M. Meeker A.K. Shortle D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5717-5728Google Scholar, 3Skinner M.M. Terwilliger T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10753-10757Google Scholar). A common technique for understanding thermodynamic coupling is the double mutant cycle, in which the energetic independence of two residue positions is established if the sum of the free energy changes of two independent mutations is equal to the free energy change of the double mutant (4Carter P.J. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 835-840Google Scholar, 5Horovitz A. Fold Des. 1996; 1: R121-R126Google Scholar). Even a modestly sized protein, however, has hundreds of millions of possible double mutations that render systematic laboratory study of double mutant cycles impractical. How can an appropriate subset of residues be chosen for experimental study?An obvious place to look for guidance is the evolutionary record. One approach to relating information in protein sequence databases to protein energetics involves the detection of correlated mutations. If every time a given residue in a column of an alignment changes, there is a corresponding change in another column of the alignment, then the two corresponding residue positions may be energetically linked and under selective pressure. In 1994, Horovitz et al. (6Horovitz A. Bochkareva E.S. Yifrach O. Girshovich A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 133-138Google Scholar) proposed that coordinated changes between two columns in a protein sequence alignment predicted non-additivity in the results of the corresponding double mutant cycle. In a series of papers, Ranganathan and colleagues (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar, 8Suel G.M. Lockless S.W. Wall M.A. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14445-14450Google Scholar) have expanded on this idea to argue that a correlated mutation algorithm could be used to find “pathways of energetic connectivity” that “have emerged early in the evolution of the protein folds and, much like the atomic structure, are fundamentally conserved features of the domain families” (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar). If this hypothesis were generally true, it would have profound consequences for experimental protein science. Rather than attempting to perform experiments on unmanageably complex networks of coupled residues, computational screens of aligned sequences could lead investigators to the small subset of important residues that form “evolutionarily conserved sparse networks” (8Suel G.M. Lockless S.W. Wall M.A. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Google Scholar) of thermodynamically linked energetic pathways.In this study, we wanted to test the hypothesis that information in multiple sequence alignments can generally be used to find conserved energetic pathways in proteins. Toward that end, we examined four published double mutant cycle data sets. We found that correlated mutation algorithms predict the results of only one of these four data sets. Our results argue against the general principle that there are isolated pathways of evolutionarily conserved energetic connectivity in proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe Gobel covariance algorithm (11Gobel U. Sander C. Schneider R. Valencia A. Proteins. 1994; 18: 309-317Google Scholar) was implemented as previously described (12Fodor A. Aldrich R. Proteins. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). The SCA 1The abbreviation used is: SCA, statistical coupling analysis. algorithm was implemented as previously described (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar, 13Dekker J. Fodor A. Aldrich R. Yellen G. Bioinformatics. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar) except that when performing calculations for the PDZ family, the (i,j) ordering was constrained so that the residue at the equivalent position to position 76 reported by Lockless and Ranganathan (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar) was always in the i position. This was done so that our results in Fig. 1D would correspond as closely as possible to Fig. 3C of Lockless and Ranganathan (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar). There are still small differences between our Fig. 1D and their Fig. 3C, which we believe can be explained by differences in the alignments that were used. Lockless and Ranganathan (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar) created their own alignment with PSI-BLAST, while we used the Pfam PDZ alignment. In addition, there are significant changes in the description of the SCA algorithm and its implementation in the Windows binaries distributed by the Ranganathan laboratory (see the “Methods” section of Dekker et al. (13Dekker J. Fodor A. Aldrich R. Yellen G. Bioinformatics. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar)), which may be a cause of some of the differences between the two figures.Fig. 3Combined ΔΔG versus distance plots for the PDZ binding domain (7Lockless S.W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar) to the 1BE9 Protein Data Bank (16Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Google Scholar) structure. For the Barnase-Barnstar complex the 1BRS Protein Data Bank crystal structure was used. Distances were calculated as the average Cβ-Cβ distance for each pair of residues of the AD, BE, and CF complexes. For the Staphylococcal Nuclease data sets, the SNase Pfam alignment was downloaded, and the NUC_STAAU sequence was aligned to the 2SNS Protein Data Bank structure. The SNase alignment did not extend to residue 7 of 2SNS. The 10 double-mutant cycle data points from Green and Shortle (17Green S.M. Shortle D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10131-10139Google Scholar), which involved residue 7, were therefore excluded from Fig. 2, D and E, but not from Fig. 3. (Note that what we call ΔΔG was referred to as ΔΔΔG in the Green and Shortle paper (17Green S.M. Shortle D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10131-10139Google Scholar)). For the potassium channel data set, the Q9YDF8 sequence in the ion_trans Pfam family was aligned to the 1ORQ crystal structure. Because the Shaker sequence (CIKS_DROME) in the ion_trans Pfam alignment did not extend to Shaker residue 366, the single data point for Leu366 → Val476 was excluded from Fig. 2F. For all Pfam families, redundant sequences with (>90% identity) were removed. Because we wanted to include as much energy data as possible, we filtered the Pfam alignments in a slightly less rigorous way than in our previous study (12Fodor A. Aldrich R. Proteins. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar); specifically, we considered lowercase symbols to be valid Pfam residues, and we only excluded a column from the analysis that had greater than 90% gapped residues. These changes from our previous methods had virtually no effect on the overall power of the covariance algorithms (data not shown).Fig. 2The relationship between non-additivity in free energy, Gobel covariance, and Cβ-Cβ distance for the Green and Shortle (17Green S.M.

In their paper, Lockless and Ranganathan (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar) report data for a double mutant V32I/H76Y. However, in the 1BFE and 1BE9 PDZ crystal structures (from Doyle et al. (18Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Google Scholar) referenced as footnote 21 in the Lockless and Ranganathan (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar) paper), the equivalent position to Val32 is already an isoleucine. The nearest valine is 13 residues upstream. Data from V32I/H76Y were therefore excluded from all our analyses.RESULTSCorrelated Mutations as Predictors of Distance and Energy—Before they were used in an attempt to map protein energetics (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar), it was recognized that correlated mutation algorithms find pairs of residues that are close in physical space in a protein structure (11Gobel U. Sander C. Schneider R. Valencia A. Proteins. 1994; 18: 309-317Google Scholar, 12Fodor A. Aldrich R. Proteins. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 19Altschuh D. Lesk A.M. Bloomer A.C. Klug A. J. Mol.

Proteins. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar), we observed that a correlated mutation algorithm first described by Gobel et al. (11Gobel U. Sander C. Schneider R. Valencia A. Proteins. 1994; 18: 309-317Google Scholar) was able to use alignments from the Pfam (14Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Google Scholar) data base to correctly predict physically close residue pairs in the corresponding PDB structures at a statistically significant level (p < 0.05) for over 91% of the 224 protein families we studied. Fig. 1A shows pair distance as a function of the Gobel covariance algorithm for a member of the PDZ binding domain family. For each point in Fig. 1A, the value on the x axis represents the degree of correlation between residue changes in two columns of the PDZ multiple sequence alignment downloaded from the Pfam data base. The corresponding value on the y axis is the Cβ-Cβ distance between the corresponding residues in the 1BE9 crystal structure. As we would expect from our previous work on other protein families (12Fodor A. Aldrich R. Proteins. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar), the most highly covarying pairs of residues (to the right on the x axis) tend to be physically close (to the bottom of the y axis).With unlimited resources, an evaluation of the hypothesis that the results of correlated mutation algorithms can predict the results of double mutant cycle experiments would measure the non-additivity of double mutant cycles for every possible residue pair in a protein. Such an experiment is, of course, not feasible. To evaluate their hypothesis that “pathways of energetic connectivity” are “fundamentally conserved features of the domain families”, Lockless and Ranganathan (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar) had to choose a subset of residue pairs for which to create double mutants for the PDZ family. In their study, Lockless and Ranganathan (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar) introduced a novel correlated mutation algorithm, which they called SCA for statistical coupling analysis. The relationship between SCA covariance and pair distance for the PDZ alignment and 1BE9 crystal structure is shown in Fig. 1B. Because they were explicitly testing the power of a correlated mutation algorithm, they chose a subset of residue pairs that had a wide range of covariance scores under the SCA algorithm (Fig. 1B, gray symbols).In a previous study of 224 protein families (12Fodor A. Aldrich R. Proteins. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar), we found that the SCA covariance algorithm tends to have less power than the Gobel covariance algorithm in finding physically close residue pairs. The PDZ family in Fig. 1, A and B, is no exception to this trend, as the most highly covarying residue pairs under Gobel covariance (Fig. 1A) are closer together than the most highly covarying pairs under SCA (Fig. 1B). Nonetheless, despite these differences, the subset of residue pairs chosen for experimental analysis by Lockless and Ranganathan (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B, gray symbols) have a wide range of scores under both algorithms. The relationship between ΔΔG, the non-additivity of double mutant cycle experiments, and covariance is shown for the Gobel algorithm in Fig. 1C and for SCA in Fig. 1D. We see that under both of these algorithms, these two values are nicely correlated. These correlations provide evidence for the hypothesis that energetic coupling is under tight evolutionary control.We were curious as to how well this relationship between correlated mutations and the non-additivity of double mutant cycle experiments would hold up when applied to other double mutant cycle data sets. The labor-intensive nature of performing double mutant cycles has led to the creation of few data sets large enough to have the potential to generate a meaningful correlation. Moreover, many double mutant cycle data sets are between proteins and their peptide or protein binding partners (23Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 131-139Google Scholar, 24Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Google Scholar, 25Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Google Scholar), which makes them unsuitable for a correlated mutation analysis that needs to be performed on a single protein alignment. There are, however, two appropriately large sets of double mutant cycles based on the folding energetics of Staphylococcal Nuclease (1Chen J. Stites W.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14004-14011Google Scholar, 17Green S.M. Shortle D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10131-10139Google Scholar). In these data sets, free energy differences between the folded and unfolded state of Staphylococcal Nuclease were estimated by monitoring fluorescent changes as the protein was denatured using guanidine hydrochloride. In addition, there is a double mutant cycle data set based on the energetics of pore opening of the Shaker K+ channel in which currents were recorded across a range of voltages, and free energy differences between the open and closed state were generated from a model that assumed that mutations effect a single opening transition (26Yifrach O. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 231-239Google Scholar). Fig. 2, A and B, show that, as we would expect, the most highly covarying residue pairs under Gobel covariance tend to have small Cβ-Cβ distances in a corresponding crystal structure for Staphylococcal Nuclease. While there is no crystal structure of the Shaker potassium channel, Fig. 2C shows that the most highly covarying residue pairs under Gobel covariance are physically close in the 1ORQ crystal structure, a prokaryotic homologue (KvAP) of the Shaker potassium channel. For all three data sets, however, there is no correlation between the non-additivity of free energy and the degree of correlated mutations (Fig. 2, D-F; Table I). This lack of correlation argues against the idea that double mutant cycle experiments reliably lead us to energetic pathways that are fundamentally conserved features (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar) of domain families.Table IThe performance of different covariance algorithms in predicting thermodynamic coupling for the four data sets shown in Figs. 1, C and D, and 2, D-FAlgorithmPDZsNuclease 1sNuclease 2ShakerGobel et al.

Aldrich R. Proteins. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). In addition to the Gobel covariance method, we examined the ability of other covariance algorithms, including the SCA algorithm (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar, 8Suel G.M. Lockless S.W. Wall M.A. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Google Scholar), to predict the results of double mutant cycle experiments. We found a similar level of performance from all of the algorithms that we examined (Table I). It therefore seems unlikely that our results can be explained by our choice of a particular covariance algorithm.A potential source of error in these methods is the multiple sequence alignments fed to the covariance algorithms. If there were biases or errors in the construction of the Pfam alignments that we used, it might explain why correlated mutation algorithms failed to predict energetic coupling. However, as can be seen in the top panels of Figs. 1 and 2, the Gobel correlated mutation algorithm was able to use the Pfam alignments to successfully predict physically close residue pairs. The probability that a random pairing algorithm could do as well as Gobel covariance in finding residues below the 50th pair distance percentile for the top 75 pairs of residues is p < 10-7 or smaller for the families shown in Figs. 1A and 2, A-C. The fact that the information in the alignments can successfully be used to discover close residue pairs suggests that the use of Pfam alignments is appropriate for the problem at hand and argues against errors or biases in these alignments causing the poor correlations observed in Fig. 2, D-F.Distance as a Predictor of Energy—Why is there such a striking correlation for the PDZ family (Fig. 1, C and D), while the other three data sets show no correlation (Fig. 2, D-F)? Because the PDZ data set was created to explicitly test the results of a correlated mutation algorithm, some of the PDZ residue pairs that were chosen have high covariance ranks (Fig. 1, A and B, gray symbols). For the other protein domains, none of the chosen residue pairs ranked among the most highly covarying residue pairs (Fig. 2, A-C, gray symbols). As we see in the top panels of Figs. 1 and 2, and has been shown repeatedly in the literature, pairs of residues with the highest scores under correlated mutation algorithms tend to be physically close (11Gobel U. Sander C. Schneider R. Valencia A. Proteins. 1994; 18: 309-317Google Scholar, 12Fodor A. Aldrich R. Proteins. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 19Altschuh D. Lesk A.M. Bloomer A.C. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 693-707Google Scholar, 20Olmea O. Rost B. Valencia A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 1221-1239Google Scholar, 21Larson S.M. Di Nardo A.A. Davidson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 433-446Google Scholar). The forces that can generate thermodynamic coupling in proteins also tend to work over fairly short distances (1Chen J. Stites W.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14004-14011Google Scholar). For example, a recent study estimates that helix interactions are more likely to occur when α-carbons are less than 12 Å apart (27Lee S. Chirikjian G.S. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1105-1117Google Scholar). It therefore seems likely that at least part of the reason that a covariance algorithm is able to find coupled residues is that highly covarying residue pairs tend to be physically close.To investigate the relationship between distance and thermodynamic coupling, we looked for double mutant cycle data sets for which there was a know structure (>90% sequence identity) and for which energetic coupling data were reported across a wide range of distances (up to at least 15 Å). Fig. 3 shows the results for three such double mutant cycle data sets. The blue symbols are from a Barnase-Barnstar double mutant cycle data set (25Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Google Scholar). While we could not perform a correlated mutation analysis of the complexed Barnase-Barnstar proteins, since such an analysis requires an alignment from a single protein family, there is a crystal structure of the Barnase-Barnstar complex available that allows for a plot of distance versus non-additivity in energy. The red symbols in Fig. 3 are from the PDZ study (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar) shown in Fig. 1. The black symbols are from the Staphylococcal Nuclease study (17Green S.M. Shortle D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10131-10139Google Scholar) shown in Fig. 2D. There is a consistent trend across all three data sets in Fig. 3 with pronounced thermodynamic coupling much more likely to occur if the Cβ-Cβ distance of the residue pair is less than ∼12 Å.Our observation that thermodynamic coupling is largely limited to physically close residue pairs is not surprising. Indeed, a number of double mutant cycle studies (23Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 131-139Google Scholar, 24Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Google Scholar) have argued that thermodynamic coupling can be used to find physically close residue pairs in protein-peptide complexes for which there is no available crystal structure. Nonetheless, the interpretation of the relationship between energetic non-additivity and distance can vary quite a bit from study to study. For example, the Barnase-Barnstar (25Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Google Scholar) study (data plotted as blue symbols in Fig. 3) concluded that “coupling energy between two residues was found to decrease with the distance between them.” The Staphylococcal Nuclease study (17Green S.M. Shortle D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10131-10139Google Scholar) (data plotted as black symbols in Fig. 3), on the other hand, came to the opposite conclusion that there were patterns of interactions at “widely separated positions.” It is apparent from Fig. 3, however, that despite the different conclusions, the data from these two studies overlap a good deal.Part of the evidence from Lockless and Ranganathan (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar) for the idea that correlated mutation algorithms can predict the results of thermodynamic coupling is that the SCA algorithm predicted a “set of energetically coupled positions... that includes unexpected long range interactions” and that “mutational studies confirm these predictions” (7Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar). This line of argument suggests that correlated mutation algorithms can find energetically connected residues that could not be discovered by examining close residues in crystal structures. However, in the PDZ data set, the residue pairs that showed non-additivity > 1.5 kcal/mol were within 8 Å of each other and the only residue pair > 20 Å apart showed very little energetic connectivity (Fig. 3, red symbols). Moreover, the PDZ distance versus energy data (Fig. 3, red symbols) can be roughly superimposed with the two other double mutant cycle data sets (Fig. 3, blue and black symbols). This suggests that the “long range” thermodynamic coupling observed in the PDZ experiment was not unusual and that across all three data sets pronounced thermodynamic coupling is more likely to occur among close residues. Correlated mutation algorithms reliably find physically close residue pairs (12Fodor A. Aldrich R. Proteins. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar) but do not reliably find energetically coupled pairs (Fig. 2, D-F). The most parsimonious explanation, therefore, of the ability of correlated mutation algorithms to discover energetically linked residues is that correlated mutation algorithms discover physically close residues. The close residues discovered by correlated mutation algorithms, however, are not part of a “sparse network” (8Suel G.M. Lockless S.W. Wall M.A. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Google Scholar) of energetically linked residues. Rather, any algorithm that chooses a set of physically close residues might detect thermodynamic coupling. In particular, it has been demonstrated repeatedly (12Fodor A. Aldrich R. Proteins. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 28Taylor W.R. Hatrick K. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 341-348Google Scholar, 29Olmea O. Valencia A. Fold Des. 1997; 2: S25-S32Google Scholar, 30Schueler-Furman O. Baker D. Proteins. 2003; 52: 225-235Google Scholar) that highly conserved residues also tend to cluster together in the protein core. We would expect, therefore, that these clustered sets of conserved residues, like the clustered sets of covarying residues, would tend to be thermodynamically coupled.DISCUSSIONConserved columns in multiple sequence alignments have successfully been used to find buried residues in the protein core (30Schueler-Furman O. Baker D. Proteins. 2003; 52: 225-235Google Scholar). It has also been found that mutation of conserved residues is often associated with disruption of protein function and disease causing phenotypes (31Mooney S.D. Klein T.E. BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; http://biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/24Google Scholar). Despite these successful applications of sequence information to predicting protein structure and function, attempts to relate the evolutionary record to protein energetics have been controversial. For example, it has been proposed that conserved residues are more likely to participate in the structure of the folding-unfolding transition state (32Shakhnovich E. Abkevich V. Ptitsyn O. Nature. 1996; 379: 96-98Google Scholar, 33Mirny L. Shakhnovich E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 123-129Googl"
https://openalex.org/W2020523973,"We have cloned, sequenced, and expressed a human cDNA encoding 1-d-myo-inositol-3-phosphate (MIP) synthase (hINO1). The encoded 62-kDa human enzyme converted d-glucose 6-phosphate to 1-d-myo-inositol 3-phosphate, the rate-limiting step for de novo inositol biosynthesis. Activity of the recombinant human MIP synthase purified from Escherichia coli was optimal at pH 8.0 at 37 °C and exhibited Km values of 0.57 mm and 8 μm for glucose 6-phosphate and NAD+, respectively. NH4+ and K+ were better activators than other cations tested (Na+, Li+, Mg2+, Mn2+), and Zn2+ strongly inhibited activity. Expression of the protein in the yeast ino1Δ mutant lacking MIP synthase (ino1Δ/hINO1) complemented the inositol auxotrophy of the mutant and led to inositol excretion. MIP synthase activity and intracellular inositol were decreased about 35 and 25%, respectively, when ino1Δ/hINO1 was grown in the presence of a therapeutically relevant concentration of the anti-bipolar drug valproate (0.6 mm). However, in vitro activity of purified MIP synthase was not inhibited by valproate at this concentration, suggesting that inhibition by the drug is indirect. Because inositol metabolism may play a key role in the etiology and treatment of bipolar illness, functional conservation of the key enzyme in inositol biosynthesis underscores the power of the yeast model in studies of this disorder.

Inositol, a six-carbon cyclitol, is found ubiquitously in biological systems (1Majumder A.L. Johnson M.D. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Hait N.C. Majumder A.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These inositol-containing metabolic products convey signals for a wide variety of hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters (5Hokin L.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 205-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 6Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar, 7Berridge M.J.

Inositol metabolism is implicated in the etiology and treatment of bipolar disorder, a severe psychiatric illness that affects 1–2% of the general population (10Weissman M.M. Leaf P.J. Tischler G.L.

Lithium and valproate (VPA) 1The abbreviations used are: VPA, valproate; G-6-P, d-glucose 6-phosphate; MIP, 1-d-myo-inositol 3-phosphate; hINO1, human INO1; opi, overproduction of inositol. are the two FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of bipolar disorder. The cause of this illness is unknown, and the therapeutic mechanisms of the anti-bipolar drugs have not been elucidated. The possibility that inositol metabolism is involved in the etiology of bipolar disorder is supported by findings of aberrant inositol metabolism in bipolar patients (11Agam G. Shamir A. Shaltiel G. Greenberg M.L. Bipolar Disord. 2002; 1: 15-20Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Reduced frontal cortex inositol levels and reduced levels of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate in platelet membrane from bipolar patients have been reported (12Shimon H. Agam G. Belmaker R.H. Hyde T.M. Kleinman J.E. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 1148-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Davanzo P. Thomas M.A. Yue K. Oshiro T. Belin T. Strober M. McCracken J.

Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 2000; 149: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, inositol incorporation into membrane phosphoinositides of lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from bipolar patients is reduced (15Banks R.E. Aiton J.F. Cramb G. Naylor G.J. J. Affect. Disord. 1990; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The inositol depletion hypothesis has been proposed to explain the therapeutic mechanism of Li (16Hallcher L.M. Sherman W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10896-10901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Berridge M.J. Rev. Clin.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) resulting in decreased inositol and down-regulation of the phosphoinositide cycle. An argument raised against the inositol depletion hypothesis is that VPA does not affect inositol monophosphatase (19Vadnal R. Parthasarathy R. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1995; 12: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which is, thus, not a common target of the drugs. However, we have shown that VPA decreases intracellular inositol in yeast (20Vaden D.L. Ding D. Peterson B. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15466-15471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), although it does not inhibit inositol monophosphatase (21Murray M. Greenberg M.L. Mol.

Similar to what is found in yeast, a reduced level of inositol also was reported in rodent brain after acute 2G. Shaltiel, A. Shamir, J. Shapiro, D. Ding, E. Dalton, M. Bialer, A. J. Harwood, R. H. Belmaker, M. L. Greenberg, and G. Agam, submitted for publication. and chronic (23O'Donnell T. Rotzinger S. Nakashima T.T. Hanstock C.C. Ulrich M. Silverstone P.H. Brain Res. 2000; 880: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) administration of VPA. Although a number of metabolic routes emanate from myo-inositol, de novo synthesis of inositol is carried out by one set of enzymatic reactions in all organisms studied to date. d-Glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P) is converted to 1-d-myo-inositol-3-phosphate (MIP), which is subsequently dephosphorylated to myo-inositol. The rate-limiting step in inositol de novo biosynthesis is the conversion of G-6-P to MIP, a three-step reaction catalyzed by the enzyme 1-d-myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4), including an oxidation step with NAD+ serving as a hydrogen acceptor, an intramolecular aldol cyclization step, and finally a reduction step with NADH acting as the hydrogen donor regenerating NAD+ (1Majumder A.L. Johnson M.D. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). MIP synthase has been purified or partially purified and characterized from a wide range of organisms, and its active form is a multimer of identical subunits ranging in molecular mass from 58 to 67 kDa (1Majumder A.L.

Homologs of this gene subsequently have been cloned from several prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms and higher plants (1Majumder A.L. Johnson M.D. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys.

The best studied MIP synthase is the enzyme from S. cerevisiae in which expression has been characterized at the molecular level. INO1 expression is regulated by precursors of phospholipid biosynthesis, inositol and choline (31Graves J.A. Henry S.A. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1485-1495PubMed Google Scholar, 32Griac P. Swede M.J.

Henry S.A. Genetics. 1989; 122: 317-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). INO1 is fully repressed in the presence of inositol and choline and derepressed more than 10-fold in their absence. Derepression of INO1 when inositol is limiting is brought about by the positive transcriptional activators Ino2p and Ino4p. In the presence of inositol, the negative regulator Opi1p represses transcription of INO1 (37Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because inositol metabolism is so well characterized in yeast, we have utilized this model system to elucidate the effects of anti-bipolar drugs on this pathway. Employing genetic and molecular approaches to identify common targets of Li and VPA in S. cerevisiae, we have shown that both Li and VPA affect the inositol metabolic pathway. Both drugs cause a decrease in intracellular myo-inositol and an increase in expression of INO1 as well as the regulatory gene INO2 required for inositol biosynthesis (20Vaden D.L. Ding D. Peterson B. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15466-15471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, both drugs lead to a decrease in the phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine ratio (38Ding D. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, VPA abrogates the normal response to inositol depletion of inositol-responsive genes and leads to aberrant synthesis of phospholipids (39Ju S. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Given the essential role of inositol in cellular function, surprisingly little is known about the regulation of MIP synthase in human cells. Despite some studies on the biochemistry of the enzyme from various animal systems (40Maeda T. Eisenberg Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8458-8464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Naccarato W.F. Ray R.E. Wells W.W. Arch. Biochem.

Majumder A.L. FEBS Lett. 1983; 163: 46-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the INO1 gene has not been cloned from these sources. Recently, Guan et al. (29Guan G. Dai P. Shechter I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 417: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported the molecular cloning of the putative human MIP synthase cDNA. However, functional expression of the cDNA and characterization of the enzyme was not carried out. In this study, we cloned the human MIP synthase cDNA and characterized the recombinant enzyme. We show for the first time that the human enzyme is functional in yeast. Furthermore, human MIP synthase activity was decreased in cells grown in the presence of VPA. Because inositol metabolism is thought to play a key role in the etiology and treatment of bipolar illness, conservation of function of this key enzyme underscores the power of the yeast model in studies of this illness.

Briefly, cells were washed three times and resuspended in water (∼1 ml/g cells), and glass beads were added to ∼50% of the volume of the suspension. Each sample was vortexed for 10 min at 2-min intervals alternating with 2-min incubations on ice. The cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 2 min at 2,000 × g, and the supernatants were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatants were collected and frozen at –80 °C. Intracellular inositol mass per 100 μg of protein was determined by the enzyme-coupled fluorescence assay (45Maslanski J.A. Busa W.B. Irvine R.F. Methods in Inositide Research. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1990: 113-126Google Scholar). Measurement of hINO1 Expression—Ino1Δ/hINO1 cells (the ino1Δ mutant transformed with the hINO1 gene on pRS426GPD) were grown in Ura– synthetic medium in the presence or absence of 0.6 mm VPA to the early stationary phase of growth. Northern analysis was performed as described (39Ju S. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RNA probes for Northern analysis were synthesized from plasmids linearized with restriction enzymes as follows. The plasmid, restriction enzyme, and RNA polymerase for hINO1 are pGEM-hINO1, StuI, and SP6, respectively, and for TCM1 are pAB309, EcoRI, and SP6, respectively. Overexpression of Human MIP Synthase in E. coli—The recombinant constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS for expression of the protein. A single colony of BL21(DE3)pLysS containing the recombinant pRSETA/hINO1 was inoculated into 5 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The culture was incubated overnight and used to inoculate 200 ml of LB medium with the same concentration of ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Cell pellets from 200-ml cultures were used to inoculate 8 liters of fresh LB medium containing 25 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol. These cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A550 of 0.4. Production of recombinant protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm followed by incubation for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C until needed. Purification of Recombinant Human MIP Synthase—All the purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Frozen cells (10 g from 8 liters of culture) were thawed and resuspended in 150 ml of binding buffer (50 mm NaPO4, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1× protease inhibitor, pH 8.0). The cell suspension was incubated with 100 mg of lysozyme on ice for 30 min and then lysed by sonication 10 times for 30 s on ice. DNase (5 μg/ml) and RNase (10 μg/ml) were added, and this was followed by incubation on ice for another 15 min. The supernatant was separated from cell debris by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 15 min, SS34 rotor), loaded onto a Ni2+ column (Invitrogen), and allowed to bind with resin for 60 min using gentle agitation to keep the resin suspended. The purification column was then washed five times with 200 ml of washing buffer (50 mm NaPO4, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) and eluted with 60 ml of eluting buffer (50 mm NaPO4, 0.5 m NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). One-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The peak fractions containing MIP synthase were combined and loaded onto another Ni2+ column. The column was washed and the enzyme was eluted with imidazole. Dialysis—Spectrum Spectra/Por molecularporous membrane dialysis tubing (MWCO 50 kDa, Rancho Dominguez, CA) was prepared according to the suggested protocol. 10-cm strips were cut and soaked in sterile distilled H2O for 10 min. The tubing was filled to 60% of capacity, leaving a small air pocket at one end of the tube. Both ends of the tube were clamped, and the tube was soaked in 4 liters of precooled buffer (1 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 0.05 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025× protease inhibitor). Dialysis was carried out for 36 h at 4 °C with the buffer changed every 12 h. Protein Assay—Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Electrophoresis and Western Blot—SDS-PAGE was performed on Ready Gel (4–20% gradient) from Bio-Rad. Electrophoresis was carried out using the procedure described by Laemmli (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). All gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad). Western blots were performed by standard procedures using a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody against Xpress (Invitrogen) for protein expressed in E. coli, and alkaline phosphatase goat anti-mouse IgG (Promega) as a secondary antibody. MIP Synthase Assay—MIP synthase was assayed in crude extracts by the chromatographic method of Chen and Charalampous (48Chen I.W. Charalampous C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2194-2199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified MIP synthase activity was determined by the rapid colorimetric method of Barnett et al. (49Barnett J.E. Brice R.E. Corina D.L. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Purified protein was incubated in the reaction buffer in a final volume of 150 μl (100 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 5 mm G-6-P, 0.8 mm NAD+, 2 mm dithiothreitol, if not otherwise indicated) for 1 h at 37 °C. 14 mm NH+4 was included in the assays for determining optimal pH, temperature, and Km. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and kept on ice for 10 min. The precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. 200 μl of the supernatant was incubated with 200 μl of NaIO4 for 1 h. 200 μl of 1 m Na2SO3 then was added to the supernatant to remove the excess NaIO4. For the measurement of phosphate, a 600-μl reagent mixture (240 μl of H2O, 120 μl of 2.5% ammonium molybdate, 120 μl of 10% ascorbic acid, and 120 μl of 6 n sulfuric acid) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The absorbance was measured at 820 nm, and specific activity was defined as units per mg of protein where 1 unit is the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 nmol of product per min at 37 °C. For each assay, a second aliquot of the sample was measured for phosphates not released by periodate to control for phosphatase activity. This value was subtracted from the experimental sample to obtain synthase activity. A full-length human MIP synthase cDNA (1677 bp) was isolated from post-mortem brain as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cDNA encodes a protein of 558 amino acids with a molecular mass of ∼62 kDa. The deduced protein is 50% identical and 69% similar to MIP synthase from S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1). A yeast-based functional assay was employed to determine whether the cDNA encoded a functional MIP synthase. To perform the assay, hINO1 was cloned into the yeast expression vector pRS426GPD, which is constitutively expressed in high copy (50Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). This vector was transformed into the yeast ino1Δ mutant, which cannot synthesize inositol because of the disrupted INO1 gene. As shown in Fig. 2A, the ino1Δ mutant transformed with hINO1 (ino1Δ/hINO1) grew on a plate lacking inositol (I–), in contrast to mutant cells transformed with empty vector (ino1Δ/vector). To confirm that complementation of the yeast ino1Δ mutant was caused by the recombinant construct, 5′-fluoro-orotic acid was used to select for the loss of the plasmid. As shown in Fig. 2B, the ino1Δ cells containing the construct before 5′-fluoro-orotic acid selection grew on I–plates, whereas cells that lost the plasmid after 5′-fluoro-orotic acid selection did not. Yeast cells that overexpress the yeast INO1 gene excrete inositol into the medium, creating a phenotype known as opi (overproduction of inositol), which is detected by the ability of the excreted inositol to support growth of an inositol-requiring indicator strain (51Greenberg M.L. Reiner B. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1982; 100: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, the ino1Δ mutant harboring the hINO1 gene exhibited the opi phenotype. These results indicate that human MIP synthase is functional in yeast. To further characterize the function of hINO1 in yeast, cells were shifted from I+ to I–medium, and intracellular inositol, MIP synthase activity, and cell viability were assayed. As shown in Fig. 3A, following the shift to I–, intracellular inositol decreased markedly in ino1Δ cells lacking hINO1 but remained constant in cells containing the human gene. Consistent with these data, ino1Δ/hINO1 cells continued to grow, but ino1Δ/vector cells lost viability after 24 h (Fig. 3B). MIP synthase activity was high in ino1Δ cells containing hINO1 but undetectable in ino1Δ cells transformed with empty vector (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, intracellular inositol in ino1Δ/hINO1 was 30% higher than in isogenic wild type cells lacking the hINO1 gene (Fig. 3D), which most likely accounts for the inositol excretion phenotype of ino1Δ/hINO1 observed in Fig. 2C. This can be explained by the constant high level of expression of the hINO1-containing plasmid. In contrast, expression of the native yeast INO1 gene in wild type cells is regulated and expressed highly only in logarithmic phase cells (32Griac P. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25692-25698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have shown that both Li and VPA cause a decrease in intracellular inositol in yeast (20Vaden D.L. Ding D. Peterson B. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15466-15471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observed decrease in brain inositol levels following Li (52Allison J.H. Boshans R.L. Hallcher L.M. Packman P.M. Sherman W.R. J. Neurochem. 1980; 34: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and VPA (23O'Donnell T. Rotzinger S. Nakashima T.T. Hanstock C.C. Ulrich M. Silverstone P.H. Brain Res. 2000; 880: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) treatment. The Li-induced decrease can be explained by inhibition of inositol monophosphatase (19Vadnal R. Parthasarathy R. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1995; 12: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Murray M. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, a decrease in MIP levels was observed during growth in the presence of VPA, suggesting that VPA may inhibit MIP synthase (20Vaden D.L. Ding D. Peterson B. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15466-15471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, inositol and MIP synthase activities were assayed in crude extracts of ino1Δ/hINO1 grown in the presence of 0.6 mm VPA (the concentration used in therapeutic treatment). As shown in Fig. 4, in the presence of VPA, intracellular inositol was decreased 25% (Fig. 4A), and a 35% decrease in MIP synthase activity was observed (Fig. 4B). The gene was expressed at high levels in all growth phases (data not shown), and expression was not affected by VPA (Fig. 4C), indicating that the inhibitory effect of the drug was at the level of the protein. Human MIP synthase was expressed following isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS transformed with hINO1 (Fig. 5A, lanes 2–5). The His-tagged human MIP synthase protein was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography and eluted with 250 mm imidazole. The purified protein analyzed by SDS-PAGE migrated with an apparent molecular mass of ∼65 kDa (Fig. 5A, lane 6) which is consistent with the expected size (62-kDa protein plus a 3-kDa tag). Western blot analysis using anti-Xpress antibody confirmed that this was the recombinant protein (Fig. 5B, lanes 2–6). The specific activity of the purified enzyme was measured by the rapid colorimetric method of Barnett et al. (49Barnett J.E. Brice R.E. Corina D.L. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and confirmed by the chromatographic assay of Chen and Charalampous (48Chen I.W. Charalampous C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2194-2199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using [14C]glucose 6-phosphate as a substrate. Effect of pH and Temperature on Enzyme Activity—Human MIP synthase activity was measured at pH 6.0–10.0 using 100 mm Tris acetate buffer. All other components in the reaction mixture were kept constant, and assays were performed using standard conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The optimal pH of human MIP synthase was 8.0 (Fig. 6A). Enzyme activity was measured in a controlled temperature water bath from 20 to 60 °C under standard assay conditions. The temperature profile suggested that maximum activity was obtained at 37 °C, and the enzyme still was 90% active at 45 °C (Fig. 6B). Thermal stability of the enzyme was determined by assaying samples heated for 20 min at 30–60 °C. The enzyme was stable to heating up to 45 °C. However, ∼60% activity was lost upon heating at 60 °C (Fig. 6C). Enzyme Kinetics—Kinetic analysis of purified recombinant enzyme is shown in Fig. 7. When NAD+ was held constant at 0.8 mm and the G-6-P concentration varied, saturation kinetics were shown by the enzyme. The apparent Km for G-6-P was 0.57 mm (Fig. 7A). Saturation kinetics also were shown when G-6-P was held constant at 5 mm and the NAD+ concentration varied. The apparent Km for NAD+ was 8 μm (Fig. 7B). Effect of Cations on Enzyme Activity—MIP synthase activity was determined in the presence of NH4+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+. Like MIP synthase from all other organisms except Archaeoglobus fulgidus (2Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), human MIP synthase was strongly stimulated by NH+4. The activity was increased 5-fold at 5 mm NH+4 (Fig. 8A). 10 mm K+ stimulated activity 5-fold. Mg2+ and Mn2+ increased activity 2–3-fold at 1 or 10 mm (Fig. 8B). Activity was decreased 5-fold in the presence of 1 mm Zn2+ and was totally inactivated in the presence of 10 mm Zn2+ (Fig. 8B). Na+ and Ca2+ had no effect on the enzyme at 1 mm and increased activity by about 2-fold at 10 mm (Fig. 8B). Effect of VPA on Purified Human MIP Synthase—To determine whether the decrease in MIP synthase activity observed during growth in the presence of VPA (Fig. 4B) is caused by direct inhibition of the enzyme, purified human MIP synthase activity was determined in the presence of different concentrations of the drug. The enzyme was not inhibited by the therapeutic concentration of VPA and was only slightly (10%) inhibited by VPA at 10 mm (Fig. 9). This inhibition was not seen when 14 mm NH+4 was included in the reaction mixture (data not shown). We report for the first time that human MIP synthase is functional in yeast and supports growth of the yeast ino1 mutant in the absence of inositol. In the presence of a therapeutically relevant concentration of the anti-bipolar drug VPA, yeast ino1 mutant cells containing the human enzyme exhibit a decrease in MIP synthase activity and intracellular inositol. We observed previously that growth of yeast cells in the presence of VPA leads to decreased inositol monophosphate and intracellular inositol and increased INO1 expression consistent with the inhibition of yeast MIP synthase (20Vaden D.L. Ding D. Peterson B. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15466-15471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similar to the observations in yeast cells, a decrease in MIP synthase activity also was observed in crude extracts from post-mortem human brain.2 The purified recombinant human enzyme was not inhibited by therapeutic concentrations of VPA (Fig. 9). Purified yeast MIP synthase was similarly not affected by VPA. 3D. Ding and M. L. Greenberg, unpublished observations. These findings suggest that a metabolite of VPA or an inhibitor that accumulates in the presence of VPA may be responsible for MIP synthase inhibition. The current findings support the use of the yeast model to elucidate the effects of VPA on inositol biosynthesis. The properties of the recombinant MIP synthase were similar mostly to those reported for native enzymes. The enzyme was active from pH 7.5 to 10.0. MIP synthase that was partially purified and characterized from human fetal brain was optimal at pH 7.5 (53Adhikari J. Majumder A.L. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 25: 408-412PubMed Google Scholar). The Km of the recombinant enzyme for NAD+ was 8 μm, much lower than 452 μm reported for the partially purified human fetal brain enzyme but consistent with values from other sources, e.g. 11 μm for the bovine testis enzyme (42Mauck L.A. Wong Y.H. Sherman W.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3623-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), 17.9 μm for the rat testis enzyme (40Maeda T. Eisenberg Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8458-8464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 8 μm for the yeast enzyme (27Donahue T.F. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7077-7085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NH+4 strongly stimulated both the partially purified fetal brain enzyme and the recombinant enzyme. Other mono- and divalent cations also stimulated the enzyme to different extents, which may implicate a general ionic effect. The recombinant enzyme also was stimulated 1.5–2.5-fold by Li+ at 1–50 mm, consistent both with the general ionic effect and with similar results reported previously (40Maeda T. Eisenberg Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8458-8464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the therapeutic mechanism of action of Li and VPA are not known, both anti-bipolar drugs cause a decrease in intracellular inositol. In yeast, inositol is a major metabolic sensor for the secretory and unfolded protein response pathways (54Chang H.J. Jones E.W. Henry S.A. Genetics. 2002; 162: 29-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 If this function is conserved in human cells, inositol depletion by Li and VPA is a first common step that may lead to perturbation of these pathways, one of which (the secretory pathway) plays a fundamental role in neurotransmitter release. Functional conservation of MIP synthase from yeast to humans underscores the power of the yeast model to study the mechanism of action of anti-bipolar drugs in inositol metabolism. We thank William P. Tansey and Martin A. Hoyt for providing the pRS426GPD vector. We also thank Quan Zhong for assistance with the enzyme assays, Yihui Shi and Ervin Pullumbi for standardizing the MIP synthase assay in crude extracts, and all members of the Greenberg laboratory for helpful discussions and valuable suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2032708294,"Stimulation of CD86 (formerly known as B7-2) and/or the β2-adrenergic receptor on a CD40 ligand/interleukin-4-activated B cell increased the rate of mature IgG1 transcription. To identify the mechanism responsible for this effect, we determined whether CD86 and/or β2-adrenergic receptor stimulation regulated transcription factor expression and binding to the 3′-IgH enhancer in vitro and in vivo. We showed that CD86 stimulation increased the nuclear localization of NF-κB1 (p50) and phosphorylated RelA (p65) and increased Oct-2 expression and binding to the 3′-IgH enhancer, in a protein kinase C-dependent manner. These effects were lost when CD86-deficient or NF-κB1-deficient B cells were used. CD86 stimulation also increased the level of IκB-α phosphorylation but in a protein kinase C-independent manner. β2-Adrenergic receptor stimulation increased CREB phosphorylation, OCA-B expression, and OCA-B binding to the 3′-IgH enhancer in a protein kinase A-dependent manner, an effect lost when β2-adrenergic receptor-deficient B cells were used. Also, the β2-adrenergic receptor-induced increase in the level of mature IgG1 transcript was lost when OCA-B-deficient B cells were used. These data are the first to show that CD86 stimulation up-regulates the expression of the transcription factor Oct-2 in a protein kinase C- and NF-κB1-dependent manner, and that β2-adrenergic receptor stimulation up-regulates the expression of the coactivator OCA-B in a protein kinase A-dependent manner to cooperate with Oct-2 binding to the 3′-IgH enhancer.

CD86 binds to the coreceptor CD28 on an IL-4-producing Th2 cell to increase both the expression of CD40 ligand (CD40L) and the secretion of IL-4.

Furthermore, CD86 stimulation increases the level of IgG1 protein and mature IgG1 transcript produced by a CD40L/IL-4-activated B cell via a mechanism that involves an increase in the rate of mature IgG1 transcription, as determined by nuclear run-on, without affecting CSR to IgG1 or mature IgG1 transcript stability (17Podojil J.R. Sanders V.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In support of the findings that CD86 stimulation does not affect the ability of a B cell to undergo CSR to IgG1, the level of IgG1 produced by donor CD80/CD86-deficient B cells in a chimeric model system in vivo following immunization with a soluble protein antigen was not significantly decreased when compared with recipient wild type B cells (19Lumsden J.M. Williams J.A. Hodes R.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 781Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, donor CD40-deficient B cells were unable to undergo CSR to IgG1 in this chimeric model system. These data suggest that the critical signals to induce a B cell to undergo CSR to IgG1 are derived from CD40 and IL-4R stimulation. Taken together, these in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that CD86 stimulation on a B cell increases the level of both IgG1 produced per B cell and B cell survival, without affecting CSR. However, the signaling pathway(s) activated in a B cell following CD86 stimulation remains unknown, even though the short cytoplasmic tail of CD86 contains three putative PKC phosphorylation sites (20Hathcock K.S. Hodes R.J. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 62: 131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).One nervous system-derived stimulus involved in the regulation of the magnitude of an IgG1 response in vivo is the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE), which is released from nerve terminals present in secondary lymphoid tissue following immunization with antigen (21Kohm A.P. Tang Y. Sanders V.M. Jones S.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 725Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Norepinephrine binds the β2AR expressed on immune cells (as reviewed by Sanders et al. (22Sanders V.M. Kasprowicz D.J. Kohm A.P. Swanson M.A. Ader R. Felten D. Cohen N. Psychoneuroimmunology. 1. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 161Google Scholar)), which increases the intracellular level of cyclic AMP and activates PKA (23Kobilka B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 87Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 24Kohm A.P. Sanders V.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5299PubMed Google Scholar). Blockade of β2AR stimulation in vivo, by either the administration of a selective βAR antagonist or depletion of peripheral NE prior to immunization with a protein antigen, decreases the serum level of antigen-specific IgG1, the formation of germinal centers in the spleen, and the level of antigen-induced up-regulation of CD86 on a B cell (24Kohm A.P. Sanders V.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5299PubMed Google Scholar). Because a Th2 cell does not appear to express the β2AR (25Sanders V.M. Baker R.A. Ramer-Quinn D.S. Kasprowicz D.J. Fuchs B.A. Street N.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4200PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of NE on the level of IgG1 produced by a B cell appears to be direct. This was confirmed recently in vitro when stimulation of the β2AR on a CD40L/IL-4-activated B cell was found to increase the rate of mature IgG1 transcription, without affecting CSR to IgG1 or mature IgG1 transcript stability (17Podojil J.R. Sanders V.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that β2AR stimulation by NE plays a role in regulating B cell activity during a Th2 cell-dependent response in vivo. However, the signaling pathway(s) involved in the β2AR-induced increase in the rate of mature IgG1 transcription remains unknown.Evidence supports the proposal that the level of mature IgG1 transcript produced by a B cell is controlled by the 3′-IgH enhancer (26Pinaud E. Khamlichi A.A. Le Morvan C. Drouet M. Nelsso V. Le Bert M. Cogne M. Immunity. 2001; 15: 187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which is composed of four DNase I hypersensitivity regions, designated hs3A, hs1,2, hs3B, and hs4 (27Khamlichi A.A. Pinaud E. Decourt C. Chauveau C. Cogne M. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 317Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Of these four regions, hs1,2 and hs4 appear to have the strongest enhancer activity (28Stevens S. Ong J. Kim U. Eckhardt L.A. Roeder R.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Contained within both of these hyper-sensitivity regions are binding sites for a host of transcription factors, including Oct-2, which is a member of the POU family of proteins that bind to an 8-bp octamer sequence (consensus sequence ATGCAAAT) (29Clerc R.G. Corcoran L.M. LaBowitz J.H. Baltimore D. Sharpe P.A. Gene Dev. 1988; 2: 1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Although Oct-2 by itself is able to regulate a low level of transcriptional activity at an octamer site, full activity occurs only when the coactivator OCA-B is present (28Stevens S. Ong J. Kim U. Eckhardt L.A. Roeder R.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Oct-2 and OCA-B expression, respectively, are induced in a B cell following CD40 stimulation in an NF-κB-dependent and CREB-dependent manner (30Bendall H.H. Scherer D.C. Edson C.R. Ballard D.W. Oltz E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Berberich I. Shu G.L. Clark E.A. J.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and appear to be necessary for regulating the level of IgG1 produced by a B cell (33Schubart D.B. Rolink A. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Botteri F. Matthias P. Nature. 1996; 383: 538Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 34Kim U. Qin X.F. Gong S. Stevens S. Luo Y. Nussenzweig M. Roeder R.G.

Immun. 2001; 2: 69Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar).We show here that CD86 and β2AR stimulation, respectively, increase the expression of the transcription factor Oct-2 and its coactivator OCA-B via two distinct signaling pathways but that these two proteins converge at common 3′-IgH enhancer octamer binding sites. Furthermore, we also show that the CD86- and β2AR-induced increase in Oct-2 and OCA-B expression occurs in vivo. The present data are the first to show that CD86 stimulation induces an increase in the nuclear localization of NF-κB1 (p50) and phosphorylated RelA (p65) and Oct-2 expression via a PKC-dependent pathway. We also show that CD86 stimulation increases IκB-α phosphorylation via a PKC-independent pathway. These data suggest that CD86-induced PKC activity is distal to IκB-α phosphorylation. We also show that β2AR stimulation on a B cell activates CREB and increases OCA-B expression through a PKA-dependent pathway. Taken together, these data show that an immune receptor-induced signaling pathway cooperates with a nervous system receptor-induced signaling pathway to regulate the rate of mature IgG1 transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions and were used at 7-8 weeks of age. Female BALB/c (H-2d-restricted), FVB (H-2q-restricted), and Scid-ICR (H-2d-restricted) mice were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). CD86-deficient (CD86-/-) mice (H-2d-restricted) were kindly provided by Dr. Arlene Sharpe (Brigham and Woman's Hospital, Boston), and β2AR-/- mice (H-2q-restricted) were kindly provided by Dr. Brian Kobilka (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). CD86-/- and β2AR-/- mice were bred and housed within the pathogen-free facility at Taconic Farms until 7-8 weeks of age. NF-κB1-/- (p50-/-) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Upon arrival, all mice were housed at The Ohio State University in microisolator cages within a laminar flow barrier and provided autoclaved food and water ad libitum. Spleens from OCA-B-/- mice were kindly provided by Dr. Laurel Eckhardt (Hunter College, City University of New York, New York) and by Dr. Michel Nussenzweig (The Rockefeller University). All experiments complied with the Animal Welfare Act and the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals in biomedical research.Resting B Cell Isolation and Activation—Spleens were collected from nonimmunized mice, and red blood cells were lysed with 0.4% ammonium chloride. Splenocytes were incubated with anti-mouse CD43 magnetic beads following the manufacturer's directions (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA), and CD43-negative cells were collected by using AutoMacs (Miltenyi Biotec). Resting B cells were cultured at 5 × 105 cells/ml of culture medium, which consisted of RPMI 1640 medium (CellGro, Herndon, VA), 10% FBS (Atlas Biologicals, Colorado Springs, CO), 20 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol in 24-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Resting B cells were activated in the presence of CD40 ligand-expressing Sf9 cells (CD40L), prepared as described previously (17Podojil J.R. Sanders V.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), at a B cell to SF9 cell ratio of 10:1 and IL-4 (1 ng/ml (eBioscience, San Diego, CA)) in the absence or presence of the β2AR agonist terbutaline (10-6 m (Sigma)). After 16 h, either an anti-CD86 Ab (clone PO3 (eBioscience)) or a species- and isotype-matched control Ab (rat IgG2b, κ, clone A95-1 (Pharmingen, San Diego)) was added at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. For resting B cell cultures in which the cells received either a βAR-specific antagonist or an inhibitor, the cells were pre-treated for 30 min at 37 °C in culture medium alone with or without Me2SO, the βAR-specific antagonist nadolol (10-5 m (Sigma), PKA inhibitors H-89 (5 μm (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA)) and KT5720 (0.5 μm (U. S. Biological, Swampscott, MA)), or PKC inhibitors calphostin C (0.5 nm (Biomol)) or GF-109203X (5 nm, (A. G. Scientific, Inc., San Diego)). B cells were then collected, washed three times with culture medium, and activated as described above. All reagents used for resting B cell isolation and activation were negative for the presence of endotoxin, as determined by Etoxate (Sigma), a Limulus lysate assay with a level of detection of <0.1 unit/ml.In Vivo Activation of B Cells—Chemical sympathectomy was performed at 8 weeks of age. Mice were administered 200 mg/kg 6-hydroxydopamine (Sigma) in a volume of 100 μl of 0.5 m saline containing 1 × 10-3 m ascorbate as an antioxidant on three alternating days (days -6, -4, and -2 before cell reconstitution), as described previously (24Kohm A.P. Sanders V.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5299PubMed Google Scholar). Two days following the last administration of 6-hydroxydopamine, all animals received 2 × 106 resting B cells in 100 μl of PBS intravenously in the lateral tail vein. Two weeks following B cell reconstitution, mice were administered intraperitoneally anti-CD40 Ab (500 μg (clone FGK45)) and IL-4 (500 ng (eBioscience)) plus or minus terbutaline (5 mg (Sigma)) in PBS, and 24 h later mice were administered either an anti-CD86 Ab (500 μg (clone GL1)) or a species- and isotype-matched control Ab (500 μg (clone R35-95, Pharmingen)) intraperitoneally. Serum samples were collected 7 and 14 days following the initial injection of anti-CD40 Ab and IL-4. The level of serum IgG1 was determined in various dilutions of serum samples, as described previously (17Podojil J.R. Sanders V.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Western Blot—Resting B cells (10 × 106 cells) were activated as described above. For the collection of nuclear protein-enriched lysates, B cells were collected, washed three times in PBS, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The B cell pellets were resuspended by gentle pipetting in cold lysis buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and the B cells were allowed to swell for 30 min at 4 °C. Plasma membranes were lysed by the addition of 10% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma) and vortexed for 15 s, and nuclei were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 3300 × g. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in cold lysis buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and vortexed for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 × g. The nuclear protein-enriched supernatants were collected and frozen at -80 °C until analysis. For total cellular protein, cells were collected, washed three times with PBS, lysed with 500 μl of 1× lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4,1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 nm okadaic acid, and 10 nm tautomycin), and frozen at -80 °C until analysis. Protein samples (5-10 μg) were run on a denaturing 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with TBST (28 ml of 5 m NaCl, 25 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 g of KCl, and 500 μl of Tween) + 5% dried milk for 1 h at room temperature, probed with primary antibodies diluted in TBST + 5% dried milk for 2 h at room temperature, and washed three times with TBST for 5 min at room temperature. Membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies diluted in TBST + 5% dried milk at room temperature for 1 h and washed three times in TBST. Following the last wash, horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies were detected using the LumiGlo Detection Kit (Cell Signaling, Inc., Beverly, MA), and specific bands were visualized on Kodak Biomax MS film using an intensifying screen enabled film cassette. Antibodies used were anti-Oct-2 antibody (C-20), anti-OCA-B antibody (C-20), anti-c-Rel antibody (C), anti-actin antibody (C-11), anti-Oct-1 antibody (C-21) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-IκB-α antibody, anti-phospho-IκB-α (Ser-32) antibody, or anti-phospho-p65 (Ser-536) (Cell Signaling Technology).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (36Avni O. Lee D. Macian F. Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Rao A. Nat. Immun. 2002; 3: 643Crossref Scopus (447) Google Scholar). B cells (10 × 106 cells) activated as described above were collected on day 3 and fixed for 20 min on ice with one-tenth volume of 11% formaldehyde solution (in 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0)), and cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine at a final concentration of 0.125 m for 5 min. Cells were rinsed with cold PBS, resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Triton X-100, and the following protease inhibitors: 1 ng/ml leupeptin and 5 ng/ml aprotinin), and gently rocked for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were pelleted, resuspended, and gently rocked for 10 min at room temperature in buffer 2 (0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and protease inhibitors). The nuclei were pelleted again and resuspended in 6 ml of sonication buffer (1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and protease inhibitors). The suspension was sonicated 10 times for 30 s, with a 1-min cooling period on ice inbetween times. Debris was removed from samples, and 250 μl was adjusted to 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors in a final volume of 500 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8) and 1 mm EDTA) and precleared with protein A/protein G-agarose beads that had been blocked with sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 3 h with gentle rocking at 4 °C. The beads were removed, and chromatin samples were incubated at 4 °C with various antibodies overnight. Immunocomplexes were precipitated for 3 h by the addition of blocked protein A/protein G-agarose beads. The precipitates were washed seven times for 5 min each with 1 ml of RIPA buffer (50 nm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 0.7% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 m LiCl, and protease inhibitors) and resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer. The samples were adjusted to 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml RNase A, and 200 μg/ml of proteinase K and incubated at 55 °C for 3 h, followed by an overnight incubation at 65 °C to reverse the formaldehyde cross-links. The DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, precipitated in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen, and resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer.PCR was done with 2 μl of the immunoprecipitated DNA for 30 cycles (45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 56 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C), completed by 10 min at 72 °C with various primers. As a control, the PCR was done directly on input DNA purified from chromatin before immunoprecipitation. PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. The antibodies used were anti-Oct-2 and anti-OCA-B and anti-p50 as a control Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The following primers were used: hs1,2, 5′-ATTTTCCTTCGGTTTAGGGTGG-3′ and 5′-GGGAGTCACTGATGCTATTTC-3′ (321-bp product); hs4, 5′-AGAACAGGAACCACAGAGCAGAGG-3′ and 5′-GGTCATTGAAACTCATCCATAGCC-3′ (225-bp product).Quantitative Real Time PCR—Quantitative real time PCR was performed as described previously (17Podojil J.R. Sanders V.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, a common master mix (LightCycler-FastStartDNA SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm gene-specific primer) and 1.5 μl of cDNA for a final reaction volume of 15 μl was used. Each transcript was quantified used the following cycling protocol: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C denaturing for 15 s, gene-specific annealing temperature for 2 s, and 72 °C extension for 20 s. The concentration of gene-specific cDNA was quantified by comparison to a standard curve of gene-specific PCR product diluted 1:10 for concentrations ranging from 1 ng/ml to 1 fg/ml. After each real time reaction, a melting curve was generated, and samples were run on a 1.2% agarose gel to ensure that only one gene-specific PCR product was generated. Real time PCR was performed using the Roto-gene 2000 Real Time Cycler (Phenix Research Products, Hayward, CA). The following primers were used: β-actin 5′-TACAGCTTCACCACCACAGC-3′ and 5′-AAGGAAGGCTGGAAAAGAGC-3′ (annealing temperature 60 °C, 206-bp product); Oct-2 5′-ATCAAGGCTGAAGACCCCAGTG-3′ and 5′-TGGAGGAGTTGCTGTATGTCCC-3′ (annealing temperature 60 °C, 128-bp product); OCA-B 5′-TTCCTCTGGAGCGGCAAATG-3′ and 5′-CACAAAACAAAACTGGGGCG-3′ (annealing temperature 60 °C, 198-bp products); mature IgG1 transcript 5′-TATGGACTACTGGGGTCAAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGGGCACAATTTTCTTGT-3′ (annealing temperature 63 °C, 205-bp product); germ line γ1 transcript (Iγ1) 5′-CATCCTATCACGGGAGATTGGG-3′ and 5′-ATCCTCGGGGCTCAGGTTTG-3′ (annealing temperature 65 °C, 192-bp product).Phosphorylated CREB Analysis—Resting B cells were activated, and nuclear lysates were prepared as described above. Nuclear lysates were collected at 30 min following activation, and the level of total CREB and phosphorylated CREB was determined by using 10-20 μg of nuclear lysate in the TransAm™ CREB/pCREB Transcription Factor Assay Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). The level of phosphorylated CREB for each sample was normalized to the level of total CREB present in each individual sample.Electromobility Shift Assay—Nuclear protein samples were isolated as described above. To determine the presence of activated NF-κB, electromobility shift assay was performed using NF-κB-specific consensus oligonucleotide (5′-AFTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′, Promega, Madison, WI), as described previously (37Kohm A.P. Mozaffarian A. Sanders V.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, the NF-κB-specific consensus oligonucleotide was labeled with γ-32P in the following labeling reaction: consensus oligonucleotide (1.75 pmol/μl), T4 polynucleotide kinase 10× buffer, [γ-32P]ATP (2000 Ci/mol at 10 mCi/ml (Amersham Biosciences)), nuclease-free H2O, and T4 polynucleotide kinase (5-10 units/μl (Promega)) in a final volume of 10 μl. The oligonucleotide labeling reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 m EDTA and TE buffer. Nuclear protein samples (5 μg) were incubated in 5× binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences)) in the absence or presence of either an unlabeled consensus oligonucleotide or NF-κB family member-specific antibody for 15 min at room temperature. Antibodies used were anti-p50 antibody (H-119), anti-p65 antibody (C-20), and anti-c-Rel antibody (N) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Labeled consensus oligonucleotide was then added; samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and shift products were separated by electrophoresis and visualized on Kodak Biomax MS film (Fisher) using an intensifying screen-enabled film cassette (Fisher) for 4 h at -80 °C.Statistics—Data were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc analysis to determine whether an overall statistically significant change existed following activation.RESULTSCD86 and β2AR Stimulation Increase Oct-2 and OCA-B Expression, Respectively—Previous data from our laboratory using nuclear run-on analysis showed that the rate of mature IgG1 transcription is increased in CD40L/IL-4-activated B cells following either CD86 stimulation with an anti-CD86 Ab or β2AR stimulation with the agonist terbutali"
https://openalex.org/W2080258431,"Human papilloma viruses (HPVs) are small double-stranded DNA viruses that infect mucosal and cutaneous epithelium and induce cervical cancer. It has been shown that interferon (IFN)gamma suppresses proliferation of HPV-infected cells by suppressing expression of HPV E7. Here, we found that IFNgamma induces not only suppression of E7 transcription but also proteasome-dependent degradation. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1)/JAB, a suppressor of cytokine signaling, is known to be induced by IFNgamma, and functions as an antioncogene against various hematopoietic oncogenic proteins. SOCS1 contains the SOCS-box, which is shown to recruit ubiquitin transferase to the molecules that interact with SOCS1. We found that SOCS1 interacted with HPV E7 protein and induced ubiquitination and degradation of E7 in a SOCS-box-dependent manner. SOCS1 overexpression also increased Rb protein levels and suppressed proliferation of cervical cancer cell lines infected with HPV. Moreover, E7 protein levels were higher and Rb protein levels were lower in SOCS1-deficient fibroblasts infected with retrovirus vector carrying E7 gene than in wild-type fibroblasts. E7 induced anchorage-independent growth in SOCS1-deficient fibroblasts, but not in wild-type cells. These data suggested that SOCS1 plays an important role in regulating the levels of E7 protein and their transforming potential, and could be a new therapeutic tool for HPV-mediated tumors."

Abnormal expression of MAO has been implicated in several psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Human MAO B core promoter (-246 to -99 region) consists of CACCC element flanked by two clusters of overlapping Sp1 sites. Here, we show that cotransfection with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-inducible early gene (TIEG)2 increased MAO B gene expression at promoter, mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity levels in both SH-SY5Y and HepG2 cells. Mutation of the CACCC element increased the MAO B promoter activity, and cotransfection with TIEG2 further increased the promoter activity, suggesting that CACCC was a repressor element. This increase was reduced when the proximal Sp1 overlapping sites was mutated. Similar interactions were found with Sp3. These results showed that TIEG2 and Sp3 were repressors at the CACCC element but were activators at proximal Sp1 overlapping sites of MAO B. Gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that TIEG2 and Sp3 bound directly to CACCC element and the proximal Sp1 sites in both synthetic oligonucleotides and natural MAO B core promoter. TIEG2 had a higher affinity to Sp1 sites than CACCC element, whereas Sp3 had an equal affinity to both elements. Thus, TIEG2 was an activator, but Sp3 had no effect on MAO B gene expression.

Chen K. Ridd M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 197-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Although both forms of MAO are expressed throughout the body, they differ in cell- and tissue-specific expressions. Placenta and fibroblasts predominantly express MAO A (4Weyler W. Salach J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13199-13207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bond P.A. Cundall R.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1977; 80: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and platelets and lymphocytes express only MAO B (6Donnelly C.H. Murphy D.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1977; 26: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the brain, even though MAO A prefers 5-hydroxytryptamine and MAO B prefers PEA as substrate, MAO B but not MAO A was found in serotonergic neurons (7Fowler J.S. MacGregor R.R. Wolf A.P. Arnett C.D. Dewey S.L. Schlyer D. Christman D. Logan J. Smith M. Sachs H. Science. 1987; 235: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 8Thorpe L.W. Westlund K.N. Kochersperger L.M. Abell C.W. Denney R.M. Thorpe E. Ford E.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). MAO A was expressed in catecholaminergic neurons, whereas MAO B is rich in astrocytes. Moreover, MAO B but not MAO A activity increases progressively in the brain throughout adult life (7Fowler J.S. MacGregor R.R. Wolf A.P. Arnett C.D. Dewey S.L. Schlyer D. Christman D. Logan J. Smith M. Sachs H. Science. 1987; 235: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 9Arai Y. Kinemuchi H. J. Neural Transm. 1988; 72: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). MAO A and MAO B are coded by different genes (10Bach A.W. Lan N.C. Johnson D.L. Abell C.W. Bembenek M.E. Kwan S.W. Seeburg P.H. Shih J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4934-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) and are closely linked on X chromosome, Xp11.2–11.4 (11Lan N.C. Heinzmann C. Gal A. Klisak I. Orth U. Lai E. Grimsby J. Sparkes R.S. Mohandas T. Shih J.C. Genomics. 1989; 4: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Both consist of 15 exons with identical exon-intron organization (12Grimsby J. Chen K. Wang L.J. Lan N.C. Shih J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3637-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The promoter of MAO A has bi-directional activity (13Zhu Q.S. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7393-7403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and consists of a functional polymorphism in a 30-bp repeat sequence (14Sabol S.Z. Hu S. Hamer D. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking sequence of MAO B gene has been characterized. The maximal promoter activity for MAO B gene was found to be in the -246 to -99 region. This region consists of two clusters of overlapping Sp1 sites separated by a CACCC element (15Zhu Q.S. Grimsby J. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4437-4446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that Sp1 and Sp3 can bind to both proximal and distal clusters of Sp1 sites in the human MAO B core promoter (16Wong W.K. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Sp1 activates MAO B promoter activity, and its activation can be repressed by overexpression of Sp3 (16Wong W.K. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mutation of CACCC element increased the basal transcriptional activity of MAO B promoter dramatically in HepG2 and MG 1242 cell lines, suggesting that CACCC element is a repressor element (16Wong W.K. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, we have studied the transcription factors interacting with the CACCC element. It has been shown that transcription factor TIEG (TIEG1 and TIEG2) represses gene transcription and regulates cell growth, development and differentiation (17Tachibana I. Imoto M. Adjei P.N. Gores G.J. Subramaniam M. Spelsberg T.C. Urrutia R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2365-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) by binding to GC-rich sequences (18Cook T. Gebelein B. Belal M. Mesa K. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29500-29504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Zhang J.S. Moncrieffe M.C. Kaczynski J. Ellenrieder V. Prendergast F.G. Urrutia R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have shown that TIEG2 activates MAO B gene expression. TIEG2 served as a repressor through the CACCC element but an activator through proximal Sp1 sites. We also found that Sp3 represses the transcription of the human MAO B gene by means of interacting with CACCC box and activates MAO B through the proximal Sp1 sites, although transcription factor Sp3 had no overall effect on MAO B promoter, as shown previously (16Wong W.K. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cell Lines and Reagents—The SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma) and HepG2 (human hepatocytoma) cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Drosophila SL2 cells, which are deficient in Sp1-like proteins, were maintained in Schneider's insect medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and grown at 25 °C without CO2. Monoclonal anti-TIEG2 antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (BD Biosciences). Polyclonal antisera against Sp3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Human MAO B Promoter-luciferase Reporter Constructs—The BamHI/BamHI MAO B promoter fragment (-2099 to -99 bp) was cloned into the polylinker site (BglII) upstream of the luciferase gene (LUC) in the pGL2-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Serial deletion constructs were generated by restriction enzyme digestion using the pGLB-(-2099/-)99LUC as a template, followed by Klenow fill-in and self-ligation. The following restriction enzymes were used to generate the deletion constructs: XhoI/AspI (pGLB-(-1313/-99)); XhoI/SpeI (pGLB-(-868/-99)); XhoI/ApaI (pGLB-(-425/-99)); XhoI/PstI (pGLB-(-246/-99)) and BglII/HindIII (pGLB-(-2099/-261)). The restriction enzymes PstI and HindIII were used to select positive clones and to verify the correct orientation. One recombinant clone for each of the constructs was chosen, and the plasmid DNA was extracted and purified using the Qiagen Miniprep kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Human MAO B Proximal Promoter (-246 to -99 bp)—Site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to mutate potential transcription element, CACCC box, and two clusters of Sp1 sites in both the core promoter region (-246 to -99) and MAO B 2-kb promoter (-2099 to -99). Mutant promoter constructs were generated using pGLB-(-246) construct or pGLB-(-2099) as a template. Mutagenesis was carried out using the Amersham Mutagenesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for mutagenesis (with mutations in lower case) were 5′-GGCCCTGCGCTGCttCCGGCCTGCCTGG-3′ (for CACCC element), 5′-GGCTGCAGAGCTGCGttCGGGttCGGCGGCCCTGCGC-3′ (for the distal Sp1 sites), and 5′-GCCTGCGCGTAGGCttGCGttCTGGGCTGCGCGTCCGG-3′ (for the proximal Sp1 sites). The mutated nucleotide sequences of all mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transfections in SH-SY5Y, SL2, and HepG2 cells were performed using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Exponentially growing cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with 2 ml of medium and 10% fetal bovine serum; cells were grown until 50% confluence (24–36 h). For promoter deletion and mutagenesis studies, 1 μg of MAO B promoter-luciferase construct was co-transfected into the cells with 20 ng of plasmid pRL-TK (the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter fused upstream to the Renilla luciferase gene which is used as an internal control; Promega), as described previously (16Wong W.K. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Full-length human TIEG2 expression vector was a gift from Dr. Raul Urrutia (20Cook T. Gebelein B. Mesa K. Mladek A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25929-25936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. The expression plasmid pCMV-Sp3 was kindly provided by Dr. P. Charnay. For co-transfection experiments, the total amount of DNA for each transfection was kept constant by the addition of empty expression vector pCMV3.1. Gel-shift Assays—The DNA fragments (CACCC element, 5′-TGCGCTGCACCCGGCCTGCCTGG-3′, and the proximal Sp1 sites, 5′-CGTAGGCGGGCGGGCGGGGCTGG-3′) for the gel-shift assay were radio-labeled by Klenow fill-in. Labeled probes were purified by gel electrophoresis (5% polyacrylamide) and eluted in TE buffer (10 mm Tris/1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). For DNA-protein binding, 15 μg of nuclear extracts were diluted in binding buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml of poly(dI-dC); Sigma) with a total volume of 20 μl. Antibody against TIEG2 or Sp3 was added (when required), and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Labeled probe (0.2 ng) was added to the mixture and incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The binding affinity of TIEG2 or Sp3 to the CACCC element or Sp1 sites was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility-shift assay using increasing concentrations of radiolabeled CACCC element or Sp1 sites, followed by quantification of bound and free oligonucleotide (21Ou X.M. Storring J.M. Kushwaha N. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14299-14307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For super-shift assays, 1 μl of antibody was included in the reaction mix along with the extract. The samples were then run on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris/borate/EDTA at 150 V for 3 h. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. MAO B Catalytic Activity Assay—SH-SY5Y and HepG2 cells were grown to confluence, harvested, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. One hundred micrograms of total proteins were incubated with 10 μm 14C-labeled PEA (Amersham Biosciences) in the assay buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 20 min and terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 6 N HCl. The reaction products were then extracted with ethyl acetate/toluene (1:1) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. The organic phase containing the reaction product was extracted, and its radioactivity was obtained by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (22Geha R.M. Rebrin I. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9877-9882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis of MAO B mRNA—Total RNA was purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Thirty micrograms of total RNA from SH-SY5Y and HepG2 cells that were cotransfected with TIEG2 expression vector (0, 100, and 400 ng) and grown to confluence were loaded onto each gel lane. Electrophoresis, transfer onto BrightStar nylon membrane, and hybridization were carried out using NorthernMax according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). The human MAO B probe (specific activity = 2 × 108 cpm/μg) was labeled by random-priming technique using the Multiprime kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Membrane hybridized with the MAO B probe was autoradiographed for 48 h. Western Blot Analysis of MAO B Protein—Cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Forty micrograms of total protein was separated by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After the transfer, membranes were blocked at room temperature for 2 h with 5% bovine serum albumin in TTBS (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). The membranes were then incubated with rabbit anti-MAO B antibody (1:1000) overnight at room temperature. After incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 h, the bands were visualized by horseradish peroxidase reaction using diaminobenzidine as substrate (Sigma). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays and Quantitative Real-time PCR—SH-SY5Y or HepG2 cells (7 × 106 cells/150-mm dish) were plated and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described above for 2 days. Cells were cross-linked by incubating with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) at room temperature for 10 min. The dishes were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then scraped into PBS containing protease inhibitors (Sigma) and centrifuged for 3 min at 2000 rpm. Cells were resuspended in 350 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) containing protease inhibitors before sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The resulting cell lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation after the methods described by Jia et al. (23Jia L. Kim J. Shen H. Clark P.E. Tilley W.D. Coetzee G.A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 385-392PubMed Google Scholar). 35 μl of the supernatant was saved as input DNA. The nuclear protein-DNA complex was immunoprecipitated by incubating with anti-TIEG2 (with BioMag goat antimouse) or anti-Sp3 antibody (with BioMag anti-rabbit) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. They were recovered from the beads with an elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3) and were analyzed by real-time PCR using an iCycler optical system (Bio-Rad). The PCR product was determined by SyBr Green reagent (2× SyBr Green Supermix, Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. The primers for MAO B core promoter (153 bp, from -287 bp to -134 bp) and irrelevant locus (160 bp, from -1940 to -1780 bp for negative control) were, for D5 forward, 5′-TCTCCGCCCAGGCACCCGCCCTCC-3′ (bases -287 to -263); for D5 reverse, 5′-TCGGCGAGCCGCTATATTAGCCCC-3′ (bases -157 to -134); for 5′ irrelevant locus forward, 5′-TTTGCTGTCTCAGGCCCTTTATA-3′ (bases -1940 to -1917); and for 5′ irrelevant locus reverse, 5′-ATGAATGGAGAGGATCTGCTACG-3′ (bases -1802 to -1780). The PCR reactions for input, TIEG2, Sp3-associated DNA, or 5′ irrelevant locus were done in triplicate under the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of PCR consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The average threshold cycle (CT) for the triplicate was used in all subsequent calculations. A ΔCT value was calculated for each sample using the CT value for the input DNA samples to normalize the ChIP assay results, as outlined in the iCycler optical systems protocol. The ΔCT were converted to the fold induction required to reach the threshold amount of PCR by raising 2 to the ΔCT power. The relative differences between input sample and TIEG2 or Sp3 ChIP assay or negative control were determined using the ΔCT method and presented as the percent of input (taken as 100%). Data were the means ± S.D. from triplicate samples of three independent experiments. TIEG2 Was a Transcriptional Activator of the Human MAO B Promoter—To understand the function of TIEG2 in the human MAO B promoter and to identify the promoter regions which were responsible for TIEG2 function, the 5′-flanking sequence of MAO B promoter was systematically deleted, and each one was ligated to the luciferase reporter gene (pGL2-basic) and transfected into SH-SY5Y, SL2, and HepG2 cells. Full-length human TIEG2 expression vector was then cotransfected with each MAO B promoter-luciferase construct. As shown in Fig. 1 in SH-SY5Y cells, co-expression of TIEG2 increased the MAO B promoter activity up to 4-fold, when the deletion was up to -246 bp. However, the TIEG2 activation of MAO B promoter activity was abolished (Fig. 1, construct 5) when the -261 to -99 bp region was deleted. Thus, the TIEG2 response element was located in -246 to -99 bp, the core promoter region of MAO B (Fig. 1, constructs 1-4). Similar results were found in HepG2 cells (data not shown) and SL2 cells, which lack the Sp1 family (Fig. 1). Because the SL2 cell line does not have Sp1-like proteins, we found that the TIEG2 activation of MAO B promoter in SL2 cells (∼3-fold) was weaker than in SH-SY5Y cells (∼4-fold), which suggested that the interaction of TIEG2 with other Sp1-like proteins were important for the activation of MAO B promoter activity. MAO B Activity and Protein Levels Were Increased by TIEG2 in a Dose-dependent Manner—When different concentrations of TIEG2 expression vector were transfected into SH-SY5Y or HepG2 cell lines, the MAO B promoter activity (Fig. 2A), catalytic activity (Fig. 2B), mRNA (Fig. 2C) and protein levels (Fig. 2D) were increased in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that the MAO B gene expression was increased by TIEG2 in a dose-dependent manner. TIEG2 and Sp3 Were Repressors of MAO B through CACCC Element—The CACCC element and Sp1 sites in MAO B core promoter were mutated. The wild type or mutated constructs were cotransfected with TIEG2 into SH-SY5Y (Fig. 3A), HepG2 (data not shown), or SL2 cells, which lack Sp1 family (Fig. 3B). The result showed that TIEG2 activated the MAO B promoter (Fig. 3, A and B, control 1, TIEG2 versus basal) in both cell lines. Because Sp3 was found to repress the Sp1 activation on MAO B gene (16Wong W.K. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Sp3 regulated MAO B gene expression by means of the CACCC element or Sp1 sites. Sp3 itself did not have an effect upon the MAO B promoter activity (Fig. 3, A and B, construct 1, Sp3 versus basal), which is consistent with our previous finding (16Wong W.K. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). When the CACCC element was mutated into CttCC in the MAO B core promoter (-246 to -99 bp; Fig. 3, A and B, construct 2), the basal promoter activity was increased by 8-fold compared with the wild type in SH-SY5Y cell line (Fig. 3A, compare basal activity in construct 2 versus construct 1). This result suggested that the CACCC element was a repressor element. The mutation of the CACCC element destroyed the binding of TIEG2 and Sp3 to CACCC element by gel-shift assay (data not shown); thus, the increased basal MAO B promoter activity may be mediated by another cis-element, such as Sp1 element. In contrast to SH-SY5Y cell line, when CACCC was mutated, the basal promoter activity in the SL2 cell line (no Sp1 family) was not increased, compared with the wild type (Fig. 3B, construct 2 basal versus construct 1 basal). This result suggested that the Sp1 family and Sp1 sites were responsible for the increased promoter activity seen in CACCC mutated promoter construct. Cotransfecting TIEG2 or Sp3 with CACCC-mutated MAO B core promoter further activated the luciferase activity in SH-SY5Y (Fig. 3A, construct 2, compare TIEG2 or Sp3 to basal promoter activity), suggesting that TIEG2 and Sp3 were repressors at CACCC element, and the activation function of these factors might occur by means of Sp1 sites. When the CACCC-mutated construct was cotransfected with TIEG2 or Sp3 in SL2 cells, similar activation of MAO B promoter (Fig. 3B, construct 2, compare TIEG2 or Sp3 to basal) was observed. To confirm that TIEG2 or Sp3 repressed MAO B promoter activity through CACCC element, the Sp1 sites were mutated on MAO B core promoter (Fig. 3, C and D) to further study the repressor function of CACCC element. Cotransfecting TIEG2 or Sp3 with proximal Sp1 site-mutated MAO B core promoter, the luciferase activity was reduced slightly in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3C, construct 3, compare TIEG2 or Sp3 to basal) but significantly in SL2 cells (Fig. 3D, construct 3, compare TIEG2 or Sp3 to basal). Cotransfecting TIEG2 or Sp3 with both Sp1 sites mutated MAO B core promoter, the luciferase activity was decreased significantly in both cell lines (Fig. 3, C and D, construct 4, compare TIEG2 or Sp3 to basal). These results provided further evidence that the CACCC element was a repressor element for both TIEG2 and Sp3. TIEG2 and Sp3 Are Activators at the Proximal Sp1 Overlapping Sites of MAO B Promoter—When both CACCC element and distal overlapping Sp1 sites were mutated, the function of TIEG2 and Sp3 were reduced slightly in both cell lines (Fig. 3, A and B, construct 3 versus construct 2), suggesting that TIEG2 and Sp3 bind weakly to the distal Sp1 sites. However the mutation of the proximal overlapping Sp1 sites together with CACCC element occurred, the activation of TIEG2 and Sp3 were blocked (Fig. 3, A and B, construct 4 versus construct 2)in both cell lines, suggesting that the proximal Sp1 sites are important for TIEG2 and Sp3 activation. To confirm that the proximal Sp1 sites are responsible for TIEG2 and Sp3 activation, either distal Sp1 sites or proximal Sp1 sites were mutated in MAO B core promoter. Mutation of the distal Sp1 sites had slight effect on TIEG2 activation (Fig. 3, C and D, compare construct 2 to construct 1, TIEG2 activation) in SH-SY5Y and SL2 cells. On the other hand, the mutation of the proximal Sp1 sites abolished the activation of TIEG2 on MAO B promoter (Fig. 3, C and D, compare construct 3 to construct 1, TIEG2 cotransfected) in both cell lines, indicating that the proximal Sp1 sites are important for the activation of MAO B gene expression. The effects of TIEG2 and Sp3 on the human MAO B 2-kb promoter were also studied by transient transfection assay using different deletion mutants of MAO B 2-kb promoter. The effects of TIEG2 and Sp3 on the MAO B 2-kb promoter (data not shown) are similar to the effect on -246 to -99 bp MAO B core promoter (Fig. 3). All of the transient transfection experiments in SH-SY5Y cell line described above were also performed in HepG2 cells. The results were the same as SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). TIEG2 and Sp3 Interacted with CACCC Directly, as Shown by Gel-shift Assay—To confirm the presence of TIEG2 and Sp3 in the binding to MAO B core promoter region, a gel-shift assay was performed using a 23-bp DNA fragment spanning the region -222 to -201 containing the CACCC element. The radio-labeled DNA probe was incubated with nuclear extracts isolated from SH-SY5Y and HepG2 cells. Two to three major DNA-protein complexes were observed in both cell lines (Fig. 4A, lane 2 and 6). Excess of cold oligonucleotides reduced all bindings (Fig. 4A, lane 3 and 7), suggesting that these DNA-protein complexes were specific. The lower complex was completely supershifted by incubation with anti-TIEG2 antibody (Fig. 4A, lane 4 and 8), suggesting that this DNA-protein complex contained TIEG2. The upper complex was completely supershifted by incubating with anti-Sp3 antibody (Fig. 4A, lane 5 and 9), suggesting that the upper DNA-protein complex contained Sp3. These results indicated that transcriptional factors TIEG2 and Sp3 bound to CACCC element in both SH-SY5Y and HepG2 cells. To ensure that TIEG2 and Sp3 were indeed bound to CACCC element, the CACCC element in the 23-bp DNA fragment was mutated to CttCC and radiolabeled for gel-shift assay. DNA-protein complex was not found in either cell line (data not shown). TIEG2 and Sp3 Interacted with the Proximal Sp1 Site Directly, as Shown by Gel-shift Assay—To study whether the proximal Sp1 sites interacted with TIEG2 and Sp3, a gel-shift assay was performed using a 23-bp DNA fragment spanning the region -196 to -175 bp, which contains the proximal Sp1 sites. The radiolabeled DNA probe was incubated with nuclear extracts isolated from SH-SY5Y and HepG2 cells. Two or three major DNA-protein complexes were observed with nuclear proteins from SH-SY5Y cells or HepG2 cells, respectively (Fig. 4B, lane 2 and 6). Excess of cold oligonucleotides reduced all bindings (Fig. 4B, lane 3 and 7), suggesting these DNA-protein complexes were specific. The TIEG2 or Sp3 complex was completely supershifted by incubating with anti-TIEG2 (Fig. 4B, lane 4 and 8) or anti-Sp3 antibody (Fig. 4B, lane 5 and 9), respectively. These results indicated that transcriptional factors TIEG2 and Sp3 bound to the proximal Sp1 sites directly. On the other hand, TIEG2 or Sp3 protein bound to the distal Sp1 sites very weakly (data not shown). TIEG2 and Sp3 Bound to the Natural Core Promoter of MAO B—To study whether these transcription factors interacted with the natural human MAO B promoter in vivo, the occupancy of endogenous TIEG2 and Sp3 to the native core promoter of MAO B was determined by ChIP assay combined with quantitative real-time PCR. The core promoter sequence and 5′ irrelevant region (negative control) were used for occupancy analysis (Fig. 5A). The representative TIEG2 ChIP/quantitative real-time PCR amplification plots (triplicate) were shown in Fig. 5B. CT is the cycle number required to reach the threshold levels of PCR products (the dashed line in Fig. 5B). The average CT for the input sample, TIEG2 cross-linked DNA and 5′ irrelevant region, were 17.02 ± 1.02, 22.84 ± 0.69, and 29.14 ± 0.92, respectively, in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 5B). A ΔCT value was calculated for each sample using the CT value for the input DNA sample by subtracting the CT of input control and then converted to fold differences (see “Materials and Methods”). The relative differences between input sample and TIEG2 or Sp3 ChIP assay or negative control were summarized in Fig. 5C and presented as the percent of input (which was taken as 100%). The relative differences of TIEG2- or Sp3-conjugated DNA was 1.68 or 1.44%, respectively, compared with the input DNA (Fig. 5C) for SH-SY5Y cells, and 1.51 or 1.25% for HepG2 cells (Fig. 5C). Quantitative PCR analysis of 5′ irrelevant region yielded negligible values (less than 0.03% input DNA, Fig. 5C). This result indicated that anti-TIEG2 or anti-Sp3 antibody is able to immunoprecipitate the native TIEG2-DNA or Sp3-DNA complex and thus demonstrated that TIEG2 and Sp3 indeed bound to the natural core promoter of MAO B. The Binding Affinity of TIEG2 for the Proximal Sp1 Sites Was Higher than CACCC Element, but the Affinity of Sp3 Was Similar between the Proximal Sp1 Sites and CACCC Element—To understand why TIEG2 activated overall MAO B gene expression but Sp3 had no effect (Fig. 3A, construct 1), the affinity of TIEG2 for CACCC element and the proximal Sp1 sites was evaluated by gel-shift experiments (Fig. 6). TIEG2 protein was ectopically expressed in SL2 cells. The binding affinity was evaluated by using increasing concentrations of radiolabeled Sp1 sites (Fig. 6A) or CACCC element (Fig. 6B) followed by quantification of bound and free oligonucleotide (Fig. 6C). Scatchard analysis revealed that the dissociation constant (Kd) value was 0.29 × 10-9 m for TIEG2 binding to Sp1 sites, 0.46 × 10-9 m for TIEG2 binding to CACCC element. Therefore, the Kd value of TIEG2 binding to Sp1 sites is significantly lower than that of binding to CACCC element (p < 0.05). These Kd values are in the same range as for Sp1 binding to the Sp1-like sequences (24Letovsky J. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2639-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 25Cohen H.T. Bossone S.A. Zhu G. McDonald G.A. Sukhatme V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2901-2913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The same affinity analysis was performed using Sp3 protein, which was ectopically expressed in SL2 cells. As shown in Fig. 7, the binding affinity of Sp3 to the CACCC element (Fig. 7A, Kd = 0.32 10-9 M) and proximal Sp1 sites (Fig. 7B, Kd = 0.30 10-9 m) were similar (Fig. 7C). Our Results Show that TIEG2 Was an Activator for the Human MAO B Gene, although It Was a Repressor for Most Other Genes—TIEG2, also called FKLF (26Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with enrichment in pancreas and muscle. TIEG2 shares 91% homology with TIEG1 within the zinc finger region and 44% homology in the N terminus. Based upon the primary structure, TIEG2 is a nuclear protein which can specifically bind to an Sp1-like DNA sequence and can repress promoters containing Sp1-like binding sites in transfected Chinese hamster ovary epithelial cells (20Cook T. Gebelein B. Mesa K. Mladek A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25929-25936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Previous study indicated that three independent transcriptional repression domains were found within TIEG proteins. Interestingly, in contrast to several other members of the Sp1-like family, no transcriptional activation domain was found in this transcription factor so far (28Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Therefore, TIEG2 is a repressor at Sp1 sites for most of the genes (18Cook T. Gebelein B. Belal M. Mesa K. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29500-29504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Only one exception showed that TIEG2 activated promoter mediated by CACCC element, which is the human embryonic gamma globulin (29Asano H. Li X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3571-3579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of activation function of TIEG2 (FKLF) is unknown. The present study is the first time that TIEG2 has been found to activate human MAO B gene expression through Sp1 overlapping sites. TIEG2 is a TGF-β-inducible early response gene (18Cook T. Gebelein B. Belal M. Mesa K. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29500-29504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). TGF-β-mediated signaling pathways inhibit epithelial cell growth (30Chiarugi V. Magnelli L. Cinelli M. Pharmacol. Res. 1997; 35: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because TIEG2 activated MAO B, this may suggest that MAO B might have anti-proliferating functions. On the other hand, TIEG2 was found to be a repressor at CACCC element of MAO B promoter, although the overall function of TIEG2 is as an activator for MAO B. This is the first study to show that TIEG2 is a bi-functional regulator for the same gene expression. Sp1-like Proteins Play Key Roles in the Regulation of MAO B— Our results indicate that Sp1-like proteins play important roles in the regulation of MAO B gene expression, because the mutation of CACCC element resulted in a dramatic increase in the basal MAO B promoter activity in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3A, construct 2 basal versus construct 1 basal), but not in SL2 cells. This result suggests that the increase in SH-SY5Y cells was due to the mutated CACCC element and the Sp1 protein-activated Sp1 sites, because no increase was observed when there were no Sp1 proteins in SL2 cells. Sp3 Is a Bi-functional Regulator for the Same Gene Expression—This is the first study to demonstrate that Sp3 is a bi-functional regulator for the same gene. Sp3 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, closely related to Sp1 but, unlike Sp1, often functioning as a transcriptional repressor by means of interacting with GC-rich Sp1-like sites (31Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3348-3352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32De Luca P. Majello B. Lania L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Sp3 acts as a bi-functional regulator whose activating or repressing activity is dependent upon both the promoter and the cellular context (27Sun J.M. Chen H.Y. Moniwa M. Litchfield D.W. Seto E. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35783-35786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Sp3 contains independent modular repressor and activator domains. The activation potential of Sp3 is distributed over an extensive glutamine-rich N-terminal region. The negative regulatory function has been mapped to 5′ of the zinc finger region. Sp3 was found to repress transcription of promoters bearing multiple GAL4 DNA-binding sites, whereas it could activate reporters containing a single GAL4-binding site (33Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, it has not been reported that Sp3 functions as both repressor and activator in the same gene regulation. Our study is the first time to provide the evidence that repressor Sp3 for MAO B also acts as an activator via overlapping Sp1 sites, which displayed the bi-functional regulator in the same gene expression. In summary, our results indicate that TIEG2 increased the human MAO B gene expression. Both TIEG2 and Sp3 exhibited a repressor function at CACCC element but both also serve as an activator by interacting with the proximal Sp1 overlapping sites in SH-SY5Y, HepG2, and SL2 cells. This work provides the first evidence that TIEG2 activates MAO B gene through the proximal Sp1 overlapping sites. This is also the first study to show that TIEG2 and Sp3 are bi-functional regulators for the same gene. These findings may provide new insight into the regulation of not only the human MAO B genes but also to the genes bearing CACCC elements and Sp1 sites.

However, the low to moderate prevalence of sensitization to the protein, designated Hev b 7, among latex-allergic patients could not adequately explain the frequent observations of the 42–46-kDa allergen. This led to the hypothesis that another, more allergenic protein of a similar molecular mass existed in Hevea latex. We report the isolation and purification of a 42.98-kDa latex glycoprotein showing homology to the early nodule-specific protein (ENSP) of the legumes Medicago sativa, Medicago truncatula, and Glycine max. The protein is allergenic, being recognized by immunoglobulin E (IgE) in sera from latex-allergic patients. The IgE epitope resides on the carbohydrate moiety of the protein, and the presence of a similar carbohydrate component on potato tuber patatin enables the latter to inhibit IgE binding to the ENSP homologue. The cDNA encoding the ENSP homologue was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR and cloned. The protein predicted from the cDNA sequence has 391 amino acids, the first 26 of which constitute a putative signal peptide. The deduced molecular mass of the mature protein is 40.40 kDa, while its isoelectric point is estimated at 5.0. The discrepancy between the predicted and observed molecular mass might be due to glycosylation, for which three N-sites on the protein are predicted. The purified protein showed lipase and esterase activities and may be involved in plant defense.

https://openalex.org/W2050027794,"Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for thrombin, is irreversibly proteolytically activated, internalized, and then sorted to lysosomes and degraded. Internalization and lysosomal sorting of activated PAR1 is critical for termination of receptor signaling. We previously demonstrated that activated PAR1 is rapidly phosphorylated and internalized via a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent pathway that is independent of arrestins. Toward understanding the mechanisms responsible for activated PAR1 internalization through clathrin-coated pits we examined the function of a highly conserved tyrosine-based motif, YXXL, localized in the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail of the receptor. A mutant PAR1 in which tyrosine 383 and leucine 386 were replaced with alanines (Y383A/L386A) was significantly impaired in agonist-triggered internalization and degradation compared with wild-type receptor. In contrast, constitutive internalization, and recycling of unactivated PAR1 Y383A/L386A mutant was not affected, suggesting that tonic cycling of the mutant receptor remained intact. Strikingly, a PAR1 C387Z truncation mutant in which the YXXL motif was exposed at the C terminus constitutively internalized and degraded in an agonist-independent manner, whereas C387Z truncation mutant in which the critical tyrosine and leucine were mutated to alanine (C387Z-Y383A/L386A) failed to internalize. Inhibition of PAR1 C387Z mutant constitutive internalization with dominant-negative K44A dynamin blocked agonist-independent degradation of the mutant receptor. Together these findings strongly suggest that internalization of activated PAR1 is controlled by multiple regulatory mechanisms involving phosphorylation and a highly conserved tyrosine-based motif, YXXL.

Trafficking of activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; C-tail, cytoplasmic carboxyl tail; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IP, inositol phosphate; PAR1, protease-activated receptor-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, phosphoinositide; AP-2, adaptor protein complex-2. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; C-tail, cytoplasmic carboxyl tail; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IP, inositol phosphate; PAR1, protease-activated receptor-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, phosphoinositide; AP-2, adaptor protein complex-2. is a regulated process important in signal termination, receptor resensitization, and down-regulation. Upon activation, GPCRs are rapidly phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases, which facilitates the binding of arrestins to intracellular domains of the receptor (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Arrestin binding not only serves to functionally uncouple the receptor from G proteins as part of the desensitization process, but also promotes internalization of the receptor through direct and indirect interactions with components of the clathrin endocytic machinery (2Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). In many cases, agonist dissociates from the GPCR within endosomes; the receptor is then dephosphorylated and returned to the plasma membrane in a resensitized state competent to signal again. The trafficking of internalized GPCRs from endosomes to lysosomes also contributes to receptor down-regulation, another important process for signal termination (3Gray J.A. Roth B.L. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in down-regulation of GPCRs by internalization and lysosomal sorting are not clearly understood. Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), a GPCR for the coagulant protease thrombin, is the predominant mediator of thrombin-elicited cellular responses. PAR1 is activated by an unusual irreversible proteolytic event, whereby thrombin binds to and cleaves the N-terminal exodomain of the receptor. This cleavage exposes a new N terminus that acts as a tethered ligand by binding intramolecularly to the body of the receptor to cause transmembrane signaling (4Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2659) Google Scholar, 5Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Hung D.T. Coughlin S.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide SFLLRN, that mimics the first six residues of the newly formed N terminus, can fully activate PAR1 independent of thrombin and receptor cleavage. Despite the irreversible proteolytic mechanism of PAR1 activation, signaling by the receptor is rapidly terminated. The extent of thrombin-induced signaling responses precisely correlate with the absolute rate of receptor cleavage during a given time (7Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that each activated PAR1 signals, generates a defined amount of second messenger, and then shuts off. This places particular importance on the mechanisms that contribute to the termination of PAR1 signaling. The desensitization, internalization, and down-regulation processes of irreversibly proteolytically activated PAR1 signaling is poorly understood. Given the irreversible nature of PAR1 activation, we hypothesize that signal termination mechanisms are likely unique. In most cell types, PAR1 resides both on the cell surface and in an intracellular compartment (8Hein L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27719-27726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Woolkalis M.J. DeMelfi T.J. Blanchard N. Hoxie J.A. Brass L.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32874-32880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), due in part to two distinct modes of receptor trafficking. Unactivated PAR1 cycles constitutively between the cell surface and an intracellular pool. This provides an intracellular store of uncleaved receptors, which allows for rapid repopulation of the cell surface with naive receptors following thrombin exposure. After activation with thrombin or peptide agonist SFLLRN, PAR1 is internalized, sorted predominantly to lysosomes and degraded (8Hein L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27719-27726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A PAR1 mutant in which all of the serines and threonines, potential sites of phosphorylation, in the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail (C-tail) were mutated to alanines was defective in agonist-stimulated internalization and degradation, whereas constitutive cycling of unactivated receptor remained intact (10Shapiro M.J. Trejo J. Zeng D. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32874-32880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast, a mutant PAR1 in which residues between positions 397 and 406 within the C-tail were converted to alanine or glycine displayed normal internalization and lysosomal sorting when activated, but failed to tonically cycle in the absence of agonist (12Shapiro M.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29009-29014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These findings imply that separate signals regulate the distinct trafficking behaviors of unactivated and activated PAR1. Thus, the irreversible proteolytic nature of PAR1 activation may have necessitated an unusual pattern of receptor trafficking. Phosphorylation of activated PAR1 is one important component for rapid desensitization of receptor signaling and internalization from the plasma membrane (10Shapiro M.J. Trejo J. Zeng D. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32874-32880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We recently found that arrestin interaction with PAR1 also plays a critical role in uncoupling activated receptor from G protein signaling (13Paing M.M. Stutts A.B. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Trejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1292-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Chen C.H. Paing M.M. Trejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10020-10031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Internalization and lysosomal sorting of activated PAR1 is another important process that mediates termination of receptor signaling. Our previous work demonstrated in fibroblasts that a PAR1 chimera containing the C-tail of the substance P receptor (P/S C-tail), a GPCR that internalizes and recycles back to the cell surface, showed enhanced and prolonged signaling after activation with thrombin (11Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 15Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This prolonged signaling was apparently due to recycling and continued signaling by receptors that returned to the cell surface with their tethered ligands intact. Thus, the C-tail of PAR1 specifies an intracellular sorting pattern that is linked to its signaling properties. In contrast to most classic GPCRs, sorting of activated PAR1 to lysosomes rather than recycling is critical for termination of receptor signaling. Activated PAR1 is internalized via a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent pathway based on our previous findings that activated PAR1 is rapidly recruited to clathrin-coated pits and internalization is blocked by dominant-negative dynamin and clathrin hub mutants (16Trejo J. Altschuler Y. Fu H.-W. Mostov K.E. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31255-31265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These observations, together with the phosphorylation dependence of PAR1 trafficking (10Shapiro M.J. Trejo J. Zeng D. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32874-32880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), raised the possibility that arrestins function in PAR1 internalization. However, we recently found that activated PAR1 is internalized through a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent pathway independent of arrestins (13Paing M.M. Stutts A.B. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Trejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1292-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking both arrestin isoforms, termination of activated PAR1 signaling is impaired; however, agonist-induced internalization and lysosomal sorting of PAR1 is unaffected. These findings indicate that activated PAR1 internalization occurs via an arrestin-independent pathway, whereas regulation of receptor G protein coupling is clearly arrestin-dependent. Although arrestins are not essential for PAR1 internalization, C-tail phosphorylation of activated receptor was still required for this process. Thus, PAR1 defines a new class of GPCRs: receptors that use a phosphorylation-, clathrin-, and dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway that is independent of arrestins. The mechanism by which activated PAR1 is recruited to clathrin-coated pits is not known. We hypothesize that PAR1 internalization through clathrin-coated pits is controlled by multiple regulatory mechanisms. The first involves phosphorylation of the C-tail that occurs at multiple alternative sites (17Hammes S.R. Shapiro M.J. Coughlin S.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2486-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), any of which is sufficient for internalization. The second involves interaction with an adaptor protein (other than arrestins) that presumably binds to a sorting sequence present in the C-tail of PAR1 and recruits the receptor to clathrin-coated pits. In the present study we examined the regulation of PAR1 trafficking by a highly conserved tyrosine-based motif localized in the C-tail region of the receptor. Our findings strongly suggest that in addition to C-tail phosphorylation, a tyrosine-based sorting signal also regulates agonist-induced PAR1 internalization. These findings reveal a novel type of mechanism by which GPCRs can internalize through clathrin-coated pits. Reagents and Antibodies—Human α-thrombin was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories. Agonist peptide SFLLRN was synthesized as the carboxyl amide and purified by reverse phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (UNC Peptide Facility, Chapel Hill, NC). Hirudin was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. [myo-3H]Inositol was purchased from American Radiolabelled Chemicals Inc. Monoclonal M1 and M2 anti-FLAG antibodies were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Rabbit anti-PAR1 polyclonal antibody was generated as previously described (18Hung D.T. Vu T.K. Wheaton V.I. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin.

PAR1 mutants were generated from full-length cDNA using QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and specific mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. A PAR1 cDNA containing the substance P receptor cytoplasmic tail (P/S C-tail) has been described previously (11Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol.

The plasmids encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged wild-type and dominant-negative (K44A) dynamin (Dyn) were kindly provided by M. A. McNiven, (Mayo Clinic and Foundation). HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HeLa cells were plated at 8 × 104, 1.5 × 105, or 2.5 × 105 cells per well of 24-, 12-, or 6-well plates, respectively, and grown overnight. Cells were then transiently transfected with a total of 0.4, 0.8, or 2 μg per well of 24-, 12-, or 6-well plates, respectively, of plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged PAR1 wild-type or mutants and either pcDNA vector, GFP-Dyn wild-type or K44A mutant using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Internalization Assays—To follow the loss of cell surface FLAG-tagged receptors, transiently transfected HeLa cells plated on fibronectin-coated 24- or 12-well culture dishes (Falcon) were incubated with or without agonist for various times at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 4 °C, washed, and then incubated with M1 anti-FLAG antibody diluted in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 for 1 h at 25 °C. Cells were washed and then incubated with either 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for an additional 1–2 h at 25 °C. In the latter case, the amount of bound horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was determined by incubation with 1-Step ABTS (2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Pierce) substrate for 10–20 min at 25 °C. An aliquot was removed, and the optical density determined at 405 nm using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax Plus microplate reader. To detect the amount of surface bound 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, cells were lysed with 1 n NaOH, and the amount of radioactivity present in lysates was determined with a γ counter. To follow the cohort of internalized receptors, HeLa cells transiently expressing similar amounts of FLAG-PAR1 wild type or mutants were incubated with the calcium-dependent M1 anti-FLAG antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Under these conditions only receptors present on the cell surface bind antibody. Cells were washed and incubated in the absence or presence of agonist for various times at 37 °C. Surface-bound antibody was then removed by three washes with PBS, Ca2+- and Mg2+-free, containing 0.04% EDTA for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were then lysed in Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3% BSA, and 1% Triton X-100), and accumulated intracellular antibody was measured by ELISA as previously described (10Shapiro M.J.

To assess recovery of internalized receptors, HeLa cells transiently expressing similar amounts of surface FLAG-tagged PAR1 wild type or mutants were incubated with M1 anti-FLAG antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed to remove unbound antibody and then incubated in the absence or presence of agonist for 90 min at 37 °C. The remaining surface-bound antibody was then removed with PBS, 0.04% EDTA, and the amount of receptor-bound antibody reappearing at the cell surface was measured by ELISA as described previously (11Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—HeLa cells plated in 6-well culture dishes (Falcon) transiently expressing FLAG-tagged PAR1 wild type or mutants were lysed in Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% Triton-X-100) containing protease inhibitors. An equivalent amount of lysates was then used for immunoprecipitation with M2 anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and immunoblotted with anti-PAR1 antibody followed by secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoblots were developed with ECL-PLUS™ (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), imaged by autoradiography, and quantitated by a BioRad Fluor-S MultiImager. Phosphoinositide Hydrolysis—HeLa cells plated in 12-well dishes transiently expressing FLAG-PAR1 wild type or mutants were labeled with 2 μCi/ml of [myo-3H]inositol in serum-free DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA overnight. Cells were washed and then incubated in the absence or presence of agonist diluted in DMEM, 1 mg/ml BSA containing 20 mm lithium chloride for various times at 37 °C. Cell incubation medium was removed, and total cellular [3H]inositol phosphates ([3H]IPs) were extracted, isolated, and quantitated as described previously (13Paing M.M. Stutts A.B. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Trejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1292-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using Prism 3.0 Software, and statistical significance was determined using InStat 3.0 (GraphPAD, San Diego, CA). Expression and Signaling of PAR1 Y383A/L386A Mutant— We previously demonstrated that activated PAR1 internalization occurs through a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent pathway that is independent of arrestins (13Paing M.M. Stutts A.B. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Trejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1292-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 16Trejo J. Altschuler Y. Fu H.-W. Mostov K.E. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31255-31265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, agonist-induced phosphorylation of PAR1 C-tail domain is necessary for internalization of the receptor, even in the absence of arrestins. Toward identifying the mechanism responsible for recruitment and internalization of activated PAR1 through clathrin-coated pits, we examined the C-tail region for conserved amino acid residues that might function as intracellular sorting signals. Amino acid sequence alignment of the PAR1 C-tail regions from all known species revealed the presence of a highly conserved tyrosine-based motif, YXXL, which localized approximately ten amino acids from the end of the seventh transmembrane domain (Fig. 1A). In contrast, examination of the C-tail region of the β2-adrenergic receptor, a GPCR that requires arrestins for internalization (20Kohout T.A. Lin F.-T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar), failed to reveal such a motif. To begin to investigate the function of these conserved residues in PAR1 trafficking we generated a mutant PAR1 in which tyrosine 383 and leucine 386 were converted to alanines (Y383A/L386A). We first determined whether PAR1 Y383A/L386A mutant was expressed at the cell surface like the wild-type receptor. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either FLAG-tagged PAR1 wild type or mutant, and surface receptor expression was assessed by ELISA. In both PAR1 wild type- and Y383A/L386A mutant-transfected cells, a similar amount of receptor was detected on the cell surface at steady state (Fig. 1B), suggesting that these mutations did not alter the amount of PAR1 surface expression. PAR1 couples to Gαq and stimulates phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis through the activation of PLC-β (21Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Thus, to ensure that mutation of tyrosine 383 and leucine 386 did not globally disrupt PAR1 signaling responses, we assessed agonist-induced PI hydrolysis. HeLa cells transiently expressing similar amounts of surface PAR1 wild type or mutant were labeled with [myo-3H]-inositol and incubated in the absence or presence of a saturating concentration of peptide agonist SFLLRN for 60 min at 37 °C. The accumulation of cellular [3H]IPs was then measured. In both PAR1 wild type- and mutant-expressing cells, agonist induced a similar ∼6-fold increase in [3H]IP accumulation compared with vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 1C). Together, these findings suggest that mutation of PAR1 C-tail residues tyrosine 383 and leucine 386 does not globally alter receptor surface expression or signaling responses. PAR1 Y383A/L386A Mutant Is Defective in Agonist-induced Degradation—Activated PAR1 is internalized, sorted predominantly to lysosomes, and rapidly degraded (11Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 16Trejo J. Altschuler Y. Fu H.-W. Mostov K.E. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31255-31265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine whether PAR1 wild type and Y383A/L386A mutant are sorted similarly to a degradative pathway upon activation, transiently transfected HeLa cells were incubated in the absence or presence of agonist for 90 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated, and the amount of PAR1 protein remaining was determined by immunoblot. In untreated control cells, analysis of immunoprecipitates from wild-type and mutant receptor lysates revealed comparable amounts of one major PAR1 transfection-dependent band migrating at ∼64 kDa (Fig. 2). Incubation with agonist peptide SFLLRN caused a significant decrease in PAR1 wild-type protein; a ∼40% decrease in receptor protein was detected compared with untreated control cells. These data suggest that upon activation, PAR1 is internalized and rapidly sorted to a degradative pathway in these cells, consistent with that previously reported (16Trejo J. Altschuler Y. Fu H.-W. Mostov K.E. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31255-31265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In striking contrast, in cells expressing the PAR1 Y383A/L386A mutant, exposure to agonist peptide had a minimal effect on receptor degradation (Fig. 2); only ∼15% decrease of mutant receptor protein was observed compared with control cells. At face value, these findings suggest that the PAR1 C-tail tyrosine 383 and leucine 386 are critical residues involved in the regulation of agonist-induced receptor trafficking. Activated PAR1 Internalization Is Regulated by a C-tail Localized YXXL Motif—To determine whether defective degradation of activated PAR1 Y383A/L386A mutant is due to inhibition of receptor internalization, we examined agonist-induced loss of mutant receptor from the cell surface. HeLa cells transiently transfected with either FLAG-PAR1 wild type or Y383A/L386A mutant were incubated with agonist peptide SFLLRN for various times at 37 °C. After incubations, cells were fixed, and the amount of PAR1 remaining on the cell surface was quantitated by ELISA and used as a measure of receptor internalization. In these experiments, the amount of PAR1 detected on the cell surface before incubation (0 min time point) was similar for each transfection condition. In cells expressing PAR1 wild type, agonist induced rapid receptor internalization within 10 min (Fig. 3A). The wild-type receptor continued to slowly internalize leading to a ∼60% loss of surface PAR1 detected after 30 min of agonist exposure (Fig. 3A). By contrast, in cells expressing PAR1 Y383A/L386A mutant, the addition of agonist caused a more modest ∼25% decrease in cell surface receptor that reached near steady state by 10 min (Fig. 3A). The concentration effect for SFLLRN at inducing PAR1 wild type and Y383A/L386A mutant internalization is consistent with a defect in agonist-induced internalization of mutant receptor (Fig. 3B). HeLa cells transiently expressing PAR1 wild type or Y383A/L396A mutant were incubated with varying concentrations of SFLLRN for 30 min at 37 °C, and the amount of receptor remaining on the cell surface was then measured. The maximal effect of 300 μm SFLLRN at inducing loss of PAR1 wild type and mutant from the cell surface was ∼60 and ∼28%, respectively. Together, these data suggest a role for the tyrosine-based motif in agonist-induced PAR1 internalization. The modest loss of agonist-induced PAR1 Y383A/L386A mutant from the cell surface appears to be caused by defective internalization. However, it is also possible that mutant PAR1 is normally internalized but recycled back to the cell surface rather than sorted to lysosomes like the wild-type receptor. To distinguish between these possibilities we followed internalization and recycling of wild type and mutant receptor bound to antibody (Fig. 4). HeLa cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged PAR1 wild type or Y383A/L386A mutant were incubated with the calcium-dependent M1-FLAG antibody for 60 min at 4 °C, then washed to remove unbound antibody, and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of agonist. After incubation, surface-bound antibody and agonist were removed by washing cells with PBS/EDTA, and the reappearance of previously internalized receptor-bound M1 FLAG antibody was followed over the next 60 min. The amount of antibody on the cell surface at various times was then quantitated by ELISA. A prolonged 90-min exposure to agonist peptide caused a substantial decrease in the amounts of surface PAR1 wild type and Y383A/L386A mutant (Fig. 4, A and B)."

To determine whether specific subtypes of intracellular phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) facilitate hormone-induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes, we examined alterations in the mRNA level, protein mass, and activity of three previously characterized mammalian intracellular PLA2s. Hormone-induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells resulted in 7.3 ± 0.5- and 7.4 ± 1.4-fold increases of mRNA encoding the calcium-independent phospholipases, iPLA2β and iPLA2γ, respectively. In contrast, the temporally coordinated loss of at least 90% of cPLA2α mRNA was manifest. Western analysis demonstrated the near absence of both iPLA2β and iPLA2γ protein mass in resting 3T3-L1 cells that increased dramatically during differentiation. In vitro measurement of PLA2 activities demonstrated an increase in both iPLA2β and iPLA2γ activities that were discriminated using the chiral mechanism based inhibitors (S)- and (R)-BEL, respectively. Remarkably, treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with small interfering RNA directed against either iPLA2β or iPLA2γ prevented hormone-induced differentiation. Moreover, analysis of the temporally programmed expression of transcription factors demonstrated that the small interfering RNA knockdown of iPLA2β or iPLA2γ resulted in down-regulation of the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα). No alterations in the expression of the early stage transcription factors C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were observed. Collectively, these results demonstrate prominent alterations in intracellular PLA2s during 3T3-L1 cell differentiation into adipocytes and identify the requirement of iPLA2β and iPLA2γ for the adipogenic program that drives resting 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes after hormone stimulation.

Increased adipose tissue mass can result from either an increase in individual adipocyte cell size (hypertrophy) or from an increase in total adipocyte number (hyperplasia). Alterations in whole organism lipid homeostasis leading to increased adipocyte tissue mass are highly correlated with the metabolic syndrome that is accompanied by its lethal sequelae of diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis (2Spiegelman B.M.

During the last decade, substantial progress has been made in understanding the biochemical events leading to adipocyte differentiation utilizing the hormone-induced 3T3-L1 cell model of adipocyte differentiation (6Moustaid N.

Central to this understanding has been the detailed characterization of temporally coordinated changes in the expression of specific genes that collectively define the adipocyte phenotype. Differentiation of adipocytes is accomplished by the programmed activation of transcriptional regulatory proteins that modulate the expression of mRNA and proteins that effectively reprogram 3T3-L1 cell lipid metabolism to that of a mature adipocyte. Such alterations include increased de novo fatty acid synthesis, accumulation of perilipin-coated triglyceride droplets, and the generation of lipid secondary messengers including eicosanoids and lysophosphatic acid that serve as potent and specific regulators of coordinated differentiation programs (3Gregoire F.M.

Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) catalyze the hydrolysis of the sn-2 fatty acid substituents from glycerophospholipid substrates to yield free fatty acid (e.g. arachidonic acid) and lysophospholipid (15Gross R.W. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1992; 2: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Gross R.W. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Miyake R. Gross R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mammalian phospholipases A2 have been categorized into several classes based on their requirement for calcium ion in in vitro activity assays (i.e. millimolar, nanomolar, or no calcium requirement) leading to their broad classification into three classes of enzymes: calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2), cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), and secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) (18Kudo I. Murakami M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68/69: 3-58Crossref Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Prior studies have demonstrated that eicosanoids are potent modulators of adipocyte differentiation underscoring the roles of PGE2 and PGI2 in inducing transformation of progenitor cells into mature adipocytes (19Vassaux G. Gaillard D. Darimont C. Ailhaud G. Negrel R. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vassaux G. Gaillard D. Ailhaud G. Negrel R. J. Biol.

Krakow S.L. Bailey S.T. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1855-1858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In most mammalian cells, the rate-determining step in the production of biologically active eicosanoids is the release of arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids. Despite the known importance of eicosanoids in modulating adipocyte differentiation, there is a paucity of information on the molecular identity of the specific types of intracellular phospholipases A2 present in differentiating adipocytes, the alterations in protein mass and activity levels of the different intracellular phospholipase A2 classes, and the importance of each specific type of phospholipase A2 in adipocyte differentiation (14Gao G.

However, there is no information presently available on the types of phospholipases A2 present in the adipocyte that contribute to eicosanoid and lysolipid production in the adipocyte. Recent analyses of the transcriptional programs utilized for adipocyte differentiation have identified the critical roles of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family and PPARγ in mediating the transcriptional alterations required for adipocyte differentiation (3Gregoire F.M.

Hormone-induced growth-arrested 3T3-L1 cells treated with insulin, methylisobutylxanthine, and dexamethasone express the early transcription factors C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, which lead to their re-entry into the cell cycle (25Tang Q.Q.

C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ then activate the transcription of C/EBPα and PPARγ, which are believed to both be antimitotic and act synergistically to activate the expression of adipocyte-specific genes leading to the differentiated adipocyte phenotype (27Altiok S.

In this study, we demonstrate the dramatic up-regulation of both iPLA2β and iPLA2γ mRNA levels, protein content, and enzymatic activities during hormone-induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells temporally coordinated with the down-regulation of cPLA2α to near background levels. Moreover, the essential roles of iPLA2β and iPLA2γ in adipocyte differentiation and their interplay with C/EBP and PPAR transcription factors have been identified by specific siRNA knockdown of either iPLA2β or iPLA2γ activity. The results demonstrate that downregulation of iPLA2β or iPLA2γ inhibits adipocyte differentiation via preventing PPARγ and C/EBPα expression without affecting the expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. Collectively, these results are the first to demonstrate the central roles of both iPLA2β and iPLA2γ in the differentiation of a mammalian preadipocyte cell line into adipocytes.

Two days after cell confluence, differentiation was initiated by adding differentiation medium 1 (0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, 1 μg/ml insulin in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum). Two days later, methylisobutylxanthine and dexamethasone were removed and insulin (1 μg/ml) was maintained for 2 more days. Thereafter, cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence of differentiating reagents by replacing the media every 2 days. Reverse Transcription and Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was purified from 3T3-L1 cell pellets utilizing a RNeasy® Mini Kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For cDNA preparation, 250 pmol of random hexamers were hybridized by incubation for 10 min at 25 °C and extended by incubation for 30 min at 48 °C in the presence of 125 units of reverse transcriptase in 100 μl of PCR buffer (5.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm of each dNTP, and 40 units of RNase inhibitor). Reverse transcriptase was inactivated by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. Amplification of each target cDNA was performed with TaqMan® PCR reagent kits and quantified by the ABI PRISM 7700 detection system according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A traditionally utilized standard gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, was measured and used as internal standard. Oligonucleotide primer pairs and probes specific for cPLA2α (5′-CCTTTGAGTTCATTTTGGATCCTAA/5′-TGTAGCTGTGCCTAGGGTTTCAT/5′-AGGAAAATGTTTTGGAGATCACACTGATGGATG), iPLA2β (5′-CCTTCCATTACGCTGTGCAA/5′-GAGTCAGCCCTTGGTTGTT/5′-CCAGGTGCTACAGCTCCTAGGAAAGAATGC), and iPLA2γ (5′-GAGGAGAAAAAGCGTGTGCTACTTC/5′-GGTTGTTCTTCTTAAGGCCTGAA/5′-TCTGTTATCAATACTCACTCTTGCAATA) were employed. Protein Extraction and Western Blot—Proteins from 3T3-L1 cells were extracted as described previously (31Gomez F.E. Miyazaki M. Kim Y.C. Marwah P. Lardy H.A. Ntambi J.M. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5473-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell monolayer was washed with ice-cold PBS and subsequently scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The solution was incubated on ice for 10 min after vortexing for 10 s. The cell homogenate was spun at 10,000 × g at 4 °C in a tabletop centrifuge for 10 min and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and stored at –70 °C until used for Western blot analysis. Nuclear extracts were prepared with NE-PER® Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents from Pierce according to manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) in 10 mm CAPS buffer (pH 11) containing 10% methanol. Powdered milk (5% (w/v)) was used to block nonspecific binding sites prior to incubation with primary antibody directed against each specific protein as indicated. After incubation with secondary antibody (IgG-HRP conjugate diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer), proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Phospholipase A2 Assays—On the day of the experiment, 3T3-L1 cells at different stages of differentiation were washed briefly with PBS and detached by incubation in trypsin-EDTA (0.25%, w/v) at 37 °C for 5 min. The cells were washed again with 5 volumes of CMRL-1066, transferred to a 50-ml Falcon centrifuge tube, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1700 rpm at 4 °C. The resulting cell pellets were resuspended in CMRL-1066 medium and centrifuged as above two more times. The cell pellets from 4 plates (10 mm diameter) were resuspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.2) and were sonicated six times for 1 s each. The tubes were placed on ice for 3 min and then re-sonicated. PLA2 assays were performed as described previously (32Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, PLA2 activity were assessed by incubating 3T3-L1 cell protein (100–200 μg) with radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine, l-α-[oleoyl-1-14C]palmitoyl-2-oleoyl (POPC, 50 mCi/mmol, 5 μm final concentration, introduced by ethanol injection (2 μl)) in assay buffer (final conditions: 100 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm EGTA, pH 7.2) at 37 °C for 30 min in a final volume of 200 μl. Reactions were quenched by addition of butanol (100 μl). 30 μlofthe organic phase of each sample were spotted on a Whatman silica plate that was developed with a nonpolar acidic mobile phase (100 ml of 70/30/1, petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid). Spots corresponding to fatty acids were scrapped into scintillation vials and radioactivity was quantified by scintillation spectrometry as described previously (32Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). BEL enantiomers were resolved by chiral high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (32Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For the inhibition assays of iPLA2 by BEL, proteins were incubated with 10 μm (R)-BEL, (S)-BEL, racemic BEL, or ethanol vehicle for 3 min at 22 °C prior to the addition of radiolabeled substrate. SiRNA Construction and Transfection—The siRNAs directed against iPLA2β and iPLA2γ were constructed employing the Silencer™ siRNA construction kit (Ambion) according to the protocol provided by manufacturer. Upon confluence, the 3T3-L1 cell media were changed to growth media without antibiotics. One to 2 days later, cells were transfected with siRNAs (20 nm) using the siPORT™ lipid transfection reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five volumes of 1.2× differentiation medium 1 without antibiotics were added 4 h after transfection and the cells were maintained at normal growing conditions and induced to differentiate as described above. Among four siRNAs for each targeting gene, the sequences specific for iPLA2β (5′-AACAGCACAGAGAAUGAGGAG-3′) and iPLA2γ (5′-AAGAUAAACAGCUUCAGGACA-3′) were selected based upon their potency to inhibit target gene expression. A scrambled siRNA was used as a negative control. Triacylglycerol Extraction and Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—After siRNA transfection, 3T3-L1 cells were grown to day 8 as described above. The cell monolayer was washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 1 ml of 50 mm LiCl. The lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh-Dyer (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar) in the presence of an internal standard (Tri17:0TAG, 200 nmol/mg of protein). Mass spectral analysis of TAG was performed by electrospray ionization utilizing a Finnigan TSQ Quantum spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) as previously described (34Han X. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 295: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Protein Extraction from White Adipose Tissue of Zucker Rats—Female obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats and lean congenic controls (5–6 weeks old) were housed and maintained with a 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod. Water and food were given ad libitum. Animals were sacrificed (asphyxiated by CO2) and inguinal fat pads (WAT) were removed, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground with a motor and pestle. To the tissue powder was added lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and the resulting mixtures were homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem apparatus. The homogenates were spun at 10,000 × g at 4 °C in a tabletop centrifuge for 10 min and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and stored at –70 °C until used for Western blot analysis. Miscellaneous—Protein concentration was determined utilizing a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. All data were normalized to protein content and are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistically significant differences between mean values were determined using unpaired Student's t tests. Alterations in the mRNA Levels of Intracellular Phospholipases A2 during Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes— Prior work has underscored the essential roles of eicosanoid metabolites and LPC-derived LPA in adipocyte differentiation (19Vassaux G.

Because these metabolites are all downstream products of PLA2 catalyzed reactions, we sought to determine the specific types and amounts of PLA2 mRNA, protein, and activity corresponding to each of the previously characterized mammalian intracellular PLA2 as a function of time after hormone-induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. In resting cells, cPLA2α mRNA was prominent, with only minimal amounts of mRNA encoding iPLA2 detectable. However, after hormone-induced differentiation, the levels of cPLA2α mRNA decreased dramatically to near background levels (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, the levels of iPLA2β and iPLA2γ mRNA increased 7.3 ± 0.5- and 7.4 ± 1.4-fold respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). Collectively, these results demonstrate the dramatic and temporally coordinated changes in the mRNA levels of each of the previously characterized mammalian intracellular PLA2 during adipocyte differentiation. Alterations of Intracellular Phospholipase A2 Protein Mass and Activity during Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes—To further substantiate the functional importance of the observed alterations in mRNA levels, Western blot analysis was performed. Western analyses demonstrated a decrease in cPLA2α protein mass to near background levels (as predicted by the decreased mass content of cPLA2α mRNA in the differentiating adipocyte) and the dramatic increases of both iPLA2β and iPLA2γ protein products (as predicted by increased mRNA levels encoding iPLA2β and iPLA2γ from quantitative PCR) (Fig. 2). The temporal course of the increased amounts of iPLA2β and iPLA2γ protein and the decreased amount of cPLA2α protein were inversely regulated. Thus, the protein mass of each intracellular PLA2 closely paralleled the intrinsic mRNA levels of each of three mammalian intracellular PLA2 (i.e. cPLA2α, iPLA2β, and iPLA2γ). Collectively, these results demonstrate the importance of transcriptional regulation in modulating reciprocal alterations in specific classes of intracellular PLA2 during adipocyte differentiation. To further investigate if alterations in the protein content of iPLA2β and iPLA2γ present during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells were paralleled by changes in their activities, phospholipase A2 activity assays were performed. During adipocyte differentiation iPLA2 activity increased ≈4-fold (Fig. 3A). As anticipated, the measured increase in iPLA2 activity was inhibited by the mechanism-based inhibitor, racemic BEL (Fig. 3B). Previously, we demonstrated that (S)-BEL was approximately 1 order of magnitude more selective for iPLA2β in comparison to iPLA2γ, whereas (R)-BEL was approximately an order of magnitude more selective for iPLA2γ (32Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The measured iPLA2 activity in 3T3-L1 adipocyte homogenate was inhibited to similar levels by either (S)-BEL or (R)-BEL (Fig. 3B) demonstrating that both iPLA2β and iPLA2γ contribute similarly to the total amounts of measured iPLA2 activity in differentiated adipocytes. Concomitant with the increase in iPLA2 activity, calcium-dependent PLA2 activity in the homogenate decreased by 90% in day 8 3T3-L1 cells (data not shown). Collectively, these results showed an increase of iPLA2 activity and a concomitant decrease of calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 activity. Pretreatment of siRNAs Targeting iPLA2β or iPLA2γ Inhibits Hormone-induced Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes— These results, in the context of prior work on the importance of eicosanoids and lysolipids in adipocyte differentiation, suggested that iPLA2 activity may be required to promote adipocyte differentiation.

The tissue degradation is mediated, in part, by enhanced proteinase expression by macrophages. It has been demonstrated recently that macrophage proteinase expression can be stimulated or inhibited by purified ECM components. However, in an intact ECM the biologically active domains of matrix components may be masked either by tertiary conformation or by complex association with other matrix molecules. In an effort to determine whether a complex ECM produced by vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) regulates macrophage degradative phenotype, we prepared insoluble SMC matrices and examined their ability to regulate proteinase expression by RAW264.7 and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. Here we demonstrate that macrophage engagement of SMC-ECM triggers PKC-dependent activation of MAPKerk1/2 leading to increased expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and prostaglandin (PG) E2 synthesis. The addition of PGE2 to macrophage cultures stimulates their expression of both urokinase-type plasminogen activator and MMP-9, and the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 blocks ECM-induced proteinase expression. Moreover, ECM-induced PGE2 and MMP-9 expression by elicited COX-2–/– macrophages is markedly reduced when compared with the response of either COX-2+/– or COX-2+/+ macrophages. These data clearly demonstrate that SMC-ECM exerts a regulatory role on the degradative phenotype of macrophages via enhanced urokinase-type plasminogen activator and MMP-9 expression, and identify COX-2 as a targetable component of the signaling pathway leading to increased proteinase expression.

In addition to the uPA/plasminogen system, macrophages express MMPs, which are associated with tissue remodeling via their ability to degrade ECM components (21Galis Z.S. Khatri J.J. Circ.

Because the regulatory domains of individual matrix components may be masked by tertiary conformation or by their association with other matrix molecules in a complex ECM, it is difficult to predict the effect that intact cell-derived ECM would have on macrophage proteinase expression. Here we have examined the effect of a complex ECM deposited in situ by vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) on proteinase expression by RAW264.7 macrophages and peritoneal macrophages. We demonstrate that uPA and MMP-9 expression by RAW264.7 macrophages and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages is triggered by contact with SMC-ECM matrix. Induction of macrophage proteinase expression was dependent on a PKC-dependent activation of MAPKerk1/2 leading to enhanced COX-2 expression and COX-dependent synthesis of PGE2. Cell Culture—Murine RAW264.7 macrophages (44Raschke W.C. Baird S. Ralph P. Nakoinz I. Cell. 1978; 15: 261-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained as adherent cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Cellect Gold fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 4 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). Experiments to determine the effect of matrix on macrophage proteinase expression were carried out in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% low endotoxin bovine serum albumin. Preparation of Extracellular Matrix-coated Dishes—Smooth muscle cell-derived matrices were prepared as described previously (12Falcone D.J. McCaffrey T.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Vergilio J.-A. Nicholson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11951-11958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (provided by Dr. T. A. McCaffrey, The George Washington University Medical Center) were plated into 6-, 12-, or 24-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Three to 4 days after reaching confluence, the cell layer was removed by sequential exposure to 0.5% Triton X-100 in DPBS (10 min at room temperature) and 0.2 mm NH4OH in DPBS (3 min at room temperature). The remaining matrices were washed three times with DPBS and stored at 4 °C. Cox-2-deficient Mice—Cox-2 heterozygote mice (B6,129-Ptgs2tm1Jed) (45Dinchuk J.E. Car B.D. Focht R.J. Johnston J.J. Jaffee B.D. Covington M.B. Contel N.R. Eng V.M. Collins R.J. Czerniak P.M. Stewart A.G. Trzaskos J.

Heterozygotes were interbred to generate Cox-2 wild type, Cox-2 heterozygote, and Cox-2 null animals. Genotypes were determined by PCR analysis of tail tip-derived genomic DNA, as described previously (46Mackrell P.J. Daly J.M. Mestre J.R. Stapleton P.P. Howe L.R. Subbaramaiah K. Dannenberg A.J.

Isolation of Peritoneal Macrophages—Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were obtained from Swiss Webster and COX-2 wild type, COX-2 heterozygote, and COX-2 null mice by the method of Edelson and Cohn (47Edelson P.J. Cohn Z.A. Bloom B.R. David J.R. In Vitro Methods in Cell-mediated Tumor Immunity. Academic Press, New York1976: 333-340Google Scholar) as described previously (9Falcone D.J. Ferenc M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 135: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mice were injected intraperitoneally (3 ml/mouse) with 3% Brewer Thioglycollate Medium containing 0.3 mm thioglycollate (Difco). Four days later cells were harvested by lavage with cold DPBS. Peritoneal cells were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in DMEM, 10% FBS, and plated into appropriate wells. Cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h and then washed free of nonadherent cells. Determination of Plasminogen Activator Activity—Plasminogen activator activity was quantitated by utilizing a sensitive functional assay for plasmin (13Falcone D.J. McCaffrey T.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Garcia M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Aliquots of conditioned media were added to microtiter wells containing 82 μl of DPBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 13 μg of the plasmin substrate d-Val-Leu-Lys-aminomethylcoumarin (Enzyme Systems Products), and 0.5 μg of bovine plasminogen (American Diagnostica). Samples were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h. Cleavage of the substrate was monitored by measuring the increase in fluorescence in a Fluoroscan microplate reader (excitation, 330–380 nm; emission, 430–530 nm). Concentrations of uPA in the test samples were extrapolated from a standard curve by utilizing high molecular weight uPA (American Diagnostica). Plasminogen activator activity in macrophage-conditioned media was completely inhibited when preincubated with a polyclonal anti-human uPA IgG (American Diagnostica). Determination of Metalloproteinase Activity—The presence of metalloproteinase activity in cellular conditioned media was determined by utilizing enzyme zymography as described previously (36Khan K.M.F. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8270-8275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Conditioned media were mixed with SDS sample buffer (without mercaptoethanol) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples and molecular weight markers were electrophoresed in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% gelatin. The gel was then washed (two times) in 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS. The gel was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h in 200 mm NaCl containing 40 mm Tris-HCl and 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The presence of gelatinolytic activity was identified as clear bands on a uniform blue background following destaining. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Macrophages were lysed in Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were centrifuged (14,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were recovered, normalized for protein, and mixed with SDS sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol and boiled 5 min. Equal amounts of cell lysates were applied to gels based on protein content. Western Blot Identification of Phosphorylated and Total MAPKerk1/2— Cell lysates were electrophoresed in 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, following which the membrane was placed in blocking buffer for 1 h. Following one wash in 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.00, containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 0.5% Tween (TTBS), the membrane was incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 75 ng/ml rabbit anti-phosphospecific p44/p42 MAPK IgG (Cell Signaling Technology). The membrane was washed (two times; TTBS) and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 0.3 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to HRP (Transduction Laboratories). The membrane was washed in TTBS (three times). Bound HRP was visualized utilizing enhanced chemiluminescence. Membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris buffer, pH 6.7, containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C, washed, and probed for total MAPKerk1/2 with 0.2 μg/ml rabbit anti-p44/p42 MAPK IgG (Cell Signaling Technology). Determination of PGE2 Levels in Macrophage-conditioned Media— The concentrations of PGE2 in conditioned media were determined by utilizing competitive enzyme immunoassay (STAT-Prostaglandin E2 EIA Kit; Cayman Chemical). Western Blot Identification of COX-1 and COX-2—Cell lysates were electrophoresed in gradient gels, and proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. Following transfer, the membrane was placed in blocking buffer for 1 h, washed in PBS (one time), and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml rabbit IgG raised against a peptide containing amino acids 584–598 of murine COX-2 or 1.0 μg/ml rabbit IgG raised against a peptide containing amino acids 274–288 of murine COX-1 (Cayman Chemical). The membrane was washed (two times; TTBS) and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 0.3 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to HRP (Transduction Laboratories). The membrane was washed in TTBS (three times). Bound HRP was visualized utilizing enhanced chemiluminescence. Western Blot Identification of Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH)—Cell lysates were electrophoresed in gradient gels, and proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. Following transfer, the membrane was placed in blocking buffer for 1 h, washed in PBS (one time), and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 8 μg/ml monoclonal anti-GAPDH IgG (Biodesign). The membrane was washed (two times; TTBS) and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 80 ng/ml rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to HRP (Pierce). The membrane was washed in TTBS (three times). Bound HRP was visualized utilizing enhanced chemiluminescence. Western Blot Identification of MMP-9—Macrophage-conditioned media were electrophoresed in gradient gels, and proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. Following transfer, the membrane was placed in blocking buffer for 1 h, washed in PBS (one time), and incubated for 2 h in blocking buffer containing rabbit anti-mouse MMP-9 IgG (Chemicon). The membranes were washed (two times; TTBS) and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 0.3 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to HRP (Bio-Rad). The membrane was washed in TTBS (three times). Bound HRP was visualized by utilizing enhanced chemiluminescence.

Consequently, the effect of a complex ECM on proteinase expression remains unclear. Therefore, we cultured macrophages on an ECM deposited in situ by cultured aortic SMC, and we determined its effect on macrophage uPA and metalloproteinase expression. As shown in Fig. 1A, uPA activity in media recovered from murine RAW264.7 macrophages cultured on ECM was 15-fold greater than that observed in media from cells cultured on plastic. Likewise, the expression of MMP-9 by RAW264.7 macrophages cultured on ECM was markedly elevated as compared with that in cells cultured on plastic. Virtually all the MMP-9 secreted by murine RAW264.7 macrophages was in the pro-form (105 kDa), which is slightly larger than that expressed by human cells (92 kDa). Neither uPA nor MMP-9 activities were stimulated when macrophages were suspended above the ECM on porous inserts or incubated with ECM-conditioned media (data not shown). To determine whether ECM regulated proteinase expression by primary macrophages, we isolated resident and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from Swiss Webster mice, and we plated them on either plastic or SMC-ECM. In contrast to RAW264.7 macrophages, an overnight incubation on ECM did not stimulate uPA expression by resident macrophages, although MMP-9 expression was strongly stimulated (Fig. 1B). As expected, conditioned media derived from thioglycollate-elicited macrophages contained increased levels of uPA, MMP-9, and MMP-2 relative to resident cells (9Falcone D.J. Ferenc M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 135: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 43Khan K.M.F. Laurie G.W. McCaffrey T.A. Falcone D.J. J. Biol.

Med. 1974; 139: 834-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). When elicited macrophages were cultured on ECM, their expression of uPA and MMP-9 activities was further increased. Thus, proteinase expression by macrophages is stimulated by their engagement of a complex ECM deposited in situ. ECM-induced Proteinase Expression by Macrophages Requires Protein Kinase C-dependent Activation of MAPKerk1/2— Monocyte/macrophage adherence to purified ECM components triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including MAPKerk1/2 and subsequent induction of gene expression (49Lin T.H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13778-13786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the induction of macrophage proteinase expression by synthetic laminin α1-chain peptides was mediated by protein kinase C-dependent activation of MAPKerk1/2. Therefore, we determined whether the stimulation of uPA and MMP-9 expression by SMC-ECM was dependent on a similar pathway. As shown in Fig. 2A, the adhesion of RAW264.7 macrophages to ECM triggered a rapid and persistent phosphorylation of MAPKerk1/2. Equal protein loading was confirmed by stripping and probing for total MAPKerk1/2. The observed activation of MAPKerk1/2 was not simply because of adhesion, because levels of phosphorylated MAPKerk1/2 are elevated in cells cultured on ECM versus plastic (Fig. 2B). Pre-incubation of cells with an inhibitor of either MEK-1 (U0126) or protein kinase C (calphostin C) blocked ECM-induced phosphorylation of MAPKerk1/2 without affecting levels of total MAPKerk1/2 in cell lysates (Fig. 2B). Moreover, ECM-induced uPA and MMP-9 expressions were blocked in RAW264.7 cells treated with either U0126 or calphostin C (Fig. 2, C and D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that engagement of SMC-ECM up-regulates macrophage uPA and MMP-9 expression and confirms the causal role for protein kinase C-dependent activation of MAPKerk1/2 in ECM-induced proteinase expression. ECM-induced Proteinase Expression by Macrophages Is Cyclooxygenase-dependent—Activated MAPKerk1/2 triggers a diverse set of cellular responses by phosphorylating (and activating) transcription factors and other serine threonine kinases (53Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 148-180Crossref Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). In addition, MAPKerk1/2 phosphorylates phospholipase A2 leading to an increase in prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandin (PG) E2, an important mediator of the inflammatory response, stimulates proteinase expression by a variety of cell types including monocytes (35Shankavaram U.T. DeWitt D.L. Funk S.E.

Previous studies have revealed that DGK consists of a family of isozymes including our rat clones. In this study we isolated from rat brain cDNA library the cDNA clones for a rat homologue of DGKι (rDGKι-1) that contains two zinc finger-like sequences, the highly conserved DGK catalytic domain, a bipartite nuclear localization signal, and four ankyrin repeats at the carboxyl terminus. In addition, we found novel splice variants, which contain either insertion 1 (71 bp) or insertion 2 (19 bp) or both in the carboxyl-terminal portion. Each of the insertions causes a frameshift, and the resultant premature stop codons produce two truncated forms (termed rDGKι-2 and -ι-3), the former lacking the ankyrin repeats at the carboxyl terminus and the latter lacking a part of the catalytic domain and the ankyrin repeats. Truncation of the carboxyl-terminal portion clearly exerts effects on the detergent solubility and enzymatic activity of the splice variants, although all three variants showed similar cytoplasmic localization in cDNA-transfected cultured neurons despite the continued presence of the nuclear localization signal sequence. Immunoblot analysis using anti-rDGKι antibody raised against the common amino-terminal portion clearly shows that these rDGKι variants are indeed expressed in the brain. These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of rDGKι-2 and -ι-3 that exhibit reduced enzymatic activities might show a dominant negative effect against the intact rDGKι-1, and that the modulation of signal transduction by the splice variants may play some roles in the physiologic and/or pathologic conditions of neurons.

Extracellular signals, such as growth factors and neurotransmitters, trigger cascades of molecular changes at the plasma membrane, and many of them evoke a transient increase in levels of cellular diacylglycerol (DG) 1The abbreviations used are: DG, diacylglycerol; NLS, nuclear localization signal; DGK, diacylglycerol kinase; r, rat; h, human; PA, phosphatidic acid; PKC, protein kinase C; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CDK6, cyclin-dependent kinase 6.1The abbreviations used are: DG, diacylglycerol; NLS, nuclear localization signal; DGK, diacylglycerol kinase; r, rat; h, human; PA, phosphatidic acid; PKC, protein kinase C; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CDK6, cyclin-dependent kinase 6. through hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C (1Rhee S.G. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). This rapid rise in cellular DG results in allosteric activation of protein kinase C (PKC), which mediates many cellular responses through phosphorylation of target proteins (2Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5757) Google Scholar). Prolonged and excessive activation of PKC stimulated by protooncogene-related cascade leads to pathological conditions, which is commonly seen in transformed cells (2Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5757) Google Scholar). This is supported by the fact that phorbol esters, which substitute for DG as signal mediators, serve as potent tumor promoters by persistently activating PKC (3Kazanietz M.G. Bustelo X.R.

The functional significance of DG is not restricted to the PKC pathway; recently there has been evidence indicating that DG also activates several proteins including RasGRP (4Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A.

Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar), suggesting that DG is implicated in cellular events more widely than previously thought. Therefore, DG level must be strictly controlled to maintain the normal state. Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), which catalyzes phosphorylation of DG to phosphatidic acid (PA), is thought to be a key enzyme in the regulation of DG levels and, as a result, to be responsible for attenuating the activation of PKC (8Kanoh H. Yamada K. Sakane F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 47-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PA, the product of DGK, may also serve as a lipid second messenger, which has been reported to regulate a growing list of signaling proteins, including PKC-ζ (9Limatola C. Schaap D. Moolenaar W.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate kinase (10Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phospholipase C-γ1 (11Jones G.A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20845-20850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and many other molecules. Recently it was shown that PA directly interacts with the mammalian target of rapamycin, which governs cell growth and proliferation by mediating the mitogen- and nutrient-dependent signal transduction that regulates messenger RNA translation in a variety of cells (12Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Thus, DGK is thought to be one of the key enzymes closely involved in the lipid-mediated cellular signaling events. Because 80-kDa DGK was first purified and cloned from porcine brain and thymus cytosol (13Kanoh H. Kondoh H. Ono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1767-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Nature. 1990; 344: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), many DGK isozymes have been isolated from various animal sources (reviewed in Refs. 15Sakane F. Kanoh H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Goto K. Kondo H. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). These isozymes have been described to differ from each other with respect to the molecular masses, enzymological properties, activators, and substrate specificities. It is thus likely that these isozymes are operated under distinct regulatory mechanisms. Among these, DGKι was initially isolated from the human cDNA library and revealed to belong to class IV of the DGK family because it contains four ankyrin repeats at its carboxyl terminus similar to DGKζ (18Ding L.

This isozyme was expressed only in the brain and retina in human tissues and was found to be in both the cytoplasm and nucleus by immunoblot analysis of the cDNA-transfected COS-7 cells (18Ding L.

In this study we isolated cDNA clones for a rat homologue of DGKι (rDGKι-1) that contains two zinc finger-like sequences, the highly conserved DGK catalytic domain, a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS), and four ankyrin repeats at the carboxyl terminus. Furthermore, we found novel splice variants, which contain either the insertion 1 (71 bp) or the insertion 2 (19 bp) or both in the carboxyl-terminal portion. Each of the insertions causes a frameshift, and the resultant premature stop codons produce two truncated forms (termed rDGKι-2 and -ι-3), the former lacking the ankyrin repeats at the carboxyl terminus and the latter lacking a part of the catalytic domain in addition to the ankyrin repeats. Characterization of these variants with respect to the primary structure, detergent solubility, catalytic activity, and subcellular localization, together with the immunoblot data on the endogenous enzymes of the brain, suggests that the carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of rDGKι-2 and -ι-3 that exhibit reduced enzymatic activities might show a dominant negative effect against the intact rDGKι-1. cDNA Cloning—An oligo(dT)-primed λgt10 adult rat brain cDNA library (6 × 105 clones) was screened with mixed cDNA probes encoding the highly homologous catalytic regions of rat DGKα, -β, -γ, and -ζ under low stringency hybridization: 30% formamide, 5× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate), 1× Denhardt's solution, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 0.5 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C (19Goto K.

One positive clone, pRMI, was obtained that was different from those of the previously cloned rat DGK isozymes but partly homologous to them. We obtained several other clones of different length by the second round screening using a fragment of pRMI as a probe under high stringency hybridization at 42 °C in the same solution described above, except 50% formamide was used instead of 30%. Sequencing was performed on both strands by the PerkinElmer Life Sciences 310 DNA autosequencer. Rat Brain cDNA Library Synthesis and 5′-RACE-PCR—Rat brain mRNA (3 μg) was used to generate double-stranded cDNA using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The cDNA was ligated with the Marathon cDNA adaptor. 5′-RACE was performed using the cDNA as a template with rDGKι gene-specific antisense primer RMI-1 (5′-TCTCTCCACATGGAGGTTCCAGCG-3′) and the adaptor primer AP1 or AP2 of the kit. Additional gene-specific antisense primers, RMI-2 (5′-GTCCCGTCTTCCACCTGGCACAGG-3′), RMI-3 (5′-CGGGACAATAACAGCAGCATGAGC-3′), RMI-4 (5′-TGTGATGCAGCATGAAGCAGGTCA-3′), RMI-5 (5′-TGTGCAGGAGCCAGATGCTGGAGG-3′), RMI-7 (5′-GTTAAGTCCCTCAGCTTCTCCTCC-3′), RMI-8 (5′-GCGGAAGAAGCCGAGGCGGT-3′), and RMI-9 (5′-GTCCCGTCTTCCACCTGGCACAGG-3′) were generated based on the sequences of progressively amplified 5′-RACE products. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from several tissues of adult Wistar rats as described previously (19Goto K. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yuasa H. Sakane F. Kanoh H. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 21Goto K.

A. 1996; 93: 11196-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Each of the total RNA samples (20 μg per lane) was denatured with formaldehyde and size-separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The RNA was transferred and fixed to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with a 0.7-kb probe containing a3′-noncoding sequence (nucleotides 3064–3793, GenBank™ accession number AB058962) labeled with [α-32P]dATP. Conditions for hybridization and washing were as described previously (21Goto K. Funayama M. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13042-13046Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11196-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In Situ Hybridization Histochemistry—The experiments using rats were performed according to the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals of Yamagata University. Fresh frozen blocks of brains from adult male rats were sectioned at a 30-μm thickness on a cryostat. The sections were mounted on silane-coated glass slides, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and pretreated as described previously (19Goto K. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yuasa H. Sakane F. Kanoh H. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The slides were prehybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide, 4× SSC, 1× Denhardt's, 1% sarcosyl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 μg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA for 2 h at room temperature. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a moist chamber in the same solution (50 μl/slide), which contained an additional 10% dextran sulfate and 0.5–1.0 × 106 cpm of the same cDNA probe as used for Northern analysis labeled with [α-35S]dATP by nick translation or the same amount of a control probe (pBR322, the plasmid vector). After hybridization the slides were sequentially rinsed in 2× SSC, 0.1% sarcosyl at room temperature for 30 min, three times in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% sarcosyl at 42 °C for 40 min each, and dehydrated in 70 and 100% ethanol. The sections were exposed to Hyperfilm-βmax (Amersham Biosciences) for 2–3 weeks, then dipped in Kodak NTB2 emulsion, and exposed for 2 months. COS-7 Cell Transfection, Immunoblot, and DGK Activity Assay—The cDNAs for the entire length of three rDGKι variants were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with an epitope tag composed of eight amino acids (FLAG marker peptide, Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys, by Eastman Kodak Co.) at the 5′ end of the coding region of the cDNAs. COS-7 transfection (4 μg of plasmid per 10-cm dish) was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), and all steps were according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. After incubating for 2–3 days, cDNA-transfected COS-7 cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. After a low speed centrifugation (550 × g) for 5 min, protein concentration was determined using BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Samples from transfected COS-7 cells (20 μg per lane) were subjected to SDS-10% PAGE. The proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) specific for the FLAG marker peptide. The immunoreactive band was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For assaying DGK enzymatic activity, the amounts of the expressed proteins (rDGKι-1, -ι-2, and -ι-3) were equalized by means of densitometric indication of the immunoreactive bands, and the protein concentrations were also adjusted. An equal amount of each lysate was used to measure DGK activity by the octyl glucoside mixed micelle assay as described previously (20Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Sakane F. Yamada K. Imai S. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7096-7100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 50 mm octyl glucoside, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaF, 5 mm phosphatidylserine (15.6 mol %) (Sigma), 2 mm 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol (6.25 mol %)(18:1/18:1 DG, Sigma), and 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (10,000 cpm/nmol; ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa CA). In some experiments, 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycerol (18:0/18:2 DG, Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (18:0/20:4 DG, Biomol) were also used as substrates. The reaction was initiated by adding lysate (10 μl) and continued for 3 min at 30 °C. Lipids were extracted from the mixture, and phosphatidic acid separated by thin layer chromatography was scraped and counted by liquid scintillation as described previously (20Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Sakane F. Yamada K. Imai S. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7096-7100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Fractionation—Transfected COS-7 cells were disrupted by sonication in lysis buffer as described above. Cell debris was removed by a centrifugation (550 × g, 10 min). The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate soluble (supernatant) from particulate (pellet) fractions consisting of membranes and cytoskeleton. The pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of Triton X-100 (1%)-containing lysis buffer described above and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 30 min). Resultant pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of the same buffer and was used as Triton-insoluble particulate fraction. The supernatant contained dissolved membranes, and the pellet contained the cytoskeleton (24Houssa B. de Widt J. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6820-6822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Subcellular Localization in the cDNA-transfected Cultured Neurons—Hippocampal neurons were isolated from newborn rats at postnatal day (P0) and cultured in B27-supplemented NEUROBASAL™ (Invitrogen) containing 0.5 mm glutamic acid (25Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged rDGKι variants and rDGKζ were expressed in cultured hippocampal neuronal cells by calcium phosphate transfection (Clontech). After 24 h, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody M2. Sites of antigen-antibody reaction were visualized using the biotinylated secondary antibody and streptavidin-Alexa 488 Fluor conjugates (Molecular Probes). FLAG-tagged rDGKs were photographed with a Leica fluorescent microscope and a confocal laser-scanning microscope (model TCS 4D, Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). Expression Ratio of the Splice Variants—Two primer pairs, PS1(5′-GAATCCCGAGAAGCAAATCCAGAG-3′)-PA1(5′-CCAAGGCATGGTGCCAGCACAATA-3′) and PS2(5′-TGTCCCCACGGTGGTGCTTCCTAGA-3′)-PA2(5′-GCGGAAGAAGCCGAGGCGGT-3′), were designed to bracket insertion 1 and insertion 2, respectively. PCR amplification was carried out for 30 cycles according to the following schedule: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, followed by further incubation for 7 min at 72 °C. PCR product of rat brain cDNA with PS1 and PA2 primers spanning both insertions was gel-purified and ligated with pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). A hundred clones were examined for the existence of each insertion with direct PCR using two primer pairs PS1-PA1 and PS2-PA2. Antibody Production and Immunoblot Analysis of Endogenous Rat Brain Enzymes—The cDNA fragment encoding the amino-terminal region of rDGKι (amino acids 1–157) was cloned into the glutathione S-transferase fusion expression vector, pGEX4T-1. This plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and induced for 3 h in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After sonication, the expressed fusion protein recovered in the 100,000 × g supernatant fraction was purified by glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer, and was used as an antigen. Rabbits were immunized by subcutaneous multiple injections of 400 μg of the fusion protein emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant, and the serum obtained after the fifth injection was used for antibody. Rat brain was homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science). After removal of undisrupted cells by a low speed centrifugation (550 × g, 10 min), the homogenate (30 μg) was subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-rDGKι antibody. The immunoreactive band was detected as described above. Isolation of cDNA Encoding Rat DGKι—We first screened the rat brain cDNA library by low stringency hybridization with labeled cDNA fragments of rat DGK isozymes, and we obtained a cDNA clone encoding a putative DGK. Second round screening with the cloned fragment gave us the other cDNA clones of different lengths. Subsequently, the full-length sequence was obtained by using 5′-RACE. The composite cDNA contained a 3153-nucleotide open reading frame and an inframe stop codon 150 bp upstream from the ATG site (Fig. 1). The deduced amino acid sequence encoded a protein of 1050 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 115 kDa, which was 60% identical in amino acid sequences to rDGKζ. Because data base search revealed it to be 91% identical to human DGKι (hDGKι) (18Ding L. Traer E. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32746-32752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we regarded this to be a rat homologue of the human enzyme. Like rDGKζ (22Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11196-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and hDGKι (18Ding L. Traer E. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32746-32752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), rat DGKι (rDGKι) contained the conserved cysteine-rich, zinc finger-like sequences near the amino terminus and four ankyrin repeats at the carboxyl terminus, in addition to the typical DGK catalytic domain, but lacked the EF-hand motifs. All of the structural features in rDGKι were characteristic of the class IV enzyme. NLS of a bipartite type was also included in rDGKι, as in rDGKζ, which contains two clusters of basic amino acids, residues 323–324 (KK) and residues 335–338 (KKKR), located next to the second zinc finger-like sequences (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the amino acid residues (-ETAV) at the carboxyl-terminal end of rDGKι were consistent with the class I PDZ domain ligand consensus ((S/T)XV) that is also found at the carboxyl-terminal end of DGKζ (26Hogan A. Shepherd L. Chabot J. Quenneville S. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26526-26533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A comparison of the primary structure between rDGKι and rDGKζ showed high identity in catalytic domain (81%) but relatively low identities in the amino (28%) and carboxyl termini containing four ankyrin repeats (44%) (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Comparison of the primary structure of rat DGKι and DGKζ. The cysteine-rich zinc finger-like sequences, NLS, catalytic domain, and four ankyrin repeats are depicted. The identity of each domain is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Tissue Distribution and mRNA Localization in the Brain—In Northern blot analysis, rDGKι mRNA was detected exclusively in the brain and eye among the 11 tissues examined as a major band of 3.3 kb and a weak band of about 9.6 kb. The testis contained a short species of 1.2 kb, instead of those two bands, which was of unknown origin (Fig. 3A). Such a confined distribution pattern was quite different from that of rDGKζ, which is widely and abundantly expressed throughout the body (22Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11196-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This pattern of expression suggests some neuron-specific function for rDGKι. We then examined mRNA localization in adult rat brain. By in situ hybridization analysis, intense hybridization signals for rDGKι were detected in the hippocampus, cerebellar cortex, olfactory bulb, and olfactory tubercle. Moderate signals were detected in the cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, and thalamus (Fig. 3B). No hybridization signals were detected in the white matter, such as the corpus callosum and cerebellar medulla. In a control experiment, brain sections were hybridized with plasmid vectors of appropriate length or treated with RNase A before hybridization. In either case, no significant signals were detected in any brain regions (data not shown). Alternative Splicing—In addition to the full-length rDGKι, we found novel splice variants in rat brain, presumably produced by alternative splicing mechanism. A comparison of the sequences between several rat clones and the human full-length clone revealed two additional insertions, insertion 1 (71 bp) and insertion 2 (19 bp), in the rDGKι cDNA (Fig. 4A). Because the nucleotide numbers of the insertions are not divisible by 3, the frameshift was presumed to occur in the coding sequences in association with premature stop codon in each case (Fig. 4B), resulting in generation of two putative alternatively spliced variants, termed rDGKι-2 and -ι-3, in addition to the intact rDGKι-1. The cDNA for rDGKι-2 contained insertion 2 and that for rDGKι-3 contained insertion 1, whereas the cDNA for rDGKι-1 contained no insertions. Primary structures for rDGKι-2 and -ι-3 represent truncated forms of rDGKι without ankyrin repeats, and in addition rDGKι-3 contained an incomplete catalytic domain (Fig. 4C). A series of reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments using primer sets (PS1-PA1 or PS2-PA2) spanning each of the two putative alternatively spliced regions (insertions 1 and 2) confirmed the existence of these alternative splicing events. These experiments were carried out on different rat brain cDNA libraries prepared from discrete rat brains (Fig. 4A). We next investigated the relative expression ratio of these variants in adult rat brain. For this purpose, PCR products using PS1 and PA2 primers spanning both insertions and cDNA library of normal adult rat brain as a template were subcloned and checked whether they include the insertion(s). Among 100 clones examined, the numbers of rDGKι-1, -ι-2, and -ι-3 were 53, 5, and 42, respectively. These data suggest that rDGKι-1 and -ι-3 represent the major variants for rDGKι in the adult rat brain (Table I).Table IThe expression ratio of rDGKι splice variants in the adult rat brain A hundred subclones of PCR products, amplified using PS1 and PA2 primers spanning both insertions 1 and 2 in Fig. 4 and the adult rat brain cDNA library as a template, were examined for the presence or absence of each insertion. Note that rDGKι-1 and rDGKι-3 are the comparable major variants, whereas rDGKι-2 is a minor one in the adult rat brain.Insertion 1Insertion 2Splice variantAmino acidsMassNo. clones/100 colonieskDa--rDGKι-1105011553-+rDGKι-2840935+-rDGKι-3591645/42++rDGKι-35916437/42 Open table in a new tab Characterization of rDGKι Variants—We characterized features of rDGKι variants in terms of the enzymatic activity and detergent solubility by using the mammalian expression system with the FLAG epitope tag.

Most reported inteins have a C-terminal asparagine residue, and it has been shown that cyclization of this residue is coupled to peptide bond cleavage between the intein and C-extein. We show that the intein interrupting the DNA polymerase II DP2 subunit in Pyrococcus abyssi, which has a C-terminal glutamine, is capable of facilitating protein splicing. Substitution of an asparagine for the C-terminal glutamine moderately improves the rate and extent of protein splicing. However, substitution of an alanine for the penultimate histidine residue, with either asparagine or glutamine in the C-terminal position, prevents protein splicing and facilitates cleavage at the intein N terminus. The intein facilitates in vitro protein splicing only at temperatures above 30 °C and can be purified as a nonspliced precursor. This temperature dependence has enabled us to characterize the optimal in vitro splicing conditions and determine the rate constants for splicing as a function of temperature.

This temperature dependence has enabled us to characterize the optimal in vitro splicing conditions and determine the rate constants for splicing as a function of temperature. Protein splicing is a post-translational auto-processing event by which an intervening polypeptide sequence, the intein, facilitates both its own excision from the flanking polypeptides, or exteins, as well as the ligation of the these segments (reviewed in Ref. 1Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). All of the catalytic groups required for protein splicing have been shown to lie within the intein and the two flanking amino acids (1Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The splicing mechanism of the majority of inteins has been described in detail (1Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The first step of splicing involves an N-O or N-S acyl rearrangement of the peptide bond at the intein N terminus to an ester or thioester (Fig. 1, step A). The second step is a transesterification between the nucleophilic residue at the N terminus of the C-extein 1The abbreviations used are: C-extein, C-terminal extein; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; Bis-Tris Propane, 1,3-bis-[tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamine] propane; CIV, Chilo iridescent virus; MBP, E. coli maltose-binding protein; H, the six N-terminal residues of the P. abyssi PolII C-extein fused to a C-terminal His tag; I, the Pab PolII intein; M, N-terminal extein containing N-terminal MBP, a spacer, and the seven C-terminal residues of the Pab PolII N-extein; N-extein, N-terminal extein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PolII, DNA polymerase II. The nomenclature of P. abyssi PolII intein mutants is listed schematically in Fig 2B. (Cys, Ser, or Thr) and the newly formed ester or thioester at the intein N terminus (Fig. 1, step B). Next, cyclization of the asparagine residue at the C terminus of the intein results in peptide bond cleavage and excision of the intein. Evidence in support of this step includes the isolation and analysis of C-terminal aminosuccinimide residues formed during protein splicing mediated by the Pyrococcus sp. GB-D Pol intein (2Xu M.-Q.

In addition, branched intermediate accumulates when the conserved C-terminal Asn is mutated to Gln or Asp in the Pyrococcus sp. GB-D Pol intein (5Xu M.-Q. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5146-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and splicing is prevented by these mutations in the S. cerevisiae VMA intein (6Cooper A.A. Chen Y.-J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Finally, the ester or thioester linking the extein segment is rearranged to a peptide bond (Fig. 1, step G), and the intein C-terminal aminosuccinimide residue may be hydrolyzed.Fig. 2Analysis of fusion proteins. A, purification of fusion proteins. Fusion proteins were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Approximately 0.7 μg of each protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE as described and stained with Coomassie Blue. B, amino acid sequence at C-terminal splice junction. Amino acid sequence of PolWT is consistent with the native intein sequence. Other proteins have identical amino acid sequences to PolWT except for mutations at C-terminal splice junction indicated in the sequence alignment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Inteins that follow alternate splicing mechanisms have recently been described. For example, inteins lacking an N-terminal nucleophile, in which Ala replaces the Cys or Ser at the intein N terminus, can facilitate splicing (7Southworth M.W. Benner J. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5019-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Yamamoto K. Low B. Rutherford S.A. Rajagopalan M. Madiraju M.V.V.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 898-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These inteins likely bypass the first step of splicing, although at least one has been shown to be capable of facilitating an N-S acyl rearrangement of the peptide bond linking the N-extein and the intein when the Ala at the intein N terminus is replaced with Cys (7Southworth M.W. Benner J. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5019-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). There are also examples of variations of the third step of protein splicing, in which Asn cyclization is coupled to peptide bond cleavage. It was reported that a Gln replaces the highly conserved C-terminal Asn in the intein that interrupts the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) of the Chilo iridescent virus (CIV) (9Pietrokovski S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R634-R635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This intein has been shown to be capable of facilitating protein splicing in Escherichia coli (10Amitai G. Dassa B. Pietrokovski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3121-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The intein that interrupts the RNR of Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformus has an aspartic acid residue at its C terminus and is also splicing-competent (10Amitai G. Dassa B. Pietrokovski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3121-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, the C. hydrogenoformus RNR intein is capable of facilitating cleavage at the intein C terminus, even when the C-terminal residue is mutated to Ala, suggesting an alternate mechanism to side chain cyclization for C-terminal cleavage (10Amitai G. Dassa B. Pietrokovski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3121-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the conserved penultimate His residue plays a role in Asn cyclization. Protein splicing is arrested, and branched intermediate accumulates when the penultimate His in the Pyrococcus sp. GB-D Pol intein is mutated to Ala (5Xu M.-Q. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5146-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Protein splicing can be enhanced in inteins lacking a penultimate His by introducing a His via mutation (11Wang S. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11869-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Chen L. Benner J. Perler F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20431-20435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Structural evidence also points to a role for the penultimate His in Asn cyclization. For instance, in the Mycobacterium xenopi GyrA intein crystal structure, His-197 is in a position to serve as a proton donor to the backbone amide nitrogen of the scissile bond (13Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 DnaB intein crystal structure, the penultimate His serves as a proton donor to the carbonyl oxygen of the terminal Asn (14Ding Y. Xu M.-Q. Ghosh I. Chen X. Ferrandon S. Lesage G. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39133-39142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the conserved penultimate His is not required to mediate efficient protein splicing in other inteins, because some inteins splice in its absence (7Southworth M.W. Benner J. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5019-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Chen L. Benner J. Perler F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20431-20435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Wu H. Hu Z. Liu X.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and in some of these cases splicing is impaired when the penultimate residue is replaced with His (7Southworth M.W. Benner J. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5019-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Chen L. Benner J. Perler F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20431-20435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the temperature-dependent protein splicing of the intein interrupting the DNA polymerase II, DP2 subunit in Pyrococcus abyssi. The P. abyssi PolII intein is the second intein described that can facilitate protein splicing with a C-terminal glutamine residue. Because this intein can be purified as an unspliced precursor and induced to splice via an increase in temperature, we were able to compare the in vitro protein splicing rate and the efficiency of the intein with a series of C-terminal mutations. P. abyssi Growth—A culture of P. abyssi was kindly provided by Prof. Frank Robb (Center for Marine Biotechnology, University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute). A 2% innoculum was transferred to P. abyssi medium and incubated under nitrogen at 95 °C for 14 h. Sulfur was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g in a Beckman J2–21 centrifuge for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube, and the cells were pelleted at 5000 × g for 20 min. P. abyssi medium was prepared essentially as described (16Childers S.E. Vargas M. Noll K.M. Appl. Envir. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 3949-3953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and consisted of 0.25 g/liter NH4Cl, 0.05 g/liter CaCl2, 0.05 g/liter Na2HPO4, 5 g/liter KCl, 3.45 g/liter MgSO4, 6 g/liter piperazine-1,4-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid), 20 g/liter NaCl, 0.5 g/liter cysteine, 0.5 g/liter cysteine, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 100 mg/liter pyridoxine HCl, 50 mg/liter calcium pantothenate, 50 mg/liter nicotinic acid, 50 mg/liter p-aminobenzoic acid, 50 mg/liter riboflavin, 50 mg/liter thiamin HCl, 50 mg/liter thioctic acid, 20 mg/liter folic acid, 20 mg/liter biotin, 1 mg/liter cyanocobalamine, and, after adjustment to pH 7.4 at 96 °C, 1 ml of 0.1% resazurin and about 20 g/liter of precipitated sulfur. The medium was steamed repeatedly in autoclave until yellow and transferred to capped serum bottles. Head gas was exchanged with nitrogen five to six times. DNA Purification—The P. abyssi cell pellet was washed and resuspended in 10 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). After the addition of 0.5 ml of 10% SDS and 50 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K, the cell suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. This was followed by the addition of 1.4 ml of 5 m NaCl and 1.5 ml of 10% hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide in 0.7 m NaCl and incubation for 2 min at 65 °C. DNA was extracted first with 24:1 chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and then with 1:1 phenol:chloroform. To precipitate the DNA, 0.6 volumes of isopropanol were added, and the sample was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the DNA, let air dry, and resuspended in 100 μl of deionized water. Plasmid Preparation—Plasmid pPabPol1 encodes PabPol1, an inframe fusion of E. coli MBP with the seven C-terminal residues of the P. abyssi PolII N-extein and the first 179 residues of the intein. To create this plasmid, the intein gene was amplified from genomic DNA via PCR using oligonucleotide primers P1U (5′-TACGCTAGGCCTTACATGCATGCT) and P1L (5′-TTGATGCGTTAGAATATTTTCATTTAT). (All of the oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech, High Point, NC.) The PCR product was digested with StuI and XmnI and ligated into the XmnI site of plasmid pMal-c2x (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to give plasmid pPabPol1. To introduce a C-terminal poly-His tag as the C-extein, plasmid pPabPol1His was constructed. Plasmid pPabPol1His encodes PabPol1His, an in-frame fusion of E. coli MBP with the seven C-terminal residues of the P. abyssi Pol II N-extein and the first 179 residues of the intein, fused to the C-terminal sequence K-F-Q-N-S-I-D-E-D-H-H-H-H-H-H. pPabPol1His was constructed by digesting pPabPol1 with EcoRI and HindIII and inserting the oligonucleotide pair PABUH (5′-AATTCTATCGATGAAGACCACCACCACCACCACCACTGA) and PABLH (5′-AGCTTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTCTTCATCGATAG). Plasmid pPolWT was constructed to complete the intein sequence. pPolWT encodes PolWT, an in-frame fusion of E. coli MBP with the seven C-terminal residues of the P. abyssi Pol II N-extein and the 185 residues of the intein, fused to the C-terminal sequence C-D-G-D-E-D-H-H-H-H-H-H. It was constructed by digesting pPabPol1His with XmnI and ClaI and ligating it with the oligonucleotide pair PabUWT (5′-TATTGTAACGCATCAATGTGATGG) and PabLWT (5′-CGCCATCACATTGATGCGTTACAATA). To generate mutations of pPolWT, plasmid pPabPol1His was digested with XmnI and ClaI and ligated with appropriate oligonucleotides as above to generate pPolQN, pPolHA, pPolQNHA, and pPolCA, which encode PolQN, PolHA, PolQNHA, and PolCA, respectively (Fig. 2B). The DNA sequence of all plasmids was verified by sequencing at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (Nucleic Acids Facility, Worcester, MA). The DNA sequence of the intein was consistent with that in the NCBI data base (accession number E75199). Protein Expression and Purification—Plasmid-encoded proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21DE3 (Novagen, Madison, WI). The cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking to a culture density (A600) of about 0.7 and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.4 mm) at 22 °C overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Bis-Tris Propane, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl) supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 12 units/ml benzonase nuclease (Novagen), 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride HCl, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 0.05 mm bestatin, 0.015 mm E-64, 0.02 mm leupeptin hemisulfate, and 0.01 mm pepstatin A (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The cell resuspensions were disrupted by passage through a French Pressure cell and centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The resulting lysates were each added to 1 ml of Talon metal affinity resin (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), pre-equilibrated with Buffer A, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with shaking. The resin was collected by centrifugation and washed batch-wise with 2 × 10 ml of Buffer A. The resin was transferred to a gravity flow column and washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A and 10 column volumes of Buffer A supplemented with 10 mm imidazole. The proteins were eluted in 500-μl fractions with Buffer A supplemented with 100 mm imidazole (Buffer AI). The concentration of protein in each fraction was estimated by the Bradford method (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Protein Splicing Conditions—Except where indicated, the proteins in Buffer AI were supplemented with 2.0 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 10 mm EDTA, and 136 mm Bis-Tris Propane, pH 7.5 (which resulted in a final pH value of 7.8), and reactions were initiated by incubation at indicated temperatures. Splicing and/or cleavage reactions were terminated by the addition of New England Biolabs 3× SDS-PAGE buffer supplemented with dl-1,4-dithiothreitol. For determination of the pH dependence of protein reactions, the proteins were also supplemented with 136 mm Bis-Tris Propane at pH 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, or 8.0. The pH values of the final protein mixtures were determined experimentally and indicated below. All of the pH values were as measured at 23 °C. Protein Analysis—The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and high resolution mass spectrometry. For SDS-PAGE, precast 4–20% gradient, Tris-Glycine iGels (Gradipore, Frenchs Forest, Australia) were used via the Laemmli method (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The samples were mixed with 3× SDS Sample buffer (New England Biolabs) supplemented with 40 μm dl-1,4-dithiothreitol and boiled for 3 min before loading, along with broad range and prestained broad range protein markers (New England Biolabs). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For Western blots, the gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose at 100 V for 1 h. The blots were incubated for 30 min in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and then with 2 μg/ml His tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen) in PBS for 1 h, washed with 50 ml of PBS three times for 20 min, incubated with 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Novagen), and then washed again with 50 ml of PBS three times for 20 min. The blots were developed for about 5 min with Western Blue stabilized substrate for alkaline phosphatase (Promega, Madison, WI). The blots were washed with deionized water, incubated with 0.18 m trichloroacetic acid for 10 min, then washed, and stored in deionized water. The gels were imaged using a VersaDoc 3000 (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by densitometry with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) or National Institutes of Health ImageJ software. The percentage of protein splicing was calculated from densitometry data and is described by [(MH)/(MH + MIH)] × 100, in which MH is the spliced product, and MIH is the unspliced precursor protein. The percentage of N-terminal cleavage is described by [M/(M + MIH)] × 100, in which M is the N-terminal product of the N-terminal cleavage reaction. C-terminal cleavage is described by [(I)/(I + IH)] × 100, in which I is the product of C-terminal cleavage of IH, which is the C-terminal product of the N-terminal cleavage reaction. Rate constants of splicing assume a first order rate expression and were calculated from the slopes of plots of ln (1 – [(MH)/(MH + MIH)]) versus time in seconds. The rate constants of N-terminal cleavage assume a pseudo-first order rate constant and were calculated from the slopes of plots of ln (1 – [(M)/(M + MIH)]) versus time in seconds. High resolution mass spectrometry data were obtained at the University of Massachusetts Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility (Worcester, MA). PolWT and PolQN were subjected to protein splicing conditions described above for 12 h at 50 °C. The samples were analyzed using a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer and samples were separated by reverse phase chromatography using a 300 Å, 1 × 15-mm C18p3 column (LCPackings, Sunnyvale, CA) with a 10-min linear gradient of 2–90% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at 50 μl/min. Purification of Fusion Proteins—We were able to isolate proteins consisting of a fusion of N-terminal E. coli MBP to the seven C-terminal N-extein residues, 185 intein residues, and six N-terminal C-extein residues of the P. abyssi PolII intein, fused to a C-terminal His tag. Upon purification at room temperature using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and analysis by SDS-PAGE, single bands corresponding to the expected molecular mass of 66.7 kDa were observed (Fig. 2A). It was also shown via Western blot using anti-His tag antibodies that these bands contained the C-terminal His tag (Figs. 3B and 4B). The amino acid substitutions in PolQN, PolCA, PolHA, and PolQNHA are given in Fig. 2B.Fig. 4Analysis of N-terminal cleavage of PolHA and PolQNHA. PolHA (1.0 μm) and PolQNHA (0.95 μm) were incubated under the splicing conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” for 18hat70 °C. A, SDS-PAGE analysis of N-terminal cleavage. Lanes 1 and 3 consist of purified 2.0 μg of PolHA and 1.9 μg of PolQNHA, respectively. Lanes 2 and 4 consist of 30 μl of protein splicing mixture. SDS-PAGE performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, Western blot analysis of N-terminal cleavage. Identical SDS-PAGE analysis was run as in A, except that proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and analyzed by Western blot as described under “Experimental Procedures” using anti-His tag antibody, which selectively identifies the unspliced precursor, MIH, and the resulting intein fragment from N-terminal cleavage, IH, but not the N-terminal cleavage product M or the product of intein C-terminal cleavage, I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Analysis of Protein Splicing and Cleavage Reactions—In our experimental system, in vitro protein splicing should result in the conversion of the 66.7-kDa MIH precursor to the 45.2-kDa MH spliced product and the 21.5-kDa excised intein, I. Cleavage at the N-terminal splice junction would be expected to result in production of M (43.7 kDa) and IH (23.0 kDa). SDS-PAGE analysis of the 18 h, 70 °C incubation of PolWT and PolQN in the presence of 2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and 10 mm EDTA resulted in bands consistent with the formation of protein splicing products MH and I as well as residual MIH (Fig. 3A). The identity of these bands was verified by Western blot analysis with anti-His tag antibodies (Fig. 3B), because the bands corresponding to MIH and MH reacted with the antibody, and the band corresponding to the excised intein, I, did not. Incubation of PolHA and PolQNHA at 70 °C for 18 h did not result in detectable protein splicing. Instead, SDS-PAGE analysis detected bands consistent with the production of M, I, and IH, in addition to residual MIH (Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis with anti-His tag antibodies showed that the bands corresponding to MIH and IH had the His tag, and bands corresponding to M and I did not (Fig. 4B). The presence of the excised intein for PolHA and PolQNHA suggests that either the cleaved IH band is capable of C-terminal cleavage after N-terminal cleavage, that C-terminal cleavage of MIH precedes N-terminal cleavage, or a mixture of both. It is difficult to distinguish MIH (66.7 kDa) from MI (65.3 kDa) via SDS-PAGE because of the small size of the C-extein used in the fusion protein. Mass Spectrometry of Excised Inteins—To determine whether we could detect any modification of the C-terminal intein residue during protein splicing, PolWT and PolQN were incubated under splicing conditions at 50 °C for 12 h and analyzed via high resolution ion trap liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A peak with a deconvoluted mass of 21521.0 Da was detected in the PolWT splicing mixture, consistent with the predicted molecular mass of 21522.3 Da. For splicing with PolQN, a peak with a deconvoluted mass of 21509.0 Da was detected, consistent with the predicted value of 21508.3 Da. Temperature Dependence of Protein Splicing and Cleavage Reactions—To study the effect of temperature on protein splicing, PolWT and PolQN were incubated under splicing conditions for 18 h at different temperatures. No detectable protein splicing or cleavage reactions were observed after 18 h at 4 °C or 20 °C for either protein. Protein splicing increased with temperature for both constructs at 30 °C and above, with PolQN reaching a plateau of 80–85% splicing between 50 and 70 °C (Fig. 5A). Protein splicing of the wild-type construct PolWT reached 74% at 70 °C (Fig. 5A). Temperature-dependent N-terminal cleavage was detected for constructs PolHA, PolQNHA, and PolCA. At 70 °C, PolQNHA cleaved to 88%, and PolHA cleaved to 72% (Fig. 5B). Although incubation of both PolQNHA and PolHA resulted in detectable N-terminal cleavage at 20 °C after 18 h, N-terminal cleavage of PolCA was only detectable with incubation at 40 °C and did not reach the same extent (only 58%) at 70 °C as PolHA and PolQNHA (Fig. 5B). C-terminal cleavage was detected for PolHA, PolQNHA, and PolCA. For PolQNHA, this cleavage was plotted as a function of temperature. C-terminal cleavage was detectable for PolQNHA only at 50 °C and above, higher than for N-terminal cleavage of this construct (Fig. 5C). We have defined C-terminal cleavage as the ratio of band I to bands I plus IH, assuming that all C-terminal cleavage is of the N-terminal cleavage product. Rate Constants for Splicing and N-terminal Cleavage Reactions—We have determined the rate constants for protein splicing and N-terminal cleavage (Tables I and II). The rate constant for protein splicing for PolQN is from 2.8 to 3.6 times that of PolWT at all temperatures tested.Table IRate constants for protein splicingTemperaturekPolWTPolQNs-140 °C3.9 × 10-61.1 × 10-552 °C8.8 × 10-63.2 × 10-560 °C9.3 × 10-63.4 × 10-570 °C1.6 × 10-55.7 × 10-5 Open table in a new tab Table IIRate constants for N-terminal cleavageTemperaturekPolHAPolQNHAPolCAs-165 °C9.8 × 10-61.8 × 10-55.3 × 10-6 Open table in a new tab For N-terminal cleavage, the rate constant was measured at 65 °C. Although rate constants were not measured for protein splicing of PolWT or PolQN at that temperature, rate constants can be interpolated using the Arrhenius equation. For PolHA at 65 °C, the rate constant for N-terminal cleavage was 9.8 × 10–6 s–1, as opposed to an interpolated rate constant of splicing of 1.3 × 10–5 s–1 for PolWT. For PolQNHA, the rate constant of N-terminal cleavage at 65 °C is 1.8 × 10–5 s–1, compared with an interpolated rate constant of splicing for PolQN of 4.7 × 10–5 s–1. Dependence of Splicing and Cleavage Reactions on pH—For PolWT and PolQN, protein splicing was most optimal between pH values of 6.8 and 7.4 and declined at higher pH values (Fig. 6A). However, N-terminal cleavage of PolHA and PolQNHA was optimal between pH 7.4 and 7.8 (Fig. 6B). The pH profile of N-terminal cleavage of PolCA was more consistent with that of the protein splicing of PolWT and PolQN than the N-terminal cleavage of PolHA and PolQNHA (Fig. 6). This paper describes the in vitro protein splicing of the P. abyssi PolII intein. This is the second reported intein with a C-terminal Gln residue that has been shown to facilitate protein splicing. Four inteins with C-terminal Gln have been predicted from genomic sequencing data (9Pietrokovski S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R634-R635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Amitai G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), including the P. abyssi PolII intein, two other PolII inteins in Pyrococcus horikoshii, and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, and the experimentally characterized RNR intein from the Chilo iridescent virus (10Amitai G. Dassa B. Pietrokovski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3121-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the RNR intein from CIV is evolutionarily distinct from the thermophilic PolII inteins (9Pietrokovski S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R634-R635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Amitai G. Dassa B. Pietrokovski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3121-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), so the discovery that the P. abyssi PolII intein can facilitate splicing demonstrates that this alternative mode of protein splicing is a general, if not common, phenomenon. The PolII intein facilitates protein splicing both with a C-terminal Gln as well as with a C-terminal Gln-Asn substitution. Although the substitution of Asn for Gln in the CIV RNR intein resulted in a 7-fold reduction in protein splicing yield (10Amitai G. Dassa B. Pietrokovski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3121-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), both the yield and rate of protein splicing were moderately improved by substitution of Asn for Gln in"

Two properties of proton-coupled OXPHOS by alkaliphilic Bacillus species pose a challenge to this tenet: robust ATP synthesis at pH 10.5 that does not correlate with the magnitude of the Δp and the failure of artificially imposed potentials to substitute for respiration-generated potentials in energizing ATP synthesis at high pH (Krulwich, T.

Robust H+-coupled OXPHOS by extremely alkaliphilic Bacillus strains growing on non-fermentable carbon sources at external pH values ≥10.5 poses one of the most striking challenges to the strictly bulk energization model (10Krulwich T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol.

Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3111-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At such pH values, maintenance of a cytoplasmic pH that is much lower than the external pH, i.e. a ΔpH that is acid in, lowers the total chemiosmotic driving force, and yet OXPHOS proceeds optimally (10Krulwich T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13Sturr M.G. Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3111-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A variety of solutions to the energetic conundrum of alkaliphile OXPHOS have been proposed (for reviews, see Refs. 10Krulwich T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar and 14Cherepanov T.A. Feniouk B.A. Junge W. Mulkidjanian A.Y. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1307-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that special properties of the alkaliphile ATP synthase are needed for OXPHOS at high pH that depend upon the presence of specific amino acid residues or stretches of amino acids in functionally important regions of the membrane-embedded a- and c-subunits of the enzyme (10Krulwich T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Ivey D.M. Krulwich T.A. Res. Microbiol. 1992; 143: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Other hypotheses have suggested global features of the alkaliphile membrane, membrane surface, or cell wall-associated polymers (see Refs. 10Krulwich T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar and 14Cherepanov T.A. Feniouk B.A. Junge W. Mulkidjanian A.Y. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1307-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) that contribute to the resolution of the alkaliphile energetic problem. It has recently been proposed that a single global feature of this kind, i.e. a sufficiently low pH near the membrane surface, can completely account for alkaliphile OXPHOS (14Cherepanov T.A. Feniouk B.A. Junge W. Mulkidjanian A.Y. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1307-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), eliminating any need for special features of the enzymes that directly participate in OXPHOS. The goal of the current studies was to test whether in fact apparent alkaliphile-specific features of two membrane-embedded ATP synthase subunits are specifically important for non-fermentative growth of alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 by changing them to the consensus sequence for non-alkaliphilic Bacillus species. If the alkaliphile F0 sequence features are required for OXPHOS at high pH, mutants expressing normal levels of an altered ATP synthase would be expected to be specifically defective in non-fermentative growth and OXPHOS at pH 10.5. If, on the other hand, there are features of the surface layers that obviate the need for special adaptations of the alkaliphile OXPHOS machinery itself, the mutants would be without a specific OXPHOS phenotype at high pH. Two signatures of alkaliphile OXPHOS are exhibited by whole cells and ADP + Pi-loaded membrane vesicles of alkaliphilic B. pseudofirmus OF4 that lack cell wall polymers (10Krulwich T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9580-9588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Guffanti A.A.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3111-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Along with non-fermentative growth at high pH, these signature properties were used in this study to evaluate the OXPHOS phenotypes of the mutants and develop information about potential roles of particular ATP synthase features. First, the “quantitative signature” of alkaliphile OXPHOS is the generation of a higher ΔGp (reflecting the [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] ratio expressed in mV) at pH 10.5 than at pH 7.5 even though the Δp is about 3 times higher at the lower pH. In a strictly bulk chemiosmotic model, the ΔGp should exhibit a direct relationship to the bulk Δp. The lower Δp at high pH results from a large “chemiosmotically reversed” bulk pH gradient, acid in, that is required at pH 10.5. Although the other component of the Δp, the ΔΨ, increases in the productive direction (positive out) at the higher pH, this increase does not come close to offsetting the chemiosmotically adverse pH gradient (10Krulwich T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13Sturr M.G. Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3111-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The second property of alkaliphile OXPHOS that is at odds with strict coupling to a bulk Δp is a “qualitative signature” that is also assessed in one group of mutants studied here. This “signature” is the inability of a valinomycin-mediated potassium diffusion potential to energize ATP synthesis comparably to a respiration-generated ΔΨ of the same magnitude. At elevated pH values at which the ΔΨ is the sole Δp component energizing ATP synthesis, an artificially imposed potential of the same magnitude would be predicted by the chemiosmotic model to work just as well as the respiration-generated potential. Rather, overall energization of ATP synthesis by the imposed potential is much lower than energization by respiration in alkaliphile cells and ADP + Pi-loaded membrane vesicles (11Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9580-9588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21576-21582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most notably, although the imposed potentials can still energize transport up to external pH values of 10.5, they lose their ability to energize ATP synthesis totally as the external pH rises above 9.2 where alkaliphile growth on OXPHOS-requiring substrates is still optimal (10Krulwich T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9580-9588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21576-21582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sturr M.G. Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3111-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that failure of imposed potentials to energize ATP synthesis above pH 9.2 reflects a pH-dependent gating of proton entry into the alkaliphile ATP synthase. Presumably such gating would also block proton loss to the bulk through the synthase when the alkalinity is particularly high and the bulk Δp is particularly low (Ref. 10Krulwich T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). An element of the ATP synthase responsible for such gating would be expected to reside in the proton uptake pathway of the a-subunit through which protons entering from the bulk pass en route to the critical carboxylate of the rotary c-subunit assembly (4Stock D. Gibbons C. Arechaga I. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 16Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht E. Trends Biochem.

At pH values above the hypothesized gating pH, protons presumably could gain entry without first equilibrating with the bulk phase as proposed by others, e.g. by a proton-gathering element (21Marantz Y. Nachliel E. Aagaard A. Brzezinski P. Gutman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8590-8595Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Nachliel E. Gutman M. Tittor J. Oesterhelt D. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 416-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), from anionic surface lipids (23Haines T.H. Dencher N.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), from protons trapped in the surface water layer (14Cherepanov T.A. Feniouk B.A. Junge W. Mulkidjanian A.Y. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1307-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), or from an interacting proton-extruding respiratory chain complex (24Qiu Z.-H. Yu L. Yu C.-A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3297-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, we first built on the initial observations of alkaliphile-specific sequence features in a- and c-subunits of the F0-ATP synthase (15Ivey D.M. Krulwich T.A. Res. Microbiol. 1992; 143: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using the expanded data base and greatly increased information about the Escherichia coli enzyme to identify the a- and c-subunit features to be mutagenized. Two single amino acids and one hydrophilic loop segment in the alkaliphile a-subunit and two single amino acids and one membrane-embedded segment in the alkaliphile c-subunit differed significantly from the homologous neutrophile sequences. These sequences of B. pseudofirmus OF4 were changed to that of non-alkaliphilic Bacillus megaterium, which represents the consensus sequence for Bacillus. Five of the six mutants were found to assemble an active ATP synthase, but they still exhibited a defect in non-fermentative growth at high pH. Assays of the two signatures of alkaliphile OXPHOS at pH 10.5 further indicated that the sequence features in these mutants are likely to have different mechanistic roles. Bacterial Strains, Genetic Manipulations, and Growth Conditions—Alkaliphilic B. pseudofirmus OF4 strain 811M, a methionine auxotroph of B. pseudofirmus OF4 (25Clejan S. Guffanti A.A. Cohen M.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was the parent strain for the F0 mutant studies. Homologous recombination using the temperature-sensitive plasmid pG+host4 (Appligene, Pleasanton, CA) was used to construct a ΔatpB-F (ΔF0) strain by methods described previously (26Ito M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Ivey D.M. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3851-3857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations were made in a cassette that was reintroduced into the deletion strain (26Ito M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Ivey D.M. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3851-3857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) so that a new EcoRI restriction site was created in codons 162–163 of atpB. The primers used for this and other constructs made in this study are shown in Table I. The wild type used for all the experiments was prepared by reintroducing the wild type sequence, with the added EcoRI site, into the deletion strain. This strain exhibited no difference from its parent wild type strain in its capacity for OXPHOS and non-fermentative growth. All the other mutations changed B. pseudofirmus OF4 sequences for single amino acids or small stretches of amino acids to the sequence(s) found in the equivalent position(s) of the B. megaterium ATP synthase. Single amino acid mutations were made by the method of Kunkel et al. (27Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) with a bacteriophage M13m19 F0 template that was identical to the cassette cloned into pG+host4. The multiple amino acid replacements (a-loop and cTMH1) were made by the PCR overlap extension method described by Ho et al. (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The mutations that were constructed included the following in the a-subunit: a-loop, residues 97–106 (equivalent to 128–137 in E. coli), from FELYNPTTHE to FAIVIDHN; a180 (218 in E. coli), from Lys to Gly, a212 (245 in E. coli), from Gly to Ser; double mutant a180 and a212, Lys to Gly and Gly to Ser, respectively. The mutants in the c-subunit were the following: cTMH1, residues 15–23 (22–30 in E. coli), from VAGAIAVAI to LGAGIGNGL; c33 (40 in E. coli), from Thr to Ala; and c51 (58 in E. coli), from Pro to Ala. The F0 segment of each mutant was entirely sequenced and verified to have only the desired mutation(s). Initial characterizations of growth properties were nonetheless conducted on four to six independent mutants of each type to be sure that each strain used for subsequent detailed studies represented a phenotype that was reproducibly found as a result of the particular mutagenic change. Cloning was performed in E. coli XL-1 Blue (Promega, Madison, WI) grown in Luria broth using 250 μg/ml erythromycin as selection for pG+host4. B. pseudofirmus OF4 strain 811M and mutant derivatives were routinely grown at 30 °C in a semidefined medium containing 0.1% yeast extract with mineral salts and buffered with 0.1 m MOPS-NaOH at pH 7.5 or 0.1 m Na2CO3/NaHCO3 at pH 10.5 (26Ito M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Ivey D.M. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3851-3857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth experiments were conducted in which the sole carbon source was the yeast extract or with added 50 mm glucose or 50 mm sodium dl-malate. Growth on glucose is reported as the A600 after subtracting the amount of growth on yeast extract alone. The ΔF0 strain exhibited very little growth on malate in excess of the growth on yeast extract alone, but this small fermentative component was subtracted from the raw A600 data for malate growth so that the values presented represent the growth yield from non-fermentative growth.Table IPrimers used in this studyPrimer nameSequence (5′-3′)aUnderlined sequences are restriction sites; mutagenized nucleotides are in boldCorresponding sequencebAccording to GenBank™ accession number AF330160PurposeF0BamFCGGGATCCTCCTATATAGTTGGGGGAGT2743-2765Cloning of F0F0EcoRCGGAATTCCTCTGGTTTGATGCTC5596-5578SameF0-markedFGGGGAATTCGCCAACACATTAACTCTT3802-3819Insertion of EcoRI site into codons 162-163 of a-subunitF0-markedRGGGGAATTCTTCAATAATTTTAAATGGCA3797-3776SameΔF0-BamF1GACTGGATCCAAATTCACGCACCCAACC2420-2439Deletion of F0ΔF0-SacR1ATGCGAGCTCAATAGGCGGCTTATGAT3339-3320SameΔF0-SacF1AGTCGAGCTCAATGAAGCAGAACAAGAGAAGC4947-4968SameΔF0-KpnR1AGTCGGTACCATCACCAACACGGATAACC5687-5665SameBme a-loopFCCATTTGCCATCGTGATTGACCATAACGTTTGGTGGAAGTCACCAAC3631-3650a-Loop mutation(replace 3604-3630)Bme a-loopRCCAAACGTTATGGTCAATCACGATGGCAAATGGCAGCCCAAGCATATTAG3604-3581Same(replace 3604-3630)Bme TMH1FCTAGGTGCTGGTATTGGTAACGGTCTTATTGTAAAAGCAACAATCGAGG4199-4220cTMH1 mutation(replace 4172-4198)Bme TMH1RAAGACCGTTACCAATACCAGCACCTAGCGCTGCTAAACCTGCTGCGATAG4171-4149Same(replace 4172-4198)aK180GGGTAACGTTTATGCCGGAGAGATCCTGATGATC3835-3867aK180G mutation(replace 3849-3851)aG212STGGCAAGCATTTAGCCTGTTTATTGGTGCGATC3934-3966aG212S mutation(replace 3949)cT33AACAATCGAGGGAACAGCTCGTCAACCAGAAC4211-4241cT33A mutation(replace 4226)cP51ATTATCGGGGTTGCTCTTGCTGAGG4269-4292cP51A mutation(replace 4280)a Underlined sequences are restriction sites; mutagenized nucleotides are in boldb According to GenBank™ accession number AF330160 Open table in a new tab Isolation of Everted Membrane Vesicles and ATPase Assays—Everted membrane vesicles were prepared from overnight cultures grown at pH 7.5 with malate as the energy source as described earlier (29Hicks D.B. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20547-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that a battery of protease inhibitors was included in the French press buffer (1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.06 μm bestatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μm E-64 (N-(trans-epoxysuccinyl)-l-leucine 4-guanidinobutylamide), 1 μm phosphoramidon, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, final concentrations) (29Hicks D.B. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20547-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Octylglucoside-stimulated ATPase assays, which were carried out for 3 min at 37 °C, contained, in a 0.5-ml volume, 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 5 mm ATP (sodium salt, Sigma), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 30 mm octylglucoside, 50 mm Na2SO3, and 50 μg of membrane protein (29Hicks D.B. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20547-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unstimulated ATPase activity using 0.4 mg of membrane protein was measured in a 1-ml volume containing 50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP. The reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and terminated by trichloroacetic acid addition (5% final concentration). The precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were analyzed for liberated Pi by the method of LeBel et al. (30LeBel D. Poirier G.G. Beaudoin A.R. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Blank and Pi standard tubes received an equivalent volume of membranes after trichloroacetic acid addition. For DCCD inhibition, everted membrane vesicles were preincubated with 4.8 μl of methanol (no DCCD) or 25 mm DCCD (to 100 μm final concentration) in 1.2 ml at a concentration of 2.6 mg of protein/ml for 30 min at room temperature in 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2. They were then diluted 4-fold into assay buffer (67 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2) and equilibrated at 37 °C, and the reaction was carried out for 30 min after addition of 5 mm ATP. Reactions were terminated by addition of trichloroacetic acid and analyzed as described above. Control experiments were carried out with purified B. pseudofirmus OF4 F1-ATPase prepared as described earlier (31Hicks D.B. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12896-12902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead of membranes, 50 μg of purified F1 was included in the 1.2-ml preincubation mixture, and Pi was determined by the malachite green assay (32Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). The experiments showed no DCCD inhibition of F1 under these conditions. Western Analyses—Everted membrane vesicles equivalent to 5 μg of protein were loaded in each lane (except for the cTMH1 mutant for which 25 or 50 μg of protein was used), resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels (33Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar), and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose overnight in a Tris/glycine/methanol buffer. Western blots were carried out by the chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The β subunit of the F1F0 was detected using a monoclonal antibody against the E. coli β subunit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Scanned blots were quantitated using Quantity One analysis software from Bio-Rad. Measurements of ΔGp and Δp—Cells were grown overnight in semidefined malate medium at pH 8.5. A fresh culture at pH 8.5, with the yeast extract lowered from 0.1 to 0.02%, was inoculated from the overnight culture and allowed to grow for 3 h. Cells were harvested and washed free of nutrients with pH 8.5 buffer (100 mm Na2CO3/NaHCO3, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm KPi), then diluted 1:15 into pH 7.5 or 10.5 buffer (100 mm MOPS-NaOH and 100 mm Na2CO3/NaHCO3, respectively) containing 10 mm malate, and shaken at 30 °C. The dilution marked the zero time for the experiment and was ∼30 min after the end of the 3-h growth period. During that period, cytoplasmic ATP levels dropped about 75%. This depletion is less than used in earlier studies that included long starvation periods before re-energization (11Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9580-9588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments indicated that the gentler protocol was required for the wild type and mutant panel to retain uniform viability and a normal capacity for ΔΨ generation. Samples were taken at zero time, 1 h, and 3 h for assays of [ATP], [ADP], [Pi], ΔpH, and ΔΨ. The intracellular pH was calculated using measurements of the external pH and ΔpH. ΔpH was determined from the distribution of radiolabeled probes, methylamine for ΔpH acid in and dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione for ΔpH acid out, which were used at 2 μm and whose accumulation was assayed via a filtration assay (26Ito M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Ivey D.M. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3851-3857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ΔΨ was calculated from the distribution of the ΔΨ probe tetraphenylphosphonium bromide using the Nernst equation. Probe distribution was assayed using 2 μm tritiated probe and a filtration assay that had been validated using imposed diffusion potentials of known magnitude (34Krulwich T.A. Guffanti A.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 663-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ATP was measured by the luciferinluciferase assay (35Cole H. Wimpenny J.W.T. Hughes D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 143: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 36Stanley P.E. Williams S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 29: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), and ADP was similarly assayed after its enzymatic conversion to ATP using pyruvate kinase (37Chapman A.G. Fall L. Atkinson D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 1072-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of the starting ATP and ADP concentrations of cells and of background ATP and ADP of unenergized vesicles were conducted. Inorganic phosphate was measured by the method of LeBel et al. (30LeBel D. Poirier G.G. Beaudoin A.R. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). For calculation of the ΔGp, the value of ΔG0 for the measured cytoplasmic pH was used (38Rosing J. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Assays of ATP Synthesis in ADP + Pi-loaded Membrane Vesicles—Measurements of ATP synthesis in right-side-out membrane vesicles were performed as in earlier studies (12Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol.

For experiments in which ATP synthesis was energized by an electron donor, 10 mm ascorbate plus 0.1 mm phenazine methosulfate, the vesicles were loaded with 20 mm potassium phosphate, 5 mm sodium phosphate, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm potassium ADP at a final pH of 8.3. The same mixture was used to load the vesicles for generation of a diffusion potential at pH 8.3; for the vesicles to be energized by a diffusion potential at pH 9.3, the final pH of the loaded solution was 9.3.

Protein Kinase B (PKB) is an important member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways in several eukaryotes, but the role of PKB in protozoan parasites is not known. We have identified a protein kinase B homologue in Plasmodium falciparum (PfPKB) that is expressed mainly in the schizonts and merozoites. Even though PfPKB shares high sequence homology with PKB catalytic domain, it lacks a pleckstrin homology domain typically found at the N terminus of the mammalian enzyme. Biochemical studies performed to understand the mechanism of PfPKB catalytic activation suggested (i) its activation is dependent on autophosphorylation of a serine residue (Ser-271) in its activation loop region and (ii) PfPKB has an unusual N-terminal region that was found to negatively regulate its catalytic activity. We also identified an inhibitor of PfPKB activity that also inhibits P. falciparum growth, suggesting that this enzyme may be important for the development of the parasite.

https://openalex.org/W2036457858,"Self-splicing group I introns are being found in an increasing number of bacteriophages. Most introns contain an open reading frame coding for a homing endo-nuclease that confers mobility to both the intron and the homing endonuclease gene (HEG). The frequent occurrence of intron/HEG has raised questions whether group I introns are spread via horizontal transfer between phage populations. We have determined complete sequences for the known group I introns among T-even-like bacteriophages together with sequences of the intron-containing genes td, nrdB, and nrdD from phages with and without introns. A previously uncharacterized phage isolate, U5, is shown to contain all three introns, the only phage besides T4 found with a “full set” of these introns. Sequence analysis of td and nrdB genes from intron-containing and intronless phages provides evidence that recent horizontal transmission of introns has occurred among the phages. The fact that several of the HEGs have suffered deletions rendering them non-functional implies that the homing endonucleases are of no selective advantage to the phage and are rapidly degenerating and probably dependent upon frequent horizontal transmissions for maintenance within the phage populations. Several of the introns can home to closely related intronless phages during mixed infections. However, the efficiency of homing varies and is dependent on homology in regions flanking the intron insertion site. The occurrence of optional genes flanking the respective intron-containing gene can strongly affect the efficiency of homing. These findings give further insight into the mechanisms of propagation and evolution of group I introns among the T-even-like bacteriophages.

The three self-splicing group I introns in bacteriophage T4 were the first prokaryotic introns to be found. The T4 introns are situated in the genes coding for the small subunit of the aerobic ribonucleotide reductase (nrdB) (1Gott J.M. Shub D.A. Belfort M.

The presence of introns in a bacteriophage was unexpected, because phages generally are under strong selective pressure to keep a compact genome to maintain rapid replication and to fit the genome inside the phage capsid. The subsequent finding that the T4 introns are mobile genetic elements, mediated by the presence of a homing endonuclease gene (HEG) 1The abbreviations used are: HEG, homing endonuclease gene; IS, intron insertion site. within each intron, gives an explanation to how they were inserted into the phage genome (5Quirk S.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3763-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but the low number of introns among T-even-like phages has hitherto prevented a systematic study of how the introns have propagated within this phage population. Phages of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria have subsequently been shown to contain group I introns, all belonging to the same subgroup (IA2) of group I introns as the T-even introns indicating a common ancestry of phage introns.

Homing endonucleases are a diverse group of proteins that generates double strand cuts in DNA at, or near, a generally very long recognition sequence spanning up to 40 bp (for reviews see Refs. 17Belfort M. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3379-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 18Chevalier B.S. Stoddard B.L.

HEGs are often associated with self-splicing introns or inteins and can confer mobility both to themselves and to their surrounding splicing element via the process of homing. Intron homing occurs when a HEG-containing intron encounters a cognate chromosome copy without an intron (i.e. for phage introns during mixed infection with a cognate or closely related phage without intron). The recognition sites of intron-associated homing endonucleases generally span their respective intron insertion site, and they will therefore only cleave intronless alleles. Intron-containing alleles are immune to cleavage, because the intron interrupts the recognition site. After cleavage the double-strand break is repaired via recombination-dependent replication repair, using an intact, intron-containing chromosome copy as template (20Mueller J.E. Clyman J. Huang Y.J. Parker M.M. Belfort M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This results in insertion of the intron and the HEG into the repaired genome. Efficient homing is dependent upon sequence homology between donor and recipient alleles in the sequences flanking the insertion site (5Quirk S.M. Bell-Pedersen D. Belfort M. Cell. 1989; 56: 455-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Clyman J. Belfort M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Parker M.M.

If the requirement of homology in the homing site and surrounding regions is met the efficiency of homing can be close to 100%. Of the three HEGs in the T4 introns the td and nrdD HEGs (denoted I-TevI and I-TevII, respectively) belong to the GIY-YIG family of endonucleases. They have been shown to specifically cleave intronless alleles of td and nrdD, respectively (6Bell-Pedersen D. Quirk S. Clyman J. Belfort M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3763-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Bell-Pedersen D. Quirk S.M. Aubrey M. Belfort M.

A. 1990; 87: 3574-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The T4 nrdB intron contains a non-functional HEG of the H-N-H family, named I-TevIII, which has suffered a large deletion and therefore cannot promote homing (5Quirk S.M. Bell-Pedersen D. Belfort M. Cell. 1989; 56: 455-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Eddy S.R. Gold L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1032-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that T4 is exceptional among its closer relatives in having several introns. Most of the known T-even-like phages completely lack introns, whereas a small number only contain the td intron (27Eddy S. Introns in the T-even Bacteriophages. University of Colorado, Boulder1992Google Scholar, 28Quirk S.M. Bell-Pedersen D. Tomaschewski J. Ruger W. Belfort M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The only phage besides T4 that has been shown to have more than one intron is RB3, which has a td intron and an nrdB intron with an intact, functional HEG (26Eddy S.R. Gold L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1032-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Given the high efficiency of homing of the two functional T4 introns (6Bell-Pedersen D. Quirk S. Clyman J. Belfort M.

Krisch H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30Tetart F. Desplats C. Kutateladze M. Monod C. Ackermann H.W. Krisch H.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and perhaps also globally between different phages (31Hendrix R.W. Smith M.C. Burns R.N. Ford M.E. Hatfull G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), it is striking how few phages actually contain introns. Here we show that the previously uncharacterized T-even-like phage isolate, U5, contains all three known T-even introns. This gives a total of 11 identified introns (6 td, 3 nrdB, and 2 nrdD) within the T-even-like phages and enables a systematic study of how group I introns have propagated within this phage population. We have used a combination of sequence comparisons of the introns and the intron-containing genes from a number of phages belonging to the T-even-like family as well as mixed infections between phages with and without introns/HEGs to determine the history and potential of intron transfer among these phages. Our results provide evidence for a recent horizontal spread of introns mediated by the cognate HEGs among phages with high sequence similarity at the intron insertion sites. We also show that homing can overcome the effect of genetic exclusion that occurs between some phages and that the presence of optional genes flanking the intron-containing genes can strongly affect the efficiency of homing.

PCR Amplification and Sequencing of nrdB, nrdD, and td Genes from T-even-like Phages—Individual plaques were picked and suspended in 40 μl of water per reaction. 20 μl of this suspension was used as template for PCR. Amplifications were performed using 2.5 units of proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) for 30 cycles according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Primers for PCR amplification of td, nrdB, and nrdD genes were based on T4 sequences.

Primers specific for TuIa were: TuIatd1 5′-TGATAGAACATATGACAAGGAGG, TuIatd2 5′-TGCCTTGACGCATATTGTAGCG, TuIanrdB1 5′-TGTGTATACGAACGAGAGTG, and TuIanrdB2 5′-CAACGCCTTAGAAGCTATTCG. PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels and purified using a Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit to remove buffers, nucleotides, and primers prior to sequencing. PCR fragments were sequenced on both strands with primers based on known T4 sequences using a DYEnamic ET terminator cycle sequencing kit or DYEnamic ET terminator cycle sequencing for MEGA Bace from Amersham Biosciences. Samples were analyzed on an ABIPrism377 sequencing machine at the KISeq facility at the Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics at Karolinska Institutet. The sequences of the td, nrdB, and nrdD genes obtained in this study have been reported to GenBank™ and given accession numbers AY262125-AY262157. During the progress of this project the complete genome sequences of phages RB49 and RB69 and the Aeromonas phage Aeh1 were determined as part of The T4-like Phages Genome Project (Drs. J. D. Karam, H. M. Krisch, and J. M. Nolan). Sequences from these phages used in the following analyses were obtained from the GenBank™ genome data (accession numbers NC_005066, NC_004928, and AY266303, respectively). In Vitro GTP Labeling of Introns—Group I splicing was studied in vitro by observing the autocatalytic addition of a guanosine nucleotide ([α-32P]GTP) to the 5′-end of the intron (1Gott J.M. Shub D.A. Belfort M. Cell. 1986; 47: 81-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared by the RNeasy procedure on mini-spin columns (Qiagen), from infected cells. Approximately 15 μg of total RNA was used in the GTP-labeling reaction under self-splicing conditions as described previously (1Gott J.M. Shub D.A. Belfort M. Cell. 1986; 47: 81-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. Labeled bands were visualized by phosphorimaging analysis (FujiFilm FLA-3000). For the additional screen for potential uncharacterized group I introns in U5, genomic DNA from U5 was cleaved with NdeI and ligated to a pBluescript (KS+) derivate. PCR was performed using one vector-specific primer together with either a 5′-3′-directed or a 3′-5′-directed degenerate primer based on the conserved catalytic center of group I introns. Degenerate primer sequences were as follows: intron primer 5′-3′, 5′-GATATAGTCTGNNCTGCATRG; intron primer 3′-5′, 5′-CYATGCAGNNCAGACTATATC. Generated PCR products were purified and sequenced as described. Phylogenetic Analysis—Sequence alignments were done with ClustalX v. 1.8.1, and phylogenetic analysis was carried out using PAUP v. 4.0b10. 2D. L. Swofford, 2002. PAUP*. Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (*and Other Methods), version 4, Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA. Randomization of intron presence on the gene trees and calculation of frequency distributions for the number of intron losses were performed with MacClade v. 4.06 (Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA). The p values given in the text were calculated for observed minimum number of intron losses for td (5Quirk S.M. Bell-Pedersen D. Belfort M. Cell. 1989; 56: 455-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and nrdB (4Chu F.K. Maley G.F. Maley F. Belfort M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3049-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) from the frequency distributions. Multiplex-PCR Screen for Intron Homing in Mixed Infections—Equal amounts of two phage strains (2.5 × 109 plaque-forming units) were mixed with 5 × 108 cells from a mid log-phase culture giving a multiplicity of infection of 5 of each phage. Incubation was continued for 90 min at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. Cells were lysed with chloroform, and progeny phage were plated on new bacteria. Primers for intron screening of progeny plaques were designed to have similar annealing temperatures and to yield gene-specific fragments for use with all phage combinations unless otherwise stated. For each cross 48 plaques were picked and each resuspended in 20 μl of water. A 5-μl aliquot of the suspension was used as template in a 25-μl PCR reaction with 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Primer sequences for intron presence were as follows: td IVS A, CAATCCCGTGCTAAATTGTAGGAC; td IVS B, CGTTGCATCAGCAATATTGTATCC; td IVS B (TuIa), AGACGCATCAGCAATATTATATCC; nrdB IVS A, CTCCTTTAATTGCTGGAAAGTCC; nrdB IVS B, GGATGGGTCCCGTTCTTAACC; nrdD IVS A, GTCAAGCTCATGTAAAATCTGCC; nrdD IVS B (T4), CTTCATCTTTAAGGGCCGATTC; and nrdD IVS B (u5), CTTCATGTTTAAGGGCCGATTC. When T2 and RB49 were used as recipient phages we also screened for a unique marker gene in each recipient phage (located in a different part of the chromosome compared with the introns) to have a neutral marker to relate intron frequencies to. For T2 gene 42.3 was used, and for RB49 the wac gene was used. Primers used for screening for these genes were: T2 42.3A, 5′-GTTGTTAACGCAGAAAAAGCG; T2 42.3B, 5′-CAAATAACTTTAAAGCATCTTCAG; RB49 wacA, 5′-CATGTTGACGGTGTACCAAGC; RB49 wacB, 5′-GTTAACCGCCGTTACAACCTC. For flanking screens of RB69 crosses primers RB69 nrdA 1, 5′-CCAGTCGATAGGTAATTCGCCTC, and RB69 frd.1 1, 5′-CCAGAGCATCAAAGATTCAGAAG, were used. PCR Amplification and Sequencing of nrdB, nrdD, and td Genes from T-even-like Phages—A total of 21 T-even-like phage strains, including the original T-even phages T2, T4, and T6, were used for amplification of PCR fragments of the nrdB, nrdD, and td genes (Table I). Strains were chosen to include all previously known intron-containing T-even-like phages together with a number of T-even-like phages lacking introns (27Eddy S. Introns in the T-even Bacteriophages. University of Colorado, Boulder1992Google Scholar) and one previously uncharacterized strain (U5 from Uppsala, Sweden). Primers for amplification of td, nrdB, and nrdD were designed to bind in flanking genes to generate fragments of full-length genes for sequencing (see Fig. 1). Direct sequencing of the PCR products from 13 of the phage strains (boldface in Table I) confirmed the presence of all introns seen in the PCR screen. All sequences were readily alignable to the T4 sequences, although larger rearrangements were found in intergenic regions of some phages (data not shown).Table IIntron distribution in T-even like phagesStraintdnrdBnrdDOriginal isolationIntron referenceT2H, LaT2 strain designations: H, originally from A.

Both T2H and T2L were included in the study since there has been an earlier report about incongruence in intron presence between different T2 isolates (28Quirk S.M. Bell-Pedersen D. Tomaschewski J. Ruger W. Belfort M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, both isolates were identical over all sequenced regions (including intergenic regions) and are therefore referred to as T2 in this study. Strains in boldface were chosen for sequencingb -, no intron; +, intron; ?, unknownc References indicate previous reports about intron presence Open table in a new tab The U5 Genome Contains Three Introns—The immediate striking result from the PCR screen was the presence of an intron in each of the td, nrdB, and nrdD genes in the previously uncharacterized phage U5. This is the first phage besides T4 found to contain all three introns. U5 td and nrdD intron sequences are highly similar to the corresponding T4 introns, and the U5 nrdB intron sequence is highly similar to the corresponding RB3 intron, i.e. without the T4 deletion in the endonuclease gene. However, the U5 HEGs I-TevII (in nrdD) and I-TevIII (in nrdB) each contain a 2-bp deletion early in their coding regions, prematurely terminating the I-TevII reading frame after 39 amino acids and the I-TevIII reading frame after 65 amino acids. Furthermore, the sequence shows that the U5 I-TevIII also has a 6-bp deletion exactly spanning the late promoter known to direct the main expression of the I-TevIII homing endonuclease gene (32Gott J.M. Zeeh A. Bell-Pedersen D. Ehrenman K. Belfort M. Shub D.A. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1791-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We therefore propose that the U5 I-TevII and I-TevIII homing endonuclease genes are non-functional and in the process of degeneration. To find out if U5 contains any novel group I introns at other sites in the genome we analyzed total RNA isolated from U5-infected E. coli cells, with the GTP-labeling assay (1Gott J.M. Shub D.A. Belfort M. Cell. 1986; 47: 81-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 2, we found bands of expected sizes for the U5 introns and two weaker bands of lower molecular mass in the U5 lane without counterparts in the T4 lane. These may be products from further processing of the known introns after complete splicing or may represent labeling of uncharacterized novel introns. In a PCR screen of the U5 genome with degenerate primers based on the highly conserved group I intron catalytic core sequences we picked up the td, nrdB, and nrdD introns but failed to detect any novel introns (data not shown). Although this does not completely rule out the possibility of other group I introns in U5, it makes it less likely. Phylogenetic Analyses Support Horizontal Spread of Introns among the T-even-like Phages—To obtain further understanding of the history of intron gain/loss among the T-even-like phages we performed independent phylogenetic analyses of the three intron-containing genes and compared them to the distribution of introns. Such analyses have been used earlier to differentiate between horizontal and vertical spread of mobile introns (33Holst-Jensen A. Vaage M. Schumacher T. Johansen S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34Goddard M.R. Burt A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13880-13885Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 35Rudi K.

Phylogenies were constructed for each of the td, nrdB, and nrdD genes using alignments of exon sequences only. The td and nrdB sequences generate well supported trees (Fig. 3), whereas the nrdD sequences are too similar to yield a reliable tree. All intron-containing genes (marked with an “I” in Fig. 3), except the RB3 and LZ2 td genes, are more closely related to at least one intronless gene than to another intron-containing gene and separated by branches with 100% boot-straps. The scattered distribution of genes with introns indicates either gain of introns via horizontal transfer, or multiple independent intron losses. If no horizontal intron transfers have occurred the hypothesis predicts that the ancestral phage had introns that were then lost along the lineages leading to taxa with intronless genes. Once an intron is lost by a phage all descendents of that phage would also lack the intron, and,"

We carried out whole mount in situ hybridization of MIF mRNA and found that MIF was expressed at high levels in the neural tissues of normal embryos. Although early embryogenesis of MO-injected embryos proceeded normally until the gastrula stage, their neurulation was completely inhibited. At the tailbud stage, the MO-injected embryos lacked neural and mesodermal tissues, and also showed severe defects in their head and tail structures.

Later studies have revealed that this protein has various functions. For example, MIF is released from the anterior pituitary gland of lipopolysaccharide-challenged mice and potentiates lethal endotoxemia (3Bernhagen J. Calandra T. Mitchell R.A. Martin S.B. Tracey K.J. Voelter W. Manogue K.R. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1993; 365: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). MIF was also found to be essential for T cell activation (4Bacher M. Metz C.N. Calandra T. Mayer K. Chesney J. Lohoff M. Gemsa D. Donnelly T. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7849-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). In addition, MIF has isomerase activity that catalyzes the tautomerization of d-dopachrome and phenylpyruvate (5Rosengren E. Bucala R. Åman P. Jacobsson L. Odh G. Metz C.N. Rorsman H. Mol.

Geiger G. Mischke R. Burger-Kentischer A. Flieger O. Johannes F.-J. Roger T. Calandra T. Kapurniotu A. Grell M. Finkelmeier D. Bunner H. Bernhagen J. Nature. 2000; 408: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Moreover, MIF regulates innate immunity through the modulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (13Roger T. David J. Glauser M.P. Calandra T. Nature. 2001; 414: 920-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The involvement of MIF in a variety of intracellular and extracellular events has led us to speculate that MIF might also have important functions in the development of mammals and other vertebrates. Little is known about the involvement of MIF in vertebrate development, except that the expression of chicken MIF in the developing eye lens is correlated with cell differentiation (14Wistow G.J. Shaughnessy M.P. Lee D.C. Hodin J. Zelenka P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1272-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible functions of MIF in developmental processes, we carried out loss-of-function experiments in embryos of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. For this purpose, we cloned a cDNA for Xenopus MIF (XMIF), and synthesized XMIF-specific antisense morpholino oligomers (MOs). MOs are gaining wide use in developmental biology for blocking the translation of mRNA because of their high efficacy and specificity (15Summerton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 16Heasman J. Kofron M. Wylie C. Dev. Biol. 2000; 222: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 17Heasman J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 243: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In this study, the MO-mediated knockdown of MIF caused a severely altered phenotype, which demonstrated that MIF was an essential factor in Xenopus embryogenesis, and which, furthermore, suggested the importance of mammalian MIF in the development of mammals. Cloning of XMIF cDNA—We prepared total RNA from X. laevis liver and carried out rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) reactions using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The primers used for 5′- and 3′-RACE were 5′-TGCACACGGCACAAGGATCAGTTGA-3′ and 5′-CTGATCCTTGTGCCGTGTGCAGTCTG-3′, respectively. The 5′ and 3′ primers used for the amplification of the full-length cDNA were 5′-AGTGTGCGACCCGTTCTCCATCTTT-3′ and 5′-AATTGCTGTACTTTGTTTATTCAGAAGGGAATG-3′, respectively. The product of this end-to-end PCR was cloned into pBluescript KS+. We sequenced four clones and found that all of them were identical. Preparation of Recombinant MIF Proteins—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, transformed with pET-3a containing Xenopus or rat MIF cDNA, was cultured, and MIF expression was induced by isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were disrupted with a French pressure cell disrupter. From the clarified homogenate, MIF was purified by S-hexylglutathione affinity column chromatography. Determination of Isomerase Activity—The rates of the keto-enol tautomerization of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) catalyzed by MIF were determined as previously described (18Knox W.E. Colowick S.P. Kaplan N.O. Methods in Enzymology. 2. Academic Press, New York1955: 289-292Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 0.5 m sodium borate (pH 6.2), 0.5 mm p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (Sigma), and 0.25 μg/ml MIF. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of XMIF were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m ammonium sulfate and 20% PEG 4000. The reservoir solution was mixed with XMIF at 7.5 mg/ml in a 1:1 volume ratio. After 1 week, the crystals had grown to a size of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm3. The space group of the crystal was R3 with cell dimensions of a = b = 94.41 Å and c = 115.58 Å. A complete x-ray diffraction data set was collected in-house using an R-AXIS IV++ imaging plate at 100 K and the data were processed by the program d*trek.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure was determined by molecular replacement with the human MIF structure (Protein Data Bank code 1MIF) using the program AMoRe (CCP4 suite), a molecular replacement package, which includes routines to run a complete molecular replacement. Structure refinement was performed using the program CNS, a flexible macromolecular structure determination software suite for x-ray crystallography and solution NMR spectroscopy, with manual interventions of the model modification using O, a general purpose macromolecular modeling program. After locating 52 water molecules, we refined the model of XMIF to an R-factor of 24.1% and an R-free factor of 26.6% for the region of 10-2.5-Å resolution. Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were applied throughout the refinement. Embryos and Injection of Reagents—Adult frogs were maintained in dechlorinated tap water in our laboratory at 20-23 °C. Ovulation was induced by the injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (250 units) into females. Fertilized eggs were obtained by artificial insemination using a sperm suspension prepared by mincing testes that were removed from a properly anesthetized male frog. Developmental stages were designated according to the system of Nieuwkoop and Faber (19Nieukoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis, North-Holland, Daudin, Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). Fertilized embryos were dejellied with 2.5% thioglycolic acid (pH 8.3) and were washed several times in Steinberg's solution (58 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm KCl, 0.5 mm Ca(NO3)2, 4.6 mm Tris-HCl, 8 mg/liter phenol red, pH 7.4). At the 4-cell stage, embryos dipped in 3% Ficoll solution were injected with MO (Gene Tools, Philomath, OR) and/or synthesized mRNA using a Nanoject microinjector (Drummond, Broomall, PA) (18.4 nl/embryo). The resultant embryos were cultured until the blastula stage in the same solution and were then allowed to develop further in Steinberg's solution. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (20Shain D.H. Zuber M.X. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1996; 31: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos were fixed in MEMFA (0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 3.7% formaldehyde) for 2 h at room temperature. Hybridization was performed with a digoxigenin-labeled antisense or sense RNA probe for XMIF that was synthesized from a 403-bp insert of XMIF cDNA, including the whole coding region, which had been cloned in pBluescript. The enzymes used for the synthesis of antisense and sense probes were T7 and T3 RNA polymerases, respectively. An antisense probe of zic-2, a pan-neural marker, was synthesized using a 2.9-kb full-length insert that had been cloned in pBluescript. The positive signals were visualized using BM purple (Roche Diagnostics). Embryos were fixed again in MEMFA solution, dehydrated, and replaced with benzyl benzoate/benzyl alcohol (2:1) to enhance the transparency. RT-PCR Analysis—The reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis was carried out according to the methods described in a previous report (21Braun M. Wunderlin M. Spieth K. Knöchel W. Gierschik P. Moepps B. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2340-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from embryos and adult organs by the AGPC method (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized using a SuperScript II preamplification system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was amplified by Ex Taq polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Japan) using XMIF primers (5′-CCGATACCCTTCTGTCCGAT-3′ and 5′-CATTCCAGCCAACGTTTGCA-3′, 265 bp), EF-1α primers (5′-CCTGAATCACCCAGGCCAGATTGGTG-3′ and 5′-GAGGGTAGTCTGAGAAGCTCTCCACG-3′, 221 bp), and histone H4 primers (5′-CGGGATAACATCCAGGGCATC-3′ and 5′-CATAGCGGTAACGGTCTTCCT-3′, 186 bp). The amplification reactions consisted of 28 (XMIF), 24 (H4), and 21 (EF-1α) cycles. In each case, denaturing, annealing, and extension steps (1 min at 94 °C, 1.5 min at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, respectively) were carried out. After a single extension step (5 min at 72 °C), products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane (Biodyne B; Pall, Ann Arbor, MI). The membrane was then hybridized with a radiolabeled DNA probe for XMIF (403 bp), EF-1α (PstI/SacI fragment, 378 bp), or histone H4 (PCR-amplified fragment, 186 bp). Synthesis of Capped RNA for in Vitro Translation and Injection—For the synthesis of XMIF RNA, including its 5′-untranslated region (UTR), the pBluescript plasmid containing the full-length XMIF cDNA was linearized with HindIII. From this template, capped RNA was synthesized using the mMessage mMachine T7 Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Xenopus EF-1α RNA was synthesized from the control template provided with the kit. For the synthesis of XMIF RNA without its 5′ UTR, the coding sequence was amplified and subcloned. The primers used were 5′-CCGCTCGAGCCGCCACCATGCCTGTCTTCACCAT-3′ and 5′-GCCTCTAGATTAGGCAAAGGTAGATCC-3′. A 9-nucleotide Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation (underlined) was included in the 5′ primer. The PCR product was inserted into the XhoI-XbaI site of pCS2+. The plasmid was linearized with NotI, and capped RNA was synthesized using the mMessage mMachine SP6 Kit. In Vitro Translation—XMIF or EF-1α protein was synthesized using nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI). The translation reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 14 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 20 μm methionine-free amino acid mixture, 5 μCi of l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), and 0.5 μg of capped RNA. Translation was carried out at 30 °C for 90 min, followed by addition of RNase A to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and incubation at room temperature for 5 min. Translated products were analyzed by 15% Tricine-SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Histological Observation—Embryos were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in Steinberg's solution, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin (Paraplast; Structure Probe, West Chester, PA), sectioned at 7 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Phylogenetic Analysis of MIF Sequences—The phylogenetic tree was constructed with the aligned amino acid sequences of MIF homologs by the neighbor-joining method (23Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) using the expanded ClustalW program. 2www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/E-mail/homology.html. Positions with gaps were excluded from the analysis. The degree of support for internal branches of the tree was assessed by 1000 bootstrap replicates (24Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA Cloning of XMIF—Although the cloning of full-length cDNA for MIF homologs from Xenopus has not been previously described, an expressed sequence tag (EST) that is similar to mammalian MIF cDNA has been isolated from Xenopus embryos (GenBank™ number BE681403). We assumed that this EST was derived from a gene encoding a protein that was the functional counterpart (ortholog) of mammalian MIF. Thus, we refer to the product of the gene as XMIF (we also refer to it simply as MIF when there is no need to distinguish it from mammalian MIF), and we cloned its full-length cDNA from Xenopus liver by the RACE method. The primers used for the RACE reactions were selected from the EST. Sequencing of 17 clones obtained from 5′ RACE identified two major transcription start sites at -59 and -47, relative to the start codon. Using the terminal sequences of the 5′- and 3′-RACE products, we amplified and cloned a full-length cDNA for XMIF. The resultant 527-bp cDNA started at -59, and contained an open reading frame, the length of which was identical to that of mammalian MIF. The sequence of this cDNA has been deposited in the GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ data base under accession number AB111063. Comparison of XMIF and Mammalian MIF—Fig. 1 shows the deduced amino acid sequence of XMIF compared with those of MIF homologs from different craniate (vertebrate and hagfish) species, including a jawed fish (Paralabidochromis chilotes) and two jawless fishes (Petromyzon marinus and Myxine glutinosa) of distant taxa (25Sato A. Uinuk-ool T.S. Kuroda N. Mayer W.E. Takezaki N. Dongak R. Figueroa F. Cooper M.D. Klein J. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2003; 27: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The N-terminal proline residue, which is the catalytic center of the isomerase activity of mammalian MIF (26Bendrat K. Al-Abed Y. Callaway D.J. Peng T. Calandra T. Metz C.N. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15356-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), is conserved in XMIF. In mammalian MIF, a number of aromatic residues are clustered around this proline (27Sugimoto H. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nishihira J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Sugimoto H. Taniguchi M. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Suzuki M. Nishihira J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3268-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These surrounding residues are all conserved in XMIF, suggesting their importance in the function or formation of the structure of MIF. In addition, the invariant lysine residue at position 32, which contributes to the isomerase activity of the protein (29Johnson W.H. Czerwinski R.M. Stamps S.L. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16024-16033Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30Soares T.A. Goodsell D.S. Ferreira R. Olson A.J. Briggs J.M. J. Mol.

One of these cysteines (Cys56) is conserved in all known MIF homologs from craniate species, including d-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT), and also in some homologs from nematodes. The other cysteine (Cys59) residue of the catalytic center undergoes cysteinylation in human suppressor T hybridoma cells. This modification is essential for the immunosuppressive activity of MIF as a glycosylation-inhibiting factor (31Watarai H. Nozawa R. Tokunaga A. Yuyama N. Tomas M. Hinohara A. Ishizaka K. Ishii Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13251-13256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cys59 is conserved in chicken MIF and in P. chilotes MIF as well, but not in those of jawless fishes (25Sato A. Uinuk-ool T.S. Kuroda N. Mayer W.E. Takezaki N. Dongak R. Figueroa F. Cooper M.D. Klein J. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2003; 27: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of XMIF and the other MIF homologs listed in Fig. 1, and found that the branching pattern of the resultant phylogenetic tree corresponded essentially with the evolutionary relationships among the species (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Phylogenetic tree of MIF and DDT sequences (Fig. 1) constructed by the neighbor-joining method. The length of the branches is proportional to the phylogenetic distances estimated using the empirical method for protein distances of Kimura (32Kimura M.

A plant MIF homolog from Arabidopsis thaliana (TrEMBL accession number Q9LU69) has been included as an outgroup. The numbers indicate the percentages of 1000 bootstrap replicates in which the same internal branch was recovered. The scale bar indicates an evolutionary distance of 0.1 amino acid substitution per position in the sequence. The species abbreviations are the same as those used in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because crucial amino acid residues for the isomerase activity of mammalian MIF were shared with XMIF, we expected XMIF to have the same activity as mammalian MIF. The determined rate of keto-enol tautomerization of HPP catalyzed by XMIF was comparable with that catalyzed by rat MIF (Fig. 3). We carried out x-ray crystallographic analysis to compare the structure of XMIF with that of mammalian MIF. In the crystal structure of XMIF (Fig. 4), one trimer and one monomer were contained in an asymmetric unit, in which MIF formed a trimer around the crystallographic 3-fold axis. Mammalian MIF proteins also exist as a trimer (27Sugimoto H. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nishihira J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Suzuki M. Sugimoto H. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nishihira J. Sakai M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Each monomer contains two α-helices and a four-stranded β-sheet. Two additional β-strands interact with the β-sheets of adjacent subunits. The barrel structure, which contains three β-sheets (one from each monomer), forms the solvent-accessible channel positioned at the center of the trimer. These structural features are conserved in mammalian MIF. The root mean square deviation for main chain atoms between XMIF and human MIF and between XMIF and rat MIF are 0.55 and 1.30 Å, respectively. Expression of XMIF mRNA—RNAs from Xenopus embryos and those from organs of an adult frog were subjected to RT-PCR followed by Southern blot analysis to determine the expression levels of MIF mRNA. Fig. 5A shows the expression of MIF mRNA in embryos at different stages of development. Early embryos contained a substantial amount of maternally expressed MIF mRNA. The mRNA level decreased in the gastrula stage (stage 11) and recovered in the early tailbud stage (stage 20). A high expression level continued through the tail-bud stage. Fig. 5B shows the expression of MIF mRNA in organs of the adult frog. As has been observed in the case of mammalian MIF, XMIF was ubiquitously expressed. Moreover, the expression pattern was similar to that of rat MIF, which is expressed at high levels in the brain and kidney, and at lower levels in the heart, lung, spleen, and liver (34Sakai M. Nishihira J. Hibiya Y. Koyama Y. Nishi S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 33: 439-446PubMed Google Scholar). Using whole mount in situ hybridization, MIF mRNA was detected in the animal pole area at the blastula stage (stage 9) (Fig. 6A). At the gastrula stage (stage 11), expression of MIF mRNA decreased once but a very small amount of the transcript was detected in the deep layer of the dorsal marginal zone (Fig. 6B). When observing the stained embryos without clearing, MIF mRNA was not detected in the superficial layer of the dorsal region at stage 11 (data not shown). At the early neurula stage (stage 13), MIF was obviously detected in the neural plate. The expression level was relatively high in the anterior region (Fig. 6, D and F). At stage 15, MIF was detected in the anterior and posterior regions of the developing neural tissue (Fig. 6, H and I). In the early and late tailbud embryos (stages 26 and 34), intense expression was observed in the head region, including the brain and eye capsules (Fig. 6, K and L). The expression in the posterior region, which was observed at stage 15, was also detected at stage 26, and was not detectable at stage 34. In the late tailbud embryo, a moderate level of expression was observed in the dorsal region (Fig. 6L). Sections of stained embryos at the tailbud stage showed that mesodermal tissues such as head mesenchyme and somites, in addition to the brain, exhibited diffuse MIF signals (data not shown). Knockdown of XMIF Inhibits Neurulation—Because MIF mRNA was detected at high levels in neural tissues, we expected that MIF might play important roles in neural development. Thus, we injected antisense MOs for MIF into two dorsal blastomeres of 4-cell stage embryos, from which neural tissues are derived. We used two MOs for targeting MIF. MO1, which hybridizes to the area including the start codon (-1 to 24), was predicted by the manufacturer to be optimal for blocking the translation of MIF. MO2, which was complementary to a portion of the 5′ UTR (-28 to -4), was used for a rescue experiment, because it hybridizes only to endogenous MIF mRNA, not to co-injected MIF RNA lacking an MIF-derived 5′ leader sequence. We examined the effect of the MIF MOs in an in vitro translation system (Fig. 7). As expected, both MO1 and MO2 inhibited the translation of the full-length MIF RNA. MO1 almost completely blocked the translation at a concentration of 1 μm (Fig. 7, lane 2). In this system, MO2 had a lower targeting efficiency than MO1. With 1 μm MO2, an appreciable amount of MIF protein was synthesized. At 10 μm, MO2 was as effective as 1 μm MO1 (Fig. 7, lanes 4 and 5). Thus these MOs were likely to inhibit the translation of endogenous MIF mRNA in injected embryos, at different efficiencies. MO2, which was designed for co-injection with MIF RNA without its 5′ leader sequence, was shown to have no effect on the translation of that RNA (Fig. 7, lanes 7 and 8). In addition, MO1 and MO2 had no detectable effect on the translation of an RNA unrelated to MIF (EF-1a) (Fig. 7, lanes 9-11). Fig. 8 shows the results of the injection of MO1. In the embryos injected with MO1, early embryogenesis up to gastrulation proceeded normally, but neurulation was completely inhibited, i.e. embryos that had received the injection did not form any trace of a neural plate. These embryos also had severe defects in the head and tail structures, and histological examination showed that they were devoid of neural tissues, resulting in the absence of the brain, spinal cord, eye capsules, and otic vesicles. Although a mass of cells in the anterior dorsal region showed staining similar to that of neural cells (Fig. 8F), they did not form any structure found in normally developed neural tissues. More surprisingly, mesodermal tissues such as the notochord and somites did not form. The disappearance of these structures indicated that both anteroposterior and dorsoventral axis formation were entirely disordered in these embryos. We further confirmed the absence of neural tissues by in situ hybridization of two pan-neural markers, zic-2 and nrp-1. As shown in Fig. 8N, no expression of zic-2 was observed in the MO-injected embryos. Similarly, nrp-1 was not detected (data not shown). These results indicated that the injection of MIF MO inhibited the differentiation of neural precursor cells; in addition, it was found that even the anterior dorsal cells showing neural cell-like staining had not differentiated normally. To examine the specificity of the effect of MIF MO on embryogenesis, we used MO2 and MIF RNA in a rescue experiment. When 9.2 pmol of MO2 (equal to the am"
https://openalex.org/W2082765852,"MEK1, a gene product that regulates cell growth and differentiation, also plays an important role in Golgi breakdown during the cell cycle. We have recently shown that polo-like kinase (Plk3) is Golgi localized and involved in Golgi dynamics during the cell cycle. To study the mode of action of Plk3 in the Golgi fragmentation cascade, we examined functional as well as physical interactions between Plk3 and MEK1/ERKs. In HeLa cells, although a significant amount of Plk3 signals dispersed in a manner similar to those of Golgi during mitosis concentrated Plk3 was detected at spindle poles, which colocalized with phospho-MEKs and phospho-ERKs. Pull-down assays showed that Plk3 physically interacted with MEK1 and ERK2. Nocodazole activated Plk3 and its activation was blocked by MEK-specific inhibitors (PD98059 or U0126). Moreover, transfection of activated MEK1 resulted in an enhanced kinase activity of Plk3; Plk3-induced fragmentation of Golgi stacks was significantly reduced after treatment with MEK inhibitors. Consistently, ectopic expression of activated MEK1, but not kinase-dead MEK1(K97R), stimulated Plk3 to induce Golgi breakdown and the stimulation was not observed in cells expressing Plk3(K52R). Furthermore, PLK3(-/-) murine embryonic fibroblast cells exhibited a significantly less fragmentation of the Golgi complex than that in wild-type cells after exposed to nocodazole. Thus, our studies strongly suggest that Plk3 may be a key protein kinase mediating MEK1 function in the Golgi fragmentation pathway during cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2035689139,"The drs gene was originally isolated as a suppressor against v-src transformation. Expression of drs mRNA was markedly downregulated in a variety of human cancer cell lines and tissues, suggesting that the drs gene acts as a tumor suppressor. In this study, we found that ectopic expression of the Drs protein induced apoptosis in human cancer cell lines. Analyses using deletion mutants of drs revealed that both the C-terminal region and the three consensus repeats in the N-terminal region are essential for the induction of apoptosis. Caspase-12, -9, and -3 were sequentially activated by drs, and specific inhibitors of caspase-3 and -9 suppressed drs-induced apoptosis. The release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm was not observed in apoptosis by drs, suggesting that the mitochondrial pathway does not mediate drs-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that the Drs protein can interact with ASY/Nogo-B/RTN-xS, an apoptosis-inducing protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, and that coexpression of these genes increased the efficiency of apoptosis. These results indicated that Drs induces apoptosis by a novel pathway mediated by ASY/Nogo-B/RTN-xS, caspase-12, -9, and -3."
https://openalex.org/W2011148925,"The interaction between stromal and epithelial cells is critical for the initiation and progression of prostate cancer, but the molecular determinants responsible for the cross-talk between these two cell types remain largely unknown. Here, we used a co-culture cell assay to identify messengers involved in the cross-talk between human prostate stromal PS30 and epithelial LNCaP cells. Stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) activates the mitogenic ERK signaling pathway in PS30, but not LNCaP, cells. The co-culture of PS30 and LNCaP cells results in the activation of ERK in LNCaP cells and that is further increased in response to stimulation with LPA. Physiologic relevance of the interaction between PS30 and LNCaP cells is demonstrated using LNCaP xenograft tumor assays. Animals implanted with a mixture of both cell types develop larger tumors with higher frequency compared with those injected with LNCaP cells alone. Conditioned medium transfer experiments reveal the PS30-derived inducing factor is soluble and promotes mitogenic ERK and STAT3 signaling pathways in LNCaP cells. Protein analysis demonstrates that treatment of the PS30 cells with LPA induces synthesis of interleukin 6 (IL-6).

Prostate cancer is a common disease in aged men. In 2003, an estimated 220,900 American men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 28,900 men died from the disease (1Jemal A. Murray T. Samuels A. Ghafoor A. Ward E. Thun M.J. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2003; 53: 5-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (3363) Google Scholar). Normal and early stage prostate cancer cells require androgen for growth and survival, which led to the formulation and successful application of androgen ablation and anti-androgen therapies as principal treatment modalities for the disease. However, beneficial effects of the hormonal therapies are often temporary, and the cancer invariably progresses to the androgen-refractory stage characterized by recurrent growth and metastasis, predominantly to bone (2Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 3Nelson W.G. De Marzo A.M. Isaacs W.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 366-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Despite decades of intense laboratory and clinical research, to date there is no cure for androgen-refractory prostate cancer.The existence of androgen-independent prostate tumors suggests that release of locally produced and/or circulating growth factors, which work through cellular receptors, can switch the prostate cells from a quiescent to an activated phenotype leading to cellular proliferation. The majority of prostate cancers arise from epithelial cells, and in tissue cultures, epithelial prostate cancer cells produce factors that act in an autocrine fashion to regulate their growth and survival (4Xie Y. Gibbs T.C. Mukhin Y.V. Meier K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32516-32526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Berger A.P. Kofler K. Bektic J. Rogatsch H. Steiner H. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Prostate. 2003; 57: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether autocrine mechanisms are relevant to the progression of prostate cancer in men. It is clear, however, that the cancerous prostate exhibits a morphologically altered stromal compartment (6Cunha G.R. Hayward S.W. Wang Y.Z. Ricke W.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 107: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), implying that stromal cells may actively contribute to the initiation and progression of this common disease (7Sung S.Y. Chung L.W. Differentiation. 2002; 70: 506-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Tuxhorn J.A. McAlhany S.J. Dang T.D. Ayala G.E. Rowley D.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3298-3307PubMed Google Scholar). The understanding of why stromal cells contribute to tumor growth remains incomplete, although a likely explanation is that they secrete growth-stimulating molecules that promote mitogenic activity of recipient epithelial cells. Support for this hypothesis is provided by the finding that in a murine xenograft model, prostate cancer epithelial cells form tumors more rapidly when mixed with stromal cells than when injected alone (9Ayala G. Tuxhorn J.A. Wheeler T.M. Frolov A. Scardino P.T. Ohori M. Wheeler M. Spitler J. Rowley D.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 4792-4801PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known how the stromal cells are activated in the cancerous human prostate and what growth factors they secrete.Recent studies have shown that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; IL-6, interleukin 6; CM, conditioned medium; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; STAT3, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3; BK, bradykinin; ET-1, endothelin 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; AR, androgen receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; IL-6, interleukin 6; CM, conditioned medium; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; STAT3, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3; BK, bradykinin; ET-1, endothelin 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; AR, androgen receptor. and their immediate effectors, the heterotrimeric G proteins, are involved in prostate cancer (10Daaka Y. Science's STKE. 2004; http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2004/re2PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, stimulation of endogenous GPCRs for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), bradykinin (BK), or endothelin 1 (ET-1), for example, induces the growth and survival of prostate cancer cells (11Kue P.F.

Using a prostate cancer xenograft model, we recently demonstrated that inhibition of G protein signaling attenuates the growth of prostate tumors in animals (16Bookout A.L. Finney A.E. Guo R. Peppel K. Koch W.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37569-37573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest the involvement of G proteins and their associated receptors in prostate tumorigenesis.Here, we tested the hypothesis that GPCRs exert their mitogenic effects by regulating the cross-talk between stromal and epithelial prostate cells. We found that stimulation with LPA induced the activation of mitogenic extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK) in human prostate stromal PS30 but not in epithelial LNCaP cells. Conditioned medium (CM) obtained from LPA-stimulated PS30 cells activates ERK and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in LNCaP cells. Protein analysis of CM from LPA-stimulated PS30 cells revealed the secretion of several growth factors, including interleukin 6 (IL-6). Antibody neutralization results demonstrated IL-6 to be the chief factor responsible for LPA-regulated cross-talk between the PS30 and LNCaP cells. Inhibition of IL-6 signaling abrogated PS30-induced mitogenic signaling and growth of LNCaP cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Antibodies were obtained as follows. Anti-human IL-6, anti-phospho-ERK, and anti-phospho-STAT3 were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), anti-ERK2 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). LPA was purchased from Sigma and recombinant human IL-6 from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Cell culture media and supplements were purchased from Invitrogen. All other reagents were standard laboratory grade. The plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP)-ERK2 was the kind gift of Dr. N. W. Bunnett (University of California, San Francisco).Cell Growth and Transfection—Lymph node metastasis human prostate cancer LNCaP cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The PS30 human prostate stromal cell line was established at Duke University as described by Price et al. (17Price D.T. Rudner X. Michelotti G.A. Schwinn D.A. J. Urol. 2000; 164: 2145-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin and cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For growth, the PS30 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates in standard culture medium for 48 h to allow attachment. Serum-free culture medium contained 100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Transient transfection was carried out with 70–80% confluent LNCaP cells using 1,2-dimyristyloxypropyl-3-dimethylhydroxyethyl ammonium bromide (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, the cells were detached with trypsin and equally divided into 6-well culture dishes. The cells were incubated in starvation medium (phenol red-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 12–16 h prior to stimulation with agonist. For LNCaP-PS30 co-culture assays, the cells were mixed and seeded at a ratio of 4:1, LNCaP:PS30 cells.Preparation of CM from Prostate Stromal Cells—PS30 cell monolayers were treated with agonist, or not, in starvation medium for 6 h or 24 h. CM was collected by aspiration, centrifuged to remove cell debris, and stored at 4 °C or -20 °C until further use.ERK and STAT3 Activation—Serum-deprived cells were stimulated with agonist or PS30 CM at 37 °C for the indicated time. Reactions were terminated by direct addition of Laemmli lysis buffer. Equal amounts of protein (20–30 μg/lane) from each sample were separated on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. ERK and STAT3 phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting using phospho-specific ERK and STAT3 antibodies, exactly as described by Kue et al. (12Kue P.F. Taub J.S. Harrington L.B. Polakiewicz R.D. Ullrich A. Daaka Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 102: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated ERK and STAT3 bands were visualized with ECL. Nitrocellulose filters were stripped of immunoglobulins and reprobed with ERK2 or STAT3 antibodies to confirm equal loading of protein.IL-6 Antibody Neutralization—Neutralization of IL-6 in the CM was performed by adding 1 μg/ml of anti-IL-6 antibody for 1 h at 37 °C prior to application onto LNCaP cell monolayers (12Kue P.F.

In control experiments, serum-free medium containing IL-6 was similarly exposed to the IL-6-neutralizing antibody. Another control included the treatment of PS30 cells with isotype-matched nonspecific antibodies. The monolayers were directly lysed in Laemmli sample buffer and prepared for immunoblotting as described (16Bookout A.L. Finney A.E. Guo R. Peppel K. Koch W.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37569-37573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Xenograft Tumor Growth—Tumor formation and growth were assessed using subcutaneous injection in intact animals as described by Bookout et al.

Briefly, a mixture of LNCaP (1 × 105) and PS30 (2.5 × 105) cells was resuspended in 50 μl of culture medium and 50 μl of Matrigel (Collaborative Biosciences, Bedford, MA) and injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 6–8-week-old Balb/c athymic mice. Control samples included the injection of individual LNCaP (1 × 105) or PS30 (2.5 × 105) cells with Matrigel. Tumor growth was measured weekly with calipers, and tumor volume was determined using the formula v = π/6 × (larger diameter) × (small diameter)2. Each experiment consisted of 5 mice/group and was repeated two times. All animal experiments were done in accordance with the regulations of the Animal Institutional Review Board at Duke University.Cytokine Array—Seventy-nine cytokines were assayed using the Human Cytokine Array 5.1 (Ray Biotech, Norcross, GA). Membranes were exposed to blocking buffer and incubated with LPA-induced CM or control medium for 2 h. The membranes were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions.Cell Proliferation—LNCaP cells were detached with trypsin and diluted to 2.5 × 104 cells/ml in CM from LPA-treated, or not, PS30 cells. The cells were seeded into 6-well plates and allowed to grow for 5 days. Cell numbers were determined by counting viable cells using trypan blue exclusion and a hemocytometer (14Barki-Harrington L.

J. 2003; 371: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).RESULTSLPA Regulates the Cross-talk between PS30 and LNCaP Cells—Stimulation of human prostate stromal PS30 cells with LPA or BK (Fig. 1A) and ET-1 or EGF (Fig. 1B) induced the time-dependent phosphorylation of ERK. The magnitude of ERK activation by LPA, BK, and ET-1 was similar to that achieved in response to stimulation with EGF, demonstrating that these GPCR ligands exert a potent mitogenic response. Maximal activation of ERK was achieved within 5 min of GPCR stimulation and was sustained for about 30 min. Distinctly, stimulation of the androgen-dependent epithelial human prostate cancer LNCaP cells with the GPCR ligands did not promote the ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Stimulation with EGF, used as positive control, induced the robust ERK phosphorylation in the LNCaP cells. These results demonstrate that stimulation with LPA, BK, and ET-1 activates ERK in stromal PS30 but not epithelial LNCaP prostate cells.We took advantage of these observations to study the possible interaction between stromal and epithelial prostate cells with emphasis on the potential regulatory role of GPCRs. In the prostate gland, stromal cells may influence growth of epithelial cells either directly through physical contact between the two cell types or indirectly by secreting a soluble mediator. To explore these options, we examined ERK activation in a stromal-epithelial cell co-culture model system, using wild type PS30 cells and LNCaP cells stably expressing GFP fused to ERK2 (GFP-ERK2; Fig. 2A). Stimulation of the co-cultured cells with LPA induced the time-dependent increase in ERK phosphorylation in both cell types. LPA treatment induced maximal phosphorylation signal of the GFP-ERK2 in the LNCaP cells after 5 min of stimulation, returning to basal level within 30 min (Fig. 2B). A second peak of phosphorylated ERK appeared after 30 min of LPA stimulation and was sustained for at least 60 min. The time course of ERK phosphorylation in the PS30 cells reached a maximum at 5–10 min before it began to decrease (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the PS30, unlike LNCaP, cells did not show a secondary LPA-stimulated ERK phosphorylation peak. Direct stimulation of the GFP-ERK2-transfected LNCaP cells with LPA did not promote the ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Stimulation with EGF, used as positive control, promoted the robust phosphorylation of GFP-ERK2 and endogenous ERK (Fig. 2C). These data are consistent with the idea that stromal prostate cells promote mitogenic signaling in epithelial prostate cancer cells and that GPCR activation could enhance the mitogenic response.Fig. 2LPA regulates the cross-talk between PS30 and LNCaP cells. A, representative microscopy image of co-cultured PS30 and LNCaP-GFP-ERK2 cells. B, LPA regulates ERK activation in LNCaP cells stably expressing GFP-ERK2 co-cultured with PS30 cells. Serumstarved co-cultured PS30 and LNCaP cells were stimulated with LPA (10 μm) for the indicated time or with EGF (10 ng/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C. Data are expressed as -fold ERK phosphorylation, in which the ERK phosphorylation produced in each unstimulated cell type was defined as 1.0. Values represent means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. The immunoblot represents phospho-ERK (P-ERK) from a single representative experiment. NS, not stimulated. C, LPA does not activate ERK in LNCaP cells stably expressing GFP-ERK2. Serum-starved cells were treated with LPA (10 μm) or EGF (10 ng/ml) as in Fig. 2B. D, CM from GPCR-stimulated PS30 cells induces ERK activation in LNCaP cells. PS30 cells were treated with LPA (10 μm), BK (50 nm), ET-1 (50 nm), or EGF (10 ng/ml) for 6 h followed by collection of the CM. The CM was applied onto serum-starved LNCaP cells for the indicated time at 37 °C. In all cases, the cell lysates were analyzed for phosphorylated ERK by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-ERK antibodies. Results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of Prostate Stromal CM on Epithelial Cells—To further characterize the factor(s) responsible for the cross-talk between the stromal and epithelial prostate cells, PS30 cells were stimulated with LPA, BK, or ET-1 followed by the collection of CM. The CM was clarified by centrifugation and added onto the LNCaP cells to determine ERK activation. Exposure of the LNCaP cells to the CM induced the time-regulated phosphorylation of ERK with the signal appearing after 30 min of stimulation (Fig. 2D). Thus, the cross-talk between stromal and epithelial prostate cells is mediated by a soluble factor(s) that is secreted in response to stimulating G protein-coupled receptors endogenously expressed in the stromal cells.PS30 Cells Accelerate Formation of LNCaP Tumors—To investigate the possible physiologic impact of the cross-talk between the PS30 and LNCaP cells, we tested the hypothesis that co-inoculation of both cell types influences the frequency of tumor formation as well as tumor size in athymic mice. Fig. 3 shows that tumor take, defined as the number of formed tumors per total injections, was consistently higher in the animals receiving the LNCaP-PS30 cell mixture compared with animals receiving LNCaP cells alone (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the tumor size was larger when LNCaP cells were mixed with the PS30 cells, compared with LNCaP-alone tumors (Fig. 3B). Histologic tests revealed the tumors obtained from inoculating PS30-LNCaP cells resulted from increased growth of the LNCaP cells (and not the PS30 cells) and displayed increased blood vessel formation compared with tumors obtained from inoculating LNCaP cells alone. These results reinforce the idea that stromal prostate cells contribute to the growth of epithelial prostate cancer cells.Fig. 3Effect of PS30 cells on the formation of LNCaP tumors in mice. LNCaP cells (1.0 × 105) alone or together with PS30 (2.5 × 105) cells were injected subcutaneously with Matrigel into the flanks of 6–8-week-old Balb/c athymic mice. The graphs show: A, tumor take, defined as the fraction of tumors formed per total injections and B, mean tumor volume, measured using calipers and calculated using the formula, v = π/6 × (long dimension) × (short dimension)2. Shown are curves representing the average tumor take (A) and tumor size (B) of 10 mice for each of the LNCaP-PS30 and LNCaP alone groups.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Identification of Factors in Stromal Cell CM—Initial attempts to identify secreted PS30 factors were carried out by analyzing protein bands (one-dimensional gel) and spots (two-dimensional gel) using peptide mass fingerprinting and mass spectrometry. Data base searches identified many proteins, but none had growth-promoting characteristics (data not shown), suggesting our proteomic approach may be limited for the detection of low abundance mitogenic factors.We used growth factor/cytokine array analysis as an alternative approach to identify the growth factor(s) present in the PS30 CM. Fig. 4A lists the various cytokines and peptide growth factors spotted on the filter. Fig. 4B shows the immunoreactivity of the cytokines and growth factors present in the CM obtained from LPA-treated, or not, PS30 cells. The array spots were analyzed by Scan-Analyze, and the intensity of each spot was compared with respective spots in the control array. Levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Fig. 4A, GM-CSF), growth-related oncogene (GRO), IL-6, -8, and -16, oncostatin M (OSM), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factors 4 and 9 (FGF4, FGF9), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins 2 and 4 (IGFBP2 and -4), interferon γ-inducible protein 10 (IP10), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and transforming growth factor β2 (TGFβ2) were all significantly increased in the LPA-treated (compared with unstimulated) samples (Fig. 4B). We validated the cytokine array results by determining the levels of secreted IL-6 using Western blot analysis. CM obtained from PS30 cells treated with LPA for 24 h showed 2–3-fold higher levels of IL-6 compared with the control CM (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4LPA regulates secretion of IL-6 from PS30 cells. A, human growth factor/cytokine array map showing the growth factors and cytokines spotted on the filter. B, detection of multiple factors expressed in conditioned medium from LPA-stimulated and nonstimulated PS30 cells. The membrane was incubated with CM and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, LPA increases the expression of IL-6 in PS30 CM. Serum-starved PS30 cells were treated with LPA (10 μm) for 24 h followed by the collection of CM. Proteins were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, separated on 4–20% SDS-PAGE, and probed for IL-6 expression by immunoblotting. Purified recombinant human IL-6 (rIL6) was used as a control. Immunoblots are representative of three independent experiments. NS, not stimulated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)IL-6 Mediates LPA-regulated Cross-talk between PS30 and LNCaP Cells—Our results show that CM from LPA-stimulated PS30 cells induced ERK activation in the LNCaP cells (Fig. 2D) and contained IL-6 (Fig. 4, B and C). We tested whether IL-6 is the CM-expressed growth factor responsible for ERK activation in the LNCaP cells. CM was mixed with 1 μg/ml neutralizing IL-6 antibodies for 1 h prior to application onto the LNCaP cells to assay ERK and STAT3 phosphorylation. Results show that neutralization of IL-6 was dramatically reduced but did not totally eliminate the CM-induced ERK activation (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that other growth factors may be present in the CM and contribute to ERK phosphorylation. On the other hand, neutralizing the IL-6 activity obliterated the CM-induced STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that IL-6 is the chief CM-expressed factor responsible for STAT3 activation. Direct stimulation with IL-6, used as a positive control, induced the ERK and STAT3 activation. As expected, the IL-6-induced ERK and STAT3 phosphorylation was inhibited in the presence of IL-6-neutralizing antibodies. Together, these results suggest that IL-6 is a major mitogenic growth factor secreted from PS30 cells in response to stimulation with the GPCR ligand LPA.Fig. 5Effect of IL-6-neutralizing antibodies on CM-induced ERK and STAT3 activation in LNCaP cells. CM obtained from LPA-stimulated PS30 cells were mixed with IL-6-neutralizing antibodies for 1 h prior to the addition to serum-starved LNCaP cells for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antiphospho-ERK (P-ERK; upper panel in A) or anti-phospho-STAT3 (upper panel in B) antibodies. The filters were stripped of immunoglobulins and reprobed using anti-ERK2 (lower panel in A) or STAT3 (lower panel in B) antibodies to demonstrate equal loading of proteins. Data shown are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In Vitro Effects of CM on Epithelial Cell Growth—To further implicate the effect of stromal factors on LNCaP cell growth, we used CM collected from PS30 cells pretreated, or not, with LPA. The LNCaP cells were exposed to the CM for 48 h before cell numbers were determined. Fig. 6 shows that CM from LPA-treated PS30 cells supported the growth of LNCaP cells; about 2-fold increase compared with nonstimulated PS30 CM. Importantly, the CM-mediated LNCaP cell growth was attenuated in the presence of IL-6-neutralizing antibodies. However, the nonstimulated PS30 CM still induced LNCaP cell growth compared with cells cultured in starvation medium. Together, these results suggest that IL-6 mediates, at least in part, the LPA-regulated cross-talk between PS30 and LNCaP prostate cells to promote cell growth.Fig. 6PS30 CM induces the IL-6-dependent LNCaP cell growth. CM collected from PS30 cells stimulated, or not, with LPA (10 μm) for 6 h. CM was mixed, or not, with IL-6-neutralizing antibody for 1 h prior to the addition to serum-starved LNCaP cells. The cells were cultured for 5 days, harvested, and stained with trypan blue. The cells excluding the dye were counted under light microscopy with a hemocytometer.

Science's STKE. 2004; http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2004/re2PubMed Google Scholar). The GPCRs may perform this function by (i) increasing the gene expression of growth factors (18Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The major finding of this study was that activation of GPCRs expressed in prostate stromal cells induced the secretion of factors that promoted mitogenic signaling of prostate epithelial cells. Hence, GPCRs regulate the cross-talk between stromal and epithelial prostate cells, which plays an important role in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer (6Cunha G.R. Hayward S.W.

In a mammalian cell line, wild type bovine cone photoreceptor channel α subunits (bCNGA3) convert from an unglycosylated state, at 90 kDa, to two glycosylated states at 93 and 102 kDa as they transit within the cell to their final location at the plasma membrane.

Whereas specific details of CNG protein cellular processing have previously not been reported, it is likely these channels follow the cellular processing pattern typical of other channel proteins (reviewed in Ref. 7Deutsch C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 19-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Nascent channel proteins first attach to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, targeted to these membranes by a signal sequence. In the ER, proteins fold and translocate across the lipid bilayer and are core glycosylated by linking of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to Asn residues in the consensus sequence NX-S or-T. Frequently, core-glycosylated channel proteins are processed by additional glycosylation in the ER and/or Golgi apparatus.Various single point mutations in the α subunit of CNG channels of cone photoreceptors have been identified in humans afflicted by achromatopsia, also known as total color blindness or rod monochromic, an autosomal, inherited disease characterized by complete loss of cone photoreceptor function (8Wissinger B.

Two of the most frequent mutant alleles in achromatopsia are mutations from charged to neutral amino acids in the S4 structural motif of the cone-specific CNG channel α subunit (CNGA3) (8Wissinger B.

In addition to its biophysical function, however, the S4 structure also plays a role in the cellular biogenesis of voltage-gated channels (for review see Refs. 7Deutsch C. Annu. Rev.

In voltage-gated K+ channels, neutralization of some charged amino acid residues in S4 change the voltage dependence of gating, whereas mutation of others cause channel functional failure (23Papazian D.M.

Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2000; 39: 824-836Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In HCN channels, which are gated by voltage and modulated by cyclic nucleotides, S4 plays a similar dual role: some residues affect the voltage dependence in gating, whereas others interfere with their arrival at the plasma membrane (19Mannikko R. Elinder F. Larsson H.P. Nature. 2002; 419: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 26Chen J. Mitcheson J.S. Lin M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36465-36471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Although CNG channels contain an S4 domain they are not voltage-gated. That is, their probability of opening is independent of membrane voltage and depends only on cyclic nucleotide concentration. This is despite the fact that the CNG channels' S4 domain can perform as a voltage sensor when placed in a permissive structural environment. Chimera experiments demonstrate that replacing the authentic S4 motif in ether-ago-go K+ channel with the olfactory S4 motif (CNGA2) maintains the voltage-dependent behavior of the K+ channel (27Tang C.Y. Papazian D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CNG channels do exhibit several voltage-dependent functions. 1) The ligand sensitivity is voltage dependent. The ligand concentration necessary to half-maximally activate the channels is about 10 μm higher when measured at -50 mV than at +50 mV (in cones 28Picones A. Korenbrot J.I. J. Gen.

(Lond.). 1992; 449: 759-783Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 2) The lifetime of the channel open state in rod CNG is slightly longer at depolarized than at hyperpolarized voltages, causing slight outward rectification in the open channel I-V curve (30Benndorf K. Koopmann R. Eismann E. Kaupp U.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 3) Open channels are blocked by divalent cations, but the extent of block is voltage-dependent: block is relieved as the voltage moves away from the reversal voltage (in cones 31Picones A.

To explore the role of S4 in CNG channel function, we investigated the consequences of point mutations in the S4 domain of the CNG channel α subunit cloned from bovine cone photoreceptors (bCNGA3). We measured the electrical properties of transfected mammalian cells, as well as the cell-processing and expression patterns of the channel proteins. We have found that normal channels exist in various states of glycosylation as they transit within cells to the plasma membrane. S4 plays a crucial role in channel biogenesis. Specific, not all, point mutations in S4 cause failure of cellular channel protein processing. Mutant channel proteins are not glycosylated and do not reach the surface plasma membrane; they remain trapped within the endoplasmic reticulum, likely misfolded.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis and Hemagglutinin (HA) Tag Insertion— The cDNA of bovine CNGA3 (accession NM_174279, Refs. 36Weyand I.

Biel (University of Munich). The cDNA was inserted in-frame with the cytomegalovirus promoter in a bacterial plasmid (pcDNA 3, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA was executed using the QuikChange® kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA).To track cellular processing of bCNGA3 we tagged the protein with HA peptide (YPYDVPDYA) by inserting the coding sequence of the peptide in-frame with the channel sequence at three specific locations using the QuikChange kit. 1) bCNGA3-N-HA in the amino terminus, between Leu32 and Ser33. 2) bCNGA3-C-HA in the carboxyl terminus, between Pro699 and Gln700 (seven residues from the end of the protein). 3) bCNGA3-S1S2-HA in the extracellular loop that connects transmembrane helices S1 and S2, between residues Leu214 and Gln215. All mutants and chimeras were sequenced in full to ensure that unintended, random mutations did not occur because of polymerase errors.Cell Transfection—tsA-201 cells (transformed from HEK 293 cells to constitutively expressing T-antigen) were grown on plastic wells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's H-21 media (with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. When they reached 70% confluence they were transfected with plasmid cDNA introduced as a calcium phosphate precipitate using a commercial kit (Specialty Media, Phillipsburg, NJ). 9.6-cm2 wells were simultaneously transfected with 12.5 μg of channel cDNA plasmid and 3 μg of pEGFP, a pcDNA 3 plasmid that promotes cytoplasmic expression of EGFP. 20 h later the DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate was washed away. Cells were cultured for another 48 h before subjecting them to electrophysiological, biochemical, or imaging studies.Electrophysiological Measurements—Cells were suspended in a simple Ringer's solution consisting of (in mm): NaCl (140), KCl (2.5), NaHCO3 (3.5), Na2HPO4 (1), CaCl2 (1), MgCl2 (1), glucose (10), minimal essential medium amino acids and vitamins (1×), and HEPES (10), pH 7.4, osmotic pressure: 310 mosmol. To produce these suspensions, cell layers growing on plastic were gently trypsinized (0.05% trypsin, 0.02% Versene), washed, and maintained in Ringer's solution at 4 °C for at least 30 min and for as long as 6 h.About 60,000 cells in 200 μl were plated on a poly-l-lysine-coated (0.1 mg/ml) glass coverslip that formed the bottom of an electrophysiological recording chamber. The chamber was held on the stage of a modified upright microscope that permitted observation of the cells with DIC contrast enhancement under deep red light illumination, as described in detail elsewhere (38Ohyama T. Hackos D.H. Frings S. Hagen V. Kaupp U.B. Korenbrot J.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 735-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The microscope was equipped with a high-resolution, cooled CCD camera and follow up hardware and software (MicroMax1300 and WinView32, Roper Scientific). The microscope included two epi-illumination pathways. One permitted us to select EGFP-expressing cells by their fluorescence under appropriate spectral filters, whereas the second allowed the delivery of bright, brief flashes of light to the cell under investigation. These flashes were generated by a Xenon arc flash lamp (200 Joules, 170-μs half-bandwidth) (Chadwick-Helmuth Co., El Monte, CA).All experiments were conducted at room temperature (20-21 °C). After identifying an EGFP-expressing cell, tight-seal electrodes were applied onto the cell under deep red light (to avoid uncaging). Electrodes were produced from alumino silicate glass (1724, 1.5 × 1.0 mm outer diameter × inner diameter, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). We measured membrane currents under voltage-clamp with a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 1D, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Analog signals were low pass filtered below 100 Hz with an eight pole Bessel filter (Kronh-Hite, Avon, MA) and digitized on line at 200 Hz (pClamp, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA).Electrode filling solution was freshly prepared under dim red light and used within 3 h or discarded. We used a salt solution consisting of (in mm): gluconic acid (130), triethanolamine-Cl (20), HEPES (10), MgCl2 (3.7), GTPNa3 (1), ATPNa2 (2), 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxyl)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (2) titrated to pH 7.3 with CsOH. Under deep red light we added MCM-caged 8-pCPT-cGMP ((7-methoxycoumarin-methyl-4-yl) methyl-caged 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine cyclic 3′,5′-monophosphate)) from a 25 mm in Me2SO stock to a final concentration of 15 μm. The compound was the kind gift of Dr. V. Hagen, who has described its synthesis (39Hagen V. Bendig J. Frings S. Wiesner B. Schade B. Helm S. Lorenz D. Kaupp U.B. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1999; 53: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Immunoblot Analysis of HA-tagged Channel Proteins—Transfected cells were lysed with non-denaturing lysis buffer: 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 tablet/10 ml of solution of a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). 25-μg samples of total protein were separated by size using SDS-PAGE on 6% gels, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by semidry electroblotting. Membranes were incubated overnight in blocking buffer: 100 mm phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dried milk, and 1% goat serum at 4 °C with continuous agitation. They were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 15 ml of the same buffer, now containing anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody at 100 ng/ml (3F10 clone, Roche Applied Science). Bound primary antibody was detected by reaction with a secondary anti-rat goat antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 in blocking buffer) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Horseradish activity was exposed either with diaminobenzidine and nickel substrate or with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were repeated at least three times.Immunocytochemistry—In these experiments tsA-201 cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated (1 mg/ml) glass number 1 coverslips placed in plastic wells. Cells were grown on 2-cm2 wells and transformed with plasmid DNA scaled in concentration to maintain the weight ratios described above for cells grown on larger wells. 48 h after washing away the DNA-calcium-phosphate precipitate, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline, and then blocked by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 2% goat serum for at least 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then incubated overnight with anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody at 200 ng/ml added to the blocking solution (3F10 clone). The anti-HA antibody was detected with a fluorescent secondary goat antibody conjugated with rhodamine (1:500) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Glass coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and the edges sealed with rubber cement.Specific Membrane Compartment Labeling of Transformed Cells— Cells grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in 2-cm2 wells were simultaneously transfected with channel cDNA (2.6 μg) and 0.65 μg each of one of several DNA constructs designed to express EGFP fusion protein at specific subcellular compartments.To label the plasma membrane we transformed cells with pEGFP-F plasmid (BD Biosciences, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). This construct promotes the expression of a farnesylation signal in fusion with EGFP, the protein product is palmitoylated and targeted specifically to the cell plasma membrane. To label the endoplasmic reticulum we transformed cells with pEGFP-ER, a construct consisting of the residues -30 to 8 of bovine preprolactin (40Sasavage N.L. Nilson J.H. Horowitz S. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 678-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in fusion with EGFP. To label Golgi apparatus we transformed with pEGFP-TG, a construct consisting of residues -77 to -31 of human β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (41Masri K.A. Appert H.E. Fukuda M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) in fusion with EGFP. The later two constructs were the kind gift of Dr. A. Verkman (University of California, San Francisco), who has described their construction and application (42Kneen M. Farinas J. Li Y. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1591-1599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar).Microscopy and Image Analysis—Fluorescent cell images were captured with a confocal microscope (Zeiss, model LSM 510) using a ×63/1.3 NA objective. Spatial resolution was further improved by deblurring the confocal images with the use of deconvolution algorithms (C-Imaging Systems, Compix Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). The same software was used for image analysis and overlay in pixel-by-pixel operations at 12 bit resolution.RESULTSWe investigated the electrical properties and cellular protein processing of the bCNGA3. Electrical function was assayed in transformed tsA-201 cells by assessing whether, under voltage clamp, membrane currents were activated upon photo release of cyclic nucleotide from a caged precursor compound. The analog we used, 8-pCPT-cGMP is the most potent CNG channel agonist so far described (about 80-fold higher than cGMP (43Wei J.Y. Cohen E.D. Genieser H.G. Barnstable C.J. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)), thus yielding a highly sensitive assay of function. Caged nucleotide was loaded into cells by allowing time for its diffusion from the lumen of a tight-seal electrode into the cell cytoplasm. Typically, the effect of photoreleased 8-pCPT-cGMP was assessed 3.5 min after attaining the whole cell mode, a time sufficient for equilibration between the cytoplasm of the cell and electrode filling solution. At this time, cells transformed with wt α subunits of bCNGA3 exhibited a mean holding current at -40 mV of -14.3 ± 17.6 pA (n = 22). Because endogenous K+ channels in tsA-201 were partially blocked by the ionic solutions we used in these experiments, holding current magnitude principally reflects cell integrity and the quality of the seal resistance and offers an excellent tool to discard damaged cells. Indeed, cells were accepted for analysis only if their holding current was within the statistical range reported above.Uncaging pCPT-cGMP by bright flash illumination caused a large inward current at -75 mV in cells transfected with wt bCNGA3 (Fig. 1A). In cells tested at holding voltages between -65 and -25 mV, 27 of 29 exhibited uncaging flash-activated currents. The few failures almost certainly reflect cells in which EGFP was expressed (the criterion to identify transformed cells), but channels were not. The absolute amplitude of the current varied from cell to cell, likely reflecting variance in the level of channel protein expression. At -75 mV mean cyclic nucleotide-dependent current amplitude was -74 ± 50.5 (range -36 to -170, n = 6).Three independent controls make evident that the current generated by uncaging the cyclic nucleotide analog reflects specific activation of bCNGA3 channels. 1) Flash illumination of transformed cells not loaded with caged nucleotides or untransformed cells loaded with the nucleotides did not generate currents. 2) The I-V characteristics of the flash-activated current are the same as those of the native cone CNG channels under similar ionic solutions (Fig. 1D). The composition of intra- and extracellular solutions were designed to minimize the amplitude of small delayed rectifier K+ and Ca2+-dependent Cl- currents endogenous to tsA-201 cells. The 8-pCPT-cGMP-dependent difference I-V curve is typical of CNGA3 channels and demonstrates the well documented voltage-dependent relief of channel blocking by divalent cations. 3) Currents were of identical features whether activated by uncaging caged-8-pCPT-cGMP or caged-cGMP (not shown).Functional Consequence of Various Point Mutations in S4—We transformed cells with bCNGA3 cDNA modified to mutate R296Q, this is the second Arg in the S4 motif of the channel (Table I). In these cells the holding current at -40 mV was -9.6 ± 9.6 pA (n = 10). None of these cells exhibited detectable changes in current upon cytoplasmic flash release of cyclic nucleotides (Fig. 1B). The failure of functional channel expression is specifically because of the point mutation, because cells transformed with the very same plasmid mutated back to the wt sequence resulted in electrical behavior identical to that of wt channels (Fig. 1C). In cells transformed with revertant Q296R cDNA, the holding current at -40 mV was -5.6 ± 3.7 pA and peak uncaging flash-generated current at -75 mV was -59.3 ± 36.8 pA (range -20 to -96 pA, n = 3). That is, our mutagenesis protocol introduced the designed point mutations in S4 without causing unintended changes in the cDNA and neutralizing the charge of one specific amino acid in S4 caused failure of functional channel expression.Table IElectrophysiological characterization of the consequence of point mutations in S4 in cone bCNGA3 ion channels and its tagged derivative bCNGA3-C-HAPositionCOOH-taggedMutationI hold at −40 mVΔI flash at −75 mVRangeResponsive/total cellsaCounting cells transformed with wt bCNGA3 and tested at voltages other than −75 mV, 27/29 EGFP-positive cells exhibited currents upon flash release of pCPT-cGMP.pAwt−6.8 ± 6.4−74.0 ± 50.5−36 to −1706/7wtHA−13.8 ± 13.9−84.6 ± 94−15 to −28011/11Arg293Gln−11.3 ± 10.100/4Arg293HAGln−5.0 ± 3.500/4Phe294Leu, Ala−12.1 ± 11.1−119.3 ± 143.4−28 to −4006/7Asn295Gln−10.7 ± 8.400/7Arg296Gln−9.6 ± 9.600/10Arg296HAGln-6.0 ± 0.800/4Arg296CysbSame mutations as found in congenital achromatopsia.−10.6 ± 4.500/3Arg296HACys−3.0 ± 1.000/5Leu297Ala−7.4 ± 9.400/8Lys299Gln−30 ± 2200/2Lys299HAGln−11.5 ± 16.900/4Leu300Phe−7.8 ± 6.1−54.4 ± 26.9−16 to −905/6Arg302TrpbSame mutations as found in congenital achromatopsia.−600/1Arg302HATrp−9.6 ± 5.500/5Arg302HAGln−7.0 ± 2.600/6Leu303Ala−9.6 ± 7.4−103 ± 61.8−34 to −1775/5a Counting cells transformed with wt bCNGA3 and tested at voltages other than −75 mV, 27/29 EGFP-positive cells exhibited currents upon flash release of pCPT-cGMP.b Same mutations as found in congenital achromatopsia.

https://openalex.org/W2034081887,"Because β-catenin target genes such as cyclin D1 are involved in cell cycle progression, we examined whether β-catenin has a more pervasive role in normal cell proliferation, even upon stimulation by non-Wnt ligands. Here, we demonstrate that epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (Tcf/Lef) transcriptional activity in nontransformed mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A) and that its transcriptional activity is essential for EGF-mediated progression through G1/S phase. Thus, expression of dominant-negative Tcf4 blocks EGF-mediated Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and bromodeoxyuridine uptake. In fact, the importance of EGF-mediated Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity for cell cycle progression may lie further upstream at the G1/S phase transition. We demonstrate that dominant-negative Tcf4 inhibits a reporter of cyclin D1 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, dominant-negative Tcf4 suppresses EGF-mediated cell cycle activity specifically by thwarting EGF-mediated Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity, not by broader effects on EGF signaling. Thus, although expression of dominant-negative Tcf4 blocks EGF-mediated TOPFLASH activation, it has no effect on either EGF receptor or ERK phosphorylation, further underscoring the fact that Tcf/Lef-mediated transcription is essential for cell cycle progression, even when other pro-mitogenic signals are at normal levels. Yet, despite its essential role, Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity alone is not sufficient for cell cycle progression. Serum also stimulates Tcf/Lef transcriptional activation in MCF-10A cells but is unable to promote DNA synthesis. Taken together, our data support a model wherein EGF promotes Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity, and this signal is essential but not sufficient for cell cycle activity.

These functions are tightly regulated through its association with various proteins such as the transmembrane protein E-cadherin and Tcf/Lef 1The abbreviations used are: Tcf/Lef, T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2′-phenylindole-dihydrochrolide; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein. transcription factors (1Hulsken J.

Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is a major constituent of adherens junctions where it promotes epithelial cell-cell contact through homotypic interactions mediated by its extracellular domain (3Steinberg M.S. McNutt P.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, its cytoplasmic domain binds to β-catenin, whose association with α-catenin and other structural proteins bridges E-cadherin-mediated contacts to the actin cytoskeleton (4Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition to regulation by sequestration to the plasma membrane, β-catenin is tightly regulated by cytosolic degradation via a multiprotein complex consisting of Axin, APC, and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (5Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genetics Dev. 1999; 9: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Signaling events that inhibit this cytosolic degradation machinery, such as those initiated by a subset of Wnt family ligands, help to stabilize β-catenin, which then translocates to the nucleus where it serves as a transactivator for the Tcf/Lef family of transcription factors. Mutations that abnormally stabilize β-catenin occur in a diverse range of cancer types. In colorectal carcinomas and melanomas, these mutations include the loss and/or truncation of APC or mutations among critical N-terminal serine residues of β-catenin whose phosphorylation flags it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (5Polakis P.

Evidence of β-catenin stabilization has also been shown in hepatomas and prostate cancers wherein loss of axin and PTEN, respectively, leads to accumulation of nuclear β-catenin and increased Tcf/Lef-mediated transcription (8Persad S. Troussard A. McPhee T. Mulholland D. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 9Satoh S. Daigo Y. Furukawa Y. Kato T. Miwa N. Nishiwaki T. Kawasoe T.

In the mammary gland, transgenic expression of Wnt family ligands induces mammary adenocarcinomas in mice (10Tsukamoto A.S. Grosschedl R. Guzman R.C. Parslow T. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, mammary tissue-specific overexpression of a constitutively stable β-catenin mutant induces hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma in the mammary gland (11Michaelson J.S. Leder P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5093-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Finally, studies using stabilized mutants of β-catenin or Tcf/Lef-VP16 fusion constructs have affirmed the capacity of this signaling pathway to transform established cell lines and primary cells (12Aoki M. Hecht A. Kruse U. Kemler R. Vogt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Kolligs F. Hu G. Dang C. Fearon E. Mol.

In fact, antagonizing β-catenin signaling appears to be an effective method to curb the growth of cancer cell lines afflicted by elevated levels of nuclear β-catenin. Exogenous expression of APC, axin, or PTEN reinstates β-catenin turnover and suppresses growth of hepatocellular and prostate carcinoma cells (8Persad S. Troussard A. McPhee T. Mulholland D. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 9Satoh S. Daigo Y. Furukawa Y. Kato T. Miwa N. Nishiwaki T. Kawasoe T. Ishiguro H. Fujita M. Tokino T.

Dominguez D. Baulida J. de Herreros A. Dedhar S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of proteins, such as full-length E-cadherin or a truncated mutant possessing just the C-terminal β/γ-catenin-binding domain, sequesters stabilized β-catenin, precludes its association with Tcf/Lef transcription factors, and effectively inhibits proliferation of colorectal cancer cell lines (16Sadot E.

Although the transformation potential of β-catenin has been closely examined, the role of β-catenin and Tcf/Lef transcription factors in cell cycle progression among normal mammalian cells is beginning to emerge. Immunohistochemical data have shown that self-propagating precursor cells in the intervillus regions of the small intestine epithelium, but not the well differentiated cells at the villi tip, exhibit nuclear β-catenin and express several Tcf/Lef target genes, including c-myc and CD44 (19van de Wetering M.

In addition, Tcf4 knock-out mice lack proliferating stem cells and possess only differentiated villus cells, suggesting a causal role for Tcf/Lef in governing stem cell lineage commitment (20Korinek V.

However, the ligand(s) implicated in stimulating Tcf/Lef signaling and dictating stem cell fate are largely unknown, although Wnt is clearly involved in some instances (26Reya T. Duncan A.W. Ailles L. Domen J. Scherer D.C. Willert K. Hintz L. Nusse R. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar, 28Pinto D. Gregorieff A. Begthel H. Clevers H. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether non-Wnt ligands also utilize the Tcf/Lef pathway to regulate proliferation. Recently, a correlation between serum-mediated proliferation and Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity has been suggested in a study using an engineered mammary cell system (29Stockinger A. Eger A. Wolf J. Beug H. Foisner R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These cells express a c-Fosestradiol receptor fusion protein that permits switching from epithelial to fibroblastoid phenotype upon estradiol-mediated activation of c-Fos (30Eger A. Stockinger A. Schaffhauser B. Beug H. Foisner R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In both phenotypes, conditions that inhibited proliferation such as serum starvation also down-regulated β-catenin transcriptional activity. However, a causal role for β-catenin in serum-induced cell cycle progression was not clearly established in the epithelial cell phenotype. Taken together, inducible activation of c-Fos, which is a component of the AP-1 transcriptional machinery and itself critically involved in cell cycle control (31Cook S.J. Aziz N. McMahon M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and the inability of β-catenin suppression to consistently inhibit proliferation preclude an assessment of whether β-catenin nuclear activity is mechanistically involved in proliferation. Interestingly, several reports have indicated that specific growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor I and insulin induce β-catenin transcriptional activity (32Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Eggelpoel M. Bertrand F. Cherqui G. Perret C. Capeau J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Although these studies were conducted with cancer cell lines lacking normal β-catenin degradation machinery, HGF and certain members of the Wnt family of ligands induce β-catenin transcriptional activity in normal cells (33Monga S.P.S. Mars W.M. Pediaditakis P. Bell A. Mulé K. Bowen W.C. Wang X. Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2064-2071PubMed Google Scholar, 34Papkoff J. Aikawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although the importance of HGF-mediated β-catenin signaling for normal cell cycle progression has not been examined, certain members of the Wnt family of ligands regulate proliferation in a β-catenin-dependent manner (35Young C. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Kitajewski J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 2474-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, because β-catenin target genes include c-myc and cyclin D1, whose protein products are ubiquitously crucial for cell cycle progression (36Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar, 37Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1603-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), the untested hypothesis remains that β-catenin has a more pervasive role in normal epithelial cell proliferation, even in response to growth-stimulating cues from non-Wnt ligands. We examined this hypothesis pertaining to the role of β-catenin in cell cycle progression in the normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. We demonstrate that EGF stimulates Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and that this transcriptional activity is necessary but not sufficient for cell cycle progression of normal epithelial cells. Thus, inhibition of Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity using dominant-negative Tcf4 prevents EGF-mediated cell cycle progression. Since dominant-negative Tcf4 inhibits cyclin D1 promoter activity and BrdU uptake without affecting other EGF-mediated signals such as ERK that also regulate proliferation, we conclude that Tcf/Lef-mediated transcription is required for cell cycle progression. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-actin (Santa Cruz), anti-BrdU (Roche Applied Science), anti-ERK2 (Santa Cruz), anti-GSK3β (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-phospho-Ser9-GSK3β (BIOSOURCE), monoclonal and polyclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phosphotyrosine (Santa Cruz), and anti-Tcf4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Cell Culture—SW480 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). MCF-10A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing HEPES and l-glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% (v/v) horse serum (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech), 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 0.1 μg/ml cholera toxin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For serum starvation, the cells were washed twice in PBS and then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 24 h. Plasmid Constructs—pcDNA-myc-ΔN-Tcf4 was generously provided by K. W. Kinzler (Johns Hopkins University) (7Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Clevers H.

Fearon E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VSV-G and gag-pol vectors were gifts from D. Schaffer (University of California, Berkeley). Luciferase-based reporters pTOPFLASH and pFOPFLASH were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., whereas 1745CD1 was a gift from R. Pestell (Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.) (39Albanese C.

Retroviral Infection—Retrovirus was produced by either by single transfection of the packaging cell line 293GPG with 15 μg of retroviral plasmid (40Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) or by triple transfection of 293T cells with 5 μg each of VSV-G, gag-pol and a retroviral vector using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). For infection, MCF-10A cells were incubated with retrovirus containing medium and 8 μg/ml polybrene for 24 h. GSK3β Serine 9 Phosphorylation Assay—MCF-10A cells were plated at a subconfluent density (105 cells/35-mm dish) and allowed to adhere for 48 h, followed by serum starvation for 24 h. The cells were stimulated with either full growth medium or serum-free medium supplemented with either 10 μg/ml insulin or 20 ng/ml EGF and then lysed in modified RIPA buffer at desired times. ERK Signaling Assay—MCF-10A cells were plated at a subconfluent density (105 cells/35-mm dish), allowed to adhere for 24 h, and then infected with retrovirus encoding pPGS or pPGS-FLAG-ΔN-Tcf4 at multiplicity of infection equal to 1. Twenty-four hours after infection, the cells were starved in serum-free medium for 24 h, stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF in serum-free medium, and then lysed in modified RIPA buffer at desired times. Cell Lysis—The stimulated cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and scraped into cold lysis buffer. After incubating on ice for 15 min, the cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected as whole cell lysate. The protein concentrations were determined using BCA reagents (Sigma). The samples prepared to assay EGF-mediated activation of the ERK pathway were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3) 10 mm NaPP, 30 mm NaF, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Finally, cell lysis for all reporter measurements was performed in 1× passive lysis buffer provided by the manufacturer (Promega). Reporter Assays—SW480 or MCF-10A cells were plated at a subconfluent density (105 cells/35-mm dish) and co-transfected with 1 μg of the appropriate reporter and 0.1 μg of pRL-TK using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). SW480 cells were always maintained in growth medium and lysed 48 h after transfection. Meanwhile, MCF-10A cells were serum-starved for 24 h, stimulated with appropriate medium, and lysed at desired times. In both cases, reporter activity was measured using the dual luciferase assay according to the manufacturer instructions (Promega). To normalize for potential variations in transfection or lysis efficiency, luciferase signals were normalized to control Renilla luciferase signal. Integrated Reporter Response—The reporter signal response above its initial value was integrated numerically over time as follows,∫012R(t)−R(t0)dt=((12∑k=1nR(tk)+R(tk−1))−(n−1)R(t0))Δt(Eq. 1) where R(t) is the reporter signal, R(t0) is its basal, initial value, tk is the time ranging from 0 to 12 h in discrete intervals of Δt (3 h), n is the number of time points (n = 5), and k is the index of summation. Western Blotting—Whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 7.5-10% gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked overnight and then incubated sequentially with primary and corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were treated with SuperSignal West Femto Substrate (Pierce) and imaged on VersaDoc 3000 (Bio-Rad) using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). DNA Synthesis—DNA synthesis was assayed by either [3H]thymidine or BrdU incorporation. In both cases, MCF-10A cells were seeded at the indicated cell densities. After 24 h, the cells were either infected with retrovirus or left in growth medium. On the following day, the cells were serum-starved. Notably, the 48 h of duration between cell seeding and serum starvation was chosen to match the time required for plating and transfecting cells in reporter assays, allowing direct comparison between DNA synthesis and reporter experiments. Following 24 h of serum starvation, the cells were stimulated with appropriate medium. Sixteen hours after stimulation, the medium was replaced with identical medium supplemented with either 10 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (ICN Biomedicals) or 10 μmol/liter BrdU (Roche Applied Science) and further incubated for 6 h. In the case of [3H]thymidine incorporation, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, incubated in 5% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min at 4 °C, washed twice with cold 70% ethanol, and incubated with 0.1 m NaOH, 2% Na2CO3, and 1% SDS for 30 min at 37 °C. The solution was collected and mixed with CytoScint (ICN Biomedicals) for scintillation counting. For BrdU detection, the cells were fixed and co-stained with DAPI, anti-BrdU antibody, and polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody. The number of nuclei stained positive for BrdU and FLAG were quantified in 3-10 different fields on 2-5 independent trials using the Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope. Immunofluorescence—For Tcf/FLAG co-staining, the cells grown on glass coverslips were washed three times in ice-cold PBS, fixed in 4% formalin in PBS, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100. After blocking overnight in BB (10% goat serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS), the coverslips were sequentially incubated with primary and corresponding Alexa dye-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Following antibody incubations, the coverslips were stained with DAPI (Sigma) and mounted using Prolong Anti-Fade (Molecular Probes). For BrdU/FLAG co-staining, the cells were fixed and permeabilized in 4% formalin and 0.2% Triton X-100, respectively, and then incubated with polyclonal FLAG antibody and Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody. The antibodies were then fixed in 4% formalin, followed by a second fixation in 15 mm glycine in 70% ethanol (pH 2). The coverslips were incubated with monoclonal BrdU antibody and then Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody, stained with DAPI, and mounted as described above. Re-entry into the Cell Cycle Correlates with Tcf/Lef Reporter Activity—Target genes for Tcf/Lef include cyclin D1 and c-myc, suggesting a role for this family of transcription factors in cell cycle progression not only among cancer cells with stabilized nuclear β-catenin, but also among normal epithelial cells. Therefore, we determined whether a correlation exists between Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and cell cycle progression in nontransformed mammary epithelial (MCF-10A) cells. Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity was monitored with TOPFLASH reporter (7Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar), a plasmid containing consensus Tcf-binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene. In contrast, the negative control FOPFLASH reporter carries mutations at these Tcf/Lef-binding sites. Performance of TOPFLASH and FOPFLASH reporters was confirmed in SW480 colon carcinoma cells in which TOPFLASH, but not FOPFLASH, is constitutively active because of a truncation of the APC gene and consequent stabilization of β-catenin (7Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Subconfluent MCF-10A cells transfected with TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH reporters were growth-arrested by serum starvation and then stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by treatment with growth medium. As shown in Fig. 1B, growth medium stimulation activated TOPFLASH reporter, which gradually increased to a near-maximum level within the first 9 h. Meanwhile, FOPFLASH negative control reporter did not respond to growth medium stimulation. Taken together, this establishes a correlation between re-entry into the cell cycle and Tcf/Lef-mediated transcription. To confirm further that the observed TOPFLASH signal was specifically monitoring Tcf/Lef transcription factor activity, a dominant-negative Tcf4 construct (myc-ΔN-Tcf4) was employed. This construct possesses the DNA-binding domain of Tcf4 but lacks the N-terminal 31 amino acids that mediate its association with its transactivating catenin partner (7Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). As expected, dominant-negative Tcf4 inhibited TOPFLASH activity in SW480 cells (Fig. 2A). Co-transfection of ΔN-Tcf4 into MCF-10A cells decreased growth medium-induced TOPFLASH response in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2B), indicating that the TOPFLASH signal was mediated specifically by Tcf/Lef transcription factors. EGF Independently Induces Tcf/Lef Transcriptional Activity and DNA Synthesis—Because MCF-10A growth medium contains a complex mixture of stimuli, including serum factors, insulin, and EGF, it is unclear whether a single constituent is capable of inducing Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and, moreover, whether the same constituent also functions as a mitogen. To address this issue, the cells were stimulated with each constituent of growth medium separately, and Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and DNA synthesis were assessed by measuring TOPFLASH reporter signal and [3H]thymidine uptake, respectively. EGF independently induced TOPFLASH signal to a level distinctly above the corresponding FOPFLASH control (Fig. 3A). At early time, EGF-mediated TOPFLASH signal mirrors growth medium-induced TOPFLASH activity. However, whereas full growth medium sustains TOPFLASH signal to 24 h (Fig. 1A), EGF promotes a transient signal that reaches its peak intensity of nearly 3-fold above basal level at 3 h. Meanwhile, in contrast to EGF, insulin-mediated TOPFLASH activation more closely matches the FOPFLASH negative control, except at 3 h where a transient signal that is ∼50% of the EGF-mediated TOPFLASH signal is observed. Taken together, growth medium constituents quantitatively vary in their ability to promote Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity, with EGF, more so than insulin, resembling the response to full growth medium. The current paradigm for Wnt-mediated Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity involves inhibition of GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin, which in turn stabilizes β-catenin and ultimately enables its translocation into the nucleus (41Huelsken J. Behrens J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3977-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 42Hendriks B. Reichmann E. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 43Barker N.

This gene encodes a 126-amino acid protein that includes the characteristic Nudix motif conserved among Nudix proteins. Ndx1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Ndx1 was stable up to 95 °C and at extreme pH. Size exclusion chromatography indicated that Ndx1 was monomeric in solution. Ndx1 specifically hydrolyzed (di)adenosine polyphosphates but not ATP or diadenosine triphosphate, and it always generated ATP as the product. Diadenosine hexaphosphate (Ap6A), the most preferred substrate, was hydrolyzed to produce two ATP molecules, which is a novel hydrolysis mode for Ap6A, with a Km of 1.4 μm and a kcat of 4.1 s–1. These results indicate that Ndx1 is a (di)adenosine polyphosphate hydrolase. Ndx1 activity required the presence of the divalent cations Mn2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, and Co2+, whereas Ca2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ were not able to activate Ndx1. Fluoride ion inhibited Ndx1 activity via a non-competitive mechanism. Optimal activity for Ap6A was observed at around pH 8.0 and about 70 °C. We found two important residues with pKa values of 6.1 and 9.6 in the free enzyme and pKa values of 7.9 and 10.0 in the substrate-enzyme complex. Kinetic studies of proteins with amino acid substitutions suggested that Glu-46 and Glu-50 were conserved residues in the Nudix motif and were involved in catalysis.

It is the most thermophilic eubacterium for which a gene manipulation system has been established (18Yamagishi A. Tanimoto T. Suzuki T. Oshima T. Appl. Environ.

Interestingly, Deinococcus radiodurans, which is very closely related to T. thermophilus, possesses twenty-three Nudix genes (23White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D.

Science. 1999; 286: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). This bacterium is characterized by extraordinary resistance to ionizing radiation; it is thought that some of its Nudix proteins may be associated with novel DNA repair pathways (24Xu W. Shen J. Dunn C.A. Desai S. Bessman M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the diversity of substrates and functions of Nudix proteins in vivo remain unclear. Such unique features make proteins of this family good targets for structural and functional proteomics. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism and physiological functions of Nudix proteins from T. thermophilus HB8. In this work, we describe the overexpression and purification of T. thermophilus HB8 Ndx1 protein. The enzymatic activity and the biochemical properties of Ndx1 are also described. Materials—DNA-modifying enzymes, including restriction enzymes, were from Takara Shuzo and New England Biolabs. Yeast extract and polypeptone were from Difco. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was from Wako Pure Chemicals. Escherichia coli strains BL21(DE3) and DH5α and plasmids pET-11b and pT7Blue were from Novagen. Toyopearl-SuperQ and Toyopearl-Phenyl 650M were from Tosoh. Superdex 75 10/30 was from Amersham Bioscience. The CAPCELL PAK C18 column was from Shiseido. The molecular weight marker kit was from Sigma. Dinucleoside polyphosphates (diadenosine hexaphosphate (Ap6A), diadenosine pentaphosphate (Ap5A), diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), diadenosine triphosphate (Ap3A), diguanosine pentaphosphate (Gp5G), diguanosine tetraphosphate (Gp4G)) and other nucleotide derivatives (adenosine tetraphosphate (p4A), ATP, GTP, ADP-ribose, NADH, NAD+, CoA, and acetyl CoA) were from Sigma. TaKaRa LA Taq was from Takara Shuzo. The synthesized DNA oligomers were from BEX Co. All other reagents used were of the highest grade commercially available. Overexpression of the ndx1 Gene—Preliminary sequence data for the T. thermophilus HB8 ndx1 gene, which contains the Nudix motif, was provided by the T. thermophilus HB8 genome project (21Yokoyama S. Hirota H. Kigawa T. Yabuki T. Shirouzu M. Terada T. Ito Y. Matsuo Y. Kuroda Y. Nishimura Y. Kyogoku Y. Miki K. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Nat. Struct.

Nishimura Y. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 73: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using this information, two primers for amplification of the target gene were synthesized, and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was carried out using these primer and LA Taq polymerase. The primer sequences were 5′-ATATCATATGGAGCTAGGGGCCGGGGGCGTGGTCTT-3′ and 5′-ATATAGATCTTTATTAAAGCGGTAGACGCTCAAGGG-3′, and the underlining indicates NdeI and BglII sites. The amplified gene fragment was ligated into pET-11b (Novagen) using NdeI and BamHI sites following TA cloning and sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed by the resulting plasmid were grown at 37 °C to 5 × 108 cell/ml on 1.5 liters of LB medium containing ampicillin. The cells were then incubated for 4 h in the presence of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, harvested by centrifugation, and stored at –20 °C. Purification of Ndx1—All purification steps described below were carried out at room temperature. Frozen cells (3 g) were suspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 20% (w/v) saccharose (pH 8.5)) and disrupted by ultrasonication on ice. After Brij-58 was added to a final concentration of 0.2% (w/v), the cell lysate was stirred for 1 h at 4 °C. Next, the lysate was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and centrifuged (about 30,000 × g) for 60 min. Then the supernatant was dialyzed against buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% (w/v) glycerol (pH 8.5)) for 16 h. The dialysate was applied to a Toyopearl-SuperQ column (bed volume 12 ml) that had been equilibrated with buffer I. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1.0 m in a total volume of 60 ml of buffer I. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the fractions containing the Ndx1 protein to a final concentration of 15% saturation. The protein solution was then applied to a Toyopearl-Phenyl 650M column (bed volume 10 ml) previously equilibrated with buffer I containing 15% saturated ammonium sulfate. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate from 15 to 0% saturation in a total volume of 50 ml of buffer I. Fractions containing the Ndx1 protein were collected and concentrated using a Vivaspin (5000 cut off) concentrator. The concentrated solution was applied to a Superdex 75 10/30 column (bed volume 24 ml) previously equilibrated with buffer II (50 mm Tris-HCl and 100 mm KCl (pH 7.5)) and eluted with the same buffer using ΔKTA explorer (Amersham Biosciences). The fraction containing the Ndx1 protein was concentrated and stored at 4 °C. At each chromatography, the elution profile was assessed by SDS-PAGE containing 12% (w/v) acrylamide. The N-terminal sequence of the purified Ndx1 was analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer. CD Spectrometry—Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were carried out with a Jasco spectropolarimeter, model J-720W. CD spectra of 5 μm Ndx1 were measured in a 1-mm cell in the far-UV region between 200 and 250 nm. Measurements were performed after incubation at 25 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 100 mm KCl. Thermostability was assessed by measuring CD values at 222 nm at a 1 °C/min rate. CD data were converted to the mean residue ellipticity, [θ], in deg cm2 dmol–1. Size Exclusion Chromatography—The oligomeric state of Ndx1 in solution was assessed by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 75 HR 10/30. A sample contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, and 0.1 μm Ndx1, which were the same conditions used to assay Ndx1 activity. The protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl and 100 mm KCl (pH 7.5) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min by the ΔKTA system. The molecular weight of Ndx1 was estimated using molecular weight marker proteins (Sigma). Hydrolase Activity Assay—The activity of Ndx1 was measured by quantifying the amounts of substrates and products with an ion-pair reversed-phase high performance chromatography according to a slightly modified method of Samizo et al. (25Samizo K. Ishikawa R. Nakamura A. Kohama K. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, substrate, and Ndx1 were incubated at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 100 mm EDTA, and the protein was removed by ultrafiltration using a membrane filter. The 100-μl aliquot of the filtrate was applied to a reversed-phase column (CAPCELL PAK C18, 4.6 × 75 mm), which was equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 5 mm tetra-n-butyl ammonium phosphate, and 10% methanol. Elution was performed by a gradient of 10–50% methanol. Nucleotides were detected at 260 nm, and their identifications were based on their retention times. Their concentrations were calculated by the integration of their respective peak areas. Concentrations of substrates were varied between 0.2 and 16 μm. Initial velocity was calculated from product concentration and plotted against substrate concentration. These were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation and Hanes-Woolf plot, and the kinetic constant was calculated using the software Igor Pro 3.14 (Wave Metrics). Fitting Plot of pH-dependent Assay—Assuming Scheme 1 for the Ndx1 reaction, the following equations could be generated (26Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999: 169-190Google Scholar). In short, there are two residues that are related to catalysis by Ndx1. Km=Ks(1+[H+]/Kel+Ke2/[H+])/(1+[H+]/Kes1+Kes2/[H+])(Eq. 1) V=k2[E0]/(1+[H+]/Kes1+Kes2/[H+])(Eq. 2) kcat=k2/(1+[H+]/Kes1+Kes2/[H+])(Eq. 3) V/Km=k2[E0]/{Ks(1+[H+]/Ke1+Ke2/[H+])}(Eq. 4) kcat/Km=k2/{Ks(1+[H+]/Ke1+Ke2/[H+])}(Eq. 5) The pKa values of one residue are pKe1 and pKes1 at free enzyme and complex, respectively. Similarly, those of the other residue are pKe2 and pKes2. These pKa values were calculated by fitting the data to Equations 1, 2, 3 using the software Igor Pro 3.14 (Wave Metrics) Fluorescence Measurements—The fluorescence emission of Ndx1 was measured with a Hitachi spectrofluorometer, model F-4500. All measurements were taken with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm in a 5 × 5-mm quartz cuvette at 25 °C. The fluorescence titration was carried out by measuring the emission intensity at 328 nm. The reaction mixture (200 μm) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm Ndx1, and various concentrations of ATP (pH 7.5). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Pairs of oligonucleotides about 30 bases in length with melting temperatures of about 67 °C and containing the desired substitutions were designed. The ndx1 gene includes NruI and PshAI sites at the 60th and 155th positions, respectively. For W26A substitution, the region between the NruI site and BglII site at the 3′ terminus of the gene was amplified by PCR. For R45K, E46Q, E49Q, and E50Q substitution, the regions between the 5′ terminal NdeI site and PshAI site were amplified. The amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the pT7Blue vector by TA cloning. E. coli DH5α were transformed with the constructed plasmid DNA and cultured. Substitution at the desired positions was confirmed by sequencing. Then the wild-type fragments in the expression vector were replaced by the confirmed fragments containing the mutations. Preparation of Ndx1—Using information from the T. thermophilus HB8 genome project, we identified eight open reading frames containing Nudix motifs and named them ndx1 to ndx8. The ndx1 gene product (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ accession number AB125632; project code 1331) comprises 126 amino acids, has a molecular mass of 14.2 kDa, and has a theoretical pI of 4.8. When a BLAST search was carried out using the Ndx1 sequence as a query, Ndx1 was the most similar (about 25% identity) to Ap4A hydrolases from Caenorhabditis elegans, human, and pig (Fig. 1A). However, the sequence similarity was restricted to the surroundings of the Nudix motif and was not enough to determine whether Ndx1 is an Ap4A hydrolase or not. Thus, Ndx1 was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) under the control of an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside -inducible T7 promoter. The induced band at ∼15 kDa (corresponding to the size of Ndx1) was observed in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2), and we purified the protein to homogeneity utilizing three column chromatography steps (see details under “Experimental Procedures”). The sequence of the N-terminal nine residues of the overexpressed protein agreed with the residues predicted from the ndx1 sequence, confirming that the purified protein was Ndx1. Approximately 25 mg of Ndx1 was obtained from 3 g of cells. Physicochemical Properties—Size exclusion chromatography was performed to investigate the oligomeric state of Ndx1. The elution profile of Ndx1 showed a single peak (Fig. 2B). The apparent molecular mass corresponding to the peak was estimated to be 17 kDa, which was similar to the 14.2-kDa mass calculated from the sequence. This indicates that Ndx1 exists in a monomeric state in solution. The far-UV CD spectrum of the purified Ndx1 showed negative double maxima at 209 and 220 nm (Fig. 3A), characteristic of an α-helical structure. The stability of Ndx1 to temperature and pH was examined based on the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm ([θ]222). Ndx1 was stable up to 95 °C at pH 7.5 (Fig. 3B) and stable in a wide range of pH at 25 °C (Fig. 3C). Enzymatic Activity—Most Nudix proteins examined to date are nucleotide pyrophosphatases that hydrolyze a nucleoside diphosphate linked to another moiety (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Therefore, enzymatic activity of Ndx1 was examined for a wide range of nucleotides known to be substrates of other Nudix proteins. Ndx1 was inactive toward the following nucleotides when assayed at 50 μm: 5′-(deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates, 5′-nucleoside diphosphates, nucleoside diphosphate sugars, NADH, NAD+, CoA, and acetyl CoA. Significant activity was found toward dinucleotide polyphosphates and nucleotide polyphosphates. The respective substrates yielded products as follows: Ap6A, 2ATP; Ap5A, ATP and ADP; Ap4A, ATP and AMP; p4A, ATP and inorganic orthophosphate (Table I). In all cases ATP was generated as a product. ATP and Ap3A were not hydrolyzed by Ndx1. These data indicate that Ndx1 protein has ATP-generating (di)nucleotide polyphosphate hydrolase activity.Table IKinetic constants for Ndx1SubstrateProductkcatKmkcat/ Kms-1μmm-1 s-1Ap6AATP4.11.42.9 × 106p4AATP, Pi1.41.01.4 × 106Ap5AATP, ADP0.521.14.7 × 105Ap4AATP, AMP0.271.12.5 × 105Gp5GGTP, GDP0.271.42.0 × 105Gp4GGTP, GMP0.099.39.7 × 103 Open table in a new tab Table I shows the steady-state kinetic constants for each active substrate assuming Michaelis-Menten type reactions. Whereas the Km values for these substrates were all about 1 μm, the catalytic constants (kcat) varied among the tested substrates (Table I). Based on the catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km), the highest activity was observed for Ap6A followed by p4A, Ap5A, and Ap4A (Table I). The substrate preference was Ap6A > p4A ≫ Ap5A > Ap4A for polyphosphates and adenosine > guanosine for the base. Therefore, we conclude that Ndx1 is an ATP-generating Ap6A hydrolase. Among the known enzymes that specifically hydrolyze Ap6A, Ndx1 is the only enzyme that symmetrically hydrolyzes Ap6A. Divalent metal ions were essential for Ndx1 activity, which is a common property of Nudix proteins (27Frick D.N. Weber D.J. Gillespie J.R. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1794-1803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of several divalent metal ions (each 5 mm) on Ndx1 activity for Ap6A was investigated. Significant activity was observed in the presence of Mn2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ with the apparent rate constant of kapp values of 8.6, 4.2, and 4.1 s–1, respectively. In contrast, there was low activity in the presence of Co2+ (kapp, 0.51 s–1), and there was no activity in the presence of Ca2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+. Among monovalent ions, fluoride ion showed strong inhibition of the Ndx1 activity. Dependence of the inhibitory effect on fluoride ion concentration revealed that the inhibition was in a non-competitive manner with a Ki of 424 μm toward free enzyme and a Ki of 80 μm toward complex. Ndx1 exhibited higher activity at higher pH and little activity at lower pH. This observation is typical for the Nudix class of enzymes, which usually have optimal pH values in the alkaline range. The presence of two pKa values (7.9 and 10.0) was found in the plot of kcat against pH (Fig. 4A). The optimal pH for Ndx1 activity was about 8, judged by the catalytic efficiency kcat/Km (Fig. 4B). The plot of the kapp against temperature was bell-shaped; the optimal temperature for Ndx1 activity was 70 °C. This higher activity at higher temperature reflects a common property of enzymes from T. thermophilus. Protein-Substrate Interaction—The Km values of Ndx1 for several (di)adenosine polyphosphates were about 1 μm. Because these results suggest that the affinity for these substrates is almost the same, we hypothesized that Ndx1 recognized a common moiety of the substrates at the initial binding phase. Although several tertiary structures of Nudix proteins have been reported (2Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Gabelli S.B. Bianchet M.A. Bessman M.J. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8 (L.

Biol. 2000; 302: 1165-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), detailed investigations of substrate binding mechanisms have not often been performed by biochemical methods. The adenosine phosphate moiety is commonly contained in Ndx1 substrates, and Ndx1 has no activity toward ATP. Therefore, we measured the intrinsic fluorescence spectrum of Ndx1 upon binding to ATP to investigate the interaction between the protein and the adenosine phosphate moiety. The emission spectra were measured using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, which excited only tryptophan residues. When ATP was added to Ndx1, the fluorescence intensity at around 328 nm decreased (Fig. 5A, bold solid line). As the ATP concentration increased, the fluorescence intensity gradually decreased. These results suggest that the decrease in fluorescence intensity reflects the protein-substrate interaction. When dATP was used as a ligand, the fluorescence intensity also decreased but not equivalently to ATP. When the change in fluorescence intensity was plotted against ligand concentration, Kd was determined to be 13 μm for ATP and 36 μm for dATP based on bimolecular binding reaction (Fig. 5B). The affinity of Ndx1 for these nucleotides was also investigated by examining the inhibition of ATP and dATP on Ap6A hydrolysis by Ndx1 (not data shown). These results showed that Ki was 13 μm for ATP and 41 μm for dATP. When Mg2+ was omitted from the reaction mixture, no fluorescence change was observed (Fig. 5A, dotted line). Also, when GTP was used, the fluorescence intensity did not decrease, as is predicted by the low affinity of Ndx1 toward diguanosine polyphosphates. Among the four Trp residues of Ndx1, Trp-26 was conserved in the N-terminal half of the Nudix motif in the sequence of dinucleotide polyphosphate hydrolases (Fig. 1B). This raised the possibility that the observed fluorescence changes could be ascribed to Trp-26. This hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that the mutant W26A Ndx1, in which Trp-26 was replaced by alanine, showed no decrease in fluorescence intensity upon the addition of ATP (Fig. 5C). Catalytic Residues—From the dependence of Ndx1 hydrolysis activity on pH, pKa values of 7.9 and 10.0 were obtained from the kcat plot (Fig. 4A), and pKa values of 6.1 and 9.6 were obtained from the plot of kcat/Km (Fig. 4B). These pKa changes demonstrated that when free Ndx1 bound to the substrate, the pKa of one residue changed from 6.1 to 7.9, and the pKa of a second residue changed from 9.6 to 10.0. It is thought that two residues whose pKa values change play an important role in Ndx1 hydrolysis. In Ndx1, the conserved Nudix motif is located between Gly-31 and Val-53. In this motif, Glu-37, Arg-45, Glu-46, Glu-49, and Glu-50 are highly conserved across the sequences of Nudix proteins from plants, animals, and bacteria (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). When the glutamic acid residues (Glu-46, Glu-49, and Glu-50) in the Nudix motif were replaced by glutamine, the E46Q and E50Q mutants showed a 2.2 × 104-fold reduction and a 1.3 × 105-fold reduction in kcat, respectively (Table II). In contrast, the E49Q mutation had very little effect on activity (Table II). Moreover, mutation of the conserved Arg-45 residue to lysine only slightly reduced the activity (Table II).Table IIKinetic constants for Ap6A hydrolysis by mutant Ndx1MutantkcatKmkcat/ Kms-1μmm-1 s-1Wild type4.11.42.9 × 106W26A1.5197.8 × 104R45K5.5 × 10-1115.0 × 104E46Q8.9 × 10-41.65.6 × 102E49Q1.11.66.8 × 105E50Q5.2 × 10-52"
https://openalex.org/W2132269108,"CooA is a CO-dependent transcription factor of the bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum that contains a six-coordinate heme. It has as its heme axial ligands Pro2 and Cys75 in the ferric state and Pro2 and His77 in the ferrous state. To probe the regulation of CO binding and the ligand switching mechanism in CooA, we have prepared site-directed mutants in which the residues contributing the axial ligands are substituted. The properties of these mutants were investigated by resonance Raman and CO titration methods. Wild-type CooA binds CO with a modest dissociation constant (Kd) of 11 μm, this value being typical for gas-sensing heme proteins. The Kd value was greatly decreased in the P2H mutant, indicating that Pro2 coordination fine tunes CO sensing in CooA. The bound CO in P2H gives rise to a ν(Fe-CO) stretching Raman line at 490 cm-1, which is similar to that in wild-type CooA. Thus, Pro2 is the ligand that is replaced by exogenous CO. In the H77A mutant, equilibrium CO binding is biphasic, and at high CO pressures two CO molecules occupy both axial sites. The ν(Fe-CO) stretching Raman line for the first CO molecule was observed at 497 cm-1. Some of the His77 mutants showed an additional ν(Fe-CO) line at 525 cm-1. The binding affinity of the second CO molecule correlates with the five-coordinate component in the ferrous His77 mutants and also with the acidity of the side chain at position 77. Thus, we propose the Cys75-His77 ligand switch is controlled by His77 acting as a proton reservoir.

CooA is a homodimer (221 amino acids/monomer) containing two b-type hemes that reversibly bind CO. The signal of CO binding to the heme is transmitted to the DNA binding domain, enabling the protein to bind its target DNA sequence and induce transcription of the coo genes. The DNA binding and signaling domains are analogous to those found in the catabolite gene activator protein CAP (or CRP) (14Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P.

The heme in CooA is bound within the signaling domain where it is ligated by a histidine (His77) side chain in the ferrous state (14Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This ligand is replaced by the Cys75 side chain in the ferric state (16Shelver D.

Although ligand switching indicates that the position of the heme cofactor is flexible relative to the surrounding protein matrix of CooA, the physiological role and exact mechanism of the ligand switch remains elusive. The crystal structure of ferrous CooA revealed unexpectedly that the heme ligand trans to His77 is the amino-terminal proline residue (Pro2) from the opposite chain in the homodimer (see Fig. 1) (14Lanzilotta W.N.

Because the ferrous heme in CooA is six-coordinate and low spin with Pro2/His77 ligands, the CO-sensing mechanism of CooA necessarily involves the displacement of one of these two ligands. The displaced ligand in the CO-bound ferrous CooA is suggested to be Pro2 by nuclear magnetic resonance and time-resolved resonance Raman studies (21Yamamoto K. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K.

Although the release of Pro2 from the heme iron by incoming CO triggers the sequential events that result in the activation of CooA, a variety of Pro2 variants was found to be CO-responsive, indicating that Pro2 is not critical for activation of CooA in response to CO (19Thorsteinsson M.V.

In this paper, we present resonance Raman and CO titration analysis of wild-type (WT 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; mW, milliwatt. ) and a series of mutants of CooA in their ferric, ferrous, and ferrous-CO bound forms. Through the analysis of various mutants, it is established that the Pro2 and His77 residues regulate CO binding to CooA. Pro2 is revealed to be the ligand that is indeed replaced by exogenous CO, and the His77 ligand is required to direct the CO to the Pro2 side of the heme. The roles of these ligands are discussed in the light of CO recognition and redox-linked ligand-switching mechanisms in CooA. Cloning and Purification of CooA—To achieve high expression, a gene encoding WT CooA was synthesized using a modification of the recursive PCR strategy (25Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 827-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 26Casimiro D.R. Toy-Palmer A. Blake II, R.C. Dyson H.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 5886-5893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Based on the known amino acid sequence of R. rubrum CooA, six forward (Af1-3, Bf1-3) and six reverse (Ar1-3, Br1-3) primers with lengths ranging from 69 to 117 bases were designed (see Fig. 2) and custom-synthesized. Because the designed sequence is long, subsequent chain extension by KOD Plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo) was performed for two sets of primers, A and B, in which each pair of forward and reverse primers overlaps by about 20 bases. The full-length PCR product of set A was selectively amplified in a second PCR with a forward primer AF, which creates tandem XhoI and NdeI sites and a reverse primer AR, which generates a HindIII site (Fig. 2). The full-length PCR product of set B was also amplified with a forward primer BF, which creates a HindIII site and a reverse primer BR, which generates a termination codon (TAA) and a BamHI site. The resultant products were inserted at the XhoI/HindIII and HindIII/BamHI sites, respectively, of the plasmid pBluescriptII KS(+) (Stratagene) and joined at the common HindIII site, and the ligation products were used to transform E. coli XL-1 Blue MRF′ (Stratagene). The DNA sequence of the recombinant plasmid product was confirmed with a Li-Cor Model 4200S2 DNA sequencer. The QuikChange system (Stratagene) was used to introduce mutations into the CooA coding sequence. The NdeI/BamHI insert containing the full-length CooA coding sequence was excised from the pBluescript derivatives and ligated into a pET3a-based expression vector (pBEX) (27Uno T. Ryu D. Tsutsumi H. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Wilkinson A.J. Sato H. Hayashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5886-5893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ligation products were introduced into E. coli strain BL21Gold(DE3) (Stratagene). Cell growth and protein purification were performed as described previously (16Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified to homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE criteria. CooA concentrations were evaluated from the heme content, which was measured by a pyridine hemochrome assay and hence were based on a monomer unit. Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Spectra were recorded using a double monochromator (Jasco R-800) with a slit width of 6 cm-1, following excitation by a krypton ion laser (406.7 nm line, Coherent I-302). A photomultiplier detector was used (Hamamatsu Photonics, R595), and the frequencies were calibrated with indene. A spinning Raman cell was used throughout the measurements. The samples contained 100 μm protein in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Ferrous proteins were prepared by the addition of sodium dithionite, after purging extensively with nitrogen gas. The carbonmonoxy forms were prepared by the addition of sodium dithionite under 1 atm of CO. The spectra of the CO forms were obtained with a defocused laser beam. CO Titration—CO titration of ferrous CooA was performed in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 25 °C. A cuvette was filled with a CooA solution, which was purged extensively with nitrogen gas and stopped with a rubber septum, and the protein was reduced by an excess of sodium dithionite solution, which was injected by a syringe. Full reduction was confirmed by absorption spectroscopy (Beckman DU640). Aliquots of CO saturated in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and dithionite were added to the solution containing ∼2 μm protein, and the absorption spectra were recorded. The CO concentrations were calibrated using pig myoglobin. P2H and H77A—In Fig. 3, resonance Raman spectra of ferric WT, H77A, and P2H CooAs are shown. Resonance Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for revealing the oxidation states, spin states, and coordination numbers of heme iron (28Spiro T.G. Li X.-Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 3. Wiley-Interscience, New York1988: 1-38Google Scholar, 29Kincaid J.R. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook. 7. Academic Press, San Diego2000: 227-291Google Scholar). In the higher frequency region for WT and H77A CooA, the ν2, ν38, ν3, and ν4 lines are observed at 1583, 1549, 1501, and 1372 cm-1, respectively. These frequencies are typical of six-coordinate ferric low spin hemes and similar to those reported previously for the WT CooA (23Vogel K.M. Spiro T.G. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The profiles of WT and H77A are essentially the same, supporting the notion that His77 is not coordinating the iron in ferric CooA. In contrast, the spectra of P2H is altered with the ν3 line shifted to 1490 cm-1 with a broad line around 1580 cm-1. The ν3 frequency indicates the presence of a ferric five-coordinate heme, indicating that Pro2 is an axial ligand in the WT protein. A shoulder on the higher frequency side of the ν3 line indicates that there is a minor six-coordinate low spin component present. The broad profile around 1580 cm-1 also supports the presence of multiple components. In Fig. 4, resonance Raman spectra of ferrous WT, H77A, and P2H CooAs are shown. In the higher frequency region for WT CooA, the ν2, ν38, ν3, and ν4 lines are observed at 1581, 1555, 1493, and 1362 cm-1, respectively. These frequencies are typical of six-coordinate ferrous low spin hemes and similar to those reported previously for the WT CooA (23Vogel K.M. Spiro T.G. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). His77 and Pro2 are revealed to be the axial ligands of the ferrous CooA (Fig. 1) (14Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As expected, a resonance Raman line for a ferrous five-coordinate high spin component is apparent at 1470 cm-1 in the spectra for both H77A and P2H. However, other features are quite similar to those of WT CooA indicating that six-coordinate low spin species still dominate in these ligand mutants. In P2H, His2 may coordinate the ferrous heme, originating the low spin component. Such an explanation is not possible for H77A where His77 is replaced by non-coordinating alanine. This suggests strongly that an alternative ligand coordinates the ferrous heme in this mutant. This ligand could be the thiol moiety of Cys75 as will be discussed later. CO Titration—There is disagreement concerning the identity of the residue that is displaced by exogenous CO. Early studies suggested that CO displaces the His77 ligand (23Vogel K.M. Spiro T.G. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Dhawan I.K. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12805-12813Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas more recent studies indicate that the Pro2 is the ligand that is replaced (21Yamamoto K. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11473-11476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To resolve this controversy, we measured the CO binding properties of the axial ligand mutants of CooA (Fig. 5). The Q-band region of the absorption spectra of heme proteins is sensitive to the nature of the ligand. The spectrum of ferrous WT CooA shows sharp absorption bands around 560 and 530 nm, which are replaced by broad bands around 570 and 540 nm upon CO binding. These spectral changes are clearly associated with one set of isosbestic points, indicating that CO binding is a one-step equilibrium process (Fig. 5, top panel). Thus, the titration curve was analyzed in terms of a simple equilibrium between the ferrous and CO-bound forms of the protein. The absorbance changes at the Q-band maximum of the ferrous protein were normalized and plotted against the CO/CooA ratio (Fig. 5, bottom panel). A theoretical curve drawn, assuming that binding involves 1 equivalent of CO, provides a satisfactory fit to the titration data, and an apparent Kd value of 11 μm was calculated for CO binding to WT CooA (Table I). The P2H mutant has higher affinity for CO, its Kd value was estimated to be 53 nm. The titration curve saturates at a CO/CooA ratio of unity, indicating unequivocally that 1 mol of CO binds to each heme in the P2H mutant. Thus, the Pro2 residue regulates the CO binding affinity of CooA lowering the affinity by more than 2 orders of magnitude.Table IDissociation constants of CO in ferrous CooA mutants with selected heme proteinsProteinKd valuesKd1/μmKd2/μmWT11P2H0.053H77A0.08585H77Q0.2938H77S0.1137H77T0.006810H77E0.0369.7H77D0.424.2FixLaFrom Ref. 38.9.0DosbFrom Ref. 8.10NgbcNeuroglobin, from Ref. 27.0.174MbdMyoglobin, from Ref. 39.0.037a From Ref. 38Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G.

The first CO molecule clearly binds with a 1:1 stoichiometry to the H77A mutant with a Kd1 value of 85 nm (Fig. 5, bottom panel), which is similar to that for P2H. This is reasonable, because the His77 ligand is replaced by a non-coordinating alanine in this mutant, and a vacant site is expected to be created at the fifth coordination site of iron. The second CO molecule binds with much lower affinity, the Kd2 value being estimated to be 85 μm. The presence of two binding steps indicates that His77 is essential for directing exogenous CO to the appropriate side of the heme. This is likely to be important for inducing conformational changes in CooA that lead to binding to the target DNA. The Kd values for the axial ligand mutants of CooA are summarized in Table I. Two-step binding is prevalent among the His77 mutants, and the Kd values are affected by the nature of the replacement at position 77. Biphasic CO binding in the His77 mutants indicates that Pro2 must be being replaced by CO in the second binding step. The second CO binding event was not observed in the P2H mutant even at saturating concentrations of CO. This indicates unequivocally that Pro2 is more easily displaced by exogenous CO than His77. Fe-CO Stretch—To evaluate the properties of bound CO, the ν(Fe-CO) stretching Raman line was measured. The ν(Fe-CO) stretching frequency is sensitive to the polarity of the residues around the bound CO and is therefore an excellent probe of the distal environment (30Uno T. Nishimura Y. Tsuboi M. Makino R. Iizuka T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4549-4556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Li T. Quillin M.L. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S.

This line has been assigned to the ν(Fe-CO) stretching mode in experiments using isotopically labeled CO (35Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Ohkubo K. Nakajima H. Aono S.

In the Pro2 mutant, a similar line is observed at 491 cm-1, indicating that the environment of the bound CO is nearly the same as that in WT CooA. On the other hand, in the H77A mutant the corresponding ν(Fe-CO) stretch is observed at 497 cm-1, which is 7 cm-1 higher than that in WT CooA and should be assigned to the vibration from the Pro2-Fe-CO moiety. Many heme proteins have a histidine ligand trans to CO in the ferrous CO-bound state, and the higher ν(Fe-CO) stretch is a signature of a positively charged CO environment (31Li T. Quillin M.L. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 32Ray G.B. Li X.-Y. Ibers J.A. Sessler J.L. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem.

The higher frequency in H77A suggests that the bound CO is in a more positively polar environment than that in WT and P2H proteins, although the ν(Fe-CO) frequency in the proline-coordinated heme-CO complex has not been determined to date. In some of the His77 mutants, an additional Raman line is observed at about 525 cm-1 in the frequency region of the ν(Fe-CO) stretch (Fig. 6). The relative intensity of this extra line depends on the residue at position 77. Position 77 side chains having a labile proton (H77D and H77E) exhibit a stronger line. This is especially noticeable in the H77D mutant. The appearance of two lines indicates two distinct structures for the Fe-CO bond, and this in turn may be related to the two binding steps observed in the CO titration experiments. It should be noted that the Kd2 value for H77D is the smallest among the H77 mutants (Table I), and this implies that the second CO binds easily to the ferrous heme in this mutant. H77T, which exhibits a minor ν(Fe-CO) stretching band around 525 cm-1, has a relatively small Kd2 value (Fig. 6). Thus, the labile proton is not a prerequisite for the appearance of the second ν(Fe-CO) component. Ferrous and Ferric Heme in His77 Mutants—Because some of the His77 mutants showed two ν(Fe-CO) components, the incoming CO molecule must recognize structural differences in the mutants in the ferrous state. As seen in Fig. 7, the ferrous high spin component of ν3 is observed at 1471 cm-1 in every His77 mutant. In addition, a line seems to be buried around 1600 cm-1 in the His77 mutants, and this line can be assigned to the ν37 mode of the ferrous high spin component. The relative intensity of the ν3 line, however, varies among the mutants, and those having labile protons (H77E and H77D) give rise to a stronger line at 1471 cm-1. Again, this proton is not a prerequisite for the strong 1471 cm-1 line, because H77T shows a similar profile to those of H77E and H77D. To clarify whether the replacements may affect the Cys coordination in the ferric CooA, we studied the coordination structure by resonance Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 8). In the ferric state, spectral differences among the His77 mutants are not observed. Thus, it is clear that coordination of the ferric heme by the Cys ligand, is unaffected by the nearby His77 replacements.Fig. 8High-frequency resonance Raman spectra of the ferric CooA. From top: WT, H77A, H77Q, H77S, H77T, H77E, and H77D. The samples contained 100 μm proteins in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0).

Because the ν(Fe-CO) stretching frequency in the WT and P2H proteins is quite similar (Fig. 6), the dissociated Pro2 ligand may be remote from the ferrous heme. Indeed, truncation of the amino-terminal residues has little effect on the activation of CooA, and the amino-terminal residues are known to be highly flexible (19Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. Serate J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol.

As seen in the resonance Raman spectra of ferric (Fig. 3) and ferrous (Fig. 4) P2H, a six-coordinate component dominates in this mutant even though one of the axial ligands has been replaced. Although the identity of the ligand trans to His77 is unclear at present, the imidazole nitrogen or the terminal amino group of His2 in P2H could possibly be the sixth ligand. In this case, however, the coordination would be weak enough to lead the appearance of a five-coordinate component. The CO binding affinity of heme proteins is usually determined from kinetic studies. When the kinetics are monophasic the ratio of kon and koff is equal to the dissociation constant Kd. In the case of CooA, however, the CO binding kinetics is multiphasic (35Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Ohkubo K. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol.

In this study, we could estimate the CO affinity of WT CooA for the first time using an equilibrium titration method (Table I), and the Kd value is similar to those for other proteins that sense gaseous ligands (8Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 38Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8067-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Most of the gas sensors contain a six-coordinate heme, and this character seems to be unique in this class of proteins. Six coordination is inherently unsuitable for the binding of exogenous gaseous ligand, because the sixth ligand would be expected to present a barrier to binding. As seen in P2H, the substitution of the sixth Pro2 ligand greatly enhances the CO affinity, and the Kd value approaches that of myoglobin (39Egeberg K.D. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Carver T.E.

The presence of a five-coordinate component in the P2H mutant is apparent from the resonance Raman spectra (Fig. 4). Thus, the presence of Pro2 as a sixth coordinating ligand is a way to fine tune the sensing of CO in the media. It should be noted that neuroglobin shows a relatively small Kd value, although this globin protein contains a six-coordinate heme with His/His axial ligands (27Uno T. Ryu D. Tsutsumi H. Tomisugi Y.

This may imply that neuroglobin is equipped with a special device that facilitates the binding of gaseous molecules. Two Fe-CO Lines—In the His77 mutants, the CO binds in a two-step manner, and the Kd1 value is similar to that observed for P2H (Table I). The estimated Kd1 values are reasonable, because one of the axial ligands is replaced in these mutants, and the first CO molecule “sees” the vacant coordination site (Fig. 9). However, the second CO molecule attacks the trans sixth site after the binding of the first CO has taken place with 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 5). Thus, the coordination of His77 is essential both to direct the CO molecules to the correct sixth coordination site (otherwise occupied by Pro2) and to block the binding of a second CO species. This observation is in accord with the previous report (21Yamamoto K. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11473-11476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that CO binds to the “wrong” side of the heme in the H77Y mutant. Ferrous His77 mutants contain both six- and five-coordinate ferrous hemes (Fig. 7), and the ligand trans to Pro2 in the six-coordinate species is suggested to be the thiol moiety of Cys75 as will be discussed later. It may be argued that the first CO replaces the Pro2 even in the six-coordinate His77 mutants. If Pro2 is replaced by the first CO, we should expect the appearance of a ν(Fe-CO) stretching line around 520 cm-1 from the Cys75-Fe-CO moiety in the His77 mutants, because weak ligands such as thiol should give rise to a trans ν(Fe-CO) stretch around this frequency. Although such a line is observed at 525 cm-1 in these mutants (Fig. 6), this line is related more to the five-coordinate component in the ferrous protein (Fig. 7). Thus, H77D, H77E, and H77T show a relatively strong five-coordinate component at 1471 cm-1, and these mutants also show relatively strong 525 cm-1 lines. Thus, the 525 cm-1 line should not be attributed to the vibration from the Cys75-Fe-CO moiety. The CO-bound WT CooA was very photolabile, and the laser power had to be reduced to 1 mW to measure the ν(Fe-CO) stretching Raman line (Fig. 6). However, the CO adducts of the His77 mutants were relatively stable and could be probed with a higher laser power (3 mW). This greater stability may be related to the higher affinity of these mutants for CO as reflected in the lower Kd1 values (Table I). The second CO molecule, however, binds with much lower affinity as revealed by the larger Kd2 values relative to WT CooA. Thus, the ν(Fe-CO) stretch at 497 cm-1, which is commonly observed in the His77 mutants, should be assigned to the first CO molecule bound to the ferrous heme. Among the His77 mutants, H77D showed the lowest Kd2 value, and this value is lower than the Kd for WT CooA (Table I). This suggests that the second CO molecule ought to be observed in the H77D mutant. H77E and H77T showed Kd2 values comparable with the Kd for WT CooA, and a weak but definite Raman line is observed around 525 cm-1 in these mutants. Thus, the 525 cm-1 component should be assigned to the second CO molecule that is bound to the ferrous heme trans to the first CO molecule. The CO binding scheme for the His77 mutants is illustrated in Fig. 9. The first CO molecule coordinates the ferrous heme with high affinity and 1:1 stoichiometry as revealed by the CO titration experiments (Fig. 5). The vacant fifth site in these mutants favors CO binding, giving rise to the 497 cm-1 ν(Fe-CO) stretch. The second CO molecule replaces the Pro2 ligand trans to the first CO, and the resultant CO-Fe-CO moiety gives rise to the 525 cm-1 line. Ligand Switch—As seen in Fig. 7, the ferrous His77 mutants contain six- and five-coordinate hemes, and the amount of the latter component seems to be related to the availability of a proton that is capable of hydrogen bonding in the presence of a hydrogen bond donor group. In the ferric state, Cys75 coordination is unaffected by the residue at position 77 (Fig. 8). The ferric heme favors anionic thiolate coordination, which neutralizes the positive charge of the iron. In the ferrous state, the iron is already neutralized by the pyrrole nitrogens of the porphyrin ring, and no balancing charge is required. Hence the neutral thiol form is the favored ligand (Fig. 9). In the crystal structure of ferrous CooA, the only residue capable of coordination in the vicinity of the ferrous heme is Cys75 (14Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). When a proton is available, the neutral thiol group of Cys75 may make a hydrogen bond with the side chain of residue 77, directing the thiol group off the ferrous heme (Fig. 9). In this context, His77 is a proton reservoir controlling the protonation state of the Cys75 side chain. In the ferric state, the imidazole moiety of His77 takes up a proton and facilitates the formation of thiolate, whereas in the ferrous state, the proton is passed to the thiolate, and the resultant neutral imidazole favors binding to the ferrous heme. In summary, we have been able to determine the CO binding affinity of CooA, and the affinity was found to be similar to other heme-based gas sensors. Pro2 is assigned unequivocally to the ligand that is replaced by exogenous CO. Pro2 and His77 ligands are essential for regulating CO binding to CooA and hence for sensing the levels of CO in the medium. His77 plays a key role in the ligand switch in CooA depending on the iron-redox state in that the imidazole group is a proton reservoir affecting the protonation state of the Cys75 side chain.

The large majority of current research into the insulin-stimulated PI3K signaling pathway focuses almost exclusively on molecules activated as a result of PI3K mediated PIP3 production (13Cohen P.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In contrast to the intense interest in the role of PIP3 in insulin action, there has been much less characterization of PIP2 function in insulin-stimulated glucose transport. The integral involvement of PIP2 in vesicle trafficking and actin remodelling events are well documented (reviewed in Ref. 21Martin T.F.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and these two events are essential if Glut4 vesicles are to move from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. Insulin stimulation of PI3K activity will lead to a loss of PIP2, as a result of its conversion to PIP3 (22Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). In addition, insulin has been shown to stimulate phospholipase C (PLC) activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes; PLC catalyzes the breakdown of PIP2 generating diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (23Eichhorn J. Kayali A.G. Austin D.A. Webster N.J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, insulin stimulation of adipocytes will promote a loss of PIP2 as a result of conversion to PIP3 and breakdown to DAG and IP3. Here, we have analyzed the function of the substrate of PI3K activity, PIP2, in insulin-stimulated glucose transport. To assess the role of PIP2 in insulin action, we have examined the effects of neomycin, an aminoglycoside that binds and masks PIP2 (24Gabev E. Kasianowicz J. Abbott T. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 25Arbuzova A. Martushova K. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Morris A.J. Ozaki S. Prestwich G.D. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), on insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation and glucose transport. Remarkably, neomycin was found to prevent wortmannin inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport and Glut4 translocation without effect on PKB phosphorylation or activity. These results suggest that an important requirement for efficient insulin-stimulated glucose transport is the loss or “masking” of PIP2.

For neomycin-treated cells, neomycin was maintained at a concentration of 10 mm throughout the experiment. The serum-starved cells were washed twice in 2 ml/well of Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 118 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 2.5 mm CaCl2).

Neomycin Restores the Insulin-stimulated Glucose Transport Inhibited by the PI3K Inhibitor Wortmannin—To analyze the possible role of PIP2 in insulin-stimulated glucose transport, we examined the effect of the aminoglycoside, neomycin, on glucose transport into 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This agent was chosen as it binds with high specificity to PIP2 (24Gabev E. Kasianowicz J. Abbott T. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 25Arbuzova A. Martushova K. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Morris A.J. Ozaki S. Prestwich G.D. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and has been used previously in several studies examining PIP2 function (28Laux T. Fukami K. Thelen M. Golub T. Frey D. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1455-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 29Kwik J. Boyle S. Fooksman D. Margolis L. Sheetz M.P. Edidin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The results in Fig. 1A show that 10 mm neomycin had no significant effect on the basal level of glucose transport compared with vehicle. Incubation of adipocytes in 100 nm insulin gave rise to a characteristic 10-fold increase in glucose transport (Fig. 1A). Neomycin treatment caused a small (24 ± 10%) but significant inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport (p = 0.05). As expected, insulin-stimulated glucose transport was completely abolished by the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (Fig. 1A). However, remarkably, this inhibition of glucose transport by wortmannin was restored by 47 ± 13%, p < 0.005 in the presence of neomycin (Fig. 1A). Neomycin prevented wortmannin inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that an important aspect of insulin-stimulated PI3K activation is the subsequent loss or masking of PIP2. To rule out any interfering effects of neomycin on insulin signaling or on the ability of wortmannin to inhibit PI3K, the phosphorylation and activity of the PI3K effector, PKB, was assessed. As shown in Fig. 2A and quantified in Fig. 2B, in both the presence and absence of neomycin, insulin stimulation results in the significant phosphorylation of serine (S) at postion 473 in PKB when compared with basal conditions (p < 0.0001, n = 4). The magnitude of this response was not different between neomycin-treated and untreated cells. The insulin-dependent PKB phosphorylation seen in both the presence and absence of neomycin is reduced to the same extent by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (84% reduction in the presence and 87% reduction in the absence of neomycin, p < 0.001, n = 4). Thus, neomycin has no effect on insulin stimulation of PKB serine 473 phosphorylation, and furthermore, the inhibition of the insulin-dependent PKB serine 473 phosphorylation seen in the presence of wortmannin is unaffected by neomycin treatment. However, such phosphorylation data does not consider effects on PKB activity. As analysis of PKB phosphorylation is not a direct measure of activity, the ability of immunoprecipitated total cellular PKB to phosphorylate a synthetic peptide substrate (KRPRAATF), under the same treatment conditions used previously, was measured. As shown in Fig. 2C, insulin stimulated a marked rise in PKB activity; the magnitude of this response was similar in neomycin-treated cells (Fig. 2C). As expected, wortmannin treatment caused a marked inhibition of insulin-stimulated PKB activity (54 ± 3%). In agreement with the results of the PKB phosphorylation data (Fig. 2, A and B), neomycin did not prevent the wortmannin-induced inhibition of insulin-stimulated PKB activity (Fig. 2C). Thus, the reversal of wortmannin-inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport is independent of any effects of neomycin on PKB activation. Neomycin Prevents Wortmannin Inhibition of Insulin-dependent Glut4 Translocation to the Plasma Membrane—The results presented in Fig. 1, A and B, clearly demonstrate that neomycin prevents the inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport elicited by wortmannin. As the increased rate of glucose transport promoted by insulin is largely a result of translocation of Glut4 from an intracellular storage compartment to the plasma membrane, we examined the effect of neomycin treatment on Glut4 insertion into the plasma membrane. For this, plasma membrane sheets derived from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, prepared by sonication of cells attached to coverslips, were stained with Glut4 antibody as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 3A shows that plasma membrane sheets prepared from unstimulated cells have only very low levels of Glut4 staining in both the presence and absence of neomycin. Insulin elicited a marked increase in plasma membrane Glut4 content, and interestingly this was further enhanced by neomycin (53 ± 4% increase, p = 0.05, n = 3). As expected, wortmannin treatment resulted in a marked decrease in the insulin-dependent increase in Glut4 levels at the plasma membrane. However, consistent with the glucose transport data, the presence of neomycin prevented wortmannin inhibition of the insulin-dependent increase in plasma membrane Glut4 content. Quantification of the fluorescence intensity from 30 fields of view per condition is shown in Fig. 3B. It is widely accepted that the lipid kinase PI3K plays an essential role in insulin stimulated glucose transport (4Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H.

This is borne out by the complete inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport by the fungal metabolite and specific inhibitor of PI3K, wortmannin (6Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intensive research into the downstream effectors of PI3K activity involved in insulin signaling have resulted in the identification of molecules such as protein kinase B and atypical PKCs that bind PIP3 (13Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 32Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact requirement for these kinases in insulin-stimulated glucose transport is unresolved. Indeed, although PI3K activity is necessary for insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation, the role of PIP3 in this process is not clear. For example, overexpression of the pleckstrin homology domains of GRP-1 or PKB that bind specifically to PIP3 do not prevent insulin-dependent Glut4 translocation and insertion into the plasma membrane (31Tengholm A. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1871-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Clodi M. Vollenweider P. Klarlund J. Nakashima N. Martin S. Czech M.P. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4984-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of the lipid phosphatase PTEN that increased PIP3 levels had no effect on either basal or insulin-stimulated glucose transport (34Ono H. Katagiri H. Funaki M. Anai M. Inukai K. Fukushima Y. Sakoda H. Ogihara T. Onishi Y. Fujishiro M. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we find that treatment of cells with the aminoglycoside, neomycin, prevents the wortmannin inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Neomycin has this effect without influencing the phosphorylation state or activity of PKB, a downstream effector of PI3K, demonstrating that the effects of neomycin are not due to interference with wortmannin action. In addition to the effects on glucose transport, neomycin also prevented wortmannin inhibition of insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation. Interestingly, assessment of Glut4 translocation reveals that the insulin-dependent plasma membrane Glut4 content is increased in the presence of neomycin compared with insulin alone. This increase in insulin-dependent Glut4 content in the presence of neomycin is in contrast with the modest inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport under the same conditions. This difference is also observed between the insulin-stimulated glucose transport rates and Glut4 translocation data from wortmannin-treated cells in the presence of neomycin. Such a difference may indicate that masking of PIP2 with neomycin as well as stimulating Glut4 translocation also has a downstream effect on the activity of the glucose transporter. Nevertheless, the data are consistent in that neomycin prevents the wortmannin-induced inhibition of both insulin-stimulated glucose transport and Glut4 translocation. It is interesting to speculate as to the mechanism by which neomycin elicits these effects on Glut4 translocation and glucose transport. Neomycin is characterized by an affinity to bind phosphoinositides in particular, PIP2 (24Gabev E. Kasianowicz J. Abbott T. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 25Arbuzova A. Martushova K. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Morris A.J. Ozaki S. Prestwich G.D. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Binding of neomycin to PIP2 results in the masking of this lipid (25Arbuzova A. Martushova K. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Morris A.J.

Taken together with our observations, it may be reasoned that the dynamic turnover of PIP2 that takes place on activation of PI3K may be an important signal in stimulating glucose transport. It is important to spell out what dynamic turnover means; in this context we use it to describe a rapid change in the real time depletion and resynthesis of PIP2 brought on by agonist stimulation. The idea that stimulus-dependent dynamic turnover of PIP2 can affect exocytosis has recently been described for insulin secretion by MIN6 cells (35Lawrence J.T.R. Birnbaum M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13320-13325Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and human growth hormone release in PC12 cells (36Aikawa Y. Martin T.F.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In both these systems the involvement of ADP-ribosylation factor-6 in the maintenance of PIP2 levels was important in exocytosis. More directly, other agonists like endothelin-1 and thrombin can elicit an increase in glucose transporter translocation to the plasma membrane and glucose transport, although not to the same extent as insulin (37Lawrence J.T. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5276-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38Heijnen H.F.G. Oorschot V. Sixma J.J. Slot J.W. James D.E. J.

Mallat A. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Goldsmith P. Hanoune J. Lotersztajn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1845-1851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of neomycin to bind PIP2 may mimic the depletion of PIP2, which together with other insulin-dependent signals may be sufficient to stimulate Glut4 translocation and glucose transport. Finally, this study suggests that insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation can proceed in the absence of PKB activation.

It also serves as a means to replicate genomic termini. We reported previously on the reconstitution of a recombination-dependent replication system using purified herpes simplex virus type 1 proteins (Nimonkar A. V., and Boehmer, P. E. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 100, 10201–10206). In this system, homologous pairing by the viral single-strand DNA-binding protein (ICP8) is coupled to DNA synthesis by the viral DNA polymerase and helicase-primase in the presence of a DNA-relaxing enzyme. Here we show that DNA synthesis in this system is dependent on the viral polymerase processivity factor (UL42). Moreover, although DNA synthesis is strictly dependent on topoisomerase I, it is only stimulated by the viral helicase in a manner that requires the helicase-loading protein (UL8). Furthermore, we have examined the dependence of DNA synthesis in the viral system on species-specific protein-protein interactions. Optimal DNA synthesis was observed with the herpes simplex virus type 1 replication proteins, ICP8, DNA polymerase (UL30/UL42), and helicase-primase (UL5/UL52/UL8). Interestingly, substitution of each component with functional homologues from other systems for the most part did not drastically impede DNA synthesis. In contrast, recombination-dependent replication promoted by the bacteriophage T7 replisome was disrupted by substitution with the replication proteins from herpes simplex virus type 1. These results show that although DNA synthesis performed by the T7 replisome is dependent on cognate protein-protein interactions, such interactions are less important in the herpes simplex virus replisome.

Villani G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 75: 139-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Replication of the viral genome occurs in the nuclei of infected cells and requires at least seven virus-encoded proteins as well as several cellular factors (reviewed in Refs. 1Boehmer P.E. Villani G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 75: 139-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar and 2Boehmer P.E. Nimonkar A.V. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The viral genome possesses distinct origins of replication and encodes an origin binding protein (UL9), which is highly suggestive of an initial θ-mode of replication (1Boehmer P.E. Villani G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 75: 139-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the failure to detect genomic DNA ends shortly after infection hints at the possibility that the viral genome circularizes immediately upon infection and replicates via a θ-mode to generate circular intermediates (1Boehmer P.E. Villani G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 75: 139-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The observation of high molecular weight viral DNA later during the life cycle (3Severini A. Scraba D.G. Tyrrell D.L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3169-3175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prompted the suggestion that replication switches to a rolling circle or σ-mode to produce head-to-tail concatamers that are subsequently cleaved into unit length genomes and packaged (2Boehmer P.E. Nimonkar A.V. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This strategy for replication, resembling that adopted by bacteriophage λ (4Enquist L.W. Skalka A. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 75: 185-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), has been considered the “dogma” for HSV-1 replication for more than 2 decades. However, recent evidence indicates that circularization of the genome is not a requisite for lytic viral replication and that the template for replication is in fact a linear genome (5Jackson S.A. DeLuca N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7871-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that the strategy of HSV-1 replication resembles more that of bacteriophages T4 and T7 (6Luder A. Mosig G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1101-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Richardson C.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 315-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Replication of a linear genome possesses an intrinsic problem, replication of the genomic termini. In T4, this is overcome by using recombination-dependent replication (RDR) in which the end of one genome invades into a homologous region of another and utilizes it as a template to complete lagging strand synthesis (6Luder A. Mosig G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1101-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Such a mode of replication would generate highly branched replication intermediates that are commonly seen in HSV-1-infected cells (3Severini A. Scraba D.G. Tyrrell D.L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3169-3175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).During the later stages of HSV-1 replication, the genome recombines at a high frequency, with a rate estimated to be 0.6%/kb of genome (8Smiley J.R. Wagner M.J. Summers W.P. Summers W.C. Virology. 1980; 102: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition to recombination acting to replicate the ends of the linear genome, it may also act to repair double-strand DNA breaks (DSB). The HSV-1 genome possesses sites called a sequences that are recombination hotspots and are cleaved by endonuclease G to introduce DSB (9Wohlrab F. Chatterjee S. Wells R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6432-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Huang K.J. Zemelman B.V. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21071-21079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The a sequence-mediated cleavage of the genome is thought to be involved in genome isomerization (10Huang K.J. Zemelman B.V. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21071-21079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DSB may also be generated as a consequence of oxidative damage induced upon infection (11Valyi-Nagy T. Olson S.J. Valyi-Nagy K. Montine T.J. Dermody T.S. Virology. 2000; 278: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Milatovic D. Zhang Y. Olson S.J. Montine K.S. Roberts II, L.J. Morrow J.D. Montine T.J. Dermody T.S. Valyi-Nagy T. J. Neurovirol. 2002; 8: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).HSV-1 encodes its own replication machinery that consists of a single-strand DNA-binding protein (SSB) (ICP8), DNA helicase-primase (UL5/UL52 core enzyme and UL8 loading protein), and DNA polymerase (pol) (UL30 catalytic subunit and UL42 processivity factor) (2Boehmer P.E. Nimonkar A.V. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These factors have been shown to associate into a replisome that is capable of long chain leading and lagging strand synthesis (13Skaliter R. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10665-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Rabkin S.D. Hanlon B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4957-4967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Falkenberg M. Lehman I.R. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3896-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We recently proposed a model for RDR in HSV-1 based on the ability of HSV-1-encoded factors to catalyze such reactions in vitro (16Nimonkar A.V. Boehmer P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10201-10206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In our model, processing of DSB allows ICP8 to pair single-stranded (ss) donor DNA with complementary duplex DNA resulting in the formation of displacement loops (D-loops). These D-loops nucleate the assembly of the viral replisome that promotes long chain DNA synthesis in the presence of a DNA-relaxing enzyme (16Nimonkar A.V. Boehmer P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10201-10206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A schematic representation of the reaction is shown in Fig. 1A.In this work, the ability of the HSV-1 replication proteins to promote DNA synthesis on D-loops (i.e. RDR) was examined in greater detail. Furthermore, we investigated the requirement for species-specific protein-protein interactions during HSV-1 RDR by replacing the HSV-1 replication proteins with their functional counterparts from other systems. Our results indicate that HSV-1 RDR exhibits a less stringent requirement for species-specific protein-protein interactions when compared with T7 RDR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzymes and Reagents—Escherichia coli SSB (E-SSB), T4 gene 32 protein (gp32), and calf thymus DNA topoisomerase I (Topo I) were purchased from U.

Its concentration was determined by using an extinction coefficient of 939,208.1 m–1 cm–1 at 260 nm. PB11 was 5′-32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified using Sephadex G-25 (fine) quick spin columns (Roche Applied Science). pUC18 form I was isolated from Brij58-lysed cells followed by anion exchange (Q high (Bio-Rad)) as described previously (23Nimonkar A.V. Boehmer P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5275-5281Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The DNA was further treated with 0.1 m NaOH, followed by neutralization and extraction with the Promega Wizard Plus DNA purification system. All DNA concentrations are expressed in moles of molecules.D-loop Formation—PB11 (10.5 nm) was preincubated with ICP8 or gp2.5 (250 nm) on ice for 8 min in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, and 100 μg/ml BSA. The pairing reaction was initiated by adding pUC18 form I DNA (3.5 nm), and incubation was continued for 30 min at 30 °C. D-loops were purified by extraction with the Promega Wizard DNA clean-up system followed by removal of excess unannealed oligonucleotide by gel filtration through Chroma Spin + TE-1000 columns (BD Biosciences).DNA Synthesis Using Pre-formed D-loops—DNA synthesis reactions with purified D-loops were performed in a buffer containing 16.7 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 6.7 mm magnesium acetate, 0.66 mm DTT, 2.5 mm ATP, 500 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP, and 66 μg/ml BSA. Unless otherwise stated, purified D-loops (0.6 nm) were supplemented with mixture A (400 nm ICP8, 5 nm UL30, 5 nm UL42, 10 nm UL5/UL52, 30 nm UL8, and 2.5 units of Topo I) or mixture B (200 nm gp2.5, 5 nm T7 gp5/Th, 10 nm T7 gp4, and 2.5 units of Topo I).

The final concentration of plasmid DNA in the reaction was 2.33 nm of which ∼15% were D-loops. The reaction products were resolved by two-dimensional native-denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis (16Nimonkar A.V. Boehmer P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Each reaction was resolved in duplicate in the first dimension through 0.75% agarose-Tris acetate EDTA, pH 7.6, gels at 9 V/cm for 2 h. Under these conditions, free 100-mer migrates out of the gel. One of the lanes was used as a reference to visualize products resolved in the first dimension. The other lane was excised, soaked in buffer containing 50 mm NaOH and 1 mm EDTA, embedded in a second gel composed of 1% agarose in 50 mm NaOH and 1 mm EDTA, and electrophoresed at ∼2 V/cm for 7 h. Following electrophoresis the gels were dried onto DE81 chromatography paper (Whatman), analyzed, and quantitated by storage phosphor analysis with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 820 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSLong Chain Synthesis during RDR Requires the UL42 Processivity Factor—We had demonstrated previously the requirement for the heterodimeric HSV-1 pol (UL30 and UL42) during RDR (16Nimonkar A.V.

Thus, purified D-loops were supplemented with increasing concentrations of UL30 or UL30/UL42, along with ICP8, helicase-primase, and Topo I. As shown in Fig. 1B, UL30 failed to generate full-length products (2686 nt) at concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 nm (lanes 1–6). Nevertheless, UL30 by itself could promote primer extension with increasing concentrations (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–6), leading to the formation of intermediates up to ∼1000 nt in length. On the other hand, the presence of equimolar UL42 enabled full-length synthesis (lanes 7–12), with complete products forming at UL30/UL42 concentrations as low as 5 nm (Fig. 1B, lane 9). Therefore, subsequent experiments were performed using UL30/UL42 at 5 nm.RDR Is Topo I-dependent and Stimulated by Helicase—We stated previously (16Nimonkar A.V. Boehmer P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10201-10206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that efficient RDR is dependent on Topo I as well as helicase action. Here we examined the requirement for both proteins in more depth. Thus, purified D-loops were supplemented with increasing concentrations of helicase-primase in the absence and presence of Topo I, along with ICP8 and UL30/UL42. In the absence of Topo I, at helicase-primase concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 nm, only marginal DNA synthesis was observed (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–5). On the other hand, the presence of Topo I enabled full-length synthesis (Fig. 2A, lanes 6–10). Approximately 4% (∼33% of maximum) of the primer within the D-loop was extended to full length even in the absence of helicase-primase (Fig. 2A, lane 6). The presence of helicase-primase nevertheless stimulated the reaction ∼3-fold (Fig. 2B) and also increased the length of intermediates (Fig. 2A, compare lane 6 with lanes 7–10). Optimal RDR was observed with 2.5 units of Topo I (data not shown).Fig. 2RDR is Topo I-dependent and stimulated by helicase. Reactions were performed with purified D-loops and increasing UL5/UL52/UL8 concentrations, in the absence and presence of Topo I, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” followed by one-dimensional denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis.

The data show that synthesis of longer intermediates (>500 nt) in the presence of helicase-primase was dependent on UL8 (Fig. 3, lane 2). In its absence, only shorter intermediates (<500 nt), as observed with Topo I alone, were synthesized (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 3). Similar observations were made at a variety of UL5/UL52 concentrations (data not shown). Based on these data, subsequent experiments were performed using 2.5 units of Topo I, 10 nm UL5/UL52, and 30 nm UL8.Fig. 3UL8 increases the efficiency of primer utilization by helicase-primase during RDR. Reactions were performed with purified D-loops as described under “Experimental Procedures,” followed by one-dimensional denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Lane 1, reaction in the absence of UL5/UL52 and UL8; lane 2, reaction in the presence of UL5/UL52 (10 nm) and UL8 (30 nm); lane 3, reaction in the presence of UL5/UL52 (10 nm). The positions of 100-mer, full-length (FL) extension products (2686 nt), intermediates, and markers (HindIII-digested λ DNA) are as indicated. The three reactions were performed, electrophoresed simultaneously, and cropped from the same image.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Importance of Species-specific Protein-Protein Interactions during RDR—The preceding experiments established the role of the various HSV-1 factors in our RDR system. To ascertain whether species-specific protein-protein interactions are important for efficient RDR, we performed a series of experiments wherein each of the HSV-1 replication components was replaced by its counterpart from a variety of systems. First, we substituted ICP8 with SSBs from other systems, namely hRP-A, E-SSB, T4 gp32, and T7 gp2.5. Fig. 4 depicts the results of this experiment. The concentrations of SSBs used in the experiment were twice that required to coat the D-loops, based on the site sizes of the SSBs on ssDNA (24Gourves A.S. Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Boehmer P.E.

In the absence of SSB, most replication products accumulated as intermediates (<500 nt) and less than ∼1% of the primer reached full length (Fig. 4, lane 1). In the presence of ICP8, ∼15% of the primer was extended to full length (Fig. 4, lane 2). Substitution of ICP8 with hRP-A, E-SSB, and T4 gp32 generated full-length DNA molecules with little difference in efficiency (Fig. 4, lanes 3–5), except for gp32 that only promoted full-length synthesis to approximately half the level seen with ICP8 (Fig. 4, compare lanes 2 and 5). However, there was an abundance of small intermediates (100–500 nt) with the heterologous SSBs compared with ICP8 (Fig. 4, compare lane 2 with lanes 3–5). Most interesting, substitution of ICP8 with T7 gp2.5 completely abolished full-length synthesis and only permitted synthesis of short (<250 nt) intermediates (Fig. 4, lane 6). It should be noted that gp2.5 was able to stimulate the extension of singly primed M13 ssDNA by the T7 pol (data not shown), indicating that the protein was active. Moreover, results similar to those described were obtained for the various SSBs at a variety of concentrations (data not shown).Fig. 4Heterologous SSBs with the exception of T7 gp2.5 can support HSV-1 RDR. Reactions were performed with purified D-loops as described under “Experimental Procedures,” followed by one-dimensional denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Where indicated, ICP8 was replaced with the following SSBs: hRP-A, E-SSB, T4 gp32, and T7 gp2.5. The concentrations of the SSBs were 2-fold in excess to those required to coat the D-loops present in the reaction (0.6 nm). Lane 1, no SSB; lane 2, 400 nm ICP8; lane 3, 150 nm hRP-A; lane 4, 150 nm E-SSB; lane 5, 600 nm T4 gp32; lane 6, 600 nm T7 gp2.5. The positions of 100-mer, full-length (FL) extension products (2686 nt), intermediates, and markers (HindIII-digested λ DNA) are as indicated. The % full-length extension products are shown below the lane numbers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We then tested the effect of substituting the 5′–3′ unwinding activity of the HSV-1 helicase-primase with other helicases of like and opposing polarities. The helicases used in this experiment were the 5′–3′ helicases T4 Dda and T7 gp4 and the 3′–5′ helicases SV40 TAg and HSV-1 UL9, all of which have known functions in replication (29Jongeneel C.V.

The concentrations of all the helicases used in this experiment exhibited the same activity in unwinding a 100-mer annealed to M13 ssDNA (data not shown). Consistent with the observation made in Figs. 2 and 3, full-length products were generated in the absence of helicase (Fig. 5, lane 1), albeit less efficiently. The most striking effect was obtained upon replacing helicase-primase with Dda, where substitution prevented full-length synthesis, i.e. inhibited the helicase-independent extension reaction, and only led to limited primer extension (Fig. 5, compare lanes 1 and 2). Control reactions showed that this concentration of Dda efficiently unwound a 100-mer annealed to M13 ssDNA (data not shown). Fig. 5 also shows that substitution of helicase-primase (lane 4) with the other helicases, i.e. T7 gp4 (lane 3), TAg (lane 5), and UL9 (lane 6) decreased the efficiency of full-length DNA synthesis and led to the accumulation of short intermediates (<500 nt). Similar effects were observed at various concentrations of each helicase (data not shown).Fig. 5Heterologous helicases with the exception of T4 Dda can support HSV-1 RDR. Reactions were performed with purified D-loops as described under “Experimental Procedures,” followed by one-dimensional denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Where indicated, UL5/UL52/UL8 was replaced with the following helicases: Dda, T7 gp4, TAg, and UL9. Lane 1, no helicase; lane 2, Dda; lane 3, T7 gp4; lane 4, UL5/UL52/UL8; lane 5, TAg; lane 6, UL9. The concentration of each helicase was 12.5 nm. The positions of 100-mer, full-length (FL) extension products (2686 nt), intermediates, and markers (HindIII-digested λ DNA) are as indicated. The % full-length extension products are shown below the lane numbers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Finally, we studied the effect of replacing the dimeric HSV-1 pol (UL30/UL42) with heterologous pols. The enzymes tested were the replicative pols from T7 (gp5/Th) and E. coli (pol III). The concentration of the pols used was standardized by determining the amounts required to completely extend a 100-mer annealed to M13 ssDNA (in the presence of coating concentrations of T4 gp32 as SSB) (data not shown). In the absence of a pol, no extension was observed, thereby demonstrating the necessity for this activity during RDR (Fig. 6, lane 1). UL30/UL42 (Fig. 6, lane 2) as well as T7 gp5/Th (lane 3) were both capable of supporting RDR with comparable efficiency. E. coli pol III on the other hand only supported limited primer extension, generating products up to ∼200 nt and failing to generate full-length products (Fig. 6, lane 4). Similar results were obtained with higher concentrations of the pols (data not shown).Fig. 6T7 pol but not E. coli pol III can support HSV-1 RDR. Reactions were performed with purified D-loops as"
