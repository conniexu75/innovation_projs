https://openalex.org/W1992557354,"Perlecan is a modular heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is localized to cell surfaces and within basement membranes. Its ability to interact with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) suggests a central role in angiogenesis during development, wound healing, and tumor invasion. In the present study we investigated, using domain specific anti-perlecan monoclonal antibodies, the binding site of bFGF on human endothelial perlecan and its cleavage by proteolytic and glycolytic enzymes. The heparan sulfate was removed from perlecan by heparitinase treatment, and the ~450-kDa protein core was digested with various proteases. Plasmin digestion resulted in a large fragment of ~300 kDa, whereas stromelysin and rat collagenase cleaved the protein core into smaller fragments. All three proteases removed immunoreactivity toward the anti-domain I antibody. We showed also that perlecan bound bFGF specifically by the heparan sulfate chains located on the amino-terminal domain I. Once bound, the growth factor was released very efficiently by stromelysin, rat collagenase, plasmin, heparitinase I, platelet extract, and heparin. Interestingly, heparinase I, an enzyme with a substrate specificity for regions of heparan sulfate similar to those that bind bFGF, released only small amounts of bFGF. Our findings provide direct evidence that bFGF binds to heparan sulfate sequences attached to domain I and support the hypothesis that perlecan represents a major storage site for this growth factor in the blood vessel wall. Moreover, the concerted action of proteases that degrade the protein core and heparanases that remove the heparan sulfate may modulate the bioavailability of the growth factor.

These membranes are highly specialized structures that control tissue architecture, movement of cells/compounds between the bloodstream and tissues(1.Iozzo R.V. Cohen I.R. Grassel S. Murdoch A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 625-639Google Scholar), and the binding of growth factors(2.Vlodavsky I. Bar-Shavit R. Korner G. Fuks Z. Rohrbach D.H. Timpl R. Molecular and Cellular Aspects of Basement Membranes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1993: 327-343Google Scholar). The presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the extracellular matrix of cultured endothelial cells was first demonstrated in 1987(3.Baird A. Ling N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 428-435Google Scholar). Subsequently, its release was shown to be modulated by the action of heparitinase or by competition with heparin(4.Bashkin P. Doctrow S. Klagsbrun M. Magnus Svahn C. Folkman J. Vlodavsky I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Google Scholar), thus suggesting that the growth factor was bound to a HS component present in the matrix. Radiolabeled bFGF was also shown to bind ECM and be released by the enzyme collagenase (4.Bashkin P. Doctrow S. Klagsbrun M. Magnus Svahn C. Folkman J. Vlodavsky I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Google Scholar), thrombin(5.Benezra M. Vlodavsky I. Ishaimichaeli R. Neufeld G. Barshavit R. Blood. 1993; 81: 3324-3331Google Scholar), or plasmin (6.Saksela O. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 767-775Google Scholar) and by incubation with unlabeled growth factor(3.Baird A. Ling N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 428-435Google Scholar). When bound to HS, bFGF was found to be resistant to the action of proteases(7.Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 743-751Google Scholar). Recently, perlecan was shown to bind bFGF and to present the growth factor to its high affinity receptors on the cell surface, which suggested that this HSPG has an important role in the regulation of cell growth(8.Aviezer D. Hecht D. Safran M. Eisinger M. David G. Yayon A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1005-1013Google Scholar). When perlecan was treated with heparinase I it could no longer act as a co-receptor, suggesting that it was the HS on perlecan that was responsible for this activity(8.Aviezer D. Hecht D. Safran M. Eisinger M. David G. Yayon A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1005-1013Google Scholar). This is not surprising in light of the fact that both acidic and basic FGF bind avidly to the closely related glycosaminoglycan, heparin. bFGF bound to heparin-Sepharose requires a NaCl concentration greater than 1 M for elution(3.Baird A. Ling N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 428-435Google Scholar, 9.Vlodavsky I. Folkman J. Sullivan R. Fridman R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Sasse J. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2292-2296Google Scholar). Highly sulfated regions of heparin contain a bFGF-binding hexasaccharide sequence, which is comprised of two trisulfated disaccharides with the structure IdceA (2-OSO3)α1-4GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) followed by an IdceA (2-OSO3)α1-4 anhydro-D-mannitol(10.Tyrrell D.J. Ishihara M. Rao N. Horne A. Kiefer M.C. Stauber G.B. Lam L.H. Stack R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4684-4689Google Scholar). A similar sequence has been identified in HS isolated from fibroblasts (11.Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Google Scholar) and from smooth muscle cells(12.Habuchi H. Suzuki S. Saito T. Tamura T. Harada T. Yoshida K. Kimata K. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 805-813Google Scholar), except that in both cases the proportion of the disulfated GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) was lower, suggesting that the presence of the sulfate groups at position 6 of the N-sulfated glucosamine were not involved in mediating the high affinity binding. HS isolated from whole arterial tissue, which inhibited the growth of smooth muscle cells(13.Schmidt A. Yoshida K. Buddecke E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19242-19247Google Scholar), probably by interfering with the presentation of bFGF to its high affinity receptors(14.Nugent M.A. Karnovsky M.J. Edelman E.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 1051-1060Google Scholar), had a high proportion of the sequence isolated from fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. When the proportion of the IdceA (2-OSO3)α1-4GlcNSO3 disaccharide was decreased with respect to the amount of the IdceA (2-OSO3)α1-4GlcNSO3(6-OSO3), the fraction did not inhibit smooth muscle cell growth(13.Schmidt A. Yoshida K. Buddecke E. J. Biol.

The protein core of perlecan has been divided into five domains on the basis of sequence homology to other proteins and the presence of repeating motifs(15.Murdoch A.D. Dodge G.R. Cohen I. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8544-8557Google Scholar, 16.Kallunki P. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 559-571Google Scholar). Domain I is unique to perlecan and contains three serine-glycine-aspartic acid sequences that may act as glycosaminoglycan attachment sites(16.Kallunki P. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 559-571Google Scholar). Since these HS chains are needed for perlecan to bind FGF, the integrity of domain I is important for anchoring the growth factor activity to the ECM. We reasoned that if this domain were degraded or released by proteases, it could provide a mechanism whereby anchored growth factor molecules could be liberated. It has also been suggested that domain I may be oriented toward the cell surface, which would facilitate its co-receptor activity(17.Couchman J.R. Woods A. Roberts D.D. Mecham R.P. Cell Surface and Extracellular Glycoconjugates: Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 33-82Google Scholar). Domain II has sequence homology to the low density lipoprotein receptor, domain III has homology to the A chain of laminin, domain IV is composed of immunoglobulin-like repeats that demonstrate homology to the neural cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM, and domain V has regions that have similarity to epidermal growth factor and the globular domains of the laminin A chain(15.Murdoch A.D. Dodge G.R. Cohen I. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8544-8557Google Scholar). The fact that bFGF binds a HSPG in the matrix and is released by enzymes such as plasmin, thrombin, heparanase, and collagenase has been known for a number of years. The identity of the HSPG responsible for this binding, however, was unknown until recently when it was shown that perlecan bound bFGF(8.Aviezer D. Hecht D. Safran M. Eisinger M. David G. Yayon A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1005-1013Google Scholar). The major goal of this paper was to investigate which enzymes would degrade the protein component of perlecan and whether these same enzymes could facilitate the release of the bound bFGF. This was facilitated by the use of anti-perlecan monoclonal antibodies, which were characterized with respect to their domain specificity. Plasmin, stromelysin, and rat collagenase significantly degraded the protein core, reduced the immunoreactivity toward domain I, and released significant amounts of the growth factor from the HSPG. Plasmin cleaved the protein core to leave a product that probably contained domain III, whereas stromelysin and rat collagenase degraded perlecan core protein into many fragments. Heparitinase I released bound bFGF, whereas heparinase I did not, a finding consistent with the substrate specificity of heparinase I for highly sulfated regions of heparan sulfate. Platelet extract was the most efficient agent at releasing bound growth factor, and this may be due to the presence of many HS-degrading enzymes. This supports the hypothesis that degranulation of platelets at sites of injury may be very effective at mobilizing growth factor from the matrix, thereby aiding in the wound healing process.

Human stromelysin-1 (MMP 3) purified from fibroblasts was supplied by Dr. Jack Windsor from the University of Alabama in Birmingham, Alabama. It degraded gelatin and casein by SDS-zymography. Human gelatinases (MMP 2 and MMP 9) from 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-stimulated HL-60 cells were supplied by Dr. Guy Lyons at the Kanematsu Institute, Royal Prince Alfred hospital, Sydney. The presence of active gelatinases was assayed by zymographic analyses. Rat collagenase was purified from rat mammary carcinoma cells as described previously (18.Lyons J.G. Nethery A. O'Grady R.L. Harrop P.J. Matrix. 1989; 9: 7-16Google Scholar) and supplied by Ms. A. Martorana from the University of Technology, Sydney. It was shown to degrade collagen using a dried collagen film assay (19.Nethery A. Lyons J.G. O'Grady R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 390-395Google Scholar) and gelatin by zymographic analysis. The human homologue of rat collagenase has been named collagenase-3 (MMP 13)(20.Freije J.M.P. Diez-Itza I. Balbin M. Sanchez L.M. Blasco R. Tolivia J. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 16766-16773Google Scholar). The platelet extract was a gift from Dr. Lloyd Graham of the CSIRO, Division of Biomolecular Engineering, and had a protein concentration of 9 mg/ml. One ml was prepared from 1.2 × 1011 platelets by freeze-thawing. This extract was assayed and shown to contain significant heparin/heparan sulfate-degrading activity using both a labeled and nonlabeled substrate assay(21.Graham L.D. Mitchell S.M. Underwood P.A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 37: 239-246Google Scholar). Human TIMP-1 was a gift from Dr. Kirby Bodden from the University of Alabama in Birmingham, Alabama. The anti-perlecan monoclonal antibodies were the result of a fusion using Sp2/0 myeloma cells and spleen cells from mice immunized with whole bovine corneal endothelial cell ECM, described previously(22.Underwood P.A. Bennett F.A. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 641-649Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies A71, A74, A76, and A81 and irrelevant mouse IgG control were purified from ascites fluid by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose, as described(23.Underwood P.A. Kelly J.F. Harman D.F. McMillan H.M. J. Immunol. Meth. 1983; 60: 33-45Google Scholar). The anti-human domain III monoclonal antibody, 7B5, was produced and characterized as described previously(24.Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 239-249Google Scholar). It was supplied as lyophilized ascites fluid, which was reconstituted with water before use. Fusion proteins specific for perlecan domains II, III, and V were produced as described previously(24.Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 239-249Google Scholar). An additional fusion protein consisting of bacterial maltose binding protein fused to domain I of perlecan (bases 144-659 of the cDNA(15.Murdoch A.D. Dodge G.R. Cohen I. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8544-8557Google Scholar)) was also used in this study. For ELISA, fusion proteins were purified over amylose resin columns as before(24.Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 239-249Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, crude bacterial lysates were obtained by boiling pelleted bacteria in SDS-PAGE sample buffer prior to electrophoresis. Primary cultures of human umbilical arterial endothelial cells (HUAECs) were prepared from fresh umbilical cords delivered by caesarean section at Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, as described (25.Weis J.R. Sun B. Rodgers G.M. Thromb. Res. 1991; 61: 171-173Google Scholar) using 0.1% bacterial collagenase. Cells were grown on tissue culture plastic precoated for 2 h at 37°C with chicken fibronectin (10 μg/ml), purified from fresh plasma by affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose as described(26.Ruoslahti E. Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M. Engvall E. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 803-831Google Scholar). Culture medium was Medium 199 with Earle's Salts containing 20% pyrogen-free fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml heparin, and 2% bovine brain extract prepared as described (27.Maciag T. Cerundolo J. Ilsley S. Kelley P.R. Forund R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5674-5678Google Scholar). Cells were passaged at a 1:3 split ratio after disaggregation with 0.125% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA and used between passages 6 and 10. Radiolabeled conditioned medium was prepared by culturing endothelial cells with either [35S]sodium sulfate (25 μCi/ml) or [35S]methionine (25 μCi/ml) in complete medium for up to 72 h. The labeled medium was collected, centrifuged at 2000 × g to remove cellular debris and stored at −20°C. Human endothelial cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates at 0.5-1 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 7 days in complete medium to allow deposition of ECM on the surface of the wells. Native ECM was prepared using the method of Gospodarowicz and Lui(28.Gospodarowicz D. Lui G.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1981; 109: 69-81Google Scholar). The ECM coated plates were stored at −20°C under phosphate-buffered saline until used. Native ECM ELISAs were performed as described previously (29.Underwood P.A. Dalton B.A. Steele J.G. Bennett F.A. Strike P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 833-845Google Scholar) using biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG and peroxidase conjugated to streptavidin to enhance the signal. ABTS substrate reaction absorbance was read at 405 nm in a Bio-Rad plate reader. The reference wavelength was 490 nm. Plates coated with the various fusion proteins at 2 μg/ml were washed and incubated with freshly made 0.05% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% lactose for 1 h at room temperature. This solution was removed, and the plates were drained and allowed to dry at room temperature for 4 h. The plates were stored at room temperature both while in transit and until used. ELISAs performed on the fusion proteins used peroxidase conjugated directly to rabbit anti-mouse IgG instead of using biotin and streptavidin enhancement. For immunoprecipitation, protein A-Sepharose was saturated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (RAM) by incubating 1 ml of a 50% suspension with 200 μl of the antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature with rocking. The RAM-saturated protein A-Sepharose was washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) to remove unbound RAM, and TBS was added to give a final volume of 1 ml (50% suspension). Samples (1 ml) of radiolabeled HUAEC conditioned medium were precleared by a 2-h incubation at room temperature with 100 μl of RAM-saturated protein A-Sepharose suspension. Simultaneously, 100-μl samples of RAM-saturated protein A-Sepharose suspension were incubated with 200 μl of purified monoclonal antibody (mAb) in TBS at 100 μg/ml. The mixtures were microcentrifuged, and the mAb-loaded protein A-Sepharose was washed twice with TBS and resuspended in the precleared medium. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature with shaking, the protein A-Sepharose was washed four times with TBS and resuspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer (10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4% (w/v) SDS, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 10 mM Tris, pH 6.8), boiled for 10 min, and microcentrifuged to pellet the protein A-Sepharose. The supernatant was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels, dried, exposed to a phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics) and imaged on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using ImageQuant software. Immunoprecipitation of labeled bFGF-perlecan complexes was achieved using the same protocol as described above except that the HUAEC conditioned medium was not labeled and recombinant 125I-labeled bFGF was added to give a final activity of 0.2 μCi/ml of medium before precipitation with mAb-loaded protein A-Sepharose. Treatment of the labeled bFGF-perlecan-mAb-protein A-Sepharose complexes with NaCl or heparin was performed at room temperature for 16 h. Treatment with degradative enzymes was for 16 h at 37°C (as described below). After all treatments, the samples were microcentrifuged, and the supernatants were removed, counted in a γ counter (LKB 1275 Minigamma), and expressed as counts/μl/min. The remaining pellet was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis. The amount of labeled bFGF released by the various treatments was expressed as a percentage of the amount bound in the initial immunoprecipitate, which was estimated by extraction of the immunoprecipitate with 6 M urea, 0.2% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline. The values were corrected for the amount of 125I-labeled bFGF released by buffer alone by applying the following formula: corrected % = (uncorrected % - buffer only %) × 100/(100 - buffer only %). Digestions with heparitinase I, heparinase I, or chondroitinase ABC were performed at 37°C for 16 h in 10 mM Hepes, 3 mM Ca(CH3COO)2, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.0, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM ε-amino caproic acid, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as described by Lindblom et al.(30.Lindblom A. Lars-Ake F. Glycoconjugate J. 1990; 7: 545-562Google Scholar). Digestion with human plasmin, human thrombin, rat collagenase, or human stromelysin was performed using the same buffer without the addition of the protease inhibitors for 16 h at 37°C. The activity of these proteases was titrated against native matrix using the ELISA approach. The concentration of enzymes chosen was the minimum concentration that gave 100% of the degradative activity as demonstrated using the anti-domain V antibody, A74. In the cases of heparitinase I and platelet extract, reasonable maximum concentrations were selected. The final concentrations of the various enzymes were as follows: heparitinase I and heparinase I, 0.1 unit/ml; chondroitinase ABC, 0.5 units/ml; plasmin, 0.6 units/ml; thrombin, 1.2 units/ml; rat collagenase, 5 μg/ml; gelatinases, 1 μg/ml; and stromelysin, 2 μg/ml. Platelet extract was used at a final concentration of 90 μg/ml in enzyme buffer either with or without added protease inhibitors. For all enzyme digestions the aim was to perform exhaustive cleavage on the substrate in an attempt to demonstrate an absolute presence or absence of cleavage. Enzyme digestions of immunoprecipitated molecules were performed after the four washes with TBS in a volume of 50 μl and were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling the samples for 10 min. Enzyme digestions of native ECM were also performed in a volume of 50 μl in the wells of the microtiter plates using the same conditions and final concentrations of enzymes. The plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline prior to analysis by ELISA. SDS-PAGE was performed using 4-15% polyacrylamide gradient gels as described by Laemmli(31.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the gels were washed with 25% (v/v) ethanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid in H2O to remove any SDS and stained with 0.125% (w/v) Alcian blue in 25% (v/v) ethanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid in H2O for 30 min at room temperature. After staining, the gels were destained using 25% (v/v) ethanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid in H2O. The gels were dried, and radioactive bands were visualized using a PhosphorImager system. Crude bacterial lysates for Western blotting analysis were size separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions before transfer to nitrocellulose membrane(32.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibody and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate with nitro blue tetrazolium as substrate. We have isolated a number of monoclonal antibodies directed toward endothelial matrix. Four such mAbs (A71, A74, A76, and A81) were specific for perlecan. The SDS gel profile of the immunoprecipitate of [35S]methionine or [35S]sulfate-labeled HUAEC conditioned medium with A76 is shown in Fig. 1(lanes 1 and 4, respectively). The immunoprecipitated molecule only just entered the 4-15% polyacrylamide gel, consistent with the expected size of perlecan. When [35S]sulfate-labeled perlecan was digested with heparitinase I, the high molecular weight band disappeared (Fig. 1, lane 5), indicating that all the incorporated label was present as HS. When the [35S]methionine-labeled perlecan was digested with heparitinase I, the labeled band moved further into the gel (Fig. 1, lane 2), yielding an estimate of the molecular mass of the protein core of human perlecan as 450 kDa. Chondroitinase ABC digestion had no effect on either the intensity or the mobility of either [35S]sulfate-labeled (Fig. 1, lane 6) or [35S]methionine-labeled endothelial cell-derived perlecan (Fig. 1, lane 3). Incubation with both heparitinase I and chondroitinase ABC gave the same results as those for heparitinase I alone (data not shown), supporting the suggestion that human endothelial perlecan contained only HS and no CS. The mobility of the protein core was unaffected by reduction with 10 mM dithiothreitol (data not shown). Results from immunoprecipitation experiments using any of four mAbs were identical (data not shown). The four antibodies reacted, by ELISA, with perlecan in native HUAEC matrix (data not shown). To determine further the specificity of the antibodies, they were screened by Western blotting and ELISA against recombinant fusion proteins encoding domains I, II, III, and V of the perlecan protein core. The fusion proteins were generated as bacterial maltose-binding protein fusions as described previously(24.Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 239-249Google Scholar). Western blotting demonstrated that A71 reacted specifically with domain I (Fig. 2A, lane 1), whereas A74 (lane 2), A76 (lane 3), and A81 (lane 4) did not react with the domain I fusion protein (Fig. 2A). There was some evidence of nonspecific reactivity with A71 and A76 (Fig. 2A). All four antibodies were negative on Western blots to domain II, III, or V (data not shown). By ELISA, A71 reacted with domain I (Fig. 2B), which supported the results obtained by Western blotting, and A74 reacted with domain V (Fig. 2B). Both A76 and A81 showed no significant immunoreactivity (data not shown). In summary, these data indicate that we have specific monoclonal antibodies directed against different protein domains of perlecan.Figure 2:Characterization of anti-perlecan antibodies using domain fusion proteins. A, crude lysates from Escherichia coli that were expressing a domain I fusion protein were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with 2 μg/ml of A71 (lane 1), A74 (lane 2), A76 (lane 3), or A81 (lane 4). A71 recognized a major band of approximately 66 kDa as well as some minor domain I components. These are indicated by the arrow. B, fusion proteins containing domain I, II, III, or V of perlecan purified from E. coli. were coated onto wells of an ELISA plate at 2 μg/ml and probed with 2 μg/ml of mAbs.

LPDII transfection of KB cells, a cell line overexpressing the tumor marker folate receptor, was affected by both the lipid to DNA ratio and the lipid composition. At low lipid to DNA ratios (e.g. 4 and 6), LPDII particles were positively charged; transfection and cellular uptake levels were independent of the folate receptor and did not require a pH-sensitive lipid composition. Meanwhile, transfection and uptake of negatively charged LPDII particles, i.e. those with high lipid to DNA ratios (e.g. 10 and 12), were folate receptor-dependent and required a pH-sensitive lipid composition. The transfection activity of LPDII was lost when the inverted cone-shaped DOPE was replaced by dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine. LPDII particles with lipid to DNA ratios of 4, 6, 10, and 12 were ~20-30 times more active than DNA•3-β-[N-(N′,N′-dimethylethane)carbamoyl]cholesterol cationic liposome complexes in KB cells and were much less cytotoxic. On the sucrose gradient, LPDII particles had a migration rate in between those of the free DNA and the DNA•polylysine complex.

Further analysis showed that full-length Raf-1 bound to both phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid (PA). Specifically, a carboxyl-terminal domain of Raf-1 kinase (RafC; residues 295-648 of human Raf-1) interacted strongly with phosphatidic acid. The binding of RafC to PA displayed positive cooperativity with Hill numbers between 3.3 and 6.2; the apparent Kd ranged from 4.9 ± 0.6 to 7.8 ± 0.9 mol % PA. The interaction of RafC with PA displayed a pH dependence distinct from the interaction between the cysteine-rich domain of Raf-1 and PA. Also, the RafC-PA interaction was unaffected at high ionic strength. Of all the lipids tested, only PA and cardiolipin exhibited high affinity binding; other acidic lipids were either ineffective or weakly effective. By deletion mutagenesis, the PA binding site within RafC was narrowed down to a 35-amino acid segment between residues 389 and 423. RafC did not bind phosphatidyl alcohols; also, inhibition of PA formation in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells by treatment with 1% ethanol significantly reduced the translocation of Raf-1 from the cytosol to the membrane following stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate.

We found a large induction of all three TGF-β isoforms and also of TGF-β types I and II receptors, although the time course of induction and the absolute expression levels were different for these genes. Furthermore, each TGF-β isoform had distinct sites of expression in the wound. Systemic treatment with glucocorticoids significantly altered the expression levels of TGF-βs and TGF-β receptors.

Using a catalytically inactive mutant (D168A) of human CSBP2 as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified and cloned a novel kinase which shares~70% amino acid identity to mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase (MAPKAP kinase)-2, and thus was designated MAPKAP kinase-3. The binding of CSBP to MAPKAP kinase-3 was confirmed in vitro by the precipitation of epitope-tagged CSBP1, CSBP2, and CSBP2(D168A) and endogenous CSBP from mammalian cells by a bacterially expressed GST-MAPKAP kinase-3 fusion protein and in vivo by co-precipitation of the epitope-tagged proteins co-expressed in HeLa cells. MAPKAP kinase-3 was phosphorylated by both CSBP1 and CSBP2 and was then able to phosphorylate HSP27 in vitro. Treatment of HeLa cells with sorbitol or TNF resulted in activation of CSBP and MAPKAP kinase-3 and activation of MAPKAP kinase-3 could be blocked by preincubation of cells with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of CSBP kinase activity. These data suggest that MAPKAP kinase-3 is activated by stress and cytokines and is a novel substrate of CSBP both in vitro and in vivo."

This unique diacylglycerol kinase may terminate signals transmitted through arachidonoyl-DAG or may contribute to the synthesis of phospholipids with defined fatty acid composition. Diacylglycerol occupies a central position in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and triglycerides. It also is an important intracellular messenger because it can bind to and activate protein kinase C, which, in turn, phosphorylates target proteins(1.Kikkawa U. Kishimoto A. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 31-44Google Scholar). This pathway has been implicated in many cellular response including growth, differentiation, and other events such as secretion. The mechanisms by which the signaling pathway and the synthesis of complex lipids are differentially regulated is not clear, but the concentration of DAG 1The abbreviations used are: DAGdiacylglycerolDGKdiacylglycerol kinaseHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsPSphosphatidylserinePCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)MOPS4-morpholinopranesulfonic acid. within the cell is almost certainly one important component. In response to a variety of signals, the DAG level rises by the activation of one or more phospholipases C and, in some cases, a phospholipase D followed by phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase. Either pathway causes a rise in the amount of diacylglycerol by degrading phospholipids. The level of DAG also is influenced by the rate at which it is converted into other products. One pathway for decreasing DAG is its conversion to phosphatidic acid, a reaction catalyzed by DAG kinases (EC 2.7.1.107). diacylglycerol diacylglycerol kinase human umbilical vein endothelial cells phosphatidylserine polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) 4-morpholinopranesulfonic acid. The stimulated rise in DAG levels is an integral component of the response of cells to a variety of stimuli that lead to growth or differentiation, and the effects of phorbol esters, which are tumor promoters, are through activation of protein kinase C. Thus, the level of DAG may be an important determinant of growth. In support of this, we found that rapidly growing endothelial cells have severalfold higher levels of DAG than quiescent cells, and others observed that transformation of cells by several oncogenes results in an increased content of DAG even in the absence of an additional stimulus(2.Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Google Scholar, 3.Wolfman A. Wingrove T.G. Blackshear P.J. Macara I.G. J. Biol.

The conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid may dampen such signals, but the precise effects on cellular behavior are hard to predict because phosphatidic acid also may influence the growth response(5.Moolenaar W.H. Kruijer W. Tilly B.C. Verlaan I. Bierman A.J. de Laat S.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 171-173Google Scholar, 6.Ahmed S. Lee J. Kozma R. Best A. Monfries C. Lim L. J. Biol.

Another role of the DAG kinase reaction may be to resynthesize phosphatidylinositol, which, unlike most phospholipids, has a characteristic fatty acid composition: 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl(8.Holub B.J. Kuksis P.W. Adv. Lipid Res. 1978; 16: 1-125Google Scholar). The mechanism for achieving this composition has never been elucidated although one possibility is that an enzyme(s) in the synthetic, or a salvage, pathway are specific for precursors with the appropriate molecular composition. Following the stimulated turnover of phosphatidylinositol, there is a later rise in phosphatidic acid, which has been thought to be the result of a DGK-catalyzed reaction. If this enzyme were specific for arachidonate-containing species of DAG, then multiple cycles might progressively enrich phosphatidylinositol with arachidonate. The first isoform of DAG kinase characterized at a molecular level, DGKα, has a molecular mass of about 80 kDa (9.Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T.

Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21155-21164Google Scholar) reported the purification of DAG kinase from bovine testis and found it to have a molecular mass of 58 kDa. This activity was highest in testis, followed by brain and spleen. The purified enzyme showed a marked preference (up to 20-fold) for 1,2-DAG with arachidonate at the sn-2 position. In the experiments reported here, we discovered a novel isoform of DAG kinase by molecular cloning of a cDNA from an endothelial cell library. When expressed in mammalian cells, it gives an enzyme that is specific for arachidonate-containing DAG. This enzyme, which we have named DGKɛ, may have an important role in signaling by regulating the concentration of DAG.

A. 1993; 90: 11157-11161Google Scholar). Total RNA from confluent HUVEC monolayers was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate method(20.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Single strand cDNA was synthesized with 1 μg of total RNA from HUVEC at 37°C for 1 h using oligo(dT)15 as the primer and M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reverse transcription mixture was then used as the template in the PCR amplification which was performed as follows: 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 75 s, 53°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 2 min, and concluding with a 5-min incubation at 72°C. The amplified PCR fragment (about 750 bp) was gel-purified and subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene) that had been cut with EcoRV and had a single T added (T-vector)(21.Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 19: 1154Google Scholar). The cloned fragments were subjected to sequence analysis by the dideoxy chain termination method using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The cloned DGK fragment with a novel sequence was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by PCR and used as a probe to screen a HUVEC λgt11 cDNA library kindly provided by Dr. Evan Sadler (Washington University, St. Louis). The plaques were transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham) and hybridized overnight at 65°C in a solution containing 5 × Denhardt's, 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. The filters were washed once in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and once in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 20 min. Approximately 4 × 106 plaques were screened. Positive clones were subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) and sequenced on both strands by the automated dideoxy method (ABI, University of Utah Cancer Center Core Sequencing Facility). COS-7 transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and all steps were followed by the protocol provided by the manufacturer. After 2.5 days, the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication (twice with 5 watts for 5 s at 4°C) in the lysis buffer (0.1 ml/35 mm well) containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 4 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a 20 μg/ml concentration of each: leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor(13.Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the cell homogenate was determined with the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). In two experiments, we also separated the homogenate into soluble and membrane-bound fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min (4°C). The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer, and both fractions were assayed for DGK activity. Since the full-length cDNA of DGKɛ could not be expressed in COS-7 cells (discussed under “Results and Discussion”), a PCR product of the DGKɛ cDNA lacking the 3′-untranslated region and part of the 5′-untranslated region was amplified and cloned into pcDNAI/Neo (Invitrogen). The forward primer, 5′-GCATAAGCTCGATATCGAGGTATCGTCCTTG-3′ (GP-3) contained 10 random nucleotides, an EcoRV site (underlined), and 15 nucleotides complementary to nucleotide −21 to −7 of DGKɛ. The reverse primer, 5′-TTGTCTCGAGGTCGACATCTATTCAGTCGCC-3′ (GP-4) contained 10 random nucleotides, a SalI site (underlined), and 15 nucleotides complementary to nucleotide 1692-1706 of DGKɛ. The PCR amplification was performed as follows: 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min and 30 s for 5 cycles, followed by 94°C for 30 s, 65°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min and 30 s for 30 cycles using Pfu (Stratagene) DNA polymerase. The PCR product was gel-purified, cut with EcoRV/SalI, and cloned into the EcoRV/XhoI site of pcDNAI/Neo (Invitrogen). The octyl glucoside/PS mixed-micelle assay of DGK activity was performed as described(17.Walsh J.P. Suen R. Lemaitre R.N. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21155-21164Google Scholar). In brief, the assay mixture contained 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM diacylglycerol, 3.5 mM phosphatidylserine, 75 mM octyl-β-glucopyranoside, 500 μM [γ-32P] ATP, and 20 μg of cellular protein in a volume of 200 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P] ATP (20-30 μCi/μmol) and processed for 10 min at 24°C. To stop the reaction, we added 1 ml of MeOH, 1 ml of CHCl3, 0.7 ml of 1% perchloric acid, and 50 μg of phosphatidic acid as carrier. The lower phase of each sample was washed twice with 2 ml of 1% perchloric acid and then dried. They were resuspended in 100 μl of 9:1 CHCl3/MeOH and separated by thin layer chromatography (20 × 20 cm Silica 60A plates; Whatman). The plates were developed in (325:75:25) CHCl3/MeOH/HOAc. The region containing phosphatidic acid was scraped, and the radioactivity was estimated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The amount of phosphatidic acid formed per reaction was calculated by dividing the radioactivity in phosphatidic acid by the specific radioactivity of the ATP in the reaction. Multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from Clontech. The ApaI/SalI fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1582-2470 of DGKɛ was gel-purified and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Hybridization was carried out in QuikHyb (Stratagene). The conditions of hybridization and washing were as described in the protocol provided by the manufacturer. In previous experiments we had observed increased DGK activity as endothelial cells became quiescent (22.Whatley R.E. Stroud E.D. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16130-16138Google Scholar). To identify the enzyme(s) responsible for the increased activity, we carried out reverse transcription-PCR using degenerate primers and total RNA from confluent cultures of human endothelial cells. We cloned and sequenced 29 PCR products; 20 were identical with human DGKα (10.Schaap D. de Widt J. van der Wal J. Vandekerckhove J. van Damme J. Gussow D. Ploegh H.L. van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Bend R.L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 151-158Google Scholar). However, we also found two novel DGKs; they contained the conserved sequences that the PCR strategy was designed to detect, but otherwise had unique primary structure. One of the PCR products, which had a length of 761 bp, was named DGKζ and will be reported separately.2 The other novel product had a length of 746 bp, and we designated it DGKɛ. This PCR fragment was used as a probe to screen a cDNA library from human endothelial cells. Of two million plaques screened, there was one positive, DGKE1 (Fig. 1A). The 5′- portion of DGKE1 was subsequently used as the probe in another round of screening, which yielded two more positive clones (out of 2 × 106), DGKE2 and DGKE3 (Fig. 1A), all of which were sequenced. The cDNA of DGKɛ has an open reading frame encoding 567 amino acids including the initiator methionine (calculated Mr = 63,884) (Fig. 1B). The translation initiation codon corresponds well with the Kozak sequence (23.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar). However, in the clones shown, we did not detect in-frame stop codons in the 5′-untranslated region, nor were there typical polyadenylation signals in the 3′-untranslated region. Thus, the full-length messenger RNA for this enzyme is likely to be larger than the clone we isolated (see below). In a subsequent experiment, we screened a library from human testis (Clontech) and isolated another DGKɛ clone with a longer 5′ region, and an in-frame stop codon was found at position −129 from the initiating methionine (data not shown). DGKɛ has 34%, 36%, 36%, and 32% identity with human DGKα(10.Schaap D. de Widt J. van der Wal J. Vandekerckhove J. van Damme J. Gussow D. Ploegh H.L. van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Bend R.L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 151-158Google Scholar), rat DGKβ(12.Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Google Scholar), human DGKγ(13.Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Google Scholar), and human DGKζ,2 respectively. However, DGKɛ clearly differs from the other cloned DGKs as it does not contain the N-terminal conserved region and E-F hand sequences found in other mammalian DGKs (Fig. 2). Moreover, the two zinc finger-like cysteine-rich sequences (residues His60-Cys108 and His125-Cys177, Fig. 1B) found in DGKɛ have distinctive patterns; the sequence of the first is Cys-X2-Cys-X9-Cys-X2-Cys-X7-Cys-X9-Cys, while the second has the sequence: Cys-X2-Cys-X14-Cys-X2-Cys-X7-Cys-X9-Cys. These precise zinc finger motifs are not found in any other DGKs, or in protein kinases C. In particular, the number of amino acids separating the last two cysteines in both the first and the second zinc finger-like motifs is 9 in DGKɛ instead of 5-8 in most other mammalian DGKs or protein kinases C (the other novel DGK that we identified,2 DGKζ, also is unusual in that it has 9 and 10 amino acids separating the two final cysteines in the two motifs). These features make DGKɛ unique among the known DGKs. However, the catalytic domain, which is in the C-terminal region of DGKɛ, contains two putative ATP binding motifs (Fig. 1B) and is moderately conserved: the percent identity of amino acids in this region is 41%, 42%, 42%, and 38% with human DGKα(10.Schaap D. de Widt J. van der Wal J. Vandekerckhove J. van Damme J. Gussow D. Ploegh H.L. van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Bend R.L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 151-158Google Scholar), rat DGKβ(12.Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Google Scholar), human DGKγ(13.Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Google Scholar), and human DGKζ,2 respectively. We subcloned the full-length cDNA of DGKɛ into the XhoI site of pcDNAI/Neo and transfected it into COS-7 cells. In our initial experiments, we could not detect DGK activity after transient expression (data not shown). We considered the possibility that this result was caused by rapid degradation of the mRNA since the 3′-untranslated region of DGKɛ contains A/T-rich sequences, which have been shown to confer instability. To examine this, we deleted the entire 3′-untranslated region and part of the 5′-untranslated region, cloned it into pcDNAI/Neo, and transfected it into COS-7 cells. With this construct, we obtained a marked increase in DGK activity compared to cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 3A). In addition, the activity in the DGKɛ-transfected cells was highly selective for 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol as compared to other DAGs. However, the activity and substrate preference of DAG kinases can depend greatly on the type of assay system chosen(17.Walsh J.P. Suen R. Lemaitre R.N. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21155-21164Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the substrate preference of this isoform was an artifact of the assay system, we compared the utilization of different molecular species of DAG in the same assay but with different isoforms: the E. coli DGK, DGKɛ, and DGKζ. As shown in Fig. 3B, only DGKɛ was selective for arachidonoyl-DAG, which confirms that the substrate preference is an intrinsic property of this isoform. We also tested the effects of phosphatidylserine on the activity of DGKɛ as it has been shown variously to activate(16.MacDonald M.L. Mack K.F. Richardson C.N. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1575-1583Google Scholar, 24.Kanoh H. Yamada K. Sakane F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 47-50Google Scholar) or inhibit(17.Walsh J.P. Suen R. Lemaitre R.N. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21155-21164Google Scholar). Our assay contained phosphatidylserine, so we cannot make a direct comparison with previous results, but the inclusion of an additional 3.5 mM phosphatidylserine only slightly increased the activity of DGKɛ (data not shown). We also tested whether two compounds, R59022 and R59949, that inhibit some, but not all, isoforms of DGK(24.Kanoh H. Yamada K. Sakane F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 47-50Google Scholar), had any effect on DGKɛ. The activity in homogenates from transfected cells was inhibited by approximately 11% and 41% in the presence of 100 μM R59022 or R59949, respectively. Thus, DGKɛ does not seem to be a primary target for these inhibitors. We also found that the majority (83%) of the DGKɛ activity was in the supernatant fraction when the homogenate was separated by centrifugation (data not shown). This may indicate that this is a different enzyme than that studied by Walsh et al.(17.Walsh J.P. Suen R. Lemaitre R.N. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21155-21164Google Scholar), as theirs appeared to be a membrane protein. However, our result should be interpreted cautiously as the recovery of enzymatic activity in the supernatant + pellet fractions was only 42% of the total in the homogenate. The basis for this loss is not clear since a sample of DGKζ handled identically gave complete (>99%) recovery. We screened multiple human tissues by Northern blotting and found that DGKɛ is expressed in testis, at a lower level in ovary, and at a barely detectable level in skeletal muscle and pancreas (Fig. 4). The mRNA band of DGK detected in Northern blotting (about 8 kb, Fig. 4) is much larger than the cDNA we cloned (2557 bp), which suggests that the 5′-untranslated and/or the 3′-untranslated region(s) of the messenger RNA is (are) very long. The enzyme encoded by the cDNA that we isolated, DGKɛ, is distinctive compared to other known DGKs as it is very selective for arachidonoyl-DAG. The basis for this property is not clear. The distinctive zinc finger-like structures, which likely are the sites for DAG binding, may contribute to the substrate specificity, but DGKζ, which does not have the arachidonoyl-DAG specificity, has similar sequences. A DAG kinase with such specificity might play an important role in phospholipid metabolism by producing a precursor of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, that is enriched in arachidonic acid. Multiple cycles of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and resynthesis could lead to progressive enrichment in arachidonic acid. However, DGKɛ seems unlikely to serve this function generally as it has a very restricted pattern of expression. However, it is possible that other tissues have very low level expression, below what we could detect by Northern blotting, since the arachidonate-specific DGK activity has been reported previously in aortic endothelium(25.Severson D.L. Hee-Cheong M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 976-983Google Scholar). Alternatively, there could be another isoform with similar substrate preference."

To determine if MAPK activation is sufficient for acquisition of the molecular and morphological features of cardiac hypertrophy we compared four agonists that stimulate G protein-coupled receptors. Whereas phenylephrine and endothelin transactivate cardiac-specific promoter/luciferase reporter genes, increase atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) expression, and promote myofilament organization, neither carbachol nor ATP induces these responses.

Furthermore, the kinetics of MAPK activation are not different for the hypertrophic agonist phenylephrine and the nonhypertrophic agonist carbachol.

Moreover, PD 098059, an inhibitor of MAPK kinase, blocked phenylephrine-stimulated MAPK activity but not ANF reporter gene expression.

Here we show that Cbl associates with all three forms of the human Crk protein, predominantly CrkL, following T cell receptor activation of Jurkat T cells. Association between Cbl and Crk proteins was confirmed in normal human peripheral blood-derived T cells. In vitro, Cbl was able to interact with the Crk SH2 domain but not the SH3 domain.

https://openalex.org/W1988074381,"In the present study we examine the role of transmembrane aromatic residues of the δ-opioid receptor in ligand recognition. Three-dimensional computer modeling of the receptor allowed to identify an aromatic pocket within the helices bundle which spans transmembrane domains (Tms) III to VII and consists of tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan residues. Their contribution to opioid binding was assessed by single amino acid replacement: Y129F and Y129A (Tm III), W173A (Tm IV), F218A and F222A (Tm V), W274A (Tm VI), and Y308F (Tm VII). Scatchard analysis shows that mutant receptors, transfected into COS cells, are expressed at levels comparable with that of the wild-type receptor. Binding properties of a set of representative opioids were examined. Mutations at position 129 most dramatically affected the binding of all tested ligands (up to 430-fold decrease of deltorphin II binding at Y129A), with distinct implication of the hydroxyl group and the aromatic ring, depending on the ligand under study. Affinity of most ligands was also reduced at Y308F mutant (up to 10-fold). Tryptophan residues seemed implicated in the recognition of specific ligand classes, with reduced binding for endogenous peptides at W173A mutant (up to 40-fold) and for nonselective alkaloids at W274A mutant (up to 65-fold). Phenylalanine residues in Tm V appeared poorly involved in opioid binding as compared with other aromatic amino acids examined. Generally, the binding of highly selective δ ligands (TIPPψ, naltrindole, and BW373U86) was weakly modified by these mutations. Noticeably, TIPPψ binding was enhanced at W274A receptor by 5-fold. Conclusions from our study are: (i) aromatic amino acid residues identified by the model contribute to ligand recognition, with a preponderant role of Y129; (ii) these residues, which are conserved across opioid receptor subtypes, may be part of a general opioid binding domain; (iii) each ligand-receptor interaction is unique, as demonstrated by the specific binding pattern observed for each tested opioid compound.

Opiates are strong analgesic compounds currently used in the treatment of pain. They also have euphoriant action and strong addictive properties. Opiates, as well as endogenous opioid peptides, exert their biological action through three classes of membrane receptors, known as μ, δ, and κ. The recent cloning of three genes encoding these receptors (for a review, see (1.Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol.

The binding site of GPRs which recognize small biogenic amines has been best characterized(4.Hibert M.F. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Bruinvels A. Hoflack J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 8-15Google Scholar). Three-dimensional computer modeling relying on bacteriorhodopsin structure as a scaffold and the analysis of amino acid conservation in sequence alignments were used in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis data to identify residues which interact with the small nonpeptidic ligands. The binding site was shown to lie within the helical bundle, about 15 Å from the extracellular surface and spanning Tms II to VI, with a central role for Tm III. Other GPRs bind peptide ligands with sizes ranging from tripeptides (e.g. N-formyl peptide or thyrotropin-releasing hormone) to proteins (follicle-stimulating, luteinizing, and thyroid-stimulating hormones). Mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that, in addition to transmembrane residues, extracellular domains participate in ligand recognition (for reviews, see (5.Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Google Scholar) and (6.Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotech. 1994; 5: 434-444Google Scholar)), indicating that the peptide binding site extends beyond the transmembrane pocket for these receptors. Opioid receptors are GPR family members endowed with an extremely large ligand repertoire(7.Rees D.C. Hunter J.C. Emmet J.C. Opioid Receptors. Pergamon Press, New York1990: 805-846Google Scholar). They bind a wide variety of structurally diverse molecules, including small rigid alkaloid compounds, synthetic peptides, as well as a family of endogenous peptides. Opioid receptors are therefore expected to interact with their ligands at multiple sites, both extracellular and intramembranous, an assumption which is supported by initial point mutagenesis and chimeric studies(8.Kong H.

We have focused on the role of transmembrane domains in the δ receptor. In a previous study, we have demonstrated that the conserved Asp residue in Tm III, although not interacting directly with the positive charge of opioid ligands, is critically involved in maintaining intact binding properties of the receptor(19.Befort K. Tabbara L. Bausch S. Chavkin C. Evans C. Kieffer B. Mol. Pharm. 1996; 49: 216-223Google Scholar). Other reports have shown implication of charged residues found in Tm II and Tm VI in opioid recognition(8.Kong H. Raynor K. Yasuda K. Moe S.T. Porthoghese P.S. Bell G.I. Reisine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23055-23058Google Scholar, 9.Surratt C.K. Johnson P.S. Moriwaki A. Seidleck B.K. Blaschak C.J. Wang J.B. Uhl G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20548-20553Google Scholar). In this study, we have used our knowledge from studies of other GPRs and receptor modeling to establish a putative topology of the receptor binding site. We have identified a number of aromatic amino acid residues as candidates for opiate recognition and we have examined the contribution of their side chains to the binding of a large set of structurally distinct opiate molecules, using a site-directed mutagenesis approach. We provide evidence that a cluster of aromatic residues may represent a major area of interaction for most ligands. In addition our results demonstrate a distinct mode of interaction for each ligand under investigation, ruling out the possibility of a unique opioid binding site. All ligands tested were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Bremazocine was from Research Biochemicals International and BW373U86 was kindly provided by K. J. C. Chang (Burroughs Wellcome Co., Research Triangle park, NC); TIPP and TIPPψ were provided by Astra Pain Control (Montreal, Canada); [3H]naltrindole (specific activity; 44.5 Ci/mmol) was provided by A. Borsodi (Szegued, Hungary), and [3H]diprenorphine (specific activity, 37 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Corp. The modeling procedure has been previously described in detail for the modeling of the angiotensin AT II receptor (20.Joseph M. Maigret B. Bonnafous J.-C. Marie J. Scheraga H.A. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 381-398Google Scholar). Briefly, the mDOR three-dimensional model was constructed following a three-step strategy: (i) a model of the human rhodopsin receptor was built from the resolved structure of bacteriorhodopsin (21.Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Google Scholar); (ii) from that, a model of the best well studied hamster β2-adrenergic receptor was built from the obtained human rhodopsin model using a sequence alignment that results from homologies existing between all GPR Tm regions. Many amino acid guide points could be retained in each Tm helix to allow next pertinent use of homology building procedures. As for the building of the opsin receptor, only the seven Tm were built. (iii) This β2-adrenergic receptor model was finally used as a template for the modeling of the mouse δ-opioid receptor itself. The whole modeling was performed with the BIOSYM software using the “Insight Discover,” and “Homology” modules (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA). mDOR cDNA (3.Kieffer B.L. Befort K. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Hirth C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12048-12052Google Scholar) was subcloned in HindIII-BamHI sites of the mammalian expression vector pCDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen). Single stranded DNA for mutagenesis was prepared from pCDNA-mDOR using the helper phage M13KO7 (Promega) and the Escherichia coli strain NM 522 (Stratagene) and was used as template for site-directed mutagenesis. Sequences of oligodeoxynucleotides were chosen to replace the following residues of mDOR receptor either by phenylalanine: Tyr129 (Tm III) and Tyr308 (Tm VII) or by alanine: Tyr129 (Tm III), Trp173 (Tm IV), Phe218 and Phe222 (Tm V), Trp274 (Tm VI). Oligodeoxynucleotides containing the mutant codon were annealed to the single-stranded template, followed by an elongation with the Klenow fragment and ligase. Heteroduplex plasmid DNA was then used to transform the repair-deficient E. coli strain BMH71-18 mutS (Clontech). Transformants were selected by growth on LB plates supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and mutations were confirmed by manual DNA sequencing (Sequenase kit; U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in both directions. Sequences were also confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (373A DNA, Perkin-Elmer) using fluorescently labeled nucleotides (Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit, Perkin-Elmer). COS-1 cells (1.5 × 106 cells/140-mm dish) were transfected with purified plasmids (35 μg/dish) using the DEAE-dextran method. After 72 h growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, the cells were harvested and membranes were then prepared as described previously(3.Kieffer B.L. Befort K. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Hirth C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12048-12052Google Scholar). For binding experiments, various amounts of membrane proteins of mDOR and mutant receptors, ranging from 20 to 100 μg, were diluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and incubated for 1 h at 25°C with opioid ligands in a final volume of 0.5 ml. For saturation experiments, eight concentrations of [3H]diprenorphine ranging from 0.05 to 10 nM (for WT, Y129F, W173A, F218A, Y308F) and eight concentrations of [3H]naltrindole ranging from 0.1 to 12 nM (for WT, Y129A, F222A, W274A) were used. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 2 μM (for WT and F218A), 0.1 mM (for Y129F, W173A, and Y308F), or 0.5 mM (for Y129A, F222A, and W274A) naloxone. For competition studies, membrane preparations were incubated with [3H]diprenorphine (1 nM for WT, Y129F, F218A and 2 nM for W173A and Y308F) or [3H]naltrindole (2 nM for Y129A, F222A, Y308F), in the presence of variable concentrations of opioid competing ligands. When using endogenous peptides as competitors, assays were conducted in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, antipain, and chymostatin, each at 2.5 mg/ml). Kd, Ki, and Bmax values were calculated using the EBDA/Ligand program (G. A. McPherson, Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Opioids are cationic compounds with strong hydrophobic character. Structure-function studies have shown that a positively charged nitrogen atom located at a fixed distance from a phenolic ring, a common structure between alkaloids and opioid peptides, represents the active or “message” part of opioid molecules (see (22.Barnard E.A. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 211-214Google Scholar)). The positive charge being an absolute requirement for ligand binding, the existence of a salt bridge has long been postulated to be the major interaction between the ligand and its receptor site. In preliminary work(19.Befort K. Tabbara L. Bausch S. Chavkin C. Evans C. Kieffer B. Mol. Pharm. 1996; 49: 216-223Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that this interaction occurs at Asp128 in mDOR. This negatively charged residue is present in Tm III of all GPRs that bind small cationic neurotransmitters and is known to interact directly with catecholamines in the β2-adrenergic receptor. Our results showed that, although this Asp residue is a structural component of the binding site, it does not interact directly with opioid ligands. Another study has shown that Asp95 (Tm II), the only other anionic residue present in transmembrane domains, does not represent a common attachment point for opioids(8.Kong H. Raynor K. Yasuda K. Moe S.T. Porthoghese P.S. Bell G.I. Reisine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23055-23058Google Scholar). The lack of evidence for a main electrostatic interaction between opioids and the δ receptor strengthens the hypothesis that non-ionic interactions are predominantly responsible for ligand chelation in the binding site. We have used three-dimensional computer modeling to identify intramembranous amino acid residues that may face the inner side of the helices bundle and account for ligand binding. Interestingly, we found that the best candidates are predominantly aromatic residues, and their side chains are presented on Fig. 1. On the model we observe that Trp173, Phe218, Phe222, and Trp274 are clustered and form an aromatic pocket spanning Tms IV, V, and VI. The putative binding site extends over Tms III and VII, where residues facing the pore acquire a more hydrophilic character. Among these, the amphiphilic Tyr308 residue seems to bridge Tm VII and Tm III. Hydrophilic residues have also been identified as putative anchor points for ligand on this model, such as Asn131 and His278 (not shown) or Asp128 (Tm III), which we have investigated earlier. In the empty receptor, some of the identified aromatic residues seem to be in close contact with other amino acid side chains. Trp274 may interact with Phe270 within Tm IV through aromatic-aromatic interaction. Polar interhelices interactions may also be seen with a possible interaction of the OH group of Tyr308 or the indole NH group of Trp274 with the carbonyl of Asp128 via hydrogen bonds. Residue Tyr129, which is adjacent to the critical Asp 128 residue, does not face the binding pocket in this model, but rather participates in reinforcing helical III intrinsic stability through aromatic-aromatic interactions occurring between Tyr129, Phe148, and Phe137. Interestingly, in another model of mDOR derived from bovine opsin crystallographic data, 2M. Hibert, personal communication. the side chain of Tyr129 seems more likely to be located inside the pore due to a different position of Tm III relative to adjacent helices. In addition, this tyrosine residue is present in muscarinic m3 and TRH receptors and was shown to play a critical role in ligand recognition(23.Wess J. Maggio R. Palmer J.R. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19313-19319Google Scholar, 24.Perlman J.H. Thaw C.N. Laakkonen L. Bowers C.Y. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1610-1613Google Scholar). We therefore have included examination of the role of Tyr129 in our study despite its outside positioning in our model. Point mutant receptors constructed in this study are shown on Fig. 2. We have replaced the identified tryptophan (Tms IV and VI) and phenylalanine (Tm V) residues by alanine (W173A, F218A, F222A, and W274A), thus removing the side chains which seem to constitute the aromatic pocket proposed by the model. We have modified the tyrosine residues in Tms III and VII into phenylalanines (Y129F and Y308F) to evaluate the possible contribution of the hydroxyl groups. Finally we have replaced tyrosine 129 by alanine (Y129A) to remove the entire phenol moiety and ascertain the role of this aromatic ring in Tm III. We then have examined the binding properties of each mutant receptor. Since opiates and opioid peptides constitute a group of compounds with high structural diversity, we have tested a repertoire of ligands with representative molecules in each class, including endogenous peptides, synthetic peptide analogues, or alkaloid compounds, agonists or antagonists, nonselective or δ-selective ligands (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Structure of opioid ligands under study. Amino acid sequences of peptide ligands and chemical structures of alkaloids are shown. TIPP, TIPPψ, naltrindole, naloxone, and diprenorphine are antagonists. Altogether these compounds constitute a representative set of opioid ligands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Plasmids encoding WT and mutant receptors were transiently expressed in COS cells and their ability to bind [3H]diprenorphine, a nonselective antagonist, was assessed by saturation experiments performed on membrane preparations. For three mutant receptors (Y129A, F222A, and W274A) [3H]diprenorphine binding appeared weak. Thus, [3H]naltrindole, another alkaloid antagonist that exhibited nanomolar affinity at these mutants, was used as a radiolabeled ligand. The examination of Bmax values (Table 1) indicates that mutations under study do not drastically modify receptor expression in COS cells. Expression levels of Y129F, Y129A, F218A, and Y308F mutants are not significantly modified, Bmax values at W173A and W274A mutants are slightly decreased (by 4-fold), and expression of mutant F222A is reduced by 15-fold, but radioligand binding remains nevertheless easily detectable. We further established a detailed binding profile for each mDOR mutant receptor. Table 2 summarizes Ki values obtained for each ligand and affinity changes relative to the WT receptor are illustrated in Fig. 4. Each mutant receptor bound at least one ligand with an affinity comparable with that of the WT receptor, suggesting that the general receptor conformation is maintained in the mutated receptors.Tabled 1Tabled 1Figure 4:Binding profile of mutant receptors. The abbreviations used are: β-end, β-endorphin; Dyn A, dynorphin A, Leu-enk and Met-enk, Leu- and Met-enkephalin, respectively; Delt II, deltorphin II; BW, BW373U86; NTI, naltrindole; Brem, bremazocine; and Nalox, naloxone. Histograms represent effect of the mutation on ligand binding with black bars showing the ratio of Ki values at mutant and WT receptors. Value 1 means that the mutation does not modify ligand binding. Results are presented using the same scale for all mutants to underscore the relative contribution of each amino acid residue under study.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mutant Y129F exhibits reduced affinities for the ligands under study, with effects being very modest (2.8-fold for DPDPE) or more significant (12-fold for bremazocine). This result suggests a general contribution of a hydrogen bond to ligand binding. Remarkably, a stronger reduction (91-fold) is observed for deltorphin II, a δ-selective agonist isolated from frog skin which does not contain the canonical YGGF N-terminal sequence typical of opioid peptides and therefore may bind in a distinct manner. For this particular peptide, the OH group of Tyr129 may represent a major anchor point. Further replacement of tyrosine by alanine shows contributions of both the hydroxyl group and the aromatic ring of the tyrosine side chain. Binding of long endogenous peptides (β-endorphin and dynorphin A), a synthetic peptide (TIPPψ) or δ-selective alkaloids (BW373U86 and naltrindole) at Y129A mutant is affected similarly to binding at Y129F mutant, suggesting that the aromatic ring does not contribute to recognition of these compounds. In contrast short endogenous peptides (Leu- and Met-enkephalin), synthetic peptides (DADLE and DPDPE) as well as nonselective alkaloids (bremazocine and naloxone) exhibit affinities for Y129A up to 90-fold lower than those for Y129F. Deltorphin II binding is also reduced 5-fold more and appears as the most affected ligand, with a total decrease in affinity of 430-fold relative to the WT receptor. For these latter compounds, therefore, the aromatic ring of Tyr129 participates in ligand binding. Altogether, these results underscore a general involvement of Tyr129 side chain in ligand recognition, with a distinct contribution of both the OH group and the aromatic ring depending on the ligand under study. Binding of the endogenous peptides β-endorphin, dynorphin A, Leu- and Met-enkephalin at W173A mutant receptor is strongly reduced (21-43-fold), whereas TIPPψ, BW373U86, naltrindole, and bremazocine affinities remain unaffected. Ki values for DADLE and DPDPE significantly decrease, but to a lesser extent (2- and 13.6-fold) relative to natural peptides, indicating that W173 discriminates between endogenous ligands and synthetic peptides. Mutation W274A modifies binding properties of the receptor in a totally different manner. W274A mutant displays highly reduced binding affinities for the two nonselective alkaloid compounds examined in this study, bremazocine and naloxone (up to 65-fold). Affinities are less reduced for other ligands (<10-fold). An interesting feature of this mutation is that it enhances TIPPψ binding (5-fold) and, to this respect, W274A mDOR and TIPPψ represent a unique ligand-mutant receptor couple in this study. Finally, DPDPE is the only compound that appears equally affected by both tryptophane mutations, a particularity which might be correlated to the cyclic structure of this peptide. Thus, removal of indole groups from tryptophan residues 173 and 274 results in a dramatic decrease in affinities for specific classes of ligands. We have investigated the contribution of Tyr308 in Tm VII as a hydrogen bond donor by phenylalanine replacement. A decrease in ligand binding is observed for most ligands (5-10-fold), with the exception of bremazocine, TIPPψ, and Met-enkephalin binding, which remains essentially unaffected. Interestingly, Leu-enkephalin binding is affected by 5-fold, underscoring a distinct mode of interaction for the two highly structurally related enkephalin peptides. Mutant F218A appears weakly involved in ligand binding, since affinities do not decrease more than 5-fold. Binding to the mutant F222A is significantly reduced for two peptidic ligands, DADLE and deltorphin II (14.5- and 13.5-fold decrease affinity). Otherwise all other opioid compounds are less affected (<7-fold). Amino acid substitutions at positions 308, 218, and 222 therefore modify the binding properties of the receptor, although to a lesser extent than mutations at residues 129, 173, and 274. Three-dimensional modeling has allowed us to identify transmembrane aromatic amino acid residues as possible candidates for opioid binding at the δ receptor, and we have investigated their role by site-directed mutagenesis. It is important to note that the mutations under study generally affect the binding of some, but not all investigated opioid ligands. We can therefore assume that structural modifications, that would dramatically change the general conformation of the receptor binding site, do not take place in the mutated receptors. Consequently, our results indicate that amino acid residues Tyr129, Trp173, Phe218, Phe222, Trp274, and Tyr308 indeed participate in ligand recognition. Whether alterations of ligand binding observed in this study arise from the disruption of direct ligand-receptor interactions or rather from subtle effects on helical packing is not known. Compared with other mutations examined in this study, modifications of Tyr129 (Tm III) induce major impairment of ligand binding. This amino acid residue therefore appears as a major component of the binding site. A tyrosine residue is present at homologous position in m3 muscarinic and TRH receptors and was shown critical in ligand recognition for both receptors(23.Wess J. Maggio R. Palmer J.R. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19313-19319Google Scholar, 24.Perlman J.H. Thaw C.N. Laakkonen L. Bowers C.Y. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1610-1613Google Scholar). Thus, in this report, we bring further support for the implication of this particular residue within the seven transmembrane topology. Interestingly, in a previous study (19.Befort K. Tabbara L. Bausch S. Chavkin C. Evans C. Kieffer B. Mol. Pharm. 1996; 49: 216-223Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that the adjacent Asp residue (Asp128) is a critical determinant of the binding site conformation. Therefore, the altered binding properties of Y129A and D128N mutant receptors ((19.Befort K. Tabbara L. Bausch S. Chavkin C. Evans C. Kieffer B. Mol. Pharm. 1996; 49: 216-223Google Scholar) and Fig. 5) indicate that both adjacent Tm III residues play an important role in ligand recognition, consistent with structure-function studies, which indicate that helix III plays a central role in GPRs(6.Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotech. 1994; 5: 434-444Google Scholar). The significant contribution of Tyr129 in ligand binding seems to be in contradiction with its outward orientation in the proposed model (see Fig. 1B). One hypothesis may be that the possible implication of Tyr129 in aromatic stacking suggested by the model (see “Results”) is important to maintain helix III conformation and that Tyr129 plays a structural role. This interpretation, however, is not consistent with the observation that the aromatic ring of Tyr129 does not seem to be involved in the binding of some ligands (β-endorphin, dynorphin A, TIPPψ, BW373U86, and naltrindole), which rather interact with the OH group of the tyrosine residue. A more likely possibility to explain the decreased binding potency of opioid ligands at Y129F and Y129A mutants is that the amino acid side chain faces the inner core of the helices bundle and act as an anchor point for these ligands. Refinement of the model is now required to assess this hypothesis. In particular, revision of the alignment procedure and consideration of mutagenesis data on β2 receptor may lead to repositioning of helix III. Although less drastically involved in receptor binding properties, Tyr308 (Tm VII) contributes significantly to the binding of most ligands tested in this study. This residue is also found in TRH receptor, bradykinin receptor, and in amine binding GPRs and was shown important for agonist and antagonist binding in m3 muscarinic receptor (23.Wess J. Maggio R. Palmer J.R. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19313-19319Google Scholar). Also a histidine residue is present at homologous position in adenosine A1 receptor and mutation into leucine demonstrated its critical role in ligand recognition(25.Olah M.E. Ren H. Ostrowski J. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10764-10770Google Scholar). Finally, position 308 in mDOR corresponds to that of a lysine residue in the opsin family, where it represents the attachment point of retinal, the covalently bound ligand of this receptor family. Thus, the OH group of Tyr308, which seems to be generally involved in opioid binding at the δ receptor, appears to play a role similar to that of homologous residues in other GPRs. Tryptophan residues 173 (Tm IV) and 274 (Tm VI) play a critical role in the binding of specific groups of opioid compounds. These amino acids are highly conserved among GPRs. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown their involvement in ligand recognition at m3 muscarinic receptor for both residues(26.Wess J. Nanavati S. Vogel Z. Maggio R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 331-338Google Scholar), as well as at bovine rhodopsin and angiotensin AT1 receptors for tryptophan residue in Tm VI (27.Nakayama T.A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4269-4275Google Scholar, 28.Yamano Y. Ohyama K. Kikyo M. Sano T. Nakagomi Y. Inoue Y. Nakamura N. Morishima I. Guo D.-F. Hamakubo T. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14024-14030Google Scholar). Our study shows that these two conserved tryptophan residues also play a role in binding at mDOR, consistent with the idea that these residues may represent common binding site determinants in GPRs despite the wide diversity of the ligands. Mutations of phenylalanine residues of Tm V poorly affect ligand binding compared with other mutations examined in this study. Particularly, F218A represents the only mutation in this study that barely affects ligand binding. A phenylalanine residue is also present at this position in other GPRs. At present a role for this amino acid has not been documented, but the involvement of a serine residue, which is found at homologous position in receptors that bind small biogenic amines (Ser204 in β2-adrenergic, Ser199 in D1 dopamine, Ser201 in α2-adrenergic), has been clearly demonstrated. The serine amino acid residue was suggested to interact with the catechol moiety of the ligand, both from three-dimensional modeling studies (4.Hibert M.F. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Bruinvels A. Hoflack J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 8-15Google Scholar) and mutagenesis experiments where a 25-fold affinity decrease is described following serine to alanine substitution (29.Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13572-13578Google Scholar, 30.Pollock N.J. Manelli A.M. Hutchins C.W. Steffey M.E. MacKenzie R.G. Frail D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17780-17786Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Phe218 in the δ receptor does not participate to ligand binding to the same extent as the homologous serine residue in catecholamine receptors. Modification of Phe222 into alanine alters binding potency of a larger number of ligands compared with F218A mutation. Taken together, results from mutations of the two phenylalanine residues in Tm V suggest that Phe222 is located closer to the binding site than Phe218, which is consistent with our model (Fig. 1A). Furthermore the overall weak effect of both F218A and F222A mutations, relative to the important alterations of ligand binding arising from modifications at Tms III, IV, and VI, indicates that opioid ligands interact weakly with Tm V and bind more centrally relative to the putative binding pocket. Our results seem to indicate a correlation between the potency of ligands to interact at mutated receptors and their selectivity degree toward the δ subtype. We have observed that affinity of some highly δ-selective compounds (BW373U86, naltrindole, and TIPPψ) is weakly affected by our set of mutations while binding of compounds with low δ selectivity (bremazocine, naloxone, β-endorphin, and dynorphin A) is altered at most positions and to a larger extent (Fig. 4). This indicates that residues identified in this study constitute major anchor points for nonselective opioids, while additional specific interactions may take place for δ-selective compounds in other regions of the receptor. Our study does not provide evidence for the existence of distinct agonist and antagonist binding sites in the region embedded between Tms III and VII, that we have investigated. Each amino acid substitution affects the binding of at least one agonist and one antagonist, suggesting largely overlapping sites for both ligand types in the transmembrane aromatic domain. Altogether these observations suggest that the set of aromatic residues proposed by our model is not involved in agonist/antagonist- or δ selectivity, but rather constitute a general binding domain for opioids. Consistent with this idea is the fact that all six aromatic amino acids, identified by three-dimensional modeling as potential key residues, are conserved across δ-, μ- and κ-opioid receptors. We might therefore expect these residues to play similar roles in μ and κ receptors, and further mutagenesis experiments may confirm this assumption. Finally, the suggestion that transmembrane aromatic residues examined here are part of a general binding domain raise the possibility that these residues interact with the “message” part of opioid molecules(22.Barnard E.A. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 211-214Google Scholar), which is common to all tested compounds. Further ligand-docking studies on a refined three-dimensional model should provide precise indications in support of this hypothesis. We have used a schematic representation of the putative aromatic site proposed by three-dimensional modeling to illustrate effects of mutations for the binding of each ligand under investigation (Fig. 5). An interesting observation is that the point mutations, altogether, alter the binding of every ligand with a specific pattern. This allows to define a unique binding fingerprint for each ligand and indicates that every opioid compound interacts at the δ receptor using a distinct combination of interactions with aminoacid residues of the binding domain. Indeed, and although two of our mutations allow to group structurally related ligands (W137A and W274A), we clearly observe specific features which make each ligand-receptor interaction unique. These include the striking reduction of deltorphin II binding at Y129F mutant as compared with other ligands, the equal involvement of both tryptophan residues for DPDPE binding only, and the unique property of TIPPψ in binding at W274A mutant with increased affinity. In line with this idea also is the observation of different interaction modes for the two highly similar peptides Leu- and Met-enkephalin. Binding of Met-enkephalin is more reduced at the W173A mutant relative to Leu-enkephalin, while its affinity remains unchanged at Y308F, a mutation that significantly affects Leu-enkephalin binding. Thus, our study demonstrates for the first time that there is no unique binding site for opioids. Evidence has accumulated that aromatic residues may interact with various chemical groups and undergo intra- or intermolecular bonds. Aromatic-aromatic interactions have been suggested to be important in maintaining receptor structure and driving conformational changes in GPRs(31.Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Bruinvels A. Hibert M. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3448-3462Google Scholar). Also, the existence of amine-aromatic interactions between a ligand and its receptor site has been postulated based on crystallographic data for both acetylcholinesterase (32.Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Google Scholar) and the phosphotyrosine recognition SH2 domain of v-src oncogene(33.Waksman G. Kominos D. Robertson S.C. Pant N. Baltimore D. Birge R.B. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Mayer B.J. Overduin M. Resh M.D. Rios C.B. Silverman L. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1992; 358: 646-653Google Scholar), as well as from mutagenesis studies of the tachykinin NK1 receptor(34.Fong T.M. Cascieri M.A. Yu H. Bansal A. Swain C. Strader C.D. Nature. 1993; 362: 350-353Google Scholar). Numerous aromatic residues are present in transmembrane domains of opioid receptors, some of them being conserved in all GPRs(35.Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Google Scholar). Our study shows that the side chains of Tyr129, Trp173, Phe222, Trp274, and Tyr308 residues provide favorable interaction sites for opioid compounds and that their contribution may be distinct from that of their homologous counterparts in other GPRs. Our results further suggest that these transmembrane aromatic residues, which are conserved across opioid receptor subtypes, may represent common anchor points for opioid ligands in the δ receptor. Finally, the overall picture of opioid binding at the mutated receptors supports the idea of a general transmembrane binding domain with no single binding site. Studies of complementary modifications of both receptor and ligand structures, in δ as well as in μ and κ receptors, may help in the future to elucidate the precise mechanisms of ligand-receptor interaction at aromatic residues in transmembrane domains of opioid receptors."

This decrease correlates closely with down-regulation of its mRNA, an effect regulated in part by changes in mRNA stability. Regulation of mRNA stability has been associated with mRNA-binding proteins that recognize A + U-rich elements within the 3′-untranslated regions of many mRNAs encoding proto-oncogene and cytokine mRNAs. We demonstrate here that the mRNA-binding protein, AUF1, is present in both human heart and in hamster DDT1-MF2 smooth muscle cells and that its abundance is regulated by β-AR agonist stimulation. In human heart, AUF1 mRNA and protein was significantly increased in individuals with myocardial failure, a condition associated with increases in the β-adrenergic receptor agonist norepinephrine. In the same hearts, there was a significant decrease (~50%) in the abundance of β1-AR mRNA and protein. In DDT1-MF2 cells, where agonist-mediated destabilization of β2-AR mRNA was first described, exposure to β-AR agonist resulted in a significant increase in AUF1 mRNA and protein (~ 100%). Conversely, agonist exposure significantly decreased (~40%) β2-adrenergic receptor mRNA abundance. Last, we demonstrate that AUF1 can be immunoprecipitated from polysome-derived proteins following UV cross-linking to the 3′-untranslated region of the human β1-AR mRNA and that purified, recombinant p37AUF1 protein also binds to β1-AR 3′-untranslated region mRNA.

Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 497-508Google Scholar) suggest that down-regulation of the endogenously expressed β2-AR mRNA does not appear to be caused by a decrease in the rate of transcription; rather, it appears that agonist exposure decreases the half-life of β2-AR mRNA from approximately 12 to 5 h(8.Hadcock J.R.

For these gene products regulation of mRNA stability has also been associated with the interaction of the mRNA with a family of cytosolic proteins (Mr 30,000-40,000) that often bind to A + U-rich elements (AREs) commonly located within the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the mRNA(28.Malter J.S.

This interaction induces mRNA degradation by mechanisms only partially understood. However, for some mRNAs including those containing AREs(35.Savant-Bhonsale S. Cleveland D.W. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1927-1939Google Scholar, 36.Winstall E. Gamache M. Raymond V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3796-3804Google Scholar), the degradation of mRNA may be associated with the process of translation. The cytosolic A + U-rich mRNA-binding proteins are in general considered to be distinct from other mRNA-binding proteins such as the heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles(37.Dreyfuss G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 459-498Google Scholar, 38.McCarthy J.E.G. Kollmus H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 191-197Google Scholar), however, the role of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles A1 and C proteins as cytoplasmic factors regulating mRNA stability is currently undergoing reassessment(39.Gorlach M. Wittekind M. Beckman R.A. Mueller L. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3289-3295Google Scholar, 40.Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Malter J.S. Arrick B.A. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12787-12793Google Scholar) using cytosolic extracts produced from DDT1-MF2 hamster smooth muscle cells, the properties of a β-AR mRNA-binding protein (β-ARB), which binds to hamster β2-AR and human β1-AR mRNAs, has undergone preliminary characterization. Binding of β-ARB to mRNA was determined to involve regions of the 3′-UTR of the hamster β2-AR mRNA containing an ARE(41.Port J.D. Huang L.-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24103-24108Google Scholar, 42.Huang L.-Y. Tholanikunnel B.G. Vakalopoulou E. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25769-25775Google Scholar). In addition, agonist stimulation of the β-AR pathway or protein kinase A activation by a cAMP analogue resulted in significant up-regulation (3-4-fold) of β-ARB protein as detected by UV cross-linking. Conversely, treatment of DDT1-MF2 cells with dexamethasone, which up-regulates β2-AR mRNA, down-regulated β-ARB by ~50%. Therefore, agents that regulate hamster β2-AR mRNA stability and abundance appear to affect reciprocally the abundance of β-ARB protein. Among the family of G-protein-coupled receptors, the mRNAs of the hamster β2-AR, the human β1- and β2-AR, and the thrombin receptor have all been demonstrated to interact with β-ARB(41.Port J.D. Huang L.-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24103-24108Google Scholar, 42.Huang L.-Y. Tholanikunnel B.G. Vakalopoulou E. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

To date, the identity of β-ARB has remained unresolved. However, β-ARB does share characteristics in common with several described A + U-rich mRNA-binding proteins(41.Port J.D. Huang L.-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24103-24108Google Scholar), including AUF1(31.Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein, AUF1 (A + U-rich element RNA-binding/degradation factor), has recently been cloned and characterized(31.Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar). AUF1 binds to the 3′-UTRs of several highly regulated mRNAs including c-myc, GM-CSF, and c-fos. Furthermore, there is evidence of #x0201C;cause and effect” between AUF1 and regulation of mRNA stability in that partially purified AUF1 can selectively accelerate the degradation of c-myc mRNA in an in vitro mRNA decay system(34.Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we endeavored to determine if AUF1 was expressed in human heart and in DDT1-MF2 cells, and if so, if AUF1 abundance was regulated by stimulation of the β-AR pathway. Here we report that the mRNA encoding AUF1 protein is expressed in both human heart and DDT1-MF2 cells. Furthermore, exposure of DDT1-MF2 cells to β-AR agonist, or high adrenergic drive, as manifest in the failing human heart, results in up-regulation of the AUF1 gene product. In addition, we show that purified, recombinant p37AUF1 protein binds to an ARE within the 3′-UTR of the human β1-AR mRNA, and that cellular AUF1 can be immunoprecipitated from polysome-derived proteins following UV cross-linking to the 3′-UTR of the human β1-AR mRNA. These data link for the first time a specific mRNA-binding protein known to be associated with the regulation of mRNA stability, with the mRNA of a G-protein-coupled receptor. In addition, they demonstrate that the abundance of this mRNA-binding protein is up-regulated by adrenergic stimulation, an effect known to destabilize β-AR mRNA. Human ventricular myocardium was obtained from two categories of adult subjects. Failing hearts were obtained from patients undergoing heart transplantation for end stage heart failure (n = 20) due exclusively to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. These individuals had not received intravenous β-AR agonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or β-blocking drugs prior to transplantation. Nonfailing hearts were obtained from adult organ donors whose hearts were unsuitable for cardiac transplantation due to blood type or size incompatibility (n = 14). Organ donors' hearts had normal left ventricular function, as determined by echocardiography. Left ventricular aliquots were removed from the heart immediately upon explantation, and either immersed in liquid nitrogen for mRNA and protein quantification or placed in ice-cold, oxygenated Tyrode's solution for preparation of material for radioligand binding assays, as described previously(3.Bristow M.R. Ginsburg R. Umans V. Fowler M. Minobe W. Rasmussen R. Zera P. Menlove R. Shah P. Jamieson S. Stinson E. Circ. Res. 1986; 59: 297-309Google Scholar). DDT1-MF2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan UT), penicillin (60 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) as described previously(41.Port J.D. Huang L.-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24103-24108Google Scholar). Cells were treated with either β-AR agonist 1 μM(-)-isoproterenol, or vehicle (1 mM ascorbic acid) as described in each individual protocol. A 233-base pair fragment of p37AUF1 cDNA (31.Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar) was cloned from human heart DNA by the use of reverse transcription-PCR. Primers utilized for this reaction spanned a segment of the human p37AUF1 coding region cDNA sequence from nucleotides 471 to 702 (31.Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar) and incorporated restriction enzyme recognition sites at the 5′ ends (SmaI for the forward primer and XbaI for the reverse primer). Primer sequences were: 5′-CCCGGGAAGCTTGGGAAAATGTTTATAGGAGGCC-3′ for the forward primer, and 5′-GATCTCTAGAGCTTTGGCCCTTTTAGGATC-3′ for the reverse primer. The PCR product was subcloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA) and sequenced using the dideoxy method (Sequenase Version 2, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Radiolabeled antisense riboprobes were transcribed from the HindIII digested p37AUF1 cDNA fragment using T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN), and the Maxiscript kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Total cellular RNA from human ventricular myocardium or from DDT1-MF2 cells was extracted by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (44.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 1622: 156-159Google Scholar) using RNA Stat-60 (Tel Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX), and quantified by absorbance at A260. In each ribonuclease protection assay (RPA), 10 μg of RNA were hybridized overnight with 106 cpm of radiolabeled AUF1 riboprobe and a low specific activity 18 S rRNA riboprobe (Ambion, Inc.) using the RPA II kit (Ambion Inc.). Since 18 S rRNA abundance is in excess of mRNAs, 18 S probe was produced at a low specific activity to assure molar excess of probe to target without producing a signal beyond the linear range when measured simultaneously with AUF1. The hybridization reaction was digested with RNase A and RNase T1. RNA-RNA hybrids were resolved by electrophoresis in an 8% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel. Protected fragments corresponding to AUF1 and 18 S rRNA signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). The abundance of hamster β2-AR mRNA from DDT1-MF2 cells was measured by RPA using a specific riboprobe. All measurements were made as described above for AUF1 including normalization of the β2-AR mRNA signal to the signal for 18 S rRNA. The riboprobe (311 nucleotides) was generated from plasmid DNA encoding the hamster β2-AR using PCR primers corresponding to nucleotides 1201 to 1511 (45.Dixon R.A.F. Kobilka B.K. Strader D.J.

Nature. 1986; 321: 75-79Google Scholar) and including restriction sites for XhoI and EcoRI. The forward primer was 5′-GATCCTCGAGGATTTCAGGATTGCCTTCCA-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GATCGAATTCTAGTGTCCTGTCAGGGAGGG-3′. The PCR product, corresponding to the 3′ end of the coding region and the 5′ end of the 3′-UTR, was subcloned into pBluescript II KS, and the nucleotide sequence was verified by DNA sequence analysis. Antisense RNA probe was generated using T7 RNA polymerase from riboprobe construct linearized with XhoI as described above. Human β1-AR mRNA abundance from human ventricular myocardium was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR as described in detail previously(6.Bristow M.R. Minobe W. Raynolds M.V. Port J.D. Rasmussen R. Ray P.E. Feldman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2737-2745Google Scholar). Briefly, poly(A)+-enriched RNA was extracted from samples of human ventricular myocardium using oligo(dT)-cellulose (Micro-Fast TrackTM mRNA Isolation Kit Version 1.2, Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). mRNA was subjected to a reverse transcriptase reaction in the presence of a fixed amount of synthetic (84mer) RNA #x0201C;internal standard” such that target mRNA (β1AR) and internal standard were amplified colinearly. PCR primers were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and the absolute amounts of β1-AR and internal standard PCR products were determined for each heart by linear modeling of at least 3 points on the linear portion of the amplification curves. β-AR density from human ventricular myocardium was determined in a crude membrane fraction as described previously(3.Bristow M.R. Ginsburg R. Umans V. Fowler M. Minobe W. Rasmussen R. Zera P. Menlove R. Shah P. Jamieson S. Stinson E. Circ. Res. 1986; 59: 297-309Google Scholar). Briefly, the total population of β1- plus β2-AR was measured by the nonselective radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol with and without the use of 1 μML-propranolol to determine total and nonspecific binding, respectively. Maximum binding (Bmax) and [125I]iodocyanopindolol dissociation constant (Kd) were determined by nonlinear least-squares computer modeling of the specific binding curve. β1- and β2-AR subtype proportions were determined using the β1-AR selective ligand CGP-20712A(3.Bristow M.R. Ginsburg R. Umans V. Fowler M. Minobe W. Rasmussen R. Zera P. Menlove R. Shah P. Jamieson S. Stinson E. Circ. Res. 1986; 59: 297-309Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Peterson modification of the method of Lowry(46.Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Google Scholar). Abundance of AUF1 polypeptides was determined in extracts of DDT1-MF2 cells and in human heart tissues using a polyclonal antibody described previously(31.Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar). In human K562 cells, this antibody recognizes p37AUF1,p40AUF1 an apparent splice form of p37AUF1, and 45-kDa protein, an immunologically related but uncharacterized protein(31.Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar). DDT1-MF2 cells were either untreated or treated with 10 μM(-)-isoproterenol for 24 or 48 h. Cells were harvested with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM EDTA, centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g, and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptine). Cell lysates were subjected to eight rounds of freeze/thaw (dry ice/ethanol for 1 min, 37°C water bath for 1 min). The samples were centrifuged at 16,250 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Total protein concentrations were measured using the BCA reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of protein were resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer(47.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), boiled for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE (10% resolution phase and 5% stacking phase). Western blotting was performed as described previously(48.Hadcock J.R. Port J.D. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11915-11922Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to 0.1-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) for 2 h at 40 V. Blots were blocked overnight in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% nonfat dry milk, washed 5 × 5 min with 0.5% phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 1 h with 1:1000 anti-AUF1 antibody(31.Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar), washed again in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with 1:1000 GAR (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., Westgrave, PA). Signal was visualized using ECL detection using the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham) and Kodak X-Omat AR film. Signal intensity was determined using an Alpha Innotech IS-1000 Digital Imaging System (San Leandro, CA). Linear range of the protein signal for AUF1 was determined by comparison of increasing amounts of protein (1-25 μg) on the immunoblot. All subsequent quantification was performed using 2.5 μg of total cellular protein, a concentration at the lower end of the linear range. For human heart tissues, approximately 100 mg of tissue frozen in liquid N2 was placed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, aprotinin 10 μg/ml, and leupeptin 10 μg/ml). The tissue was homogenized using 25 strokes of a Teflon pestle and a T-liner at 4°C. The homogenate was subjected to 8 rounds of freeze/thaw and centrifuged at 16,250 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and the protein concentration determined as above. To perform Western analysis, 100 μg of total cellular protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above and transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Millipore, Marlborough MA) for 2.5 h at 40 V. Subsequent immunodetection methods were as outlined above. The ~2.4-kilobase cDNA encoding the human β1-AR (49.Frielle T. Collins S. Daniel K.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7920-7924Google Scholar) was subcloned into pBluescript II KS at the EcoRI site and its orientation confirmed by DNA sequencing. Nucleotide sequence was determined from purified, double stranded plasmid DNA by the dideoxy method (Sequenase Version 2). Sequencing primers corresponding to the published sequence of the β1-AR coding region and to the T3 primer were used initially. Internal primers were used once additional sequence had been established. TAQ-uense DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was used to sequence the T-rich portion of the cDNA. Each DNA strand was sequenced at least twice to insure accuracy. The cDNA sequence of the 3′-UTR of the human β1-AR has been submitted to GenBank (U29690). A 919-base pair cDNA fragment corresponding to the β1-AR 3′-UTR was synthesized by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) utilizing the XhoI and XbaI restriction endonuclease sites. The resulting vector was linearized with XbaI, and in vitro transcription was performed as described previously(41.Port J.D. Huang L.-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24103-24108Google Scholar). Briefly, radiolabeled RNA was synthesized using T7 DNA-directed RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, DuPont New England Nuclear) to produce uniformly labeled, 5′-capped RNA. After transcription, RNase-free DNase I was added to the mixture to remove template DNA. The labeled transcript was extracted with phenol/chloroform, then chloroform only, precipitated with ethanol and washed with 70% ethanol, resuspended in RNase-free water, and maintained at −80°C until use. A 0.3 M KCl ribosomal salt wash (RSW) was produced from DDT1-MF2 cells using the method of Brewer and Ross(50.Brewer G. Ross J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 202-209Google Scholar). The coding region of p37AUF1 resides on a 910-base pair BsmAI fragment spanning nucleotides 236 to 1146 of the cDNA(31.Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar). This fragment was blunted and inserted into the SmaI site of the pGEM7Z(+) vector (Promega) to yield the pGEM7Z/P37CR plasmid. To generate the corresponding His6-AUF1 fusion peptide expression vector, an Asp718-HindIII fragment from pGEM/P37CR was inserted into Asp718-HindIII digested pTrcHisB (Invitrogen) resulting in pTrcHisB/P37CR. The reading frame of the His6-AUF1 fusion polypeptide was confirmed by both dideoxy sequencing and reactivity of the fusion polypeptide with polyclonal AUF1 antiserum. An Escherichia coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) clone containing pTrcHisB/P37CR was induced to express plasmid-encoded protein by culturing with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (U. S. Biochemical). His6-AUF1 fusion polypeptide was purified using the Xpress System (Invitrogen) under native conditions as described by the manufacturer. Selected fractions were electrophoresed, and the protein profile assessed by Coomassie staining. Fractions 4-11 were pooled, and human α-lactalbumin (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml to aid in preserving the activity of the recombinant AUF1 protein during storage at −80°C. The concentration of purified recombinant AUF1 was determined by comparison with known amounts of bovine serum albumin using Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblot analysis using anti-AUF1 polyclonal antiserum. UV cross-linking was performed as described previously(41.Port J.D. Huang L.-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24103-24108Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of radiolabeled RNA (1-4 × 106 cpm) was added to a mixture containing 20 μl of RSW (~5 × 106 cell equivalents/μl) from DDT1-MF2 cells, 5 μg of yeast tRNA, 4 mM dithiothreitol, 5 μg heparin, and 65 units of RNasin in a total volume of 50 μl. After incubation for 10 min at 22°C, samples were placed in an ice slurry and exposed to short-wave (254 nm) UV radiation for 3 min in a Stratagene (model 1800) UV Stratalinker. The cross-linked RNA was digested with RNase A (0.5 mg/ml) and RNase T1 (10 units/ml) at 37°C for 30 min. Samples were solubilized in 50 μl of Laemmli loading buffer for 10 min at 70°C, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (Sigma) followed by destaining and drying, and subjected to autoradiography for 1-5 days. Polysomes and RSW from DDT1-MF2 cells and radiolabeled human β1-AR 3′-UTR RNA were prepared as described above. Polysomes or RSW (~2 × 106 cell equivalents) were mixed with 5 × 106 cpm of β1-AR 3′-UTR RNA, UV cross-linked, and digested with RNase A and T1 as described above. Polysomes or RSW were precleared with preimmune serum and Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and immunoprecipitated as described by Zhang et al.(31.Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in Laemmli buffer, boiled 5 min, and proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%). Gels were dried, and radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography for 2 to 5 days. In failing ventricular myocardium, β1-AR mRNA and receptor protein are significantly down-regulated to a similar extent(6.Bristow M.R. Minobe W. Raynolds M.V. Port J.D. Rasmussen R. Ray P.E.

For example, DAG is an allosteric regulator of protein kinase C, and the cellular levels of DAG may influence a variety of processes including growth and differentiation. We previously demonstrated that human endothelial cells derived from umbilical vein express growth-dependent changes in their basal levels of diacylglycerol and diacylglycerol kinase activity (Whatley, R. E., Stroud, E. D., Bunting, M., Zimmerman, G. A., McIntyre, T. M., and Prescott, S. M.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 16130-16138). To further explore the role of diacylglycerol metabolism in endothelial responses, we used a degenerate reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method to identify diacylglycerol kinase isozymes expressed by human endothelial cells. We report the isolation of a 3.5-kilobase cDNA encoding a novel diacylglycerol kinase (hDGKζ) with a predicted molecular mass of 103.9 kDa. Human DGKζ contains two zinc fingers, an ATP binding site, and four ankyrin repeats near the carboxyl terminus. A unique feature, as compared with other diacylglycerol kinases, is the presence of a sequence homologous to the MARCKS phosphorylation site domain. From Northern blot analysis of multiple tissues, we observed that hDGKζ mRNA is expressed at highest levels in brain. COS-7 cells transfected with the hDGKζ cDNA express 117-kDa and 114-kDa proteins that react specifically with an antibody to a peptide derived from a unique sequence in hDGKζ. The transfected cells also express increased diacylglycerol kinase activity, which is not altered in the presence of R59949, an inhibitor of human platelet DGK activity. The hDGKζ displays stereoselectivity for 1,2-diacylglycerol species in comparison to 1,3-diacylglycerol, but does not exhibit any specificity for molecular species of long chain diacylglycerols.

https://openalex.org/W2065235534,"The GDP-dissociation-inhibitor (GDI) for Rho-like GTP-binding proteins is capable of three different biochemical activities. These are the inhibition of GDP dissociation, the inhibition of GTP hydrolysis, and the stimulation of the release of GTP-binding proteins from membranes. In order to better understand how GDI interactions with Rho-like proteins mediate these different effects, we have set out to develop a direct fluorescence spectroscopic assay for the binding of the GDI to the Rho-like protein, Cdc42Hs. We show here that when the GDI interacts with Cdc42Hs that contains bound N-methylanthraniloyl GDP (Mant-GDP), there is an ∼20% quenching of the Mant fluorescence. The GDI-induced quenching is only observed when Mant-GDP is bound to Spodoptera frugiperda-expressed Cdc42Hs and is not detected when the Mant nucleotide is bound to Escherichia coli-expressed Cdc42Hs and thus shows the same requirement for isoprenylated GTP-binding protein as that observed when assaying GDI activity. A truncated Cdc42Hs mutant that lacks 8 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus and is insensitive to GDI regulation also does not show changes in the fluorescence of its bound Mant-GDP upon GDI addition. Thus, the GDI-induced quenching of Mant-GDP provides a direct read-out for the binding of the GDI to Cdc42Hs. Titration profiles of the GDI-induced quenching of the Mant-GDP fluorescence are saturable and are well fit to a simple 1:1 binding model for Cdc42Hs-GDI interactions with an apparent Kd value of 30 nM. A very similar Kd value (28 nM) is measured when titrating the GDI-induced quenching of the fluorescence of Mant-guanylyl imidotriphosphate, bound to Cdc42Hs. These results suggest that the GDI can bind to the GDP-bound and GTP-bound forms of Cdc42Hs equally well. We also have used the fluorescence assay for GDI interactions to demonstrate that the differences in functional potency observed between the GDI molecule and a related human leukemic protein, designated LD4, are due to differences in their binding affinities for Cdc42Hs. This, together with the results from studies using GDI/LD4 chimeras, allow us to conclude that a limit region within the carboxyl-terminal domain of the GDI molecule is responsible for its ability to bind with higher affinity (compared with LD4) to Cdc42Hs.

The Ras-like low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins form a superfamily whose members are involved in a plethora of biological pathways that include the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, vesicular transport, and cytoskeletal organization. The GTP-binding proteins appear to act as molecular switches by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. This cycle is tightly regulated by distinct proteins. In particular, the exchange of GDP to GTP is stimulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 1The abbreviations used are: GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorGAPGTPase-activating protein for low molecular mass GTP-binding proteinsGDIGDP-dissociation inhibitorGppNpguanosine 5-(β,γ-imido)triphosphateGSTglutathione S-transferaseMantN-methylanthraniloylCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. and the hydrolysis of GTP back to GDP is catalyzed by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). A third class of regulatory proteins were discovered based on their ability to inhibit GDP dissociation (and thus were originally designated as GDP-dissociation inhibitors or GDIs). The GDIs are capable of two other important biochemical activities, namely they inhibit GTP hydrolysis and promote the dissociation of GTP-binding proteins from membranes. Given these various activities, it has been speculated that the GDIs might play a critical role in mediating the movement of GTP-binding proteins between different cellular locations. guanine nucleotide exchange factor GTPase-activating protein for low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins GDP-dissociation inhibitor guanosine 5-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate glutathione S-transferase N-methylanthraniloyl 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. A major interest in our laboratory has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of regulation of the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle of the Cdc42Hs GTP-binding protein. Cdc42Hs is the human homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell division cycle protein (Cdc42Sc) (Johnson and Pringle, 13.Johnson D.I. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 143-152Google Scholar; Shinjo et al., 1990), which plays an essential role in the establishment of cell polarity by controlling the assembly of the bud site. The Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cdc42 protein is essential for both uni-directional and bi-directional cell growth (Miller and Johnson, 17.Miller P. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1075Google Scholar), and the mammalian Cdc42 protein has recently been implicated in filopodia formation (Kozma et al., 14.Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15(4): 1942-1952Google Scholar; Nobes and Hall, 20.Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Google Scholar) and in the stimulation of the nuclear kinases Jnk and p38 (Coso et al., 1995; Minden et al., 18.Minden A. Lin A. Claret F. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar; Hill et al., 11.Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Google Scholar; Bagrodia et al., 1995a). Several regulators of the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle of Cdc42Hs have now been identified. These include the Dbl oncogene product (Hart et al., 1991a), which serves as a GEF for Cdc42 in mammalian cells, and the Cdc24 gene product, which functions as a GEF for Cdc42 in S. cerevisiae (Zheng et al., 1994). In addition, a specific GAP (designated the Cdc42Hs-GAP) has been purified (Hart et al., 1991b) and cloned (Barford et al., 1993), and a Cdc42Hs-GDI activity was purified from brain cytosol and shown to be identical to the RhoGDI (Leonard et al., 10.Hart M.J. Morv Y. Leonard D. Witte O.N. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Science. 1992; 258: 812-815Google Scholar). To better understand how these different proteins regulate the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle of Cdc42Hs, we have developed real time fluorescence spectroscopic assays to monitor each step of the cycle. Initially, we used the fluorescence of the single tryptophan residue of Cdc42Hs (Trp97) as an intrinsic reporter group for monitoring GTP hydrolysis (Leonard et al., 16.Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Google Scholar). In addition, along the lines of experiments performed with Ras (Antonny et al., 2.Antonny B. Chardin P. Roux M. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8287-8295Google Scholar; Rensland et al., 1991; Moore et al., 19.Moore K.J.M. Webb M.R. Eccleston J.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7451-7459Google Scholar), we have used the fluorescence of Mant-derivatized nucleotides to monitor the kinetics of nucleotide binding and dissociation from Cdc42Hs (Leonard et al., 1994). More recently, we have covalently attached an exogenous fluorescent probe to Cdc42Hs and used the fluorescence of the probe to directly monitor the GTP-binding and GTPase activities of Cdc42Hs (Nomanbhoy et al., 1996). Although the methods discussed above have provided us with real time read-outs for the GEF-catalyzed GDP-GTP exchange and GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolytic reactions, they have not provided a means to directly monitor the binding of Cdc42Hs to its GDI (i.e. the RhoGDI). There is a great deal of interest in understanding the interactions of RhoGDI with Cdc42Hs and related proteins (i.e. Rac and RhoA) because of the multiple regulatory activities exhibited by the GDI, i.e. its ability to bind to both the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of Cdc42Hs and to elicit the release of both forms of Cdc42Hs from membranes. As a first step toward characterizing these interactions, we set out to develop a fluorescence assay that would allow us to directly monitor Cdc42Hs-RhoGDI complex formation in real time. In the present study, we describe such a read-out that takes advantage of a GDI-induced quenching of the fluorescence of Mant-nucleotides bound to Cdc42Hs. We have gone on to use this read-out to address two important questions regarding the actions of RhoGDI. The first concerns the relative ability of RhoGDI to bind to the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of Cdc42Hs. This question directly bears on the relevance of RhoGDI as a GTPase inhibitor of Cdc42Hs and on the ability of RhoGDI to cause activated (GTP-bound) forms of Cdc42Hs to be released from membranes. The second question that we have addressed relates to the mechanistic basis of the functional differences that have been observed between RhoGDI and a highly related molecule, designated LD4, in their actions toward Cdc42Hs. Specifically, it has been shown that although LD4 has GDI activity toward Cdc42Hs, it is significantly less potent than that of the RhoGDI. Recent chimera studies have demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal domains of the RhoGDI and LD4 molecules are responsible for the difference in potency (Platko et al., 1995). In the present study, we have used the fluorescence read-out for GDI interactions to determine if the functional differences between RhoGDI and LD4 directly reflect differences in their binding affinity for Cdc42Hs. If so, this then would highlight the amino acid residues on the RhoGDI molecule that are critical for high affinity binding to GTP-binding proteins. RhoGDI, RhoGDIΔ8, LD4, and Chimeras B, C, and D were purified as GST fusion proteins from Escherichia coli. The cloning and expression of these proteins have been described (Platko et al., 1995). Briefly, a 5-ml overnight culture of E. coli containing the appropriate expression plasmid was used to seed 1 liter of superbroth (0.032 mg/ml bactotryptone, 0.02 mg/ml yeast extract, 0.005 mg/ml NaCl, pH 7.4). This was grown in a standard shaker at 37°C. Protein expression was induced at an A560 nm of ∼0.6 with 200 μM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside for 60 min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Pellets were thawed into Buffer A (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) to which was added 1 mg/ml lysozyme. When lysis was complete, DNase was added to 0.05 mg/ml, and MgCl2 was adjusted to 2 mM. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) (∼300 μl agarose/15 ml lysate) for 15 min at 4°C. The beads were washed extensively with Buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl), and the GST fusion protein eluted with Buffer B supplemented with 10 mM glutathione. The concentration of protein was determined using the Bradford assay (Bradford, 1976). Cdc42Hs was expressed as a GST fusion protein in S. frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells by infecting the cells with the appropriate recombinant baculovirus. Generally, infection was carried out for 72 h, after which cells were harvested by centrifugation. Isoprenylated Cdc42Hs was purified by phase extraction with Triton-X 114. Cell pellets were lysed into 1 × TBS, 10% Triton-X 114, 200 μM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. The lysate was homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer and spun at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C in a microfuge. The supernatant from this spin was collected, warmed to 37°C for 2 min, and spun at 12,000 rpm for 2 min in a microfuge at room temperature. The lower detergent phase containing isoprenylated GST-Cdc42Hs was pooled and diluted into 1 × TBS so that the final detergent concentration was 1%. This was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) (∼300 μl of agarose/10 ml of lysate) for 25 min at 4°C. The beads were washed extensively with Buffer B containing 0.1% CHAPS. GST-Cdc42Hs was then eluted from the column using Buffer C (50 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mM glutathione). 8 μl of a 1 unit/μl thrombin solution (Sigma) were added to the eluate, and thrombin digestion was carried out for 90 min at room temperature. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay, and the percentage of isoprenylated Cdc42Hs in each preparation was estimated by performing a GDI assay using radiolabeled nucleotides (Leonard et al., 15.Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Google Scholar). The value generally ranged from 40 to 60%. Mant-GDP and Mant-GppNp were synthesized from the parent nucleotides and N-methylisatoic acid according to the published procedure (Hiratsuka, 12.Hiratsuka T. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Google Scholar). Isoprenylated GST-Cdc42Hs, prepared as described above, was bound to glutathione-agarose beads. This was incubated in 10 mM EDTA and 20 μM Mant-GDP or Mant-GppNp for 20 min at room temperature. MgCl2 was then added to 20 mM to block the further exchange of Mant-nucleotide onto GST-Cdc42Hs. The beads were washed with Buffer B containing 0.1% CHAPS and 5 mM MgCl2 to remove free Mant-nucleotide. GST-Cdc42Hs labeled with Mant nucleotide was eluted from the column using glutathione, and then Cdc42Hs was released from GST through thrombin digestion, as described above. The fluorescence measurements were made using an SLM 8000c spectrofluorometer operated in the photon-counting mode. Samples were stirred continuously and thermostated at 30°C in Buffer D (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2). The Kd values for the binding of RhoGDI, LD4, and GDI/LD4 chimeras to Cdc42Hs-Mant-GDP, and RhoGDI to Cdc42Hs-Mant-GppNp were obtained using the following equation: F=F1+Ff[((Kd+LT+RT)−((Kd+LT+RT)2−4TTLT)1/2)2RT](Eq. 1) where F is the change in fluorescence over initial fluorescence (-ΔF/Fo), Fi is the initial value for (-ΔF/Fo), Ff is the final value of (-ΔF/Fo), LT is the total concentration of RhoGDI, LD4, or the chimeras, and RT is the total concentration of Cdc42Hs-Mant-GDP or Cdc42Hs-Mant-GppNp. Fits were generated using IgorPro wavemetrics software. A primary aim of these studies was to develop a fluorescence read-out that would enable us to directly monitor the interactions of RhoGDI with Cdc42Hs in real time. Because one of the key activities of the GDI is to block the dissociation of guanine nucleotide from the GTP-binding protein, we examined whether RhoGDI binding to Cdc42Hs influenced the microenvironment of the nucleotide binding site, as might be reflected by a change in the fluorescence of Mant nucleotides. The results presented in Fig. 1A show that this is in fact the case. Specifically, the addition of RhoGDI to the Cdc42Hs-Mant-GDP complex results in a ∼20% decrease in Mant fluorescence. It should be noted that the emission maxima for both spectra (i.e. in the presence and the absence of added RhoGDI) are about the same (∼445 nm). This indicates that the conformational change in the vicinity of the Mant moiety does not involve a significant change in the hydrophobicity of the environment surrounding the nucleotide, as might be expected if the fluorescence change were an outcome of the GDI molecule directly covering the nucleotide site. Rather, these results suggest that RhoGDI binding to Cdc42Hs induces a conformational change that brings a “quenching residue” into the vicinity of the Mant moiety. As shown in Fig. 1B, the interaction between RhoGDI and Cdc42Hs that gives rise to the quenching of Mant-GDP fluorescence is rapid and occurs within the time period of mixing (<5 s). The RhoGDI-induced decrease in Mant-GDP fluorescence is also specific for isoprenylated Cdc42Hs, consistent with earlier suggestions that the geranyl-geranylation of Rho-subtype GTP-binding proteins is necessary for their interactions with GDI (Ueda et al., 1990). No quenching of the Mant-GDP fluorescence was observed when RhoGDI was added to Cdc42Hs that was expressed and purified from E. coli (Fig. 1B) or when added to Cdc42Hs that was expressed in Sf9 cells but purified from the aqueous fraction of the Triton-X 114 phase extraction (data not shown). There were a number of other criteria that would be expected to be met if the RhoGDI-induced quenching of the Mant fluorescence reflected a direct interaction between GDI and Cdc42Hs. For example, it would be expected that the addition of isoprenylated (Sf9-expressed) Cdc42Hs that contained GDP (rather than the fluorescent Mant-GDP) would compete with the Cdc42Hs-Mant-GDP complex and thus block the RhoGDI-induced change in Mant fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 2A, the inclusion of excess isoprenylated GDP-bound Cdc42Hs (250 nMversus 15 nM Mant-GDP-bound Cdc42Hs) prior to the addition of RhoGDI completely inhibited the GDI-dependent quenching of the Mant fluorescence. This inhibition was specific for isoprenylated Cdc42Hs, because the addition of nonisoprenylated (E. coli-expressed) Cdc42Hs to 450 nM only slightly attenuated the quenching of Mant fluorescence by RhoGDI (Fig. 2B). In addition, when RhoGDI was first added to the Cdc42Hs-Mant-GDP complex, in order to effect a quenching of the Mant fluorescence, it was possible to rapidly reverse the GDI-induced quenching by subsequently adding an excess of isoprenylated GDP-bound Cdc42Hs (Fig. 2C). Finally, in a previous study, we characterized a RhoGDI truncation mutant in which 8 amino acids had been removed from the carboxyl terminus (RhoGDIΔ8). Specifically, we observed that RhoGDIΔ8 showed absolutely no GDI activity toward Cdc42Hs (Platko et al., 1995). This indicated that the carboxyl-terminal domain of RhoGDI contains residues that are critical for the interaction between RhoGDI and Cdc42Hs, either through a direct involvement in binding Cdc42Hs or through the maintenance of an appropriate tertiary structure. We would therefore predict that due to its inability to bind to Cdc42Hs, RhoGDIΔ8 would not induce a quenching of the Mant fluorescence of Cdc42Hs-Mant-GDP. Fig. 3 shows that this turned out to be the case, that is the addition of RhoGDIΔ8 to isoprenylated Cdc42Hs-Mant-GDP did not cause a significant decrease in Mant fluorescence. Thus, taken together, our observations in Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3: indicate that the quenching of the Mant fluorescence by RhoGDI is a direct reflection of the binding of GDI to Cdc42Hs. Having established a direct fluorescence assay for the binding of RhoGDI to Cdc42Hs, we then used this read-out to determine the affinity of the GDI molecule for the Mant-GDP-bound form of Cdc42Hs. Fig. 4A shows the results of an experiment where the level of the Cdc42Hs-Mant-GDP complex was kept constant and increasing amounts of the RhoGDI were added to the fluorescence cuvette while continuously monitoring the emission of Mant fluorescence at 440 nm. The raw data show that the RhoGDI-induced quenching is a saturable response. Fig. 4B shows the resultant titration profile obtained from the data; the titration data can be fit well to a simple binding model (solid line) that assumes a single class of binding sites for the RhoGDI/Cdc42Hs-Mant-GDP interaction with a Kd value of 30 nM. We have shown that RhoGDI is able to interact with the GTP-bound form of Cdc42Hs and inhibits both its intrinsic GTPase activity, as well as the GAP-stimulated activity (Hart et al., 1992). This finding was surprising because the RhoGDI was first reported to bind specifically to the GDP-bound form of Rho (Ueda et al., 1990) and because it has been well documented that the RabGDI only interacts with Rab GTP-binding proteins when they are in the GDP-bound state (Sasaki et al., 1990). Thus, an important question concerns the affinity of the RhoGDI for GTP-bound Cdc42Hs and how that compares with its affinity for the GDP-bound form of Cdc42Hs. Given that we have found that Mant-GppNp fully mimics GTP or GTP-analogs (e.g. GTPγS, GppNp) in its ability to induce activating conformational changes in Cdc42Hs (as assessed by changes in tryptophan fluorescence and binding to the putative target mPAK-3 (Bagrodia et al., 1995b; Leonard et al., 1994); data not shown), we have taken advantage of the GDI-induced changes in Mant fluorescence to directly examine the interactions of the GDI with the activated (Mant-GppNp-bound) form of Cdc42Hs. The results presented in Fig. 5A show the changes that occur in the fluorescence of Mant-GppNp (bound to Cdc42Hs) upon the addition of increasing amounts of RhoGDI. The resultant titration profile is presented in Fig. 5B and shows that the data can be fit well to a model assuming a single class of binding sites for the interaction between Mant-GppNp-Cdc42Hs and the GDI. The calculated Kd value for the interaction is 28 nM, which is virtually identical to that for the interaction between RhoGDI and Mant-GDP-bound Cdc42Hs. Thus, these results indicate that the RhoGDI binds equally well to both nucleotide states of Cdc42Hs. We have characterized the hematopoeitic cell homolog for GDI, LD4, and observed that despite having significant sequence similarity to RhoGDI (∼67% identity), the activity of LD4 toward Cdc42Hs is about 10-20-fold weaker than that of RhoGDI (Adra et al., 1.Adra C.N. Ko J. Leonard D. Wirth L.J. Cerione R.A. Lim B. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1993; 8: 253-261Google Scholar; Platko et al., 1995). One possibility for this difference is that the LD4 protein binds to Cdc42Hs with a much weaker affinity than does the RhoGDI. If this is the case, it would have important implications regarding the site on RhoGDI that is responsible for conferring high affinity binding to Cdc42Hs, because we recently have mapped the site on RhoGDI that is responsible for its enhanced functional potency (relative to LD4) to a region within the carboxyl-terminal domain of the molecule (see below; see also Platko et al.(1995)). We therefore measured the binding of the recombinant LD4 molecule to Cdc42Hs using the direct fluorescence read-out. The addition of LD4 to Mant-GDP-bound Cdc42Hs resulted in a quenching of the Mant-GDP fluorescence, just as was the case with RhoGDI. However, as shown in Fig. 6(squares), LD4 binds to the Cdc42Hs-Mant-GDP complex with a significantly weaker affinity, yielding a Kd value of about 440 nM (which is approximately 15-fold weaker than the binding of GDI to Cdc42Hs). In a previous study (Platko et al., 1995), we had constructed a number of chimeras between RhoGDI and LD4 in order to delineate a limit region on the RhoGDI molecule that was responsible for its higher potency (relative to LD4) toward Cdc42Hs. We found that a chimera that contained the first 168 amino acids of LD4 and just the last 33 amino acids from RhoGDI (designated Chimera B) was fully active as a GDI toward Cdc42 (i.e. it behaved like wild type RhoGDI in functional assays). A chimera that contained the first 171 amino acids from RhoGDI, as well as residues 172-180 (from the carboxyl-terminal 33 residues), and the last 24 residues from LD4 (designated Chimera C) also was fully active toward Cdc42Hs, whereas a chimera that contained the first 171 amino acids from RhoGDI, followed by 8 amino acids from LD4, and then the final 25 amino acids from RhoGDI (designated as Chimera D) behaved like wild type LD4. Fig. 6 shows an analysis of the binding of Chimeras B (triangles), C (diamonds), and D (inverted triangles) to Cdc42Hs-Mant-GDP. The binding profiles obtained with these chimeras exactly corresponded to the results obtained in functional assays (Platko et al., 1995). From the best fits to the binding data, we determined Kd values of 20 nM for Chimera B, 23 nM for Chimera C, and 380 nM for Chimera D. These results strongly argue that the differences in functional potency between RhoGDI and LD4 toward Cdc42Hs are a direct outcome of the different binding affinities of these regulatory proteins. A long term goal of our laboratory has been to develop fluorescence spectroscopic read-outs to aid in the biochemical characterization of different proteins that regulate the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle of Cdc42Hs. An important aim was to develop such a read-out for the RhoGDI molecule, because it is capable of a number of interesting regulatory activities and because we already had obtained a good deal of structure-function information from chimera studies of the GDI and a related molecule, LD4 (Platko et al., 1995). In the present work, we describe a real time spectroscopic read-out for RhoGDI interactions with Cdc42Hs bound to the fluorescent nucleotide, Mant-GDP. We show that as an outcome of RhoGDI binding, a significant quenching (∼20%) of the Mant-GDP fluorescence occurs. The RhoGDI-induced quenching shows all the characteristics expected for a proper interaction between this regulator and the GTP-binding protein, namely that it is specific for the isoprenylated form of Cdc42Hs and is not detected when using a carboxyl-terminal truncated mutant of the GDI, which was previously shown to be incapable of binding. Using this fluorescence assay, one of the important questions that we set out to address was how the binding of the RhoGDI to the GTP-bound (activated) form of Cdc42Hs compared with its binding to the GDP-bound (inactive) form. We found that these interactions occur with virtually identical affinities, thus suggesting that the ability of the RhoGDI to bind to the Cdc42Hs-GTP species and inhibit the GTPase activity may be as important (in terms of biological regulation) as the previously recognized binding of this regulator to the Cdc42Hs-GDP complex. One possibility is that the RhoGDI interaction is essential for “shuttling” Cdc42Hs between different membrane locations within the cell. We recently have demonstrated that a predominant location of the GDP-bound form of Cdc42Hs is the Golgi 2J. W. Erickson, C. Zhang, R. A. Kahn, T. Evans, and R. A. Cerione, submitted for publication. and that this location is influenced by the Arf GTP-binding protein, which has been implicated in intracellular trafficking. These findings, together with the biological effects that Cdc42Hs mediates at the plasma membrane (filopodia formation) (Nobes and Hall, 1995; Kozma et al., 1995), suggest that the GTP-binding protein may need to cycle between these different membrane locations. Thus, the ability of the RhoGDI to bind equally well to both the GDP-bound and GTP-bound forms of Cdc42Hs, coupled with its ability to release Cdc42Hs from membranes (Leonard et al., 1992), may enable this regulatory protein to facilitate the movement of the appropriate nucleotide-bound form of Cdc42Hs to the proper membrane target site. However, it also is possible that as yet unidentified cellular proteins influence the interactions between Cdc42Hs and the RhoGDI and either enhance or inhibit its ability to bind to specific nucleotide states of Cdc42Hs. We have found that we can also use this fluorescence assay to directly monitor the binding of the human leukemia protein, LD4, to Cdc42Hs. The LD4 protein shows a relatively high degree of sequence identity to RhoGDI, with the sequence homology extending throughout the entire length of these molecules. Interestingly, however, we have shown that LD4 is much less effective as a GDI toward Cdc42Hs, being 10-20-fold less potent. These differences were first narrowed down to the carboxyl-terminal 33 amino acid residues of the two molecules, based on studies using GDI/LD4 chimeras to assay GDI activity toward Cdc42Hs (Platko et al., 1995). It was then shown that these differences could be attributed to as few as six amino acid differences that existed between residues 172-180 of RhoGDI and the corresponding residues 169-178 of LD4. Moreover, a single amino acid change at residue 174 of LD4 to the corresponding residue of RhoGDI could impart nearly full GDI activity to the LD4 molecule. Our present fluorescence studies now show that the differences in functional potency between the RhoGDI and LD4 can be entirely attributed to differences in their abilities to bind to Cdc42Hs. This then argues that residues 172-180 of the RhoGDI molecule are responsible for the ability of this regulatory protein to bind with high affinity to the GTP-binding protein. Because two of these residues are conserved in LD4, these results argue that as few as six amino acids are responsible for the significantly higher affinity of RhoGDI (compared with LD4) for Cdc42Hs. At present, we still do not know the identity of all of the amino acid residues on the GDI molecule and Cdc42Hs that are critical for the binding interaction between these proteins. However, we intend to use this read-out to screen a variety of mutants of GDI and the GTP-binding protein to gain a more complete picture of the contact sites that are involved. We also hope to use this read-out in conjunction with fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements in membrane preparations to address the molecular mechanism that underlies the GDI-stimulated release of Cdc42Hs from phospholipid bilayers.

However, some receptors activate PI 3-kinase without causing GLUT4 translocation, suggesting specific cellular localization may be critical to this PI 3-kinase function. Consistent with this idea, complexes containing PI 3-kinase bound to insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes are associated with intracellular membranes (Heller-Harrison, R., Morin, M. and Czech, M. (4.Czech M.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 441-471Google Scholar) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 24442-24450). We report here that in response to insulin, activated complexes of IRS-1•PI 3-kinase can be immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibody from detergent extracts of immunoadsorbed GLUT4-containing vesicles prepared from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The targeting of PI 3-kinase to rat adipocyte GLUT4-containing vesicles using vesicles prepared by sucrose velocity gradient ultracentrifugation was also demonstrated. Insulin treatment caused a 2.3-fold increase in immunoreactive p85 protein in these GLUT4-containing vesicles while anti-p85 immunoprecipitates of PI 3-kinase activity in GLUT4-containing vesicle extracts increased to a similar extent. HPLC analysis of the GLUT4 vesicle-associated PI 3-kinase activity showed insulin-mediated increases in PI 3-P, PI 3,4-P2, and PI 3,4,5-P3 when PI, PI 4-P, and PI 4,5-P2 were used as substrates. Our data demonstrate that insulin directs the association of PI 3-kinase with GLUT4-containing vesicles in 3T3-L1 and rat adipocytes, consistent with the hypothesis that PI 3-kinase is involved in the insulin-regulated movement of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane.

INTRODUCTIONOne of the major physiological effects of insulin is its ability to stimulate glucose uptake in adipose tissue and muscle(1.Cushman S. Wardzala L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Google Scholar, 2.Suzuki K. Kono T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Google Scholar). The acute stimulation of glucose transport rates in response to insulin is associated with the rapid translocation of GLUT4 transporters to the cell surface from an intracellular location, most likely within the tubulovesicular endosomal membrane system (for reviews see Refs. 3 and 4). Rapid appearance of GLUT4 on the cell surface in response to insulin has been well documented utilizing a variety of techniques including biochemical cell fractionation(1.Cushman S. Wardzala L. J.

However, it is still not known how early events initiated by insulin binding to its cell surface receptor lead to increased glucose uptake.One early step in the insulin signaling pathway is the activation of PI 3-kinase 1The abbreviations used are: PIphosphatidylinositolIRS-1insulin receptor substrate 1SHSrc homologyBCAbicinchoninic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. secondary to the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on tyrosine residues (for reviews see (13.Keller S.

Phosphotyrosine residues specifically found within multiple YXXM motifs on IRS-1 have been demonstrated to bind Src homology 2 (SH2) domains present on the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase following insulin stimulation(17.Backer J. Myers M. Shoelson S. Chin D. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu. P. Margolis B. Skolnik E. Schlessinger J. White M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Google Scholar, 18.Yonezawa K. Ueda H. Hara K. Nishida K.

The binding of p85 to IRS-1 activates the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase which catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphoinositides at the D3 position of the inositol ring(17.Backer J. Myers M. Shoelson S. Chin D. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu. P. Margolis B. Skolnik E. Schlessinger J. White M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Google Scholar, 20.Kapeller R. Cantley L. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Google Scholar). A key role for 3′-phosphoinositides in membrane trafficking is suggested by studies on yeast PI 3-kinase, denoted VPS34, which is required for the proper delivery of soluble hydrolases to the yeast vacuole(21.Schu P. Takegawa K. Fry M. Stack J. Waterfield M. Emr S. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Google Scholar). Similarly, mutant platelet-derived growth factor and colony stimulating factor receptors lacking binding sites for PI 3-kinase are defective in their sorting to a degradative pathway(22.Carlberg K. Tapley P. Haystead C. Rohrschneider L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 877-883Google Scholar, 23.Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Google Scholar). That PI 3-kinase may also participate in insulin-dependent membrane trafficking of GLUT4 is suggested by the demonstration that inhibitors of PI 3-kinase activity abolish insulin-mediated translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in both 3T3-L1 and rat adipocytes(24.Cheatham B. Vlahos C. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Google Scholar, 25.Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Google Scholar). However, activation of PI 3-kinase by insulin cannot fully account for the effects of the enzyme on glucose transport since other receptor signaling systems activate PI 3-kinase activity to the same extent without causing translocation of GLUT4(26.Isakoff S. Taha C. Rose E. Marcusohn J. Klip A. Skolnik E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10247-10251Google Scholar). A critical aspect of this function of PI 3-kinase may therefore be its directed localization to the specialized intracellular membranes that sequester GLUT4.The above considerations have led us to hypothesize that insulin receptor activation causes the rapid delivery of IRS-1•PI 3-kinase complexes to intracellular GLUT4-enriched membranes where 3′-phosphoinositides may accumulate and function in the membrane-associated events which accompany the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface. The high concentration of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 present in intracellular low density microsomes (27.Kelly K. Ruderman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Google Scholar, 28.Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Google Scholar) and our recent finding that membrane association of IRS-1 can be regulated by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (29.Heller-Harrison R. Morin M. Czech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Google Scholar) reinforce this hypothesis. Two separate studies have reported that GLUT4-containing vesicles prepared from rat adipocytes do not contain PI 3-kinase, IRS-1, or insulin receptors(27.Kelly K. Ruderman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Google Scholar, 30.DelVecchio R. Pilch P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13278-13283Google Scholar). However, the insulin stimulations in these studies were for 10 min or longer. In the present studies, we tested the possibility that rapid association of activated IRS-1•PI 3-kinase complexes with the GLUT4-containing vesicles might occur. Our data demonstrate that insulin-activated PI 3-kinase indeed specifically associates with GLUT4-containing vesicles of both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and rat adipocytes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PI 3-kinase and its reaction products play a functional role in the movement of intracellular GLUT4 to the cell surface in response to insulin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRabbit anti-p85 PI 3-kinase for both immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation was purchased from UBI and was used according to manufacturer's specifications.

Cells were then stimulated with the indicated concentrations of insulin for the indicated times. The insulin containing medium was aspirated, and cell monolayers were washed once with warm Buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 255 mM sucrose, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM NaF, 100 μM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaPPi, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell fractions were prepared using previously described methods(31.Clancy B. Harrison S. Buxton J. Czech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10122-10130Google Scholar). The final plasma membrane pellet was resuspended in ice cold Buffer A to a concentration of approximately 1-2 mg/ml. The final low density microsome pellet was resuspended in Buffer B (50 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM NaF, 100 μM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaPPi, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) to a concentration of approximately 1-2 mg/ml. Protein was quantitated using the BCA protein determination kit with bovine serum albumin as standard.Immunoadsorption of Glucose Transporter VesiclesVesicles carrying GLUT4 were specifically adsorbed from the low density microsomes using an IgG fraction prepared from rabbit polyclonal antiserum generated against a COOH-terminal peptide of GLUT4(31.Clancy B. Harrison S. Buxton J. Czech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10122-10130Google Scholar). 100-200 μg of low density microsomes were precleared with 20 μl of packed Protein A-Sepharose in Buffer B for 12 h. Samples were centrifuged for 3 s at 16,000 × g, and supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Anti-GLUT4 IgG was incubated with 20 μl of packed Protein A-Sepharose for 12 h, the beads were washed with Buffer B, and the antibody-bound beads were then added to the precleared low density microsomes and allowed to incubate for 24 h. Samples were centrifuged for 3 s at 16,000 × g, the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and the immunoadsorbed vesicles were washed several times with Buffer B. Immunoadsorbed vesicles were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and immunoblotting.In experiments designed to demonstrate the specificity of the immunoadsorption of GLUT4-containing vesicles (Fig. 2), 1 mM GLUT4 COOH-terminal peptide was included in Buffer B during the incubation of anti-GLUT4 IgG with Protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed with Buffer B, and then antibody-bound beads in Buffer B containing 1 mM peptide were added to the precleared low density microsomes and allowed to incubate for 24 h. The supernatants were collected and subjected to immunoblot analysis. The beads were washed in Buffer B, and immunoadsorbed vesicles were solubilized in Buffer B containing 1% Nonidet P-40. The detergent-solubilized vesicles were then immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 and subjected to a PI 3-kinase assay as described (32.Ruderman N. Kapeller R. White M. Cantley L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Google Scholar) using exogenous PI as substrate followed by thin layer chromatography (33.Walsh J. Caldwell K. Majerus P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9184-9187Google Scholar).Preparation of GLUT4-enriched Vesicles by Sucrose Velocity Gradient CentrifugationGLUT4-enriched vesicles were prepared from rat adipocyte low density microsomes utilizing the sedimentation velocity gradient centrifugation method exactly as described(34.Kandror K. Coderre L. Pushkin A. Pilch P. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 383-390Google Scholar). The resultant vesicles were either subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-p85 PI 3-kinase or were solubilized in Buffer B containing 1% Nonidet P-40, immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 PI 3-kinase, and subjected to a PI 3-kinase assay as described above.Direct Measurement of PI 3-Kinase Activity in GLUT4-containing VesiclesGLUT4-containing vesicles (15 μg) prepared as described above were resuspended in 50 μl of assay buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, PI, PI 4-P, PI 4,5-P2 (2 μg of each), [γ-32P]ATP (90 μCi at a final concentration of 5 μM), and 150 μM adenosine. The reaction was carried out for 10 min at room temperature, quenched by the addition of 150 μl of 1 M HCl followed by 300 μl of methanol:chloroform (1:1). The organic phase containing radiolabeled phospholipids was washed twice with a equal volume of methanol:1 M HCl (1:1). 32P-Phospholipids were deacylated and identified by HPLC as described(35.Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Google Scholar). 0.5-ml fractions were collected and counted in a scintillation counter. The retention times were compared with those of deacylated [32P]PI 3-P, [32P]PI 3,4-P2, and [32P]PI 3,4,5-P3 produced by using immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase. Deacylated [3H]PI 4-P and [3H]PI 4,5-P2 were also used as standards. In addition, each sample was spiked with unlabeled AMP, ADP, ATP, and GTP, and their elution was monitored with a UV absorbance detector to assess column performance.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with insulin for times ranging from 1-15 min. Immunoblot analysis of low density microsome fractions and plasma membrane fractions prepared from these cells using anti-GLUT4 (Fig. 1A) demonstrates that GLUT4 decreases in the low density microsome fraction and increases in the plasma membrane fraction in a time-dependent manner, as previously published(36.James D. Strube M. Mueckler M. Nature. 1989; 338: 83-87Google Scholar). A slight increase in GLUT4 (~30%) can be consistently detected in the plasma membrane fraction as early as 1 min, and further increases are observed at later time points, as also reported for rat adipocytes(28.Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Google Scholar).Figure 1:Immunoadsorption of GLUT4-containing vesicles from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Low density microsome (LDM) and plasma membrane (PM) fractions were prepared from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with 100 nM insulin for the times indicated. A, protein (25 μg) from each fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and was electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose for 2 h at 200 mA. The filter was blocked and subsequently incubated with anti-GLUT4 followed by 125I-Protein A. The band corresponding to GLUT4 is designated with an arrowhead. B, low density microsomes were prepared from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with 100 nM insulin for the times indicated. 125 μg of total protein were then incubated in the presence of anti-GLUT4 IgG or nonimmune rabbit IgG bound to Protein A-Sepharose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoadsorbed vesicles were reduced and alkylated prior to solubilization in sample buffer and resolution by SDS-PAGE and were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-GLUT4 followed by 125I-Protein A as detailed above. The band corresponding to GLUT4 is designated with an arrowhead.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)GLUT4-containing vesicles were prepared from basal and insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes by immunoadsorption from the low density microsome fraction using anti-GLUT4 IgG. Results presented in Fig. 1B demonstrate that this method of preparing GLUT4-containing vesicles is highly specific in that no detectable GLUT4 protein is observed in the immunoprecipitates when nonimmune IgG is utilized to immunoadsorb vesicles instead of anti-GLUT4 IgG. GLUT4 protein is recovered in the supernatants from the nonimmune IgG immunoadsorption reactions while there is little detectable GLUT4 protein in the anti-GLUT4 supernatants (data not shown). Approximately 85% of the GLUT4-containing vesicles are immunoadsorbed with our anti-GLUT4 IgG following the initial clearing of low density microsomes with Protein A-Sepharose alone. Also shown in Fig. 1B is the decrease in GLUT4-containing vesicles in the low density microsome fractions with prolonged exposure to insulin.In order to determine whether activated complexes of IRS-1•PI 3-kinase are associated with GLUT4-containing vesicles, anti-GLUT4 immunoadsorbed vesicles were solubilized in detergent-containing buffer, immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 IgG, and the anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates were subjected to a PI 3-kinase assay. Fig. 2(A, lanes 1 and 3) shows that relative to basal conditions, increased PI 3-kinase activity is co-immunoprecipitated with IRS-1 from GLUT4-containing vesicles upon a 3.5-min insulin stimulation. We also tested whether the association of IRS-1•PI 3-kinase complexes with the GLUT4-containing vesicles was specific by including a GLUT4 COOH-terminal peptide which specifically binds the anti-GLUT4 IgG during the vesicle immunoadsorption incubation. As shown in Fig. 2(A, lanes 2 and 4), the presence of GLUT4 peptide during immunoadsorption of GLUT4-containing vesicles significantly inhibited IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity. The average values from three independent experiments showed the PI 3-kinase activity associated with GLUT4 vesicles increased 630% relative to basal activity, and this increased activity was diminished to 233% in the presence of GLUT4 peptide (Fig. 2B). In all three experiments, the insulin effect on PI 3-kinase activity was 2.2-fold or greater relative to basal activity. In order to confirm the effectiveness of this peptide in blocking immunoadsorption of GLUT4-containing vesicles, equal amounts of the supernatants from the immunoadsorption of the low density microsome fractions with anti-GLUT4 IgG in the absence or presence of COOH-terminal peptide were immunoblotted for GLUT4. Fig. 2C shows that GLUT4 peptide significantly inhibits immunoadsorption of the GLUT4-containing vesicles by the anti-GLUT4 IgG. The peptide-mediated decreases in PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 2B) and immunoadsorption of GLUT4-containing vesicles as measured by densitometric scanning of the GLUT4 protein bands (Fig. 2C) were 63% and 68%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the association of IRS-1•PI 3-kinase complexes with GLUT4-containing vesicles is highly specific.We next tested whether an insulin-mediated stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity also occurs in GLUT4-containing vesicles from rat adipocytes. GLUT4-containing vesicles from freshly isolated rat adipocytes were prepared by fractionating low density microsomes in a sucrose velocity gradient, a procedure recently published for the purification of GLUT4-containing vesicles(34.Kandror K. Coderre L. Pushkin A. Pilch P. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 383-390Google Scholar, 37.Herman G. Bonzelius F. Cieutat A. Kelly R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12750-12754Google Scholar). As observed by Kandror et al.(34.Kandror K. Coderre L. Pushkin A. Pilch P. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 383-390Google Scholar) and as depicted in Fig. 3, GLUT4-containing vesicles from rat adipocytes show a distinct sedimentation distribution and sediment faster than most structures present in the low density microsome fraction. Insulin treatment of rat adipocytes (3.5 min) caused a demonstrable reduction in the amount of GLUT4-containing vesicles in the low density microsome fraction, presumably due to their translocation and fusion with the plasma membrane, as well as a reproducible shift (see inset of Fig. 3) in the sedimentation of GLUT4-containing vesicles when compared with vesicles from control cells.Figure 3:GLUT4-containing vesicles isolated from rat adipocytes by sucrose velocity gradient ultracentrifugation. Low density microsome fraction (1.5 mg of protein) from basal and insulin-treated (3.5 min) rat adipocytes were centrifuged in a 28-ml 10-35% sucrose gradient as described(34.Kandror K. Coderre L. Pushkin A. Pilch P. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 383-390Google Scholar). Inset shows immunoblot analysis of fractions using anti-GLUT4 followed by horseradish peroxidase-anti-rabbit. Graph shows the overall distribution of GLUT4 in basal (closed triangles) and insulin-treated adipocytes (open triangles) and total protein for basal adipocytes (closed circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As shown in panel A of Fig. 4, insulin treatment (3.5 min) caused a 1.6-fold increase in immunoreactive p85 protein in the low density microsome fraction while a 2.3-fold increase in the level of p85 was observed in the GLUT4-containing vesicles. PI 3-kinase activities measured in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates of the low density microsome fraction and GLUT4-containing vesicles were increased to corresponding levels (Fig. 4B). However, only a fraction of the total PI 3-kinase activity present in the low density microsome fraction was in the GLUT4-containing vesicle preparation since equal amounts of protein were used in the assays (Fig. 4B). The PI 3-kinase activity associated with both the low density microsome fraction and the GLUT4-containing vesicles was abolished by 100 nM wortmannin (data not shown). Similar results were obtained by preparing GLUT4-containing vesicles from basal and insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes using the sucrose velocity gradient procedure. A 4.8-fold increase in anti-p85 immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase activity was observed in the GLUT4-containing vesicles from insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes when compared with vesicles from control cells (data not shown).Figure 4:Insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase associates with GLUT4-containing vesicles from rat adipocytes. GLUT4-containing vesicles were prepared from unstimulated or insulin-stimulated (3.5 min) rat adipocytes by sucrose velocity gradient ultracentrifugation. A, protein (25 μg) from each preparation was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel and was electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose for 8 h at 150 mA. The filter was blocked, incubated with anti-p85 PI 3-kinase and then horseradish peroxidase-anti-rabbit followed by detection by chemiluminescence. Bands corresponding to p85 were quantitated using a scanning densitometer. B, GLUT4-containing vesicles (25 μg) were solubilized, immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 PI 3-kinase, and the immunoprecipitates were then subjected to PI 3-kinase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Spots corresponding to PI 3-P on the thin layer plate were quantitated using a Betascope. The data presented for A and B are the average values from three independent experiments ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)GLUT4-containing vesicles prepared from control and insulin-stimulated rat adipocytes were also assayed directly for PI 3-kinase activity using PI, PI 4-P, and PI 4,5-P2 as substrates (Fig. 5). The HPLC profiles of the deacylated polyphosphoinositides from the assay reaction demonstrate insulin-stimulated increases of approximately 6-fold, 3-fold, and 3.3-fold in PI 3-P, PI 3,4-P2, and PI 3,4,5-P3, respectively (Fig. 5C). The presence of 100 nM wortmannin in the assay completely abolished the insulin-stimulated increases in polyphosphoinositides associated with the GLUT4-containing vesicles (Fig. 5B). Large amounts of PI 4-P, which were not stimulated by insulin treatment, were also generated confirming PI 4-kinase is present in the GLUT4-containing vesicles(30.DelVecchio R. Pilch P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13278-13283Google Scholar). In addition, when GLUT4-containing vesicles prepared by the sucrose velocity gradient procedure were immunoadsorbed with anti-GLUT4 and then assayed for PI 3-kinase activity, HPLC analysis demonstrated a 2-fold increase in insulin-stimulated PI 3-P (data not shown).Figure 5:Effect of insulin on PI 3-kinase activity in GLUT4-containing vesicles. A, GLUT4-containing vesicles prepared from control (solid line) and insulin-treated rat adipocytes (dotted line) were assayed for PI 3-kinase activity by incubating the vesicles with PI, PI 4-P, and PI 4,5-P2 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Shown are the HPLC profiles of 32P-labeled deacylated polyphosphoinositides (gPIs). B, same as above but assay was performed in the presence of 100 nM wortmannin. C, graph shows the effect of insulin on PI 3-P, PI 3,4-P2, and PI 3,4,5-P3. The data shown are from 3 independent experiments with different vesicle preparations ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The association of activated PI 3-kinase with intracellular membranes enriched in GLUT4 reported here combined with other data presented in this study and our previous work (29.Heller-Harrison R. Morin M. Czech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Google Scholar) suggests the following hypothesis: membrane-bound IRS-1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon insulin stimulation, associates with PI 3-kinase, and is internalized on endosomal vesicles. A population of these IRS-1•PI 3-kinase complexes are delivered to the intracellular storage pool of GLUT4-containing vesicles. The products of PI 3-kinase catalytic action in GLUT4-containing vesicles cause budding, fusion, or movement of these membranes which regulates GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. The data in this study do not exclude the possibility that other mechanisms are involved in mediating increased PI 3-kinase activity in GLUT4-containing membranes in response to insulin nor do they address the mechanism by which PI 3-kinase and its 3′ phosphoinositide products trigger GLUT4 translocation, an important question for future investigation. However, a conceptual framework for the hypothetical activation of ADP-ribosylation factor-regulated vesicular fusion events by phosphoinositides is currently being developed(38.Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.-S. Cantley L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Google Scholar, 39.Liscovitch M. Cantley L. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Google Scholar).Recent data obtained from other laboratories also support the hypothesis that activated PI 3-kinase is involved in regulating GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes. For example, IRS-1 antisense constructs introduced into rat adipocytes transfected with epitope-tagged GLUT4 decreased the sensitivity to insulin of GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface(40.Quon M. Butte A. Zarnowski M. Sesti G. Cushman S. Taylor S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27920-27924Google Scholar). When IRS-1 was co-expressed in these cells, this effect was abolished. The specific insulin-mediated localization of PI 3-kinase to the specialized compartment that sequesters GLUT4 might also explain why activation of PI 3-kinase by other receptor signaling systems do not cause GLUT4 translocation(26.Isakoff S. Taha C. Rose E. Marcusohn J. Klip A. Skolnik E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10247-10251Google Scholar). Taken together, the data presented in this study and the findings of others are consistent with the hypothesis that PI 3-kinase is an essential component in the insulin signaling pathway leading to glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation. INTRODUCTIONOne of the major physiological effects of insulin is its ability to stimulate glucose uptake in adipose tissue and muscle(1.Cushman S. Wardzala L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Google Scholar, 2.Suzuki K. Kono T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Google Scholar). The acute stimulation of glucose transport rates in response to insulin is associated with the rapid translocation of GLUT4 transporters to the cell surface from an intracellular location, most likely within the tubulovesicular endosomal membrane system (for reviews see Refs. 3 and 4). Rapid appearance of GLUT4 on the cell surface in response to insulin has been well documented utilizing a variety of techniques including biochemical cell fractionation(1.Cushman S. Wardzala L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Google Scholar, 2.Suzuki K. Kono T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Google Scholar), photoaffinity labeling (5.Oka Y. Czech M. J. Biol.

Shah N. Lodish H. Jarrett L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6893-6897Google Scholar), and antibody binding assays of expressed epitope-tagged transporters(11.Kanai F. Nishioka Y.

Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Google Scholar). However, it is still not known how early events initiated by insulin binding to its cell surface receptor lead to increased glucose uptake.One early step in the insulin signaling pathway is the activation of PI 3-kinase 1The abbreviations used are: PIphosphatidylinositolIRS-1insulin receptor substrate 1SHSrc homologyBCAbicinchoninic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. secondary to the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on tyrosine residues (for reviews see (13.Keller S.

Phosphotyrosine residues specifically found within multiple YXXM motifs on IRS-1 have been demonstrated to bind Src homology 2 (SH2) domains present on the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase following insulin stimulation(17.Backer J. Myers M. Shoelson S. Chin D. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu. P. Margolis B. Skolnik E. Schlessinger J. White M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Google Scholar, 18.Yonezawa K. Ueda H. Hara K. Nishida K.

The binding of p85 to IRS-1 activates the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase which catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphoinositides at the D3 position of the inositol ring(17.Backer J. Myers M. Shoelson S. Chin D. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu. P. Margolis B. Skolnik E. Schlessinger J. White M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Google Scholar, 20.Kapeller R. Cantley L. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Google Scholar). A key role for 3′-phosphoinositides in membrane trafficking is suggested by studies on yeast PI 3-kinase, denoted VPS34, which is required for the proper delivery of soluble hydrolases to the yeast vacuole(21.Schu P. Takegawa K. Fry M. Stack J. Waterfield M. Emr S. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Google Scholar). Similarly, mutant platelet-derived growth factor and colony stimulating factor receptors lacking binding sites for PI 3-kinase are defective in their sorting to a degradative pathway(22.Carlberg K. Tapley P. Haystead C. Rohrschneider L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 877-883Google Scholar, 23.Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Google Scholar). That PI 3-kinase may also participate in insulin-dependent membrane trafficking of GLUT4 is suggested by the demonstration that inhibitors of PI 3-kinase activity abolish insulin-mediated translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in both 3T3-L1 and rat adipocytes(24.Cheatham B. Vlahos C. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Google Scholar, 25.Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Google Scholar). However, activation of PI 3-kinase by insulin cannot fully account for the effects of the enzyme on glucose transport since other receptor signaling systems activate PI 3-kinase activity to the same extent without causing translocation of GLUT4(26.Isakoff S. Taha C. Rose E. Marcusohn J. Klip A. Skolnik E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10247-10251Google Scholar). A critical aspect of this function of PI 3-kinase may therefore be its directed localization to the specialized intracellular membranes that sequester GLUT4.The above considerations have led us to hypothesize that insulin receptor activation causes the rapid delivery of IRS-1•PI 3-kinase complexes to intracellular GLUT4-enriched membranes where 3′-phosphoinositides may accumulate and function in the membrane-associated events which accompany the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface. The high concentration of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 present in intracellular low density microsomes (27.Kelly K. Ruderman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Google Scholar, 28.Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Google Scholar) and our recent finding that membrane association of IRS-1 can be regulated by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (29.Heller-Harrison R. Morin M. Czech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Google Scholar) reinforce this hypothesis. Two separate studies have reported that GLUT4-containing vesicles prepared from rat adipocytes do not contain PI 3-kinase, IRS-1, or insulin receptors(27.Kelly K. Ruderman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Google Scholar, 30.DelVecchio R. Pilch P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13278-13283Google Scholar). However, the insulin stimulations in these studies were for 10 min or longer. In the present studies, we tested the possibility that rapid association of activated IRS-1•PI 3-kinase complexes with the GLUT4-containing vesicles might occur. Our data demonstrate that insulin-activated PI 3-kinase indeed specifically associates with GLUT4-containing vesicles of both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and rat adipocytes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PI 3-kinase and its reaction products play a functional role in the movement of intracellular GLUT4 to the cell surface in response to insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1578817624,"The cytotoxic and antibacterial polypeptide NK-lysin has a molecular mass of approximately 9 kDa and contains three disulfide bonds. The activity was highly dependent on intact disulfides, because the bactericidal effect on Escherichia coli and the cytolytic effect on human 3B6 lymphocytes was inhibited when NK-lysin was treated with dithiothreitol prior to incubation with the cells. NK-lysin was a direct substrate for human or calf thymus thioredoxin reductase and preincubation of the peptide with mammalian thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH abolished its antibacterial and cytolytic activities. The addition of human thioredoxin further enhanced the inhibitory effect of thioredoxin reductase and NADPH. In contrast, E. coli thioredoxin reductase showed no direct disulfide reductase activity with NK-lysin in agreement with previous data showing large differences in structure and substrate specificity between the mammalian and E. coli enzymes. NK-lysin is the first identified macromolecular disulfide substrate for human thioredoxin reductase apart from human thioredoxin. When 3B6 cells were incubated with NADPH, thioredoxin, and thioredoxin reductase prior to addition of NK-lysin, cytotoxicity was markedly reduced. These data suggest that thioredoxin reductase inactivates NK-lysin and provides a mechanism by which the cytotoxic activity of NK-lysin is regulated.

In contrast, E. coli thioredoxin reductase showed no direct disulfide reductase activity with NK-lysin in agreement with previous data showing large differences in structure and substrate specificity between the mammalian and E. coli enzymes. NK-lysin is the first identified macromolecular disulfide substrate for human thioredoxin reductase apart from human thioredoxin. When 3B6 cells were incubated with NADPH, thioredoxin, and thioredoxin reductase prior to addition of NK-lysin, cytotoxicity was markedly reduced. These data suggest that thioredoxin reductase inactivates NK-lysin and provides a mechanism by which the cytotoxic activity of NK-lysin is regulated. INTRODUCTIONPeptide antibiotics are considered to be an important part of the innate immunity of animals(1.Boman H.G. Marsh J. Goode J.A. Ciba Foundation Symposium 186: Antimicrobial Peptides. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Chicester, UK1994Google Scholar, 2.Zasloff M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 3-7Google Scholar, 3.Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Google Scholar). A large number of antimicrobial peptides have been identified that are used under different physiological conditions. Many animals have circulating phagocytic cells containing antibiotic peptides stored in granula that participate in the destruction of engulfed bacteria(4.Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 229-230Google Scholar). The mucosal surfaces of the intestine, lung, and tongue have epithelial cells that produce antibiotic peptides (5.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23216-23225Google Scholar, 6.Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henscen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Google Scholar, 7.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 187-192Google Scholar, 8.Diamond G. Zasloff M. Eck H. Brasseur M. Maloy W.L. Bevins C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3952-3956Google Scholar, 9.Schonwetter B.S. Stolzenberg E.D. Zasloff M.A. Science. 1995; 267: 1645-1648Google Scholar) that are likely to act extracellularly and locally protect the host from microbial invasion. In insects, antibiotic peptides are released in the hemolymph and are potent host defense effector molecules. Animal peptides that have evolved to kill engulfed microbes inside phagocytic vacuoles may be cytotoxic also to the host as exemplified by mammalian defensin and bactenecin(10.Lehrer R.I. Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 105-128Google Scholar, 11.Radermacher S.W. Schoop V.M. Schluesener H.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 657-662Google Scholar). On the other hand peptide antibiotics that are delivered to the circulating system like insect cecropins (12.Boman H.G. Faye I. Gudmundsson G.H. Lee J.-Y. Lidholm D.-A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 23-31Google Scholar) and insect defensins (13.Hoffmann J.A. Hetru C. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 411-415Google Scholar) are not harmful to the producing organism. Although most of these peptides were discovered on the basis of the antimicrobial potency, other properties such as promotion of wound healing(14.Gallo R.L. Ono M. Povsic T. Page C. Eriksson E. Klagsbrun M. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11035-11039Google Scholar, 15.Kudryashov B.A. Kondashevskaya M.V. Lyapina L.A. Kokrfyakov V.N. Mazing Y.A. Shamova O.V. Bull. Exp. Biol. Med. 1990; 109: 513-515Google Scholar), stimulation of monocyte chemotaxis(16.Territo M.C. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R. J. Clin. Inv. 1989; 84: 2017-2020Google Scholar), and effects on intracellular signal transduction pathways (17.Mousli M. Bueb J. Bronner C. Rouot B. Landry Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 358-362Google Scholar, 18.Nakabayashi H. Brown J.H. Morell J.L. Chen H.C. Huang K.P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 135-138Google Scholar) have been reported. Recently, a novel antimicrobial peptide, NK-lysin, was isolated and shown to be present in CD2+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells, suggesting a function as effector peptide in T-lymphocytes(19.Andersson M. Gunne H. Agerberth B. Boman A. Bergman T. Sillard R. Jörnvall H. Mutt V. Olsson B. Wigzell H. Dagerlind Å. Boman G.H. Gudmundsson H.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1615-1625Google Scholar). NK-lysin is a cyst(e)ine-containing peptide that in addition to its antimicrobial activity is also cytotoxic to certain tumor cells but does not lyse red blood cells. The six cysteines in NK-lysin form three disulfide bonds that are well characterized(19.Andersson M. Gunne H. Agerberth B. Boman A. Bergman T. Sillard R. Jörnvall H. Mutt V. Olsson B. Wigzell H. Dagerlind Å. Boman G.H. Gudmundsson H.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1615-1625Google Scholar).Thioredoxin is a small protein (12 kDa) present in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells(20.Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar). In its oxidized form (Trx-S2), 1The abbreviations used are: TrxthioredoxinNKLNK-lysinTRthioredoxin reductaseDTTdithiothreitolHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyHP-TRthioredoxin reductase from human placenta. it contains a redox active disulfide with the sequence Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys localized in a protrusion of the known three-dimensional structure(21.Jeng M.-F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 853-868Google Scholar, 22.Holmgren A. Structure. 1995; 3: 239-243Google Scholar). Trx-S2 is reduced by the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase (20.Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar) and NADPH (the thioredoxin system), and Trx-(SH)2 operates as a general protein disulfide reductase (and)(Reactions 1 and 2): Trx−S2+NADPH+H+TR⇆Trx−(SH)2+NADP+Reaction 1 Trx−(SH)2+protein−S2+⇆Trx−S2+protein−(SH)2Reaction 2 The flow of electrons in catalysis by thioredoxin reductase is from NADPH to FAD and then to the active site disulfide, which forms a dithiol that reduces the disulfide of oxidized thioredoxin(23.Williams C.H.J. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). Escherichia coli TR has a molecular mass of 70 000, with two identical subunits and known three-dimensional structure(24.Waksman G. Krishna T.S.R. Williams C.H. Kuriyan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 800-816Google Scholar). Mammalian thioredoxin reductases are larger proteins (Mr 116,000) also with two identical subunits but a wider substrate specificity as compared with the E. coli enzyme(25.Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Google Scholar, 26.Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Google Scholar).The thioredoxin system has been implicated in a large variety of physiological processes(20.Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar). It serves, for example, as a hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase (27.Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Google Scholar) and a regulator of enzymes by thiol redox control(28.Holmgren A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1981; 6: 26-28Google Scholar). Trx also modulates the activity of transcription factors such as NF-κB(29.Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Google Scholar), AP-1(30.Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Google Scholar), and steroid receptors(31.Grippo J.F. Holmgren A. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 93-97Google Scholar, 32.Wiegand M. Ofenloch H.B. Eisele K. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 32: 53-58Google Scholar). More recently several cytokines or cytokine-like factors such as adult T cell leukemia-derived factor(33.Tagaya Y. Maeda Y. Mitsui A. Kondo N. Matsui H. Hamuro J. Brown N. Arai K. Yokota T. Wakasugi H. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 757-764Google Scholar), 3B6-interleukin-1(34.Wakasugi H. Rimsky L. Mahe Y. Kamel A.M. Fradelizi D. Tursz T. Bertoglio J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 804-808Google Scholar), T-hybridoma-derived (MP-6) B cell stimulatory factor(35.Rosén A. Lundman P. Carlsson M. Bhavani K. Srinivasa B.R. Kjellström G. Nilsson K. Holmgren A. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 625-633Google Scholar), and early pregnancy factor (36.Trapani G.D. Orosco C. Perkins A. Clarke F. Hum. Reprod. 1991; 6: 450-457Google Scholar) have been reported to be identical to thioredoxin. Trx is thus secreted by activated human lymphocytes(37.Ericson M.L. Hörling J. Wendel-Hansen V. Holmgren A. Rosen A. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1992; 11: 201-207Google Scholar). These results show that Trx has cytokine-like extracellular activities.In contrast to thioredoxin, which can act as a general disulfide oxidoreductase, thioredoxin reductase has only few known substrates. Beside small molecules like vitamin K, alloxan, and selenite(26.Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Google Scholar, 38.Holmgren A. Lyckeborg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5149-5152Google Scholar, 39.Kumar S. Björnstedt M. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 435-439Google Scholar), only Trx and proteins that contain thioredoxin domains (protein disulfide isomerase, CaBP1, and CaBP2) are known substrates for thioredoxin reductase(40.Lundstrom J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9114-9120Google Scholar, 41.Lundstrom-Ljung J. Birnbach U. Rupp K. Soling H.D. Holmgren A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 305-308Google Scholar). In addition to being located in the cytosol, thioredoxin reductase has been reported to be present on the plasma membranes as well as on the surface of some cancer cells and could be responsible for the reductive activation of extracellular Trx (42.Schallreuter K.U. Jänner M. Mensing H. Breitbart E.W. Berger J. Wood J.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 48: 15-19Google Scholar). Thus the Trx system may play an important role in modulating the activity of extracellularly circulating peptides and proteins. The Trx system has previously been shown to prevent toxic effects of venom neurotoxin (43.Lozano R.M. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 356-362Google Scholar) and cytolysis by tumor necrosis factor(44.Matsuda M. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Miyajima S. Yamauchi A. Yonehara S. Uchida A. Irimajiri K. Horiuchi A. Yodoi J. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3837-3841Google Scholar), but the mechanism of protection is not clear.In this report, we show that the antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of NK-lysin are dependent on intact disulfide bonds. NK-lysin kills human 3B6 lymphocytes, and this lytic effect may be inhibited by pretreatment of the peptide with thioredoxin reductase or the complete Trx system.MATERIALS AND METHODSRecombinant human thioredoxin was prepared as described by Ren et al.(45.Ren X. Björnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Google Scholar); E. coli thioredoxin and E. coli TR were prepared as described(20.Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar). Mammalian thioredoxin reductase was prepared from human placenta or calf thymus essentially as described by Luthman and Holmgren(26.Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Google Scholar). Yeast glutaredoxin reductase was from Sigma. RPMI medium was from Flow Laboratories (Ayshire, UK), and fetal calf serum, glutamine, and antibiotics were from Life Technologies, Inc. The cyto96 cytotoxic kit was from Promega. The columns used for HPLC analyses were: C18 column (Vydac 4.6 × 250 mm, The Separation Group, Hesperia, CA) and C8 column (Sephasil 2.1 × 10 mm, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). All other chemicals were from Sigma.Assay of Antibacterial ActivityThin plates (1 mm thick) were poured with LB broth plus Medium E(46.Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Google Scholar), 1% agarose, and about 6 × 104 cells/ml of E. coli D21(47.Hultmark D. Engström Å. Andersson K. Steiner H. Bennich H. Boman H.G. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 571-576Google Scholar). Small wells (diameter, 3 mm) were punched in the plates, and 3-μl test samples were applied in the wells. After overnight incubation at 30°C, the diameter of inhibition zones were recorded with a magnification lens with an internal mm scale. The activity was monitored as inhibition zones, and units were read from a standard plot of zone diameter against the log of the amounts of cecropin A.Assay of Cytotoxic ActivityThe cell lines used were 3B6 and 1G8, Eppstein-Barr virus-infected B cell lines originating from the lymphoblastoid cell line 721/84.5(48.Wakasugi N. Tagaya Y. Wakasugi H. Mitsui A. Maeda M. Yodoi J. Tursz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8282-8286Google Scholar), and U937, a human histocytic lymphoma cell line. They were maintained suspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, glutamine, and antibiotics in 5% CO2 atmosphere. For experiments, the cells were washed, viable cells were counted after trypan blue staining, and the cell density was adjusted to 2 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640, 2% fetal calf serum. Incubations were carried out in a 96-well flat microtiter plate at 37°C using 100 μl of target cell suspension and 10-20 μl of peptide sample diluted in medium (test) or medium only (control). Routinely, duplicate or triplicate determinations were made, and the specific lysis was calculated after 4-h incubations, measuring absorbance at 490 nm using the cyto96 cytotoxic kit. Total lysis was determined by adding lysis buffer to the cells. Specific lysis was calculated as (test A490 - control A490)/(total A490 - control A490).Reduction of NK-lysinReactions were carried out in a final volume of 10-40 μl in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.25 mM NADPH. All enzymes used were added and kept on ice prior to the addition of NK-lysin (final concentration, 20 μM) and subsequent incubation for 20 min at 37°C. The samples were then cooled on ice, and 3-μl samples were taken for antibacterial assay (or 15-μl samples for cytotoxic assays).HPLC and Amino Acid Sequence AnalysisFor HPLC analysis, columns were equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and applied material was eluted with a linear gradient of 20-60% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 40 min (C18 column; flow rate, 1 ml/min) or 0-40% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid during 30 min (C8 column; flow rate, 0.1 ml/min). Amino acid sequence analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystem 471 sequenator.RESULTSEffect of DTT on NK-lysin Antibacterial ActivityThe anti-E. coli activity of NK-lysin is apparently dependent on intact S-S bonds. Fig. 1 shows the effect of 20 min of treatment at 37°C of NK-lysin with various concentrations of DTT prior to incubation with bacteria. NK-lysin activity is dose-dependently inhibited by DTT, and at a 15-fold molar excess of DTT over half-cystines, a complete inactivation of anti-E. coli activity was observed. DTT only did not kill the cells at concentrations up to 5 mM, the highest concentration tested. The importance of intact S-S is in line with findings that the pore-forming activity of amoebapore A, a structurally similar peptide to NK-lysin, is also inactivated after DTT treatment (49.Leippe M. Tannich E. Nickel R. van der Goot G. Pattus F. Horstmann R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3501-3506Google Scholar).Reduction of NK-lysin by Thioredoxin ReductaseMammalian thioredoxin reductases from either human placenta (HP-TR) or from calf thymus gave similar results, both dose-dependently inactivating NK-lysin with a half-maximal inhibition of anti-E. coli activity at approximately 50 nM TR, a 400:1 peptide to enzyme ration on a molar basis (Fig. 2A). The inactivation was not species-specific because both enzymes gave similar results.Figure 2:Inhibition of NK-lysin anti-E. coli activity by TR and the Trx system. A, NKL (20 μM) was incubated with different concentrations of TR and 0.25 mM NADPH for 20 min prior to incubation with bacteria. ○, E. coli TR; ▵, human placenta TR; ◊, calf thymus TR. B, NKL (20 μM) was incubated with different concentrations of human Trx in the presence of 50 nME. coli (•) or human placenta TR (▲) and 0.25 mM NADPH prior to incubation with bacteria. The results are shown as percentages of the bactericidal effect obtained with nontreated NKL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In contrast to the mammalian enzyme, E. coli TR does not inactivate NK-lysin. Even higher concentrations of E. coli TR (up to 0.5 μM) did not show any effect. When NK-lysin was incubated with reduced human Trx or E. coli Trx alone at concentrations up to 5 μM, 100% of its anti-E. coli activity was preserved.We then tested if the complete thioredoxin system was a more efficient inactivating system. The concentrations of the HP-TR and the E. coli TR were kept constant at 50 nM while increasing concentrations of the homologous thioredoxins were used. As shown in Fig. 2B, human Trx dose-dependently enhanced the inactivation of NK-lysin anti-E. coli activity. E. coli Trx also inactivated NK-lysin when combined with E. coli TR but not as efficiently as the mammalian homologue. NK-lysin incubation with the Trx system was also performed in the presence of 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μM leupeptin, and 1 μM pepstatin with no change in the results (data not shown), demonstrating that the reduction in activity is not caused by enzymatic degradation.Protective Effect of Thioredoxin Reductase against NK-lysin CytotoxicityAs shown in Fig. 3, NK-lysin is a potent lytic agent of 3B6 cells, with approximately 50% of the cells lysed at 20 μg/ml (2.2 μM) after 4 h of incubation. NK-lysin also lysed the 1G8 cells as well as the transformed U937 cells at similar concentrations (data not shown). The lysis proceeds with a rapid initial phase and is clearly detected after 10 min. After that the lytic effect continues more slowly. The reason for this is not clear, but one explanation may be the heterogeneity of the cell population with some cells being more sensitive for NK-lysin than others.Figure 3:Time and concentration dependence of NK-lysin cell cytotoxicity. 3B6 cells (20 000/well) in 115 μl of RPMI 1640 medium plus 2% fetal calf serum were incubated with different concentrations of NKL, and the percentage of lysis was determined by the lactate dehydrogenase release method.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)When NK-lysin was preincubated with 2.5 mM DTT or 220 nM HP-TR or with the complete thioredoxin system (2.8 μM human Trx/60 nM HP-TR) and 0.25 mM NADPH prior to addition to 3B6 cells, more than 95% of the lytic effect was blocked (Fig. 4). If NK-lysin was incubated with 5 μM human Trx alone, there was no inactivating effect.Figure 4:Inhibition of NK-lysin cytotoxicity against 3B6 cells. NKL (20 μM) was incubated with 2.5 mM DTT, 5 μM human Trx, 220 nM HP-TR, or 60 nM HP-TR/2.8 μM human Trx and 0.25 mM NADPH for 20 min, and aliquots were added to 3B6 cells (20,000/well) to give a final concentration of 23 μg/ml NKL. The incubation was stopped after 4 h, and the percentage of lysis was determined by the lactate dehydrogenase release method.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Likewise, if 3B6 cells were incubated for 15 min with a fixed concentration of TR (25 nM) and increasing concentrations of human Trx prior to the addition of NK-lysin, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of the cytolytic activity (Fig. 5). This protective effect was not seen when the cells were incubated with human Trx alone. At present, the limited amount of TR available did not permit experiments with preincubation of cells with higher concentrations of TR only.Figure 5:Pretreatment of 3B6 cells with Trx system reduces NK-lysin cytotoxicity. 3B6 cells (20,000/well) were preincubated with human Trx or human Trx/HP-TR (25 nM) and 0.25 mM NADPH for 15 min prior to the addition of NKL (final concentration, 23 μg/ml). The incubation was stopped after 4 h, and the percentage of lysis was determined by the lactate dehydrogenase release method. The results are given as percentages of maximal lysis in the absence of Trx and TR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)HPLC Analyses of the TR-treated NK-lysinTo demonstrate that NK-lysin is reduced by thioredoxin reductase, 9 nmol NK-lysin were treated with 100 nM HP-TR for 45 min under identical conditions as described above. The -SH groups of the cysteines were labeled with 4-vinyl pyridine (2.85 μmol) for 2 h at room temperature, and the products were acidified and separated by reverse-phase HPLC on an analytical C18 column. The resulting chromatogram showed two major peaks, a and b, representing more than 70% of eluted material according to their absorbance at 214 nM (Fig. 6B). These two peaks were collected, concentrated, and subsequently digested with endoproteinase Asp-N, which cleaves NK-lysin at positions between all cysteines except Cys70 and Cys76 (Fig. 6A)(19.Andersson M. Gunne H. Agerberth B. Boman A. Bergman T. Sillard R. Jörnvall H. Mutt V. Olsson B. Wigzell H. Dagerlind Å. Boman G.H. Gudmundsson H.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1615-1625Google Scholar). The resulting fragments were separated by reverse-phase HPLC using an analytical C8 column (simultaneous detection at 214, 280, and 254 nm), and their identity was determined by either N-terminal sequencing or total amino acid composition.Figure 6:Schematic drawing of NK-lysin and the resulting chromatogram of TR-reduced and 4-vinyl pyridine-treated NK-lysin. A, schematic drawing of the S-S bonds in NK-lysin. B, NK-lysin was reduced by 100 nM TR and 0.25 mM NADPH, and the SH group of the cysteines was reacted with 4-vinyl pyridine and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 column.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)This analysis showed that in peak a all cysteines were alkylated, and in peak b all Cys35 and Cys45 were alkylated, whereas no alkylation was found in Cys4 and Cys7. This indicates that the Cys35-Cys45 disulfide bond is more amenable to reduction by TR than Cys4-Cys76 or Cys7-Cys70. NK-lysin not treated with TR and incubated in parallel with 4-vinyl pyridine did not change its elution mobility and gave no change in absorption at 280 nm, suggesting no interference of 4-vinyl pyridine with the disulfide bonds.DISCUSSIONMany effector molecules contribute to host immunity, and one group that may play an important role is the group of antibiotic peptides. At present, a large number of peptide sequences (or cDNA sequences coding for peptides) with antibiotic activity are known(3.Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Google Scholar). On a chemical basis, these peptides may be divided into groups based on structural similarities, e.g. (i) linear peptides devoid of cysteines, often forming amphipatic helices, (ii) linear peptides with a high proportion of certain residues like proline and arginine, (iii) loop-forming peptides with one disulfide bond, and (iv) peptides with one or more internal disulfide bonds.A 78-residue peptide, NK-lysin, belonging to group iv was recently purified from pig intestine and shown to have a disulfide pattern different from other members in this group like the α- and β-defensins(19.Andersson M. Gunne H. Agerberth B. Boman A. Bergman T. Sillard R. Jörnvall H. Mutt V. Olsson B. Wigzell H. Dagerlind Å. Boman G.H. Gudmundsson H.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1615-1625Google Scholar). Immunostaining with a polyclonal antibody against NKL co-stained with monoclonal markers for CD2+, CD4+, or CD8+, suggesting its presence in cytolytic T-lymphocytes (often localized in granules)(19.Andersson M. Gunne H. Agerberth B. Boman A. Bergman T. Sillard R. Jörnvall H. Mutt V. Olsson B. Wigzell H. Dagerlind Å. Boman G.H. Gudmundsson H.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1615-1625Google Scholar). Most, but not all, peptide antibiotics are believed to interact with the lipid bilayer and express their activity through membrane destruction. Defensins are postulated to form β-sheet structures that dimerize (50.Hill C.P. Yee J. Selsted M.E. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 251: 1481-1485Google Scholar) and interact with the lipid bilayer that may eventually form multimeric pores(51.Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1362-1373Google Scholar). The structure and mode of action is not known for NKL, but the structural similarities of NKL to the saposin-like family of peptides suggest that membrane interaction is likely to occur (52.Andersson M. Curstedt T. Jörnvall H. Johansson J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 328-332Google Scholar). Cysteine-rich peptides like snake toxins and amoebapore A are usually stable on exposure to acid or high temperature but loose all activity upon disulfide reduction(49.Leippe M. Tannich E. Nickel R. van der Goot G. Pattus F. Horstmann R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3501-3506Google Scholar, 53.Corft L.R. Handbook of Protein Sequence Analysis: A Compilation of Amino-acid Sequence of Proteins. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980: 422-453Google Scholar). On the other hand reduction of disulfide bonds in guinea pig defensin does not reduce its biological activities(54.Yamashita T. Yomogida S. Nagaoka I. Saito K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1243: 295-299Google Scholar). NK-lysin also resists 100°C for 10 min but is inactivated by DTT. Thus it was of interest to investigate if the thioredoxin system could modulate the activity of NK-lysin because NK-lysin is potentially an effector peptide of pig cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Trx has been shown to have many extracellular activities, some playing a role as mediators in the immune system or as regulators of cell growth (35.Rosén A. Lundman P. Carlsson M. Bhavani K. Srinivasa B.R. Kjellström G. Nilsson K. Holmgren A. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 625-633Google Scholar, 48.Wakasugi N. Tagaya Y. Wakasugi H. Mitsui A. Maeda M. Yodoi J. Tursz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8282-8286Google Scholar, 55.Yamauchi A. Masutani H. Tagaya Y. Wakasugi N. Mitsui A. Nakamura H. Inamoto T. Ozawa K. Yodoi J. Mol. Immunol. 1992; 29: 263-270Google Scholar) in an autocrine manner. Trx may also prevent venom neurotoxin (43.Lozano R.M. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 356-362Google Scholar) and tumor necrosis factor (44.Matsuda M. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Miyajima S. Yamauchi A. Yonehara S. Uchida A. Irimajiri K. Horiuchi A. Yodoi J. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3837-3841Google Scholar) cytotoxic effects. In this report we show that thioredoxin reductase alone or the complete Trx system can inhibit the antibacterial and cytotoxic effects of NK-lysin.The Trx system has a broad substrate specificity and can reduce disulfides in a number of proteins and peptides (56.Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar) and also inhibits the anti-E. coli activity of NK-lysin, most probably by reduction of disulfides. Thioredoxin reductase has a narrower substrate specificity than Trx, and so far only a limited number of substrates, all proteins containing thioredoxin domains, are identified(40.Lundstrom J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9114-9120Google Scholar, 41.Lundstrom-Ljung J. Birnbach U. Rupp K. Soling H.D. Holmgren A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 305-308Google Scholar). Interestingly, NK-lysin is inactivated by mammalian TR in the absence of Trx and represents a new substrate for TR. E. coli TR is more substrate-specific than mammalian TR (56.Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar) and does not affect the activity of NKL (this might be a positive factor for the anti-E. coli activity of NKL). Another protein with thiol-disulfide reductase activity present in mammalian cells is glutaredoxin, which is reduced by glutathione and glutathione reductase, the glutaredoxin system(57.Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Google Scholar). Both human and E. coli glutaredoxin efficiently inactivate NK-lysin when combined with yeast glutaredoxin reductase, glutathione, and NADPH. 2M. Andersson, A. Holmgren, and G. Spyrou, unpublished results. The complete system was needed, and no single component showed any effect.NK-lysin is cytolytic for the mouse tumor cell line YAC-1 (19.Andersson M. Gunne H. Agerberth B. Boman A. Bergman T. Sillard R. Jörnvall H. Mutt V. Olsson B. Wigzell H. Dagerlind Å. Boman G.H. Gudmundsson H.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1615-1625Google Scholar) and also kills virus-infected B-lymphocytes (3B6) as well as other cells (1G8 and U937) at similar half-maximal concentrations (2-5 μM). In contrast with defensin(58.Lichtenstein A. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R.I. Blood. 1986; 68: 1407-1410Google Scholar), the lysis proceeds rapidly and is clearly detected within 10 min compared with a lag time of approximately 4 h for defensin. Also, NKL lytic activity is not efficiently quenched by serum protein ((19.Andersson M. Gunne H. Agerberth B. Boman A. Bergman T. Sillard R. Jörnvall H. Mutt V. Olsson B. Wigzell H. Dagerlind Å. Boman G.H. Gudmundsson H.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1615-1625Google Scholar) and this paper) as is the case with defensin(58.Lichtenstein A. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R.I. Blood. 1986; 68: 1407-1410Google Scholar). At present, red blood cells are the only example of mammalian cells not lysed by NKL. The reason for this is not clear. TR appears not to specifically reduce a particular disulfide bond in NKL because all cysteines could be modified by 4-vinyl pyridine. However Cys35-Cys45 was preferentially reduced because no Cys35-Cys45 bond could be found in the partially reduced NK-lysin.Thioredoxin reductase has been reported to be associated with plasma membranes and in some cells to be present on the surface. Thus, the amount of thioredoxin reductase in different cell types may influence the sensitivity of certain cells to NK-lysin. Thioredoxin reductase as well as thioredoxin vary during the cell cycle, reaching a maximum at the S phase and are decreased when cells enter G2/M. 3G. Spyrou, unpublished results. These variations during the cell cycle, and the heterogeneity of the cell population may explain why NKL lysis proceeds with a fast initial rate (Fig. 3). Immunohistochemical localization showed that TR and Trx and colocalized in most cells. Nevertheless, there are cells, e.g. spermatocytes and Sertoli cells, that are positive for thioredoxin reductase but negative for thioredoxin(59.Rozell B. Hansson H.A. Luthman M. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 79-86Google Scholar). These observations suggest that thioredoxin reductase has more functions than reducing thioredoxin.Thus, we describe a novel mechanism by which the cytotoxic effect of NK-lysin can be inhibited. The direct action of thioredoxin reductase alone or of the thioredoxin system can inactivate NK-lysin and could play a role in modulating NK-lysin cytotoxicity. However, other mechanisms such as dilution or quenching by protein absorption may also reduce the toxic effect of NK-lysin. INTRODUCTIONPeptide antibiotics are considered to be an important part of the innate immunity of animals(1.Boman H.G. Marsh J. Goode J.A. Ciba Foundation Symposium 186: Antimicrobial Peptides. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Chicester, UK1994Google Scholar, 2.Zasloff M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 3-7Google Scholar, 3.Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Google Scholar). A large number of antimicrobial peptides have been identified that are used under different physiological conditions. Many animals have circulating phagocytic cells containing antibiotic peptides stored in granula that participate in the destruction of engulfed bacteria(4.Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 229-230Google Scholar). The mucosal surfaces of the intestine, lung, and tongue have epithelial cells that produce antibiotic peptides (5.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23216-23225Google Scholar, 6.Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henscen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Google Scholar, 7.Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 187-192Google Scholar, 8.Diamond G. Zasloff M. Eck H. Brasseur M. Maloy W.L. Bevins C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3952-3956Google Scholar, 9.Schonwetter B.S. Stolzenberg E.D. Zasloff M.A. Science. 1995; 267: 1645-1648Google Scholar) that are likely to act extracellularly and locally protect the host from microbial invasion. In insects, antibiotic peptides are released in the hemolymph and are potent host defense effector molecules. Animal peptides that have evolved to kill engulfed microbes inside phagocytic vacuoles may be cytotoxic also to the host as exemplified by mammalian defensin and bactenecin(10.Lehrer R.I. Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 105-128Google Scholar, 11.Radermacher S.W. Schoop V.M. Schluesener H.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 657-662Google Scholar). On the other hand peptide antibiotics that are delivered to the circulating system like insect cecropins (12.Boman H.G. Faye I. Gudmundsson G.H. Lee J.-Y. Lidholm D.-A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 23-31Google Scholar) and insect defensins (13.Hoffmann J.A. Hetru C. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 411-415Google Scholar) are not harmful to the producing organism. Although most of these peptides were discovered on the basis of the antimicrobial potency, other properties such as promotion of wound healing(14.Gallo R.L. Ono M. Povsic T. Page C. Eriksson E. Klagsbrun M. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11035-11039Google Scholar, 15.Kudryashov B.A. Kondashevskaya M.V. Lyapina L.A. Kokrfyakov V.N. Mazing Y.A. Shamova O.V. Bull. Exp.

Inv. 1989; 84: 2017-2020Google Scholar), and effects on intracellular signal transduction pathways (17.Mousli M. Bueb J. Bronner C. Rouot B. Landry Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 358-362Google Scholar, 18.Nakabayashi H. Brown J.H. Morell J.L. Chen H.C. Huang K.P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 135-138Google Scholar) have been reported. Recently, a novel antimicrobial peptide, NK-lysin, was isolated and shown to be present in CD2+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells, suggesting a function as effector peptide in T-lymphocytes(19.Andersson M. Gunne H. Agerberth B. Boman A. Bergman T. Sillard R. Jörnvall H. Mutt V. Olsson B. Wigzell H. Dagerlind Å. Boman G.H. Gudmundsson H.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1615-1625Google Scholar). NK-lysin is a cyst(e)ine-containing peptide that in addition to its antimicrobial activity is also cytotoxic to certain tumor cells but does not lyse red blood cells. The six cysteines in NK-lysin form three disulfide bonds that are well characterized(19.Andersson M. Gunne H. Agerberth B. Boman A. Bergman T. Sillard R. Jörnvall H. Mutt V. Olsson B. Wigzell H. Dagerlind Å. Boman G.H. Gudmundsson H.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1615-1625Google Scholar).Thioredoxin is a small protein (12 kDa) present in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells(20.Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar). In its oxidized form (Trx-S2), 1The abbreviations used are: TrxthioredoxinNKLNK-lysinTRthioredoxin reductaseDTTdithiothreitolHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyHP-TRthioredoxin reductase from human placenta. it contains a redox active disulfide with the sequence Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys localized in a protrusion of the known three-dimensional structure(21.Jeng M.-F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 853-868Google Scholar, 22.Holmgren A. Structure. 1995; 3: 239-243Google Scholar). Trx-S2 is reduced by the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase (20.Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar) and NADPH (the thioredoxin system), and Trx-(SH)2 operates as a general protein disulfide reductase (and)(Reactions 1 and 2): Trx−S2+NADPH+H+TR⇆Trx−(SH)2+NADP+Reaction 1 Trx−(SH)2+protein−S2+⇆Trx−S2+protein−(SH)2Reaction 2 The flow of electrons in catalysis by thioredoxin reductase is from NADPH to FAD and then to the active site disulfide, which forms a dithiol that reduces the disulfide of oxidized thioredoxin(23.Williams C.H.J. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). Escherichia coli TR has a molecular mass of 70 000, with two identical subunits and known three-dimensional structure(24.Waksman G. Krishna T.S.R. Williams C.H. Kuriyan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 800-816Google Scholar). Mammalian thioredoxin reductases are larger proteins (Mr 116,000) also with two identical subunits but a wider substrate specificity as compared with the E. coli enzyme(25.Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Google Scholar, 26.Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Google Scholar).The thioredoxin system has been implicated in a large variety of physiological processes(20.Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar). It serves, for example, as a hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase (27.Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Google Scholar) and a regulator of enzymes by thiol redox control(28.Holmgren A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1981; 6: 26-28Google Scholar). Trx also modulates the activity of transcription factors such as NF-κB(29.Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Google Scholar), AP-1(30.Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Google Scholar), and steroid receptors(31.Grippo J.F. Holmgren A. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 93-97Google Scholar, 32.Wiegand M. Ofenloch H.B. Eisele K. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 32: 53-58Google Scholar). More recently several cytokines or cytokine-like factors such as adult T cell leukemia-derived factor(33.Tagaya Y. Maeda Y. Mitsui A. Kondo N. Matsui H. Hamuro J. Brown N. Arai K. Yokota T. Wakasugi H. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 757-764Google Scholar), 3B6-interleukin-1(34.Wakasugi H. Rimsky L. Mahe Y. Kamel A.M. Fradelizi D. Tursz T. Bertoglio J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 804-808Google Scholar), T-hybridoma-derived (MP-6) B cell stimulatory factor(35.Rosén A. Lundman P. Carlsson M. Bhavani K. Srinivasa B.R. Kjellström G. Nilsson K. Holmgren A. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 625-633Google Scholar), and early pregnancy factor (36.Trapani G.D. Orosco C. Perkins A. Clarke F. Hum. Reprod. 1991; 6: 450-457Google Scholar) have been reported to be identical to thioredoxin. Trx is thus secreted by activated human lymphocytes(37.Ericson M.L. Hörling J. Wendel-Hansen V. Holmgren A. Rosen A. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1992; 11: 201-207Google Scholar). These results show that Trx has cytokine-like extracellular activities.In contrast to thioredoxin, which can act as a general disulfide oxidoreductase, thioredoxin reductase has only few known substrates. Beside small molecules like vitamin K, alloxan, and selenite(26.Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Google Scholar, 38.Holmgren A. Lyckeborg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5149-5152Google Scholar, 39.Kumar S. Björnstedt M. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 435-439Google Scholar), only Trx and proteins that contain thioredoxin domains (protein disulfide isomerase, CaBP1, and CaBP2) are known substrates for thioredoxin reductase(40.Lundstrom J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9114-9120Google Scholar, 41.Lundstrom-Ljung J. Birnbach U. Rupp K. Soling H.D. Holmgren A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 305-308Google Scholar). In addition to being located in the cytosol, thioredoxin reductase has been reported to be present on the plasma membranes as well as on the surface of some cancer cells and could be responsible for the reductive activation of extracellular Trx (42.Schallreuter K.U. Jänner M. Mensing H. Breitbart E.W. Berger J. Wood J.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 48: 15-19Google Scholar). Thus the Trx system may play an important role in modulating the activity of extracellularly circulating peptides and proteins. The Trx system has previously been shown to prevent toxic effects of venom neurotoxin (43.Lozano R.M. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 356-362Google Scholar) and cytolysis by tumor necrosis factor(44.Matsuda M. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Miyajima S. Yamauchi A. Yonehara S. Uchida A. Irimajiri K. Horiuchi A. Yodoi J. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3837-3841Google Scholar), but the mechanism of protection is not clear.In this report, we show that the antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of NK-lysin are dependent on intact disulfide bonds. NK-lysin kills human 3B6 lymphocytes, and this lytic effect may be inhibited by pretreatment of the peptide with thioredoxin reductase or the complete Trx system."

To identify phosphorylation sites and characterize the Vif kinase(s), Vif was expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and purified for use as a substrate in <i>in vitro</i> kinase assays.

https://openalex.org/W2135116510,"Hsp90, one of the most prominent proteins in eucaryotic cells under physiological and stress conditions, chaperones protein folding reactions in an ATP-independent way. Surprisingly, ATP binding and ATPase activity of Hsp90 has been reported by several groups. To clarify this important issue, we have reinvestigated the potential ATP binding properties and ATPase activity of highly purified Hsp90 using a number of different techniques.Hsp90 was compared to the well characterized ATP-binding chaperone Hsc70 and to two control proteins, immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, that are known to not bind ATP. Hsp90 behaved very similarly to the non-ATP-binding proteins and very differently from the ATP-binding protein Hsc70. Like bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin G, Hsp90 (i) did not bind to immobilized ATP, (ii) could not be specifically photocross-linked with azido-ATP, (iii) failed to exhibit significant changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence upon ATP addition, and (iv) did not bind to three fluorescent ADP analogues. In contrast, Hsc70 strongly bound ATP and ADP, specifically cross-linked with azido-ATP, and exhibited major shifts in fluorescence upon addition of ATP. Finally, reexamination of the amino acid sequence of Hsp90 failed to reveal any significant homologies to known ATP-binding motifs. Taken together, we conclude that highly purified Hsp90 does not bind ATP. Weak ATPase activities associated with Hsp90 preparations may be due to minor impurities or kinases copurifying with Hsp90.

INTRODUCTIONCells respond to external stresses such as a sudden increase in temperature with the synthesis of a distinct set of proteins called heat shock or stress proteins (Nover, 1991). The predominant classes of stress proteins including GroE, Hsc70, 1The abbreviations used are: Hsc70/Hsp7070-kDa heat shock proteinCScitrate synthaseGdmClguanidinium chlorideBSAbovine serum albuminIgGimmunoglobulin GFab fragmentantigen-binding fragment of antibodiesPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMABA-ADPN-8-(4-N′-methylanthranylaminobutyl)-8aminoadenosine diphosphateMANT-ADP3′-O-N-methyl-anthraniloyl diphosphateΣ-ADPetheno-ADP. Hsp90, and small Hsps have been implicated in protein folding as molecular chaperones (Morimoto et al., 19.Morimoto R.I. Tissi é res A. Georgopolous C.(eds) Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar; Jakob and Buchner, 10.Jakob U. Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 205-211Google Scholar; Buchner, 4.Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-20Google Scholar). While the precise molecular mechanism of these chaperones is still under extensive investigation, the ATP dependence of chaperone-mediated protein folding is clearly the hallmark of the GroE and Hsc70 class of stress proteins. Both the ATPase activity of these proteins and its influence on assisted protein folding have been analyzed in detail (cf. Morimoto et al., 1994). In contrast, conflicting evidence exists concerning Hsp90's ATP binding properties and ATPase activity. Hsp90 is one of the most abundant proteins in the eucaryotic cell, even at physiological conditions. In complex with other effector proteins such as Hsc70 and prolyl isomerases, Hsp90 has been implicated as a molecular chaperone in the maturation of specific protein substrates such as steroid receptors and kinases in vivo (Pratt, 26.Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21455-21458Google Scholar; Smith et al., 32.Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Johnson J. Toft D.O. Moudgil V.K. Steroid Hormone Receptors. Birkh ä user, Boston1993: 247-258Google Scholar; Jakob and Buchner, 1994; Buchner, 1996). Interestingly, assembly of these complexes with substrate proteins has been found to be ATP-dependent (Pratt, 1993; Smith et al., 1993). However, since Hsc70 is also involved in the formation of these high molecular weight assemblies, it is not yet clear which of the Hsps is responsible for the ATP requirement. More recently, using in vitro folding and unfolding assays, it has been demonstrated that Hsp90 may be a general cytosolic chaperone under physiological (Wiech et al., 36.Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. Nature. 1992; 358: 169-170Google Scholar; Shaknovich et al., 29.Shaknovich R. Shue G. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 5059-5068Google Scholar; Shue and Kohtz, 31.Shue G. Kohtz D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2707-2711Google Scholar) and heat shock conditions (Jakob et al., 11.Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Google Scholar; Schumacher et al., 28.Schumacher R.J. Hurst R. Sullivan W.P. McMahon N.J. Toft D.O. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9493-9499Google Scholar). These chaperone functions as well as interactions of Hsp90 with estrogen receptors (Inano et al., 9.Inano K. Curtis S.W. Korach K.S. Omata S. Horigome T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 759-766Google Scholar) were found to be ATP-independent. In contrast, binding of ATP to Hsp90 has been reported (Csermely and Kahn, 6.Csermely P. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4350-4943Google Scholar). Binding of ATP was suggested to result in conformational changes of Hsp90 (Csermely et al., 37.Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann M. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7414-7421Google Scholar), which in turn would affect the interaction with other proteins (Kellermayer and Csermely, 14.Kellermayer M.S.Z. Csermely P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 166-174Google Scholar). In addition evidence was presented suggesting that some purified Hsp90 preparations exhibit potent peptide-stimulated ATPase activity with high turnover numbers (Nadeau et al., 20.Nadeau K. Sullivan M.A. Bradley M. Engman D.M. Walsh C.T. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 970-979Google Scholar; 21.Nadeau K. Das A. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1479-1487Google Scholar). However, Hsp90 purified from other species did not show ATPase activity (Wiech et al., 1993; Nardai et al., 1995).Whether Hsp90 acts in an ATP-dependent or independent way is of crucial importance for understanding the molecular mechanism of this chaperone. Therefore we have examined the ATP binding properties of Hsp90 in detail using several independent experimental approaches. By including known ATP-binding or non-ATP-binding proteins as positive and negative controls, we were able to show that several of the methods employed previously are not suited to unambiguously demonstrate ATP binding. Those methods that turned out to be reliable demonstrate that Hsp90 does not bind ATP.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteinsHsp90 and Hsc70 from bovine pancreas as well as Hsp90 from yeast and Escherichia coli were purified as described previously (Wiech et al., 1993; Jakob et al., 1995a, 12.Jakob U. Meyer I. Bügl H. André S. Bardwell J.C.A. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14412-14419Google Scholar). In addition, heparin-Sepharose was used as a final step in the purification of Hsp90 (Olsson et al., 24.Olsson H. Martinez-Arias W. Drobak B.K. Jergil B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 282-286Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of bovine Hsp90 and Hsc70 were determined according to Bradford(3.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Yeast Hsp90 concentrations were obtained using the published extinction coefficient of 0.73 for a 0.1% solution at 280 nm (Jakob et al., 1995a). Mitochondrial citrate synthase (CS) (EC 4.1.3.7), BSA, RNase A, MAK33 IgG, and the respective Fab fragment were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH.ChemicalsC8-ATP-agarose was purchased from Sigma, 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]ATP were from ICN and ATP was from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH. Polyethyleneimine-cellulose was obtained from Schleicher & Schüll.Analysis of the Nucleotide Content of Hsp90Nucleotides were analyzed by reverse phase chromatography with a 2-ml C18 column (Bishop). Detection was at 254 nm. The isocratic elution system consisted of 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, for the analysis of AMP/ADP/ATP and 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 10 mM tetrabutylammonium bromide, [N(C4H9)4]Br, and 8% (v/v) acetonitrile for the analysis of GMP/GDP/GTP. Typical retention times for the adenosine nucleotides were 3.3 min (ATP), 3.9 min (ADP), and 4.8 min (AMP) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min at room temperature. The retention times for the guanosine nucleotides were 4.7 min (GTP), 3.4 min (GDP), and 2.5 min (GMP) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min.Prior to injection, the protein was denatured to dissociate any bound nucleotides by the addition of 2 μl of 1 M HClO4 to 20 μl of protein solution. The solution was then kept on ice for 1 min, and 28 μl of 2 M potassium acetate was added to reach neutral pH. The sample was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 1 min, and 10 μl of the supernatant was analyzed for nucleotide content as described above.Chaperone AssayThe influence of Hsp90 and Hsc70 on the thermal aggregation process of CS at 43°C was monitored in the absence or presence of 1 mM MgATP as described previously (Jakob et al., 1995a).ATP-agarose1 ml of ATP-agarose was used in a batch binding procedure at 4°C in Eppendorf tubes. Each batch was equilibrated with buffer A (40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 20 mM KCl, 5% glycerol and 5 mM MgCl2). Equilibration was performed by resuspending the column material in 2 resin volumes of equilibration buffer, mixing it on a rotating shaker for 10 min, and then centrifuging it at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the procedure was repeated five times. 200 μg yeast Hsp90 or bovine Hsc70 were mixed with 5 mg/ml IgG carrier protein and made up to 1 ml with buffer A. The protein mixtures were added to the equilibrated ATP-agarose, and these were incubated for 24 h rotating at 4°C. The samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was retained on ice for further analysis. The ATP-agarose was then washed five times with buffer A. For each wash, the ATP-agarose was incubated in 1 resin volume of buffer A for 10 min on a rotating shaker and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm. After each centrifugation, the supernatant was retained on ice (wash 1). The agarose pellet was then washed five times as described with high salt buffer (buffer A + 0.5 M KCl), and each time the supernatant was stored on ice at 4°C (wash 2). Dissociation of specifically bound protein was initiated by the addition of buffer A supplemented with 0.5 M KCl and 5 mM ATP. This procedure was repeated five times. Finally, the ATP-agarose was washed with 2 resin volumes of 7 M urea in buffer A. Samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. All gels were silver-stained.Cross-linking with 8-Azido-[α-32P] ATPYeast Hsp90 (5 μg) or BSA (5 μg) were diluted into 40 mM HEPES-KOH, 10 mM MgCl2, 40 μM 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, pH 7.5, which was supplemented with various concentrations of non-radioactive ATP. The final volume was 20 μl. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, samples were placed on ice and cross-linking was induced by a 6 min UV radiation (256 nm) at a distance of 4 cm. After addition of 5 μl of 5 × Laemmli buffer (+ 5% β-mercaptoethanol), the samples were incubated for 5 min at 95°C and applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE. Finally the gel was autoradiographed.ATPase ActivityATPase assays were performed as described previously (Kornberg et al., 16.Kornberg A. Scott J.F. Bertsch L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3298-3304Google Scholar; Knarr et al., 15.Knarr G. Gething M.-J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Google Scholar). 4-10 μg of purified yeast Hsp90 or RNaseA were incubated at 37°C with 100 μM unlabeled ATP, 0.1 μM [α-32P]ATP in 40 mM HEPES-KOH, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5. In some experiments with Hsp90, 1 mM MnCl2 or CaCl2 was used instead of MgCl2. Various time points after start of the incubation aliquots of 3 μl were added to 2 μl of nucleotide-EDTA-mix (12 mM ATP, ADP, AMP, EDTA) to terminate the reaction. Thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose was performed in 0.5 M LiCl and 2 N formic acid. The polyethyleneimine-cellulose sheets were dried, the spots corresponding to ATP and ADP located with UV-light and excised. The radioactivity in each spot was determined by liquid scintillation and expressed as a fraction of the total recovered radioactivity in each lane.GdmCl-induced Unfolding of Yeast Hsp90The unfolding transitions of yeast Hsp90 were monitored by measuring the change in intrinsic fluorescence. The measurements were performed in a 1-cm quartz cuvette in a Perkin-Elmer MPF44A luminescence spectrometer at 20°C. The tryptophan fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and an emission wavelength of 325 nm. The slit widths were set to 5 nm and 10 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. GdmCl-induced unfolding of yeast Hp90 was performed by dilution of the protein into various concentrations of GdmCl in 40 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2 (buffer B). The respective protein concentrations are given in the figure legends. The samples were incubated for 20 h at 20°C to achieve equilibrium. To study the influence of ATP on the stability of yeast Hsp90, GdmCl-induced unfolding was performed as described in the presence and absence of 2 mM ATP.Influence of ATP on the Fluorescence of Yeast Hsp90, Bovine Hsc70, BSA, and IgGThe respective proteins were diluted into various concentrations of ATP in buffer B. The respective protein concentrations are given in the figure legends. The samples were incubated for 1 min at 20°C to achieve equilibrium. Subsequently fluorescence measurements were carried out in a 3-mm quartz cuvette as described above. Fluorescence intensities are expressed as the percentage of total protein fluorescence obtained after subtracting the background intensity of the buffer. Changes in tryptophan fluorescence were corrected for the absorption of ATP (inner filter effect) at 295 nm excitation using the formula, Fcorr=Fobs.a/1−e−a(witha=2.303.LT.eL)(Eq. 1) where Fcorr is the corrected fluorescence and Fobs is the observed fluorescence after subtracting the background light intensity, LT is the total ATP concentration, and ΣL is the absorption coefficient of ATP (Birdsall et al., 1.Birdsall B. King R.W. Wheeler M.R. Lewis C.A. Goode S.R. Dunlap B. Roberts G.C.K. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 353-361Google Scholar).Analysis of the Binding of Labeled ADP to Hsp90Fluorescence measurements were performed with an SLM Smart 8000 Photon-Counting spectrofluorimeter (SLM Instruments) at 25°C. Unless otherwise indicated, the buffer was 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, and 2 mM MgCl2.The fluorescent nucleotides were added to 1 ml of buffer at the concentrations indicated. Subsequently, protein was added and mixed manually. All data are volume-corrected averages of 10 readings of 1-s intervals of photon counting.The nucleotide analogues 3′-O-N-methyl-anthraniloyl diphosphate (MANT-ADP), N-8-(4-N′-methylanthranylaminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine diphosphate (MABA-ADP), and etheno-ADP (Σ-ADP) were employed to analyze binding of adenosine nucleotides to Hsp90. The concentrations used were 0.4 μM for the nucleotides and up to 0.85 μM for Hsp90. The emission wavelengths of Σ-ADP, MABA-ADP, and MANT-ADP were 410, 422, and 440 nm, respectively, and the according excitation wavelengths were 300, 340, and 360 nm.In control experiments binding of MABA-ADP to the molecular chaperone DnaK (Hsc70 from E. coli) was determined by fluorescence. In contrast to MANT-ADP, this nucleotide analogue binds with high affinity to DnaK. 2H. Theyssen, H.-P. Schuster, B. Bukau, and J. Reinstein, submitted for publication. The conditions used were: 0.4 μM MABA-ADP, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithioerythritol, 25°C. The emission wavelength was 422 nm, and the excitation wavelength was 340 nm.For competition experiments, 1 mM non-labeled ADP was added to the respective protein-ADP analogue incubation reaction and the fluorescence was monitored.RESULTSPurified Hsp90 Is Free of NucleotidesHsp90 from different sources (bovine, yeast, E. coli) was purified by column chromatography to homogeneity (>98%) as determined by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels. To examine whether purified Hsp90 contains bound nucleotide, we determined the A280/260 ratio. UV spectra of Hsp90 gave typically an A280/260 ratio of 1.8-1.9, suggesting that the protein samples were essentially nucleotide-free. To confirm this result, we analyzed the nucleotide content of purified yeast Hsp90 by reversed phase high performance liquid chromotagraphy under denaturing conditions. Neither adenosine nor guanosine nucleotides could be detected (data not shown). Together these results demonstrate that, unlike other ATP-dependent chaperones such as GroE and Hsc70, purified Hsp90 does not contain bound nucleotides.The Chaperone Activity of Hsp90 Is ATP-independentTo compare the influence of ATP on the chaperone activity of Hsp90 with that of Hsc70, a known ATP-dependent chaperone, we performed in vitro unfolding assays in the presence or absence of ATP with both proteins. As an assay system, we used the thermal unfolding of CS. We had shown previously that Hsp90 suppresses the unspecific aggregation during thermal unfolding and apparently stabilizes CS against inactivation by binding to early unfolding intermediates (Jakob et al., 1995a). As shown in Fig. 1, 1 mM MgATP has no influence on the suppression of CS aggregation by Hsp90. In contrast, suppression of aggregation by Hsc70 is strongly influenced by ATP. This suggests fundamentally different mechanisms of action. In the absence of ATP, Hsc70 effectively prevents aggregation by binding the nonnative protein. In the presence of ATP, however, the protective effect of Hsc70 is lost possibly due to the rapid release and subsequent aggregation of bound protein. Similar effects were observed previously for the chaperone GroE under heat shock conditions (Höll-Neugebauer et al., 1992).Hsp90 Does Not Bind to ATP-agaroseBinding to immobilized ATP has been taken as evidence for the association of Hsp90 with nucleotides (Csermely and Kahn, 1991). We readdressed the question whether purified Hsp90 binds to immobilized ATP by incubating Hsp90 with ATP-agarose. Initial experiments showed that the addition of the carrier protein IgG was necessary to prevent the unspecific interaction of Hsp90 with the agarose matrix. IgG was shown not to influence the specific binding of the control protein Hsc70 (Fig. 2). To detect specific binding of proteins to ATP-agarose, elution of the bound proteins was induced by competing with free ATP after extensive salt washes. These experiments confirmed that Hsc70 binds to immobilized ATP and can be specifically eluted by the addition of free ATP. However, specific binding of Hsp90 to ATP-agarose could not be detected. The total amount of Hsp90 applied was found in the flow-through and the wash fractions. Addition of divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+) to the incubation buffer did not change the results (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that Hsp90 does not bind tightly to immobilized ATP.Figure 2:Binding of yeast Hsp90 and bovine Hsc70 to ATP-agarose. 200 μg of yeast Hsp90 (A) or bovine Hsc70 (B) were mixed with 5 mg of IgG in buffer A containing 5 mM MgCl2, and these were loaded on to 1 ml of ATP-agarose preequilibrated in the same buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A, lane 1, load; lane 2, supernatant; lanes 3 and 4, wash 1; lanes 5 and 6, wash 2; lanes 7-9, ATP elution. B, lane 1, load; lane 2, supernatant; lanes 3 and 4, wash 1; lanes 5-7, wash 2; lanes 8-10, ATP elution. Heavy and light IgG chains are denoted by H and L, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Azido-ATP Cross-linking to Hsp90 Is NonspecificPreviously, cross-linking of radiolabeled azido-ATP to Hsp90 has been detected (Csermely and Kahn, 1991; Shaknovich et al., 8.Höll-Neugebauer B. Schmidt M. Rudolph R. Buchner J. Biochemistry. 1992; 30: 11614-16009Google Scholar). To investigate whether this represents specific interactions, we compared the cross-linking behavior of Hsp90 with that of the known ATP-binding protein Hsc70 and the non-ATP-binding protein BSA. Competition with cold ATP was used to check the specificity of the cross-linking reaction.As shown in Fig. 3, cross-linking of azido-ATP to Hsp90 was observed under the conditions used. However, prior to cross-linking we could not compete for azido-ATP binding by addition of a large excess of cold ATP. This shows that azido-ATP and ATP bind to different sites on Hsp90, or that azido-ATP binds with a much higher affinity than normal ATP, or that azido-ATP simply cross-links nonspecifically with Hsp90. Thus the photocross-linking of azido-ATP to Hsp90 cannot be taken as a reliable indicator of ATP binding. This view was reinforced by the finding that BSA (Fig. 3) and Fab fragment (data not shown) photocross-linked to azido-ATP in a manner similar to Hsp90. In contrast, the azido-ATP labeling observed with Hsc70 could be competed with micromolar concentrations of cold ATP.Figure 3:Cross-linking of Hsp90, BSA and Hsc70 with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. 5 μg of Hsp90 (A), 5 μg of BSA (B), or 5 μg Hsc70 (C) were incubated with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the presence of increasing concentrations of non-labeled ATP. Lanes 1-8 represent cross-linking in the presence of 0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 10 mM non-labeled ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since it is known that long-lived reaction intermediates form upon the UV-activation of azido-ATP (Todd et al., 1995), the photocross-linking of azido-ATP with Hsp90 needs to be interpreted with extreme caution.ATP Does Not Stabilize Hsp90Substrate or cofactor binding leads to an often dramatic increase in the stabilization energy of the respective protein. This was shown recently for the chaperone DnaK, where binding of MgATP significantly stabilized the protein as determined by monitoring GdmCl-induced unfolding transitions (Palleros et al., 25.Palleros D.R. Shi L. Reid K.L. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4314-4321Google Scholar). Using this assay system, we analyzed whether the addition of MgATP exhibits similar effects on the stability of Hsp90. In the absence of MgATP an unfolding transition identical to that observed previously (Jakob et al., 1995b) was obtained (Fig. 4). The presence of MgATP did not change the unfolding behavior of Hsp90, indicating that Hsp90 is not stabilized by ATP.Figure 4:Influence of MgATP on GdmCl-induced unfolding of yeast Hsp90. GdmCl-induced unfolding of yeast Hsp90 (50 μg/ml) was performed in the presence (•) or absence (○) of 2 mM ATP in buffer B. To monitor unfolding of yeast Hsp90, the fluorescence signal at 325 nm was recorded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Addition of ATP Does Not Influence the Intrinsic Fluorescence of Hsp90Previously it had been reported that addition of ATP decreases the intrinsic fluorescence of Hsp90 (Csermely et al., 7.Csermely P. Kajtár J. Hollósi M. Jalsovsky G. Holly S. Kahn C.R. Gergely Jr., P. Söti C. Mihály K. Somogyi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1901-1907Google Scholar). We readdressed this question again by comparing Hsp90 with the ATP-binding protein Hsc70 and the non-ATP-binding proteins BSA and Fab fragment concerning changes in the intrinsic fluorescence in the presence of ATP.We found that addition of increasing concentrations of ATP results in a decrease of the intrinsic protein fluorescence independent of the protein used. This is due to the “inner filter effect” of ATP, i.e. the light absorption of ATP leading to a decreased fluorescence emission. It is possible to correct fluorescence spectra recorded in the presence of ATP for this nonspecific effect of the nucleotide, as described by Birdsall et al.(1983). This allows to detect potential specific influences of ATP on the intrinsic fluorescence of proteins. After correction, as shown in Fig. 5, a slight decrease in fluorescence accounting for about 5% of the signal was observed with all proteins studied. Most importantly, however, both Hsp90 and the non-ATP-binding protein Fab gave a constant fluorescence signal at ATP concentrations, ranging from 2 μM to 2.5 mM, while the intrinsic fluorescence of Hsc70 increased by more than 10%, reflecting the specific binding of ATP. In the case of BSA, the amplitude decreased by about 25% upon increasing ATP concentrations, most likely due to unspecific interaction with ATP.Figure 5:Influence of ATP on the intrinsic fluorescence of Hsp90, Hsc70, BSA, and IgG. ATP-induced fluorescence changes of (A) 70 μg/ml bovine Hsc70 (○) and 57 μg/ml BSA (▿), (B) 128 μg/ml yeast Hsp90 (□) and 128 μg/ml IgG (□) in the presence of various concentrations of ATP were monitored at 335 nm (Hsc70), 330 nm (BSA), and 325 nm (Hsp90 and IgG) after incubation for 1 min. The inner filter effect of ATP was calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fluorescence-labeled ADP Does Not Bind to Hsp90Binding of ATP to proteins does not necessarily lead to changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of a protein. Therefore, we performed experiments in which we used fluorescent ADP analogues to monitor binding. Here, specific binding results in a fluorescence change of the label. Increasing amounts of Hsp90 were incubated with a fixed amount of the ligand and the fluorescence emission was recorded. The experiments showed that the fluorescence of a 0.4 μM solution of the nucleotide analogues MABA-ADP and MANT-ADP increases only slightly (by some 3% and 0%, respectively) when up to 0.85 μM Hsp90 was added (Fig. 6). In contrast, control experiments with DnaK (Hsc70 from E. coli) show the fluorescence of MABA-ADP to increase by some 250% when up to 0.8 μM of the ATP-dependent molecular chaperone was added (Fig. 6). This is indicative of a high affinity of DnaK for MABA-ATP. Furthermore, in this case cold ADP could compete for binding of the labeled analogue resulting in a constant fluorescence signal despite increasing MABA-ADP concentrations. The 3% increase in fluorescence emission of MABA-ADP observed in the presence of Hsp90 could not be competed by cold ADP. Similar experiments using the ADP analogue etheno-ADP showed only a minor fluorescence increase upon addition of Hsp90. Again, the small fluorescence change in the presence of Hsp90 could not be competed by cold ADP (data not shown).Figure 6:Binding of labeled ADP analogues to Hsp90 and DnaK. Titration of yeast Hsp90 against 0.4 μM MABA-ADP (○) and 0.4 μM MANT-ADP (•) as well as DnaK titration against 0.4 μM MABA-ADP (□).

We, however, had failed to detect any ATPase activity in highly purified bovine Hsp90 preparations (Wiech et al., 1993). Here, we have reinvestigated the ATPase activity of the yeast Hsp90 preparation, which we had been using for the ATP binding experiments. Using radiolabeled ATP we detected a low ATP hydrolyzing activity (Table 1). This activity was severalfold lower than that of BiP, an endoplasmic member of the Hsc70 family, which possesses a very weak ATPase (Table 1). We calculated that a potent phosphatase or kinase, such as casein kinase II present in levels as low as 0.01% in protein preparations could be responsible for this effect. To test if ATPase activity can be detected in highly purified commercially available proteins, we assayed for ATPase activity in “ultrapure RNase” (Table 1). This preparation was found to contain similar levels of ATPase as our"

Herein, we describe the phospholipid binding properties of C2A domains of multiple synaptotagmins (II-VI). We demonstrate that all synaptotagmins can bind negatively charged phospholipids (phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI)) in a Ca2+-dependent manner, although it was previously reported that synaptotagmins IV and VI do not bind phospholipids. The Ca2+-dependent interaction of the C2A domain of synaptotagmin IV with PS was found to have two components with EC50 values of approximately 5 and 120 μM free Ca2+ and exhibited positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient of approximately 2 for both components). This value is lower than that of the C2A domain of synaptotagmin II (Hill coefficient of approximately 3). All other isoforms bound PS with high affinity (EC50 of 0.3-1 μM free Ca2+; Hill coefficient of 3-3.5). In addition, the C2A domain of synaptotagmin IV cannot bind liposomes consisting of PS (or PI) and phosphatidylcholine, PC (or phosphatidylethanolamine, PE) (1:1, w/w), indicating that the binding to negatively charged phospholipids is inhibited by the presence of PC or PE. In contrast, other isoforms bound all of the liposomes, which include either PS or PI, in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Mutational analysis indicated that this phospholipid composition-dependent Ca2+ binding of synaptotagmin IV results in the substitution of Asp for Ser at position 244. The cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin IV also shows this unique phospholipid binding. However, it binds PS with a positive cooperativity and an affinity similar to those of the C2A domains of other isoforms.

https://openalex.org/W2411477302,"Progressive cerebral deposition of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) is an early and constant feature of Alzheimer's disease. Aβ is derived by proteolysis from the β-amyloid precursor protein. β-Amyloid precursor protein processing and the generation of Aβ have been extensively characterized, but little is known about the mechanisms of degradation of this potentially neurotoxic peptide. We identified and purified a proteolytic activity in culture medium that can degrade secreted Aβ but not larger proteins in the medium. Detection of the activity in conditioned medium required the presence of fetal bovine serum and the passage of the cells with a pancreatic trypsin preparation. Its inhibitor profile showed that the activity was a serine protease other than trypsin or chymotrypsin. The protease occurs as a stable ~700-kDa complex with the inhibitor, α2-macroglobulin (α2M), that retains activity against small substrates such as Aβ. Its NH2-terminal sequence suggests that the protease is previously unidentified. Our results indicate that the Aβ-degrading protease we have detected is a non-trypsin component of a pancreatic trypsin preparation or else derives from a zymogen in serum that is activated by a protease in the latter preparation. Because Aβ-bearing plaques in Alzheimer's disease brain contain both α2M and receptors of α2M-protease complexes, the same or a similar α2M-protease complex could arise in vivo and play a role in Aβ clearance. Progressive cerebral deposition of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) is an early and constant feature of Alzheimer's disease. Aβ is derived by proteolysis from the β-amyloid precursor protein. β-Amyloid precursor protein processing and the generation of Aβ have been extensively characterized, but little is known about the mechanisms of degradation of this potentially neurotoxic peptide. We identified and purified a proteolytic activity in culture medium that can degrade secreted Aβ but not larger proteins in the medium.

Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that Aβ deposition is an early and critical event in AD pathogenesis. First, missense mutations in and around the Aβ region of βAPP are genetically linked to early onset AD in several families (reviewed in (4.Mullan M. Crawford F. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 398-403Google Scholar)). The biochemical effects of these mutations have been modeled in cultured cells and shown to involve increased secretion of Aβ peptides(5.Citron M.

Second, patients with trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome) have enhanced expression of βAPP due to increased gene dosage and gradually develop the typical histopathological lesions of AD(9.Mann D.M.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1989; 10: 397-399Google Scholar). Third, trisomy 21 patients develop immature, non-neuritic Aβ deposits (diffuse plaques) prior to any other histopathological feature of AD(9.Mann D.M.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1989; 10: 397-399Google Scholar, 10.Giaccone G. Tagliavini F. Linoli G. Bouras C. Frigerior L. Frangione B. Bugiani O. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 97: 232-238Google Scholar). Fourth, transgenic mice expressing a mutant βAPP protein develop Aβ deposits, surrounding neuritic and glial dystrophy and synaptic loss resembling those of AD(11.Games D. Adams D. Alessandrini R. Barbour R. Berthelette P. Blackwell C. Carr T. Clemens J. Donaldson T. Gillespie F. Guido T. Hagopian S. Johnson-Wood K. Khan K. Lee M. Leibowitz P. Lieberburg I. Little S. Masliah E. McConlogue L.

Based on these and other observations, it is likely that Aβ deposition plays a role in initiating AD lesions that ultimately lead to neuronal dysfunction and hence dementia. As a result, there is intense interest in finding compounds that down-regulate Aβ production, retard its aggregation into potentially cytotoxic amyloid fibrils, protect cells from Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity, or enhance Aβ clearance from the brain. Although recent research has focused almost entirely on the biosynthetic processing of βAPP and the production and fibrillogenesis of Aβ, the degradation of the peptide is of potentially equal importance in the process leading to progressive amyloid deposition. Because Aβ is a normal product of βAPP metabolism that is present in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma at 10-8 to 10-10M(12.Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Esch F. Lee M. Dovey H. Davis D. Sinha S.

Shaffer L.M. Cai X. McKay D.M. Tintner R. Frangione B. Younkin S.G. Science. 1992; 258: 126-129Google Scholar), there must be mechanisms for its clearance that prevent its accumulation in most individuals until very late in life. During the course of experiments on Aβ-secreting transfected cells, we observed a time-dependent decrease in the amount of Aβ in the conditioned medium. We have determined that the factor principally responsible for the decrease in Aβ in our cultures is a serine protease that degrades Aβ efficiently and is proteolytically active in a stable ~700-kDa complex with the protease inhibitor, α2-macroglobulin (α2M). Detection of this complex in culture medium required the presence of serum and a pancreatic trypsin preparation used to passage the cells. Amino-terminal sequencing of the purified enzyme suggests that it is a previously unidentified endoprotease, not trypsin. Our results indicate that serine protease-α2M complexes can efficiently degrade secreted Aβ peptides under physiological conditions, raising the possibility that the regulation of Aβ levels in brain could involve a similar mechanism. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with βAPP695 cDNA were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, and antibiotics. Monkey kidney COS cells cultured in 10 cm dishes were routinely passaged by adding 3 ml of trypsin (0.25%), and 1 mM EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc., catalog 25200-023), immediately aspirating it off, and then incubating the cells at 37°C for 2-3 min. One fifth of the cells were passaged and cultured in DMEM, 10% FBS medium. Alternatively, sequence-grade trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim) or 50 mM EDTA were used instead of trypsin from Life Technologies, Inc. during the passage of the COS cells. To assess Aβ levels in the cultures, confluent monolayers of βAPP695-transfected CHO cells in 10 cm dishes were preincubated for 30 min in methionine-free medium and labeled for 2 h with 300 μCi of [35S]methionine. After washing, cold medium containing FBS was added and the cells chased for various times. The conditioned media were then precipitated with antibody R1280 (to synthetic Aβ-(1-40) peptide) as described previously(13.Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I. Koo E.H. Schenk D. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 322-325Google Scholar). Protease inhibition assays were carried out by adding different protease inhibitors at the indicated concentrations to the chase media. All inhibitors shown in Table 1 were purchased from Sigma, except that 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Pefabloc) was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, Inc.Tabled 1 Human Aβ-(1-40) peptide was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 430A automated peptide synthesizer. Aβ-(1-42) peptide, amylin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and neuropeptide Y were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Peptides were aliquoted, lyophilized, and then resuspended in reaction buffer before experiments. 125I-Labeled Aβ-(1-40) (specific activity = 7.6 × 1010 cpm/μg) was the kind gift of Dr. John Maggio. Aβ degradation in cultures was quantified by incubating 30 μl of conditioned medium with 125I-labeled Aβ-(1-40) (3.3 × 104 cpm) at 37°C for 4 h. A 20-μl aliquot was electrophoresed on Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gels followed by autoradiography. Alternatively, 5 ml of conditioned medium was incubated with 125I-labeled Aβ-(1-40) (6.6 × 106 cpm), followed by precipitation with R1280 and autoradiography. During purification of the protease (below), Aβ-degrading activity was monitored by incubating 0.5-7 μl of the fractions obtained at each purification step with 7 μg of cold synthetic Aβ-(1-40) in 14 μl of reaction buffer (187 mM NaCl, 0.02 M NaHPO4, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at 37°C for various times. After quenching the reaction with 0.5 volume of glacial acetic acid, the sample was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC, or 5 μl of 0.1% pyronin Y was added before analysis on acid-urea-PAGE gels (see below). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of protease required to degrade 1 μg of Aβ-(1-40) substrate in 1 h at 37°C under the above conditions. Protease inhibition assays were conducted under the same conditions, except in the presence of 0.3 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP). For some experiments, excised gel bands or immunoprecipitates which contained the protease were incubated in 50 μl of the same reaction buffer containing 25 μg of cold Aβ-(1-40) at 37°C for 2 h. After a 10,000 × g spin for 3 min, the supernatants were collected, quenched, and analyzed by acid-urea-PAGE. Acid-urea-PAGE (pH 4.0) was carried out by combining two previous methods(15.Resnick N.M. Maloy W.L. Guy H.R. Zasloff M. Cell. 1991; 66: 541-554Google Scholar, 16.Sweeney P.J. Darker J.G. Neville W.A. Humphries J. Camilleri P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 179-184Google Scholar). Briefly, the running gel solution consisted of a final concentration of 15% (v/v) acrylamide, 6 M urea, 88 mM KOH, 3% (v/v) glacial acetic acid, 5.4% (v/v) TEMED, and 0.375% (v/v) ammonium persulfate. A minigel apparatus was used, and the gels were prerun at 100 V for 1 h and run at 150 V in a buffer containing 0.035 M β-alanine and 52 ml/liter glacial acetic acid (pH 4.0). Gels were stained in 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 50% methanol and destained in deionized H2O. COS cells were cultured in DMEM, 2.5% FBS in 15-cm dishes for 4-5 days. Pooled CM (~1 liter) was filtered through 0.22-μm cellulose acetate and loaded on an Affi-Gel Blue column (Bio-Rad), which had been equilibrated in PBS, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The flow-through medium was assayed for protease activity (above) and then applied to a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in PBS, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After extensive washing with this buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 0.64 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After protease assay, the eluant was precipitated (4 h) with 50% NH4 SO4. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 1.2 M KI, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, centrifuged at 10,000 × gav for 10 min and loaded onto a Bio-Gel A15 200-400-mesh agarose column (2.5 × 100 cm), which had been equilibrated in 0.6 M KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol. The sample was eluted in the latter buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (1.5 ml) were collected and monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm. After assaying protease activity and assessing protein composition by native PAGE, a subset of active fractions was pooled and concentrated on a Centricon 30 (Amicon). The concentrated sample (250 μl) was loaded on a Mono Q column (1 × 5 cm) (Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated in PBS, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the column washed with 10 column volumes of the latter buffer. The column was eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from 10 mM to 1 M NaCl run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Aliquots of fractions (0.5 ml) were assayed for protease activity and for protein composition by PAGE and stored at −70°C. All purification steps were carried out at 4°C, except that the Mono Q-FPLC run was at room temperature. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad assay. [3H]DFP was purchased from DuPont NEN at a specific activity of 6.0 Ci/mmol. 0.25 mCi/ml [3H]DFP (final concentration) were incubated with protein samples at 37°C for 30 min. [3H]DFP-bound proteins were visualized by either native PAGE or Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. The partially purified material (200 μl) obtained after the Q-Sepharose chromatography (above) was overlaid onto a 13-ml 10%-40% (w/w) continuous sucrose gradient in PBS, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and spun for 15 h at 40,000 rpm and 1 × 1012ω2t rad2 s-1 in a Beckman SW40 Ti rotor at 4°C. Fractions (0.6 ml) were collected from the top of the gradient and stored at −70°C until analyzed. Following separation on either 10-20% or 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gels, proteins were transferred to PVDF filters in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol at 0.4 mA for 4 h at 4°C. PVDF sheets were soaked in methanol and rinsed in H2O, after which they were blocked in 5% dry milk resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Blots were incubated with primary antibody (anti-α2 macroglobulin at 1:100 or R1280 at 1:500) in 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1.5 h at room temperature. Thereafter, blots were washed in TBST (3 × 10 min) and incubated for 30 min with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:7500 in 25 mM Tris HCl, pH 9.5, 25 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2. Blots were washed again and developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium phosphatase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). For analyses of substrate specificity, 10 μg of Aβ-(1-42) or Aβ-(1-40) were incubated with 15 units of the purified Aβ-degrading protease in 150 μl of DMEM, 10% FBS at 37°C for 12 h. Aliquots (20 μl) were run on 10-20% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted with R1280. Samples were spotted onto Polybrene-coated glass fiber discs and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 475/900/120 system. Data analysis was done by visual inspection of the resulting amino acid-phenylthiohydantoin HPLC chromatograms. Protease reaction products were acidified with neat trifluoroacetic acid, filtered through 0.2-μm polysulfone filters (Alltech, Deerfield, IL), and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC on a Rainin Instruments (Woburn, MA) system consisting of two UD-XL pumps, dynamic and static mixers, a Rheodyne (Cotati, CA) 7161 injector, a UV-1 variable wavelength detector, an FC-1 fraction collector, and an Apple Macintosh Plus controller running Dynamax software. A trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile gradient was run at 1 ml/min using a 4.6 × 650-mm Rainin Dynamax C18 column, a 4.6 × 15-mm guard column of identical chemistry, and detection at 214 nm. The gradient was 0-70% B for 50 min, then 70-100% B for 10 min. Solvent #x0201C;A” was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in HPLC-grade water (Fisher, Fair Lawn, NJ). Solvent #x0201C;B” was 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in 70% (v/v) acetonitrile (Fisher) in HPLC-grade water. One-ml fractions were collected for protein sequencing or for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a VG TofSpec instrument, as described by the manufacturer. Data represent the masses of the predominant singly protonated molecular ions found in each sample. In cases where both the singly and doubly protonated molecular ions were observed, the final masses are the arithmetic average masses. The mass accuracy of the instrument is typically 0.2%. The isotopically averaged calculated masses were obtained using MacProMass 1.0, kindly provided by Dr. Lee (Beckman Institute, Duarte, CA). During experiments in which Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with βAPP695 cDNA (CHO695) were co-cultured with monkey kidney COS cells, we noticed a marked decrease in the amount of Aβ present in the conditioned medium (CM) compared to that found in CM of the CHO transfectants alone. We therefore cultured CHO695 in the COS CM alone, using a pulse-chase paradigm. Two hr labeling of CHO695 with [35S]Met followed by a 4-h chase in COS CM (versus in just DMEM, 10% FBS) revealed a marked and consistent decrease in the amounts of the CHO695-derived Aβ and p3 peptides, as demonstrated by precipitation of the medium with an Aβ antibody (R1280) followed by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the amount of secreted APPs (precipitated by antibodies specific for this βAPP derivative) changed very little or not at all, and the profile of total labeled proteins in the CM did not change (data not shown). To determine whether the COS CM contained an activity that degraded Aβ or a factor that decreased the expression or amyloidogenic processing of βAPP in the CHO695 cells, we examined the stability of radiolabeled synthetic Aβ (125I-Aβ-(1-40)) in COS CM versus DMEM, 10% FBS by gel autoradiography. The amount of synthetic Aβ declined substantially in the COS CM (Fig. 1B). To detect the products of this apparent Aβ degradation, we used acid-urea-PAGE to analyze unlabeled synthetic Aβ after incubation in COS medium. We observed a doublet of protein products that was not present after incubation in DMEM, 10% FBS alone (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that Aβ underwent proteolytic degradation in COS CM, generating specific peptide products. To characterize the proteolytic activity, we examined the effects of several different protease inhibitors. Using concentrations known to cause maximal inhibition of other relevant proteases(17.Beynon R.J. Salvesen R. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 241-249Google Scholar), the inhibitor profile demonstrated that an Aβdegrading serine protease was present in the medium (Table 1). Both DFP and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Pefabloc) virtually abolished the degradation of secreted Aβ and partially inhibited that of secreted p3 (Fig. 2). Because Pefabloc actually decreased the levels of secreted Aβ in cells cultured in plain DMEM, 10% FCS (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 3), this compound may have an inhibitory effect, either directly or indirectly, on the unidentified proteases that generate Aβ from βAPP, in addition to its inhibition of the Aβ-degrading protease. Two other serine protease inhibitors, elastatin and aprotinin, produced only 10-15% inhibition of Aβ degradation by the COS medium. In further experiments, we observed that the Aβ-degrading activity in CM was highest immediately after the passage of COS cells and decreased with time after passage. Because trypsin, a serine protease, was routinely used to passage the COS cells, we examined the possibility that Aβ degradation by the COS CM was mediated at least in part by the trypsin, although trypsin inhibitors are present in the FBS that was used in all experiments, and only very small amounts of a Life Technologies pancreatic trypsin preparation were applied to detach the cells for passage (see #x0201C;Experimental Procedures”). Aβ-degrading activity in CM was compared in COS cultures that were detached by trypsin purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., sequence-grade trypsin purchased from Boehringer Mannheim or EDTA. As additional controls, the same amount of Life Technologies trypsin as used for cell passage was incubated in plain DMEM, 10% FBS in the absence of COS cells. These various media were assayed for Aβ-degrading activity by the pulse-chase/immunoprecipitation paradigm described above. The CM from COS cells passed using sequence-grade trypsin from Boehringer Mannheim or EDTA showed little or no Aβ-degrading activity in this paradigm, while DMEM, 10% FBS incubated with the trypsin from Life Technologies without the COS cells degraded Aβ (Fig. 3A), indicating that the major Aβ-degrading activity observed under these conditions did not require the presence of COS cells. To determine whether the trypsin itself in the Life Technologies preparation was responsible for the Aβ degradation, TLCK, an inhibitor of trypsin, was included during the chase period. Aβ degradation was not prevented (Fig. 3B). In view of this result and the fact that the more highly purified trypsin preparation from Boehringer Mannheim did not result in Aβ degradation, it was not trypsin per se that degraded Aβ in our assay. To determine whether the degradation was mediated by chymotrypsin, which often copurifies with trypsin, we included TPCK, an inhibitor of chymotrypsin, in the COS chase medium, but again Aβ degradation was not inhibited (Fig. 3B). In addition, purified chymotrypsin was incubated with synthetic Aβ-(1-40) in DMEM, 10% FBS, but a different pattern of Aβ fragmentation was observed on acid-PAGE, and this was inhibitable by TPCK (data not shown). Thus, chymotrypsin is not responsible for the Aβ-degrading activity we describe. To investigate further the origin of the Aβ-degrading activity we detected in CM, we preincubated DMEM with the same small amount of Life Technologies trypsin preparation as used for cell passage at 37°C for 3 days either in the presence or absence of fetal bovine serum and then incubated synthetic Aβ-(1-40) in this solution at 37°C for 16 h and detected products by acid-urea-PAGE. Only the DMEM, 10% FBS incubated with the Life Technologies trypsin gave rise to the pattern of Aβ fragments that we originally detected in COS CM (Fig. 3C), whereas Life Technologies trypsin without FBS hydrolyzed Aβ differently and FBS alone produced no degradation. These results clearly indicated that the Aβ degradating activity detected in COS CM (Fig. 1) required the presence of the Life Technologies pancreatic trypsin preparation and FBS during cell passage. Because these data suggested that an unknown serine protease could efficiently degrade secreted Aβ and p3 but not larger proteins under culture conditions, we purified and further characterized the putative serine protease from ~1 liter of CM of COS cells grown in DMEM, 2.5% FBS and passaged routinely with the Life Technologies trypsin preparation (see #x0201C;Experimental Procedures”). The CM was subjected to sequential fractionation by Affi-Gel Blue chromatography, Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography, ammonium sulfate precipitation, size exclusion chromatography, and a final Mono Q anion exchange column (Table 2). Aβ-degrading activity was monitored at each step by either the pulse-chase method on CHO695 cells (above) or the degradation of cold synthetic Aβ-(1-40) peptide followed by acid-urea-PAGE. 3H-Labeled DFP was incubated with an aliquot from each step to visualize the amount and migration of the serine protease by autoradiography of non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. One unit of enzyme was defined as that which degrades 1 μg of synthetic Aβ-(1-40) in 14 μl of reaction buffer at 37°C in 1 h. The complete protocol enriched the Aβ-degrading activity >40-fold and yielded a fraction containing ~0.4% of the total protein in the starting medium. Gel filtration chromatography (step 4) showed that the protease-containing moiety had a molecular mass of >700 kDa. The purification produced a single Coomassie- and DFP-reactive high molecular weight band in native gels of the final fraction (Fig. 4, A and B). This band was not present in DMEM, 10% FBS (Fig. 4B). In the last two purification steps, minor radiolabeled bands were observed above and below the major DFP-positive band (Fig. 4B, lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that the protease undergoes both limited aggregation and some dissociation during purification (see below).Tabled 1Figure 4:Purification of an active Aβ-degrading protease from conditioned medium of COS cells. A, the Aβ-degrading protease was purified as summarized in Table 2 and #x0201C;Results” and detailed under #x0201C;Experimental Procedures.” Fractions at various purification steps were assessed for enzyme enrichment by native (non-denaturing) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Aliquots from starting CM of COS cells (48 μg, 10.8 units) (lane 1) and a proteolytically active fraction from the final Mono Q column (3.6 μg, 13 units of Aβ-degrading activity) (lane 2) are shown. The position of the presumptive Aβ-degrading protease is indicated. B, aliquots of fractions at various purification steps were assayed for the presence of [3H]DFP-labeled serine protease. After native gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, the proteins present in DMEM, 10% FBS (lane 1), COS CM (COSM, lane 2), an active fraction after Affi-Gel Blue chromatography (AB, lane 3), an active fraction eluted from the Q-Sepharose column (QS, lane 4) and then precipitated with ammonium sulfate (AS, lane 5), pooled active fractions from the Bio-Gel A15 column (BA15, lane 6), and an active fraction from the final Mono Q chromatograph (lane 7) are illustrated. The position of the [3H]DFP-bound Aβ-degrading protease is indicated. The minor [3H]DFP-bound bands shown above and below the substantially enriched Aβ-degrading protease (lanes 6 and 7) are forms apparently derived by aggregation or partial dissociation (see #x0201C;Results”).

Recently, it has been demonstrated that the burst of xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation in the reperfused heart is triggered by a large increase in substrate formation, which occurs secondary to the degradation of adenine nucleotides during ischemia. It is not known, however, whether blocking this substrate formation is sufficient to prevent radical generation and functional injury. Therefore, studies were performed in isolated rat hearts in which xanthine oxidase substrate formation was blocked with the adenosine deaminase inhibitor erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA), and measurements of contractile function and free radical generation were performed. Chromatographic measurements of the intracellular adenine nucleotide pool showed that preischemic administration of EHNA blocked postischemic hypoxanthine, xanthine, and inosine formation. Electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping measurements of free radical generation showed that inhibition of adenosine deaminase with EHNA blocked free radical generation and that it also increased the recovery of contractile function by more than 2-fold. Exogenous infusion of hypoxanthine and xanthine totally reversed the protective effects of EHNA. These results demonstrate that blockade of xanthine oxidase substrate formation by adenosine deaminase inhibition can prevent free radical generation and contractile dysfunction in the postischemic heart.

These results demonstrate that blockade of xanthine oxidase substrate formation by adenosine deaminase inhibition can prevent free radical generation and contractile dysfunction in the postischemic heart. Oxygen free radical generation has been shown to be an important mechanism of cellular injury in ischemic and reperfused tissues(1.Kukreja R.C. Hess M.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1992; 26: 641-655Google Scholar, 2.Simpson P.J. Lucchesi B.R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1987; 110: 13-30Google Scholar). Studies in a variety of tissues including heart, lung, kidney, and brain have demonstrated that intravascular administration of antioxidant enzymes or free radical-scavenging drugs can prevent reperfusion damage and improve postischemic function(3.Cerutti P.A. Fridovich I. McCord J.M. Oxy-radicals in Molecular Biology and Pathology. Alan R. Liss, New York1988: 1-563Google Scholar, 4.Bolli R. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1991; 5: 249-268Google Scholar). These studies have provided indirect evidence of free radical generation in postischemic tissues. More recently, free radical generation has been measured in ischemic tissues with EPR spectroscopy. Both direct and spin trapping EPR techniques have confirmed that there is a burst of oxygen free radical generation in the heart after postischemic reperfusion(5.Zweier J.L. Flaherty J.T. Weisfeldt M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1404-1407Google Scholar, 6.Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1353-1357Google Scholar, 7.Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Williams R. Rayburn B.K.

Although several mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in the generation of oxygen free radicals, xanthine oxidase has been shown to be a central mechanism in a variety of postischemic cells and tissues(9.McCord J.M.

In reperfused tissues, xanthine oxidase in the presence of its substrate hypoxanthine or xanthine reduces molecular oxygen to ·O2- and H2O2, which can further react to form the more reactive ·OH(12.Thompson-Gorman S.L. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6656-6663Google Scholar, 13.Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9880-9884Google Scholar). The ·OH and ·O2- radicals produced by the enzyme can then in turn oxidize cellular proteins and membranes resulting in cellular injury. Over the last decade the therapeutic use of inhibitors of xanthine oxidase has been proposed as an approach to prevent reperfusion injury (15.Opie L.H. Circulation. 1989; 80: 1049-1062Google Scholar). This was based on evidence that xanthine oxidase is a major source of reperfusion-associated free radical generation; therefore, blocking the enzyme would be expected to inhibit radical generation. The importance of this approach was further supported by the hypothesis that in ischemic tissues xanthine dehydrogenase, which reduces NAD to NADH, may be converted via proteolytic cleavage to xanthine oxidase with this increase in xanthine oxidase activity triggering postischemic free radical generation(9.McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Google Scholar, 14.Chambers D.E. Parks D.A. Patterson G. Roy R. McCord J.M. Yoshida S. Parmley L.F. Downey J.M. J. Mol. Cell.

Indeed, xanthine oxidase blockers have been reported to decrease radical generation and prevent postischemic heart injury(12.Thompson-Gorman S.L. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6656-6663Google Scholar, 17.Manning A.S. Coltart D.J. Hearse D.J. Circ. Res. 1984; 55: 545-548Google Scholar, 18.Werns S.W. Shea M.J. Mitsos S.E. Dysko R.C. Fantone J.C.

Yoshida S. Chambers D.E. Eddy L.J. Parmley L.F. Yellon D.M. Downey J.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1985; 19: 686-692Google Scholar). But there was also evidence of possible adverse effects of these drugs, and a number of reports failed to show in vivo efficacy in preventing cell death. It has been reported that both the xanthine oxidase blockers allopurinol and oxypurinol failed to decrease infarction size in in vivo regional models of myocardial necrosis(21.Reimer K.A. Jennings R.B. Circulation. 1985; 71: 1069-1075Google Scholar, 22.Puett D.W. Forman M.B. Cates C.U. Wilson B.H. Hande K.R. Friesinger G.C. Virmani R.

There is also evidence that these drugs may either exert direct dose-dependent toxicity or toxicities due to increased xanthine or hypoxanthine concentrations(12.Thompson-Gorman S.L. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6656-6663Google Scholar). Therefore, there has been a need to look for other alternative ways to prevent free radical-mediated injury. Recently, the kinetics of free radical generation and the relationship of substrate and enzyme control in the mechanism of free radical generation from xanthine oxidase during ischemia and reperfusion have been elucidated in isolated rat hearts(24.Xia Y. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18797-18803Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that the burst of xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation in the reperfused heart is triggered and its time course controlled by a large increase in substrate formation, which occurs secondary to the degradation of ATP during ischemia. Since the availability of xanthine oxidase substrates was shown to be the primary factor that triggers and controls the burst of oxygen free radical generation in the postischemic heart, blocking the formation of these enzyme substrates should inhibit radical generation and prevent radical-mediated myocardial dysfunction. Therefore, studies were performed to determine the effect of adenosine deaminase inhibition on the formation of xanthine oxidase substrates as well as upon free radical generation and free radical-mediated contractile dysfunction. These studies demonstrate that inhibition of xanthine oxidase substrate formation by blockade of adenosine deaminase can greatly decrease free radical generation and contractile dysfunction in the postischemic heart. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) were heparinized and anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital. The hearts were excised, the aorta was cannulated, and retrograde perfusion was initiated. Hearts were perfused at a constant pressure of 80 mm Hg using Krebs bicarbonate buffer consisting of 120 mM NaCl, 17 mM glucose, 25 mM NaHCO3, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA and bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 gas at 37°C as described previously(24.Xia Y. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18797-18803Google Scholar). A sidearm in the perfusion line allowed infusion of different agents according to the experimental purpose. To monitor cardiac contractile function, a latex balloon was inserted through an opening in the left atrium across the mitral valve into the left ventricular cavity and connected to a pressure transducer as described previously(12.Thompson-Gorman S.L. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6656-6663Google Scholar). The balloon was initially inflated with a volume of distilled water sufficient to produce an end diastolic pressure in the range of 8-14 mm Hg. Subsequent measurements of developed pressures were calculated as the difference between the peak systolic and end diastolic pressure. Left ventricular pressure was recorded with a Gould RS3400 four-channel recorder. Coronary flow and heart rates were measured periodically every 5 min prior to ischemia and after 30 min of global ischemia for 45 min of reperfusion. high performance liquid chromatography erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide left ventricular developed pressure rate-pressure production. high performance liquid chromatography erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide left ventricular developed pressure rate-pressure production. After 15 min of perfusion with equilibration of contractile function, hearts were frozen in liquid nitrogen as a preischemic control. For ischemic and reperfusion measurements, hearts were subjected to further 30-min periods of global ischemia or 30 min of ischemia followed by variable duration of reflow. The hearts were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen at the desired time point and then ground under liquid nitrogen. Then the frozen tissue was transferred to a glass homogenizer with a Teflon pastel and allowed to thaw with homogenization in 10 ml of 0.5 M perchloric acid at 4°C. A small amount of homogenate was removed for assay of total protein content by Lowry assay(25.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). Acid extraction continued on ice for 15 min, at which time cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 min. The acid extract was neutralized by mixing with 20 ml of Freon/trioctylamine (4:1) for 30 s. The mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min, and the upper aqueous layer was recovered and passed through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter and then stored at −80°C for analysis. Reversed-phase HPLC was performed using a procedure similar to that of Hull-Ryde et al.(26.Hull-Ryde E.A. Lewis W.R. Veronee C.D. Jowe J. J. Chromatogr. Biomed. Appl. 1986; 377: 165-174Google Scholar) using a Waters μBondapak C18 column and a Waters HPLC system (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) with a model 484 UV detector, two model 510 reciprocating pumps, and Maxima software, as described previously(27.Zweier J.L. Broderick R. Kuppusamy P. Thompson-Gorman S. Lutty G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24156-24162Google Scholar). Studies were performed using the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). The DMPO (>97% pure) was purchased from Aldrich and further purified by double distillation. For the in vitro studies assessing the effects of EHNA as a radical scavenger, 50 mM DMPO was used. Superoxide was generated from 0.05 units/ml of xanthine oxidase and 0.5 mM xanthine in 50 mM phosphate buffer containing 1 mM deferoxamine at pH 7.4, as described previously(13.Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9880-9884Google Scholar). To generate the hydroxyl radical, deferoxamine was excluded and 50 μM Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetate (1:3) was added to facilitate rapid formation of the hydroxyl radical via the iron-mediated Fenton reaction(6.Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1353-1357Google Scholar, 13.Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9880-9884Google Scholar). For studies measuring free radical generation in the isolated heart, DMPO was infused through a sidearm located just proximal to the heart perfusion cannula with a final concentration of 50 mM. Spin trap containing effluent was collected in 20-s aliquots prior to ischemia and at different times of reflow(12.Thompson-Gorman S.L. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6656-6663Google Scholar, 14.Chambers D.E. Parks D.A. Patterson G. Roy R. McCord J.M. Yoshida S. Parmley L.F. Downey J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1985; 17: 145-152Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded in flat cells at room temperature with a Bruker-IBM ER 300 spectrometer operating at X-band with a TM 110 cavity using a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, modulation amplitude of 0.5 G, microwave power of 20 milliwatts, microwave frequency of 9.77 GHz, and acquisition of 10 1-min scans. Quantitation of the free radical signals was performed by comparing the double integral of the observed signal with that of a known concentration of the 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxy free radical in aqueous solution as described previously(6.Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1353-1357Google Scholar, 11.Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Lutty G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4046-4050Google Scholar). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences in the recovery of various physiology parameters among the groups were tested using a repeated measures two-way analysis of variance. Individual comparisons were analyzed by Student's t test for independent means. The values of p < 0.05 were accepted as statistically significant. It is well established that ATP depletion during myocardial ischemia leads to accumulation of the diffusible adenine nucleotides, adenosine and inosine, as well as the nucleopurines, hypoxanthine and xanthine (Fig. 1). In these degradation reactions, a limiting step is conversion of adenosine to inosine catalyzed by adenosine deaminase(28.Jennings R.B. Steenbergen Jr., C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 727-749Google Scholar, 29.Swain J.L. Holmes E.W. Fozzard H.A. Haber E. Jennings R.B. Katz A. Morgan H.E. The Heart and Cardiovascular System. Raven Press, New York1986: 911-929Google Scholar). EHNA has been demonstrated to be an adenosine deaminase blocker with Ki = 1 nM(30.Vargeese C. Sarma M.S. Pragnacharyulu P.V. Abushanab E. Li S.Y. Stoeckler J.D. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 3844-3849Google Scholar, 31.Porter D.J. Abushanab E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8216-8220Google Scholar). Studies were performed to confirm that EHNA administration prior to ischemia effectively blocked adenosine deaminase with decreased formation of hypoxanthine and xanthine. Either untreated or EHNA-pretreated (250 μM infusion for 10 min prior to ischemia) hearts were studied, with 4 hearts in each group. The hearts were subjected to 30-min global ischemia, and reversed-phase HPLC of heart extracts was performed to measure the intracellular adenosine nucleotide pool. As shown in Fig. 2a and reported previously(27.Zweier J.L. Broderick R. Kuppusamy P. Thompson-Gorman S. Lutty G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24156-24162Google Scholar), each of the cellular nucleotides and their metabolites have unique retention times, allowing measurement and quantitation. Myocardial adenine nucleotide levels in EHNA-treated and vehicle control groups before and after ischemia are shown in Figure 2:, Figure 3:. The mean preischemic levels of adenosine nucleotides in EHNA and control groups were similar, with no significant differences observed. At the end of 30-min ischemia, ATP and ADP levels in control hearts markedly dropped to 7.2 ± 0.4 and 4.9 ± 1.1 nmol/mg protein from the preischemic values of 33.4 ± 0.5 and 16.3 ± 0.2 nmol/mg protein (p < 0.01, versus preischemia). While preischemic administration of EHNA resulted in higher mean ATP and ADP levels after ischemia with values of 12.6 ± 2.7 and 9.6 ± 2.4 nmol/mg protein, respectively, due to interexperiment variation these differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.17 and p = 0.09, respectively, for EHNA versus untreated hearts). Myocardial AMP and NAD levels were also not significantly affected by the inhibitor (Fig. 3A).Figure 2:Representative chromatograms of reversed-phase HPLC nucleotide separation. A 10-μm μBondapak C18 column (3.9 × 150 mm) was used with a 20-μl injection. The peaks are labeled as follows: A, uric acid; B, ATP; C, ADP; D, hypoxanthine; E, xanthine; F, AMP; G, inosine; H, NAD; I, adenosine. Panel a shows a chromatogram of a mixture of standards containing a 100 μM concentration of each compound. Chromatograms from extracts of an untreated heart (b) or an EHNA-treated heart (c) (preischemic infusion of 250 μM EHNA) after 30-min ischemia are shown. In the untreated hearts, significant inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine peaks were seen (b). In EHNA-treated hearts, there was a marked decrease in the inosine peak and a large increase in the adenosine peak (c). No significant hypoxanthine or xanthine peaks were observed in the EHNA-treated hearts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3:Effect of EHNA preischemic administration on the adenine nucleotide pool in hearts subjected to 30-min ischemia. As shown, preischemic infusion with 250 μM EHNA significantly blocked the formation of hypoxanthine and xanthine during ischemia. Each bar represents the mean ± S.E. values obtained from measurements of four hearts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Only trace amounts of inosine and adenosine could be detected in preischemic heart. At the end of 30 min of ischemia, the concentration of inosine and adenosine increased to 9.9 ± 0.8 and 8.6 ± 2.6 nmol/mg protein, respectively. In the presence of EHNA, a marked further increase in myocardial adenosine level was observed to a concentration of 17.1 ± 0.8 nmol/mg protein (p < 0.01 versus control hearts). However, the large rise of inosine that occurred in untreated ischemic hearts was dramatically decreased to 2.6 ± 0.2 nmol/mg protein (p < 0.001, versus control) (Figure 2:, Figure 3:B). These data confirmed that adenosine deaminase had been inhibited by the preischemic infusion of EHNA. Inosine can be further degraded by inosine phosphorylase to form the xanthine oxidase substrates hypoxanthine and xanthine. While no hypoxanthine or xanthine was detected in preischemic hearts, after 30 min ischemia significant hypoxanthine and xanthine formation and accumulation occurred with average concentrations of 2.2 ± 0.3 and 2.4 ± 0.2 nmol/mg protein. In EHNA-treated hearts, hypoxanthine and xanthine concentrations were much lower than in untreated hearts with mean concentrations of 0.6 ± 0.3 and 0.5 ± 0.4 nmol/mg protein (p < 0.01). Thus, EHNA infusion was effective at blocking adenosine deaminase within the heart, and it prevented the formation and accumulation of xanthine oxidase substrates, hypoxanthine and xanthine, in postischemic myocardium. Preischemic administration of EHNA significantly reduces the formation and accumulation of radical-generating substrates hypoxanthine and xanthine. In order to determine whether this results in inhibition of free radical generation, experiments were performed comparing radical generation in untreated and EHNA-treated hearts, with three hearts in each group. The coronary effluent containing the spin trap DMPO was collected in 20-s aliquots during both preischemic and postischemic infusion, and EPR measurements were performed. No significant signal was observed prior to ischemia in either untreated control or EHNA-treated hearts. In control hearts, a prominent spectrum was seen immediately after the onset of reflow. As reported previously, this spectrum consisted of a large 1:2:2:1 quartet signal, aH = aN = 14.9 G, indicative of DMPO-OH, and a small 1:1:1:1:1:1 sextet signal, aH = 16.0 and aN = 22.0 G, indicative of DMPO-R (Fig. 4). Maximum signal intensity was observed within the first minute of reflow followed by a gradual decline over the next 5 min. In the presence of EHNA, the amplitude of the observed free radical generation was decreased by more than 80%, compared with that in untreated hearts (Fig. 5).Figure 5:Graph of the effect of EHNA on the time course of free radical generation measured by EPR spin trapping, with 50 mM DMPO. In untreated hearts (circles) a burst of radical generation during the first 2 min of reperfusion was observed and gradually declined over the next 5 min. In EHNA-treated hearts (squares) radical concentrations were significantly decreased.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To evaluate if EHNA in the concentration used could have any direct effects in scavenging free radicals, studies were performed evaluating the effect of 250 μM EHNA on both superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals generated in vitro from xanthine oxidase using the spin trap DMPO, 50 mM. In the presence of xanthine, xanthine oxidase generates superoxide with a prominent DMPO-OOH signal, and EHNA had no effect on the magnitude of this radical generation (Fig. 6, A and B). Similarly in the presence of the iron chelate Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetate, xanthine oxidase and xanthine generate the hydroxyl radical with a prominent DMPO-OH signal, and this radical generation was not altered by EHNA (Fig. 6, C and D). Thus, EHNA had no measurable direct effect as a free radical scavenger, which confirms that the observed decrease in radical generation is due to its effect on decreasing the formation of xanthine oxidase substrates. To determine if adenosine deaminase inhibition prevented postischemic injury and enhanced the recovery of contractile function after reperfusion, a series of 14 hearts were subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by 45 min of reperfusion, and hemodynamic indexes were continuously recorded. 250 μM EHNA or vehicle were infused into the heart prior to ischemia. Preischemic administration of EHNA had no effect on contractile function or coronary flow. However, EHNA-treated hearts had significantly improved contractile performance with higher recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and rate-pressure product (RPP). EHNA-treated hearts exhibited more than 2-fold increased recovery of LVDP and RPP over the entire course of reflow (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8). Average final recovery of LVDP and RPP after 45 min of reperfusion was 48.2 ± 8.4% and 44.6 ± 8.9% in the EHNA group, compared with only 25.0 ± 2.5% and 23.3 ± 3.7% in the untreated controls (p < 0.01). EHNA pretreatment did not significantly alter the recovery of coronary flow upon reperfusion (Fig. 9).Figure 9:Recovery of coronary flow, expressed as a percentage of preischemic values. Data are shown as described in the legend to Fig. 7. EHNA treatment did not alter the observed coronary flow after reperfusion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 8:Recovery of rate pressure product, RPP, in hearts subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by reperfusion. Data are shown as described in the legend to Fig. 7. EHNA significantly improved the recovery of RPP over the entire duration of reflow (p < 0.01), and this was totally reversed by hypoxanthine and xanthine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) While EHNA pretreatment resulted in significant beneficial effects on the recovery of contractile function, with inhibition of the formation of the xanthine oxidase substrates hypoxanthine and xanthine, and decreased free radical generation, it also increased the concentrations of adenosine, and this also might exert protective effects. To further confirm the importance of the decreased formation of radical-generating substrates in the protective action of EHNA, additional experiments were performed to determine whether supplementation of hypoxanthine and xanthine could reverse this protection. As reported previously, the concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine within the heart are approximately 500 μM after 30 min of global ischemia (24.Xia Y. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18797-18803Google Scholar). In a series of seven hearts, hypoxanthine (500 μM) and xanthine (500 μM) were infused into hearts together with EHNA for 10 min followed by subsequent ischemia and reperfusion. This restoration of hypoxanthine and xanthine totally reversed the increased recovery of contractile function in EHNA-treated hearts (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8). In the presence of hypoxanthine and xanthine, the recovery of LVDP and RPP in EHNA-treated hearts after 45-min reperfusion were similar to levels observed in untreated hearts with values of 25.2 ± 5.2% and 18.0 ± 4.7% of preischemic levels. This suggests that the protective action of EHNA was mainly due to the decreased formation of hypoxanthine and xanthine, not the elevation of adenosine. Oxidative reperfusion injury is thought to be a central mechanism of the cellular damage affecting all organs and tissues after ischemia. There is considerable direct and indirect evidence that oxygen free radical generation occurs in the early minutes after reperfusion and results in cellular injury(1.Kukreja R.C. Hess M.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1992; 26: 641-655Google Scholar, 2.Simpson P.J. Lucchesi B.R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1987; 110: 13-30Google Scholar, 3.Cerutti P.A. Fridovich I. McCord J.M.

It has been demonstrated that reactive oxygen species including ·O2-, H2O2, and ·OH are produced at the time of postischemic reperfusion(5.Zweier J.L. Flaherty J.T. Weisfeldt M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1404-1407Google Scholar, 6.Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1353-1357Google Scholar, 7.Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Williams R. Rayburn B.K. Smith D. Weisfeldt M.L.

These oxidants can be cytotoxic to cells by initiating lipid peroxidation of cell membranes and reacting with proteins causing amino acid oxidation and polypeptide chain scission. While several mechanisms have been described for the production of oxygen free radicals in postischemic tissues, xanthine oxidase has been widely accepted as a major primary source of this radical generation(9.McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Google Scholar, 10.Roy R.S. McCord J.M. Greenwald R.A. Cohen G. Oxy Radicals and Their Scavenger Systems. II.

This theory was initially supported by many studies that demonstrated that administration of xanthine oxidase inhibitors reduced the incidence of reperfusion arrhythmias and improved functional recovery(17.Manning A.S. Coltart D.J. Hearse D.J. Circ. Res. 1984; 55: 545-548Google Scholar). More recently, further direct evidence for the presence of xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation in postischemic cells and tissues has been provided by EPR studies that demonstrate that xanthine oxidase inhibition markedly decreases radical generation in both reoxygenated endothelial cells and in the isolated rat heart(12.Thompson-Gorman S.L. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6656-6663Google Scholar, 13.Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9880-9884Google Scholar). While it had been questioned whether this mechanism of radical generation occurs in humans tissues (32.Eddy L.J. Stewart J.R. Jones H.P. Engerson T.D. McCord J.M. Downey J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: H709-H711Google Scholar, 33.Grum C.M. Gallagher K.P. Kirsh M.M. Shlafer M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1989; 21: 263-267Google Scholar), recently it has been demonstrated that xanthine oxidase is present in both human arterial and venous endothelial cells and that under conditions of anoxia and reoxygenation the enzyme gives rise to free radical generation, which can result in cellular injury and death (27.Zweier J.L. Broderick R. Kuppusamy P. Thompson-Gorman S. Lutty G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24156-24162Google Scholar, 34.Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Thompson-Gorman S. Klunk D. Lutty G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C700-C708Google Scholar). In order to develop a rational and effective approach to prevent free radical generation and radical-mediated injury in the postischemic heart, it is necessary to understand the biochemical process that triggers and controls this radical generation. It has been demonstrated that xanthine oxidase is present and is a major source of radical generation in the isolated rat heart(12.Thompson-Gorman S.L. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6656-6663Google Scholar). While this was known for some time, questions remained regarding the magnitude and relative importance of enzyme formation versus substrate formation in triggering the burst of radical generation seen upon reperfusion. It was originally proposed that in ischemic tissues xanthine dehydrogenase undergoes proteolytic cleavage to form the oxidase and that a large proportion of enzyme conversion would trigger the oxidant burst. It was also recognized that substrate formation would concomitantly occur, further supporting this process of radical generation(9.McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Google Scholar). Recently, studies performed in the isolated rat heart demonstrated that xanthine oxidase-mediated radical generation is triggered and controlled primarily by the formation of large concentrations of the substrates xanthine and hypoxanthine due to the breakdown of ATP during myocardial ischemia(24.Xia Y. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18797-18803Google Scholar). While no substrate was detectable prior to ischemia, during ischemia both xanthine and hypoxanthine concentrations increased by over 1000-fold. Prior to ischemia, however, xanthine oxidase was present, but in the absence of its substrates no radical generation was observed. After ischemia only modest 30% increases were seen. Thus, it was demonstrated that the burst of radical generation in the ischemic heart was triggered and controlled primarily by the formation of xanthine and hypoxanthine during ischemia. In principle, either blocking xanthine oxidase or inhibiting the formation of enzyme substrates could have identical effects on radical generation, but the latter strategy would be expected to quench the initiator that triggered the free radical burst. A large number of experiments have been performed to evaluate the effect of xanthine oxidase blockers on reperfusion damage, and variable efficacy has been reported(17.Manning A.S. Coltart D.J. Hearse D.J. Circ. Res. 1984; 55: 545-548Google Scholar, 18.Werns S.W. Shea M.J. Mitsos S.E. Dysko R.C. Fantone J.C. Schork M.A. Abrams G.D. Lucchesi B.R.

Circulation. 1988; 78: 473-480Google Scholar). In contrast, relatively little research has been reported to assess the potential of inhibiting enzyme substrate formation in attenuating oxidative reperfusion injury. Abd-Elfattah and colleagues (35.Abd-Elfattah A.S. Jessen M.E. Lekven J. Doherty N.E. Brunsting L.A. Wechsler A.S. Circulation. 1988; 82, Suppl. III: 224-235Google Scholar, 36.Abd-Elfattah A.S. Jessen M.E. Hanan S.A. Tuchy G. Wechsler A.S. Circulation. 1990; 82, Suppl. IV: 341-350Google Scholar) have noted with in vivo surgical canine models of global ischemia and reflow that pharmacological interventions aimed at decreasing substrate concentrations can decrease the severity of injury. However, the exact mechanism by which this protection occurred was not elucidated. In the present study, we systematically evaluated how blocking substrate formation affected the burst of free radical generation and radical-mediated heart dysfunction. While from prior studies it was clear that radical generation was triggered by xanthine oxidase substrate formation, it was not known if blocking this substrate formation could be effective at preventing free radical generation and free radical-mediated reperfusion injury. To confirm the functional importance of this substrate formation in the pathogenesis of postischemic injury and in an effort to elucidate effective pharmacological approaches to prevent this tissue injury, the present studies were performed evaluating the effects of adenosine deaminase inhibition on xanthine oxidase substrate formation, free radical generation, and functional injury in the isolated rat heart. It was observed that the adenosine deaminase inhibitor EHNA was effective at blocking the formation of the xanthine oxidase substrates xanthine and hypoxanthine. More than 70% block of this substrate formation was seen in the presence of 250 μM EHNA, with no adverse functional effects. EPR spin trapping measurements demonstrated that this inhibition of xanthine oxidase substrate formation was sufficient to decrease radical generation by more than 80%. While radical generation was inhibited in the heart, EHNA had no in vitro efficacy as a scavenger of superoxide or hydroxyl radicals and no measurable effect on xanthine oxidase-mediated radical generation in the presence of added xanthine. Studies of heart contractile function demonstrated that this blockade of xanthine oxidase substrate formation and radical generation resulted in more than a 2-fold increase in the recovery of contractile function upon reperfusion. Therefore, these findings suggest that decreasing the formation of xanthine oxidase substrates by blocking adenosine deaminase can inhibit oxygen free radical generation and prevent myocardial reperfusion injury. Inhibition of adenosine deaminase not only decreased the concentration of hypoxanthine and xanthine, but it also increased the levels of adenosine within the ischemic heart. This elevation of adenosine could have also potentially exerted a protective effect on the heart beyond that which occurs due to prevention of xanthine oxidase-mediated radical generation. It is well known that adenosine is a potent coronary vasodilator, and adenosine-mediated increases in coronary flow could potentially result in enhanced recovery of cardiac function(37.Berne R.M. Circ. Res. 1980; 47: 807-813Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been suggested that adenosine may have an important role in the process of myocardial preconditioning, by which short periods of ischemia protect the heart from subsequent longer periods of ischemia (38.Liu G.S. Thornton J. Van Winkle D.M. Stanley A.W.H. Olsson R.A. Downey J.M. Circulation. 1991; 84: 350-356Google Scholar). In untreated hearts, it was observed that the adenosine concentration after 30 min of ischemia was increased by about 20-fold, while in the presence of EHNA a 40-fold increase was seen. Even though the greater increase in adenosine concentrations in the EHNA-treated hearts could have potentially resulted in increased coronary flow and subsequent protection, no such increase occurred, and the recovery of coronary flow was identical in EHNA and untreated hearts. This suggested that the further increases in adenosine seen with EHNA did not exert significant functional effects on myocardial circulation and function. It is probable that the large increase of adenosine in untreated hearts is more than sufficient to saturate adenosine receptors within the heart. In the EHNA-treated hearts a higher recovery of ATP was also observed, with values of 22% of preischemic values in the untreated hearts (corresponding to an intracellular concentration of 2.0 mM), while values of 36% were measured in the EHNA-treated hearts (intracellular concentration of 3.2 mM). Since it has previously been shown that ATP concentrations of greater than 1 mM are more than sufficient to saturate the myocardial ATPases(39.Zweier J.L. Jacobus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8015-8021Google Scholar, 40.Krause S.M. Jacobus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2480-2486Google Scholar), this change in ATP concentration in itself would not be expected to explain the enhanced recovery of contractile function that was observed with EHNA. In order to further demonstrate that the beneficial effects of adenosine deaminase inhibition were due to the decreased formation of xanthine oxidase substrates, experiments were performed to determine if the EHNA-induced protection could be reversed by hypoxanthine and xanthine. We observed that an exogenous supply of hypoxanthine and xanthine at concentrations equal to those that occur in the absence of EHNA completely reversed the EHNA-induced protection of the postischemic heart. These results confirm that the EHNA-induced protective effects on postischemic heart function were mainly due to decreased formation of xanthine oxidase substrates. Adenosine deaminase blockade is only one of several ways to inhibit the formation and accumulation of hypoxanthine and xanthine in ischemic tissues. As shown in the ATP degradation diagram, interrupting any link in the chain of reactions prior to hypoxanthine formation would limit the production of hypoxanthine and xanthine (Fig. 1). In fact, these enzymatic steps provide multiple possible sites of pharmacological intervention. For instance, it has been reported that blocking adenine nucleotide transport protein with p-nitrobenzylthioinosine significantly reduced the formation of hypoxanthine as well as xanthine and improved postischemic heart function(35.Abd-Elfattah A.S. Jessen M.E. Lekven J. Doherty N.E. Brunsting L.A. Wechsler A.S. Circulation. 1988; 82, Suppl. III: 224-235Google Scholar, 36.Abd-Elfattah A.S. Jessen M.E. Hanan S.A. Tuchy G. Wechsler A.S. Circulation. 1990; 82, Suppl. IV: 341-350Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that inhibition of 5′-nucleotidase exerted protective effects on the postischemic heart and suggested that this protection was related to enhanced ATP resynthesis during reperfusion(41.Bolling S.F. Olsznaski D.A. Bowe E.L. Childs K.F. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 1992; 103: 73-77Google Scholar, 42.Bak M.I. Ingwall J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 40-49Google Scholar). Our observations could provide an alternative explanation for these beneficial effects on postischemic function, since inhibition of 5′-nucleotidase would also be expected to decrease the formation of hypoxanthine and xanthine, which would decrease free radical generation. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the formation and accumulation of xanthine oxidase substrates in ischemic myocardium could be largely inhibited by blocking the degradation of adenine nucleotides using the adenosine deaminase blocker EHNA. Limiting substrate formation greatly decreased free radical generation, which in turn resulted in decreased reperfusion injury with increased recovery of contractile function. Thus, inhibition of adenine nucleotide breakdown was found to be highly effective at preventing xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation and subsequent contractile dysfunction in the postischemic heart."

The primary response of Lactobacillus plantarum to an osmotic upshock involves the accumulation of compatible solutes such as glycine betaine, proline, and glutamate. We have studied the osmotic regulation of glycine betaine transport in L. plantarum by measuring the overall and unidirectional rates of glycine betaine uptake and exit at osmostasis, and under conditions of osmotic upshock and downshock. At steady state conditions, a basal flux of glycine betaine (but no net uptake or efflux) is observed that amounts to about 20% of the rate of “activated” uptake (uptake at high osmolarity). No direct exchange of 14C-labeled glycine betaine in the medium for unlabeled glycine betaine in the cytoplasm was observed in glucose metabolizing and resting cells, indicating that a separate glycine betaine efflux system is responsible for the exit of glycine betaine. Upon osmotic upshock, the uptake system for glycine betaine is rapidly activated (within seconds), whereas the basal efflux is inhibited. These two responses account for a rapid accumulation of glycine betaine until osmostasis is reached. Upon osmotic downshock, glycine betaine is rapidly released by the cells in a process that has two kinetic components, i.e. one with a half-life of less than 2 s which is unaffected by the metabolic status of the cells, the other with a half-life of 4-5 min in glucose-metabolizing cells which is dependent on internal pH or a related parameter. We speculate that the former activity corresponds to a stretch-activated channel, whereas the latter may be facilitated by a carrier protein. Glycine betaine uptake is strongly inhibited immediately after an osmotic downshock, but slowly recovers in time.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model organism to investigate the biology of the eukaryotic cell. The yeast genome is compact (13.5 megabases) and contains only 6000-7000 genes. More than 1000 of them have been characterized by traditional techniques. The systematic genome sequencing initiated by the European Community is progressing rapidly and should soon be completed. The most striking observation derived from sequencing data is that nearly 40% of putative proteins deduced from gene sequence are novel, without homology to previously known proteins, and thus without predicted functions. Moreover, the majority of these novel genes are non-essential. In this context, the functional analysis of the yeast genome is a real challenge for the coming years. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Google Scholar) is a powerful tool to undertake functional studies relevant to the yeast genome. More than 1500 soluble proteins of yeast are detectable and well separated on two-dimensional gels. This technique offers the opportunity to detect alterations in protein synthesis, protein modifications, and protein degradation occurring in response to environmental or genetic changes. However, the two-dimensional gel approach suffers from the low number of proteins which are identified on the yeast protein map. Up to now, less than 80 spots have been unambiguously characterized(2.Ludwig J.R.D. Foy J.J. Elliott S.G. McLaughlin C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 117-126Google Scholar, 3.Bataille N.

Slonimski P. Perrot M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 601-613Google Scholar). Identification of large numbers of protein spots by either method is a daunting task. Other methods have been proposed based on the measure of pI, Mr, and a third structural parameter allowing the search of the corresponding protein in data bases.

Biol. 1993; 3: 327-332Google Scholar) have been used as third parameter. Although these methods remain predictive, they are sensitive and useful as an integrated approach to protein identification. This paper describes the simple and rapid amino acid analysis of 200 yeast proteins by the selective incorporation of several pairs of 3H- and 14C-labeled amino acids. Seventy nine new protein spots were identified based on their Mr, pI, and amino acids ratios, which doubles the number of yeast proteins presently identified on two-dimensional gels. Identified proteins belong to few functional families. We noted that cytosolic and organellar proteins of similar abundance have a markedly different codon bias. This study was performed with strain S288C (Matα SUC2 mal mel gal2 CUP1; (14.Mortimer R.K. Johnston J.R. Genetics. 1986; 113: 35-43Google Scholar)), which is the reference strain for genome sequencing. Cells were grown and labeled at 30°C in 2.5 ml of medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base minus amino acids (Difco), 2% glucose and buffered at pH 5.8 with 1% succinate and 0.6% NaOH. A mid log preculture was diluted to about 0.3 A600/ml and labeled for 4-5 h to reach 0.7-0.8 A600/ml. For remetabolization studies, cells were labeled with 200 μCi of one of the 15 following 14C amino acids: Gly (final concentration 1 mM), Ala and Ser (0.53 mM), Asp, Glu, Thr, and Pro (0.4 mM), Leu, Ile, Val, His, Lys, and Arg (0.3 mM), Tyr and Phe (0.2 mM). For double labeling, 0.75-1 mCi of L-[4,5-3H]leucine was added with one of the following L-U-14C-labeled amino acids: Ile, Tyr, Phe (200 μCi), Arg, His, Lys (400 μCi), or a 35S-labeled amino acid Cys or Met (400 μCi). To avoid conversion of methionine to cysteine, 1 mM unlabeled cysteine was added to the culture medium. In one case, leucine was supplied as 14C-labeled amino acid (60 μCi) with L-[5-3H]tryptophan (1 mM). 35S- and 3H-labeled amino acids were purchased from Amersham Corp. U-14C-labeled amino acids were produced and purified in our laboratory. All isotopes were of the highest available specific activity. After labeling, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with 200 μl of H2O, and frozen as a pellet at −180°C. To avoid problems of radiolysis, the cell pellet should be analyzed within 1 month. Frozen cells were resuspended in 200 μl of H2O and disrupted by shaking in the presence of 50 mg of glass beads (0.45 mm) on a Mini BeadBeater (Biospec products). The tubes were agitated twice for 30 s at 30-s intervals and left on ice between shakings. Cells were then centrifuged, and proteins were precipitated twice with trichloroacetic acid. The proteins were then hydrolyzed at 100°C for 12 h in 6 M HCl. After evaporation of HCl, samples were applied to HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonateTEMEDN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamineCBIcodon bias index. column (Adsorbosphere OPA HS 5 μm, 100 × 4.6 mm; Alltech) equipped for o-phthaldialdehyde derivatization essentially as described by Godel et al.(15.Godel H. Graser T. Foldi P. Pfander P. Furst P. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 297: 49-61Google Scholar). The postcolumn radioactive detection was obtained after fractionation in 0.5-ml sample (three fractions/min) by scintillation counting of each fraction. Alternatively, samples were applied on cellulose thin layer chromatography in two different solvent systems (butanol-1/acetic acid/water (90/15/33) and isoamylalcohol/acetic acid/pyridine/water (20/5/40/20)), and radiolabeled amino acids were quantified by phosphor technology (Phosphor-Imager, Molecular Dynamics). Similar results were obtained by both methods. high performance liquid chromatography 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine codon bias index. Frozen cells were disrupted with glass beads (see above) in 20 μl of a solution containing 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mM CaCl2, 50 mM MgCl2, RNase A (50 units/ml), and DNase I (500 units/ml). After 10 min on ice, 20 μl of lysis buffer (0.1% SDS; 4% Ampholines 3-10) were added. After 5 s vortexing, 50 mg of urea and 20 μl of a sample buffer (4.75 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 1% Ampholines 3-10, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) were added. Protein samples were then kept for 10 min at room temperature, gently vortexed, and centrifuged for 4 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was stored at −80°C. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was a modification of the procedure of O'Farrell(1.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Google Scholar). It was performed on a Millipore Investigator apparatus used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were separated in the first dimension by isoelectric focusing in gels containing 4% acrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio: 37.5 (w/v)), 9.5 M urea, 3.6% CHAPS, and 3.75% carrier ampholytes (25% Ampholines 3-10, 75% Ampholines 4-8). Gels were polymerized for 2 h by addition of 0.03% ammonium persulfate (w/v) and 0.03% TEMED (v/v). Gel tubes were 22 cm long and 1 mm inside diameter. 10-20-μl sample containing 150-250 μg of proteins were directly applied to the gel, without overlay buffer. Gels were run at room temperature for 17 h at 1000 V, then for 30 min at 2000 V. Anode and cathode solutions were 0.08 M phosphoric acid and 0.1 M NaOH, respectively. After focusing, the gel was extruded with a syringe as recommended by the manufacturer and equilibrated 1 min in a buffer containing 0.375 M Tris, pH 9.2, 3% SDS, and 0.01% bromphenol blue. Gels were stored at −20°C until use or immediately loaded. First dimension gels were reequilibrated 1 min before loading on the second dimension slab gel. The slab gels were 23 cm long, 21 cm high, and 1 mm thick and contained 12.5% acrylamide (A/B: 37.5 (w/v)) and 0.38 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. Electrophoresis was performed at 13-15°C at 17 watts/gel for 5 h 30 min. Electrophoresis buffer was 25 mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine, and 0.2% SDS. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, dried, and processed for autoradiography by standard procedures. The spots were numbered on autoradiographic film. Round sections (2.3 mm diameter) of dried gels were punched out at the location of each protein using a sharpened cannula. Most spots were stained enough to be visible on the gel. Other gel pieces were extracted using the autoradiographic film as tracing paper. After extraction, the gel was autoradiographed again to check the precision of spot excision. The spots were placed in plastic scintillation counting vials, rehydrated with 50 μl of H2O, and digested for 3 h at 40°C in 1 ml of NCS (nuclear Chicago solubilizer, Amersham). After addition of 4 ml of BCS-NA (biodegradable counting scintillant, non-aqueous; Amersham), the samples were maintained from 7 to 10 days at room temperature in the dark for stabilization before counting. Radioactivity was measured with a LKB-Pharmacia 1211 mini β counter using 3H and 14C channels that minimize reinjections. Background was determined as the average of 10-20 control samples. Depending on gels, it ranged from 150 to 300 cpm for 3H and from 50 to 100 cpm for 14C. 14C/3H ratios were calculated by the double reinjection method using the internal standard method(16.Simonnet G. Slater R.J. Radioisotopes in Biology. IRL Press, Oxford, New York1990: 31-85Google Scholar). 14C or 35S spill into 3H window was 11-13%, and the 3H spill into the 14C window was 1-2%. The average 14C/3H ratio ranged from 0.12 to 0.5, depending on the double labeling experiments. Each sample was counted for 15 min. When the counting was less than 1000 cpm in 3H or less than 400 cpm in 14C, the measure was not taken into account. This detection limit corresponds to about 0.1 μg of protein. The His/Leu and Cys/Leu ratios of each protein were determined from duplicate experiments. The other double labelings were not duplicated. The isoelectric point and molecular weight were deduced from protein migration as described previously(5.Boucherie H. Dujardin G. Kermorgant M. Monribot C. Slonimski P. Perrot M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 601-613Google Scholar). The location of previously identified protein spots in the first dimension was plotted as a function of the calculated pI values of the corresponding polypeptides. In the same way, the location of each reference protein spot in the second dimension was plotted as a function of log of the calculated values of their Mr. In each case, the regression curve was drawn. Mr and pI of each analyzed polypeptide spot were then determined using the standard curves. The uncertainty in predicting protein parameters from gel migration according to this procedure was shown to be less than 0.2 pH units for pI and less than 15% for Mr(5.Boucherie H. Dujardin G. Kermorgant M. Monribot C. Slonimski P. Perrot M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 601-613Google Scholar). A yeast protein data base containing 1700 sequences was constructed. It contains all the sequences of the yeast protein data base of Garrels (Release 3, 1995) with CBI higher than 0.1. The proteins of lower CBI are supposed to be weakly expressed (17.Bennetzen J.L. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3026-3031Google Scholar) and absent from the 200 most abundant proteins of yeast. For each protein of the data base, the isoelectric point (pI), the molecular weight (Mr), and the amino acid ratios (rA) were calculated, taking into account known post-translational modifications (N- or C-terminal cleavage and N-acetylation). The analysis of a polypeptide (m) consists in calculating a distance between the polypeptide and each protein (x) of the data base. This distance is the addition of a distance in isoelectric point (dI), a distance in molecular mass (dM), and 6-9 distances in amino acid composition (dA): d(x) = dI(x) + dM(x) + σ (dA(x)), where dI(x) = 0, if ∣pI(m) - pI(x)∣ < 0.2; dI(x) = ∣pI(m) - pI(x)∣ - 0.2, if ∣pI(m) - pI(x)∣ > 0.2; dM(x) = 0, if ∣1 - Mr(x)/Mr(m)∣ < 0.15; dM(x) = ∣1 - Mr(x)/Mr(m)∣ - 0.15, if ∣1 - Mr(x)/Mr(m)∣ > 0.15; dA(x) = ∣1 - rA(x)/rA(m)∣, if rA(m) > 0.15; dA(x) = ∣rA(m) - rA(x)∣/0.15, if rA(m) < 0.15. The six proteins having the smallest distance were selected. The best candidate corresponded to the lowest distance (d1) and the five next candidates corresponded to the distances d2 to d6. A limit distance (dL) was chosen as the sum of standard deviations of amino acid ratios. For example, for nine amino acid ratios, dL = 0.06 (Ile/Leu) + 0.08 (Phe/Leu) + 0.14 (His/Leu) + 0.15 (Arg/Leu) + 0.15 (Lys/Leu) + 0.17 (Tyr/Leu) + 0.19 (Trp/Leu) + 0.20 (Met/Leu) + 0.21 (Cys/Leu) = 1.35. If d1 < dL, the best candidate was considered as identified. If d1 > dL, we considered that the data were not accurate enough or that the protein was not in the data base. Our approach to protein identification was based on the determination of the Mr, pI, and amino acid ratios of the analyzed spots. Experimental Mr and pI were measured using standard curves obtained with previously identified proteins (see “Materials and Methods”). The determination of amino acid ratios relies on the incorporation of pairs of 3H- and 14C-labeled amino acids in the proteins and quantification of both radioisotopes for each spot analyzed. A prerequisite to this approach is that the labeled amino acids should not be interconverted into other amino acids during the in vivo labeling period. Such information not being available in the literature, we examined the interconversion of 15 labeled amino acids under our experimental conditions. Yeast cells were labeled with one 14C-labeled amino acid, and proteins were extracted, hydrolyzed, and analyzed for labeled amino acids (see “Materials and Methods”). The results are reported in Fig. 1 and Table 1. Among the 15 amino acids tested, only 7, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Phe, Pro, and Tyr, were specifically incorporated into proteins without detectable interconversion. Arg was weakly metabolized to Pro. The other amino acids (Ala, Asp, Glu, Gly, Ser, Thr, Val) were converted in high proportion into other amino acids. However, we found that these metabolic interconversions could be greatly limited by adding an excess of the nonradioactive amino acid by-product in the medium (Table 1). For example, the presence of 1 mM unlabeled Leu in the culture medium blocked the interconversion of [14C]Val to [14C]Leu. Similarly, interconversions of Ala, Glu, and Thr into other amino acids were considerably reduced by addition of adequate non-radioactive amino acids.Tabled 1 We have no direct information about the interconversion of Asn, Gln, Cys, Met, and Trp, due to the degradation of these amino acids during acid hydrolysis. However, protein labeling with 3H-Trp or 35S-Cys indicated a poor interconversion of these amino acids, as inferred from the very low labeled intensity of reference proteins known to be devoid of Trp (SOD1, HSP60, TIF1) or Cys (SSC1, PGI1). In contrast, labeling with [35S]Met revealed a notable conversion of Met to Cys, since the only reference protein devoid of Met (TPI1) was labeled. However, this interconversion disappeared when 1 mM Cys was added to the culture medium. Altogether, these results indicate that 14 amino acids can be used for in vivo labeling of proteins under conditions yielding only a minimum amount of interconversion (less than 15%). Amino acids chosen for protein labeling must also be discriminant: less frequent amino acids have variable distribution among proteins and are likely to give the most useful information. The amino acids must also label proteins with high efficiency. For example utilization of [14C]Pro was avoided because the proline transport system is strongly repressed under our culture conditions(18.Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 135-139Google Scholar). In the same line, labelings with Ala, Val, or Thr were not performed because they required the addition of other amino acids in excess which limits the transport of the marker and the labeling efficiency. Taking into account these additional criteria, 10 amino acids were chosen for the present study: Trp, Cys, Met, His, Arg, Tyr, Phe, Lys, Ile, and Leu. Since no major difference in interconversions was observed between short or long term labeling (Table 1), we chose a labeling period of 5 h to obtain high levels of incorporation. The choice of a double labeling method using one amino acid labeled with 3H and the other with 14C or 35S, avoids the comparison of different two-dimensional gels and thus, artifacts due to differences in cell culture, protein extraction, proteolysis, gel electrophoresis, and quantification and therefore circumvents the problem of internal controls for protein recovery. Practically, after double labeling, total yeast proteins were extracted and separated on two-dimensional gels. The 200 most abundant proteins were numbered and individual spots were excised and counted for 3H and 14C or 35S radioactivity under carefully controlled conditions. Among these proteins, the identity and the sequence of 45 protein spots were already unambiguously identified by microsequencing or overexpression methods (Table 2). These reference proteins were used as internal standards. For each double labeling, the experimental isotope ratios of the reference proteins were plotted against their known amino acid ratios (Fig. 2). In each case, the experimental values were in good agreement with the theoretical amino acid ratios.Tabled 1Figure 2:Measured 14C/3H ratio or 35S/3H ratio as a function of theorical amino acid ratios for reference proteins. The lines were drawn to minimize the average error. The standard deviations were 6% for Ile/Leu, 15% for His/Leu, 15% for Lys/Leu, 19% for Trp/Leu, 45% for the first Met/Leu labeling and 21% for the second Met/Leu experiment supplemented with 1 mM Cys.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two Met/Leu labelings were carried out with or without unlabeled Cys in the culture medium (Fig. 2). With added Cys, the average error decreased from 30 to 18% and the standard deviation from 45 to 21%. Therefore, the error observed was largely due to the interconversion of labeled Met to labeled Cys. The curves minimizing the average error of these 45 reference proteins for each amino acid ratio are shown in Fig. 2. These calibration curves were used to determine the amino acid ratios for the other 155 proteins analyzed. A yeast protein data base containing 1700 protein sequences of CBI > 0.1 was constructed and a computer program was designed to search the data base for proteins that match experimental parameters, Mr, pI, and amino acid ratios. A distance was calculated (defined under “Materials and Methods”) between the query protein and each protein of the data base. The best candidate had the lowest distance (d1). The best candidate was considered as identified if d1 < dL (dL being a limit distance as defined under “Materials and Methods”). If d1 > dL, we considered that the data were not accurate enough or that the protein was not in the data base. Using the experimental pI, Mr, and amino acid ratios of the 45 reference proteins, we tested the reliability of the search in the data base. The results are reported in Table 2. The correct protein or a closely homologous one (more than 90% identity) obtained the best score in 44 of 45 cases. The correct identification (d1 < dL) occurred in 37 cases. In three cases, the identified protein was a very homologous one. In four cases, no protein was identified (d1 > dL), but the correct protein ranked first each time. In only one case, an incorrect protein was identified (PDC1 in the place of ZWF1 which came third with a score of 1.37). An identification was proposed in 90% of the searches (41 of 45 cases). It was interesting that the second, third, and next best scores, d2, d3, etc., were generally similar and markedly higher than d1. Moreover d2 was higher than dL in 40 of 45 cases, indicating that the dL value was well chosen. d2 represents the statistical best score when the right protein is absent from the data base. Consequently, in almost all cases, if the sequence of the correct protein or a very homologous one was not in the data base, no protein would be identified. In numerous cases, the search distinguished correctly between proteins of the same family. Correct identifications were found even between proteins having more than 90% sequence identity like PDC1/PDC5, ENO1/ENO2, ADH1/ADH2, TDH2/TDH3, TIF51A/ANB1, SSA1/SSA2, SSB1/SSB2. Only three errors were observed: HSP82 was identified in the place of the very homologous protein HSC82 and SSB2 in the place of the two isoforms of SSC1. In these three cases, the correct protein ranked second with a very close score. The identification method was applied to 155 unknown protein spots. 69 new identifications were obtained (Table 3 and Fig. 3) and 10 proteins already predicted by Garrels et al.(4.Garrels J.I. Futcher B. Kobayashi R. Latter G.I. Schwender B. Volpe T. Warner J.R. McLaughlin C.S. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 1466-1486Google Scholar) were confirmed. Among the proteins identified, six proteins were identical to some reference protein (ADH1, ENO2, FBA1, PDC1, TDH3, TPI1), and five proteins were predicted twice (ADE3, SHMT2, TKL1, TRG1, and TSA1). Taking into account these isoforms, the new identifications concern 66 different proteins. Interestingly, we identified 13 proteins only known as putative open reading frames. Seven of them were of unknown function having no homology with any known protein and the six others were similar to proteins of mammals or other organisms.Tabled 1Figure 3:Yeast protein two-dimensional map with names of identified proteins (listed in Table 2 and Table 3). Strain S288C was grown on glucose as carbon source and labeled with [35S]Met at mid log phase. 4 × 106 cpm of protein extract were loaded on the first dimensional gel. The gel was exposed 2 days for autoradiography. Reference proteins are in bold characters and newly identified proteins are in standard characters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Some of the proposed identifications were confirmed by independent experiments: as expected, spots identified as KAR2 and UBC4 (heat shock proteins) were induced by heat shock. Spots proposed as PDB1, ILV2, ILV5, MDH1, SOD2, ATP2, and COR1 known to be mitochondrial proteins were enriched in mitochondrial extracts (data not shown). The intensity of LEU1, LYS9, MET25, and CYS3 spots decreased when, respectively, leucine, lysine, and cysteine were added in the culture medium (data not shown). These observations underscored the reliability of the predictions. A total of 104 gene products were identified in this work. These proteins could be classified in different functional families: glycolysis or carbon metabolism enzymes (19 proteins), amino acid and purine biosynthesis enzymes (24 proteins), 13 heat shock proteins, 10 translation factors and ribosomal proteins, 6 proteolytic enzymes, 4 ATPase subunits, 4 structural proteins, 3 antioxidant enzymes, and a few other classes. The majority of the identified proteins of known localization were cytosolic (57 among 79), but we found also 10 mitochondrial proteins (ATP2, COR1, HSP60, ILV2, ILV5, MDH1, MRP8, PDB1, SOD2, SSC1), 6 nuclear (EGD1, GSP1, HSP104, PRS4, PRS5, UBA1), 4 vacuolar (APE1, PEP4, VMA1, VMA2), 4 proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (CDC48, KAR2, SAR1, TRG1), and 1 vesicular protein (CLC1). The 104 identified proteins are among the most abundant proteins of yeast. The large majority of these proteins (93) had a CBI higher than 0.35 and the correlation observed by Bennetzen and Hall (17.Bennetzen J.L. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3026-3031Google Scholar) between CBI and protein abundance was largely confirmed (Fig. 4). However, we identified 11 abundant proteins whose gene CBI was lower than 0.25 (APE1, CLC1, MRP8, PRS4, PRS5, RBK1, UBA1, ZWF1, L80003.20, YEL071W, and YKL117W). We noticed that among them, the six proteins of known localization were totally or partially localized in a subcellular compartment. Conversely, considering proteins of similar abundance (Fig. 4), the average CBI of cytosolic proteins was 0.68, whereas the average CBI of the 25 identified proteins known to be localized in organelles was significantly lower (0.43). In this work, we have identified 120 spots on two-dimensional gels of yeast proteins, including 69 new identifications and 13 proteins homologous to mammalian proteins or corresponding to open reading frames with unknown functions. The identification method relies on the screen in a yeast protein data base of the proteins matching the experimental data of Mr, pI, and amino acid ratios of the analyzed spots. The method, tested with 45 reference proteins, allowed 41 precise identifications with only one incorrect prediction. The high reliability of this identification method depended on accurate amino acid analysis. The prerequisite to the double labeling technique used here was the evaluation of the extent of amino acid interconversions in yeast. This essential information was not available in the literature. We showed that Leu, Ile, Phe, Tyr, Pro, Lys, and His were not metabolized before incorporation into protein and could be used in double labeling experiments. The 7 other amino acids tested (Gly, Val, Ala, Glu, Asp, Thr, and Ser) were converted in high proportions. The amino acid products observed were always in accordance with the amino acid biosynthetic pathways known in yeast(19.Jones E.W. Fink G.R. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R.

A rapid loss of responsiveness also occurs following receptor activation by agonist ligand binding in this receptor superfamily. This process is called “homologous desensitization.” The mechanisms of homologous desensitization have been extensively studied at the molecular level in rhodopsin and adrenergic receptors (2.Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Google Scholar, 3.Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Google Scholar, 4.Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Google Scholar). Newly discovered G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and arrestins are involved in this process. GRKs specifically recognize and phosphorylate the agonist-bound form of receptors in the active conformation. Subsequently, arrestin proteins bind exclusively to the phosphorylated and activated receptor, resulting in uncoupling of the receptor and G protein. guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein G protein-coupled receptor kinase adrenergic receptor kinase thyrotropin reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction Bluescript base pairs; wt wild type. Six different types of GRKs have so far been cloned and characterized. cDNA for bovine β-adrenergic receptor kinase (β-ARK, now also called GRK2) was first isolated(5.Benovic J.L. DeBlasi A. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1989; 246: 235-240Google Scholar), followed by the cloning of cDNAs for bovine β-ARK2 (GRK3)(6.Benovic J.L. Onorato J.J. Arriza J.L. Stone W.C. Lohse M.

Onorato J.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8715-8719Google Scholar), human IT11 (GRK4)(8.Ambrose C. James M. Barnes G. Lin C. Bates G. Altherr M. Duyao M. Groot N. Church D. Wasmuth J.J. Lehrach H. Housman D. Buckler A. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Human Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 697-703Google Scholar), human GRK5(9.Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5588-5592Google Scholar), and human GRK6(10.Benovic J.L. Gomez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19521-19527Google Scholar, 11.Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9398-9402Google Scholar). Drosophila kinases GPRK-1 and −2 have also been identified(12.Cassill J.A. Whitney M. Joazeiro C.A.P. Becker A. Zuker C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11067-11070Google Scholar). These GRKs can be divided into 3 different subgroups according to their homology, cellular localization, and distinct regulatory mechanisms(9.Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5588-5592Google Scholar, 10.Benovic J.L. Gomez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19521-19527Google Scholar). The first subgroup includes GRK4 to 6 and GPRK-1, the second subgroup GRK1, GRK2, and GPRK-2, and the third subgroup GRK1. GRKs also seem to have different patterns of expression in tissues. GRK1 and GRK4, for instance, are primarily expressed in retinal cells and the testis, respectively, suggesting very specific functions. GRK1 (rhodopsin kinase) phosphorylates photolyzed rhodopsin (7.Lorenz W. Inglese J. Palczewski K. Onorato J.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8715-8719Google Scholar). Although little is at present known about substrate specificity, the testis-specific expression of GRK4 implies that it might be a kinase for gonad-specific G protein-coupled receptors such as the lutropin and follitropin receptors(3.Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Google Scholar). Whereas, other GRKs are expressed in many tissues, suggesting their broad roles in regulating many receptors. The receptor for thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH), that regulates thyroid growth and differentiated functions, is also a member of G protein-coupled receptors (13.Nagayama Y. Kaufman K.D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1184-1190Google Scholar) and well known to undergo homologous, but not heterologous, desensitization(14.Rapoport B. Adams R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6653-6661Google Scholar, 15.Kaneko Y. Horm. Metab. Res. 1976; 8: 202-206Google Scholar, 16.Shuman S.J. Zor U. Chayoth R. Field J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 57: 1132-1141Google Scholar). Although we have recently reported that only the hormone-occupied form of the TSH receptor, like the β-adrenergic receptor, is likely to be involved in homologous desensitization(17.Nagayama Y. Chazenbalk G.D. Takeshita A. Kimura H. Ashizawa K. Yokoyama N. Rapoport B. Nagataki S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1060-1065Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms of TSH receptor desensitization remain largely unclear. The aim of the present studies was, therefore, to characterize the GRK(s) that may play a role in TSH receptor homologous desensitization in the thyroid. Using reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), human and rat thyroid mRNA was studied to determine which types of GRK are present in these cells and whether these include any novel thyroid-specific GRK. We report herein that GRK5 appears to be the predominant GRK isoform in the thyroid cells. Furthermore, we have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of rat GRK5 cDNA of thyroid origin and provide evidence to support the functional role of GRK5 in homologous desensitization of the TSH receptor. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized corresponding to two highly conserved stretches of the catalytic domain of human GRKs: MNGGDL(K/F)(F/Y)H (5′-CAG AAT TCT GAA (C/T)GG IGG IGA (C/T(C/T)T IAA (A/G)TT (C/T)CA-3′, sense) and T(V/H)GYMAPEV (5′-AGG TCG AC(C/T) TCI GGI GCC AT(A/G) TAI CCI ACI GT-3′, antisense), where the italics are the restriction enzyme sites for EcoRI and SalI. Total RNA was extracted from a human thyroid tissue, obtained at the time of subtotal thyroidectomy from a patient with Graves' disease, by the method of Han et al.(18.Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Google Scholar) and from rat FRTL5 cells cultured in the presence of TSH by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method(19.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). FRTL5 cells, normal differentiated rat thyroid epithelial cell line (20.Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Parks L.A.M. Coon H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3455-3459Google Scholar), were cultured in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and the addition of three hormones: 2 units/liter bovine TSH, 5 units/liter insulin, and 5 mg/liter transferrin (3H-medium). Somatostatin, hydrocortisone, and glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine acetate were omitted. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and random primers, a fraction of which was then amplified using 25 pmol of each primer, 200 μmol/liter of each dNTP, and 2 units of Taq polymerase in 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mmol/liter KCl, 1.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, in a final volume of 50 μl. Thirty cycles of denaturation (94°C for 90 s), annealing (45 C for 90 s), and extension (72° C for 60 s) were conducted with an automated thermal cycler. All reactions were initiated with 5 min incubation for 95° C and terminated with 7 min incubation at 72° C. The approximately 300-base pair (bp) products were gel-purified, digested with SalI and EcoRI, and subcloned into SalI and EcoRI digested plasmid Bluescript (pBS) II (Stratagene). Clones were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination methods (21.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) with a modified bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham) and T3 and T7 primers. Polyadenylated RNA was isolated from FRTL5 cells cultured in the presence of TSH by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method, followed by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. Double stranded cDNA was synthesized using the Amersham cDNA synthesis kit and was ligated into the EcoRI site of the λ ZAP II vector (Stratagene), with a yield of approximately 4 × 105 recombinant clones. The cDNA library was amplified in XL-1 Blue cells. The amplified library was screened by standard procedures(22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using, as a probe, a 300-bp PCR fragment obtained as described above. The cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the Multiprime DNA Labeling System (Amersham) to a specific activity of >1 × 109 cpm/μg DNA. The final washing was performed in 0.1 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 mol/liter NaCl and 0.015 mol/liter sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 0.1% SDS at 55° C, followed by autoradiography. The isolated clones were then excised with R408 helper phage from the λ ZAP II phage to yield the inserts in pBS. The sizes of the inserts were estimated by the EcoRI digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. Nucleotide sequences of selected clones were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination methods following the Exo/Mung procedure (Takara Shuzo, Japan). All the sequences in Fig. 1 were verified from both DNA strands. Nucleotide homology searches were performed against sequences in GenBank. Total RNA was extracted from thyroid, lung, heart, kidney, colon, and liver in a 12-week-old Wistar rat by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method. 20 μg of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde gels and blotted onto Hybond nylon membrane paper (Amersham) by standard techniques (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using 10 × SSC. After prehybridization at 42° C for more than 4 h in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE is 0.18 mol/liter NaCl and 0.01 mol/liter NaH2PO4, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, pH 7.0), 1% SDS, and 100 mg/liter denatured salmon sperm DNA, hybridization was performed overnight at 42° C with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe of the PCR product in the same buffer. The final washing was performed in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55° C, followed by autoradiography. The blot was stripped by boiling in 0.1% SDS for 10 min, and reprobed with cyclophilin cDNA to estimate relative amounts of mRNA on the blot. mRNA sizes were estimated relative to 28 and 18 S rRNA. The cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the Multiprime DNA Labeling System to a specific activity of >1 × 109 cpm/μg DNA. Densitometric analysis was performed with a Fujix Bioimaging Analyzer BAS-2000 (Fuji, Japan). Approximately 5 × 106 cells were suspended in 300 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mmol/liter EDTA, 250 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mg/liter leupepsin, homogenized, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was used for the following experiments. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (23.Bradford M.M. Anal Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using reagents provided by Bio-Rad (Protein Assay Kit). Samples were boiled for 10 min in the presence of SDS-PAGE sample buffer(24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins per sample (20 μg) were applied to a 7.5% acrylamide separating gel, transferred overnight to a Immobilon PVDF Transfer Membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS (0.15 mol/liter NaCl, 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) overnight at 4°C and then immunoblotted with polyclonal rabbit antisera against human GRK5 (Santa Cruz Biochemistry) (dilution 1:1,000) at room temperature for 1 h. Following extensive washing with TBS-T (TBS + 0.05% Triton X-100), the immunoblots were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (dilution 1:1,000), and washed extensively with TBS-T. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection of GRK5 was performed according to the instructions supplied with the ECL reagents (Amersham), and signals were detected on Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham). The 2.3-kilobase full-length rat GRK5 cDNA was ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pCR3 (Invitrogen) in the sense and antisense orientations, generating pCR-GRK5S and pCR-GRK5AS, respectively. FRTL5 cells were transfected with these plasmids by the Lipofectin method (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were selected with G418 (500 mg/liter) (Geneticin, Sigma). Clonal cell lines were obtained using cloning cylinders. The expression level of the sense GRK5 mRNA was determined by Northern blot analysis with a cDNA probe prepared by labeling by Multiprime DNA Labeling System of the single stranded pBS containing (+)-strand GRK5 cDNA which was rescued with R408 from the double stranded pBS-GRK5. The expression of the antisense GRK5 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method from multiple clones stably transfected with the pCR-GRK5AS. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the GRK specific sense primer (which anneals only to the antisense GRK5 mRNA), a fraction of which was then amplified by PCR using two GRK primers. PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel. The human GRK6 cDNA in pBS which was kindly provided by Dr. Bonovic (10.Benovic J.L. Gomez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19521-19527Google Scholar) was ligated into the expression vector pCR3. The transfection and selection with G418 were performed as described above. The cells were cultured to semi-confluence in 10-cm dishes in 3H-medium. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, the cells were incubated with TSH-free medium for 5 days, and were then passed into 24-well culture plates. After 2 days, the cells were stimulated for the indicated periods at 37° C in the medium supplemented with 10 units/liter TSH and 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. In other experiments, the cells, cultured in the absence of TSH for 7 days, were preincubated for 4 h at 37° C with or without TSH, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for two 30-min periods in medium without TSH to ensure the removal of TSH. The cells were then stimulated for 30 min at 37° C with the medium containing 10 units/liter TSH and 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Intracellular cAMP concentrations were measured as previously reported (25.Hirayu H. Magnusson R.P. Rapoport B. Mol. Cell. Endocr. 1985; 42: 21-27Google Scholar) by radioimmunoassay (Yamasa cAMP kits, Yamasa Shoyu, Japan). Each experiment involved duplicate or triplicate wells and was repeated at least twice. Using degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to highly conserved sequences in the catalytic domain of members of the GRK family, the DNA fragments of the expected size (approximately 300 bp) were successfully amplified by PCR from human and rat thyroid cDNA. The PCR products were then subcloned into pBS and their nucleotide sequences were determined. As summarized in Table 1, of 30 cDNA clones obtained from a human thyroid, 27 were identical to human GRK5, 2 were GRK4, and −1 was GRK6. In the rat thyroid, of 20 cDNA clones sequenced, 19 and 1 showed approximately 90% homology to human GRK5 and −4, respectively, suggesting these may be rat GRK5 and 4. Rat GRK4 and −5 cDNAs have not previously been cloned. Neither GRK1, −2, nor −3 were observed in human and rat thyroids. No novel GRK mRNA species was identified.Tabled 1 Since these data indicate that the predominant GRK isoform expressed in the thyroid is likely to be GRK5 and because a well characterized, normal rat thyroid epithelial cell line, FRTL5 cells, is a very useful model for further functional studies, we attempted to clone rat GRK5 cDNA. 4 × 105 recombinant phages of a rat FRTL5 cDNA library were screened with the PCR fragment of the rat GRK5-like cDNA mentioned above. We isolated four independent clones at high stringency condition. Partial nucleotide sequencing of these four clones revealed that the 5′-ends of all four clones were very similar, varying by no more than 20 bp (data not shown). The nucleotide sequence of one cDNA clone with the longest 5′-end was determined in full (data not shown). The 2.3-kilobase sequence consists of a single open reading frame of 1770 bp flanked by 183 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence and 365 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence with a short stretch of poly(A) tract. The assignment of the initiation codon ATG is based on the high degree of similarity of the N termini of GRKs. Rat, as well as human and bovine(9.Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5588-5592Google Scholar, 26.Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Google Scholar), GRK5 do not have a Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation(27.Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Google Scholar). The open reading frame of GRK5 cDNA encodes a protein of 590 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 68 kilodaltons. Deduced amino acid sequence of rat GRK5 was shown in Fig. 1. Comparison of this nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence with those of the previously identified members of mammalian GRK family indicates that this sequence is a rat homolog of human GRK5: 88.8% nucleotide homology and 95.1% amino acid homology. While this work was in progress, bovine GRK5 cDNA was isolated (26.Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Google Scholar) and has a very high homology with rat GRK5 (94.0% amino acid identity). As mentioned in the Introduction, GRKs can be grouped into three distinct subfamilies, GRK1, GRK2/3, and GRK4/5/6. The similarity between GRK4/5/6 is ~80%, that between GRK4/5/6 and GRK1/2 ~60%, and that between GRK4/5/6 and GRK1 is intermediate (~70%). GRK5 has some similarities to and differences with other GRKs. For instance, the catalytic domain in the central region of the GRK5 contains a DLG sequence, a feature characteristic of the GRKs. On the other hand, the C-terminal domain does not possess a CAAX motif for isoprenylation or G protein β/γ-binding site(4.Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Google Scholar). mRNA distribution in several tissues was then investigated by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2). The highest expression of GRK5 mRNA was observed in lung > colon, kidney, and heart > thyroid. Absence of GRK5 message in liver is consistent with the previous reports for human and bovine GRK5, but renal expression of GRK5 may be unique in rat(9.Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5588-5592Google Scholar, 26.Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Google Scholar). Three different sizes of messages, ~3, 8, and 10 kilobases in length, were identified in all cases, probably by use of alternative polyadenylation signals. Alternatively, the 8- and 10-kilobase messages may be precursors of mature mRNA. Rat thyroid RNA (20 μg of total RNA) demonstrated little detectable bands for GRK4 and GRK6 even by longer exposure (data not shown). To clarify the functional properties of GRK5 in thyroid cells, especially in the TSH receptor signal transductory system, the cDNA in the sense or antisense orientation (GRK5S or GRK5AS) was stably transfected into rat thyroid FRTL5 cells. After selection with G418, multiple independent cell lines were selected for each transfectant. The data obtained with two clones for each transfectants are shown in Figure 3:, Figure 4:. The FRTL5-GRK5S-1 and −2 expressed approximately 6- and 4-fold higher levels of GRK5 mRNA and 5- and 3-fold higher levels of the protein, respectively, than did the wild type (wt) FRTL5 cells (Fig. 3). In FRTL5-GRK5AS, the expression of the antisense message was detected by RT-PCR with the sense GRK5-specific oligonucleotide primer in the RT reaction (data not shown). FRTL5-GRK5AS-1 and −2 expressed approximately one-forth and one-half of sense GRK5 mRNA and one-third and one-half of the protein, respectively, compared to those in the wt-FRTL5 cells. In the first series of experiments, these transfectants as well as the wt-FRTL5 cells, cultured in TSH-free medium for 7 days, were incubated with 10 units/liter TSH for up to 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4A, maximum intracellular cAMP concentrations were observed 30 min after TSH stimulation in each cell type. The magnitude of cAMP increase was very similar among three clones (data not shown). In the wt-FRTL5 cells, cAMP levels then gradually declined to 49.3 ± 2.3, 41.0 ± 2.6, and 56.7 ± 3.1% (% maximum, mean ± S.D.) after 2, 4, and 24 h TSH stimulation, respectively. The extent of desensitization was more pronounced in the cells stably expressing the sense GRK5 RNA (FRTL5-GRK5S). For example, cAMP levels 2, 4, and 24 h after TSH stimulation were 26.3 ± 1.5, 13.0 ± 1.0, and 25.3 ± 1.2%, respectively, in FRTL5-GRK5S-1 (p < 0.01 versus the wt-FRTL5 in each point). On the contrary, in cells expressing the antisense GRK5 RNA (FRTL5-GRK5AS), the extent of desensitization after 2, 4, and 24 h incubation with TSH was less evident (for example, 63.3 ± 2.5, 59.7 ± 7.5, and 76.0 ± 6.6% in FRTL5-GRK5AS-1, p < 0.05 versus the wt-FRTL5 in each point). In the second series of experiments, the wt-FRTL5, FRTL5-GRK5S-1, and FRTL5-GRK5AS-1 were pretreated with 10 units/liter TSH for 4 h, washed extensively, and were then stimulated with 10 units/liter TSH for 30 min (Fig. 4B). The reasons for the 4-h pretreatment of the cells with TSH in these experiments are: (i) the data obtained in the foregoing studies suggested that 4 h incubation of the cells with TSH was sufficient for the maximal desensitization (Fig. 4A), and (ii) previous studies have shown that the TSH receptor down-regulation, another mechanism of the diminished receptor responsiveness, is not manifest after 4 h treatment of FRTL5 cells with TSH(28.Foti D. Catalfamo R. Russo D. Costante G. Filetti S. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1991; 14: 213-218Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, cAMP response to the second TSH stimulation was lower in FRTL5-GRK5S than in the wt-FRTL5 cells (10.3 ± 0.6% of the maximum response in FRTL5-GRK5S versus 28.0 ± 4.6% in the wt-FRTL5, p < 0.01), but higher in FRTL5-GRK5AS (44.7 ± 7.1%, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the basal cAMP level prior to TSH pretreatment was significantly lower in FRTL5-GRK5S cells than in the wt-FRTL5 (1.0 ± 0.1 pmol/well in FRTL5-GRK5S versus 1.3 ± 0.1 pmol/well in the wt-FRTL5, p < 0.05), and that in FRTL5-GRK5AS was slightly, but not significantly, higher than that in the wt-FRTL5 (1.6 ± 0.3 pmol/well, p > 0.05). Differences in the basal levels of cAMP became more evident after 4 h pretreatment with TSH. Thus, those of the wt-FRTL5, FRTL5-GRK5S, and FRTL5-GRK5AS were 8.3 ± 1.5, 2.3 ± 0.6, and 16.3 ± 1.5 pmol/well (p < 0.01), respectively. These data clearly demonstrate that the expression levels of GRK5 was positively correlated with the extent of TSH receptor desensitization. To evaluate kinase-receptor specificity, another isotype of GRK, GRK6 (10.Benovic J.L. Gomez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19521-19527Google Scholar), was also stably expressed in FRTL5 cells (FRTL5-GRK6S). Two clones, FRTL5-GRK6S-1 and −2, which expressed exogenous GRK6 mRNA (Fig. 5), were selected. In these cells, as shown in Fig. 6, cAMP levels 2 and 4 h after TSH stimulation were significantly lower than those in the wt-FRTL5 cells (for example, 37.2 ± 11.0 and 17.7 ± 7.9% in FRTL5-GRK6S-1 versus 74.2 ± 8.8 and 43.5 ± 10.2% in the wt-FRTL5, p < 0.05 in each point), suggesting that the TSH receptor desensitization can also be influenced by other isotypes of GRKs.Figure 6:Desensitization of the TSH receptor in FRTL5 cells stably expressing sense GRK6 RNA. The cells cultured without TSH for 7 days were stimulated with 10 units/liter TSH and 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine at 37° C for the indicated periods shown in the horizontal line. Intracellular cAMP concentrations were then measured by radioimmunoassay. Data are representative of two separate experiments; each point represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate values determined in triplicate of cells, and are expressed as % of maximum obtained with 30-min TSH stimulation. ∗, p < 0.05 (unpaired Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the present studies, we evaluated the molecular mechanisms of homologous desensitization of the TSH receptor in the thyroid.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Google Scholar), we speculated that, like these receptors, phosphorylation of the agonist-bound TSH receptor by GRK(s) and subsequent binding of arrestin(s) to phosphorylated TSH receptor might be involved in receptor desensitization. In the present studies we focused on one of these proteins, GRK, and first attempted to clarify subtypes of GRK expressed in the thyroid by RT-PCR. We also wished to determine if there was a novel thyroid-specific GRK. Although no novel GRK was detected in the thyroid, our data demonstrate that, of 6 different types of GRKs, GRK5 appears to be the predominant isoform expressed in both human and rat thyroids. The fact that little message was detected for GRK4 and GRK6 in Northern blot analysis with rat thyroid RNA (20 μg of total RNA) supports this finding. The expression level of GRK5 mRNA in the thyroid is, however, not higher than that in other tissues such as lung, colon, heart, and kidney in Northern blot analysis. We next studied the functional properties of GRK5 in rat FRTL5 thyroid cells by the cloning and transfection of rat GRK5 cDNA. Enhancement and suppression of GRK5 expression was achieved by stable transfection of the cloned sense and antisense cDNAs, respectively. The present studies clearly demonstrate that overexpression or underexpression of GRK5 in vivo increased or attenuated, respectively, homologous desensitization of the TSH receptor. These data, together with the fact that the GRK5 may be the predominant GRK isoform in the thyroid, implicates GRK5 in TSH receptor homologous desensitization. Similar approaches have recently been employed by others and demonstrate in vivo functional properties of GRKs. Thus, overexpression of β-ARK is reported to enhance β2-adrenergic receptor desensitization(29.Pippig S. Andexinger S. Daniel K. Puzicha M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3201-3208Google Scholar), and suppression of β-ARK expression by antisense oligonucleotides, overexpression of a β-ARK dominant negative mutant, or neutralizing antibodies against β-ARK2 successfully attenuates desensitization of β2-adrenergic, m2 muscarinic receptors, or odorant receptor(30.Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Google Scholar, 31.Contrera J.G. Mcleskey S.W. Holopainen I. Xu J. Wojcik W.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 265: 433-440Google Scholar, 32.Kong G. Penn R. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13084-13087Google Scholar, 33.Dawson T.M. Arriza J.L. Jaworsky D.E. Borisy F.F. Attramadal H. Lefkowitz R.J. Ronnett G.V. Science. 1993; 259: 825-829Google Scholar). Furthermore, our data also suggest that GRK5 limits the extent of TSH receptor homologous desensitization in FRTL5 cells, a finding consistent with the previous studies with β2-adrenergic receptor(29.Pippig S. Andexinger S. Daniel K. Puzicha M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3201-3208Google Scholar). The incomplete attenuation of TSH receptor desensitization in the cells expressing the antisense GRK5 mRNA can be explained largely by the incomplete suppression of the endogenous GRK5 mRNA expression (Fig. 4A), although another possibility cannot be excluded that other kinases such as GRK4 and 6, which are expressed in the thyroid only in a very small quantity, together may also participate desensitization of the TSH receptor because exogenously overexpressed GRK6 enhanced desensitization of the TSH receptor (Fig. 6). Although it is reported that some GRKs prefer certain types of receptor, the substrate specificity of GRKs is in general not strict(2.Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Google Scholar, 3.Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Google Scholar). Indeed GRK5 phosphorylates rhodopsin, β2- and α2-adrenergic and m2-muscarinic receptors in vitro(4.Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Google Scholar, 9.Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5588-5592Google Scholar, 34.Pei G. Tiberi M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3633-3636Google Scholar). Which GRK(s) are involved in desensitization of the TSH receptor depends not only on the intrinsic ability of individual GRKs to desensitize the receptor but also on the concentration of individual GRKs in the thyroid cells. From these data, we speculate that GRK5 may be capable of phosphorylating the TSH receptor, although there is at present no direct evidence supporting this thesis. It has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor by GRKs occurs in the cytoplasmic C-terminal tails(35.Palczewski K. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 387-391Google Scholar), whereas the phosphorylation site by GRK in the α2-adrenergic receptor appears to be in the third cytoplasmic loop(36.Liggett S.B. Ostrowski J. Chesnut L.C. Kurose H. Raymond J.R. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4740-4746Google Scholar). We and others have shown that the truncated TSH receptor in which the serine/threonine-rich cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of the receptor is deleted undergoes homologous desensitization, like the full-length receptor(17.Nagayama Y. Chazenbalk G.D. Takeshita A. Kimura H. Ashizawa K. Yokoyama N. Rapoport B. Nagataki S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1060-1065Google Scholar, 37.Haraguchi K. Saito T. Kanashige M. Endo T. Onaya T. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 13: 283-288Google Scholar, 38.Shi Y. Zou M. Ahring P. Farid N.R. Endocr. J. 1993; 1: 157-162Google Scholar), suggesting other sites, such as the third cytoplasmic loop of the TSH receptor, may be targeted by GRKs. Further studies regarding agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the TSH receptor by GRK5 will be required. This kind of study could be employed in reconstituted systems with purified proteins. However, purification of the TSH receptor has not yet been attained(39.Nagayama Y. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 145-156Google Scholar). Furthermore, although it has recently been reported that crude membranes from insect cells overexpressing GRKs, rather than purified receptors, can be used for phosphorylation studies(40.Debburman S. Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 224-233Google Scholar), the functional full-length TSH receptor cannot be expressed in insect cells. This is probably due to the incomplete or improper glycosylation of the receptor protein in insect cells(41.Chazenbalk G.D. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1543-1549Google Scholar, 42.Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Google Scholar). In summary, the present studies demonstrate that (i) GRK5 appears to be the predominant isoform of GRK in the thyroid, and (ii) the expression levels of GRK5 are positively correlated with the extent of TSH receptor desensitization. From these data we conclude that GRK5 appears to be involved in homologous desensitization of the TSH receptor in the thyroid.

The molecular basis for the control of the PRLR gene expression is currently unknown. Analyses of the 5′-untranslated regions of PRLR mRNAs expressed in gonadal and non-gonadal tissues and their genomic organization revealed three alternative first exons designated as E11, E12, and E13. Each of these exons is alternatively spliced to a common noncoding exon (exon 2, nucleotides −115 to −56) that precedes the third exon containing the translation initiation codon. Alternative utilization of exons E11, E12, and E13, as well as alternative splicing of exon 2, generates multiple 5′-untranslated regions in PRLR transcripts. These alternative first exons (E11, E12, and E13) were found to be utilized in a tissue-specific manner in vivo. E11 is predominantly expressed in the ovary, E12 is specifically expressed in the liver, and E13 is expressed as a predominant form in the Leydig cell and as a minor form in the ovary and liver. Genomic 5′-flanking regions containing the three putative PRLR gene promoters (PI, PII, and PIII) that initiate the transcription of E11, E12, and E13, respectively, were identified.

We have examined the effect of oxidized LDL on the cofactor activity for thrombin-dependent protein C activation and expression of thrombomodulin (TM), a cell surface antithrombotic glycoprotein, on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Oxidized LDL prepared by irradiation of LDL with 254-nm ultraviolet light did not directly affect the cofactor activity of isolated TM. Exposure of the cells to oxidized LDL (25-200 μg/ml), but not native LDL and acetylated LDL, reduced TM cofactor activity in parallel with its antigen levels on the cell surface in an oxidation-, concentration- and time-dependent manner. TM mRNA levels were reduced prior to decrease in TM antigen levels and were 50% of the control levels at 3.0 h after treatment of the cells with oxidized LDL. The apparent half-life time (t1/2 = 2.8 h) of TM mRNA in the oxidized LDL-treated cells, however, did not significantly differ from that (t1/2 = 2.6 h) in the control cells when the cells were coincubated with 5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, a transcriptional inhibitor. Treatment of the cells with bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor for the proton pump of the lysosomes, inhibited intracellular degradation of the LDL and prevented down-regulations of the mRNA and the cell surface TM antigen levels caused by oxidized LDL. The inhibitor molecule in oxidized LDL was shown to be a lipid; organic solvent extracts (300 mg/ml cholesterol, an equivalent concentration with lipids in 200 μg/ml oxidized LDL) of oxidized LDL inhibited expression of TM antigen to nearly the same extent as the oxidized LDL, although water extracts did not affect TM expression on the cells. These results suggested that down-regulation of TM on endothelial cells exposed to oxidized LDL resulted from inhibition of its transcription mediated by lysosomal degradation of oxidized LDL and that a lipid component in the LDL could be an active species.

The polypeptide chain-heme equilibrium is an important element in the description of all hemoproteins. However, a direct measure of this parameter is difficult due to the high stability of the holoprotein under physiological conditions(1.Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971: 127-129Google Scholar). The heme-apoprotein linkage, therefore, is usually assessed by studying the heme transfer reaction from a donor to a heme acceptor protein. When the heme acceptor has a very high affinity for heme, like apomyoglobin, the kinetics of the heme transfer process is followed. This is governed by the rate of heme release from the donor protein as the rate of heme association is very high(2.Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Google Scholar, 3.Smith M.L. Hijortsberg K. Romeo P.-H. Rosa J. Paul K.G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 147-150Google Scholar). When the heme donor and acceptor proteins have similar affinities for heme, the heme is partitioned between the two proteins and hence both kinetic and equilibrium features of the heme transfer reaction can be exploited(4.Bunn H.F. Jandl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 465-475Google Scholar, 5.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14881-14885Google Scholar). In the case of human hemoglobin (HbA) there are relatively few quantitative estimates of the stability of the heme-globin linkage despite its relevance in the study of mutant and chemically modified hemoglobins(2.Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Google Scholar, 3.Smith M.L. Hijortsberg K. Romeo P.-H. Rosa J. Paul K.G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 147-150Google Scholar, 4.Bunn H.F. Jandl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 465-475Google Scholar, 5.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14881-14885Google Scholar, 6.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Google Scholar). The interaction between heme and globin is known to be affected by a number of parameters. Of major importance are the redox state of the protein and pH(2.Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Google Scholar, 4.Bunn H.F. Jandl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 465-475Google Scholar, 5.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14881-14885Google Scholar). Thus, heme is released only from oxidized, met-aquo-hemoglobin, but not from the reduced protein and more so upon departure from neutral pH values. In met-aquo-hemoglobin, the rate of heme release from β chains is considerably faster than from α chains. Furthermore, the kinetics of heme dissociation from αβ dimers is much greater than from α2β2 tetramers(5.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14881-14885Google Scholar, 6.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Google Scholar). In the isolated α and β chains to our knowledge the heme-globin affinity has never been measured, presumably due to the very marked tendency of the respective globins to precipitate. As a matter of fact in all studies of heme dissociation from hemoglobin or from myoglobin the formation of free, precipitable globin upon heme depletion of the ferric protein is a common problem (3.Smith M.L. Hijortsberg K. Romeo P.-H. Rosa J. Paul K.G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 147-150Google Scholar, 5.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14881-14885Google Scholar, 6.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Google Scholar) that has been alleviated in part by adding sucrose to the incubation medium(2.Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Google Scholar). We have addressed the problem of globin precipitation in a different manner and propose the use of αβ dimers immobilized on Sepharose 4B (7.Antonini E. Rossi Fanelli M.R. Chiancone E. Sund H. Blauer G. Protein-Ligand Interactions. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1975: 45-59Google Scholar, 8.Rossi Fanelli M.R. Amiconi G. Antonini E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 253-259Google Scholar, 9.Chiancone E. Gattoni M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 135: 484-491Google Scholar, 10.Chiancone E. Winzor D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 211-216Google Scholar) as heme donor. This material offers a number of advantages: it is stable after heme depletion, it does not undergo changes in state of association, it can be lyophilized, and, most importantly, it can be separated easily from the acceptor protein. Therefore formation of the heme-acceptor complex can be followed spectrophotometrically in a facile way under any experimental condition. As heme acceptor we have used human albumin which is endowed with two high affinity heme binding sites (11.Rosenfeld M. Surgenor D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1950; 183: 663-677Google Scholar) and whose affinity for heme does not change in the pH range 5-10(12.Beaven G.H. Chen S.-H. d'Albis A. Gratzer W.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 41: 539-546Google Scholar). Transfer of heme from hemoglobin to albumin to form methemalbumin is known to occur in the blood of patients with plasma hemoglobinemia and “in vitro” when albumin is mixed with ferric hemoglobin(4.Bunn H.F. Jandl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 465-475Google Scholar, 5.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14881-14885Google Scholar). The immobilized αβ dimers behave like the soluble protein in that they do not transfer heme to albumin when in the oxy or CO form, but only when in the oxidized state, an indication that the immobilization process does not produce significant alterations in the heme environment. The direct comparison of the rate of heme loss from soluble dimers has confirmed this contention. The behavior of isolated α and β chains both in solution and after immobilization on Sepharose 4B has also been studied. Quite unexpectedly, soluble α and β chains transfer heme readily to albumin even when oxygenated or in the CO-bound form, a finding which points to a major change in the heme pocket induced by the assembly of unlike chains into a heterodimer. Human serum albumin, crystallized and lyophilized, was a commercial product of Sigma and was used without further purification. Albumin concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, using the molar absorbance E280 nm1cm = 9.8 × 10-5. Human hemoglobin was prepared according to Berger et al.(13.Berger R.L. Carpenter L. Everse J. Kaplan J.L. Anal. Lett. 1973; 6: 125-129Google Scholar) and was immobilized covalently in the oxygenated state on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). The coupling reaction was carried out in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.3, in the presence of ethanolamine in 10:1 molar excess with respect to heme. The suspension was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and washed thereafter on a filter funnel as described in (9.Chiancone E. Gattoni M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 135: 484-491Google Scholar). This procedure leads to immobilization of hemoglobin as αβ dimers which are coupled to Sepharose via either chain and maintain the capacity to interact in a specific and reversible manner with soluble dimers(7.Antonini E. Rossi Fanelli M.R. Chiancone E. Sund H. Blauer G. Protein-Ligand Interactions. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1975: 45-59Google Scholar, 8.Rossi Fanelli M.R. Amiconi G. Antonini E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 253-259Google Scholar, 9.Chiancone E. Gattoni M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 135: 484-491Google Scholar, 10.Chiancone E. Winzor D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 211-216Google Scholar). The concentration of immobilized oxyhemoglobin was typically around 8 mg/ml of packed resin. It was determined on every preparation using a 1-mm light path cell and a Cary 219 spectrophotometer; the effect of turbidity was minimized by the use of protein-free gel in the reference cell(9.Chiancone E. Gattoni M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 135: 484-491Google Scholar). Immobilized oxy-αβ dimers (Fig. 1A) were oxidized by addition of two to three equivalents of potassium ferricyanide at neutral pH; excess ferricyanide and the ferrocyanide produced during the oxidation reaction were removed by washing extensively the gel on a filter funnel. The immobilized met-αβ dimers were then lyophilized in the presence of 10% sucrose. The optical absorption spectrum of the immobilized met-αβ dimers equilibrated with buffers of pH 6.5-9.0 (Fig. 1, B-D) displays the same pH dependence of the soluble protein ((1.Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971: 127-129Google Scholar), page 45). Isolated α and β chains were prepared according to Geraci et al.(14.Geraci G. Parkhurst L.J. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4664-4667Google Scholar). Heme transfer from the soluble chains to albumin was followed in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments carried out according to Davis(15.Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 121: 404-427Google Scholar). The chains were mixed with albumin, and the mixture was incubated at 4 or 20°C and then subjected to electrophoresis. The gels were stained for heme with benzidine and for protein with Coomassie Blue. The immobilization reaction was carried out on the oxygenated derivative in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and yielded a concentration of immobilized chains between 1 and 5 mg/ml of packed resin. Oxidation of the immobilized chains was performed as described for hemoglobin. A known amount of lyophilized, immobilized met-αβ hemoglobin dimers (ranging from 25 to 400 mg) was mixed in a test tube with 2.5 ml of buffer containing albumin at a known concentration and the test tube was placed in a water bath thermostatted at 20°C. At established times, a filter sampler (Porex Medical, Fairburn, GA) was gently pressed into the test tube to separate the solid phase from the supernatant, whose absorbance was measured between 450 and 650 nm on a Cary 219 spectrophotometer. Formation of methemalbumin can thus be followed without interference from immobilized hemoglobin. Methemalbumin concentration was determined using a millimolar specific absorbance (heme basis) of 9.5 at 530 nm; this value was obtained with the pyridine hemochromogen method(1.Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971: 127-129Google Scholar). The buffers used in the heme transfer experiments were: 0.1 M Tris-HCl plus 0.1 M NaCl at pH 9.0 or 7.5; 0.05 M bis-Tris 1The abbreviation used is: bis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino]2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. -HCl plus 0.1 M NaCl at pH 7.0 or 6.5; 0.1 M phosphate at pH 7.18. 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino]2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. Heme transfer from immobilized met-αβ dimers to albumin can be described by the minimal reaction scheme, αβH+A⇔αβH+A⇔αβ+AH where αβ is the immobilized dimer, A stands for albumin and H for heme. In view of the different behavior of α and β chains, the kinetic analysis was carried out by approximating the overall reaction to the following equilibria, kAA+H⇌A⋅AHk1(Eq. 1) kαα+H⇄αHk1(Eq. 2) kββ+H⇄βHk−β(Eq. 3) where α and β are the hemoglobin chains in the immobilized αβ dimer. An iterative diagonalization of the rate constants matrix relative to the processes described by the equilibria () was used to fit the time course of methemalbumin formation. The second order processes were linearized by assuming dH/dt = 0(2.Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Google Scholar). In the fitting procedure: (i) the rate constants kA and k-A were fixed at the values determined in independent experiments, i.e. at 5 × 104M-1 s-1 and 3.2 × 10-4 s-1; (ii) the concentrations of heme-depleted α and β chains as well as the dissociation rate constants k-α and k-β were allowed to float; (iii) the amount of heme associated with the globin chains and with albumin was fixed to the value determined experimentally at the end of the reaction (see Fig. 8), thereby fixing the values of the rates for heme binding, kα and kβ, at each iteration. In these experiments human hemoglobin after oxidation with an excess of potassium ferricyanide was equilibrated with 0.1 M Tris-HCl plus 0.1 M NaCl and 0.3 M sucrose, pH 9.0, on a Sephadex G25 column. Hemoglobin solutions at 5 × 10-6M (in heme) were mixed with the same volume of 5 × 10-6M albumin in the same buffer and the heme transfer reaction was followed at 410 nm in a Hewlett-Packard 8542A spectrophotometer for about 180 min at 20°C. The kinetics of heme transfer was analyzed in terms of three first order processes corresponding to: 1) heme release from the β chains in αβ dimers, 2) heme release from β chains in α2β2 tetramers, 3) a slow process which comprises heme release from the α chains and heme release from methemalbumin. In the fitting procedure the relative amplitudes of processes 1 and 2 were fixed at the amounts of dimers and tetramers present at equilibrium on the basis of the dimer-tetramer association constant measured in parallel ultracentrifugation experiments. The amplitude of the slow phase and the three rate constants were allowed to float. Titration experiments were carried out at a constant albumin concentration of 1.3 μM in 0.1 M Tris-HCl plus 0.1 M NaCl, pH 9.0, by adding small volumes of a hemin solution in the same buffer at 20°C. Given the low concentrations involved a 10 cm cell was used. Formation of the methemalbumin complex was followed at 403 nm. At any given point in the titration the contribution of free hemin to the observed absorbance was subtracted. The data were analyzed according to a simple two sites Adair equation, Y=K1[M+2K1K2[M22(1+K1[H]+K1K2[H]2)(Eq. 4) where Y is the fractional saturation of albumin with heme, [H] is the concentration of free hemin, and K1 and K2 are the affinity constants of the two albumin binding sites. The kinetic parameters of the reaction were measured at 20°C on an Applied Photophysics (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, United Kingdom) stopped flow apparatus (dead time 3 ms) upon mixing hemin with albumin in 0.1 M Tris-HCl plus 0.1 M NaCl, pH 9.0. All reactant concentrations are after mixing unless otherwise stated. All the algorithms used to fit the experimental data were elaborated with the software package Matlab (The Math Works Inc., Natick, MA). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a Beckman model XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at 40,000 rpm and 20°C over the concentration range 0.0043-0.5 g/dl (0.27-3.1 × 10-5M heme). The gradient of protein concentration in the cells was determined by absorption scans along the centrifugation radius at a single wavelength (410, 540, or 630 nm) with a step resolution of 0.001 cm. Sedimentation coefficients were evaluated with the software provided by Beckman and were reduced to s20,w according to standard procedures. The weight fraction of tetramers, α, at any given concentration c, was calculated on the basis of the measured value of s20,w (a weight average property) and of s4c - s2c, where s4c and s2c correspond to the sedimentation velocity of tetramers and dimers, respectively, at concentration c. In turn, s4c = s40 (1 - 0.07c) and s2c = s20 (1 - 0.07c) with c expressed in g/dl(16.Chiancone E. Gilbert L.M. Gilbert G.A. Kellett G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1212-1219Google Scholar). The value of s40, the sedimentation coefficient for the tetramer at zero protein concentration, namely 4.7 S, was used to calculate s20, the corresponding value for the dimer, assuming that sedimentation coefficient is proportional to (Mr)2/3(16.Chiancone E. Gilbert L.M. Gilbert G.A. Kellett G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1212-1219Google Scholar, 17.Gilbert L.M. Gilbert G.A. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 273-296Google Scholar). The curves for K2,4, the dimer-tetramer association constant, were calculated from the mass law expression according to (17.Gilbert L.M. Gilbert G.A. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 273-296Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed using a Beckman model XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at 20,000 rpm and 10°C in 0.1 M Tris-HCl plus 0.1 M NaCl, pH 9.0, over the concentration range 0.75-5.0 × 10-6M heme. The data (20 averages/scan) were analyzed with the software “Multi” for self-associating systems provided by Beckman. The reaction between heme and albumin has been reinvestigated prior to performing the heme transfer experiments. The titration curve of albumin with hemin (Fig. 2) was analyzed according to and points to the presence of two high affinity binding sites for hemin, characterized by K1 = 7.8 × 107M-1 and K2 = 2.3 × 108M-1 in good agreement with the values reported in (11.Rosenfeld M. Surgenor D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1950; 183: 663-677Google Scholar). The kinetics of the reaction has been investigated by mixing in a stopped flow apparatus 3.6 μM hemin with albumin at concentrations varying between about 20 and 250 μM. Hemin was used at a low concentration to minimize its tendency to polymerize. The time course is monophasic and has been analyzed as a first order reaction. The pseudo first order rate constant (Fig. 3) depends linearly on albumin concentration up to approximately 25 μM; at higher protein concentrations a constant value of 1.3 s-1 is reached. This value, which relates to a rate-limiting monomolecular step, is close to the rate of hemin depolymerization(18.Brown S.B. Dean T.C. Jones P. Biochem. J. 1970; 117: 733-739Google Scholar). From the data in Fig. 3 an association rate constant for hemin binding to albumin of 5 (±0.9) × 104M-1 s-1 can be obtained. This value in combination with the average affinity constant determined independently (see above) yields an average rate of heme dissociation from albumin of 3.2 (±0.11) × 10-4 s-1. Either type of chain releases heme to albumin at pH 9.0 not only when oxidized, but also when in the CO-liganded state. The shift of a substantial amount of heme from CO-bound α and β chains to albumin is clearly shown by the electrophoresis patterns of Fig. 4. Under similar experimental conditions, there is no heme transfer from CO-liganded HbA to albumin as reported by Bunn and Jandl(4.Bunn H.F. Jandl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 465-475Google Scholar). Immobilized CO-liganded α and β chains exposed to albumin at pH 9.0 and 20°C behave similarly to the soluble ones and give rise readily to a significant amount of methemalbumin (Fig. 5A). It is of interest that methemalbumin is formed indicating that CO is lost upon or before binding. An equilibrium distribution is attained after about 180 min; at equilibrium, when albumin is in 3-fold molar excess (in terms of heme binding sites), about 50% of the heme is in the form of methemalbumin. Under similar experimental conditions immobilized oxidized chains loose all their heme (Fig. 5A). The heme transfer process displays two clearly separated kinetic phases (Fig. 6). The time course was fitted using the scheme and the approximations presented under “Materials and Methods” by considering the contribution of only one chain. The rate of the slow phase was taken as 3.2 × 10-4 s-1, which corresponds to the rate of heme dissociation from albumin estimated from the measurements on the heme-albumin system. The rate of the fast phase, which can be assigned to heme release from the α or β chains is 4.5-7.5 × 10-2 s-1 and does not depend within experimental error on the chain type and on the state of heme oxidation (Table 1). In a further set of experiments the observation that methemalbumin is formed upon transfer of heme from the CO-bound chains was exploited as it enables measurement of heme transfer from soluble chains to albumin. Upon mixing β chains at 7 × 10-5M with albumin at 3.4 × 10-4M at pH 9 and 20°C in the presence of 0.3 M sucrose(2.Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Google Scholar), a biphasic reaction is observed (Fig. 7). The fast rate, 0.2 × 10-2 s-1, is roughly 5-fold slower than that measured with immobilized β chains. It was first established that immobilized αβ dimers, like soluble hemoglobin, do not transfer heme to human albumin when in the oxy, CO, or CN-met form, but dissociate heme rapidly in the ferric, met-aquo form (Fig. 5B). This finding is of importance as it shows that the immobilization and lyophilization steps do not produce significant alterations in the heme environment. Thereafter heme transfer experiments were carried out by mixing different amounts of immobilized met-aquo αβ dimers with a constant concentration of albumin at pH 9.0 and incubating the mixture at 20°C. Under these experimental conditions an equilibrium distribution is reached within 24 h. The heme transferred from the immobilized dimers to albumin at equilibrium is around 30% when heme is in excess over albumin and approaches 100% at the lowest heme/albumin ratio tested (Fig. 8); conversely, the saturation of albumin with heme increases with increase in heme/albumin molar ratio (data not shown). The time course of methemalbumin formation at different heme/albumin molar ratios is given in Fig. 9A. It can be described by a fast and a slow process whose apparent rate differs by approximately 50-fold, both rates increase slightly upon increasing pH from 6.5 to 9.0 (see Table 1). The amplitude of the fast process predominates at the higher heme/albumin molar ratios (Table 2). Bunn and Jandl(4.Bunn H.F. Jandl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 465-475Google Scholar), when studying the exchange of hemes between hemoglobins A and F, observed that the process is biphasic and proposed that the fast rate reflects the dissociation of heme from non-α chains and the slower one dissociation from the α chains. This assignment has been confirmed recently by Hargrove et al.(2.Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Google Scholar) with the aid of mutant hybrid methemoglobins and valence hybrids in which one subunit is oxidized. The data in Fig. 9 can be interpreted in the same way: when hemoglobin is in excess, rapid dissociation of heme from the β chains predominates as indicated by the greater amplitude of the fast process; when albumin is in excess, the contribution of heme dissociation from the α chains becomes relevant and the amplitudes of the fast and slow process are approximately equal. Under all conditions, as the reaction proceeds, there is an accumulation of the heme-albumin complex, and thus, a significant contribution of the rate of hemin dissociation from albumin, in particular to the slow phase. This interpretation was substantiated by the analysis of the heme transfer reaction carried out as outlined under “Materials and Methods.” Both rate constants pertaining to albumin, kA and k-A, 5 × 104M-1 s-1 and 3.2 × 10-4 s-1, respectively, were calculated using the data of Figure 2:, Figure 3:. Likewise, the equilibrium partitioning of hemin between albumin and the immobilized αβ dimers was fixed at the value determined at the end of the experiment reported in Fig. 8. The global fit of the whole set of data yields rate constants of 6.5 × 10-4 and 2.8 × 10-2 s-1, respectively, for the slow and fast phase; the fitted time courses are shown in Fig. 9. Heme transfer experiments similar to those just described were carried out also at pH 7.5 and 6.5. The amount of heme transferred to albumin at equilibrium increases at any given pH with decrease in the heme/albumin molar ratio; at any given ratio of albumin to heme it decreases with decrease in pH. The rate constants which describe the time course of heme exchange are affected only slightly by pH (Table 1). Representative fits at pH 7.5 are included in Fig. 9. Last a set of heme transfer experiments from soluble hemoglobin was performed at pH 9.0 and 20°C. These measurements were designed to compare under the same conditions of pH and temperature the rate of heme loss from immobilized dimers with that from soluble dimers. To this end it appeared necessary to determine the dimer-tetramer association constant of methemoglobin by ultracentrifugation. To our knowledge there are no reports in the literature on this equilibrium. Under the conditions used for the heme transfer experiments, namely Tris buffer I = 0.1 M + 0.1 M NaCl at pH 9.0 and 20°C, the dimer-tetramer association constant was found to lie between 3.2 × 104 and 8.0 × 104M-1 (dimer basis) by sedimentation velocity (Fig. 10). Preliminary sedimentation equilibrium experiments carried out at 10°C yielded 5 × 104M-1. In view of the small temperature dependence of the dimerization reaction at alkaline pH values (ΔH°4,2 13.2 ± 2 kcal/mol; (19.Ide G.J. Barksdale A.D. Rosenberg A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 1595-1596Google Scholar)), the K2,4 value corrected to 20°C, 9 × 104M-1, is close to the upper limit obtained by sedimentation velocity. Thus, when the concentration of soluble met-hemoglobin is 2.5 × 10-6M (heme), the fraction of dimers is close to 90%. The fit to the heme transfer data at this hemoglobin concentration, carried out as described under “Materials and Methods,” yields rates of 1.1 × 10-2 s-1 and 0.2 × 10-2 s-1 for heme loss from β chains in dimers and tetramers, respectively, and 3.8 × 10-4 s-1 for the slow process (Fig. 10). The rate of heme release from β chains in soluble dimers is in very good agreement with that from immobilized ones (Table 1). Likewise the rate of the slow process is fully consistent with the values obtained for heme loss from chains in the dimer (Table 1) and from methemalbumin. Sedimentation velocity experiments were also carried out in 0.15 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and 20°C, in order to assess the amount of tetramers present in solutions of met-hemoglobin under conditions similar to those used by Hargrove et al.(2.Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Google Scholar). Dissociation into dimers is less pronounced than in Tris buffer at pH 9.0 (K2,4 = 1.5 × 105M-1). This finding is not unexpected since dissociation into dimers of oxyhemoglobin, which entails cleavage of the same α1β2 interface, is likewise enhanced at alkaline pH values(20.Antonini E. Chiancone E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1977; 6: 239-271Google Scholar). The experiments presented here show that the stability of the heme-globin linkage in αβ dimers and isolated chains of human hemoglobin can be probed by studying the heme transfer reaction from the immobilized proteins to albumin. Soluble and Sepharose-bound heme-proteins transfer heme to albumin in a similar fashion. From a qualitative viewpoint, only those derivatives which transfer heme to albumin in solution do so when immobilized, and conversely, those derivatives which do not release heme to albumin in solution do not release heme when bound to Sepharose (Fig. 5, A and B). At a quantitative level the direct comparison carried out with both αβ dimers and isolated chains indicates that the immobilization step does not alter the heme environment significantly while providing material that is not easily denatured after heme loss. Thus, the rates of heme transfer from the immobilized proteins are increased only 3- to 6-fold relative to the soluble ones (Table 1). Immobilized heme donors have other advantages; for example they do not undergo changes in state of association, which may complicate analysis of the heme transfer reaction in solution, and can be separated easily from the heme acceptor. The latter property enables one to monitor the relevant spectral changes easily even when the spectral properties of heme donor and acceptor are very similar. In brief, immobilized heme donors provide a solution to several problems that have limited the study of the heme transfer reaction in solution(2.Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Google Scholar, 5.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14881-14885Google Scholar, 6.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Google Scholar). In the present work human albumin has been used as the heme acceptor, because its affinity for heme is comparable with that of human hemoglobin(11.Rosenfeld M. Surgenor D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1950; 183: 663-677Google Scholar). This feature permits determination not only of the kinetic, but also of the equilibrium aspects of the heme transfer reaction. In turn, knowledge of the amount of heme partitioned at transfer equilibrium between the hemoprotein and albumin provides a useful constraint in the fit of the time courses to the reaction scheme. The most interesting finding of this study is that the stability of the heme-globin linkage changes dramatically upon formation of αβ dimers. This change is especially striking in the ferrous CO-bound state: at pH 9.0 and 20°C the isolated chains transfer heme significantly to albumin over a time scale of a few hours, whereas no heme release takes place from αβ dimers (Figure 4:, Figure 5:), which behave like the α2β2 tetramer(4.Bunn H.F. Jandl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 465-475Google Scholar). The assembly of unlike chains, therefore, brings about a major rearrangement in the heme pocket of the ferrous protein which results in considerable strengthening of the heme-globin interaction, such that in practice heme dissociation cannot be measured. Heme oxidation enhances heme release in human hemoglobin (2.Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Google Scholar, 4.Bunn H.F. Jandl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 465-475Google Scholar, 5.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14881-14885Google Scholar) and does so also in the αβ dimers (Fig. 5B), but has a very small effect on the heme transfer properties of the isolated chains (Table 1). This difference in behavior can be ascribed to the different nature of the ferric forms of the proteins. The isolated chains give rise to six-coordinate low spin hemichromes, in which the iron-proximal histidine bond is effectively covalent, while HbA and its immobilized dimers form high spin met-aquo derivatives in which this bond is weakened. It is of interest that isolated α and β chains loose their heme at approximately the same rate (1-6 × 10-2 s-1), whereas in the αβ dimer heme dissociation from the α chains is some 50 times slower than from the β chains (e.g. 0.065 × 10-2 s-1versus 2.8 × 10-2 s-1 at pH 9.0 and 20°C). In turn release of heme from the β chains in the αβ dimer is only 2-3-fold slower than from isolated β chains. The interaction between unlike chains, therefore, enhances the stability of the heme-globin linkage significantly in the α chains and very little in the β chains. It may be envisaged that the constraint on the flexibility of the α chains imposed by the β chains (21.Di Iorio E.E. Hiltpold U.R. Filipovic D. Winterhalter K.H. Gratton E. Vitrano E. Cupane A. Leone M. Cordone L. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 742-754Google Scholar) increases the activation energy for α-heme release and that this constraint is transmitted to the α-heme pocket through the α1β1 interface, since immobilized dimers like the soluble ones are of the α1β1 type (7.Antonini E. Rossi Fanelli M.R. Chiancone E. Sund H. Blauer G. Protein-Ligand Interactions. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1975: 45-59Google Scholar, 8.Rossi Fanelli M.R. Amiconi G. Antonini E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 253-259Google Scholar, 9.Chiancone E. Gattoni M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 135: 484-491Google Scholar, 10.Chiancone E. Winzor D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 211-216Google Scholar). The rate of β-heme release increases with decrease in HbA concentration(6.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Google Scholar), indicating that dissociation of the α2β2 tetramer, and hence a change at the α1β2 interface, affects the stability of the heme-globin bond in the β chains. Our data (Fig. 10) suggest that α chains are little affected. Benesch and Kwong (6.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Google Scholar) report rates of heme loss from β chains in HbA dimers and tetramers under pH and temperature conditions very similar to those used in the present work; release from the α chains was not determined as only 20% of the reaction was followed. The values given by Benesch and Kwong (6.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Google Scholar) are 5-fold lower relative to those reported in Table 1; however, the difference would be less if heme release from albumin had been taken into account. Hargrove et al.(2.Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Google Scholar) report rates of 1.7 ± 1.1 × 10-4 s-1 for α-heme dissociation and 2.2 ± 0.6 × 10-3 s-1 for the β-heme at pH 7.0, 37°C, 2-4 μM heme, a roughly 2-fold increase in both rates at pH 8.0 and relatively small temperature effects. These rates are lower than those reported in Table 1 for α and β chains. However, if one takes the pH dependence into account and the fact that the rate of heme loss from the β chains is decreased by the presence of tetramers (10-25% at 2-4 μM heme under the conditions used by Hargrove et al., 1994), the agreement between the two sets of data is quite good. Last, a comment on the dimer-tetramer association constant of met-HbA is in order, since the value obtained by sedimentation velocity and equilibrium in the present work is considerably lower than that reported recently by Benesch and Kwong(6.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Google Scholar). The ultracentrifugation measurements carried out as a function of met-HbA concentration at pH 9.0 yield values of K2,4 in the range 3-9 × 104M-1, whereas Benesch and Kwong (6.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Google Scholar) obtained 1.4 × 106M-1 from measurements of the initial rate of heme transfer to serum albumin at different hemoglobin concentrations. However, the following considerations render this indirect method questionable. The curve given in Fig. 1, which was used to calculate the dissociation constant for HbA, is not symmetrical as expected on the basis of mass law considerations, indicating that factors other than dissociation into dimers influence the heme loss assay as used by Benesch and Kwong(6.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Google Scholar). Accordingly, in a graph like that presented in Fig. 2 of the same reference, the data points do not lie all on a straight line (in (6.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Google Scholar) the data below zero are not reported). Furthermore, Benesch and Kwong (6.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Google Scholar) take the concordance of the K2,4 value assessed by means of the heme loss assay for met-HbA at pH 9.0 with that obtained by Turner et al.(22.Turner G.J. Galacteros F. Doyle M.L. Hedlund B. Pettigrew D.W. Turner B.W. Smith F.R. Moo-Penn W. Rucknagel D.L. Ackers G.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 14: 333-350Google Scholar) for oxy-HbA at pH 7.4 as a suggestion that neither pH nor the oxidation state of the heme iron can have an important effect on the dimer-tetramer equilibrium. This conclusion is in contrast with current knowledge on the subunit dissociation behavior of hemoglobin (20.Antonini E. Chiancone E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1977; 6: 239-271Google Scholar, 22.Turner G.J. Galacteros F. Doyle M.L. Hedlund B. Pettigrew D.W. Turner B.W. Smith F.R. Moo-Penn W. Rucknagel D.L. Ackers G.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 14: 333-350Google Scholar). A wealth of studies carried out on ferrous HbA have shown subunit assembly to be affected by heme and non-heme ligands, by buffer composition and pH. For instance, alkaline pH values favor dissociation, and the sensitivity to heme ligands is such that dissociation into dimers of oxy- and CO-HbA differs significantly. Oxidation is therefore expected to affect subunit dissociation and indeed the present sedimentation data show that it enhances dissociation. Moreover, dissociation of met-HbA can be expected to be influenced by the same factors which influence the stability of the ferrous tetramer, since the same subunit interface is involved. In conclusion, the present data bring out that in hemoglobin the heme-globin linkage in the α chains is stabilized by interactions between unlike chains at the α1β1 interface, whereas heme binding to the β chains is stabilized by interactions at the α1β2 interface. In accordance with this conclusion in mutant hemoglobins with point mutations at the α1β2 interface, the rate of heme release from the β subunits is increased with respect to HbA (3.Smith M.L. Hijortsberg K. Romeo P.-H. Rosa J. Paul K.G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 147-150Google Scholar). No data on the effect of mutations at the α1β1 interface are available. In addition to these long range effects, which have to be taken into account in any systematic analysis of heme dissociation in mutant and chemically modified hemoglobins, local factors at the heme pocket play an important role in the stabilization of the heme-globin bond. These comprise steric contacts of the porphyrin ring and electrostatic interactions of its propionates with specific side chains in the distal heme pocket like His-64, Val-68, Ser-92, and Arg 45, as discussed by Hargrove et al.(2.Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Google Scholar) in their recent study on myoglobins and hemoglobin hybrids. In the understanding of the complex interplay between all these factors in determining the stability of the heme-globin linkage, the use of immobilized heme donors and of high affinity heme acceptors, which are in preparation, will be of value. We thank Dr. Paola Vecchini for carrying out the ultracentrifuge experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2016764094,"Neurocalcins belong to a family of neuronal specific EF hand Ca2+-binding proteins defined by recoverin. Previously, we reported the cloning and initial characterization of neurocalcin in Drosophila melanogaster (Teng, D. H.-F., Chen, C.-K., and Hurley, J. B.(31.Teng D.H.-F. Chen C.-K. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31900-31907Google Scholar) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 31900-31907). We showed that the Drosophila neurocalcin protein (DrosNCa) is expressed in neurons and that bacterially expressed recombinant DrosNCa (rDrosNCa) can be myristoylated. Here, we present two lines of evidence that DrosNCa is fatty acylated in vivo. First, the mobility of affinity-purified native DrosNCa on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is identical to that of myristoylated rDrosNCa and distinct from that of nonacylated rDrosNCa. Second, the membrane binding properties of native DrosNCa are similar to those of myristoylated rDrosNCa; both of these proteins bind to membranes at 0.2 mM Ca2+, whereas nonacylated rDrosNCa always remains soluble. It has been shown that recoverin inhibits the phosphorylation of rhodopsin when Ca2+ is present (Kawamura et al., 14.Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ray S. Stryer L. Science. 1993; 260: 740Google Scholar) and that a dependent recoverin/rhodopsin kinase interaction underlies the inhibitory effect of recoverin (Chen et al., 3.Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18060-18066Google Scholar). Given the similarities between recoverin and neurocalcin, we examined the effect of DrosNCa on rhodopsin phosphorylation. We find that rDrosNCa is capable of inhibiting bovine rhodopsin phosphorylation in vitro in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The inhibitory activity of rDrosNCa is enhanced by myristoylation, and the potency of its effect is similar to that of recoverin. Two other related EF hand proteins, guanylate cyclase-activating protein-2 and calmodulin, are only poor inhibitors in these phosphorylation assays. in vitro inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation therefore appears to be an assayable property of a subset of recoverin-like proteins. Neurocalcins belong to a family of neuronal specific EF hand Ca2+-binding proteins defined by recoverin. Previously, we reported the cloning and initial characterization of neurocalcin in Drosophila melanogaster (Teng, D. H.-F., Chen, C.-K., and Hurley, J. B.(31.Teng D.H.-F. Chen C.-K. Hurley J.B. J.

Neurons are highly specialized cells that have evolved elaborate mechanisms to sense, integrate, and transmit signals. The calcium ion (Ca2+) is a universal second messenger that is a key player in neuronal signaling. Dynamic fluxes in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ during neuronal excitation, recovery, and adaptation or potentiation, are interpreted by Ca2+-binding proteins that act as transducers; the binding or release of Ca2+ causes these proteins to switch into an “on” or “off” state in the regulation of effector activity. Many Ca2+-sensing transducers are members of the EF hand superfamily of Ca2+-binding proteins (Moncrief et al., 24.Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. Goodman M. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 522-562Google Scholar), one of the best characterized being calmodulin. In the past few years, a new and rapidly expanding EF hand subfamily has been defined by recoverin and its cognates (Dizhoor et al., 6.Dizhoor A.M. Ray S. Kumar S. Niemi G. Spencer M. Brolley D. Walsh K. Phillipov P.P. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Science. 1991; 251: 915-918Google Scholar; Hurley et al., 8.Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.-K. Olshevskaya E. Sinelnikova V.V. Phillipov P. Hurley J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Google Scholar). Electrophysiological analyses on mammalian recoverin and frog S-modulin reveal that these photoreceptor proteins prolong photoexcitation in high free Ca2+ concentrations (Gray-Keller et al., 11.Gray-Keller M.P. Polans A.S. Palczewski K. Detwiler P.B. Neuron. 1993; 10: 523-531Google Scholar; Kawamura, 117.Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Google Scholar. Accumulated biochemical evidence suggests that recoverin/S-modulin delays photorecovery by preventing rhodopsin kinase from phosphorylating rhodopsin in high Ca2+ conditions (Kawamura et al., 1993; Chen et al., 9.Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25200-25206Google Scholar; Klenchin et al., 19.Klenchin V.A. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16147-16152Google Scholar). Indeed, Chen and co-workers(5.De Castro E. Nef S. Fiumelli H. Lenz S.E. Kawamura S. Nef P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 133-140Google Scholar) have recently found that recoverin directly binds to rhodopsin kinase at high Ca2+ levels. Recoverin is heterogeneously fatty acylated on its amino terminus (Dizhoor et al., 7.Dizhoor A.M. Ericsson L.H. Johnson R.S. Kumar S. Olshevskaya E. Zozulya S. Neubert T.A. Stryer L. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16033-16036Google Scholar), and this posttranslational modification enhances the association of recoverin with membranes in high Ca2+ conditions (Dizhoor et al., 1993). However, the presence of a fatty acyl moiety on recoverin is not necessary for its inhibition of rhodopsin kinase (Chen et al., 1995). Flaherty et al.(10.Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Google Scholar) have shown that the crystallographic structure of recoverin, with Ca2+ bound in its EF3 site, is compact and that the protein is composed of two domains, each having one functional EF hand. The three-dimensional structure of recoverin also reveals the presence of a hydrophobic crevice composed of aromatic and aliphatic amino acid residues distributed in the N-terminal half of the protein that may be involved in interactions with a target factor(s). Interestingly, Polans et al.(27.Polans A.S. Buczylko J. Crabb J. Palczewski K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 981-989Google Scholar) have found that recoverin is an antigen in the autoimmune response of people inflicted with cancer-associated retinopathy, but its role in this degenerative disease is unclear. Numerous vertebrate cognates of recoverin have been identified including visinin (Yamagata et al., 33.Yamagata K. Goto K. Kuo C.-H. Kondo H. Miki N. Neuron. 1990; 2: 469-476Google Scholar), multiple isoforms of neurocalcin (Hidaka and Okazaki, 12.Hidaka H. Okazaki K. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 16: 73-77Google Scholar; Terasawa et al., 32.Terasawa M. Nakano A. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19596-19599Google Scholar), hippocalcin (Kobayashi et al., 20.Kobayashi M. Takamatsu K. Saitoh S. Miura M. Noguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 511-517Google Scholar), and neuronal visinin-related proteins like Vilip (Lenz et al., 23.Lenz S.E. Henschel Y. Zopf D. Voss B. Gundelfinger E.D. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 133-140Google Scholar) and NVPs (Kajimoto et al., 16.Kajimoto Y. Shirai Y. Mukai H. Kuno T. Tanaka C. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1091-1096Google Scholar). Protein sequence comparisons indicate that recoverin, S-modulin, and visinin define a distinct subclass that is expressed in photoreceptor cells. Another subclass of these neuronally expressed Ca2+-binding proteins is comprised of bovine neurocalcin, rat hippocalcin, rat NVPs, and chicken Vilip. The evolutionary diversity of these EF hand recoverin-like proteins is further exemplified by the recent discoveries of yet another subclass defined by GCAP-1 (Palczewski et al., 26.Palczewski K. Subbaraya I. Gorczyca W.A. Helekar B.S. Ruiz C.C. Ohguro H. Huang J. Zhao X. Crabb J.W. Johnson R.S. Walsh K.A. Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Baehr W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 395-404Google Scholar) and GCAP-2 (Dizhoor et al., 25.Okazaki K. Obata N. Inoue S. Idaka H. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 551-555Google Scholar), two mammalian photoreceptor proteins that activate membrane guanylate cyclase when the free Ca2+ levels are low. Two invertebrate homologues of recoverin have been reported to date: Drosophila frequenin and neurocalcin. Pongs et al.(1994) identified frequenin from studies on the Shaker-like V7 mutants of D. melanogaster. They proposed that the overexpression of frequenin in V7 mutants causes the augmented facilitation of neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions. In addition, Pongs et al. reported that recombinant frequenin is capable of activating bovine rod outer segment membrane guanylate cyclase in a Ca2+-dependent manner in vitro, but the in vivo target of frequenin has not been established. In a search for homologues of recoverin in D. melanogaster, we discovered Drosophila neurocalcin (nca), a gene coding for a protein that is 88% identical to the bovine neurocalcin δ isoform on the primary sequence level (Teng et al., 1994). Initial characterization revealed that the Drosophila neurocalcin protein (DrosNCa) is expressed in neurons and that bacterially expressed recombinant DrosNCa could be myristoylated by N-acyl transferase. Here, we present evidences that native DrosNCa is fatty acylated in vivo and that this modification significantly enhances its Ca2+-dependent association with Drosophila membranes. In addition, we have found that at high Ca2+ concentrations in reconstituted assays, both recombinant myristoylated and nonacylated DrosNCa are capable of inhibiting the phosphorylation of bovine rhodopsin by rhodopsin kinase, but the recombinant DrosNCa proteins neither stimulate nor inhibit mammalian photoreceptor membrane guanylate cyclase in high or low Ca2+ conditions. Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B and CNBr-Sepharose were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Protein quantitation reagent, ampholytes, and two-dimensional gel protein standards were obtained from Bio-Rad.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was done according to the protocols of Bio-Rad. Anti-rDrosNCa rabbit antibodies 6094 and 6515 were generated and affinity-purified as described previously (Teng et al., 1994).

Native neurocalcin was purified from Canton-S Drosophila adult heads using an AP6515 antibody affinity column. Fly heads were homogenized at 200 mg of tissue/ml in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded onto an AP6515 column preequilibrated with TCMN buffer (50 mM Tris (pH7.5), 0.1 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.2 mM PMSF). The column was washed with more than 20 volumes of TCMN, followed by 3 volumes of TCMN plus 0.5 M NaCl and a final wash of 3 volumes of TCMN. Proteins bound to the column were eluted with 2-3 volumes of 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.4) and immediately neutralized. The eluted proteins were examined on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and on immunoblots. All fluorescence measurements were performed at 25°C on an SLM 8000C spectrofluorimeter (SLM Aminco, Urbana, IL) using a 1 × 1-cm quartz cuvette containing 1.5 ml of sample extensively mixed. The excitation wavelength was set at 292 nm, and the emission spectrum was recorded from 300 to 410 nm with an emission scan speed of 1 nm/s. The bandwidths were 8 nm for both excitation and emission. The emission spectrum of 1 μM protein in 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 mM KCl, and 1 mM HEDTA was recorded. CaCl2 was then added to the sample to a free Ca2+ concentration of 100 μM, and a second emission spectrum was recorded. Background fluorescence of the buffer in the absence of protein was subtracted from all of the spectra. Wild type Canton-S adult Drosophila heads were homogenized at 100 mg/ml in 10 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM PMSF, 5 mM β-ME, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin containing either 2 mM EGTA or 0.2 mM CaCl2. Each homogenate was placed on ice for 10 min and then spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min, 4°C. The resulting supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed on immunoblot probed with AP6094 antibodies. Crude membranes were prepared from Canton-S Drosophila adult heads according to the method of Kobayashi et al.(21.Kobayashi M. Takamatsu K. Saitoh S. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18898-18904Google Scholar). 200 ng of myr-rDrosNCa or non-rDrosNCa was reconstituted with 25 μl of membranes at 10 mg of protein/ml in membrane binding buffer (MBB; 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 M KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM PMSF, 5 mM β-ME, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) containing either 1 mM EGTA or 0.2 mM CaCl2. The suspensions were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min, 4°C. The supernatant and particulate fractions were analyzed as described above for native DrosNCa. Rhodopsin kinase (RK) was affinity-purified from Sf9 cell extracts as described in Chen et al.(1995) with modifications. The RK eluate was dialyzed against Tris-HCl 20 mM (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2. The purified enzyme was examined by SDS-PAGE and estimated to be more than 90% pure. The concentration of the protein was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Urea-washed rod outer segment membranes were prepared as described in Chen et al.(1995). The phosphorylation assay was performed according to the procedures of Chen et al.(1995) with some modifications. Purified recombinant RK and urea-washed membranes were mixed in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) under infrared illumination and kept on ice. Thirty seconds before a light flash that bleached 0.05% of rhodopsin, 5 μl of the RK-rod outer segment suspension was added to 5 μl of TCMN buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (800 dpm/pmol) and rDrosNCa or rBovRv. The final concentrations of rhodopsin, RK, and ATP were 20 μM, 200 nM, and 500 μM, respectively. The reaction was incubated for 60 min in the dark at room temperature and stopped by adding an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Reactions unexposed to light were used as dark controls. Each reaction was fractionated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. Rhodopsin bands were excised and counted. To quantify light-dependent phosphorylation, dark controls were substracted from the test samples. To investigate and compare the biochemical properties of the fatty acylated and unmodified forms of DrosNCa, milligram quantities of myr-rDrosNCa and non-rDrosNCa were expressed in E. coli and subsequently purified. The masses of myr-rDrosNCa and non-rDrosNCa were 21,975.51 and 21,764.17 Da, respectively, as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry, and are consistent with the calculated masses of acylated and unmodified polypeptide products of the nca gene. The isolated proteins were examined by native and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under native conditions (Fig. 1A), the Ca2+-free (EGTA) forms of the two proteins migrated faster than their Ca2+-bound forms, and myr-rDrosNCa (m) migrated further than non-rDrosNCa (n). As shown in Fig. 1B, in denaturing SDS-PAGE conditions with the addition of β-ME, both proteins resolved as single bands that migrated more slowly in the absence of Ca2+ than in its presence, and myr-rDrosNCa was slightly faster than non-rDrosNCa. When myr-rDrosNCa and non-rDrosNCa were subjected to SDS-PAGE without β-mercaptoethanol, the formation of dimers was detected (Fig. 1C). Under these nonreducing conditions, multiple forms of monomeric (arrows) and dimeric (arrowhead) DrosNCa were observed, and their mobilities differed from those of the β-ME-treated proteins (Fig. 1B). Considering that three cysteine residues are present in DrosNCa, these results suggest that rDrosNCa can form intra- and/or intermolecular disulfide bonds. Curiously, the distribution of the monomeric and dimeric species for myr- and non-rDrosNCa were different, suggesting that lipid modification could influence the formation of the disulfide linkages. DrosNCa, like bovine neurocalcin, has two tryptophan residues located at positions 30 and 103 in EF1 and EF3, respectively (Teng et al., 1994); these two tryptophans are conserved throughout the recoverin family. The fluorescence change of myr-rDrosNCa upon binding Ca2+ is very similar to the change observed for myristoylated recombinant bovine neurocalcin δ (Ladant, 22.Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3179-3185Google Scholar). Compared with the Ca2+ free form (HEDTA), the maximum fluorescence intensity of myr-rDrosNCa in 0.1 mM free Ca2+ was approximately 2-fold higher, but the emission maximum of 335 nm was not significantly different (Fig. 2A). This change in the amplitude of the signal was reversible and appeared to be Ca2+-specific because MgCl2 did not induce any variation in the fluorescence spectrum of the protein (data not shown). The fluorescence of myr-rDrosNCa in its Ca2+-bound form was similar that of non-rDrosNCa. However, unlike myr-rDrosNCa, non-rDrosNCa did not show a substantial increase in fluorescence upon Ca2+ binding (Fig. 2B), even when up to 1 mM free Ca2+ was added (data not shown). In contrast, nonacylated bovine neurocalcin δ has been reported to undergo a 1.5-fold increase of its fluorescence when it binds Ca2+ (Ladant, 1995). From these data, we infer that the Ca2+-induced variation of the fluorescence of myr-rDrosNCa is mainly due to a change in the position of its myristoyl group, which influences the environment of one or more of its tryptophan residues. We have previously shown that recombinant DrosNCa can be myristoylated by N-myristoyl transferase (Teng et al., 1994). Since lipid modification has yet not been demonstrated to occur on Drosophila proteins, we wondered if native DrosNCa was acylated. To address this issue, we purified the protein from wild type Canton-S Drosophila adult head extracts by affinity chromatography using a column of affinity-purified AP6515 anti-rDrosNCa antibodies. Fig. 3A shows a sample of the fly head extract (lane 2) that was loaded onto the antibody column and the proteins recovered in the low pH elution (lane 3). A band was detected in the eluted fraction that migrated with an apparent mass of 22 kDa, the expected size for DrosNCa. To ascertain that the eluted 22-kDa band was native DrosNCa, we performed Western blot analyses using AP6094, a different affinity-purified anti-rDrosNCa antibody. Fig. 3B shows that the 22-kDa protein was recognized by AP6094 (lane 3) but not detected by the mouse anti-rabbit secondary antibodies alone (data not shown) and that it was depleted from the flow-through fraction after passage over the AP6515-Sepharose column (lane 2). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed to determine if native DrosNCa behaved like myr-rDrosNCa or non-rDrosNCa. As shown in Fig. 4A, myr-rDrosNCa resolved at a more acidic pH relative to non-rDrosNCa in the IEF dimension, and myr-rDrosNCa migrated slightly faster than non-rDrosNCa in the SDS-PAGE dimension as previously observed in Fig. 1. We found that in IEF gels having different gradients of ampholytes, myr-rDrosNCa consistently resolved at a more acidic pH relative to the 5.2 pI, 45-kDa standard (arrow), whereas non-rDrosNCa settled at a more basic pH. This result is consistent with the fact that a fatty acyl modification on DrosNCa results in the loss of one positive charge in the α-amine group of the N-terminal glycine residue. The apparent pI values of both rDrosNCa proteins are close to the calculated pI of 5.1 for the deduced nca polypeptide product. Previously, we had reported that AP6094 weakly cross-reacted to rat hippocalcin. This observation raised the possibility that these antibodies would detect homologues or different isoforms of DrosNCa in fly preparations. We therefore performed Western analysis on proteins extracted from Drosophila adult heads that had been separated on a two-dimensional gel. As shown in Fig. 4B, only one spot was recognized by AP6094 in the immunoblot. Under these two-dimensional gel conditions, rat hippocalcin was clearly separated from myr-rDrosNCa and non-rDrosNCa (data not shown). Thus, these data suggest that AP6094 specifically recognizes a single antigen in Drosophila adult heads, that being native DrosNCa. To ascertain if the gel mobility of purified native DrosNCa was similar to either myr-rDrosNCa or non-rDrosNCa, mixtures of equivalent quantities of native and recombinant DrosNCa were separated on two-dimensional gels, transblotted, and probed with AP6094. Whereas non-rDrosNCa and the native protein resolved as two distinct spots (Fig. 4C), the immunoblot signal for myr-rDrosNCa and the native protein comigrated (Fig. 4D). From these results, we infer that DrosNCa is fatty acylated in vivo. Studies on recoverin (Dizhoor et al., 1993), hippocalcin (Kobayashi et al., 1993), and bovine neurocalcin δ (Ladant, 1995) have shown that the fatty acylated forms of these two proteins bind to membranes in high Ca2+ concentrations. To determine if native DrosNCa undergoes Ca2+-dependent translocation, Canton-S adult heads were homogenized in 10 mM NaCl, Tris buffer with either 1 mM CaCl2 or 2 mM EGTA and partitioned by centrifugation, and the resulting pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed on immunoblots using AP6094 (Fig. 5A). In the presence of Ca2+, almost all of DrosNCa was found in the pellet, whereas 70% of the protein was present in the soluble fraction in the presence of EGTA. When a similar experiment was done using 100 mM NaCl, Tris buffer with EGTA, only 40% of DrosNCa was found in the supernatant (data not shown). The data reveal that native DrosNCa binds to membranes and/or cytoskeleton when the levels of free Ca2+ are high and that its affinity for membranes increases with the ionic strength of its solvent environment. The translocation properties of DrosNCa are therefore similar to those of recoverin, hippocalcin, and bovine neurocalcin δ. The involvement of the fatty acyl moiety of DrosNCa in translocation was investigated by comparing the membrane binding abilities of myr-rDrosNCa and non-rDrosNCa. Briefly, recombinant protein was reconstituted with washed Drosophila head membranes and centrifuged. The resulting pellet and supernatant fractions were examined by Western analysis (Fig. 5B). In the presence of 0.2 mM CaCl2, most of the myr-rDrosNCa was located in the pellet, whereas it was almost completely soluble in the presence of EGTA. In contrast, non-rDrosNCa was always found in the supernatant in the presence or absence of Ca2+. These results show that the association of recombinant DrosNCa to the particulate fraction is dependent on its fatty acyl modification. It has been shown that recoverin inhibits the in vitro phosphorylation of rhodopsin by rhodopsin kinase (Kawamura et al., 18.Kawamura S. Hisatomi O. Kayada S. Tokunaga F. Kuo C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14579-14582Google Scholar; Chen et al., 1995; Klenchin et al., 1995) and that recoverin directly interacts with rhodopsin kinase in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Chen et al., 1995). Since the primary sequences of DrosNCa and BovRv are 54% identical and the two proteins have similar Ca2+-dependent membrane binding properties, we examined if DrosNCa can affect rhodopsin phosphorylation in vitro. Urea-washed bovine rod outer segment membranes were reconstituted with purified recombinant bovine rhodopsin kinase in the presence or absence of myr- or non-rDrosNCa, and light-dependent rhodopsin phosphorylation was analyzed. When 5 μM of non- or myr-rDrosNCa were added in the assays, an inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation was observed in 0.1 mM Ca2+ but not in the presence of 1 mM EGTA (Fig. 6A); 65 and 85% inhibitions were observed for nonacylated and myristoylated proteins, respectively, at 0.1 mM Ca2+. To analyze the potency of the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation by DrosNCa, we compared the activity of non- and myr-rDrosNCa to those of non- and myr-rBovRv. Increasing concentrations of the recombinant myristoylated or nonacylated forms of DrosNCa or BovRv were added to reactions in the presence of 0.1 mM Ca2+, and the percentage of inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation was determined. Surprisingly, DrosNCa showed inhibitory effect similar to that of BovRv. The plots of both myristoylated (closed squares) and nonacylated (open squares) DrosNCa were basically superimposed with those of myristoylated (closed circles) and nonacylated (open circles) BovRv, respectively (Fig. 6B). The EC50 values were approximately 0.8 μM for the myristoylated proteins and 4 μM for the nonacylated proteins. We wanted to determine if the inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation was an activity exhibited by other Ca2+-binding proteins related to recoverin and neurocalcin. We therefore examined the inhibitory activities of two other EF hand proteins: myristoylated recombinant GCAP-2, which has 29 and 38% identities with recoverin and neurocalcin, respectively; and calmodulin, which has 19 and 22% identities with recoverin and neurocalcin, respectively. In our reconstituted assays, both myr-rGCAP-2 and calmodulin displayed only weak inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). In this paper, we present two lines of evidence indicating that Drosophila neurocalcin is a Ca2+-binding protein that is fatty acylated in vivo. First, on two-dimensional gels, native DrosNCa comigrates with myristoylated rDrosNCa and is distinctly separated from nonacylated rDrosNCa. Second, the membrane binding properties of native DrosNCa are similar to those of myr-rDrosNCa; both proteins bind to membranes in high Ca2+ conditions and become more soluble when free Ca2+ levels decrease. This study therefore provides the first evidence of the existence of protein acylation in Drosophila. Definitive elucidation of the type of lipid modification(s) on DrosNCa in vivo will have to be obtained by mass spectrometry analyses. The Ca2+-dependent membrane association ability of rDrosNCa is greatly enhanced by fatty acylation. It is likely that DrosNCa translocation occurs by the Ca2+-myristoyl switch mechanism that has been proposed for recoverin (Zozulya and Stryer, 34.Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Google Scholar; Dizhoor et al., 1993; Hughes et al., 13.Hughes R.E. Brzovic P.S. Klevit R.E. Hurley J.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11410-11416Google Scholar; Tanaka et al., 30.Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Google Scholar). In this model, the fatty acyl moiety of the Ca2+-free form of the protein resides in a hydrophobic pocket composed of aromatic and aliphatic amino acid residues distributed in the N-terminal half of the protein. The binding of Ca2+ to recoverin induces the extrusion of its lipid moiety and N-terminal α-helix into solution, thereby unmasking the hydrophobic pocket; this conformation favors interactions with membranes, cytoskeleton, and/or a target factor(s). The fluorescence of rDrosNCa in the presence and absence of Ca2+ is consistent with the Ca2+-myristoyl switch model. First, the variation of fluorescence of myr-rDrosNCa seems to be mainly due to a movement of its myristoyl group, since no major fluorescence change occurs upon Ca2+-binding to non-acylated rDrosNCa. Second, the fluorescence of myr-rDrosNCa in its Ca2+-bound form is very similar to that of the protein lacking the myristoyl modification. Taken together, these observations suggest that the observed fluorescence change of myr-rDrosNCa upon Ca2+ binding is due to the movement of its fatty acyl moiety from a protein environment into solution. Like calmodulin, recoverin and its homologues appear to have descended from a common ancestor that had four EF hand sites. All of the recoverin-like proteins identified to date have sequence determinants in their N termini necessary for fatty acylation, a modification that appears to be important for their Ca2+-dependent translocation properties. The discovery of multiple subclasses of neuronal recoverin-like proteins suggest that these cognates perform specialized cellular functions. Several of these cognates are coexpressed in a given neuron. These EF hand proteins have varying affinities for Ca2+ (Cox et al., 4.Cox J.A. Durussel I. Comte M. Nef S. Nef P. Lenz S.E. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32807-32813Google Scholar; Ladant, 1995; Chen et al., 1995; Klenchin et al., 1995; Palczewski et al., 1994; Dizhoor et al., 1995), suggesting that their regulatory activities would be performed in different ranges of Ca2+ concentrations. It has been proposed that recoverin and S-modulin delay photorecovery by inhibiting the receptor-quenching activity of rhodopsin kinase at high Ca2+ levels (Kawamura et al., 1993; Chen et al., 1995; Klenchin et al., 1995). In contrast, GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 appear to promote photorecovery by stimulating membrane guanylate cyclase at low Ca2+ concentrations (Palczewski et al., 1994; Dizhoor et al., 1995). Drosophila frequenin has been reported to stimulate bovine photoreceptor membrane guanylate cyclase in low Ca2+ conditions (Pongs et al., 1994); however, DrosNCa does not exhibit this activity in similar in vitro assays. 2A. Dizhoor, personal communication. In this paper, we report that DrosNCa is capable of inhibiting the phosphorylation of bleached rhodopsin in reconstituted assays in a Ca2+-dependent manner. We show that its potency is similar to that of recoverin and that its inhibitory activity, like that of recoverin, is enhanced by myristoylation. Our results on BovRv are in agreement with the findings of Chen et al.(1995) but in contrast to Calvert et al.(1.Calvert P.D. Klenchin V.A. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24127-24129Google Scholar), who report that myristoylated and nonacylated BovRv have similar inhibitory potencies. It seems plausible that differences between our experimental procedures and those of Calvert et al. may account for the discrepancies in results. Three experimental differences stand out in particular: (i) in Calvert et al., 100% of the rhodopsin was bleached during the experiment, whereas we bleached only 0.05% of the rhodopsin; (ii) we used recombinant rhodopsin kinase that is produced using the baculovirus-Sf9 expression system, whereas Calvert et al. extracted the enzyme from bovine photoreceptors; and (iii), the methods of purifying rhodopsin kinase differed, e.g. the rhodopsin kinase preparations of Calvert et al. included transducin, arrestin, and 0.4% Tween 20, whereas our protein preparations were highly purified and did not contain detergent. We have found that detergent can interfere with the Ca2+-dependent association of rhodopsin kinase and recoverin. 3C.-K. Chen, unpublished observations. Although our experiments do not explore the mechanism by which DrosNCa inhibits rhodopsin phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase, the similarity between the inhibitory effects of DrosNCa and recoverin suggests that these two proteins act through the same mechanism(s). It has been shown that recoverin and rhodopsin kinase associate in a Ca2+-dependent manner and that this interaction is required for the inhibitory effect of recoverin on rhodopsin phosphorylation (Chen et al., 1995). One might therefore postulate that a direct interaction between DrosNCa and rhodopsin kinase is necessary for the inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation by DrosNCa. Further investigations are required to test this hypothesis. Ca2+-dependent inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation has also been observed using another recoverin cognate, hippocalcin,3 but other recoverin-related proteins like GCAP-2 or the more distant calmodulin are only poor inhibitors in these phosphorylation assays. As such, the capacity of in vitro inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation appears to be a newly discovered property of a subset of recoverin-like proteins including recoverin, neurocalcin, and hippocalcin. This is further supported by recent evidence that neuronal recoverin-like proteins of the neuronal calcium sensor family inhibit in vitro phosphorylation of rhodopsin (De Castro et al., 1995). Rhodopsin kinase belongs to a subfamily of serine/threonine kinases that desensitize activated seven-transmembrane receptors involved in signal transduction. Cognates of rhodopsin kinase include mammalian βARK1, βARK2, and G protein-coupled receptor kinases 4-6, as well as Drosophila G protein-coupled receptor kinases 1-4 (Cassill et al., 2.Cassill J.A. Whitney M. Joazeiro C.A. Becker A. Zuker C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11067-11070Google Scholar; Inglese et al., 15.Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Google Scholar). Given that recoverin-like proteins colocalize with homologues of rhodopsin kinase in neuronal tissues and that several cognates of recoverin inhibit rhodopsin phosphorylation in a Ca2+-sensitive manner, it is tempting to speculate that members of these two protein subfamilies interact to confer Ca2+-dependent attenuation to seven-transmembrane receptor quenching events. However, at least two issues raise questions about the ability of recoverin-like proteins to control receptor activity in vivo. First, recoverin and its cognates appear to be exclusively expressed in neuronal tissues, whereas GRKs and seven-transmembrane receptors are present in non-neuronal cells as well. Second, the documented data on the inhibitory effects of recoverin and its cognates are based on in vitro studies using mammalian rhodopsin kinase. If the recoverin and rhodopsin kinase subfamilies interact as proposed, one should be able to demonstrate that recoverin-like proteins also inhibit βARK1, βARK2, and/or G protein-coupled receptor kinases 4-6. So far, Chen et al.(1995) have found that recoverin cannot inhibit βARK1 in reconstituted assays. Neuronal signaling is attenuated by mechanisms involving the universal second messenger Ca2+. Recoverin and its homologues probably function as Ca2+-sensing regulators in neuronal processes, but their precise mode(s) of action remains unresolved. It is plausible that each recoverin-like protein differentially controls a receptor kinase. Alternatively, it is conceivable that these EF hand proteins, like calmodulin, may interact with multiple targets. Indeed, multiple proteins have been reported to associate with recoverin and neurocalcin in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Chen et al., 1995; Okazaki et al., 1995). Further studies are therefore required to elucidate the physiological roles of this diverse class of Ca2+-binding proteins. We are indebted to Robert Hughes and Alexander Dizhoor for providing myristoylated recombinant GCAP-2. We are grateful to Lowell Erickson, Thomas Neubert, and Richard Johnson for performing mass spectrometry analyses and to William Atkins for helping with fluorescence analyses.

https://openalex.org/W2017599051,"Sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs) are non-enzymatic glycoproteins required for lysosomal degradation of various sphingolipids with short oligosaccharide chains by their respective exohydrolases. Four of these (SAP-A to SAP-D or saposins A to D) are derived from a common precursor by proteolytic processing. Alternative splicing of the SAP-precursor gene results in insertion of additional 6 or 9 bases of exon 8′ or 8, respectively, into the SAP-B coding region of the transcribed mRNAs.To examine the features of the three different SAP-precursor proteins (prosaposins), the respective cDNAs were stably expressed in baby hamster kidney cells. Pulse-chase experiments with transfected cells and endocytosis studies on human fibroblasts showed that synthesis, transport, and maturation of all SAP-precursor led to formation of the four mature SAPs (SAP-A to SAP-D).In order to determine the biological function of the three different SAP-B isoforms, SAP-precursor-deficient human fibroblasts were loaded with recombinant SAP-precursor proteins with or without 2- and 3-amino acid insertions, respectively, purified from the medium of the baby hamster kidney cells. They were found to stimulate at nanomolar concentrations the turnover of biosynthetically labeled ceramide, glucosylceramide, and lactosylceramide. Since the physiological function of SAP-B is to stimulate the degradation of sulfatide by arylsulfatase A (EC 3.1.6.1) and globotriaosylceramide by β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) loading studies with the respective exogenously labeled lipids on SAP-precursor-deficient fibroblasts were performed. Addition of different purified SAP-precursors to the medium of the lipid-loaded fibroblasts showed positive stimulation of the lipid degradation by all three SAP-B isoforms derived from the SAP-precursors. These findings establish that all three forms of the SAP-B can function as sulfatide/globotriaosylceramide activator. Sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs) are non-enzymatic glycoproteins required for lysosomal degradation of various sphingolipids with short oligosaccharide chains by their respective exohydrolases. Four of these (SAP-A to SAP-D or saposins A to D) are derived from a common precursor by proteolytic processing. Alternative splicing of the SAP-precursor gene results in insertion of additional 6 or 9 bases of exon 8′ or 8, respectively, into the SAP-B coding region of the transcribed mRNAs. To examine the features of the three different SAP-precursor proteins (prosaposins), the respective cDNAs were stably expressed in baby hamster kidney cells. Pulse-chase experiments with transfected cells and endocytosis studies on human fibroblasts showed that synthesis, transport, and maturation of all SAP-precursor led to formation of the four mature SAPs (SAP-A to SAP-D). In order to determine the biological function of the three different SAP-B isoforms, SAP-precursor-deficient human fibroblasts were loaded with recombinant SAP-precursor proteins with or without 2- and 3-amino acid insertions, respectively, purified from the medium of the baby hamster kidney cells. They were found to stimulate at nanomolar concentrations the turnover of biosynthetically labeled ceramide, glucosylceramide, and lactosylceramide. Since the physiological function of SAP-B is to stimulate the degradation of sulfatide by arylsulfatase A (EC 3.1.6.1) and globotriaosylceramide by β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) loading studies with the respective exogenously labeled lipids on SAP-precursor-deficient fibroblasts were performed. Addition of different purified SAP-precursors to the medium of the lipid-loaded fibroblasts showed positive stimulation of the lipid degradation by all three SAP-B isoforms derived from the SAP-precursors. These findings establish that all three forms of the SAP-B can function as sulfatide/globotriaosylceramide activator. INTRODUCTIONThe physiological degradation of glycosphingolipids with short oligosaccharide chains is catalyzed by lysosomal exohydrolases in the presence of small, heat-stable glycoproteins, so called sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs) ( 1The abbreviations used are: SAPsphingolipid activator proteinpBHE0pBHE6, and pBHE9, expression plasmid pBHE containing the human prosaposin cDNA without additional base pairs, with 6 base pairs, or 9 base pairs, respectivelyBHK cellsbaby hamster kidney cellsSAP-precursor0SAP-precursor6, and SAP-precursor9, proteins (SAP-precursor, 46- and 30 kDa-protein forms) purified from the medium of transfected BHK cellsMEMminimal essential mediumFCSfetal calf serumEndo Hendo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase HCerceramide, N-acylsphingosineGlcCerglucosylceramide, Glcβ1-1CergalactosylceramideGalβ1-1CerLacCer, lactosylceramideGalβ1-4Glcβ1-1CerdigalactosylceramideGalα1-4Galβ1-1CersulfatideGal(3-sulfate)β1-1CerELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The abbreviated designations of the gangliosides are according to Svennerholm's nomenclature for ganglio series gangliosides (SvennerholmL.(1963) J. Neurochem.10, 613-623). To date there are different nomenclatures used throughout the literature for the sphingolipid activator proteins and their precursor protein: sphingolipid activator protein precursor = prosaposin or SAP-precursorsphingolipid activator proteins A-D: saposin A = SAP-A, saposin B = SAP-B, saposin C = SAP-C, and saposin D = SAP-D. In this article we use the designation SAP-precursor, SAP-A, SAP-B, SAP-Cand SAP-D for the corresponding proteins.) or saposins(1.Sandhoff K. Harzer K. F ü rst W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2427-2441Google Scholar). Four of the five known activator proteins (SAP-A to SAP-D or saposins A-D) are derived from a common precursor polypeptide by proteolytic processing(2.Fürst W. Machleidt W. Sandhoff K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 317-328Google Scholar, 3.O'Brien J.S. Kretz K.A. Dewji N. Wenger D.A. Esch F. Fluharty A.L. Science. 1988; 241: 1098-1101Google Scholar). This precursor also called prosaposin was identified as a protein of 68 kDa in human skin fibroblasts by studying the synthesis and processing of SAP-C(4.Fujibayashi S. Wenger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15339-15343Google Scholar). After modification of its N-linked oligosaccharides in the Golgi apparatus, a 73-kDa form is secreted into the culture medium. Processing to the mature polypeptides of 8-13 kDa takes place after the transport of the precursor to the acidic organelles of the cells.Although different activating properties for the SAPs (SAP-A to SAP-D) have been described, their physiological relevance has been established only for SAP-B and SAP-C(1.Sandhoff K. Harzer K. F ü rst W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2427-2441Google Scholar). The absence of SAP-C in human patients with Gaucher disease shows the relevance of this activator protein for the degradation of glucosylceramide by glucosylceramidase (EC 3.2.1.45) (1.Sandhoff K. Harzer K. F ü rst W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2427-2441Google Scholar, 5.Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Google Scholar). While SAP-A is known to stimulate the breakdown of several glycosphingolipids in vitro(6.Tayama M. Soeda S. Kishimoto Y. Martin B.M. Callahan J.W. Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 401-404Google Scholar, 7.Morimoto S. Martin B.M. Yamamoto Y. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3389-3393Google Scholar), SAP-D has recently been shown to be involved in ceramide degradation in vivo(8.Klein A. Henseler M. Klein C. Suzuki K. Harzer K. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1440-1448Google Scholar). This was established in an in vivo test system, in which the breakdown of [14C]serine-labeled sphingolipids accumulating in human fibroblasts derived from patients with SAP-precursor deficiency (9.Schnabel D. Schröder M. Fürst W. Klein A. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Weber J. Harzer K. Paton B.C. Poulos A. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3312-3315Google Scholar) was stimulated by addition of different SAPs (SAP-A to SAP-D) to the culture medium.SAP-B itself has capacity to bind several sphingolipids, but its genetic defect leads to an accumulation of sulfatides, globotriaosylceramide, digalactosylceramide, and ganglioside GM3 in a disorder classified as metachromatic leukodystrophy(1.Sandhoff K. Harzer K. F ü rst W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2427-2441Google Scholar, 10.Fluharty A.L. Trends Genet. 1995; 7: 167-189Google Scholar).The SAP-precursor gene localized on the long arm of human chromosome 10 (10q21-22) (11.Kao F.-T. Law M.L. Hartz J. Jones C. Zhang X.-L. Dewji N. O'Brien J.S. Wenger D.A. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 685-688Google Scholar) consists of at least 15 exons, four of which (exon 6-9) code for SAP-B. Exon 8 consists of only 9 base pairs (12.Holtschmidt H. Sandhoff K. Fürst W. Kwon H.Y. Schnabel D. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 267-270Google Scholar) and can be spliced differentially, generating three different cDNAs(13.Nakano T. Sandhoff K. Stümper J. Christomanou H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 152-154Google Scholar, 14.Holtschmidt H. Sandhoff K. Kwon H.Y. Harzer K. Nakano T. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7556-7560Google Scholar): one containing all 9 bases of exon 8, one containing the downstream 6 bases of exon 8 (also called exon 8′) and one completely lacking this exon (Fig. 1). At the protein level, only SAP-B without the amino acids derived from exon 8 has been detected so far(10.Fluharty A.L. Trends Genet. 1995; 7: 167-189Google Scholar, 15.Fürst W. Schubert J. Machleidt W. Meyer H.E. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 709-714Google Scholar). A recent report shows a differential tissue distribution of the mRNAs with or without exon 8 in different cell lines or tissues(16.Lamontagne S. Portier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20528-20532Google Scholar). The multiple mRNA species were also detected in the mouse(17.Tsuda H. Sakiyama T. Endo H. Kitagawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1266-1272Google Scholar). These findings prompt the question whether the different sequences within the SAP-B domain in the SAP-precursor have any biological significance. In the present report we describe the expression and processing of the three SAP-precursor forms in BHK cells stably transfected with the respective cDNAs. In addition, the stimulation of sulfatide and globotriaosylceramide degradation by the three SAP-B isoforms was tested in vivo in a cell culture system by adding purified recombinant precursor proteins (designated as SAP-precursor 0, 6, or 9) to the medium of lipid loaded human SAP-precursor-deficient fibroblasts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRestriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Federal Republic of Germany), Life Technologies, Inc.

Protein A-Sepharose was obtained from Sigma, and protein G-agarose was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Bad Soden, Federal Republic of Germany).All other commercially available materials were obtained from the following suppliers: Sigma, Merck (Darmstadt, Federal Republic of Germany), Pharmacia LKB Biotechnologies (Freiburg, Federal Republic of Germany), and New England Biolabs.[3H]Sulfatide, which was labeled in the sphingoid moiety, and [3H]globotriaosylceramide labeled in the terminal galactosyl residue were synthesized in our laboratory according to published procedures(18.Schwarzmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 529: 106-114Google Scholar, 19.Suzuki Y. Suzuki K. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 680-686Google Scholar).AntiseraHuman SAP-A and SAP-C were purified from spleen of a Gaucher patient essentially as described earlier(8.Klein A. Henseler M. Klein C. Suzuki K. Harzer K. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1440-1448Google Scholar, 20.Sano A. Radin N.S. Johnson L.L. Tarr G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19597-19601Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-SAP-A and anti-SAP-C antisera were raised in rabbits by injection of 100 μg of pure protein in combination with Freund's complete adjuvant followed by three booster injections of 100 μg protein each in Freund's incomplete adjuvant given in 4-week intervals. The animals were bled 10 days after the final injection. The antisera had ELISA titer of 1:950 and 1:900 (half-maximal A405 of 3-fold serum dilutions on a 50-ng antigen coat) against SAP-A and SAP-C, respectively. Specificity of the antisera was assessed by ELISA, immunoblot and immunoprecipitation, and in the case of the anti-SAP-C antiserum by comparison with the rabbit anti-SAP-C antiserum described earlier(21.Christomanou H. Aignesberger A. Linke R.P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1986; 367: 879-890Google Scholar).The preparation of the goat anti-SAP-B and anti-SAP-D antisera has been described earlier(8.Klein A. Henseler M. Klein C. Suzuki K. Harzer K. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1440-1448Google Scholar).Cells and Cell CultureHuman skin fibroblasts and baby hamster kidney cells (BHK 21 ATCC CCC 10) were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics, 4.5 mM NaHCO3 and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) as described previously(22.Weitz G. Lindl T. Hinrichs U. Sandhoff K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1983; 364: 862-871Google Scholar). Transfected BHK cells were routinely cultured in medium additionally supplemented with 5 μg/ml puromycin. The fibroblasts from a SAP-precursor deficient human fetus have been described earlier(9.Schnabel D. Schröder M. Fürst W. Klein A. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Weber J. Harzer K. Paton B.C. Poulos A. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3312-3315Google Scholar, 23.Harzer K. Paton B.C. Poulos A. Kustermann-Kuhn B. Roggendorf W. Grisar T. Popp M. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1989; 149: 31-39Google Scholar, 24.Bradová V. Smid F. Ulrich-Bott B. Roggendorf W. Paton B.C. Harzer K. Hum. Genet. 1993; 92: 143-152Google Scholar).Expression of the SAP-precursor Proteins in BHK CellsThe expression plasmid pBHE9 was constructed by placing the entire SAP-precursor cDNA (from nucleotide −9 to 1597, numbered from A of the ATG initiation codon) which contained the 9 base pairs of exon 8 into the XbaI and SmaI site downstream of the SV40 early promoter in the expression vector pBHE(25.Artelt P. Morelle C. Ausmeier M. Fitzek M. Hauser H. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 213-219Google Scholar). The expression plasmid pBHE0 containing the SAP-precursor cDNA without exon 8 and the expression plasmid pBHE6 containing the cDNA with the 6 bases of exon 8′ were constructed by replacing nucleotides 543 to 797 (using the Bsu36I and BglII restriction sites on the precursor cDNAs) in the expression plasmid pBHE9 by the respective cDNA segments of the other SAP-precursor cDNAs. These cDNA segments were derived from partial cDNAs obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of total RNA isolated from human fibroblasts(9.Schnabel D. Schröder M. Fürst W. Klein A. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Weber J. Harzer K. Paton B.C. Poulos A. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3312-3315Google Scholar). The correct cDNA sequence of each expression plasmids pBHE0, pBHE6, and pBHE9 was confirmed by DNA sequencing (26.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar).Stably transfected BHK cells were obtained by cotransfection of the expression plasmids and of the plasmids pSV2 pac and pSV2 neo conferring resistance to puromycin and G418 sulfate to the cells(27.Vara J.A. Portela A. Ortin J. Jimenez A. Nuleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4617-4624Google Scholar), as described previously(28.Wirth M. Bode J. Zettlmeissel G. Hauser H. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 419-426Google Scholar). BHK cells transfected only with the expression plasmid pBHE were used as control.Processing and Endocytosis StudiesConfluent cultures of transfected BHK cells in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks were incubated for 1 h in 1 ml of methionine-free modified Eagle's medium (MEM) containing 4% dialyzed and heat-inactivated FCS. The cells were labeled by incubation in 0.7 ml of this medium supplemented with 1.85 MBq of L-[35S]methionine (specific radioactivity > 37 TBq/mmol) for 1 h. The chase periods were started by addition of unlabeled methionine (final concentration 10 mM). For endocytosis studies, 0.7 ml of medium from transfected BHK cells labeled for 5 h with 2.5 MBq of L-[35S]methionine was added to 1.3 ml of culture medium of human SAP-precursor-deficient fibroblasts and the media were supplemented with unlabeled methionine to a final concentration of 10 mM. The fibroblasts were maintained for 24 h in this medium.Cell extracts were prepared with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM pepstatin A and leupeptin each. Immunoprecipitations using the corresponding anti-SAP-antisera were performed as described previously(9.Schnabel D. Schröder M. Fürst W. Klein A. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Weber J. Harzer K. Paton B.C. Poulos A. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3312-3315Google Scholar). Deglycosylation of the precipitated proteins with peptide-N-glycanase F and Endo H was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using gradient gels (7-17%). The gels were impregnated with Amplify for fluorography and exposed to the Kodak X-Omat AR film.Isolation and Purification of Recombinant SAP-precursor ProteinsThe three different SAP-precursor differing in the additional amino acids encoded by exon 8 or 8′ were purified from the medium (Dif 1000-medium, 0.1% FCS) of the BHK cells transfected with the corresponding cDNA according to published procedures(29.Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. Galdzicka M. Fluharty A.L. Ginns E.I. Martin B.M Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 110-116Google Scholar). The purification of the proteins was monitored by immunoblotting and ELISA.Metabolic Labeling of Sphingolipids by [14C]SerineHuman fibroblasts were preincubated for 24 h with MEM containing 0.6% FCS and SAP-precursor 0, 6, or 9 as indicated. Subsequently the medium was exchanged against medium supplemented with 0.3% FCS and [14C]serine (1 μCi/ml medium, 54 Ci/mol). After 24 h the medium was removed and replaced by a medium containing L-serine (185 nmol/ml medium), 0.6% FCS, and the same concentrations of the SAP-precursor 0, 6, or 9 as during the preincubation period. After 120 h of chase the cells were harvested by trypsinization.Sulfatide- and Globotriaosylceramide Loading StudiesSulfatide and globotriaosylceramide loading studies were performed by modifications of published procedures(30.Kudoh T. Wenger D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 89-97Google Scholar, 31.Paton B.C. Schmid B. Kustermann-Kuhn B. Poulos A. Harzer K. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 481-488Google Scholar). In brief, the fibroblasts were preincubated for 24 h with MEM containing 10% FCS and the purified SAP-precursor 0, 6, or 9 (0.5 mg/ml medium) as indicated. Then the medium was exchanged with MEM supplemented with 10% FCS and [3H]sulfatide (3.3 nmol/ml medium, 86 Ci/mol) or [3H]globotriaosylceramide (1.35 nmol/ml medium, 180 Ci/mol). After 48 h of loading, the cells were incubated for additional 120 h in MEM containing the same supplements as during the preincubation period. Subsequently the cells were harvested by trypsinization.Isolation of Cellular SphingolipidsCellular sphingolipids were isolated and identified as described previously(8.Klein A. Henseler M. Klein C. Suzuki K. Harzer K. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1440-1448Google Scholar). In brief, the lipids were extracted from the cell pellets with 7 ml of chloroform/methanol/water/pyridine (60:160:6:1 by volume) for 24 h at 50°C. Phospholipids were degraded by mild alkaline hydrolysis with methanolic NaOH (50 mM) for 2 h at 37°C. Then, the lipid extracts were desalted by reversed-phase chromatography(32.Kyrklund T. Lipids. 1987; 22: 274-277Google Scholar). For the [14C]serine-labeled lipids, samples were applied to TLC plates on the bases of equal amounts of radioactivity, while for the loading studies, samples were chromatographed on the basis of amounts of protein (estimated after homogenization of the cells). In both instances, the solvent system was chloroform/methanol/0.22% aqueous CaCl2 (60:35:8 by volume). All glycosphingolipids were identified from their RF values. Radioactive spots were quantified using a Fuji BAS 1000 phosphorimaging system and the TINA program (version 2.07). They were visualized by autoradiography.Other MethodsProteins were assayed with bovine serum albumin as standard using the bicinchoninic acid assay(33.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Gocke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk C.D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar).Presentation of DataRadioactivity of individual sphingolipids is expressed as percentage of total radioactivity of the sphingolipid fraction. Total radioactivity is normalized to the same amount of cellular protein. All data are given as means of at least two separate experiments.RESULTSExpression and Maturation of the Three Different SAP-precursor Forms in BHK CellsIn order to follow synthesis and transport of the different SAP-precursor isoforms and their maturation in cell culture, stably transfected BHK cells were prepared. Metabolic labeling of transfected BHK cells with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation of the expressed proteins from the cell extracts with an anti-SAP-C antiserum revealed that after 1 h of pulse labeling a SAP-precursor of apparent 68 kDa was generated by all three cDNA forms (Fig. 2). Additionally processed forms of about 46 and 30 kDa were detectable. Within 2 h of chase there was significant biosynthesis of radiolabeled mature SAP-C with an apparent mass of 13 kDa. This protein was further processed to 11- to 8-kDa forms during an additional chase of 18 h. The major immunoprecipitable protein, secreted into the culture media, was the SAP-precursor with an apparent molecular mass of 73 kDa, which was already detectable after 1 h of pulse. In addition, processed proteins of molecular masses of 46 and 30 kDa were precipitable from the media, presumably identical with the tri- and disaposin forms described earlier in expression of a SAP-precursor in insects cells(27.Vara J.A. Portela A. Ortin J. Jimenez A. Nuleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4617-4624Google Scholar). During the pulse and chase periods more than 60% of the immunoprecipitable proteins were secreted into the medium of the transfected cells. Secretion of the 73-kDa forms started 30 min after a short pulse labeling of 5 min (data not shown). No cross-reacting material was precipitated from extracts of control BHK cells (Fig. 2, Co).Figure 2:Biosynthesis of the SAP-precursor isoforms in transfected BHK cells. BHK cells transfected either with the expression plasmids pBHE0, pBHE6, pBHE9, or only the vector pBHE without a cDNA insertion as a control (Co) were pulsed with [35S]methionine for 1 h and chased for the times indicated. SAP-precursors and SAP-C from the cell extracts and the media were immunoprecipitated using a rabbit anti-SAP-C antiserum and were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and fluoropgraphy. A faint band at 46 kDa, detectable only in the immunoprecipitations of the cell extracts and denoted by an asterisk, is caused by unspecific contaminations of immunoprecipitates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)This labeling experiment indicated formation of similar polypeptides in BHK cells transfected with the different SAP-precursor cDNAs as described for in human fibroblasts(4.Fujibayashi S. Wenger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15339-15343Google Scholar). The different amounts of immunoprecipitable proteins in the transfected BHK cells were due to the fact that the totality of BHK cells resistant to the antibiotics were used for pulse-chase experiments and that the selection leaves varying numbers of non-resistant cells.In order to assess correct processing of all three different recombinant SAP-precursor to the four mature SAPs (SAP-A to SAP-D) and to analyze their carbohydrate structures, the BHK transfectants were metabolically labeled for 5 h, and the cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antisera against the corresponding mature SAP-A to SAP-D (Fig. 3). All three SAP-precursors resulted in formation of mature SAP-A, SAP-B, SAP-C, and SAP-D, differing with respect to their carbohydrate types as analyzed previously(34.Yamashita K. Inui K. Totani K. Kochibe N. Furukawa M. Okada S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3030-3039Google Scholar, 35.Ito K. Takahashi N. Takahashi A. Shimada I. Arata Y. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 171-179Google Scholar). In our hands, mature SAP-A never yielded a clear band in its glycosylated form, but only a broad patch ranging from 14.5 to 29 kDa. Upon deglycosylation, however, a clear band comparible in size with deglycosylated mature SAP-B, SAP-C, and SAP-D was obtained. The carbohydrate chains of SAP-A were Endo H-resistant, presumably being of the complex type, whereas the carbohydrate moieties of SAP-C and SAP-D were predominantly of the Endo H-sensitive high mannose or hybrid type. It is noteworthy that each SAP-precursor generated a mature SAP-B with an Endo H-resistant carbohydrate chain.Figure 3:Immunoprecipitation and N-glycosylation analysis of all mature SAPs (SAP-A to SAP-D) from transfected BHK cells. The BHK cells transfected with the expression plasmids pBHE0, pBHE6, and pBHE9 were labeled with [35S]methionine for 5 h. The mature SAPs (SAP-A to SAP-D) were immunoprecipitated with the corresponding antisera as indicated and treated either with peptide-N-glycanase F (PNGase F) or Endo H as described under #x0201C;Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Endocycosis of the SAP-precursor IsoformsTo confirm that human cells process the three SAP-precursors in the same manner as the BHK transfectants, BHK cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, and the medium containing the secreted proteins was added to human fibroblasts derived from a SAP-precursor-deficient fetus(9.Schnabel D. Schröder M. Fürst W. Klein A. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Weber J. Harzer K. Paton B.C. Poulos A. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3312-3315Google Scholar). After a 24-h incubation the media and cell extracts were analyzed for immunoprecipitable SAP-B, SAP-C, and SAP-D with the corresponding antisera (Fig. 4). Some SAP-precursor was still detectable in the medium. About 50% of each of the different radiolabeled SAP-precursor forms had been internalized by the SAP-precursor deficient fibroblasts and processed to the mature SAP-A to SAP-D. Repeating the endocytosis experiment with normal human fibroblasts showed an uptake of about 30% of each prosaposin form and the same correct processing to the mature proteins (data not shown). Thus, no difference with regard to maturation was observed for any of the three SAP-precursors in human fibroblasts in comparison with BHK cells.Figure 4:Endocytosis of SAP-precursor isoforms by cultured human fibroblasts from a patient with SAP-precursor deficiency. Medium from [35S]methionine-labeled BHK cells transfected with the SAP-precursor cDNA isoforms (pBHE0, pBHE6, and pBHE9) or with the expression plasmid pBHE (Co) were added to the culture medium of unlabeled fibroblasts derived from a patient with SAP-precursor deficiency. After 24 h the fibroblasts were harvested and analyzed for internalized immunoprecipitable SAP-B, SAP-C, and SAP-D. Immunoprecipitations were carried out from the media with an anti-SAP-C antiserum and from the cell extracts with the antisera indicated. Asterisk, the faint bands visible in the control precipitation with the anti-SAP-D antiserum presumable arose from endogenous BHK cell SAP-precursor cross-reacting with this antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Purification of the SAP-precursor IsoformsThe three different isoforms of the recombinant SAP-precursors were purified from the medium of transfected BHK cells by a two-step procedure as described for the purification of SAP-precursor expressed in insect cells(29.Hiraiwa M.

The polypeptide composition of the enzyme in Rhodospirillum rubrum is unique in that the NAD(H)-binding domain (called Ths) exists as a separate polypeptide. Ths was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The binding of nucleotide substrates and analogues to Ths was examined by one-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and by measuring the quenching of fluorescence of its lone Trp residue. NADH and reduced acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide bound tightly to Ths, whereas NAD+, oxidized acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, deamino-NADH, 5′-AMP and adenosine bound less tightly. Reduced nicotinamide mononucleotide, NADPH and 2′-AMP bound only very weakly to Ths. The difference in the binding affinity between NADH and NAD+ indicates that there may be an energy requirement for the transfer of reducing equivalents into this site in the complete enzyme under physiological conditions. Earlier results had revealed a mobile loop at the surface of Ths (Diggle, C., Cotton, N. P. J., Grimley, R. L., Quirk, P. G., Thomas, C. M., and Jackson, J. B. (1995) Eur. J.

This was more clearly evident, even for tight-binding nucleotides, when experiments were carried out at higher temperatures (37°C), where the resonances of the mobile loop were substantially narrower. The binding of adenosine was sufficient to initiate loop closure; the presence of a reduced nicotinamide moiety in the dinucleotide apparently serves to tighten the binding. Two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy of the Ths-5′-AMP complex revealed nuclear Overhauser effect interactions between protons of amino acid residues in the mobile loop (including those in a Tyr residue) and the nucleotide.

https://openalex.org/W1994642993,"The C-terminal globular head of the lollipop-shaped σ1 protein of reovirus is responsible for interaction with the host cell receptor. Like the N-terminal fibrous tail, it has its own trimerization domain. Whereas N-terminal trimerization (formation of a triple α-helical coiled coil) occurs at the level of polysomes (i.e. cotranslationally) and is ATP-independent, C-terminal trimerization is a posttranslational event that requires ATP. Coprecipitation experiments using anti-Hsp70 antibodies and truncated σ1 proteins synthesized <i>in vitro</i> revealed that only regions downstream of the N-terminal α-helical coiled coil were associated with Hsp70. Hsp70 was also found to be associated with nascent σ1 chains on polysomes as well as with immature postribosomal σ1 trimers (hydra-like intermediates with assembled N termini and unassembled C termini). These latter structures were true intermediates in the σ1 biogenetic pathway since they could be chased into mature σ1 trimers with the release of Hsp70. Thus, unlike N-terminal trimerization, C-terminal trimerization is Hsp70- and ATP-dependent. The involvement of two mechanistically distinct oligomerization events for the same molecule, one cotranslational and one posttranslational, may represent a common approach to the generation of oligomeric proteins in the cytosol."

Thus, GAP-43 appears to be a common mediator of several second messenger pathways and is therefore in a position to modulate the rate, extent, or direction of axonal growth in response to external stimuli. GAP-43 expression persists in regions of the mature nervous system that retain the potential for plasticity in response to neuronal activity (27.Neve R.L. Finch E.A. Bird E.D. Benowitz L.I. Proc.

In the hippocampus, the correlation of calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of GAP-43 with long term potentiation (31.Lovinger D.M. Akers R.F. Nelson R.B.

Neuron. 1992; 8: 843-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) suggests that GAP-43 may play a role in synaptic transmission. Support for this hypothesis has been provided by experiments demonstrating that in vitro phosphorylation of GAP-43 by calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase is correlated with potassium-evoked neurotransmitter release(33.Dekker L.V. De Graan P.N.E. Versteeg D.H.G. Öestreicher A.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 52: 24-30Google Scholar). Furthermore, introduction of antibodies which interfere with GAP-43 phosphorylation into permeabilized synaptosomes inhibits Ca2+-induced neurotransmitter release(34.Dekker L.V. De Graan P.N.E.

Finally, antisense RNA-mediated inhibition of GAP-43 in PC12 cells leads to a decreased release of dopamine in response to elevated potassium(39.Ivins K.J. Neve K.A. Feller D.J. Fidel S.A. Neve R.L. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These investigations suggest that GAP-43 is necessary for exocytosis but additional experiments are required to further define the role of GAP-43 in this process. The AtT-20/D16-16 (D16) cell line is a subclone (40.Sabol S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 203: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) of the original AtT-20 mouse pituitary tumor cell line(41.Buonassisi V. Sato G. Cohen A.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Both of these cell lines secrete pro-opiomelanocortin-derived peptide hormones(42.Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5732-5744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The D16 cells are more amenable to manipulation in culture and respond to a variety of secretagogues, including corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), noradrenaline, potassium, phorbol esters, and calcium ionophores (reviewed in (44.Axelrod J. Reisine T.D. Science. 1984; 224: 452-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar)) and have therefore been used widely to study secretion(45.Kelly R.B. Science. 1985; 230: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). We have discovered that D16 cells express GAP-43 at high levels and display a robust secretory response to potassium-mediated membrane depolarization. In contrast, GAP-43 is undetectable in the original AtT-20 cells, and potassium evokes only a modest amount of hormone release. This correlation led us to investigate further the role of GAP-43 in neuropeptide secretion in the AtT-20 cell lines. The expression vector for rat GAP-43 was produced by ligating a 1.1-kilobase pair restriction fragment containing the entire rat GAP-43 coding sequence (5.Karns L.R. Ng S.-C. Freeman J.A. Fishman M.C. Science. 1987; 236: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) into the pRc/RSV vector (Invitrogen) with the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter (46.Gorman C. Padmanabhan R. Howard B.H. Science. 1983; 221: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) driving expression of the cDNA. To generate the probe for the RNase protection assay a 300-base pair DraI/SacI restriction fragment derived from the rat GAP-43 expression vector (which includes a portion of 3′-untranslated region of the rat GAP-43 cDNA and some adjacent vector sequences) was ligated into pGEM-3Zf (Promega). This riboprobe will protect two fragments: the larger (approximately 270 nt) results from hybridization with the mRNA transcribed from the transfected rat GAP-43 cDNA, and the smaller fragment (approximately 240 nt) results from hybridization with the endogenous GAP-43 transcript. All cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Monolayer cultures of D16 cells and transfected cell lines were maintained in 95% Opti-MEM I, 5% fetal bovine serum. The original AtT-20 cells were cultured in 85% Opti-MEM I, 10% equine serum, 5% fetal bovine serum; medium for routine culture of the transfected cells contained 200 μg/ml G418. All cell lines were incubated in humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37°C. The AtT-20/D16 cells were generously provided by Dr. Lee Limbird, Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, and the original AtT-20 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL89). The original AtT-20 cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 20 × 106 cells were transfected with 15 μg of the GAP-43 expression plasmid and 60 μl of LipofectAMINE. After 6 h of incubation at 37°C, the medium was removed and replaced by normal culture medium. After 72 h cells were split into selective medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. Clones were then isolated by limiting dilution and expanded in culture. Cells were spun and resuspended at 107 cell/ml in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (KRH) buffer (125 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 2.6 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 25 mM Hepes, 5.6 mM glucose, pH 7.4). Fura-2/acetoxymethylester (Fura-2/AM, Molecular Probes) was added at a final concentration of 1 μM, and loading was done for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Unincorporated dye was removed by washing the cells once with KRH. Cells were resuspended at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in KRH prewarmed at 37°C and transferred in fluorimeter cuvette and incubated at 37°C for 30 min, to allow complete de-esterification. Fura-2 fluorescence was measured using a LS50 luminescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer), and Ca2+ concentrations were calculated as described by Grynkiewicz et al.(47.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using the Intracellular Biochemistry software package (Perkin-Elmer). Total cellular RNA was extracted using the acid-guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method(48.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62312) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled complementary RNA probes were generated in vitro with [α-32P]UTP (DuPont NEN) as label. Five μg of total RNA from each sample were ethanol-precipitated and re-dissolved in 40 mM PIPES, pH 6.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.4 M NaCl, 80% formamide with 105 cpm of labeled RNA probe. The RNAs were denatured by heating to 85°C for 5 min, then hybridized at 48°C overnight. RNase protection analysis was performed by standard methods (49.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using digestion with RNase T1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 30°C. The resulting RNA fragments were resolved by electrophoresis in a 6% acrylamide, 8 M urea sequencing gel, which was dried and exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat AR, Eastman Kodak Co.), with an intensifying screen at −70°C. Total cellular proteins were extracted with radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) containing 2 μg/ml aprotinin and quantified by the method of Bradford (50.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (205570) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Subcellular fractionation was performed by lysing cells in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA and separating the particulate and soluble fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on SDS-10% polyacrylamide minigels (Hoefer Scientific Instruments) and transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Protein blots were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with either an anti-rat GAP-43 polyclonal antibody (30.de La Monte S.M. Federoff H.J. Ng S.C. Grabczyk E.

Brain Res. 1989; 46: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) or an anti-GAP-43 monoclonal antibody (clone GAP-7B10, Sigma,) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (DuPont NEN) and exposure to x-ray film. Cells were plated in six-well cluster dishes at an initial density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well and were used for experiments 6 days later. For incubations with CRF, the medium was replaced by prewarmed Opti-MEM I containing bovine serum albumin (2.5 mg/ml) and protease inhibitors (0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After 30 min the medium was removed and replaced by fresh medium without (basal) or with 100 nM CRF (Sigma), and the cells were incubated an additional 30 min at 37°C. For K+ stimulation, the cells were equilibrated for 15 min in KRH. The medium was then removed and the cells were incubated for 5 min either in KRH buffer (basal) or in KRH buffer containing 56 mM KCl (in which the NaCl concentration was decreased to maintain iso-osmolarity). After the incubation with either CRF or elevated potassium the medium was collected, centrifuged 3 min at 1,700 × g to remove dislodged cells and debris, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride added to a final concentration of 2 mM. The cells were collected in phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and protein was extracted from the cell pellets with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing protease inhibitors. Secreted and cellular hormones were measured by radioimmunoassay. Net secretion (CRF or K+-stimulated minus basal) was expressed as the percent of total cellular stores of β-endorphin released during the incubation period. β-Endorphin immunoassays were performed as described previously(51.Hatfield J.M. Allen R.G. Stack J. Ronnekleiv O. Dev. Biol. 1988; 126: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), using an antiserum which is specific for β-endorphin residues 15-26. Synthetic acetyl-β-endorphin 1-27 was used as tracer and standard, and a 12-point standard curve was assayed with each group of samples. The unpaired “t” test was used to determine the statistical significance of the results. Levels of GAP-43 in the original AtT-20 and D16 cell lines were determined by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, GAP-43 is undetectable in the original AtT-20 cells, but is expressed at high levels in the D16 cells. As previous investigations had suggested that GAP-43 might be involved in exocytosis(33.Dekker L.V. De Graan P.N.E. Versteeg D.H.G. Öestreicher A.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 52: 24-30Google Scholar, 34.Dekker L.V. De Graan P.N.E. Öestreicher A.B. Versteeg D.H.G. Gispen W.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 39.Ivins K.J. Neve K.A. Feller D.J. Fidel S.A. Neve R.L. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we analyzed evoked hormone secretion in these two cell lines. Initial experiments with cultures of D16 cells demonstrated that 56 mM K+-evoked and 100 nM CRF-evoked β-endorphin secretion were linear for at least 5 and 30 min, respectively (data not shown). Net CRF-stimulated secretion (stimulated minus basal) from the D16 cells averaged 6.9% of the total cellular stores in 30 min and produced an identical secretory response in the original AtT-20 (Fig. 2A). All of the essential components of the secretory machinery are thus present and functional in both cell lines. In contrast to the results with CRF, potassium depolarization resulted in a marked stimulation of β-endorphin secretion from the D16 cells (17.7% of total cellular stores in 5 min), but produced a dramatically lower amount of secretion from the original AtT-20 (net 1.6% of total cellular stores; Fig. 2B). We have verified by spectrofluorimetric analysis with the dye Fura2-AM that depolarization-mediated calcium influx is similar in these two cell lines (Fig. 3). These results prompted us to ask whether expression of GAP-43 in the original AtT-20 cells would restore potassium-evoked secretion. The original AtT-20 cells were transfected with a plasmid in which expression of the rat GAP-43 cDNA was driven by the RSV promoter and permanently transfected cells were selected with G418. RNase protection analysis with a radiolabeled antisense RNA GAP-43 probe demonstrates that five cell lines, designated AtT-20:rGAP-43 #1, AtT-20:rGAP-43 G8D, AtT-20:rGAP-43 G4G, AtT-20:rGAP-43 K3F, and AtT-20:rGAP-43 H5E, transcribe GAP-43 RNA from both the transfected GAP-43 cDNA and the endogenous gene (Fig. 4A, lanes 8-12). Four other G418-resistant cell lines that were obtained by transfecting the backbone plasmid pRc/RSV into AtT-20 cells and were designated as AtT-20:pRc/RSV BB1, AtT-20:pRc/RSV CC1, AtT-20:pRc/RSV DD1, and AtT-20:pRc/RSV DD2 (lanes 4-7) express only the endogenous GAP-43 mRNA, which is also readily detectable in the parental AtT-20 (lane 3) and D16 cell lines (lane 2). The expression of GAP-43 protein in these cell lines was then analyzed by immunoblot (Fig. 4B). As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the D16 cells (lane 1) produce high amounts of GAP-43, but the protein is undetectable in the original AtT-20 (lane 2). The AtT-20:rGAP-43 #1, G8D, G4G, K3F, and H5E cell lines, which transcribe GAP-43 RNA from the transfected cDNA, also produce significant amount of GAP-43 protein (lanes 7-11). In contrast, this polypeptide is undetectable in the control cell lines AtT-20:pRc/RSV BB1, CC1, DD1, and DD2, which express only the endogenous GAP-43 mRNA (lanes 3-6). In neurons, GAP-43 is mostly associated with the plasma membrane(7.Meiri K.F. Pfenninger K.H. Willard M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Subcellular fractionation indicated that GAP-43 localizes to the particulate fraction in the transfected AtT-20 and the D16 cell lines as well (data not shown). The transfected AtT-20 cell lines were stimulated for 5 min with 56 mM KCl and secretion of β-endorphin was measured as described. These studies revealed that β-endorphin secretion in the GAP-43-expressing AtT-20:rGAP-43 cell lines was markedly stimulated (on the average 7.5% of total cellular stores in 5 min). In contrast, secretion in the control AtT-20:pRc/RSV cell lines (2.4% of total cellular stores in 5 min) was not significantly different from that in the parental AtT-20 cell line (Table 1). Potassium-evoked Ca2+ influx in the transfected cell lines (measured by spectrofluorimetric analysis using the dye Fura-2/AM) was similar to that in the parental AtT-20 and D16 cells (Fig. 5). CRF-evoked hormone secretion in the transfected cells expressing GAP-43 was not significantly increased (data not shown). As GAP-43 has been shown to induce process outgrowth when transfected into non-neuronal cells(54.Zuber M. Goodman D. Karns L.R. Fishman M.C. Science. 1989; 244: 1193-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 58.Yankner B.A. Benowitz L.I. Villa-Komakoff L. Neve R.L. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 62.Strittmatter S.M. Valenzuela D. Fishman M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 195-204PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated if transfection of GAP-43 would also cause morphological changes in AtT-20 cells. The D16 cells grow as a monolayer, flatten, and extend processes when plated at low density (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the original AtT-20 cells normally grow in suspension but will attach to laminin-coated culture substrates while retaining a rounded morphology (Fig. 6B). The transfected cell lines also grow in suspension under routine culture conditions. However, when seeded on laminin-coated plates, about 30% of the transfected cells expressing GAP-43 flattened and extended processes (Fig. 6C). These morphological changes were not observed for the control AtT-20:pRc/RSV CC1 cell line cultured in the same conditions (Fig. 6D). We report here that transfection of GAP-43 into mouse anterior pituitary AtT-20 cells dramatically augments depolarization-mediated hormone secretion without a change in calcium influx. Additionally, induced expression of GAP-43 results in morphological alterations that include process outgrowth from the cells. Expression of GAP-43 is not detectable in either the anterior lobe cells of the pituitary (63.Paden C.M. Moffett C.W. Benowitz L.I. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or in the original AtT-20 cell line, which was derived from a mouse anterior pituitary tumor. In marked contrast, GAP-43 expression is robust in the AtT-20/D16 cell line that was subcloned from the original AtT-20. Our initial studies indicated that the secretory response to elevated extracellular potassium was well correlated with the expression of GAP-43 in the two cell lines. The possibility that this differential response to membrane depolarization might be due to some difference between these cells other than GAP-43 expression is ruled out by the demonstration that transfection of GAP-43 into the original AtT-20 cells restores potassium-evoked secretion. GAP-43 augments potassium depolarization-mediated hormone release without a significant effect on CRF-induced secretion. This differential effect may be due to the fact that these two secretagogues appear to act via different biochemical mechanisms, which have been characterized extensively in the AtT-20/D16 cells. CRF, the normal secretagogue for anterior pituitary corticotrophs, binds to cell surface receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase through Gs. The ensuing increase in cellular cyclic AMP levels activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase which phosphorylates calcium channels(64.Luini A. Lewis D. Guild S. Corda S. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8034-8038Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This effect occurs within minutes after the addition of CRF to the cells. Potassium depolarization produces a much larger and more rapid calcium mobilization through voltage-gated channels(65.Guild S. Reisine T.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 241: 125-130PubMed Google Scholar), without a change in intracellular cAMP. GAP-43 may serve to facilitate transmission of the biochemical signal that is initiated by the rapid transient depolarization-induced influx of calcium. GAP-43 has been characterized previously as a calmodulin-binding protein with the unusual property of binding calmodulin under low calcium conditions and releasing it in response to elevations in calcium(16.Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Alexander K.A. Wakim B.T. Doyle G.S. Walsh K.A. Storm D.R. J. Biol.

This property has led to the hypothesis that GAP-43 may serve to sequester calmodulin at the inner face of the plasma membrane to permit the rapid activation of calmodulin-dependent processes(66.Liu Y. Storm D.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), including CaM kinase II, which has been implicated in neurotransmitter release(67.Llinás R. McGuinness T.L. Leonard C.S. Sugimori M. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3035-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 68.Nichols R.A. Sihra T.S. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Nature. 1990; 343: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The fact that the AtT-20 cells that do not express GAP-43 are nevertheless capable of calcium-dependent secretion of hormone in response to CRF suggests that the action of GAP-43 in the secretory process is likely to be indirect. Our results are consistent with those of Gispen and colleagues, who have demonstrated that introduction of GAP-43 antibodies into permeabilized synaptosomes inhibits calcium-dependent GAP-43 phosphorylation and neurotransmitter release(34.Dekker L.V. De Graan P.N.E. Öestreicher A.B. Versteeg D.H.G. Gispen W.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 35.Dekker L.V. De Graan P.N.E. Pijnappel P. Öestreicher A.B.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ivins et al. (39.Ivins K.J. Neve K.A. Feller D.J. Fidel S.A. Neve R.L. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) showed that antisense RNA-mediated inhibition of GAP-43 expression in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells significantly diminishes depolarization-mediated catecholamine secretion. Possible mechanisms for the action of GAP-43 in secretion have been addressed in additional studies with synaptosomes using antibodies directed specifically against the amino terminus of GAP-43, which have provided further evidence for a role of calmodulin in this process(38.Hens J.J.H. De Wit M. Boosma F. Mercken M. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. De Graan P.N.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, introduction of GAP-43 peptides into permeabilized chromaffin cells has been shown to modulate Ca2+-regulated exocytosis via interactions with GTP-binding proteins(69.Vitale N. Deloulme J.-C. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30293-30298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these previous studies, most of which have relied upon the inhibition of GAP-43 function, our investigations have demonstrated a robust and readily quantifiable positive effect that results from the stable expression of GAP-43 in a well characterized cell line. This suggests that AtT-20 cells will be a useful model system for future studies of the precise molecular mechanisms of GAP-43 action and may help to resolve some of the unresolved issues that remain from previous investigations(35.Dekker L.V. De Graan P.N.E. Pijnappel P. Öestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Forced expression of GAP-43 also caused the original AtT-20 cells to flatten and extend processes on laminin-coated culture substrata. These processes are clearly present for several days in culture and are thus significantly more stable than the transient processes induced by GAP-43 in COS and CHO cells(54.Zuber M. Goodman D. Karns L.R. Fishman M.C. Science. 1989; 244: 1193-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 61.Widmer F. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 62.Strittmatter S.M. Valenzuela D. Fishman M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 195-204PubMed Google Scholar). The stability of this response in our studies suggests again that AtT-20 cells will be a useful model system for future investigations of the mechanism of GAP-43 action. The morphological alterations noted here may relate to the postulated role of GAP-43 in axonal growth and regeneration, in which context this polypeptide was first identified(70.Skene J.H.P. Willard M.B. J. Neurosci. 1981; 1: 419-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 71.Skene J.H.P. Willard M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 86-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). A multitude of subsequent investigations has sought convincing evidence for a role of GAP-43 in process extension (reviewed in Refs. 10, 52, and 72); the results of these studies have been somewhat equivocal. For example, although the expression of GAP-43 is highly correlated with axonal growth in a variety of experimental systems(7.Meiri K.F. Pfenninger K.H. Willard M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schreyer D.J. Skene J.H.P. Banker G. Nature. 1988; 336: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a line of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells that lacks GAP-43 can elongate long branching processes in response to nerve growth factor(82.Baetge E.E. Hammang J.P. Neuron. 1991; 6: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine-mediated introduction of GAP-43 antibodies into NB2a/d1 neuroblastoma cells in culture does, however, prevent the initial phase of neurite outgrowth in response to cyclic AMP(83.Shea T.B. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. Beermann M.L. Benowitz L.I. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1685-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This variability in the requirement for GAP-43 may result from the fact that the precise function of this protein is dependent upon the cell type in which it is expressed. Alternatively, the role of GAP-43 in axonal growth may be indirect, as suggested by recent studies on the effects of disruption of the GAP-43 gene in the mouse embryo(84.Strittmatter S.M. Fankhauser C. Huang P.L. Mashimo H. Fishman M.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 445-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The effects of GAP-43 on cellular morphology noted in the current study represent a positive effect of the induced expression of the protein and again indicate the utility of AtT-20 cells for studies of the mechanism of action of this protein, which we are now pursuing."

One such kinase, Lck, has been demonstrated genetically to be essential for T cell receptor (TcR) signaling, and the SH2 and SH3 (src homology 2 and 3) domains of Lck have been shown to be indispensable for T cell activation. We have sought substrates with which the SH2,3 domain would interact following T cell activation, using fusion proteins containing the Lck SH2 and SH3 domains linked to glutathione S-transferase. We demonstrate that the SH2,3 region interacts specifically and directly with numerous tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules following TcR cross-linking, including constitutively with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-regulated kinase and inducibly with the ζ chain of the TcR.

Here we investigate whether TrkC, a neuronal high affinity receptor for neurotrophin-3, is expressed in the insulin-secreting cell line INS-1. We demonstrate the expression in INS-1 cells of mRNAs coding for TrkC identical in size to those found in the brain. As in neuronal cells, different alternatively spliced forms of TrkC mRNA, differing by the insertion of an alternative exon in their kinase domain, were expressed in INS-1 cells. TrkC protein is also expressed in INS-1 cells and is functional. Indeed, when INS-1 cells were treated with neurotrophin-3, TrkC became phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, and the expression of early response genes was induced. This activation of the receptor was paralleled by a rapid and transient increase in cytosolic free calcium due to an influx of extracellular calcium. Functional receptors for NT-3 are thus expressed in INS-1 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2026104886,"The catalytic (C) subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) is regarded as a framework for the protein kinase family. Its sequence is composed of a conserved core (residues 40 300) between two segments at the amino and carboxyl termini of the protein. Since the various protein kinases differ in their specificity, it seems reasonable to assume that these nonhomologous segments may be involved in endowing each kinase with its individual specificity. Here we present data to show that the cluster of acidic amino acids (328DDYEEEE334) at the carboxyl-terminal tail of the C subunit, specifically Tyr330, contributes to its substrate recognition. This is based on three complementary lines of evidence: (i) on a conformation-sensitive cleavage of the C subunit by a kinase-splitting membranal proteinase that specifically recognizes this cluster, to demonstrate the occurrence in solution of (cleavable) and (noncleavable) conformations of the C subunit; (ii) on analysis of the three-dimensional structures of the open and closed conformations of the C subunit, showing an approximately 7-A movement of the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr330 to reach (in the closed conformation) an approximately 3-A distance from the nitrogen atoms of the Arg residue at position p-3 of the PKA consensus sequence; and (iii) on single-site mutations of the C subunit (e.g. Y330A) that show a significant contribution of Tyr330 to the Km of PKA for its substrates/inhibitors and to its catalytic efficacy (Vmax/Km)."

The recombinant proteins were expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The two well defined resonances at 6.82 and 7.12ppm, observed in the one-dimensional proton NMR spectrum of wild-type protein, and previously attributed to the Tyr residue, were absent in both mutants. In the Tyr235→ Phe mutant Ths, they were replaced by two new resonances at 7.26 and 7.33 ppm, characteristic of a Phe residue. In both mutants, narrow resonances attributable to Met residues (and in the Tyr235→ Phe mutant, resonances attributable to Ala residues) were shifted relative to the wild type, but other features in the NMR spectra were unaffected. The conformational dynamics of the mobile loop closure in response to nucleotide binding by the protein were altered in the two mutants. The fluorescence emission from Trp72 was unaffected by both Tyr substitutions, and the fluorescence was still quenched by NADH. The mutant Ths proteins bound to chromatophore membranes depleted of their native Ths with undiminished affinity. In these reconstituted systems, the Km values for thio-NADP+ and NADH, during light-driven transhydrogenation, were similar to those of wild-type, but the kcat values were decreased about 2-fold. In reverse transhydrogenation, the Kmvalues for NADPH were slightly decreased in the mutants relative to wild-type, but those for acetyl pyridine adenine dinucleotide were increased about 10- and 13-fold, respectively, and the kcat values were decreased about 2- and 5-fold, respectively, in the Tyr235→ Phe and Tyr235→ Asn mutants. It is concluded that Tyr235 may contribute to the process of nucleotide binding and that substitution of this residue prevents proper functioning of the mobile loop in catalysis.

In animal mitochondria and bacteria, transhydrogenase is driven in the direction of NADP+ reduction by the protonmotive force generated through the action of respiratory (or photosynthetic) electron transport chains. NADP++NADH+Hout+↔NADPH+NAD++Hin+Reaction 1 Uniquely in Rhodospirillum rubrum, the NAD(H)-binding domain I of transhydrogenase exists as a separate polypeptide(1.Cunningham I.J. Williams R. Palmer T. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 332-338Google Scholar, 2.Williams R. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1595-1604Google Scholar, 3.Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 435-445Google Scholar). This polypeptide can be expressed in large quantities in Escherichia coli and purified as a water-soluble protein (4.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Google Scholar). Like the native protein (called Ths), 1The abbreviations used are: Thsthe NAD(H)-binding peripheral membrane polypeptide (domain I) of transhydrogenase from R. rubrumAcPdAD+acetyl pyridine adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form)Mops4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. the recombinant form is dimeric and can restore transhydrogenation activity to everted membranes (chromatophores) of R. rubrum, which have been washed to remove native Ths. Ths binds NADH with a Kd of about 20 μM(4.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Google Scholar). the NAD(H)-binding peripheral membrane polypeptide (domain I) of transhydrogenase from R. rubrum acetyl pyridine adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. Domain I of transhydrogenase has a mobile loop straddling protease-sensitive sites (Lys227-Thr228 and Lys237-Glu238 in R. rubrum Ths). It is detectable by NMR, and its conformation is altered when the protein binds nucleotides(5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar). A Gly-Tyr-Ala motif (residues 234-236 in the R. rubrum protein) in this region is conserved in all known transhydrogenase sequences. It was proposed that 3,5 and 2,6 ring protons of Tyr in the motif give rise to resonances at 6.82 and 7.12 ppm, respectively, in the NMR spectrum of R. rubrum Ths, and equivalent resonances in the spectrum of E. coli domain I protein(5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar). Here we test this hypothesis by examining mutants of R. rubrum Ths in which Tyr235 has been substituted by Asn or Phe. Because the residue is conserved, and approaches nucleotide to within 0.5 nm in domain I-AMP complex(13.Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Quirk P.G. Grimley R.L. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10103-10108Google Scholar), Tyr235 might have a role in catalysis. We examine the effect of Tyr235→ Asn and Tyr235→ Phe substitutions in Ths on the binding of NADH, as judged by quenching of fluorescence of the lone Trp residue of the protein, on conformational dynamics of the loop during the binding of NAD(H) and analogues as determined by NMR, and on catalytic activity and Michaelis constants of mutant protein in forward (energy-linked) and reverse transhydrogenation after reconstitution with depleted R. rubrum membranes bearing domain II/III proteins of the enzyme. The results are compared with those in which the effect on reverse transhydrogenation activity of mutating the equivalent residue in E. coli enzyme was measured in membrane fractions(6.Olausson T. Hultman T. Holmberg E. Rydstrom J. Ahmad S. Glavas N.A. Bragg P.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13237-13244Google Scholar). Routine operations, including agarose-gel electrophoresis, preparation of plasmid DNA, growth and handling of E. coli strains, and preparation of competent cells and transformation, were carried out as described(7.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were used according to manufacturers' instructions. Mutagenesis was carried out by the gapped duplex method(8.Stanssens P. Opsomer C. McKeown Y. Kramer W. Zabeau M. Fritz H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4441-4454Google Scholar). The 700-base pair EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pCD1 (4.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Google Scholar) was cloned into the EcoRI-HindIII site of pMa (8.Stanssens P. Opsomer C. McKeown Y. Kramer W. Zabeau M. Fritz H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4441-4454Google Scholar). Following mutagenesis, the EcoRIHindIII fragment was cloned back into pCD1 and transformed into E. coli C600. The fragment was then sequenced to check for errors; none were found. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Qiagen-tip 20 kit. DNA within the EcoRI-HindIII sites was sequenced with an Applied Biosystems Inc. model 373A sequencer, using the manufacturer's kit employing Taq polymerase and dye terminators, according to their instructions. E. coli cells carrying plasmids bearing either wild-type or mutant Ths genes were induced as described(4.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant Ths were purified by column chromatography(1.Cunningham I.J. Williams R. Palmer T. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 332-338Google Scholar). Everted membrane vesicles (chromatophores) from phototrophically-grown cells of R. rubrum were prepared and depleted of their native Ths as described(1.Cunningham I.J. Williams R. Palmer T. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 332-338Google Scholar, 10.Fisher R.R. Guillory R.J. FEBS Lett. 1969; 3: 27-30Google Scholar). Chromatophores of strains that overexpress transhydrogenase (11.Bizouarn T. Sazanov L.A. Aubourg S. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 4-12Google Scholar) were depleted of Ths by washing 3-4 times in 2 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Protein was estimated by the microtannin assay(12.Mejbaum-Katzenellenbogen S. Drobryszycka W.J. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1959; 4: 515-522Google Scholar), without using the correction procedure determined(4.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Google Scholar), see(13.Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Quirk P.G. Grimley R.L. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10103-10108Google Scholar). Bacteriochlorophyll was measured using the in vivo extinction coefficient(14.Clayton R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 75: 312-323Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described (15.Lever T.M. Palmer T. Cunningham I.J. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 247-255Google Scholar). Reverse transhydrogenation activity of reconstituted membranes was measured at 375-450 nm as reduction of AcPdAD+ by NADPH. Forward transhydrogenation activity was measured at 395-450 nm as reduction of thio-NADP+ by NADH by membranes irradiated with photosynthetically-active light(16.Cotton N.P.J. Lever T.M. Nore B.F. Jones M.R. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 593-603Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients are given (17.Palmer T. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1099: 157-162Google Scholar). Reconstitution of depleted membranes and Ths was carried out by simple mixing followed by a few seconds of incubation at 30°C(18.Cunningham I.J. Baker J.A. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 345-352Google Scholar). Fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy of purified Ths were carried out as described(4.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Google Scholar, 5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar). Mutant and wild-type R. rubrum Ths, the domain I polypeptide of transhydrogenase, were expressed in E. coli, and purified. During chromatography on QA-Trisacryl, Reactive-Green-19 agarose, and AcA-44(1.Cunningham I.J. Williams R. Palmer T. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 332-338Google Scholar, 4.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Google Scholar), both mutant proteins displayed similar elution profiles to wild-type Ths (not shown). Notably, the proteins had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 74 kDa by non-denaturing gel filtration, indicating that, like the wild type, they are dimeric. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, both ran as single polypeptides with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa, indistinguishable from wild-type Ths (data not shown; compare (1.Cunningham I.J. Williams R. Palmer T. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 332-338Google Scholar) and (4.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Google Scholar)). NMR spectra of purified wild-type and mutant Ths are shown in Fig. 1. The general characteristics of the spectra, including broad humps of aromatic and methyl protons from 9-6 ppm and 2.3-0.3 ppm, respectively, were similar, indicating that the overall fold of the mutant proteins was unchanged by the amino acid substitutions. Like wild-type Ths, those of the mutants' spectra displayed a number of narrower resonances superimposed upon the broad methyl and aromatic proton absorptions. Some or all of these resonances probably derive from amino acids in a mobile loop that straddles protease cleavage sites at the protein surface(5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar, 13.Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Quirk P.G. Grimley R.L. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10103-10108Google Scholar). On the basis of the effect on the NMR spectrum of cleavage of Ths by trypsin at Lys227-Thr228 and Lys237-Glu238, the particularly clear resonances at 6.82 and 7.12 ppm in wild-type Ths were assigned to 3,5 and 2,6 ring protons of Tyr235(5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar). These resonances were absent in both the Tyr235→ Asn and Tyr235→ Phe mutants (Fig. 1). Evidently, resonances from other Tyr residues (at positions 120, 146, and 154) are very broad, as expected for residues in a molecule having the correlation time of an 80-kDa protein like the Ths dimer. The appearance of resonances in the Tyr235→ Asn mutant, between 2.6 and 2.8 ppm, corresponding to the βCH2 of the Asn residue introduced into the loop, was obscured by those from dithiothreitol (and its breakdown products) in the sample. However, in the Tyr235→ Phe mutant, new narrow resonances were observed at 7.26 and 7.33 ppm, characteristic of ring protons of Phe. These resonances were considerably sharper than those in wild-type protein at 7.33 ppm, which were also attributed to Phe (possibly Phe218). Unexpectedly, the two Tyr235 substitutions both had effects on resonances previously assigned to the CH3 groups of Met residues (Fig. 1). The NMR spectra of wild-type Ths at 20°C reveal sharp resonances attributable to Met residues at 1.97 and 2.04 ppm with shoulders at 2.06 and 2.08 ppm(5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar, 13.Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Quirk P.G. Grimley R.L. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10103-10108Google Scholar); they are designated MetA, MetB, MetC, and MetD, respectively (Table 1). In the Tyr235→ Asn mutant, MetB was unaffected, but MetA was shifted downfield by 0.04 ppm, and MetC was shifted 0.02 ppm downfield to overlap with MetD at 2.08 ppm. In the Tyr235→ Phe mutant, MetB again was unaffected, MetA was again shifted downfield (but only by 0.02 ppm), and a slight downfield shift of MetC resulted in a peak at 2.065 ppm with a shoulder at 2.08 ppm (MetD, Table 1). In the Tyr235→ Phe mutant, but not the Tyr235→ Asn mutant, the region of the Ala resonances was resolved into two distinct components (each possibly comprising one or more Ala βCH3 doublets). Note that trypsin treatment of wild-type protein also resulted in separation of two Ala components (5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar); the mobile loop region includes several Ala residues.Tabled 1 Resonances other than those assigned to Tyr and Met (and, in the Tyr235→ Phe mutant, Ala) were indistinguishable in mutant and wild-type proteins. Thus, the CH3 of Thr at 1.25 ppm and ring protons of Phe at 7.37 ppm (although these were obscured in the Tyr235→ Phe mutant), the tentative Gly CH2 at 3.96 ppm and Glu γCH2 at 2.31 ppm, the resonances from unassigned amino acid residues at 7.6-7.9 ppm, fine structure superimposed on the broad methyl absorption at 0.8-1.0 ppm, and the ring-shifted methyl protons at approximately 0.17, 0.30, and 0.63 ppm were all essentially unchanged in both mutants. The conformational dynamics, as revealed by NMR, of amino acid residues in the mobile loop of wild-type-Ths during binding of NAD(H) and analogues have been discussed(5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar, 13.Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Quirk P.G. Grimley R.L. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10103-10108Google Scholar). NMR spectra recorded in titrations of the Tyr235→ Asn and Tyr235→ Phe mutants with NADH and NAD+ are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively. They reveal some differences from data for wild-type Ths. In wild-type Ths a two-step binding reaction is revealed in NMR spectra recorded during nucleotide titrations(5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar, 13.Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Quirk P.G. Grimley R.L. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10103-10108Google Scholar). It is characterized by specific broadening of MetA at low concentrations of nucleotide, followed, at higher concentrations, by broadening of other resonances assigned to the mobile loop. In titrations with NADH the two-step reaction is barely perceptible at 20°C, although easily resolved at 37°C(13.Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Quirk P.G. Grimley R.L. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10103-10108Google Scholar). In the Tyr235→ Phe mutant Ths (Fig. 3), a similar sequence of events was observed to that in wild-type. Two differences were: (a) the new Phe resonances at 7.26 and 7.33 ppm broadened during the titration in the same way that the Tyr resonances broadened in wild-type protein, and (b) of the two Ala resonances, split in the mutant, the more upfield was more sensitive to broadening by NADH. Probably because in the Tyr235→ Asn mutant the MetA resonance is displaced downfield in the absence of nucleotides (see Table 1), the two-step binding reaction was clearly observed in NADH titrations even at 20°C (Fig. 2). Thus, 30 μM NADH led to more extensive broadening of MetA than, for example, the Ala or the Thr resonances. Higher concentrations (200 μM) did lead to broadening of the latter. The dependence of resonance broadening on NADH concentration in both mutants was similar to that with wild-type protein. NMR spectra recorded in titrations of mutant Ths with the analogue, AcPdADH, were qualitatively similar to those from NADH titrations (not shown). Also reflecting ligand-protein interaction, linewidths of the NADH (and AcPdADH) resonances remained broad during titration against both of the mutant proteins until added nucleotide reached concentrations approaching 10-3M (i.e. in considerable excess of protein concentration). Similar behavior was observed with wild-type protein and was suggested to result from decreased mobility of NADH in its protein-bound state and to an intermediate/fast exchange(5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar). In titrations of the mutant proteins with NAD+, the two-step reaction observed with wild-type protein (5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar) was again evident. Thus, moderately low concentrations of oxidized nucleotide had a specific effect on the MetA resonance, before other mobile loop resonances were broadened (Figure 2:, Figure 3:). In the Tyr235→ Asn protein, in which the MetA resonance was displaced downfield (see above), addition of NAD+ led, not only to broadening, but also to a shift back upfield that was more extensive than that in wild-type Ths (Fig. 2; compare (5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar)). Whereas the concentration dependence of resonance broadening was similar in NADH titrations for wild-type Ths and for mutant proteins, this was not the case with NAD+, where higher concentrations were required for both mutants to give the response observed in the wild type. In marked contrast to the considerable broadening of NADH resonances in the presence of either wild-type (5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar, 13.Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Quirk P.G. Grimley R.L. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10103-10108Google Scholar) or mutant Ths (above), NAD+ resonances became evident in the wild-type titration spectra even at quite low concentrations, consistent with a higher Kd value for oxidized nucleotide and faster exchange. In titrations with Tyr235→ Asn and Tyr235→ Phe mutants (Fig. 2D and 3D), NAD+ proton resonances were detectable at even lower concentrations of nucleotide, providing another indication of its weaker binding. As with wild-type Ths, NMR spectra of the mutants titrated with AcPdAD+ and with 5‘-AMP were similar to those with NAD+ (not shown). Notably, they revealed a two-step binding process; the MetA resonance was affected at lower concentrations of nucleotide than the other loop resonances. As with NAD+, higher concentrations of both AcPdAD+ and 5‘-AMP were required with both mutant proteins to produce an equivalent broadening of the narrow resonances, and again, nucleotide resonances were resolved at lower concentrations in the mutant than in wild-type titrations. Fluorescence from the sole Trp residue at position 72 in wild-type Ths has an extremely small Stokes shift, and a monoexponential decay with a long lifetime, indicating that it lies in a rigid, non-polar environment(4.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Google Scholar). The Tyr235→ Asn and the Tyr235→ Phe mutants of Ths have similar emission spectra, establishing that the environment of the Trp in the protein is unchanged by amino acid substitutions (data not shown). As in wild-type protein, fluorescence from Trp72 in the Tyr235→ Asn and Tyr235→ Phe mutants was quenched upon addition of NADH. The dependences of fluorescence quenching on nucleotide concentration were broadly similar to that in wild-type (Fig. 4). Note, however, that because the Kd is quite high, this analysis does not sensitively detect decreases in binding affinity. In stopped flow experiments (data not shown), it was observed that the time course of Trp72 fluorescence quenching by NADH was similar in the Tyr235→ Asn mutant to that for wild-type Ths(4.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Google Scholar). Judging by the quenching of Trp fluorescence, wild-type Ths bound AcPdADH with a lower affinity than NADH(13.Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Quirk P.G. Grimley R.L. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10103-10108Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that the Tyr235→ Asn and Tyr235→ Phe Ths mutants also bound AcPdADH with a low affinity. Because of limitations imposed by inner filtering by the nucleotide (see above), it was difficult to estimate precise Kd values. In common with wild-type Ths, addition of either NAD+ or NADPH led to no fluorescence quenching up to about 60 μM. Isolated Ths does not catalyze transhydrogenation between NADPH and AcPdAD+(1.Cunningham I.J. Williams R. Palmer T. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 332-338Google Scholar, 4.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Google Scholar) or between NADH and AcPdAD+ (data not shown). The suggestion (19.Glavas N.A. Bragg P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 297-303Google Scholar) that reduction of AcPdAD+ by NADH in intact transhydrogenase takes place between the domain I polypeptides is therefore unlikely. Other explanations for this reaction are possible (20.Hutton M.N. Day J.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 1041-1051Google Scholar, 21.Bizouarn T. Grimley R.L. Cotton N.P.J. Stilwell S. Hutton M. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 49-58Google Scholar). We have only observed enzyme activity of Ths when it is associated with domain II/III components of transhydrogenase. The ability of wild-type and mutant Ths to reconstitute reverse transhydrogenation activity to R. rubrum membranes depleted of native Ths is compared in Fig. 5. Depleted membranes were prepared by salt washing chromatophores isolated from a strain of R. rubrum that overexpresses wild-type transhydrogenase (see “Materials and Methods”). Experiments were performed with close-to-saturating concentrations of nucleotide substrates. Rates of reverse transhydrogenation with the Tyr235→ Asn and Tyr235→ Phe mutants of Ths were about 18% and 44%, respectively, of wild-type protein, but docking affinities revealed by double-reciprocal plots (data not shown) were undiminished. Dependences of the rate of reverse transhydrogenation on the concentration of AcPdAD+ (saturating NADPH) in the reconstituted systems of depleted chromatophores, and either wild-type or mutant Ths, are shown in Fig. 6A. Double-reciprocal plots (not shown) yielded Km values for AcPdAD+ of approximately 800, 600, and 60 μM in the Tyr235→ Asn and Tyr235→ Phe mutants and wild type, respectively. Because the Km values for AcPdAD+ in the mutants were high, it was not practicable to carry out experiments with saturating concentrations of this nucleotide. Thus, Fig. 6B shows the dependence of reverse transhydrogenation rate on NADPH concentration at 1.1 mM AcPdAD+. Double-reciprocal plots (not shown) gave an approximate apparent Km for NADPH of 15 μM for the Tyr235→ Asn mutant, 15 μM for the Tyr235→ Phe mutant, and 30 μM for wild-type Ths. Rates of light-driven reduction of thio-NADP+ by NADH (forward transhydrogenation) in depleted chromatophores reconstituted, either with mutant or wild-type Ths, were also investigated (Fig. 7). The light drives photosynthetic electron transport, generating a proton electrochemical gradient, which leads to enhanced proton flux through transhydrogenase in its physiological (forward) direction. Depleted membranes were prepared from wild-type chromatophores washed under mild conditions to remove Ths whilst preserving coupling activity. Because the overexpressing strain could not be used, the level of accuracy was lower than in Fig. 6. Fig. 7 shows that maximum rates of light-driven forward transhydrogenation in reconstituted systems were about 2-fold lower for both mutants than for wild-type Ths. Dependences of rates of forward transhydrogenation on nucleotide concentrations (Fig. 7, A and B) show that in both mutants the Km values for thio-NADP+ and for NADH were not significantly different from wild-type Km values of approximately 5 and 4 μM, respectively. Fig. 8 shows that mutant Ths proteins displaced the wild-type protein from its binding site on chromatophores. Addition of wild-type Ths to chromatophores led to a small increase in the rate of reverse transhydrogenation, presumably because some domain I protein was lost from the membranes during preparation(1.Cunningham I.J. Williams R. Palmer T. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 332-338Google Scholar, 4.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Google Scholar). However, addition of either the Tyr235→ Asn or the Tyr235→ Phe mutant Ths resulted in substantial loss of activity, indicating that association-dissociation of domain I with domains II/III of transhydrogenase can occur on the time scale of the experiment. By substituting Tyr235 of wild-type Ths with Phe and Asn, we have tested our prediction that 1H NMR signals at 6.82 and 7.12 ppm in the wild-type protein are attributable to that residue. Complete loss of those resonances from the spectra of both mutants unambiguously confirms the assignment. New, well defined resonances at 7.26 and 7.33 ppm in the Tyr226→ Phe mutant are characteristic of Phe ring protons, and further indicate that the Phe has adopted the mobile nature of the original Tyr. The emergence of new resonances in the Tyr226→ Asn mutant was masked by dithiothreitol present in the sample. Substitution of Tyr235 for Asn also led to changes in resonances assigned to Met residues, notably a marked downfield shift of MetA and a smaller shift in MetC. The assignment of these residues is not yet possible, but is pertinent because the behavior of the MetA resonance reflects events at an intermediate stage of nucleotide binding ((5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar) and (13.Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Quirk P.G. Grimley R.L. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10103-10108Google Scholar); see below). It was suggested (5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar) that MetA might derive from Met239, and experiments are now in progress to test this. Substitution of Tyr235 for Phe also led to shifts of the MetA and MetC resonances and to separation of Ala resonances. The fact that the amino acid residue at position 235 influences the NMR-detectable Met and Ala residues indicates that there is structural organization in the loop even in the absence of nucleotides, but the nature of the interactions is not understood. Evidently protons of the Ala, MetA, and MetC residues can sample more than one environment on the NMR time scale; the effect of the Tyr235 substitution might be to alter the exchange rate between different conformations, or it might result in changes in the chemical shift of the Met and Ala resonances in one of the conformational states, e.g. by altering positions of charged or aromatic groups relative to methyl groups of the amino acid residues. The change from Tyr235 to Asn or to Phe in Ths is not accompanied by gross changes in molecular structure; the protein retains its ability to form dimers and to dock with the domain II/III components of transhydrogenase, the short-wavelength emission of Trp72 is preserved, and, on the basis of NMR spectra, the protein fold and environments of amino acids in the mobile loop (with the exception of MetA, MetC, and Ala residues) are unaffected. Thus, effects of the mutations on nucleotide binding and catalytic properties of the enzyme are likely to be a direct consequence of altered properties of the loop. For both mutants, higher concentrations of NAD+ than for wild-type Ths were required to broaden resonances ascribed to the mobile loop. This might mean either (a) that the Kd for NAD+ is increased by the amino acid substitution, or (b) that differences in exchange rate(s) between Ths, Ths-NAD+, and Ths*-NAD+ (see(5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar)) alter linewidths without affecting the affinity for nucleotide. Similar observations and interpretations apply also to AcPdAD+ and 5‘-AMP in wild-type and mutants. The very large Km for AcPdAD+ of both the mutant proteins, relative to the wild-type, during reverse transhydrogenation (after reconstitution with Ths-depleted membranes) might be another indication of increased Kd for oxidized nucleotide. Thus it is possible that Tyr235 contributes to the binding affinity of Ths for NAD+, AcPdAD+, and 5‘-AMP. This is consistent with the observation that, in the two-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of wild-type 5‘-AMP-Ths complex, NOE interactions were detected between Tyr235 and bound nucleotide(13.Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Quirk P.G. Grimley R.L. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10103-10108Google Scholar). It cannot be determined with confidence whether or not the Tyr235→ Asn or Tyr235→ Phe mutations had a significant effect on binding of reduced nucleotides by Ths. There were no clear differences between the mutant and the wild-type proteins in either the Km values for NADH in forward transhydrogenation (Fig. 7) or the dependences on NADH of the protein-NMR spectra (Figure 2:, Figure 3:), but neither of these give an unambiguous indication of the Kd. The quenching of Trp72 fluorescence by reduced nucleotides (Fig. 4) must also be interpreted with care; because of inner filtering, Kd becomes more subject to error as its value increases beyond 10-20 μM. However, it is reasonable to conclude that substituting Tyr235 with either Asn or Phe does not have a large effect on the affinity of Ths for NADH or AcPdADH. The fact that, in NADH titrations, the new Phe resonances in the Tyr235→ Phe mutant broadened in a similar way to Tyr resonances in wild-type Ths, indicates that the residue can participate in mobile loop closure either with, or without, the 4-OH group. There were minor differences in the NMR spectra recorded in NADH titrations that arose from the fact that alteration of Tyr235 caused shifts in Met and Ala resonances (see above), but evidently the perturbations were not enough greatly to affect binding affinity or loop closure. Mutation of Tyr235 to either Asn or Phe led to decreases in kcat for both forward and reverse transhydrogenation, when the Ths was reconstituted with depleted membranes (Figure 6:, Figure 7:). The loop clearly has a role in catalysis in addition to its fine-tuning effect on the binding affinity of the protein for nucleotide. Whether this is in the hydride transfer reaction, or in conformational coupling with domain II/III components of transhydrogenase, is not known. Although the Tyr235→ Phe mutant Ths had a substantially decreased activity, the Tyr235→ Asn protein was considerably more inhibited, particularly in reverse transhydrogenation. This might indicate that both the aromatic ring and the 4-OH group of Tyr235 are important in the conformational dynamics of the loop in catalysis by wild-type protein. The equivalent of Tyr235 in bovine transhydrogenase (Tyr235) is sensitive to modification by 5‘-[p-(fluorosulfonyl)benzoyl]adenosine(22.Wakabayashi S. Hatefi Y. Biochem. Int. 1987; 15: 915-924Google Scholar). Modified enzyme had reduced catalytic activity; NADH protected against modification. On the basis of this, the equivalent residue in E. coli transhydrogenase (Tyr226) was substituted with His, Leu, Phe, and Asn(6.Olausson T. Hultman T. Holmberg E. Rydstrom J. Ahmad S. Glavas N.A. Bragg P.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13237-13244Google Scholar). In crude membrane fractions isolated from bacteria carrying the mutation, specific activities (mg-1 membrane protein) of AcPdAD+ reduction by NADPH were 33% (or 51% in another strain), 38%, 45% and 42%, respectively, lower than rates in membrane fractions prepared from bacteria carrying wild-type transhydrogenase gene; Km values for AcPdAD+ for the His, Leu, and Phe mutant membranes were, respectively, 3-, 1.9-, and 3-fold larger than those in wild-type membranes. Comparison between mutant and wild-type transhydrogenase in that study is complicated by uncertainty about the level of expression of the enzyme; the transhydrogenase content of the bacterial membranes was assessed from their appearance on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Nevertheless, results of those experiments are broadly consistent with results reported here. In our experiments the statistical significance is assured because we used Ths purified to homogeneity, and the same preparation of membranes for reconstitutions with both wild-type and mutant proteins. Because the domain I protein of E. coli does not exist as a discrete polypeptide, this strategy is unavailable in that system. In our experiments, reverse transhydrogenation activities of Tyr235 mutants of R. rubrum transhydrogenase were more inhibited, relative to wild-type, than Tyr226 mutants of E. coli transhydrogenase, and Km values of the mutants were increased by a much larger factor. There might also be real species differences between the two enzymes. The GYA motif of the loop (5.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Google Scholar) is conserved in known transhydrogenase sequences, but there is only low homology among other residues in the region; there are no other invariant amino acid residues, although small and charged residues preponderate. There is often greater variation in amino acid sequence of surface loops because individual residues make only a small contribution to the global structure. It is likely in transhydrogenase that, during closure, multiple contacts are made between the loop and the rest of the protein or bound nucleotide, and therefore, in individual species, single amino acid substitutions in the loop might have greater or lesser effects on catalysis. Uniquely in the R. rubrum enzyme effects of mutations on nucleotide binding, interaction between domains, conformational dynamics of the mobile loop, and the Michaelis parameters can be assessed separately. The present experiments establish that Tyr235 is important in the dynamics of mobile loop closure, and that substitution of the residue profoundly affects the Michaelis parameters, thus, for the first time, establishing a pivotal role for loop closure in catalysis. We are grateful to Drs. John Hobman and Ken Jakeman for their help in the mutagenesis procedure, and for bacterial strains and plasmids, and to Dr. Barry A. Levine for continued advice and encouragement on the NMR spectroscopy."
