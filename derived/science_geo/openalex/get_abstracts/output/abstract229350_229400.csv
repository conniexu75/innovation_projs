https://openalex.org/W2118295263,"Bringing together leaf trait data spanning 2,548 species and 175 sites we describe, for the first time at global scale, a universal spectrum of leaf economics consisting of key chemical, structural and physiological properties. The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate."

https://openalex.org/W2162076236,"Neutron stars are some of the densest manifestations of massive objects in the universe. They are ideal astrophysical laboratories for testing theories of dense matter physics and provide connections among nuclear physics, particle physics and astrophysics. Neutron stars may exhibit conditions and phenomena not observed elsewhere, such as hyperon-dominated matter, deconfined quark matter, superfluidity and superconductivity with critical temperatures near ${10^{10}}$ kelvin, opaqueness to neutrinos, and magnetic fields in excess of $10^{13}$ Gauss. Here, we describe the formation, structure, internal composition and evolution of neutron stars. Observations that include studies of binary pulsars, thermal emission from isolated neutron stars, glitches from pulsars and quasi-periodic oscillations from accreting neutron stars provide information about neutron star masses, radii, temperatures, ages and internal compositions."

https://openalex.org/W2064869244,"How can neural activity propagate through cortical networks built with weak, stochastic synapses? We find precise repetitions of spontaneous patterns of synaptic inputs in neocortical neurons in vivo and in vitro. These patterns repeat after minutes, maintaining millisecond accuracy. Calcium imaging of slices reveals reactivation of sequences of cells during the occurrence of repeated intracellular synaptic patterns. The spontaneous activity drifts with time, engaging different cells. Sequences of active neurons have distinct spatial structures and are repeated in the same order over tens of seconds, revealing modular temporal dynamics. Higher order sequences are replayed with compressed timing."
https://openalex.org/W2114881821,"Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the ubiquitination of proteins that are important in the survival of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). We show that parkin is S- nitrosylated in vitro, as well as in vivo in a mouse model of PD and in brains of patients with PD and diffuse Lewy body disease. Moreover, S- nitrosylation inhibits parkin's ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and its protective function. The inhibition of parkin's ubiquitin E3 ligase activity by S- nitrosylation could contribute to the degenerative process in these disorders by impairing the ubiquitination of parkin substrates."

https://openalex.org/W2027565428,"To understand the computations performed by the input layers of cortical structures, it is essential to determine the relationship between sensory-evoked synaptic input and the resulting pattern of output spikes. In the cerebellum, granule cells constitute the input layer, translating mossy fibre signals into parallel fibre input to Purkinje cells. Until now, their small size and dense packing have precluded recordings from individual granule cells in vivo. Here we use whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to show the relationship between mossy fibre synaptic currents evoked by somatosensory stimulation and the resulting granule cell output patterns. Granule cells exhibited a low ongoing firing rate, due in part to dampening of excitability by a tonic inhibitory conductance mediated by GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors. Sensory stimulation produced bursts of mossy fibre excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) that summate to trigger bursts of spikes. Notably, these spike bursts were evoked by only a few quantal EPSCs, and yet spontaneous mossy fibre inputs triggered spikes only when inhibition was reduced. Our results reveal that the input layer of the cerebellum balances exquisite sensitivity with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Granule cell bursts are optimally suited to trigger glutamate receptor activation and plasticity at parallel fibre synapses, providing a link between input representation and memory storage in the cerebellum."

https://openalex.org/W2059560225,"We report the synthesis of a new nanocrystal (NC) mesophase through self-assembly of water-soluble NC micelles with soluble silica. The mesophase comprises gold nanocrystals arranged within a silica matrix in a face-centered cubic lattice with cell dimensions that are adjustable through control of the nanocrystal diameter and/or the alkane chain lengths of the primary alkanethiol stabilizing ligands or the surrounding secondary surfactants. Under kinetically controlled silica polymerization conditions, evaporation drives self-assembly of NC micelles into ordered NC/silica thin-film mesophases during spin coating. The intermediate NC micelles are water soluble and of interest for biolabeling. Initial experiments on a metal-insulator-metal capacitor fabricated with an ordered three-dimensional gold nanocrystal/silica array as the ""insulator"" demonstrated collective Coulomb blockade behavior below 100 kelvin and established the current-voltage scaling relationship for a well-defined three-dimensional array of Coulomb islands."
https://openalex.org/W2040754208,"In mammals, the resetting of DNA methylation patterns in early embryos and germ cells is crucial for development. Two DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, are responsible for the creation of DNA methylation patterns. Dnmt3L, a member of the Dnmt3 family, has been reported to be necessary for maternal methylation imprinting, possibly by interacting with Dnmt3a and/or Dnmt3b (Hata, K., Okano, M., Lei, H., and Li, E. (2002) Development 129, 1983-1993). In the present study, the effect of DNMT3L, a human homologue of Dnmt3L, on the DNA methylation activity of mouse Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b was examined in vitro. DNMT3L enhanced the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b about 1.5-3-fold in a dose-dependent manner but did not enhance the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt1. Although the extents of stimulation were different, a stimulatory effect on the DNA methylation activity was observed for all of the substrate DNA sequences examined, such as those of the maternally methylated SNRPN and Lit-1 imprinting genes, the paternally methylated H19 imprinting gene, the CpG island of the myoD gene, the 5 S ribosomal RNA gene, an artificial 28-bp DNA, poly(dG-dC)-poly(dG-dC), and poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC). DNMT3L could not bind to DNA but could bind to Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, indicating that the stimulatory effect of DNMT3L on the DNA methylation activity may not be due to the guiding of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b to the targeting DNA sequence but may comprise a direct effect on their catalytic activity. The carboxyl-terminal half of DNMT3L was found to be responsible for the enhancement of the enzyme activity.

In vertebrates, position 5 of cytosine residues in CpG sequences in genomic DNA is usually methylated (1Antequera F. Bird A. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 169-185Google Scholar). DNA methylation of the genome is essential for mammalian development and plays crucial roles in a variety of biological processes, such as genomic imprinting (2Jaenisch R.

In vertebrates, two types of DNA methyltransferase activities have been reported, i.e. de novo and maintenance types. During mouse development, genomic DNA is globally demethylated in the preimplantation stage and methylated after implantation (8Monk M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Genome-wide methylation also occurs during gametogenesis in both male and female germ cells and is believed to be involved in the establishment of genomic imprinting. Sex-specific DNA methylation at differently methylated regions (DMRs) 1The abbreviations used are: DMR, differently methylated region; Dnmt3L, DNA methyltransferase 3-like; PHD, plant homeodomain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DNMT3L-N, amino-terminal half of DNMT3L; DNMT3L-C, carboxyl-terminal half of DNMT3L; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; 5 S rDNA, 5 S ribosomal RNA gene.1The abbreviations used are: DMR, differently methylated region; Dnmt3L, DNA methyltransferase 3-like; PHD, plant homeodomain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DNMT3L-N, amino-terminal half of DNMT3L; DNMT3L-C, carboxyl-terminal half of DNMT3L; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; 5 S rDNA, 5 S ribosomal RNA gene. in imprinted genes regulates the allele-specific expression of the imprinted genes. Once the methylation patterns have been established, they are inherited in a cell lineage-specific manner according to the maintenance activity. Dnmt1, one of the DNA methyltransferases, is responsible for maintenance of the DNA methylation patterns (9Bestor T. Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 10Tajima S. Suetake I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are essential for de novo DNA methylation in postimplantation embryos (11Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 12Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4411) Google Scholar). Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b show similar kinetic parameters (13Aoki A. Suetake I. Miyagawa J. Fujio T. Chijiwa T. Sasaki H. Tajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3506-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 14Suetake I. Miyazaki J. Murakami C. Takeshima H. Tajima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and thus genetically compensate for each other, although only partially. However, the timing and tissue specificity of their expression are quite distinct (15Watanabe D. Suetake I. Tada T. Tajima S. Mech. Dev. 2002; 118: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).DNA methyltransferase 3-like (Dnmt3L) protein possesses a plant homeodomain (PHD)-like motif that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b also have (16Aapola U. Kawasaki K. Scott H.S. Ollila L. Vihinen M. Heino M. Shintani A. Kawasaki K. Minoshima S. Krohn K. Antonarakis S.E. Shimizu N. Kudoh J. Peterson P. Genomics. 2000; 65: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because Dnmt3L does not have any of the motifs conserved in DNA methyltransferases, it may not exhibit DNA methylation activity (16Aapola U. Kawasaki K. Scott H.S. Ollila L. Vihinen M. Heino M. Shintani A. Kawasaki K. Minoshima S. Krohn K. Antonarakis S.E. Shimizu N. Kudoh J. Peterson P. Genomics. 2000; 65: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 17Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Dnmt3L has been genetically shown to be necessary for the DMR methylation of maternally imprinted genes and spermatogenesis (17Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bourc'his D. Xu G.L. Lin C.S. Bollman B. Bestor T.H. Science. 2001; 294: 2536-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Because ectopically expressed Dnmt3L and Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b interact with each other (17Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Dnmt3L is assumed to target Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b specifically to the DMRs of imprinted genes or to facilitate genome-wide de novo methylation by stimulating the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b. In mammalian cells, co-expression of DNMT3L, a human homologue of Dnmt3L, with Dnmt3a results in marked stimulation of the de novo methylation of ectopically expressed episomes and transgenes including maternally methylated imprinting genes not exhibiting sequence specificity (19Chédin F. Lieber M.R. Hsieh C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16916-16921Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also shown that co-expression of DNMT3L with DNMT3B, a human homologue of mouse Dnmt3b, also resulted in stimulation of de novo methylation activity, 2F. Chédin, personal communication.2F. Chédin, personal communication. which is distinct from the previous report (19Chédin F. Lieber M.R. Hsieh C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16916-16921Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The results indicate an important point. That is, DNMT3L may not guide Dnmt3a to a specific sequence such as the DMR of imprinted genes, at least not in somatic cells.It is not known what the molecular mechanism underlying the up-regulation of the de novo DNA methylation by Dnmt3L is. In the present study, to address this issue, we examined the in vitro effect of DNMT3L on the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b using purified proteins. As in the experiment involving cells, DNMT3L stimulated the DNA methylation activity of both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, the stimulation being due to a direct interaction between DNMT3L and Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b. Similar to the findings of the previous study involving cells, the stimulation was not DNA sequence-specific. We determined that the region responsible for the stimulation was the carboxyl-terminal half of DNMT3L.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—The cDNA of human DNMT3L in pcDNA3.1/myc-His (pDNMT3L-myc) was kindly provided by Dr. Pärt Peterson (University of Tampere, Finland). The coding sequence encoding 387 amino acid residues from the initiation Met (ATG) to the termination site was ligated into the multicloning site of pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Truncated forms of human DNMT3L, which encodes the amino-terminal sequence, including a PHD-like motif and a nuclear localization signal (1-195), and the carboxyl-terminal sequence (160-387), were PCR-amplified with recombinant Taq (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan) and then subcloned into pGEX-6P-1. All the PCR-amplified fragments were subcloned, and then their nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy method (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52361) Google Scholar). Mouse Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b1 cDNAs were ligated into pcDNA3 (pDnmt3a and pDnmt3b) (Invitrogen).Protein Expression and Purification—The recombinant Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b expressed in Sf9 cells were purified as described elsewhere (14Suetake I. Miyazaki J. Murakami C. Takeshima H. Tajima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Iida T. Suetake I. Tajima S. Morioka H. Ohta S. Obuse C. Turimoto T. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The human DNMT3L and its truncated forms were expressed in BL21-Codon Plus-RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at 18 °C after 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside treatment. The harvested cells were extracted according to the manufacturer's manual except that the sonicated whole-cell suspension was treated with 80 units/ml Benzonase (Merck) for 1 h at room temperature. All of the purification steps thereafter were performed at 4 °C or on ice. The solubilized proteins were purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused amino-terminal half of DNMT3L (GST-DNMT3L-N) was purified on HiTrap Q (Amersham Biosciences) with a linear gradient of NaCl, from 0.1 to 0.6 m, in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1/1,000 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The purified proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1/1,000 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture. Protein concentrations were determined by the method described by Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.DNA Methylation Activity—DNA methylation activity was determined as described elsewhere (14Suetake I. Miyazaki J. Murakami C. Takeshima H. Tajima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In brief, the methylation reaction mixture contained 40 nm Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b, the indicated amount of GST-DNMT3L (or one of its truncated forms or GST), 4 μg/ml DNA, and 5.3 μmS-[3H]adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) (15 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in 25 μl of reaction buffer (R buffer) comprising 2.7 m glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). After the incubation, the radioactivity was determined with a scintillation counter.Methyl Group Acceptors for Determination of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b Activity—As methyl group acceptors for determination of the DNA methylation activity, the following DNAs were used: poly(dI-dC)poly(dI-dC), poly(dG-dC)-poly(dG-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), a 28-mer double-stranded DNA with the sequence of 5′-TGTTGTGGGTCAGCGCCTGATACTGTAC-3′, the Xenopus borealis 5 S ribosomal RNA gene (5 S rDNA) fragment (217 bp) excised from pX5S197′ (23Ura K.

Bartolomei M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4322-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The clones coding the X. borealis 5 S rDNA, Lit-1, and SNRPN were kindly provided by Drs. Kiyoe Ura (Medical School, Osaka University), Tsunehiro Mukai (Saga Medical University), and Mitsuyoshi Nakao (Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University), respectively.Gel Shift Assay—The conditions for binding of proteins to DNA were identical to those for determination of the DNA methylation activity, except for the use of cold AdoMet. The AdoMet used in this study was purified on a Sep-Pak C18 column (Waters Associates) before use. After the incubation, the reaction mixtures were incubated with or without anti-GST polyclonal antibodies at 0 °C for 30 min and then loaded onto 0.7% agarose gels and electrophoresed in 1× Tris/acetate/EDTA buffer. The gels were stained with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then the DNA bands were determined with a Fluor Imager 595 (Amersham Biosciences).Determination of Direct Interaction of DNMT3L with Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b—To examine the direct interaction between DNMT3L and Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b in vitro, 1.2 μm GST or GST-DNMT3L protein, 40 nm Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b, and 5.3 μm cold AdoMet in 100 μl of R buffer were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After the incubation, 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (50% v/v) equilibrated with R buffer was added, followed by further incubation on ice for 2 h. The matrix was washed four times with 100 μl of R buffer each time. Input, unbound, wash, and matrix-bound fractions were loaded onto 7.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with SYPRO Orange (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then the protein bands were determined with a Fluor Imager 595.To examine the interaction between DNMT3L and Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b in vivo, human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with pDNMT3L-myc and pDnmt3a or pDnmt3b using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24-h recovery, the cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and then solubilized with 0.3 m NaCl, 0.3 (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 m sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 1/1,000 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 63 units/ml Benzonase. DNMT3L and Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b thus extracted were immunoprecipitated either with anti-myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) coupled to Sepharose or with anti-Dnmt3a or -Dnmt3b polyclonal antibodies and protein A-Sepharose. The bound proteins were determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels. Electroblotting and immunodetection were performed as described elsewhere (27Shi L. Suetake I. Kawakami T. Aimoto S. Tajima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Antibodies—Antibodies against Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b were prepared as described elsewhere (13Aoki A. Suetake I. Miyagawa J. Fujio T. Chijiwa T. Sasaki H. Tajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3506-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).RESULTSDNA Methyltransferase Activity of Mouse Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b Is Stimulated in Vitro by Human DNMT3L—It has been genetically proven that Dnmt3L is necessary for the maternal methylation of imprinted genes (17Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bourc'his D. Xu G.L. Lin C.S. Bollman B. Bestor T.H. Science. 2001; 294: 2536-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Interestingly, human DNMT3L stimulates the de novo DNA methylation activity of co-expressed mouse Dnmt3a (19Chédin F. Lieber M.R. Hsieh C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16916-16921Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and human DNMT3B. 2F. Chédin, personal communication. This indicates that both Dnmt3a and DNMT3B functionally interact with DNMT3L in vivo.We examined whether or not the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b is enhanced by DNMT3L in vitro. For this, recombinant mouse Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt1 expressed in Sf9 cells (14Suetake I. Miyazaki J. Murakami C. Takeshima H. Tajima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Iida T. Suetake I. Tajima S. Morioka H. Ohta S. Obuse C. Turimoto T. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and recombinant human DNMT3L expressed as a fusion protein with GST (GST-DNMT3L) in Escherichia coli (Fig. 1A) were prepared. GST-DNMT3L stimulated the DNA methylation activity of mouse Dnmt3a in a dose-dependent manner, the maximum stimulation of about 1.4-1.5-fold being observed with above a 10-molar excess of GST-DNMT3L as to DNA substrates poly(dG-dC)-poly(dG-dC) and poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Fig. 1B). Similar to Dnmt3a, GSTDNMT3L stimulated the activity of Dnmt3b (Fig. 1C). More than 2-fold stimulation was observed for Dnmt3b, this stimulation being higher than that of Dnmt3a, in the presence of a 30-molar excess of GST-DNMT3L. Note that the activity of Dnmt1 was not stimulated on the addition of DNMT3L (Fig. 1D). This indicates that the stimulatory effect of DNMT3L on the enzyme activity was specific for Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b.DNMT3L Stimulates the Methylation Activity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b Irrespective of the Sequence—The finding that GSTDNMT3L stimulated the enzyme activity even when poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) or poly(dG-dC)-poly(dG-dC) was used as the methyl acceptor suggests that DNMT3L does not guide Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b to a specific DNA sequence. Dnmt3L has been reported to be a necessary component for the methylation of imprinted genes in oocytes (17Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bourc'his D. Xu G.L. Lin C.S. Bollman B. Bestor T.H. Science. 2001; 294: 2536-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). At the same time, it has also been reported that ectopically expressed DNMT3L and Dnmt3a stimulate de novo DNA methylation of non-imprinted DNA sequences (19Chédin F. Lieber M.R. Hsieh C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16916-16921Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar).We next examined whether or not DNMT3L affects the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in a sequence-dependent manner in vitro. For this, we used two imprinted sequences of the DMR of the mouse Lit-1 and human SNRPN genes, which are methylated in maternal germ cells (24Yatsuki H. Joh K. Higashimoto K. Soejima H. Arai Y.

Orstavik K.H. Tommerup N. Ledbetter D.H. Beaudet A.L. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), as methyl acceptors. The effects of DNMT3L on the methylation activity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b toward these sequences were determined. As shown in Fig. 2A-D, GST-DNMT3L stimulated the activity of both Dnmt3a (A and C) and Dnmt3b (B and D). Enhancement of the methylation activity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b was also observed when the DMR of the paternally imprinted mouse H19 gene was used as the substrate (Fig. 2, E and F). To determine whether the stimulatory effect of DNMT3L on Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b is directed toward non-imprinted DNA sequences, we determined the effect of GSTDNMT3L on the 28-bp sequence containing a pair of CpGs (Fig. 2, G and H), the 5 S rDNA fragment (Fig. 2, I and J), or the CpG island of the mouse myoD gene (Fig. 2, K and L). Although the extents of stimulation were slightly different, the methylation activity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b stimulated by GST-DNMT3L was directed toward all the examined sequences, irrespective of their origin. The results clearly indicate that the stimulatory effect of DNMT3L is not due to the guiding of Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b to a specific sequence for methylation.Fig. 2DNMT3L stimulates the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b irrespective of the sequence. The effects of DNMT3L on the DNA methylation activities of Dnmt3a (A, C, E, G, I, and K) and Dnmt3b (B, D, F, H, J, and L) were determined using various DNA substrates. The DNA methylation activities were titrated with either GST-DNMT3L (filled circles; 3L) or GST (open circles; GST). The DNA substrates were the DMR of Lit-1 (A and B), the DMR of SNRPN (C and D), the DMR of H19 (E and F), 28-bp DNA containing a pair of CpGs (G and H), 5 S rDNA (I and J), and the CpG island of myoD (K and L).

Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because the de novo DNA methylation activity of Dnmt3a is stimulated by DNMT3L in vivo (19Chédin F. Lieber M.R. Hsieh C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16916-16921Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), it was suggested that a direct interaction between Dnmt3L (DNMT3L) and Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b is the molecular basis of the function of Dnmt3L (DNMT3L). As GST-DNMT3L stimulated the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in vitro (see Figs. 1 and 2), it is reasonable to assume that DNMT3L directly interacts with Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. We next examined the interaction between DNMT3L and Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b in vitro. After 1-h incubation under identical conditions to those for the determination of DNA methylation activity, the mixture was subjected to gel shift assaying (Fig. 3). When GST-DNMT3L and the 5 S rDNA fragment were incubated together, a shifted DNA band was not observed, indicating that GST-DNMT3L cannot bind to 5 S rDNA (Fig. 3, A and B). On the contrary, after the incubation of Dnmt3a with 5 S rDNA, a retarded DNA band was observed, indicating that Dnmt3a can bind to the DNA (Fig. 3A). When Dnmt3a and GST-DNMT3L were incubated with 5 S rDNA, the shifted band showed slightly slower mobility compared with when Dnmt3a alone was incubated with 5 S rDNA. When antibodies against GST were added to the mixture containing GST-DNMT3L, Dnmt3a, and 5 S rDNA, the shifted DNA band disappeared due to a supershift (Fig. 3A). This indicates that DNMT3L was associated with a complex of 5 S rDNA and Dnmt3a. An identical experiment was performed for Dnmt3b (Fig. 3B). Similar to Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b associated with GST-DNMT3L on 5 S rDNA with the exception that the shifted band of DNA associated with Dnmt3b and GST-DNMT3L moved slightly faster than in the absence of GST-DNMT3L. This may indicate that the complex comprising DNA and Dnmt3b contains multiple numbers of Dnmt3b and that the presence of DNMT3L caused their dissociation. Because GST-DNMT3L could not bind to 5 S rDNA by itself, GST-DNMT3L is expected to interact directly with Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b.Fig. 3DNMT3L forms a complex with Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b on DNA. After incubation under identical buffer conditions to those for DNA methylation activity measurement, except for the use of non-radiolabeled AdoMet, the protein-DNA complex was detected by gel shift assaying in a 0.7% agarose gel. Incubation was performed in the presence (+) or absence (-) of 40 nm Dnmt3a (A) or Dnmt3b (B), 1.2 μm GST-DNMT3L or GST, and 4 μg/ml 5 S rDNA. The reaction mixture was treated with (+) or without (-) anti-GST antibodies. DNA was detected with SYBR Green I.

After the incubation, GST-DNMT3L was pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose, and then co-precipitation of Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b was examined (Fig. 4). When GST-DNMT3L and Dnmt3a were incubated together and then precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose, Dnmt3a was significantly recovered in the matrix fraction (Fig. 4A, right panel), whereas Dnmt3a was not recovered in the matrix fraction in the absence and presence of GST-DNMT3L and GST, respectively (Fig. 4A). Because the binding activity was determined under identical conditions to those for determination of the DNA methylation activity, Dnmt3a bound to DNMT3L during DNA methylation. Similarly, the interaction between Dnmt3b and GST-DNMT3L was examined (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4B, Dnmt3b also bound to GST-DNMT3L. In the “input” and “bound” lanes in the presence of GST-DNMT3L, minor bands corresponding to below 66 kDa were observed. Most of the minor bands were seen for the fraction bound to glutathione-Sepharose. Therefore, the bands were assumed to represent nicked products of GST-DNMT3L arising during the incubation. To evaluate the relative binding affinity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b for DNMT3L, identical amounts of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b were incubated with GSTDNMT3L and then pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose (Fig. 4C). The amounts of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b recovered in the matrix fraction were almost identical, suggesting that the affinities of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b for DNMT3L are similar.Fig. 4DNMT3L binds to Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in the absence of DNA. After incubation under identical buffer conditions to those for DNA methylation activity measurement of Dnmt3a (A) and Dnmt3b (B), except for the omission of DNA, GST-DNMT3L and GST were pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose. Half of the input (I), unbound (U), wash (W), and bound (B) fractions, respectively, were separated on an SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel.

Growing corticospinal and somatosensory axons cross the midline in the medulla to reach their targets and thus form the basis of contralateral motor control and sensory input. The motor and sensory projections appeared uncrossed in patients with horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS). In patients affected with HGPPS, we identified mutations in the ROBO3 gene, which shares homology with roundabout genes important in axon guidance in developing Drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse.

https://openalex.org/W1970199527,"Physical forces elicit biochemical signalling in a diverse array of cells, tissues and organisms1,2,3, helping to govern fundamental biological processes. Several hypotheses have been advanced that link physical forces to intracellular signalling pathways, but in many cases the molecular mechanisms of mechanotransduction remain elusive1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Here we find that compressive stress shrinks the lateral intercellular space surrounding epithelial cells, and triggers cellular signalling via autocrine binding of epidermal growth factor family ligands to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Mathematical analysis predicts that constant rate shedding of autocrine ligands into a collapsing lateral intercellular space leads to increased local ligand concentrations that are sufficient to account for the observed receptor signalling; direct experimental comparison of signalling stimulated by compressive stress versus exogenous soluble ligand supports this prediction. These findings establish a mechanism by which mechanotransduction arises from an autocrine ligand–receptor circuit operating in a dynamically regulated extracellular volume, not requiring induction of force-dependent biochemical processes within the cell or cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2063075327,"Most animal species are infected with multiple parasite species; however, the role of interspecific parasite interactions in influencing parasite dynamics and shaping parasite communities has been unclear. Although laboratory studies have found evidence of cross-immunity, immunosuppression and competition, analyses of hosts in the field have generally concluded that parasite communities are little more than random assemblages. Here we present evidence of consistent interspecific interactions in a natural mammalian system, revealed through the analysis of parasite intensity data collected from a free-ranging rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) population, sampled monthly for a period of 23 yr. The wild rabbit plays host to a diverse gut helminth community that reflects the communities seen in other economically important domestic herbivores. These findings suggest that parasite interactions could have profound implications for the dynamics of parasite communities. The efficacy of parasite control programmes could be jeopardized if such interactions are not taken into account. In contrast, a clear understanding of such interactions may provide the basis for the development of more environmentally acceptable methods of parasite control."

They therefore act as very precise, stable, moving clocks that allow us to investigate a large set of otherwise inaccessible astrophysical problems. The orbital parameters derived from high-precision binary pulsar timing provide constraints on binary evolution, characteristics of the binary pulsar population, and the masses of neutron stars with different mass-transfer histories. These binary systems also test gravitational theories, setting strong limits on deviations from general relativity. Surveys for new pulsars yield new binary systems that increase our understanding of all these fields and may open up whole new areas of physics, as most spectacularly evidenced by the recent discovery of an extremely relativistic double-pulsar system."

We tested the hypothesis that enhanced fatty acid oxidation in myocytes should protect against fatty acid-induced insulin resistance by limiting lipid accumulation. L6 myotubes were transduced with adenoviruses encoding carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) isoforms or β-galactosidase (control). Two to 3-fold overexpression of L-CPT I, the endogenous isoform in L6 cells, proportionally increased oxidation of the long-chain fatty acids palmitate and oleate and increased insulin stimulation of [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen by 60% while enhancing insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of p38MAPK. Incubation of control cells with 0.2 mm palmitate for 18 h caused accumulation of triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, and ceramide (but not long-chain acyl-CoA) and decreased insulin-stimulated [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen (60%), [3H]deoxyglucose uptake (60%), and protein kinase B phosphorylation (20%). In the context of L-CPT I overexpression, palmitate preincubation produced a relative decrease in insulin-stimulated incorporation of [14C]glucose into glycogen (60%) and [3H]deoxyglucose uptake (40%) but did not inhibit phosphorylation of protein kinase B. Due to the enhancement of insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism induced by L-CPT I overexpression itself, net insulin-stimulated incorporation of [14C]glucose into glycogen and [3H]deoxyglucose uptake in L-CPT I-transduced, palmitate-treated cells were significantly greater than in palmitate-treated control cells (71 and 75% greater, respectively).

Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is frequently present in obesity and is an early characteristic of the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

A possible causal relationship has been proposed in which the high plasma fatty acid levels frequently observed in the obese/insulin-resistant state drive muscle lipid accumulation that in turn causes a predisposition toward decreased insulin sensitivity and worsening of the disease, the so-called “lipotoxic” model of skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from a series of in vivo model systems in which artificial elevations in plasma fatty acid levels over several hours induced lipid build-up and insulin resistance in muscle tissue (7Boden G.

Parallel observations have been made in vitro in which incubation of model muscle cells in tissue culture with fatty acids has analogous consequences (11Schmitz-Peiffer C. Craig D.L. Biden T.J. J.

Although the association between increased intramyocellular lipid and the development of insulin resistance is compelling, the mechanism of the effect is far from clear. For example, triacylglycerol accumulation in muscle cells is not invariably associated with insulin resistance. Notably the muscle of trained endurance athletes has been shown to be highly insulin-sensitive despite the presence of high levels of intramyocellular triacylglycerol (14Goodpaster B.H. He J. Watkins S. Kelley D.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 5755-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), and shorter term (4-week) exercise training in humans appears to improve muscle insulin sensitivity in the absence of measurable changes in muscle triacylglycerol content (15Helge J.W. Dela F. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1881-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To account for this apparent discrepancy, it has been proposed that triglyceride accumulation within insulin-resistant muscle is merely a marker for some other harmful fatty acid-derived metabolite(s). In particular, diacylglycerol (16Schmitz-Peiffer C. Browne C.L. Oakes N.D. Watkinson A. Chisholm D.J. Kraegen E.W. Biden T.J.

It is likely, therefore, that a decreased ability to oxidize fatty acids in the muscle of these individuals may exacerbate lipid accumulation particularly in the context of elevated plasma free fatty acid levels. If this mechanism is correct, we hypothesized that, conversely, an intervention that promoted β-oxidation in muscle cells should protect against fatty acid-induced insulin resistance by ameliorating intramyocellular lipid accumulation. We tested this hypothesis by developing a strategy to accelerate β-oxidation in rat L6 myotubes, a muscle-derived cell line that displays a robust response to insulin (30Niu W. Huang C. Nawaz Z. Levy M. Somwar R. Li D. Bilan P.J. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17953-17962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Specifically we overexpressed the enzyme CPT I, the first step in the CPT pathway that permits the entry of long-chain acyl-CoA into the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation (31McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, CPT I acts on cytosolic long-chain acyl-CoA, transferring the acyl group from CoA to carnitine. The acyl-carnitine formed can enter the matrix (via a specific transporter) where acyl-CoA is regenerated through the action of a distinct gene product, CPT II, that reverses the CPT I reaction. CPT I is tightly regulated by virtue of its sensitivity to inhibition by malonyl-CoA and is believed to be a major control point for β-oxidation in all tissues where fatty acid oxidation occurs (31McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). CPT I is known to exist in at least two isoforms, denoted L-CPT I and M-CPT I, each found in several tissue and cell types (31McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar, 32Brown N.F. Hill J.K. Esser V. Kirkland J.L. Corkey B.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 2Recently an mRNA encoding a putative third isoform of CPT I has been identified in rat brain and testis. However, the catalytic function of the encoded protein is unclear (33Price N.T. van der Leij F.R. Jackson V.N. Corstorphine C.G. Thomson R. Sorensen A. Zammit V.A. Genomics. 2002; 80: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We determined the effect of CPT I overexpression on β-oxidation, lipid accumulation, the metabolic response to insulin, and the ability of the hormone to stimulate certain signaling pathways involved in insulin regulation of muscle glucose metabolism and believed to be relevant to fatty acid-induced insulin resistance. These studies demonstrated that overexpression of CPT I increases the rate of fatty acid oxidation by muscle cells and significantly improves the insulin response, metabolically and at the level of the insulin signaling pathway, and furthermore is protective against fatty acid-induced insulin resistance. However, remarkably these improvements were not associated with decreased accumulation of intramyocellular lipids. The data provide compelling evidence for a beneficial effect of increased β-oxidation on insulin sensitivity by a mechanism independent of lipid accumulation. Materials—Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen (α-minimum Eagle's medium), Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA (Eagle's minimum essential medium and fetal bovine serum (FBS)), BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), United States Biological, Swampscott, MA (chicken embryo extract), and Hyclone, South Logan, UT (horse serum). [9,10-3H]Palmitic acid, [3H]H2O, and 2-[3H]deoxy-d-glucose were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; [8-3H]octanoic acid, [9,10-3H]oleic acid and l-[N-methyl-14C]carnitine were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO); and d-[U-14C]glucose was from Amersham Biosciences. Antibodies were from Sigma (anti-actin) and Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA (others). sn-1,2-diacylglycerol kinase was from Calbiochem. Cell Culture and Treatment—Stock cultures of rat L6 skeletal muscle cells were grown in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Growth Medium) (30Niu W.

For experimental procedures, stocks were trypsinized and reseeded in 6-well plates at a density of 4000 cells/cm2. After 24 h (∼80% confluence) the medium was changed to α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 2% (v/v) FBS and antibiotics as above (Differentiation Medium) that was replaced after 2 and 4 days of culture. After 6 days, myotube differentiation was complete, and experimental procedures were initiated. Stock cultures of other myocyte cell lines were grown, reseeded for experimentation, and induced to differentiate as above with the following variations. For C2C12 cells, Growth Medium was Eagle's minimum essential medium, 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin with Differentiation Medium being the same but with 1% FBS (11Schmitz-Peiffer C. Craig D.L. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24202-24210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). For MC13 cells Growth Medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, 10% horse serum, 0.5% (v/v) chicken embryo extract, penicillin, streptomycin with each of the sera reduced to 1% in the Differentiation Medium (34Lee J.Y. Qu-Petersen Z. Cao B. Kimura S. Janowski R. Cummins J. Usas A. Gates C. Robbins P. Wernig A. Huard J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1085-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Primary cells were prepared hind limb muscle of neonatal rats enriched for myoblast content and grown on collagen-coated dishes by the method of Springer et al. (35Springer M.L. Rando T. Blau H.M. Boyle A.L. Current Protocols in Human Genetics. John Wiley and Sons, New York1997: 13.14.11-13.14.19Google Scholar). Growth Medium was Ham's F-10 nutrient mixture containing 20% (v/v) FBS, 2.5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, and antibiotics as above. Differentiation Medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% (v/v) horse serum plus antibiotics. Adenovirus Preparation and Transduction of L6 and C2C12 Cells— Adenoviruses (a kind gift of the laboratory of J. Denis McGarry, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX) contained the cDNAs encoding Escherichia coli β-galactosidase or rat L-CPT I, M-CPT I, or CPT II under the control of the early cytomegalovirus promoter (36Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Viral stocks/cell lysates were prepared with the human embryonal kidney cell line 293A as host (36Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and used directly for cell transduction. For functional titration of AdV-L-CPT I and all subsequent experiments with that virus, a concentrated viral stock was prepared (36Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). For all experiments, an equivalent titer of AdV-β-gal, prepared in an identical fashion, was used to transduce control cells (lysate or concentrate as appropriate). Adenoviral transduction of L6 cells was performed after 6 days of differentiation or 4 days for C2C12. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 1 ml of serum-free medium to which was added 100 μl of lysate or a volume of concentrated virus as indicated in the figure legends. The medium was then aspirated, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fresh Differentiation Medium was added. In all cases, culture was continued for a further 24 h to allow expression of the virally encoded proteins before commencing each of the procedures described below. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from fully differentiated myotubes (after 6 days of differentiation) or adult rat heart using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). RNA species were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, and messages for L- or M-CPT I were detected using 32P-labeled single-stranded DNA probes that hybridize efficiently with both the rat and mouse messages (32Brown N.F. Hill J.K. Esser V. Kirkland J.L. Corkey B.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CPT Assay—Activities of CPT I and II were determined by a radiochemical assay in the direction of acylcarnitine formation as described previously (37Brown N.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 228: 281-301PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly cells were harvested in a buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and broken with a glass homogenizer. The cell homogenate, in which the mitochondria remain largely intact, was used directly for assay of CPT I. For assay of CPT II, a portion of the homogenate was adjusted to 1% (w/v) with regard to the detergent octylglucoside, which inactivates CPT I and releases CPT II from the mitochondrial matrix in active form (38Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9822-9827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty Acid Oxidation—Fatty acids (palmitate, oleate, or octanoate) were preconjugated with essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) to generate a stock solution of 25% (w/v) BSA, 4 mm fatty acid in serum-free medium (39Berry M.N. Edwards A.M. Barritt G.J. Burdon R.H. van Knippenberg P.H. Isolated Hepatocytes: Preparation, Properties and Applications. Elsevier Publishing, Amsterdam1991: 172-173Google Scholar). [3H]Palmitate, [3H]oleate, or [3H]octanoate was added, and the stock solution was diluted into the final culture medium to give concentrations of 1.25% BSA, 0.2 mm (0.5 μCi/ml) fatty acid. Twenty-four hours following viral transduction, the culture medium was replaced with fresh Differentiation Medium containing labeled fatty acids (triplicate wells for each condition), and culture continued for a further 18 h. Identical incubations were conducted on parallel plates that contained no cells. The medium was then collected, and tritiated water was determined by the vapor-phase equilibration method of Hughes et al. (40Hughes S.D. Quaade C. Johnson J.H. Ferber S. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15205-15212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS and collected in 1 ml of 1 n NaOH for measurement of protein content by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). 2-[3H]Deoxyglucose Uptake—Palmitate was preconjugated with BSA as described for fatty acid oxidation experiments (above) but without isotope. A parallel solution was prepared using BSA in the absence of palmitate for addition to control cells. Twenty-four hours after viral transduction, culture medium was replaced with fresh Differentiation Medium containing 1.25% (w/v) BSA, 0.2 mm palmitate or BSA alone. After 14 h, the medium was changed to serum-free medium with the same additions, and culture continued for a further 4 h. Cells were then incubated for 20 min in fresh medium in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin. 2-[3H]Deoxyglucose ([3H]DOG) uptake was determined in triplicate wells for each condition by the method of Tremblay and Marette (41Tremblay F. Marette A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38052-38060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) over 5 min in the presence of 10 μm (0.5 μCi/ml) 2-deoxyglucose, and protein was measured as above. [14C]Glucose Incorporation into Glycogen—Virally transduced L6 or C2C12 cells were preincubated with BSA or BSA/palmitate in Differentiation Medium, as described above, for 16 h followed by 2 h in serum-free medium with the same additions and a further 60 min in fresh medium containing 2 μCi/ml d-[U-14C]glucose in the presence or absence of 100 nm insulin. Triplicate wells were used for each condition. After incubation with the isotope, the medium was removed, and the monolayers were washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS. To solubilize the cells, 500 μl/well 1 n NaOH was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. A 300-μl portion was then collected (the remainder was used to measure protein content), and 10 μl of 50 mg/ml unlabeled glycogen were added as carrier. Glycogen was precipitated by the addition of 750 μl ethanol (prechilled to -20 °C) and incubation at -20 °C for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellets were redissolved in 250 μlof1 n NaOH by heating at 60 °C for 30 min, and 200 μl were taken for liquid scintillation counting. Immunoblot Analysis of Signaling Molecules—Twenty-four hours after transduction with adenoviruses, L6 cells were incubated with or without 0.2 mm palmitate for 14 h in Differentiation Medium followed by 4 h in serum-free medium with the same additions and 20 min in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin. The medium was then removed, the cells were rapidly washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and 150 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added. After 10 min on ice, the lysis buffer was collected, and triplicate wells were pooled. Samples were sonicated (three brief pulses using a Virsonic 100 sonicator; power setting, 5) followed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were discarded, and the solubilized proteins (∼15 μg/sample) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters for immunoblotting by conventional means. After probing with phosphorylation-specific antibodies the membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against total kinase proteins and actin. Signals were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL Plus detection system, Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to x-ray film to produce bands within the linear range. Quantification was accomplished with NIH Image software. Triacylglycerol Assay—Triacylglycerol was extracted and measured by a variation of the method of Danno et al. (42Danno H. Jincho Y. Budiyanto S. Furukawa Y. Kimura S. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1992; 38: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). L6 cells transduced with AdV-β-gal or AdV-L-CPT I were incubated for 18 h in Differentiation Medium in the absence or presence of 0.2 mm palmitate. The monolayers were harvested by scraping (six wells for each condition pooled in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS), centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in 200 μlof2 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Samples were then sonicated (two pulses of 5 s each, settings as above), and 20 μl were removed for protein assay. Tertiary butanol (200 μl) was added to the remaining material followed by vortex mixing for 30 s. This was followed by the addition of 100 μl of Triton X-114:MeOH (1:1) and vortex mixing as before. The phases were separated by centrifugation at 18,000 × g at room temperature, and 250 μl of the upper phase were collected. The glycerol component of triacylglycerol was determined using a kit (GPO Trinder triacylglycerol kit, Sigma). Ceramide and Diacylglycerol Assay—Cells (preincubated plus or minus palmitate as above) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lipids were extracted using a modification of the method of Bligh and Dyer (43Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Briefly cells were scraped with 1.0 ml of methanol (three pooled wells) containing 0.2 mg/ml of β-hydroxytoluene as antioxidant. Chloroform was added (2.0 ml), and sample containers were filled with N2 gas and placed at 4 °C overnight. The samples were then centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the organic phase was collected, washed with 600 μl of 0.15 n NaCl, and dried in vacuo. The pellet was dissolved in 500 μl of 1.0 n NaOH for protein determination. Diacylglycerol and ceramide were phosphorylated using sn-1,2-diacylglycerol kinase in the presence of [32P]ATP, and the labeled products were separated by thin layer chromatography according to the method of Preiss et al.

However, the precise mechanism for specification of retinal neuronal subtypes, particularly horizontal neurons and photoreceptors, remains to be determined. Here, we examined retinas with three different combinations of triple bHLH gene mutations. In retinas lacking the bHLH genes Ngn2, Math3, and NeuroD, horizontal neurons as well as other neurons such as bipolar cells were severely decreased in number. In the retina lacking the bHLH genes Mash1, Ngn2, and Math3, horizontal and other neurons were severely decreased, whereas ganglion cells were increased. In the retina lacking the bHLH genes Mash1, Math3, and NeuroD, photoreceptors were severely decreased, whereas ganglion cells were increased. In all cases, glial cells were increased. The increase and decrease of these cells were the result of cell fate changes and cell death and seem to be partly attributable to the remaining bHLH gene expression, which also changes because of triple bHLH gene mutations. These results indicate that multiple bHLH genes cross-regulate each other, cooperatively specify neuronal subtypes, and regulate neuronal survival in the developing retina.

In the neural retina, there are six types of neurons and one type of glial cell forming three cellular layers as follows: (i) rod and cone photoreceptors in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) 1The abbreviations used are: ONL, outer nuclear layer; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; E, embryonic day; GCL, ganglion cell layer; GS, glutamine synthase; INL, inner nuclear layer; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling. ; (ii) horizontal, bipolar, and amacrine interneurons and Müller glia in the inner nuclear layer (INL); and (iii) ganglion and displaced amacrine cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). During retinal development, these seven types of cells are generated from common precursors in sequences relatively conserved among species (1Young R.W. Anat. Rec. 1985; 212: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 2Cepko C.L. Austin C.P. Yang X. Alexiades M. Ezzeddine D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar); ganglion cells are generated first, followed in overlapping phases by horizontal cells, cones, amacrine cells, rods, bipolar cells and, finally, Müller glial cells. The retina is a good model system for investigating the mechanism of neural development because it has a relatively simple structure and mimics normal development in isolated explant cultures. It has been shown that retinal cell fate determination and differentiation are controlled by intrinsic cues, such as transcription factors, and extrinsic signals, such as neurotrophic factors (3Harris W.A.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes are good candidates for intrinsic regulators of retinal cell fate decision (7Cepko C.L. Curr. Opin.

In the developing mammalian eye, neurogenic bHLH genes such as Mash1, Math3, Math5, Ngn2, and NeuroD are expressed by retinal precursor cells (10Guillemot F. Joyner A.L. Mech.

Loss of function studies indicate that these bHLH genes play an essential role in specification of many retinal cell types. For example, in the absence of Math5, ganglion cells are severely decreased, whereas amacrine cells are increased, indicating that Math5 regulates ganglion versus amacrine cell fate decision (17Wang S.W. Kim B.S. Ding K. Wang H. Sun D. Johnson R.L. Klein W.H. Gan L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 18Brown N.L. Patel S. Brzezinski J. Glaser T.

In contrast, in the absence of Math3 and NeuroD amacrine cells are severely decreased, whereas ganglion cells are increased (20Inoue T. Hojo M. Bessho Y. Tano Y. Lee J.E. Kageyama R. Development. 2002; 129: 831-842PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Math5 is up-regulated in retinas lacking both Math3 and NeuroD (20Inoue T. Hojo M. Bessho Y. Tano Y. Lee J.E. Kageyama R. Development. 2002; 129: 831-842PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that antagonistic regulation between Math5 and Math3/NeuroD regulates ganglion/amacrine cell fate choice. For specification of bipolar cells, either Mash1 or Math3 is required (21Tomita K. Moriyoshi K. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R.

It is likely that, when compensatory neurogenic bHLH gene expression does not occur, the mutant cells adopt the glial fate while becoming different subtypes of neurons when compensatory neurogenic bHLH gene expression occurs. Despite these extensive studies, the precise mechanism for retinal cell type specification remains to be determined. In particular, the bHLH genes that regulate horizontal and photoreceptor cell genesis remains to be determined. It is likely that, in single or double mutations of bHLH genes, other neurogenic bHLH genes may compensate for horizontal and photoreceptor cell development. In the present study, we analyzed the retina with three different combinations of triple compound mutations for neurogenic bHLH genes. We found that rod genesis is strongly reduced in the Mash1;Math3;NeuroD triple-mutant retina, whereas horizontal cell genesis is significantly impaired in Mash1;Ngn2;Math3 and Ngn2;Math3;NeuroD triple-mutant retina. These results indicate that retinal cell fate specification depends on the compensatory expression of multiple bHLH genes. Generation of Double and Triple Mutant Mice—Math3 (21Tomita K. Moriyoshi K.

Mash1;NeuroD, Ngn2;NeuroD and Ngn2;Math3 double-mutant mice were obtained by crossing each double heterozygous mouse. Mash1;Math3;NeuroD, Mash1;Ngn2;Math3, and Ngn2;Math3;NeuroD triple mutant mice were obtained by crossing each triple heterozygous mouse or triple-heterozygous female and (Mash1+/-;NeuroD+/-, Mash1+/-;Ngn2+/-, or Ngn2+/-;NeuroD+/-);Math3-/- male mouse. Their genetic background was mostly ICR. The mutant mice were obtained from embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5) because most of the double or triple mutant mice died around birth. Retinal explants were prepared from E17.5 embryos and cultured for 4, 8, or 14 days to examine the postnatal development of the mutant retina. Retinal Explant Culture—The retinal explant culture was performed as described previously (31Tomita K. Ishibashi M. Nakahara K. Ang S.-L. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R.

Briefly, eyes were isolated from E17.5 mouse embryos and transferred to a phosphate-buffered solution. The neural retina without pigment epithelium was placed on a Millicell chamber filter (Millipore; diameter 30 mm, pore size 0.4 mm) with the ganglion cell layer upwards. The chamber was transferred to a six-well culture plate. Each well contained 1 ml of culture medium (50% minimum Eagle's medium with Hepes, 25% Hanks' solution, 25% heat-inactivated horse serum, 200 mm l-glutamine, and 5.75 mg/ml glucose). Explants were cultured at 34 °C in 5% CO2, and the medium was changed every other day. Immunohistochemistry—The retinal explants were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in a phosphate-buffered solution for 10 min and incubated in 25% sucrose in a phosphate-buffered solution for 30 min on ice, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound, and sectioned (16-μm thickness). For immunohistochemistry, the samples were preincubated with a blocking solution (5% normal goat serum with or without 0.1% Triton X-100 in a phosphate-buffered solution) for 1 h and then incubated overnight or for 2 days at 4 °C in 1% goat serum with or without 0.1% Triton X-100 with the following antibodies: mouse anti-RETP1/rhodopsin (Sigma); mouse anti-protein kinase C (Amersham Biosciences); mouse anti-HPC1/syntaxin (Sigma); rabbit anti-recoverin (kind gift of J.

Among them, Math5 induces ganglion cell fate specification, whereas the other bHLH genes regulate other cell types. To determine which genes regulate horizontal and photoreceptor cell fate specification, we focused on the neurogenic bHLH genes Mash1, Ngn2, Math3, and NeuroD. We first examined the regulatory interaction of bHLH genes in retinal development. In the absence of either Ngn2 or Math3, Mash1 expression is up-regulated in the retina (Fig. 1, A–C). Similarly, in the absence of either Mash1 or Math3, Ngn2 expression is up-regulated (Fig. 1, D–F). Math3 expression is also weakly up-regulated in Mash1-/- or Ngn2-/- retina (Fig. 1, G–I). These results indicate that Mash1, Ngn2, and Math3 antagonistically cross-regulate expression in the retina. It is likely that, in the absence of one or two bHLH genes, the remaining genes may be up-regulated and compensate for the deficiency. In the absence of NeuroD, however, expression of other bHLH genes is not changed (data not shown). NeuroD expression is slightly up-regulated in the absence of Ngn2 but not in the absence of Math3 (Fig. 1, J–L). To identify the bHLH genes that regulate horizontal and photoreceptor cell development, we examined the retina with double mutations of Mash1-/-;Ngn2-/-, Mash1-/-; Math3-/-, Mash1-/-;NeuroD-/-, Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-, Ngn2-/-;NeuroD-/-, and Math3-/-;NeuroD-/-. These mutations have a normal number of horizontal cells (20–22, data not shown). Although some of them have a reduced number of photoreceptors, none of them has fewer photoreceptors than does the NeuroD-/- retina (16, data not shown). Thus, it is likely that, in the double mutations, the other genes may compensate horizontal and photoreceptor cell development. We therefore examined three sets of triple mutations, Ngn2-/-; Math3-/-;NeuroD-/-, Mash1-/-;Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-, and Mash1-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/-, to identify the bHLH genes that regulate horizontal and photoreceptor cell development. Because these triple mutant mice die around birth, we prepared retinal explants from E17.5 embryos and performed a two-week culture to examine the postnatal development of the mutant retina. Defects of Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- Retina—We first examined the defects of the Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina. This triple mutant retina consisted of two cellular layers (Fig. 2, G–L), unlike the three cellular layers of the wild type retina (Fig. 2, A–F). The majority of the outer layer cells were found to be rod photoreceptors (rhodopsin+recoverin+) (Fig. 2, G and H). The inner boundary of the photoreceptor layer was irregular, indicating that the arrangement of photoreceptors was disorganized in this mutant retina (Fig. 2, G and H, arrowheads). This layer also contained a small number of amacrine cells (calbindin+) (Fig. 2I). However, there were virtually no horizontal (calbindin+) and bipolar cells (protein kinase C+Islet-1+) (Fig. 2, I–K). Horizontal and bipolar cells form a synapse with photoreceptors in the outer plexiform layer that separates the ONL and the INL. Thus, it is likely that the lack of horizontal and bipolar cells leads to the fusion of the INL and ONL in this triple mutant retina. The GCL contains ganglion cells (p75+Islet-1+), but their number was also significantly reduced (Fig. 2, K and L). In contrast, Müller glial cells (GS+cyclinD3+) were increased in number (Fig. 3, C and D) as compared with the wild type (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, the cell bodies of Müller glia, which are normally located in the INL (Fig. 3, A and B), were scattered throughout the outer layer (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating that the migration of Müller glial cell bodies is impaired.Fig. 3Increase of gliogenesis in the retina with triple mutations for neurogenic bHLH genes. Retinal explants were prepared from wild type (A and B), Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- (C and D), Mash1-/-;Ngn2-/-;Math3-/- (E and F), and Mash1-/-;Math3-/-; NeuroD-/- (G and H) embryos at E17.5 and cultured for 2 weeks. Müller glial cells were examined by immunohistochemistry (green) for GS (A, C, E, and G) and cyclin D3 (B, D, F, and H). In all triple mutants, Müller glial cells are increased in number (C–H) as compared with the wild type (WT; A and B). Interestingly, in the Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina, the positions of nuclei of Müller glia are disorganized (D). Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (red). Scale bar, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Quantification of the cell numbers showed that only Müller glial cells were increased, whereas the other cell types, including photoreceptors, were decreased in number in the Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina (Fig. 4). In particular, bipolar and horizontal cells were virtually missing, indicating that Ngn2, Math3, and NeuroD are essential for bipolar and horizontal cell genesis. Because these cells are generated in the double mutations of Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-, Ngn2-/-; NeuroD-/- and Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- (20, data not shown), these three bHLH genes compensate each other for bipolar and horizontal cell development. Defects of Mash1-/-;Ngn2-/-;Math3-/- Retina—We next examined the defects of the Mash1-/-;Ngn2-/-; Math3-/- retina. Like the wild type retina, this triple mutant retina consisted of three cellular layers (Fig. 2, M–R). The ONL contained a normal number of photoreceptors (rhodopsin+recoverin+; Fig. 2, M and N, and Fig. 4). However, the INL contained fewer amacrine and horizontal cells (calbindin+, Figs. 2O and 4) and even fewer bipolar cells (recoverin+protein kinase C+Islet1+, Fig. 2, N, P, and Q, and Fig. 4). Instead, there were more Müller glial cells in the mutant INL (GS+cyclinD3+; Fig. 3, E and F, and Fig. 4). In addition, ganglion cells were significantly increased in the GCL (p75+Islet-1+, Fig. 2, Q and R, and Fig. 4). These results indicate that Mash1, Ngn2, and Math3 are essential for generation of the correct numbers of the INL neurons and for suppression of the overproduction of ganglion cells. Defects of Mash1-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- Retina—We next examined the defects of the Mash1-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina. This mutant retina also consisted of three cellular layers (Fig. 2, S–X). However, the number of photoreceptors in the ONL was significantly reduced as compared with the wild type (rhodopsin+recoverin+, Fig. 2, S and T, and Fig. 4). The number of photoreceptors in this triple mutant retina was about one-third of the wild type (Fig. 4), indicating that Mash1, Math3, and NeuroD play an important role in the generation of photoreceptors. In addition, there were very few bipolar cells in the INL (recoverin+protein kinase C+Islet1+; Fig. 2, T, V, and W, and Fig. 4), as observed in the Mash1-/-; Math3-/- double-mutant retina (21Tomita K. Moriyoshi K. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5460-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 22Hatakeyama J. Tomita K. Inoue T. Kageyama R. Development. 2001; 128: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, there were almost normal numbers of amacrine and horizontal cells in the INL (calbindin+, Figs. 2U and 4), raising the possibility that the Mash1 mutation, in addition to the Math3 and NeuroD double mutations, may revive amacrine cells, because these cells are mostly missing in Math3 and NeuroD double mutations (20Inoue T. Hojo M. Bessho Y. Tano Y. Lee J.E. Kageyama R. Development. 2002; 129: 831-842PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, there were more ganglion cells in the GCL (p75+Islet-1+; Figs. 2, W and X, and Fig. 4) and more Müller glial cells in the INL (GS+cyclinD3+; Fig. 3, G and H, and Fig. 4). Taken together, in the retina with triple mutations of neurogenic bHLH genes, many subtypes of neurons were missing or decreased whereas Müller glial cells were increased, a finding that is consistent with the idea that neurogenic bHLH genes promote neuronal versus glial formation. However, in some cases ganglion cells were increased, suggesting that the remaining neurogenic bHLH gene expression is important for the compensated neuronal subtypes. Increased Cell Death and Fate Switch in the Triple Mutant Retina—The decrease or the absence of subsets of neurons and the concomitant increase of Müller glia could be involved in either neuronal death and glial proliferation or the cell fate switch from neurons to glia. To differentiate between these possibilities, we next examined cell proliferation and death of the retina at several time points, namely days 4, 8, and 14 of the explant cultures. Cell proliferation was analyzed by the immunostaining of Ki67, an antigen expressed in all phases of cell cycles (36Kill I. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1253-1263PubMed Google Scholar). During the time course examined, cell proliferation was not altered in the mutant retina (data not shown), suggesting that cell proliferation is not involved in increase of glial cells. Cell death was next analyzed by TUNEL. In the wild type retina, subsets of cells underwent apoptosis at day 4 (Fig. 5A), but their number was decreased at later time points (Fig. 5, B and C). In Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina, cell death was not significantly increased at day 4 of culture (Fig. 5D). However, at later stages, TUNEL+ cells were increased in the photoreceptor layer (Fig. 5, E and F). Because photoreceptors were significantly decreased in this triple mutant retina, it is likely that this decrease is due to cell death. Cell death was not observed in the region that contained ganglion and amacrine cells (Fig. 5, E and F). In addition, cell death was not increased at day 4 (Fig. 5D), by which time the fate of most cell types is determined. Thus, the decrease or absence of ganglion and the INL-specific neurons is not due to cell death but is likely the result of the fate switch from ganglion and INL neurons to Müller glial cells in the absence of the neurogenic bHLH genes Ngn2, Math3, and NeuroD. In contrast, cell death was not increased in the Mash1-/-;Ngn2-/-;Math3-/- retina (Fig. 5G), suggesting that the decrease or lack of amacrine, bipolar, and horizontal cells and the increase of ganglion and Müller glial cells are due to fate switches of retinal precursors. In the Mash1-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina, cell death was increased slightly in the ONL (Fig. 5H) as compared with the wild type (Fig. 5C). However, the cell death was almost the same level as that of the NeuroD-/- retina (Fig. 5I) where photoreceptors underwent apoptosis (16Morrow E.M. Furukawa T. Lee J.E. Cepko C.L. Development. 1999; 126: 23-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because in this triple mutant retina there were fewer photoreceptors than in the NeuroD-/- retina, the reduction of photoreceptors in the triple mutations cannot be explained solely by cell death. It is likely that the fate switch from photoreceptors to ganglion and Müller glial cells may occur in the absence of Mash1, Math3, and NeuroD. Expression of the Remaining bHLH Genes in the Triple Mutant Retina—The expression of the remaining bHLH genes in the triple mutant retina was next examined by in situ hybridization. Mash1 expression was up-regulated in the Math3-/- retina (Fig. 6B), the double mutations Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- and Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-, and the triple mutation Ngn2-/-; Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- (Fig. 6, C–E). Ngn2 expression was also up-regulated in the Math3-/-, Mash1-/-;Math3-/-, Math3-/-;NeuroD-/-, and the Mash1-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retinas (Fig. 6, G–J). In contrast, NeuroD expression was not significantly changed in the Math3-/-, Ngn2-/-; Math3-/-, Mash1-/-;Math3-/-, and Mash1-/-;Ngn2-/-; Math3-/- retinas (Fig. 6, L–O). Math5 expression was not changed in the Math3-/- retina (Fig. 6Q), which has a normal number of ganglion cells (21Tomita K. Moriyoshi K. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5460-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In contrast, Math5 expression was greatly up-regulated in the Mash1-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- and Mash1-/-;Ngn2-/-; Math3-/- retinas (Fig. 6, R and S), a finding that is consistent with the observation that ganglion cells are increased in these triple mutants (Fig. 4). Strikingly, Math5 expression was significantly down-regulated in the Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina at both E14 and E17.5 (Fig. 6, T and V; compare with Fig. 6, P and U, respectively), which is consistent with the observation that ganglion cells are decreased in this triple mutant retina (Fig. 4). These results indicate that Math5 expression is regulated differently by the other bHLH genes. Specification of Retinal Neuronal Subtypes by Multiple Neurogenic bHLH Genes—Previous studies demonstrated that the generation of retinal neurons is controlled by multiple neurogenic bHLH genes (7Cepko C.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 8Vetter M.L. Brown N.L. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Hatakeyama J. Kageyama R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, the bHLH genes that regulate the formation of horizontal and photoreceptor cells remain to be determined. Here, we found that in the triple mutations Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- and Mash1-/-; Ngn2-/-;Math3-/- the generation of horizontal cells as well as other neurons is severely impaired (summarized in Fig. 7). Furthermore, photoreceptor cell genesis is also reduced in the triple mutant Mash1-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- (Fig. 7). However, in any of the single and double mutations that we tested, horizontal and photoreceptor cell genesis is not affected so significantly. These results indicate that more than two bHLH genes cooperatively regulate horizontal and photoreceptor cell development. Horizontal cell genesis is affected only in Ngn2-/-; Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- and Mash1-/-;Ngn2-/-;Math3-/- retinas but not in the Mash1-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina, suggesting that Ngn2 may be most important for horizontal cells (Fig. 7). However, horizontal cell development normally occurs in the double mutations Mash1-/-;Ngn2-/-, Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-, and Ngn2-/-;NeuroD-/-, indicating that Ngn2 is not essential for horizontal cell genesis. Thus, all four bHLH genes, Mash1, Ngn2, Math3, and NeuroD, are involved in horizontal cell development. It was shown previously that retinal neuronal subtypes are specified by combinations of bHLH and homeodomain genes (20Inoue T. Hojo M. Bessho Y. Tano Y. Lee J.E. Kageyama R. Development. 2002; 129: 831-842PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hatakeyama J. Tomita K. Inoue T. Kageyama R. Development. 2001; 128: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, bHLH genes alone are not sufficient for bipolar cell development, but combinations of the bHLH genes Mash1/Math3 and the homeodomain gene Chx10 are required for bipolar cell formation (22Hatakeyama J. Tomita K. Inoue T. Kageyama R. Development. 2001; 128: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chx10 determines the layer identity (the INL), whereas Mash1/Math3 specifies the INL-specific neuronal subtype. Similarly, the homeodomain gene Prox1 was shown to be essential for horizontal cell development (37Dyer M.A. Livesey F.J. Cepko C.L. Oliver G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that combinations of Mash1/Ngn2/Math3/NeuroD and Prox1 are required for horizontal cell genesis. Our results also demonstrated that the three bHLH genes Mash1, Math3, and NeuroD are important for photoreceptor cell formation. In the absence of these bHLH genes, many photoreceptors underwent apoptosis. However, the number of dying cells in the Mash1-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina is almost the same as that of the NeuroD-/- retina, suggesting that NeuroD is most important for the survival of photoreceptors. Importantly, there were even fewer photoreceptors in the Mash1-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina than in the NeuroD-/- retina, indicating that cell death alone cannot explain the reduction of photoreceptors. It is likely that the cells that should normally differentiate into photoreceptors adopted other cell types in the triple mutations. These results indicate that Mash1, Math3, and NeuroD cooperatively regulate photoreceptor specification. It was shown that the homeodomain genes Crx and Otx2 are essential for photoreceptor development (38Furukawa T. Morrow E.M. Cepko C.L.

Cross-regulation of Neurogenic bHLH Genes—We showed that the three bHLH genes Mash1, Ngn2, and Math3 mutually regulate their expression in the retina. In the absence of one of the bHLH genes, expression of the other two is up-regulated, indicating that these bHLH genes antagonistically regulate their expression. In contrast, the expression of these bHLH genes is not significantly affected by NeuroD deficiency, and NeuroD expression is not significantly affected by mutations of other bHLH genes, suggesting that NeuroD expression could be regulated independently of most other bHLH genes in the retina. Math5 expression is also controlled by other bHLH genes. Interestingly, Math5 expression is up-regulated in Mash1-/-; Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- and Mash1-/-;Ngn2-/-;Math3-/- retinas but down-regulated in the Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina (Fig. 7). The up-regulation and down-regulation of Math5 expression observed in the triple mutant retina correlated well with the increase and decrease of ganglion cell genesis (Fig. 7), a finding that is consistent with the previous report that Math5 is essential for ganglion cell development (17Wang S.W. Kim B.S. Ding K. Wang H. Sun D. Johnson R.L. Klein W.H. Gan L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 18Brown N.L. Patel S. Brzezinski J. Glaser T. Development. 2001; 128: 2497-2508PubMed Google Scholar). In Mash1-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- and Mash1-/-; Ngn2-/-;Math3-/- retinas, Ngn2 and NeuroD, respectively, are expressed, suggesting that Ngn2 and NeuroD do not repress Math5 expression. In contrast, in the Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina, Mash1 expression is up-regulated, and Math5 expression is down-regulated, suggesting that Mash1 may repress Math5 expression (Fig. 7). Further studies will be required to determine whether Mash1 directly represses Math5 transcription by binding to its promoter. The Difference in Remaining bHLH Gene Expression May Be Responsible for the Difference in Neuronal Subtypes Compensated in Triple Mutations—In the Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina, the number of amacrine cells is severely reduced. These triple mutations increase the expression of Mash1 (Fig. 7), which is inhibitory to amacrine cell genesis (20Inoue T. Hojo M. Bessho Y. Tano Y. Lee J.E. Kageyama R. Development. 2002; 129: 831-842PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a normal number of amacrine cells are generated in the Mash1-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina. These triple mutations increase Ngn2 expression, which could promote amacrine cell development (Fig. 7). We previously found that two bHLH genes Math3 and NeuroD are essential for amacrine cell genesis (20Inoue T. Hojo M. Bessho Y. Tano Y. Lee J.E. Kageyama R. Development. 2002; 129: 831-842PubMed Google Scholar). However, because a normal number of amacrine cells are generated in the Mash1-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina, the loss of amacrine cells in the retina lacking Math3 and NeuroD (but not Mash1) is not simply the result of mutations of the amacrine cell genesis-promoting bHLH genes. It is likely that up-regulation of the inhibitory bHLH gene Mash1 is also important for the loss of amacrine cells in the retina lacking Math3 and NeuroD. These results suggest that the remaining bHLH gene expression may be responsible for determining which cell types are compensated. In the retina lacking the three bHLH genes Ngn2, Math3, and NeuroD, a reduced number of amacrine cells were generated, although we found previously that, in the retina lacking two bHLH genes, Math3 and NeuroD, amacrine cells are mostly missing (20Inoue T. Hojo M. Bessho Y. Tano Y. Lee J.E. Kageyama R. Development. 2002; 129: 831-842PubMed Google Scholar). We do not have definitive evidence to explain why amacrine cells were slightly increased in the triple mutations as compared with the double mutations, because Mash1 expression was up-regulated in both retina (Fig. 6, C–E). It was reported previously that NeuroD-mutant phenotypes depend upon the genetic backgrounds; NeuroD-null mice on a 129/SvEv genetic background die of severe diabetes shortly after birth, whereas those on different backgrounds survive to adulthood (44Liu M. Pleasure S.J. Collins A.E. Noebels J.L. Naya F.J. Tsai M.-J. Lowenstein D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Thus, the difference in amacrine cell genesis between Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- and Ngn2-/-; Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retinas could be due to different genetic backgrounds, because ICR mice of Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- and of Ngn2-/- derive from different colonies. It is interesting that bipolar cells are mostly missing in all of the triple mutations that we examined (Fig. 7). We found previously that either Mash1 or Math3 can induce generation of bipolar cells with the homeodomain gene Chx10, whereas in the absence of both Mash1 and Math3 all bipolar cells are missing (21Tomita K. Moriyoshi K. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5460-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 22Hatakeyama J. Tomita K. Inoue T. Kageyama R. Development. 2001; 128: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable that there are virtually no bipolar cells in the Mash1-/-;Ngn2-/-;Math3-/- and Mash1-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retinas. However, it remains to be determined why bipolar cells are missing in the Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina, because Mash1 is still expressed. Because cell death is increased in the Ngn2-/-;Math3-/-;NeuroD-/- retina, it is possible that bipolar cells may die during development. In conclusion, our data indicate that multiple neurogenic bHLH genes cross-regulate each other, cooperatively specify retinal neuronal subtypes, and regulate the survival of retinal neurons.

VRK1 colocalizes with ATF2 in the nucleus and can form a stable complex. We have studied the phosphorylation of the transcription factor ATF2, which regulates gene expression by forming dimers with proteins with basic region-leucine zipper domains and recognizing cAMP-response element or AP1 sequences implicated in cellular responses to stress. VRK1 phosphorylates ATF2 mainly on Thr-73, stabilizing the ATF2 protein and increasing its intracellular level. Mutagenesis studies showed that Thr-73 and Ser-62 are implicated in ATF2 transcriptional activation by VRK1 detected in a functional assay based on ATF2 dimerization. VRK1 can activate the collagenase gene promoter that is regulated by ATF2 in a dose-dependent manner. Loss of kinase activity (K179E mutant) or the T73A substitution in ATF2 prevents both its accumulation and activation of transcription. VRK1 and JNK, which phosphorylates ATF2 in Thr-69 and Thr-71, have an additive effect on ATF2-dependent transcription at suboptimal doses. Therefore, two groups of amino acids in the ATF2 amino-terminal region can integrate different cellular signals mediated by at least five different kinases.

Some of these transcription factors belong to the activating transcription factor (ATF) 1The abbreviations used are: ATF, activating transcription factor; b-ZIP, basic region-leucine zipper; CRE, cAMP-response element; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; VRK, vaccinia-related kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; Cy, cyanine; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; Luc, luciferase; GAL, galactose.1The abbreviations used are: ATF, activating transcription factor; b-ZIP, basic region-leucine zipper; CRE, cAMP-response element; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; VRK, vaccinia-related kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; Cy, cyanine; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; Luc, luciferase; GAL, galactose./cAMP-response element-binding (CREB) protein family of basic region-leucine zipper (b-ZIP) proteins (2Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), which are involved in the response to stress, such as viral infections (3van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these proteins are regulated by phosphorylation in their amino-terminal region (5Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar).The ATF protein family is composed of several subgroups based on their amino acid similarity and includes CREB, ATF2/CRE-BP1, ATF3, ATF4, ATF6, and B-ATF (6Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). These proteins have two domains. One is a leucine zipper (7Maekawa T. Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sudo T. Yoshimura T. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. Ishii S. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) that permits their dimerization either with themselves or with members of other protein families that also contain b-ZIP sequences, thus forming either homo- or heterodimers (2Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 6Hai T. Hartman M.G.

Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The homo- or heterodimeric compositions confer a large flexibility to these factors by modulation of their DNA binding specificity (8van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2453-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and thus increase their regulatory potential. These proteins have a DNA binding domain that recognizes a core sequence located in the promoters of some viral genes, such as adenovirus E1A (9Hagmeyer B.M. Angel P. van Dam H. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This core DNA sequence also mediates the cell response to fluctuations in the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (5Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) and in intracellular free calcium (10Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhao X. Means A.R. McKnight G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6107-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The CRE (cAMP-response element) proteins recognize a specific core sequence on a variety of gene promoters that are likely to be context-dependent (5Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The specificity of ATF2 can also be affected by interactions with viral proteins such as hepatitis B X protein (14Maguire H.F. Hoeffler J.P. Siddiqui A.

ATF2 also contributes to the regulation of genes implicated in cell growth, differentiation, immune response, and response to stress. Some of these genes are c-jun (16Duyndam M.C. van Dam H. Smits P.H. Verlaan M. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2311-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), collagenase (17Steinmuller L. Cibelli G. Moll J.R. Vinson C. Thiel G.

JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylate ATF2 at Thr-69 and Thr-71, stimulating its transactivation potential (27Clerk A. Harrison J.G. Long C.S. Sugden P.H. J. Mol. Cell.

Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at these residues also stabilizes ATF2 (23Fuchs S.Y. Tappin I. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12560-12564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and modulates its acetyltransferase activity (30Kawasaki H. Schiltz L. Chiu R. Itakura K. Taira K. Nakatani Y. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 2000; 405: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). More recently a novel phosphorylation of ATF2 has been detected at Thr-73, in combination with Thr-69 and Thr-71 (13Ban N. Yamada Y. Someya Y. Ihara Y. Adachi T. Kubota A. Watanabe R. Kuroe A. Inada A. Miyawaki K. Sunaga Y. Shen Z.P. Iwakura T. Tsukiyama K. Toyokuni S. Tsuda K. Seino Y. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1142-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is mediated by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaM kinase IV), which is required for the ATF2-dependent positive regulation of the human insulin gene (13Ban N. Yamada Y. Someya Y. Ihara Y. Adachi T. Kubota A. Watanabe R. Kuroe A. Inada A. Miyawaki K. Sunaga Y. Shen Z.P. Iwakura T. Tsukiyama K. Toyokuni S. Tsuda K. Seino Y. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1142-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Also protein kinase A phosphorylates ATF2 at Ser-62 in response to cAMP (31Sakurai A. Maekawa T. Sudo T. Ishii S. Kishimoto A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).In the human kinome, the VRK gene family represents a novel branch from the lineage that led to the group of casein kinases (32Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6126) Google Scholar). The human VRK proteins were originally identified by their homology with the B1R kinase of vaccinia virus, an early protein required for viral DNA synthesis and replication (33Lin S. Chen W. Broyles S.S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2717-2723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Banham A.H. Smith G.L. Virology. 1992; 191: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Rempel R.E. Traktman P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4413-4426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ortholog genes in yeast, Hrr25 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Hhp1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, have been implicated in responses to DNA damage (36Dhillon N. Hoekstra M.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2777-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, such a role has not yet been identified for the human VRK proteins. The VRK kinase family is composed of three proteins, of which only VRK1 and VRK2 have been shown to be active, despite the relatively weak conservation of its kinase domain (37Lopez-Borges S. Lazo P.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3656-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 38Barcia R. Lopez-Borges S. Vega F.M. Lazo P.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The three VRK proteins differ in their putative regulatory domain, which is located in the carboxyl terminus for VRK1 and -2 and in the amino terminus for VRK3 (39Nichols R.J. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7934-7946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). VRK1 is highly expressed in proliferating tissues, such as tumor cell lines (40Nezu J. Oku A. Jones M.H. Shimane M. Genomics. 1997; 45: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and during the hematopoietic proliferative phase in murine embryo midgestation (41Vega F.M. Gonzalo P. Gaspar M.L. Lazo P.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). VRK1 is a novel nuclear kinase, detected in both murine and human cells, that regulates p53 by phosphorylation on Thr-18 (37Lopez-Borges S. Lazo P.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3656-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 38Barcia R. Lopez-Borges S. Vega F.M. Lazo P.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a residue essential for the interaction between p53 and hdm2 (42Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbass B. Moreau J. Levine A.J.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7100-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This effect of VRK1 suggests that it might play a role in mechanisms controlling cellular responses to stress and DNA damage. Because of the relationship of p53 to stress we decided to determine whether this kinase is also able to phosphorylate other substrates that are known to be phosphorylated in response to stress signals.In this work we report the phosphorylation of the transcription factor ATF2 by a new kinase, VRK1. This phosphorylation takes place in novel residues within the amino terminus of ATF2 and results in its stabilization and increased transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the ATF2 phosphorylation by VRK1 can cooperate with the phosphorylation mediated by JNK.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Fusion Proteins—Bacterial expression construct pGEX-ATF2 (1–109) was a gift from R. Green (University of Massachusetts) (45Li X.Y. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and GST-VRK1 fusion protein was described previously (37Lopez-Borges S. Lazo P.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3656-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression plasmid pHA-ATF2 with full-length cDNA was a gift from K. Yokoyama (Tsukuba, Japan) (30Kawasaki H. Schiltz L. Chiu R. Itakura K. Taira K. Nakatani Y. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 2000; 405: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid used in all of the transient transfection assays, 5× GAL4-Luc reporter, and HA-JNK1 constructions were a gift from S. Gutkind, and pSG-424-ATF2 (1–109) was provided by R. Green. For reporter activity assays, ATF2 was used in constructs fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain in plasmid pSG-424-ATF2. In this plasmid specific point mutations were introduced, and as reporter a synthetic construct was used, p5×GAL4-Luc. The -517/+63 collagenase promoter cloned in pGL3-basic vector to form pColl-luciferase was a gift of G. Thiel (University of Saarland, Germany) (17Steinmuller L. Cibelli G. Moll J.R. Vinson C. Thiel G. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As a control for luciferase the plasmid phRL-tk (Promega, Madison, WI) was used. VRK1 full-length cDNA was subcloned into pCEFL vector or pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) to generate pCEFL-HA-VRK1 and pCDNA-VRK1-Myc.Kinase Activity Assay—Aliquots of the affinity-purified GST-VRK1 fusion protein were resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm KCl, and 5 μm ATP) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 10 μg of the specific affinity-purified GST fusion protein used as substrate.Acid Hydrolysis and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Briefly, the phosphorylated GST-ATF2 protein was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to an Immobilon-P filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The radioactive band was cut, and the protein was eluted. The eluted protein was hydrolyzed with 200 μl of 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 2 h. The sample was freeze-dried and resuspended in a mixture containing 2 μl of a stock solution at 1 mg/ml Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P) as reference markers, 1 μl of 1% bromphenol blue, and 2 μl of formic acid/acetic acid/water (1:3.1:35) mix at pH 1.9. The mixture was applied to a cellulose chromatoplaque (Merck) and subjected to flat bed electrophoresis in a Multiphor II system (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (37Lopez-Borges S. Lazo P.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3656-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The radioactivity on the plate was analyzed with a FX personal imager (Bio-Rad) or exposed to x-ray film.Tryptic Phosphopeptide Mapping—γ-32P-Labeled ATF2 mutant proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Each ATF2 mutant band was excised and incubated with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone in 100 mm acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by extensive washes with water and fresh 50 mm NH4HCO3. The membrane was incubated twice with 10 μg of trypsin (Roche Diagnostics) in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, for 2 h at 37 °C and a third time for 18 h. The membrane was extensively washed with sterile distilled water. The washes were freeze-dried and oxidized with 9:1 performic acid/hydrogen peroxide for 1 h at room temperature, followed by freeze-drying. The sample was resuspended in 5 μl of formic acid/acetic acid/water (1:3.12:35.88), pH 1.9, and applied to a chromatoplaque (Merck). The first dimension was an electrophoresis at 1.5 kV for 90 min in a Multiphor system (Amersham Biosciences). The chromatoplaque was left to air dry and turned 90° for the second dimension. The second dimension was a chromatography performed in acetic acid/pyridine/n-butanol/water (1:3.33:5:4) for 13 h. The plaque was left to dry, and radioactivity was detected using an x-ray film.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations were generated using complementary oligonucleotides with the mutation desired and the aid of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The amino acid changes made in GST-ATF2 fusion protein were as follows: S9A, S20I, S28A, T37A, T52A, S62I, T69A, T71A, T73A, and S90I. Also double mutants (T69A/T71A, T69A/T73A, and T71A/T73A) as well as the triple mutant T69A/T71A/T73A were made. Some of the mutations, S62I, T71A, and T73A were also introduced in the construct pSG-424-ATF2 to be used in transcription assays. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Cell Lines and Transfections—293T human embryonic kidney and HeLa human cervical adenocarcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method or with JetPEI reagent (Polytransfection, Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The total amount of DNA within the experiments was kept constant by adding the respective empty vector plasmid DNA to the transfection mixtures.Immune Complex Kinase Assays and Western Blots—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested with a rubber policeman, and centrifuged at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 4 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated on ice for 30 min, and precleared by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody (Covance, Berkeley, CA) or with an anti-VRK1 rabbit polyclonal antibody made against the GST-VRK1 fusion protein. Immune complexes were recovered with γ-Bind G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were sequentially washed five times with lysis buffer, once with 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, and once with kinase buffer. The phosphorylation reaction was performed as described previously (37Lopez-Borges S. Lazo P.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3656-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were collected 48 h posttransfection in lysis buffer, and 25–50 μg were analyzed for the expression of VRK1- and ATF2-respective HA-tagged proteins with anti-HA antibody. The anti-HA and anti-AU5 monoclonal antibodies (IgG1 isotype) were from Covance. Western blots were performed and developed by chemiluminescence techniques using the ECL detection system and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences).Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells were grown on uncoated glass coverslips introduced into 100-mm plates (150,000 cells/plate). 30 h posttransfection using JetPEI (Polytransfection), cells were rinsed twice in PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized by incubation with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and then treated with 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 15 min. Nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 5 min and incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After that, cells were incubated with a secondary antibody, either anti-mouse secondary antibody coupled to Cy2 (Sigma) (1:200 dilution) or anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled to Cy3 (Sigma) (1:200 dilution). Fluorescence images were captured with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Fluorochromes were excited using an 18Ar laser (488-nm excitation wavelength) for Cy2 and a 2He/10Ne laser (543-nm excitation wavelength) for Cy3.Transcriptional Assays—Reporter gene assays were performed with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) at 36–48 h after transfection. The assay is based on the use of pSG-424-ATF2 (1–109) constructs with a GAL4 DNA binding domain, or its mutants and a p5×GAL4-Luc reporter were cotransfected in each sample in combination with phRL-tk Renilla luciferase as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA within the experiments was kept constant by adding the respective empty vector plasmid DNA to the transfection mixtures. The activity of the reporter luciferase was expressed relative to the activity in control vector-transfected cells. Similar results were obtained in at least three different experiments. All results were analyzed by comparing with the control (unpaired Student's t test), and shown in the figures is the mean ± S.D. of independent triplicate cultures as well as the p value.RESULTSATF2 and VRK1 Colocalize in the Nucleus—The phosphorylation by the human VRK1 protein of p53 (37Lopez-Borges S. Lazo P.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3656-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) suggested that it might also phosphorylate other transcription factors that participate in the cellular response to stress mediated by other kinases, such as JNK and p38. To determine whether there was a colocalization of the transcription factor ATF2 and the VRK1 protein, HeLa cells were transfected with pHA-ATF2 and pVRK1-Myc, and their subcellular location was determined with an antibody specific for the HA epitope. The transfected ATF2 is located in the nucleus of transfected cells and shares the same compartment as the VRK1 protein (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the cells that have taken up both plasmids appear to have a higher level of the ATF2 protein that was detected as a more intense green fluorescence signal.Smaller fractions of the two proteins overlap as nuclear signals, detected as yellow, indicating that in the nucleus VRK1 and ATF2 have proximal locations. To show that in the nucleus some of the VRK1 and ATF2 molecules colocalize, an immunoprecipitation and immunoblot study was performed. HeLa cells were cotransfected with pHA-ATF2 and pVRK1-Myc plasmids. Extracts from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody (detects HA-ATF2) followed by an immunoblot analysis against either HA-ATF2 or VRK1. The result is shown in Fig. 1B. In the ATF2 immunoprecipitate the VRK1 protein is clearly detected (Fig. 1B, right panel) suggesting that at least a proportion of the molecules does form a complex in the nucleus. The signal for ATF2 is weaker (Fig. 1B, left panel) because in the immunoblot the same antibody was used for immunoprecipitation and blotting; thus the secondary antibody used in the detection system also recognizes the immunoglobulin chains present in the immunoprecipitate and thus competes with the specific signal. Therefore, to rule out the potential contribution of nonspecific binding to the antibody used in the immunoprecipitation, a control experiment was performed in which extracts from cells transfected with VRK1 and ATF2 constructs were also immunoprecipitated with another monoclonal antibody of the same isotype (IgG1) against the AU5 epitope that is not present in these cells. In this case VRK1 is detected only when ATF2 was immunoprecipitated but not in the control with the nonspecific antibody (Fig. 1C).Phosphorylation of ATF2 by VRK1—To determine whether VRK1 was able to phosphorylate the human ATF2 protein, an in vitro kinase assay was performed. The cloned human VRK1 fused to GST was expressed as a GST-VRK1 fusion protein (37Lopez-Borges S. Lazo P.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3656-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and tested for the phosphorylation of ATF2 in vitro using as substrate a GST-ATF2 fusion protein containing residues 1–109 (Fig. 2A). The phosphorylation takes place within the ATF2 amino-terminal region and not in the GST moiety, as shown by the incorporation of the radioactivity in the ATF2 moiety. In this gel the high autophosphorylation of the VRK1 protein is noticeable (37Lopez-Borges S. Lazo P.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3656-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To confirm the ATF2 phosphorylation, the endogenous VRK1 protein from 293T cells was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody specific for human VRK1 (Fig. 2B, left lane). Alternatively, 293T cells were transfected with a construct expressing HA-VRK1, and the exogenous VRK1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2B, right lane). A kinase assay was performed with both types of immunoprecipitate, and the two kinases, endogenous or transfected, phosphorylated ATF2 (Fig. 2B). From these experiments it was concluded that the endogenous human VRK1 also can phosphorylate ATF2 in its amino-terminal region.Fig. 2Identification of several ATF2 residues in the amino terminus phosphorylated by VRK1.A, phosphorylation of GST-ATF2 by GST-VRK1 in vitro. In the left panel is shown the Coomassie Blue staining of the gel, and in the right panel is shown the incorporation of radioactivity in both GST-ATF2 and GST-VRK1 by autophosphorylation. B, phosphorylation of GST-ATF2 by the endogenous human VRK1 from 293T cells immunoprecipitated (IP) with a polyclonal antibody specific for VRK1 (left lane) or transfected with pCEFL-HA-VRK1 and immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (right lane). The kinase activity was determined in the immunoprecipitate using GST-ATF2 as substrate. At the bottom is shown the detection of the immunoprecipitated exogenous (HA-VRK1) protein with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. WB, Western blo"
https://openalex.org/W2017231336,"One of the main transitions in evolution is the shift from solitary organisms to societies with reproductive division of labour1,2. Understanding social evolution requires us to determine how ecological, social and genetic factors jointly influence group stability and partitioning of reproduction between group members3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we test the role of the three key factors predicted to influence social evolution by experimentally manipulating them in a social allodapine bee. We show that increased relatedness between nestmates results in more even reproduction among group members and a greater productivity per individual. By contrast, the degree of reproductive skew is not influenced by the opportunity for solitary breeding or by the potential benefits of cooperation. Relatedness also has a positive effect on group stability and overall productivity. These findings are in line with predictions of the tug-of-war models, in which the degree of reproductive division of labour is determined primarily by selfish competition between group members. The alternative view, where the degree of reproductive skew is the outcome of a social contract between potential breeders, was not supported by the data."
https://openalex.org/W2059184131,"Despite strong evidence to the contrary1,2,3,4,5, speculation continues that the AIDS virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), may have crossed into humans as a result of contamination of the oral polio vaccine (OPV)6,7,8. This ‘OPV/AIDS theory’ claims that chimpanzees from the vicinity of Stanleyville — now Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of Congo — were the source of a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) that was transmitted to humans when chimpanzee tissues were allegedly used in the preparation of OPV6,7. Here we show that SIVcpz is indeed endemic in wild chimpanzees of this region but that the circulating virus is phylogenetically distinct from all strains of HIV-1, providing direct evidence that these chimpanzees were not the source of the human AIDS pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W1982949972,"The p53 tumor suppressor gene is believed to play an important role in neuronal cell death in acute neurological disease and in neurodegeneration. The p53 signaling cascade is complex, and the mechanism by which p53 induces apoptosis is cell type-dependent. Using DNA microarray analysis, we have found a striking induction of the proapoptotic gene, SIVA. SIVA is a proapoptotic protein containing a death domain and interacts with members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family as well as anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. SIVA is induced following direct p53 gene delivery, treatment with a DNA-damaging agent camptothecin, and stroke injury in vivo. SIVA up-regulation is sufficient to initiate the apoptotic cascade in neurons. Through isolation and analysis of the SIVA promoter, we have identified response elements for both p53 and E2F1. Like p53, E2F1 is another tumor suppressor gene involved in the regulation of apoptosis, including neuronal injury models. We have identified E2F consensus sites in the promoter region, whereas p53 recognition sequences were found in intron1. Sequence analysis has shown that these consensus sites are also conserved between mouse and human SIVA genes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal that both transcription factors are capable of binding to putative consensus sites, and luciferase reporter assays reveal that E2F1 and p53 can activate transcription from the SIVA promoter. Here, we report that the proapoptotic gene, SIVA, which functions in a broad spectrum of cell types, is a direct transcriptional target for both tumor suppressors, p53 and E2F1.

Studies have demonstrated that p53 protein levels are up-regulated following excitotoxicity, hypoxia, and ischemia (2Sakhi S. Bruce A. Sun N. Tocco G. Baudry M. Schreiber S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Finally, recent studies have shown that p53-blocking peptides are neuroprotective following acute brain injury and may serve as potential therapeutic agents (13Culmsee C. Zhu X. Yu Q.S. Chan S.L. Camandola S. Guo Z. Greig N.H. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies demonstrate the importance of p53 as a key apoptotic factor following neuronal injury and underscores the necessity to uncover the mechanisms by which p53 induces the death of postmitotic neurons.The p53 signaling cascade is complex, and it has become increasingly clear that the mechanisms by which p53 induces apoptosis vary depending on the tissue type (reviewed by Prives and Hall (14Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar)). For example, recent studies have demonstrated that, in certain cell types, p53 can induce apoptosis exclusively at the mitochondrial level through direct interaction with Bcl-2 family proteins (15Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). In contrast, other cell types such as postmitotic neurons exposed to DNA-damaging agents require the transcriptional activation domain of p53 for death to occur. 1S. P. Cregan, N. A. Arbour, J. G.

In proliferating cells, Bax was shown to be a direct target for p53 (19Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), however no significant p53-mediated Bax up-regulation was found in neurons (16Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M.

Although we have found that p53 transcriptional activity is essential for the induction of neuronal cell death, the downstream targets responsible for Bax activation remain unknown. To identify the regulatory targets by which p53 induces neuronal cell death, we conducted DNA microarray analysis using postmitotic neurons undergoing p53-mediated apoptosis. Using this approach, we and others (21Moroni M.C. Hickman E.S. Denchi E.L. Caprara G. Colli E. Cecconi F. Muller H. Helin K. Nat.

We have now used DNA microarray analysis to identify p53 target genes involved in neuronal injury and have consistently found a striking induction of the proapoptotic gene, SIVA.SIVA is a proapoptotic protein that was originally identified through its association with the cytoplasmic tail of CD27, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 2The abbreviations used are: TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; Ad, adenovirus; RT, reverse transcription; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DM, double transactivation mutant. 2The abbreviations used are: TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; Ad, adenovirus; RT, reverse transcription; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DM, double transactivation mutant. superfamily (24Gravestein L.A.

SIVA, the CD27-interacting protein was found to contain a death domain homology region, a box-B-like ring finger, and a zinc finger-like domain (27Prasad K.V. Ao Z. Yoon Y. Wu M.X. Rizk M. Jacquot S. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6346-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). More recently SIVA was also found to interact with an additional TNFR family protein, GITR (32Spinicelli S. Nocentini G. Ronchetti S. Krausz L.T. Bianchini R. Riccardi C. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1382-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consistent with its structural domains, forced expression of SIVA has been shown to induce apoptosis when expressed in a number of different cell lines (27Prasad K.V. Ao Z. Yoon Y. Wu M.X. Rizk M.

There are two SIVA splice variants, SIVA-1 and SIVA-2, of which SIVA-1 retains exon2, which is believed to be critical for apoptotic activity (34Yoon Y. Ao Z. Cheng Y. Schlossman S.F. Prasad K.V.

Consistent with an endogenous interaction with Bcl-2 family proteins, SIVA has been localized to the cytoplasm and mitochondria and was recently shown to directly bind to Bcl-XL through this amphipathic domain. Mutation of the SAH domain prevents interaction with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and abrogates its ability to induce apoptosis (33Xue L. Chu F. Cheng Y. Sun X. Borthakur A. Ramarao M. Pandey P. Wu M. Schlossman S.F. Prasad K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6925-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This, as well as studies demonstrating interactions with TNFR family proteins, suggests that SIVA may function through multiple mechanisms that may be dependent on the cell type and apoptotic stimulus. Consistent with a key role in regulating apoptosis in tumor cells, SIVA is up-regulated in response to UV radiation and oxidative stress in a number of cell types (33Xue L. Chu F. Cheng Y. Sun X.

Recently, SIVA was identified through DNA microarray analysis as a p53-induced and DNA damage-induced gene following treatment of colon carcinoma cells with a topoisomerase I inhibitor (37Daoud S.S. Munson P.J. Reinhold W. Young L. Prabhu V.V. Yu Q. LaRose J. Kohn K.W. Weinstein J.N. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2782-2793PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, examination of certain types of cancer has revealed a down-regulation of the SIVA gene along with p53 suggesting that SIVA itself may have a potential role as a tumor suppressor due to its proapoptotic function (38Okuno K. Yasutomi M. Nishimura N. Arakawa T. Shiomi M. Hida J. Ueda K. Minami K. Dis. Colon Rectum. 2001; 44: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).The role of the proapoptotic gene, SIVA, in regulating the death of neuronal cells has not yet been explored. Using DNA microarray analysis to identify p53 target genes involved in neuronal cell death, we have identified SIVA as a p53 target. In addition to its proapoptotic role in the immune system and in tumor cells, we now demonstrate that SIVA also functions in injury-induced apoptosis of postmitotic neurons. By isolation and analysis of the SIVA promoter, we have identified response elements for both E2F1 and p53. Like p53, E2F1 is a tumor suppressor gene (39Yamasaki L. Jacks T. Bronson R. Goillot E.

We have identified E2F consensus sites in the promoter region, whereas recognition sequences for p53 were found in the first intron. Furthermore, these consensus sites are also conserved in the human SIVA gene where E2F sites were also located within the promoter and p53 sites were again found in the first intron. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that both transcription factors are capable of binding their putative consensus sites, and luciferase reporter assays revealed that E2F1 and p53 can activate transcription of the SIVA promoter at these sites. Here, we report that the proapoptotic gene SIVA is a direct transcriptional target for both tumor suppressors, p53 and E2F1.MATERIALS AND METHODSPrimary Neuronal Cultures and Cell Lines—Cortical and cerebellar granule neurons were cultured as described previously (17Cregan S.P.

Murine SN48 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Wisent Inc., St. Bruno, Quebec, Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Wisent Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (23Fortin A.

Neuroepithelia were mechanically dissociated, and single cells were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/ml in uncoated 60-mm Nunclon plates (Invitrogen). Primary neurospheres were expanded for 3–4 days. 7 days post-plating, the neurospheres were pelleted and all but 1–2 ml of media was removed. Neurospheres were triturated to generate a single cell suspension that was centrifuged and resuspended in Neurobasal medium containing B-27 supplement, N-2 supplement, 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 20 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor, 1% nondialyzed fetal bovine serum, and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were plated in Nunc 4-well (2 × 105 cells/well) dishes (Invitrogen) coated with poly-l-ornithine (Sigma-Aldrich).Recombinant Adenovirus Infection and Camptothecin Treatment—cDNA for SIVA was a kind gift from Dr. Kanteti V.

The p53 double transactivation mutant p53-DM (mutations L22E, W23S, W53F, and E54S) was a kind gift from Dr. Xinbin Chen (52Zhu J. Zhang S. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39927-39934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying the SIVA-GFP, GFP, and wild type or mutant p53 expression cassettes were constructed, purified, and titered as described previously (53Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J. Gendron T.F. Callaghan S.M. Park D.S. Parks R.J. Graham F.L. Morley P. Slack R.S. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Prior to use, all recombinant adenovirus vectors were tested and confirmed to be wild type-free. All experiments were performed at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 50 plaque-forming units/cell. Recombinant adenoviral vectors were added to cell suspensions immediately before plating for primary neuronal cultures and 24 h following plating for progenitor cell cultures. Cortical neurons were treated with 10 μm camptothecin (Sigma-Aldrich) 2 days after plating. For viability tests the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide survival assay (Cell Titer Kit, Promega, Madison, WI) that measures the mitochondrial conversion of the tetrazolium salt to a blue formazan salt was used as described previously (9Slack R.S. Belliveau D.J. Rosenberg M. Atwal J. Lochmuller H. Aloyz R. Haghighi A. Lach B. Seth P. Cooper E. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).DNA Microarray Analysis—For p53 microarray analysis, cortical neurons were infected at an m.o.i. of 20 with recombinant adenovirus vectors carrying an expression cassette for either a full-length human p53 (Ad-p53), a transcriptionally defective p53 (Ad-p53-DM), or a DNA-binding mutant p53 (Ad-p53-ΔV). For E2F1 microarray analysis, neural precursor cells were infected at 50 m.o.i. with adenoviral vectors carrying E2F1 (Ad-E2F1) or the control vector Ad-GFP. Total RNA was extracted at 48 (p53) or 72 (E2F1) h post-infection using Tripure isolation reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction (Roche Diagnostics). RNA was sent to the Ottawa Genome Centre Affymetrix GeneChip Facility for analysis.Surgical Procedures—All animal procedures conformed to guidelines endorsed by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Ottawa. Male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) weighing 20–22 g were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion as previously described (23Fortin A. Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J.G. Kushwaha N. Hickman E.S. Thompson C.S. Hakim A. Albert P.R. Cecconi F. Helin K. Park D.S. Slack R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Following reperfusion for 48 or 72 h, brains were removed and the striatum and cortex from the ipsilateral and contralateral sides were dissected separately and tissue was flash frozen using liquid nitrogen prior to protein extraction.Semiquantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells using Tripure isolation reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). Pilot experiments were done to determine the linear range of amplification with respect to quantity of starting template and PCR cycles using mouse-specific primers: SIVA forward (5′-CGCCCATCGCTTGTTCATCGTG-3′) and SIVA reverse (5′-CCGCAGCCCCAGCAGGTGTAT-3′). 6–12 ng of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis and targeted gene amplification using the Super-Script One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis was carried out at 50 °C for 30 min followed by a 2-min initial denaturation step at 94 °C. This was followed by 35 cycles (SIVA) or 25 cycles (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) at 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Primers were designed to amplify nucleotides 329–437 of the SIVA transcript and 139–740 of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript. The resulting product was sequenced and confirmed to be SIVA.Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (17Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J.G. Craig C.G. Robertson G.S. Nicholson D.W. Park D.S. Slack R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7860-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with antibodies against p53 (1C12, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and β-actin (SC-1616, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) as a loading control.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSAs were performed on total protein extracts as described previously (23Fortin A.

In brief, cells were harvested, centrifuged, and extracted in lysis buffer and assayed by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad Laboratories protein assay reagent). 10–20 μg of total cell lysate was incubated with an excess of indicated 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA probes (60,000 cpm/0.2 ng of DNA). Oligonucleotides used included 5′-AGTCTAGACATGGCCTGGCGTCGTGGCTTGTTT-3′ (p53-BS1) and 5′-GTCTATGCAAGCCTGGACATGAGT-3′ (p53-BS2) corresponding to the p53 binding consensus sequences located between +752 to +780 and +897 to +917, respectively, and 5′-CAGAGCCTTCAGGCTTTTCGCGCGCT-3′ (E2F-BS1) and 5′-CGCCCTTGGCCTTTTCCCGCGCC-3′ (E2F-BS2) corresponding to the E2F binding consensus sequences located between -392 to -372 and -296 to -280, respectively, from the transcription start site (+1) referenced from the longest published SIVA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF033114). The binding reaction (25 μl) was carried out at room temperature for 20 min in binding buffer with 0.1 μg of sonicated herring sperm DNA, and, for p53 binding, 1 μl of p53 Ab-1 monoclonal antibody was added to the binding buffer (OP03L; Oncogene Research Products). To control for binding specificity, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide for BS1 and BS2 (p53 and E2F) was added to the binding reaction, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min before the addition of labeled probe. Furthermore, supershifts were performed with a p53-specific antibody FL393 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and an E2F1-specific antibody C20-X (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Complexes were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide, 1× Tris-glycine gel, dried, and visualized by autoradiography.SIVA Promoter Luciferase Reporter Assays—The SIVA luciferase reporter construct (pGL3b-SIVA) was generated by subcloning a murine SIVA gene fragment (-440 to +1770) containing the putative promoter, exon1 and intron1 into the SmaI site of pGL-3 basic (Promega). P53 binding site deletion constructs were generated by excising p53-BS1 (+752 to +780) with BsmB1 and PvuII, p53-BS2 (+897 to +917) with PvuII and EcoR1, and p53-BS1 and p53-BS2 (+752 to +917) with BsmB1 and EcoR1. SN48 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as previously described (23Fortin A. Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J.G. Kushwaha N. Hickman E.S. Thompson C.S. Hakim A. Albert P.R. Cecconi F.

However, the two proteins have distinct biological activities, and expressing them individually in human cells leads to the activation of distinct sets of endogenous genes, suggesting that each protein has a unique transcriptional specificity. Here, the structural and functional features of the Myb proteins were compared, using assays of endogenous gene expression to measure changes in specificity. When the Myb proteins were tested in different cell types, they activated unique and nearly nonoverlapping sets of genes in each cellular context. Deletion and domain swap experiments identified small, discreet positive and negative elements in A-Myb and c-Myb that were required for the regulation of specific genes, such as DHRS2, DSIPI, and mim-1. The results suggest that individual functional elements in the transcriptional activation domains are responsible for activating specific cellular genes in a context-specific manner. The results also have important implications for interpreting results from reporter gene assays, which fail to detect the differences in activity identified through endogenous gene assays, and fusion protein constructs that alter the transcriptional activation domains and the activities of the Myb proteins.

Vertebrates express three highly related Myb transcription factors, A-Myb, B-Myb, and c-Myb, which have highly related DNA-binding domains but distinct biological functions (1Ness S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F123-F139Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The avian c-myb gene is the proto-oncogene progenitor of the v-myb oncogenes, the transforming components of the avian leukemia viruses avian myeloblastosis virus and E26 (1Ness S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F123-F139Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), both of which induce leukemias in birds and transform immature hematopoietic cells in tissue culture. The human c-myb gene (MYB) is highly expressed in proliferating epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells as well as pancreatic, colon and breast tumors and most leukemias and lymphomas (2Golay J.

The three vertebrate Myb proteins have similar overall structures including nearly identical DNA-binding domains near their N termini, central transcriptional activation domains, and C-terminal negative regulatory domains. All three Myb proteins are DNA-binding transcriptional activators, and all activate the same plasmid-based reporter genes in transfection assays (21Rushton J.J. Ness S.A. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It was expected that ectopic expression of the three proteins would lead to the activation of similar sets of endogenous genes. However, when recombinant adenovirus vectors were used to express the A-Myb, B-Myb, or c-Myb proteins in MCF-7 mammary cells, each protein stimulated the expression of a distinct set of endogenous genes (22Rushton J.J. Davis L.M. Lei W. Mo X. Leutz A. Ness S.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting that each protein interacted with unique cofactors or cooperating transcription factors that determined its target gene specificity. Although the DNA-binding domains of A-Myb, B-Myb, and c-Myb are very closely related, they have some differences that could be important for regulating specific genes (1Ness S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F123-F139Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Indeed, changing a single amino acid in the DNA-binding domain of avian myeloblastosis virus v-Myb has been shown to affect its ability to activate some endogenous genes (23Introna M. Golay J. Frampton J. Nakano T. Ness S.A. Graf T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1287-1297Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Alternatively, if the differences in the DNA-binding domains were inconsequential, then other parts of the proteins, such as the unique transcriptional activation domains, must be responsible for the different activities. Such a result would imply that relatively small changes in the transcriptional activation domains could lead to dramatic changes in gene expression. That would have important implications for the use of fusion proteins that alter the transcriptional activation domain, such as Myb-estrogen receptor fusion proteins, which are hormone-regulatable and have been used for identifying potential Myb-regulated genes (24Burk O. Klempnauer K.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3713-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Lyon J.J. Watson R.J.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Such changes could cause qualitative differences in the transcriptional activities of the Myb proteins (37Ness S.A. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2003; 31: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here, the relative importance of differences in the DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domains of Myb proteins was investigated. A series of domain swap and deletion mutants were constructed and compared using reporter gene assays or endogenous gene activation assays in both chicken and human cells. The results have important implications for understanding how the specificities of Myb transcription factors are regulated in different cell types. Plasmid Construction—Chicken A-Myb and c-Myb cDNAs were cloned in pCDNA3 expression vectors (Invitrogen) and have been described (22Rushton J.J. Davis L.M. Lei W. Mo X. Leutz A. Ness S.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The domain swaps were constructed by exchanging fragments of A-Myb and c-Myb after digestion with EcoRI and HincII. The AH, AP, AB, and AN deletions of A-Myb and the CH and CN deletions of c-Myb were constructed by digesting the appropriate cDNAs with restriction enzymes HincII, PstI, BglII, or NsiI (H-N, respectively), converted to blunt ends, and ligated into XbaI/T4 DNA polymerase-treated pCDNA3. The in-frame TAG from the XbaI site in the vector formed the stop codon. The AT, CT, and CX deletions were constructed through PCR amplification using the T7 primer 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ in combination with primers 5′-AATCTAGAAATTCTGCTGAACGGATGTGC-3′, 5′-ATTCTAGAATAAGCAACCATGATCCACTG-3′, or 5′-ATCTCGAGCATGAAAGGCTGGTCCCTG-3′, respectively, using high fidelity polymerase Pfu (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting AT and CT products were digested with XbaI, the CX product was digested with XhoI, and then the fragments were cloned into pCDNA3. All the constructs were verified through nucleotide sequencing. Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Quail fibroblast cells (QT6) were grown and transfected as described previously (8Dash A.B. Orrico F.C. Ness S.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 10Leverson J.D. Ness S.A. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Human 293 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturers. All of the results are representative of at least three independent experiments. Construction of Recombinant Adenoviruses—The cDNAs of chicken A-Myb, c-Myb, or the domain swap or deletion constructs were transferred to the shuttle vector pAdTrack cytomegalovirus and recombined with pAdEasy as described (39He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar), except that bacteria DY329 was used for more efficient recombination (40Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). All the adenovirus vectors were tested through transfection-transduction analysis and Western blotting to ensure that they expressed active Myb proteins of the expected sizes. Microarray Analyses—Gene expression assays in adenovirus-infected MCF7 cells were performed as described previously. Briefly, sufficient virus was used to yield 100% transduced cells, judged by monitoring the coexpressed green fluorescent protein (39He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar), and roughly equivalent levels of Myb proteins, judged by Western blotting. After 16 h, total RNA was prepared using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen). RNA quality was judged using the Lab-on-a-Chip Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA), and then hybridization probes were prepared and hybridized to U95A or U133A GeneChips exactly as described by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), using the Superscript Choice System (Invitrogen) and the RNA transcript labeling kit (ENZO, Farmingdale, NY) for cRNA preparation. Microarray analysis was performed using the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner G2500A, and the samples were scaled to a median fluorescence of 500 units using Microarray Suite 5.0 software (Affymetrix). Replicate samples were generated and analyzed on different days. Affymetrix pivot table data were imported into GeneSpring 5.1 software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA), and the data were normalized on a per gene basis to the median values of the control samples (uninfected and infected with a control adenovirus). The GeneSpring cross-gene error model was used for all analyses. Filtering was used to identify genes that were expressed above a threshold of 1000 raw units in any Myb-expressing samples and that were also induced or repressed at least 2.5-fold relative to the respective control samples or as described in the text. Northern and Western Blotting—To detect the transcription of the mim-1 gene, QT6 fibroblast cells were plated into 6-well plates at a density of 3.75 × 105 cells/well, 24 h before transfecting with Myb and NF-M expression vectors (38Ness S.A. Kowenz-Leutz E. Casini T. Graf T. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) as described above. After 48 h, the cells were harvested by scraping into cold phosphate-buffered saline, 10% of the cells were used for Western blotting, and the rest were used for RNA extraction, as described above. RNAs (5.0 μg) were analyzed in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels, followed by transfer to Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The probes were prepared by labeling mim-1 or β-actin cDNAs with the Rediprime II random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were hybridized multiple times after stripping with 0.1% boiling SDS solution. A similar procedure was used for Northern blots of human cells transduced as described above. The cDNA probes for human genes were isolated through reverse transcriptase-PCR and verified by nucleotide sequencing before use. For Western blots, the proteins were fractionated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed using Myb-specific antibodies as described previously (8Dash A.B. Orrico F.C. Ness S.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Leverson J.D. Koskinen P.J. Orrico F.C. Rainio E.-M. Jalkanen K.J. Dash A.B. Eisenman R.N. Ness S.A. Mol.

Quantification of Northern blot data was performed using Alpha Imager 2200 software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). A-Myb and c-Myb Have Unique, Context-specific Activities—The use of recombinant adenovirus vectors provides a flexible and efficient means of expressing various Myb proteins in a variety of human cells in tissue culture. Previously, we employed that strategy to express A-Myb, B-Myb, and c-Myb proteins in human MCF-7 mammary cells (22Rushton J.J. Davis L.M. Lei W. Mo X. Leutz A. Ness S.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), an epithelial cell line that expresses all three Myb proteins during estrogen-induced proliferation (41Hodges L.C. Cook J.D. Lobenhofer E.K. Li L. Bennett L. Bushel P.R. Aldaz C.M. Afshari C.A. Walker C.L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 300-311PubMed Google Scholar). To extend our previous results, we used the same adenovirus-based approach to compare the activities of A-Myb and c-Myb in two additional cell types: primary lung epithelial cells and primary lung fibroblasts. In each case, the adenovirus titers were adjusted to ensure that roughly equivalent levels of A-Myb and c-Myb were expressed and that essentially all of the cells in the culture were infected (as judged by expression of the coexpressed green fluorescent protein). After 16 h, RNA was prepared from uninfected cells or cells infected with control virus (green fluorescent protein only) or with viruses expressing A-Myb or c-Myb, and changes in gene expression were analyzed using Affymetrix U95Av2 Gene-Chips, containing probe sets for more than 12,000 genes. The data from each cell type were normalized to the respective uninfected or control virus-infected cells. Filtering was used to identify 354 genes that were designated “Present” in at least one sample (using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite software) and that were up- or down-regulated at least 3.5-fold, relative to the controls, in at least one of the experimental conditions. Additional t test filtering identified a subset of 61 genes that were most significant. The results for those 61 genes are summarized in Fig. 1A. The data for the larger set of 354 genes are available as supplementary material. The gene tree in Fig. 1A summarizes the gene expression changes for the 61 genes that were most significantly up- or down-regulated following A-Myb or c-Myb expression in the three cell types. The figure is color-coded to show genes that were down-regulated (blue), unchanged (white), or up-regulated (red). The analysis identified a number of genes whose expression changed as a result of Myb protein expression. The cell type specificities of the affected genes are summarized in the Venn Diagrams shown in Fig. 1B. Ectopic expression of A-Myb (top panel) led to increased or decreased expression of 132, 13, or 108 genes in MCF-7, lung epithelial, or lung fibroblasts, respectively. However, there were no genes that were strongly affected by A-Myb in all cell types. Similarly, 66, 25, and 119 genes were up- or down-regulated following c-Myb expression in MCF-7, lung epithelial, or lung fibroblast cells, respectively (bottom panel). Only three probe sets were affected in all three cell types. Two of them represented the same gene, RRAD, a ras-related GTPase that was up-regulated in the two lung cell types and down-regulated in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1C). The other consistently activated gene was ISG20, an interferon-inducible gene that was up-regulated by c-Myb in all three cell types. Although it is an interferon-inducible gene, ISG20 was not up-regulated in response to the control adenovirus vectors (data not shown), so it appears to respond to expression of c-Myb rather than the adenovirus infection. The Venn Diagrams in Fig. 1D compare the sets of genes most affected by A-Myb and c-Myb in the three cell types. For example, A-Myb and c-Myb caused 132 and 66 genes, respectively, to be up- or down-regulated in MCF-7 cells (bottom panel), including 16 genes that were affected by both Myb proteins. However, many of the latter were regulated in opposite directions. For example, in MCF-7 cells the CAV1 and PTGDS genes (probe sets 36119_at and 216_at, encoding caveolin and prostaglandin D2 synthase, respectively) were up-regulated by A-Myb and down-regulated by c-Myb. In contrast, several genes were down-regulated by A-Myb but up-regulated by c-Myb, including the EMP2 and MUC1 genes (probe sets 39631_at and 38783_at), which encode epithelial membrane protein 2 and mucin 1, respectively. Similar results were obtained for the other two cell types. Despite the fact that A-Myb and c-Myb bind the same DNA sequences and activate the same promoters in reporter gene assays (see below or Refs. 21Rushton J.J. Ness S.A. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar and 22Rushton J.J. Davis L.M. Lei W. Mo X. Leutz A. Ness S.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting that they should be able to access the same promoters in the chromatin, they affected different sets of genes in each cell type. We conclude that the different cellular environments confer unique activities on each Myb protein, probably through alternative protein-protein interactions with tissue-specific coactivators or regulatory proteins. Transactivation Domain Differences in A-Myb and c-Myb—The microarray assays showed that the A-Myb and c-Myb proteins affected the expression of different sets of genes. Because the two proteins have some domains that are nearly identical and others that are unique, experiments were designed to map the domains that were responsible for their different transcriptional activities. The A-Myb and c-Myb cDNAs have conserved EcoRI and HincII restriction sites in the regions encoding the DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domains. These sites were used to construct the domain swap mutants diagrammed in Fig. 2A. For example, the AEC and AHC constructs have the N terminus and DNA-binding domain from A-Myb fused to the remainder of c-Myb at the EcoRI or HincII sites, respectively. The reciprocal swaps resulted in the CEA and CHA constructs. All were first tested in a transfection assay utilizing a plasmid reporter gene with a Myb-responsive promoter. As shown in Fig. 2B, all the Myb proteins activated the reporter construct at least 30-fold, showing that all the proteins were able to bind Myb-responsive promoters and activate transcription. Western blot assays confirmed that all the proteins were of the expected size and were expressed at similar levels in the transfected cells (data not shown). In general, the proteins containing the A-Myb transcriptional activation domains were the most active in this assay, suggesting that A-Myb is a stronger activator than c-Myb. The exception was the AHC swap construct, which combined the A-Myb DNA-binding domain with the c-Myb transcriptional activation domain and which was the most active in the reporter gene assay. Thus, there was no correlation between specific domains in the Myb proteins and the relative activity in the reporter gene assay. A Northern blot assay was used to test whether the Myb proteins could activate endogenous Myb-regulated genes. The avian mim-1 gene is a well characterized gene that is regulated through the cooperative action of c-Myb plus NF-M, the avian CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β protein (38Ness S.A. Kowenz-Leutz E. Casini T. Graf T. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 42Ness S.A. Marknell Å. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of c-Myb plus NF-M results in activation of the endogenous mim-1 gene in a variety of cell types (38Ness S.A. Kowenz-Leutz E. Casini T. Graf T. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, when the A-Myb, c-Myb, and swap construct expression vectors were cotransfected into avian cells along with an NF-M plasmid, all the proteins containing the c-Myb transcriptional activation domains (c-Myb, AEC, and AHC) were able to activate the mim-1 gene. Minor differences in the c-Myb DNA-binding domain can influence interactions with NF-M and affect activation of the mim-1 gene (23Introna M. Golay J. Frampton J. Nakano T. Ness S.A. Graf T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1287-1297Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 38Ness S.A. Kowenz-Leutz E. Casini T. Graf T. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 42Ness S.A. Marknell Å. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, exchanging the A-Myb and c-Myb DNA-binding domains had no such effect. Interestingly, c-Myb, the weakest activator (30-fold) in the reporter gene assay, and AHC, the strongest activator (600-fold) in the reporter assay, activated expression of the endogenous mim-1 gene to similar levels. Thus, the ability to activate mim-1 expression did not correlate with the activities observed in the reporter gene assays. In the mim-1 gene activation assay, the A-Myb and c-Myb DNA-binding domains were interchangeable, but the C-terminal and transcriptional activation domains determined specificity. We conclude that, at least for some Myb-regulated genes, the differences between A-Myb and c-Myb are defined by differences in their transcriptional activation domains. Those differences are qualitative, rather than quantitative and do not correlate with results obtained with reporter gene assays. Mapping Specificity Determinants in A-Myb and c-Myb—The results using the mim-1 assay suggested that differences in the transcriptional activation domains between A-Myb and c-Myb determined their ability to activate specific genes. Microarray assays were used to test this hypothesis on additional target genes. Briefly, adenovirus vectors expressing A-Myb, c-Myb, and the swap constructs CHA and AHC were constructed and used to infect human MCF-7 mammary epithelial cells, as described above. After 16 h, RNA was prepared and analyzed using Affymetrix U133A GeneChips, containing probe sets specific for more than 16,000 human genes. The entire experiment was performed in duplicate, and the gene expression data were normalized to samples that were infected with a control (green fluorescent protein only) adenovirus. Filtering was used to identify 45 genes that met one of the following criteria; they were reproducibly up-regulated 2.5-fold or more as a result of expression of either A-Myb or c-Myb, reproducibly up-regulated by c-Myb at least 2-fold more than by A-Myb or vice versa, or expressed above background in the control samples and reproducibly down-regulated at least 2-fold after either A-Myb or c-Myb expression. The gene expression data from 16 representative genes that displayed domain-specific regulation are summarized in Fig. 3A, where unaffected and up-regulated genes are shaded white or red, respectively. The data for five of the genes are also reproduced in bar graph form in Fig. 3B. The activation of these five genes were confirmed in a separate experiment in which changes in gene expression induced by A-Myb, c-Myb, and all the swap constructs were assessed by Northern blotting (Fig. 3C). Several genes, such as KRT16 and DHRS2, were strongly activated by A-Myb, c-Myb, and all of the swap constructs. However, other genes showed a dramatic difference in activation following expression of the various Myb proteins. For example,"

Like Yck1p, Yck2p terminates with the sequence -Cys-Cys, which is essential for its membrane association and function (7Robinson L.C. Menold M.M. Garrett S. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5350-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a polytopic integral membrane protein originally identified by genetic and two-hybrid analyses as a component in the pheromone response pathway (17Givan S.A.

At least one of the two terminal Cys residues is palmitoylated by the Akr1 protein (20Roth A.F. Feng Y. Chen L. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Akr1p protein acyltransferase activity depends on its cysteine-rich domain (CRD), which contains a conserved Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif (20Roth A.F. Feng Y. Chen L. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 21Lobo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1999; 195: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The DHHC-CRD may be a hallmark of protein acyltransferase activity, because the only two protein acyltransferases characterized in yeast, Akr1p and the Erf2p-Erf4p complex, both possess this motif (20Roth A.F. Feng Y. Chen L. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 21Lobo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. J. Biol.

In addition to the well characterized C-terminal -Cys-Cys sequence, Yck2p plasma membrane localization requires sequences within the final 48 residues of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the enzyme. Deletions within this region impair Yck2p plasma membrane targeting (14Babu P. Bryan J.D. Panek H.R. Jordan S.L. Forbrich B.M. Kelley S.C. Colvin R.T. Robinson L.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4957-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although Yck2p does not possess any known signal sequence, the kinase requires secretory pathway function for its subcellular translocation to the periphery of the cell (14Babu P. Bryan J.D. Panek H.R. Jordan S.L. Forbrich B.M. Kelley S.C. Colvin R.T. Robinson L.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4957-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is currently not known whether the Yck2p CTD is required for palmitoylation, trafficking, or both. For example, the palmitoylated SNAP-25 protein is thought to utilize a neuronal factor to facilitate its secretory pathway-dependent plasma membrane localization (25Loranger S.S. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34303-34309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the palmitoyl moiety itself could provide a Yck2p plasma membrane targeting signal. The acylation of a number of proteins is sufficient to direct their subcellular localization (27Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 32-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), and palmitoylation-deficient H- and N-Ras proteins fail to move from internal membranes to the plasma membrane (29Apolloni A. Prior I.A. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 30Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). We show here that the C-terminal 48 Yck2p residues represent the minimal region required for targeting to the plasma membrane. We also demonstrate that these residues (499–546) are sufficient for Yck2p palmitoylation and that acylation itself is sufficient for plasma membrane targeting of Yck2p. Finally, we show that both C-terminal Cys residues are palmitoylated and that modification of both is required for efficient plasma membrane targeting. DNA Manipulation—Escherichia coli strains DH5α and XL1-Blue (Stratagene) were used for plasmid amplification and subcloning. Restriction enzymes (Promega; American Allied Biochemicals) and DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA was purified either by a rapid boiling preparation (31Taylor R.G. Walker D.C. McInnes R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1677-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) or with the Perfectprep Plasmid Mini kit (Eppendorf). PCR amplification was carried out with Bio-X-Act DNA polymerase (Bioline), and site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene) with Pfu Turbo or Pfu Ultra enzyme using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 9600 or a GeneAmp 2400 (Applied Biosystems) thermocycler. Plasmid DNA prepared by the rapid boiling method was further purified for DNA sequence analysis by RNase treatment, followed by precipitation from polyethylene glycol 8000 (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis of cloned PCR products and of mutagenesis products was carried out either manually, using the Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical) dideoxy chain termination method, or by automated sequencing (Retrogen, Inc.). Construction of Mutant Alleles and Plasmids—Plasmids used for this work are listed in Table I. The yck2-SCIIS allele was constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using pL250 (GFP:YCK2-CCIIS ORF fusion in pUC18ΔEcoRI) as template with primers PB27 and PB28 (Table II), yielding plasmid pPB141. For expression from the GAL1 promoter, the entire mutant GFP:yck2-SCIIS ORF was cloned on a BamHI-SalI fragment into pJB9 (33Robinson L.C. Bradley C. Bryan J.D. Jerome A. Kweon Y. Panek H.R. Mol.

Primers are listed in Table II. In each case, the mutant GFP:YCK2 ORF was cloned on a BamHI-SalI fragment into pJB9 for expression from the GAL1 promoter. To construct the yck2(499–546) allele, a PCR product was generated that encoded only the final 48 amino acids of Yck2p. The PCR product, with a BamHI site at the 5′-end and SalI site at the 3′-end, was amplified from template pL2.99 (YCK2 ORF in pUC18ΔEcoRI) with primers yck2(499–546)F and yck2(499–546)R (Table II). Purified product was digested with BamHI and SalI and cloned into similarly digested pUC18ΔEcoRI, yielding plasmid pL2.60. The GFP ORF was then inserted in-frame as an EcoRI fragment upstream of the YCK2 sequence as described previously (33Robinson L.C. Bradley C. Bryan J.D. Jerome A. Kweon Y. Panek H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1077-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pL2.61. Finally, the GFP:yck2(499–546) allele was cloned on a BamHI-SalI fragment into pJB9 for expression from the GAL1 promoter, yielding plasmid pL2.62. To generate the Cys545 → Ser and Cys546 → Ser mutants, which lack individual palmitoyl-accepting C-terminal Cys residues, plasmid pJB4–4(GFP:YCK2 ORF fusion in pUC18ΔEcoRI) was mutagenized by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with primers PB1 and PB2, or PB3 and PB4, respectively, yielding plasmids pPB5.1 and pPB5.2. The GFP ORF was then inserted in-frame as an EcoRI fragment upstream of the YCK2 sequence as described previously (33Robinson L.C. Bradley C. Bryan J.D. Jerome A. Kweon Y. Panek H.R. Mol. Biol.

Each point mutant fusion allele was then cloned on a BamHI-SalI fragment into pJB9 for expression from the GAL1 promoter, yielding plasmids pHRP45 and pHRP46. Yeast Strains—Yeast strains used for this work are listed in Table III. All LRB strains are closely related and differ only at the indicated loci. Yeast cells were cultured in standard media (34Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Rich media (yeast extract, peptone) and synthetic media (yeast nitrogen base and amino acid supplement) were prepared with 2% carbon source. Yeast transformation was carried out by a LiOAc procedure (35Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H.

Cells were grown in standard rich media or synthetic media to an OD at 600 nm of 0.6–0.9, and calf thymus DNA was used as carrier DNA because it produced the highest efficiency for strains of this genetic background. YCK2 alleles were tested for function by testing for complementation of the temperature-sensitive growth and morphology of strain LRB951 (yck1Δ yck2ts).Table IIIYeast strain listStrainGenotypeSource/referenceLRB906MATahis3 leu2 ura3–52(14Babu P.

Non-transformed cells were similarly grown in synthetic complete media. Endogenous fatty acid biosynthesis was then inhibited with 3 μg/ml cerulenin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min. Galactose was added to a final concentration of 2% to induce GFP fusion expression. 0.5 mCi of [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (5 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was also added at this time, and cultures were incubated for 3 h. Following the labeling reaction, sodium azide (NaN3, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C. Cells were immediately washed with 1 ml of cold TEA (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaN3, 1 mm PMSF) and disrupted by glass bead lysis in 300 μl of cold TEA containing 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC; 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and antipain; Calbiochem). Cleared lysates were prepared from crude extracts by centrifugation at 4 °C. GFP fusion proteins were purified from 500 μg of cleared lysate by incubation in 5 ml of TNET (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100), 0.4% Protein A-agarose beads (Calbiochem), and 17.5 mg of A9298 affinity-purified polyclonal antiserum against GFP (graciously provided by Ulrich Mueller, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) at 4 °C overnight with agitation. Complexed protein was pelleted, washed with 4 × 1 ml TNET, and eluted from the agarose beads in non-reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer, pH 4.0 (5 mm KOAc, pH 4.0, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) at 65 °C for 5 min. Samples were immediately neutralized with an equal volume SDS-PAGE loading buffer, pH 6.8 (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and loaded onto gels as described below. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells transformed with the constructs indicated were grown as described above in 50-ml culture volumes containing 2% raffinose. Galactose was added to a final concentration of 2% to induce GFP fusion expression. After a 3-h induction period, cells were harvested and washed in 5 ml of cold 0.1 m NaN3. Pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of cold spheroplast buffer (1.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaN3, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mg/ml zymolyase (Seikagaku)) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Spheroplasts were then washed with 3 ml of spheroplast wash buffer (1.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaN3) and resuspended in 750 μl of cold lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 10 mm triethanolamine, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF) containing 1× PIC. Samples were lysed manually using pre-chilled pestle tissue grinders (Thomas Scientific) on ice and transferred to pre-chilled microcentrifuge tubes. Tissue grinders were rinsed with 750 μl of cold lysis buffer containing 1× PIC, and washes were pooled with corresponding crude lysates. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 3 min at 450 × g. An aliquot of each cleared lysate was retained as the total (T) fraction. The remainder was transferred to 13 × 51 mm polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter) and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a Beckman Coulter TL-100 ultracentrifuge using a TLA 100.3 rotor. The supernatant was retained as the soluble (S) fraction. Membrane pellets were resuspended in a volume of lysis buffer containing 1× PIC equal to the supernatant, solubilized, and retained as the membranous (M) fraction. Sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% sucrose, 0.05% bromphenol blue) was added to T, C, and M samples prior to freezing or protein analysis. Protein Analysis—Protein samples were separated by electrophoresis through pre-cast 4–20% Tris-glycine denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) using the Criterion SDS-PAGE apparatus (Bio-Rad). For fluorographic analysis, gels were fixed in isopropanol:water: acetetic acid (25:65:10), treated with Amplify fluorographic reagent (Amersham Biosciences) as per manufacturer's instructions, dried, and exposed to film at -80 °C for indicated times. For immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitated samples, gels were blotted to nitrocellulose, probed with monoclonal antiserum against GFP (BD Biosciences/Clon-tech), and visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera (Calbiochem) and the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractionation samples from a wild-type genetic background, affinity-purified polyclonal antiserum against GFP (graciously provided by J. N. Davis, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA) was used for detection. For immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractionation samples from an akr1Δ/akr1Δ genetic background, A9298 polyclonal antiserum against GFP was used for detection. To assess efficiency of fractionation, blots were stripped and reprobed for H+ plasma membrane ATPase (Pma1p) using polyclonal antiserum (graciously provi"
https://openalex.org/W2152194296,"Structure-function relationships of the flavoprotein glycine oxidase (GO), which was recently proposed as the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of thiamine in Bacillus subtilis, has been investigated by a combination of structural and functional studies. The structure of the GO-glycolate complex was determined at 1.8 Å, a resolution at which a sketch of the residues involved in FAD binding and in substrate interaction can be depicted. GO can be considered a member of the “amine oxidase” class of flavoproteins, such as d-amino acid oxidase and monomeric sarcosine oxidase. With the obtained model of GO the monomer-monomer interactions can be analyzed in detail, thus explaining the structural basis of the stable tetrameric oligomerization state of GO, which is unique for the GR2 subfamily of flavooxidases. On the other hand, the three-dimensional structure of GO and the functional experiments do not provide the functional significance of such an oligomerization state; GO does not show an allosteric behavior. The results do not clarify the metabolic role of this enzyme in B. subtilis; the broad substrate specificity of GO cannot be correlated with the inferred function in thiamine biosynthesis, and the structure does not show how GO could interact with ThiS, the following enzyme in thiamine biosynthesis. However, they do let a general catabolic role of this enzyme on primary or secondary amines to be excluded because the expression of GO is not inducible by glycine, sarcosine, or d-alanine as carbon or nitrogen sources.

Glycine oxidase (GO, 1The abbreviations used are: GO, glycine oxidase; DAAO, d-amino acid oxidase; RgDAAO, Rhodotorula gracilis d-amino acid oxidase; pk-DAAO, pig kidney d-amino acid oxidase; MSOX, monomeric sarcosine oxidase; GR, glutathione reductase; r.m.s., root mean square; ASU, asymmetric unit. EC 1.4.3.19) is a flavoprotein consisting of four identical subunits (369 residues each) and containing one molecule of noncovalently bound FAD per 42-kDa protein molecule (1Job V. Marcone G.L. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6985-6993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 2Job V. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GO catalyzes a reaction similar to that of d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO, EC 1.4.3.3), a paradigm of the dehydrogenase-oxidase class of flavoproteins (for a recent review see Ref. 3Pilone M.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1732-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Both enzymes catalyze the oxidative deamination of amino acids to yield the corresponding α-imino acids and, after hydrolysis, α-keto acids, ammonia (or primary amines), and hydrogen peroxide. Both enzymes show a high pKa for flavin N-3H ionization, do not bind covalently the FAD cofactor, and react readily with sulfite (1Job V. Marcone G.L. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6985-6993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 2Job V. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Pilone M.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1732-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), but they differ in substrate specificity. In addition to neutral d-amino acids (e.g. d-alanine, d-proline, etc., which are also good substrates of DAAO), GO catalyzes the oxidation of primary and secondary amines (e.g. glycine, sarcosine, etc.) partially sharing the substrate specificity with monomeric sarcosine oxidase (MSOX, EC 1.5.3.1), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of sarcosine to yield glycine, formaldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide (4Wagner M.A. Schuman Jorns M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). According to investigations of the substrate specificity and of the binding properties, the GO active site seems to preferentially accommodate amines of a small size, such as glycine and sarcosine (1Job V. Marcone G.L. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6985-6993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 2Job V. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GO follows a ternary complex sequential mechanism with glycine, sarcosine, and d-proline as substrates in which the rate of product dissociation from the re-oxidized enzyme form represents the rate-limiting step (5Molla G. Motteran L. Job V. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1474-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Such a kinetic mechanism is similar to that determined for mammalian DAAO on neutral d-amino acids and for the MSOX on l-proline (6Porter D.J.T. Voet J.G. Bright H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4464-4473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wagner M.A. Schuman Jorns M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8825-8829Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); the main difference is represented by the observed reversibility of the GO reductive half-reaction. Taken together, however, these results do not really clarify the function of GO in Bacillus subtilis; they only outline a general catabolic role for GO (1Job V. Marcone G.L. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6985-6993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 2Job V. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recent work proposed GO as the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamine pyrophosphate cofactor in B. subtilis (8Settembre E.C. Dorrestein P.C. Park J.H. Augustine A.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, GO catalyzes the oxidation of glycine to give the imine product that would be trapped with the thiocarboxylate intermediate bound to the following enzyme of the pathway (ThiS). In such a mechanism, the nucleophilic addition might occur at the active site of GO to avoid hydrolysis of the imino product. The known 2.3-Å resolution structure of GO (8Settembre E.C. Dorrestein P.C. Park J.H. Augustine A.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) does not provide direct evidence of such a reactivity. However, this anabolic function of GO is particularly intriguing because amino acid oxidases are usually involved in the catabolic utilization of their substrates. From this point of view, GO resembles l-aspartate oxidase that converts l-aspartate to iminoaspartate using molecular oxygen or fumarate as electron acceptors, the first reaction in the NAD+ biosynthesis pathway in bacteria (9Mattevi A. Tedeschi G. Bacchella L. Coda A. Negri A. Ronchi S. Structure. 1999; 7: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GO is also the object of particular attention because it can be used in an in vitro assay, in parallel to DAAO, to detect and modulate the level of glycine or d-serine in the proximity of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors in human brain. Here we report the crystal structure of B. subtilis GO in complex with the inhibitor glycolate at 1.8 Å resolution. Although the inhibitor was found in an unexpected orientation, active site residues that are likely to bind the substrate or to assist in its oxidation have been tentatively identified on the basis of similarities with other related flavoprotein amine oxidoreductases. In fact, the structures of DAAO, MSOX, and l-amino acid oxidase have also been resolved (10Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 11Umhau S. Pollegioni L. Molla G. Diederichs K. Welte W. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4204-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar); it can thus be expected that comparison of their active sites as well as the mode of interaction with the substrate/ligand would provide insights into the similarities and differences in the structure-function relationships of flavoenzymes active on similar compounds. In addition, and with the aim of clarifying the role of GO in B. subtilis, the effect of different carbon and nitrogen sources on cell growth and on the level of GO expression has been investigated. Growth Conditions and Preparation of Cell Extracts—B. subtilis pre-culture was grown aerobically at 37 °C in the dark and under shaking (180 rpm) on a chemically defined, pH-controlled liquid medium (minimal medium) containing 1× minimal salt solution, 0.4% glucose, 0.005% l-tryptophan, 0.2% l-glutamine, 4 mg/ml FeCl3, 0.2 mg/ml MnSO4, and 1% (v/v) trace element salt solution. The 1× minimal salt solution contained 11.5 mm K2SO4, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 6.2 mm K2HPO4, and 3.4 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0. The 1× trace element salt solution contained 43 μm CaCl2, 12.5 μm ZnCl2, 2.5 μm CuCl2, 2.5 μm CoCl2, and 2.5 μm NaMoO4. This pre-culture was then diluted to a final A600 ∼ 0.08 in 500 ml of minimal medium (2-liter flasks) and grown for 16 h as reported above. The cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 2 ml of 1× minimal salt solution, and finally used to inoculate 600 ml of minimal medium supplemented with the appropriate nutrients (initial A600 ∼ 0.08). Alternatively, a classic M9 medium (containing 1× minimal salt solution, 22 mm glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, and 0.1 mm CaCl2) supplemented with the appropriate nutrient was also used. The cells were grown in flasks as reported above and collected at different growth phases by centrifugation (4000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature) from 100 ml of fermentation broth. Cell growth was followed by absorbance measurements at 600 nm. The crude extracts were prepared according to Ref. 14Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar. In detail, 1 g of cell paste was added to 5 ml of a 2 mg/ml lysozyme solution in TE buffer, pH 8.0, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C; this sample was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20-30 min at room temperature and 10 ml of lysis buffer added to the pellet (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml DNase I). After 15-30 min of incubation, the crude extract was recovered by centrifugation at 14,500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein Analyses, Enzyme Assay, and Gel-permeation Chromatography—B. subtilis crude extracts were employed for the following assays: (a) determination of protein concentration (Biuret method); (b) determination of GO activity (polarographic assay, see below); and (c) determination of the total GO concentration (by Western blot analysis). A fixed amount of protein (≤300 μg) from the crude extract (the soluble fraction obtained after cell disruption and centrifugation) was separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. The same analysis was also performed on whole cell samples by separation of the proteins corresponding to 240 μl of fermentation broth. GO was detected by immunostaining using monospecific rabbit anti-GO antibodies and visualized using anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugated with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride, as reported previously (2Job V. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), or anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugated with a chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce). The amount of anti-GO immunoreactive protein was determined by densitometric analysis using a 50-1000-ng titration curve obtained using pure GO. Glycine oxidase activity was assayed in a thermostated Hansatech oxygen electrode measuring the oxygen consumption at pH 8.5 and 25 °C with 10 mm sarcosine as substrate (1Job V. Marcone G.L. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6985-6993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 2Job V. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). One unit of GO is defined as the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol of substrate (sarcosine or oxygen) per min at 25 °C. The oligomerization state of GO was investigated by means of gel-permeation chromatography on a Superdex™ 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) using 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 8.5, 5% glycerol, and 250 mm NaCl as elution buffer (1Job V. Marcone G.L. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6985-6993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The pH effect on GO oligomerization state was determined by chromatographic separation using 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5 and 7.5), 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH 8.5), or 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate and 25 mm sodium carbonate (pH 9.5), all containing 250 mm sodium chloride and 5% (v/v) glycerol. Limited Proteolysis Experiments—GO (1 mg/ml) was incubated at 25 °C in 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 8.5, and 1% glycerol with 10% (w/w) trypsin, chymotrypsin, or SV8 protease. For electrophoretic analysis, 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to protein samples (10 μg of GO) taken at different times after the addition of protease and immediately frozen for analysis by native PAGE on a 7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel or diluted in the sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, boiled for 3 min, and then loaded on a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 and, only for gels from native PAGE, stained for GO activity as reported previously (1Job V. Marcone G.L. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6985-6993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The oligomerization state of proteolyzed GO samples was determined by gel-permeation chromatography (see above), and their N-terminal sequence was determined by means of automated Edman degradation using a Procise protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Preparation of the Protein and Crystallization—Wild-type GO was expressed in Escherichia coli using the pT7-HisGO expression system in BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells (2Job V. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The pT7-HisGO encodes a fully active fusion protein with 13 additional residues at the N terminus of GO (MHHHHHHMARIRA). The purified protein was concentrated up to 15 mg/ml and equilibrated in 50 mm disodium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol by gel-permeation chromatography on a Sephadex G-25 (PD10) column. The recombinant form of GO was crystallized following dynamic light scattering analysis (DynaPro, Protein Solutions Ltd.) by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, mixing 1 μl of reservoir and 1 μl of protein solution (13 mg/ml) at 18 °C. Crystals with two different space groups were obtained. GO crystals of the space group P6122 were obtained by using a reservoir solution containing 1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.2; the hexagonal crystals grew in 2-3 weeks. Crystals of the space group C2221 were obtained using a GO solution containing 30 mm sodium glycolate and a reservoir solution containing 100 mm imidazole (pH 8.2), 200 mm calcium acetate, and 10% (w/v) PEG 1000; the orthorhombic crystals grew in 1-3 days. Prior to flash-freezing using liquid nitrogen, the crystals were soaked with the corresponding reservoir buffer containing 13% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by addition in the reservoir buffer of KAu(CN)2 or K2Pt(CN)4 to the hexagonal crystal form of GO (1 mm final concentration) and incubating them for 12-16 h. For cryoprotection, the cryoprotectant buffer with an added 1 mm of the corresponding heavy atom salt was used. Solution of the GO Crystal Structure—All data sets were collected under cryogenic conditions at 100 K. For collecting data of the heavy atom derivatives the MAR345 image plate system with a rotating anode x-ray source (Schneider, Offenburg, Germany) was used. A native data set from the hexagonal crystal was measured at the DESY (EMBL, Hamburg) using the MAR345 image plate system. The 1.8-Å GO-glycolate complex was measured from the orthorhombic crystal at the PSI/SLS (Villigen, Switzerland) using a Mar CCD detector 165 mm in diameter. Space group determination and data reduction were carried out with XDS (15Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). The programs SOLVE/RESOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar, 17Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar) were used to solve phases by multiple isomorphous replacement. With MOLREP (18Vagin A.

The second molecule was positioned using O (20Kleywegt G.J. Zou J. Kjeldgaard M. Jones T.A. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E.

This model was used with MOLREP to find the four molecules in the asymmetric unit of the orthorhombic crystal. The GO-glycolate complex was refined with REFMAC5 (22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A.

Description of the Structure—The GO protein used for the present investigations is a chimeric protein containing 13 residues at the N terminus in addition to the 369 amino acids in the native form (1Job V. Marcone G.L. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6985-6993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 2Job V. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The structure of the complex obtained in the presence of glycolate at 1.8 Å is depicted in Fig. 1 (see also Tables I and II). A slightly different protein architecture topology of GO has been shown previously (8Settembre E.C. Dorrestein P.C. Park J.H. Augustine A.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) using the 2.3-Å resolution structure; the secondary structure topology consists of 14 helices (three small 3/10 helices and 11 regular α-helices) and 18 β-strands (Fig. 2). The position of the residues that initiate and terminate the secondary structure elements is frequently different in our structure compared with the previously shown topology (8Settembre E.C. Dorrestein P.C. Park J.H. Augustine A.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The main difference is represented by the three newly identified 3/10 helices (depicted in yellow in Fig. 2); the overall topology is not changed. GO is a two-domain protein, which consists of a FAD-binding domain and a substrate-binding domain. The main structural elements are central antiparallel β-sheets, as first observed in the flavoprotein p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (29Schreuder H.A. Prick P.A. Wierenga R.K. Vriend G. Wilson K.S. Hol W.G. Drenth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 679-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The classic FAD-binding domain is common to the glutathione reductase (GR) class of flavoproteins (30Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 701-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In GO, this motif consists of a six-stranded β-sheet composed of five parallel β-strands (strands 6, 2, 1, 10, and 18) and one additional antiparallel strand (strand 17) and flanked on one side by three α-helices (helices 1, 7, and 10) and on the other side by a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (strands 7-9) and a small α-helix (helix 8). The polypeptide chain crosses between the two domains four times (after helix 4, strand 5, helix 8, and strand 16). The most significant differences between the GO structure and both MSOX and RgDAAO are represented by α-helix 8, which is missing in the other two enzymes, a different α-helix 3 and 4 topology, which is fused to a single continuous helix in RgDAAO and MSOX, and by the three stranded β-sheet (strands 7-9 in GO) of the flavin-binding domain, which is conserved in all GR family members and is not conserved in RgDAAO (10Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 11Umhau S. Pollegioni L.

Another main topological difference with RgDAAO is the absence of the loop consisting of 21 amino acids connecting βF5 and βF6 in RgDAAO (Fig. 1B), which is involved in monomer-monomer interaction and is not present in other known DAAO sequences (11Umhau S. Pollegioni L. Molla G. Diederichs K. Welte W. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12463-12468Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Concerning the substrate-binding domain, an element corresponding to α-helix 6 of GO is not conserved in RgDAAO. Analogously to the yeast DAAO, GO shares an active site loop (connecting strands β13 and β14) that is shorter by 5-8 residues as compared with pkDAAO and MSOX.Fig. 2Secondary structure topology of GO. α-Helices are shown in red; β-sheets are shown in blue, and the newly identified 3/10 helices are shown in yellow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) At the N terminus none of the 13 additional amino acids (MHHHHHHMARIRA) present in recombinant GO can be modeled into the electron density, thus apparently possessing a flexible conformation.

Anisotropy measurements using BODIPY TR and BODIPY FL fluorescent derivatives of ADP and 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP) also indicate an interaction stoichiometry of 1 mol of ADP and 1 mol of triphosphate analogue per MutSα heterodimer.

Simultaneous presence of ADP and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue modulates MutSα·heteroduplex interaction in a manner that is distinct from that observed in the presence of ADP or nonhydrolyzable triphosphate alone, and it is unlikely that this effect is due to the presence of a mixed population of binary complexes between MutSα and ADP or a triphosphate analogue.

Two of these invoke ATP-dependent movement of the protein along the helix, which is postulated to link mismatch recognition to activation of downstream events at the strand signal that directs repair (24Allen D.J.

Electron microscopic visualization of bacterial MutS·heteroduplex complexes has demonstrated the mismatch- and ATP-dependent extrusion of a DNA loop by the bacterial protein (24Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Because nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues do not support loop extrusion and because their addition terminates ongoing loop growth, this reaction has been attributed to directional translocation along the helix in a reaction dependent on ATP hydrolysis by the DNA-bound protein. The use of streptavidin end-blocked linear DNAs has also suggested that MutS and MutSα leave a mismatch in an ATP-dependent manner, observations that have led to the suggestion that the protein may form a mobile clamp about the helix (22Blackwell L.J.

ATPγS·Mg2+, or ATP (no Mg2+) do not, suggesting that formation of such intermediates may depend on ATP hydrolysis by heteroduplex-bound MutSα (25Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The interaction with end-blocked DNA of a mutant form of MutSα, which supports ATP binding but not hydrolysis, has led to a similar conclusion (27Iaccarino I. Marra G. Dufner P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2080-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A mechanism for MutS/MutSα movement along the helix that is independent of ATP hydrolysis by DNA-bound protein has also been proposed (26Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 29Acharya S. Foster P.L. Brooks P. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This molecular switch model posits heteroduplex binding by the MutS/MutSα·ADP complex, mismatch-provoked exchange of ADP for ATP, and free diffusion of the MutS/MutSα·ATP complex along the helix. In this mechanism, ATP hydrolysis occurs after dissociation from the DNA to regenerate the ADP form of the protein. As in the translocation model, this movement is postulated to play an important role in activation of downstream activities that act at the strand signal. Heteroduplex-promoted exchange of ATP for ADP has been demonstrated with human MutSα (21Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R.

Cell. 2003; 12: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar); however, homoduplex DNA also promotes exchange at about 30% of the rate observed with DNA containing a mismatch (28Gradia S.

Cell. 2003; 12: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This modest dependence of exchange rate on a mismatch is seemingly insufficient to account for the observed mismatch dependence of activation of downstream activities (≥20-fold for MutS- and MutL-dependent activation of MutH in the bacterial system (30Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and about 10-fold for mismatch-dependent activation of bacterial and human excision systems (31Grilley M. Griffith J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26136-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). A distinct function for ATP binding and hydrolysis by MutS homologues has also been suggested. In contrast to models invoking ATP-dependent movement of these proteins along the helix, this proposal stipulates that, once mismatch recognition occurs, MutS/MutSα remains bound to the mispair during the course of repair (34Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In this model, interaction of the mismatch and the strand signal is mediated by DNA bending, and ATP binding by DNA-bound MutS/MutSα functions in a kinetic proofreading mechanism that serves to verify mismatch recognition prior to initiation of repair. Although this model has several attractive features, it is inconsistent with the finding that bacterial MutS·MutL and human MutSα·MutLα complexes leave the mispair by movement along the helix contour (29Acharya S. Foster P.L. Brooks P. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 35Galio L. Bouquet C. Brooks P.

Grossman A.D. Walker G.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To further clarify the role of the human MutSα ATPase, we have determined the possible states of nucleotide occupancy of the protein. The stoichiometry of MutSα interaction with ADP and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues indicates that the two nucleotide binding sites within the MSH2·MSH6 heterodimer display differential specificities for ADP and ATP. These studies also show that di- and triphosphate binding sites can be simultaneously occupied at nucleotide concentrations in the low micromolar range.

MutSα fractions, which eluted at about 200 mm KCl, were supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, pooled, and dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES·KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol containing protease inhibitors and 1 m KCl, for 5 h, and then against the same buffer containing 0.2 m KCl for 1 h. After spin concentration at 4 °C using a Centriplus YM-30 (Millipore), samples were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -70 °C. Concentrations of the protein are expressed as heterodimer equivalents and were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient calculated from the primary amino acid sequences of the MSH2 and MSH6 subunits (38Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). Nucleotide content of MutSα preparations was determined by bioluminescent assay as described previously (25Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Previous studies have shown that isolated MutSα can contain significant levels of bound ADP (25Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The dialysis procedure described above results in a significant reduction in the ADP level in MutSα isolates. The preparations used in this study contained about 0.07 mol of ADP per mole of heterodimer and were free of detectable ATP. 5′-Biotinylated and nonbiotinylated oligonucleotides were obtained from Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR). 31-bp G-T heteroduplex and A·T homoduplex substrates were identical to those described previously (24Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Appropriate oligonucleotides were annealed at a 1:1 molar ratio in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Gene Amp 9600 thermocycler by heating to 90 °C in 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, followed by cooling to 15 °C over 90-min period. Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—MutSα-DNA interaction was monitored by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPRS) using a Biacore 2000 optical biosensor system. Streptavidin sensor chips (SA chip, Amersham Biosciences) were prepared according to recommendations of the manufacturer and derivatized with ∼100 resonance units (RUs) of biotinylated heteroduplex or homoduplex DNA. MutSα was injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in buffer comprised of 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20. Experiments were performed at 25 °C, and samples were maintained at 4 °C prior to injection. Adenine nucleotide effects on association of MutSα with DNA were monitored by preincubation of the protein with indicated nucleotides at 4 °C for 5 min prior to injection. Dissociation constants for interaction of MutSα and MutSα·nucleotide complexes with heteroduplex DNA were estimated by SPRS by titration of chip-bound DNA with increasing concentrations of MutSα or MutSα·nucleotide complexes in the buffer system described above. Maximum binding values obtained after completion of the association phase of the reaction were plotted as a function of MutSα concentration, data were fit to a square hyperbola by nonlinear regression analysis, and the Kd value was extracted (22Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34339-34347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Filter Binding Assays—Binding of ADP, ATPγS, and AMPPNP to MutSα was determined in 20-μl reactions containing 20 mm HEPESKOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, MutSα, and [3H]ADP (31.9 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), [35S]ATPγS (65 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), or [α-32P]AMPPNP (32–50 Ci/mmol, ICN Biomed Inc.) as indicated. Labeled nucleotides were diluted prior to use with the corresponding unlabeled compound (ADP, U. S. Biochemical Corp.; ATPγS, Calbiochem-Novabiochem; or AMPPNP, Calbiochem-Novabiochem) to achieve the desired specific activity. Reactions were incubated for 4 min at 0 °C, diluted to 1 ml with room temperature reaction buffer, and immediately filtered through 13-mm, 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, BA-45), which had been pre-washed with reaction buffer. Filters were dried and radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting. For analysis of sequential binding of di- and triphosphates, MutSα was first incubated with a near saturating concentration of one nucleotide for 4 min prior to titration with the second nucleotide. Background nucleotide binding was less than 4%, and data shown were corrected for background values. Human MutSα hydrolyzes ATPγS at a low rate (17Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), potentially compromising interpretation of filter binding experiments using this nucleotide. To evaluate the significance of ATPγS hydrolysis, 8 μm MutSα was incubated under filter binding conditions (0 °C in binding buffer) with 8 μm [35S]ATPγS, the reaction was sampled as a function of time, samples were analyzed by chromatography on PEI-cellulose plates (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) as described (40Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and radioactivity was quantitated using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. This analysis indicated that hydrolysis under filter-binding conditions occurred at a rate of 1.6% per min. In a second approach 8 μm MutSα was incubated with 8 μm [35S]ATPγS for 4 and 8 min at 0 °C, and MutSα·[35S]ATPγS complexes were collected on filters. Filter-bound nucleotide was eluted by 2-h incubation in 10 mm EDTA and 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate at room temperature, and samples were analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described above. Recovered radioactivity was >80% ATPγS for both 4- and 8-min incubations. In similar experiments, 10 μm MutSα was incubated at 0 °C with 50 μm [32P]AMPPNP. No hydrolysis of the ATP analogue was detected after 30 min of incubation. ATP Hydrolysis by MutSα and Nucleotide Occupancy under Steadystate Conditions—Reactions (20 μl) contained 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm MutSα, 100 μm [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, diluted to desired specific activity with unlabeled ATP), and 1 mm MgCl2. Hydrolysis was initiated by addition of [α-32P]ATP and MgCl2 to reaction buffer containing MutSα, and incubation was carried out at 0 °C. Samples (1 μl) were removed as indicated, quenched by addition to 40 μl of 0.2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and samples were spotted on PEI-cellulose plates, which were processed as described above. Parallel reactions (200 μl) were subjected to filter binding analysis to evaluate composition of MutSα-bound nucleotide. Samples (20 μl) were removed at indicated times, diluted to 1 ml with 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and MutSα-nucleotide complexes collected on nitrocellulose membranes as described above. Filters were immediately transferred to 150 μl of 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.2% SDS, and 10 mm EDTA. After 20 min at room temperature, the nucleotide composition of filter eluates was determined by PEI chromatography. Although only trace levels of [32P]AMP (≤0.5%) were observed in ATP hydrolytic reactions after 20 min of incubation, 15% of filter-eluted nucleotide was consistently recovered as AMP. Although the origin of this AMP is not clear, it was not observed in control experiments in which ATP hydrolytic reactions were heated at 70 °C for 5 min and samples were spotted on nitrocellulose membranes, which were then subjected to the filter elution procedure. Fluorescence Measurements—Affinities of MutSα for the fluorescent nucleotide derivatives BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP and BODIPY FL (2′ or 3′)-AMPPNP (Molecular Probes, Inc.) were determined by anisotropy measurement. Reactions contained MutSα and nucleotide as indicated in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Measurements were performed at 4 °C using an SLMAMINCO 8100 Series 2 spectrofluorometer fitted with calcite polarizers using the L-format. The G factor was determined once for each experiment. BODIPY FL (2′ or 3′)-AMPPNP was excited at 490 nm, and maximal emission was observed at 514 nm. Excitation of BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP was at 590 nm with peak emission occurring at 620 nm. Fluorescence anisotropy was calculated using software provided with the instrument. Because there is significant spectral overlap between the emission spectrum of BODIPY FL (2′ or 3′)-AMPPNP and the excitation spectrum of BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP (41Bjornson K.P. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18557-18562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), simultaneous binding of the two nucleotides to MutSα was evaluated by energy transfer. Energy transfer between BODIPY FL (2′ or 3′)-AMPPNP and the BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP acceptor was monitored by exciting at 490 nm and determining the emission at 620 nm. Reaction conditions were as described above for anisotropy measurements using protein and nucleotide concentrations as indicated. Efficiency of energy transfer was determined by the Ratio A method (42Clegg R.M. Murchie A.I. Zechel A. Carlberg C. Diekmann S. Lilley D.M.

A value of for the Förster radius, R0, which is the distance where energy transfer is 50% efficient, was determined to be 38.1 Å (41Bjornson K.P. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18557-18562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This R0 value and the measured efficiency of energy transfer were used to estimate the distance between di- and triphosphate binding centers of MutSα as described (43Clegg R.M.

https://openalex.org/W2060244476,"Targeting of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) to appropriate sites in a cell is mediated by interactions with its PDZ domain and plays an important role in specifying the sites of reaction of nitric oxide (NO) in the central nervous system. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel nNOS-interacting DHHC domain-containing protein with dendritic mRNA (NIDD) (GenBank™ accession number AB098078), which increases nNOS enzyme activity by targeting the nNOS to the synaptic plasma membrane in a PDZ domain-dependent manner. The deduced NIDD protein consisted of 392 amino acid residues and possessed five transmembrane segments, a zinc finger DHHC domain, and a PDZ-binding motif (-EDIV) at its C-terminal tail. In vitro pull-down assays suggested that the C-terminal tail region of NIDD specifically interacted with the PDZ domain of nNOS. The PDZ dependence was confirmed by an experiment using a deletion mutant, and the interaction was further confirmed by co-sedimentation assays using COS-7 cells transfected with NIDD and nNOS. Both NIDD and nNOS were enriched in synaptosome and synaptic plasma membrane fractions and were present in the lipid raft and postsynaptic density fractions in the rat brain. Co-localization of these proteins was also observed by double staining of the proteins in cultured cortical neurons. Thus, NIDD and nNOS were co-localized in the brain, although the colocalizing regions were restricted, as indicated by the distribution of their mRNA expression. Most important, co-transfection of NIDD and nNOS increased NO-producing nNOS activity.

N-Methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, the basis for learning and memory. NMDAR-mediated increases in intracellular Ca2+ trigger various cellular responses, such as activation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which transmits the glutamate signal to the nucleus and ultimately leads to long lasting neuronal responses (3Das U.N. Brain Dev. 2003; 25: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recent studies (4Son H. Hawkins R.D. Martin K. Kiebler M. Huang P.L. Fishman M.C. Kandel E.R.

Pract. 1999; 45: 113-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have suggested that NO is a key molecule linking the NMDAR-mediated increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ and long term potentiation (LTP), a physiological model for learning and memory. NO is thought to mediate synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and influence LTP and thus enhance memory formation. The role of NO in memory formation is also suggested by the observation that the formation of olfactory memory is dependent on NO production (7Kendrick K.M. Guevara-Guzman R. Zorrilla J. Hinton M.R. Broad K.D. Mimmack M. Ohkura S. Nature. 1997; 388: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In the brain, the production and release of NO is induced by glutamate acting on both NMDAR and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid-type glutamate receptor. NO can modulate synaptic plasticity through a cGMP-dependent increase of glutamate release. NO also enhances glutamate release and a subsequent increase in the response of neuronal cell synapses to glutamate. This positive feedback loop appears to be particularly relevant to the hippocampal LTP (8Arancio O. Lev-Ram V. Tsien R.Y. Kandel E.R. Hawkins R.D. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1996; 90: 321-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9573) Google Scholar, 10Morris R.G. J.

In the brain, NO is generated from L-arginine mainly by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) (12Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar). nNOS is unique compared with other NO synthases (NOSs), such as inducible NOS and epithelial NOS (eNOS), in that it contains a PDZ (postsynaptic density protein 95/discs-large/zona occlusens-1) domain at its N terminus. This domain may play a role in the precise localization of nNOS within the cell. We have surveyed the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction-associated mRNAs by random amplification and sequencing (13Tian Q.B. Nakayama K. Okano A. Suzuki T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Among them, the DemA20-5 cDNA fragment of 148 bp was not identified by our initial data base search. In this study, we cloned a full-length DemA20-5 cDNA and re-named it a novel nNOS-interacting DHHC domain-containing protein with dendritic mRNA (NIDD) (GenBank™ accession number AB098078). We also report the regulation by NIDD of nNOS activity via targeting of nNOS to the postsynaptic membrane through a PDZ domain-dependent interaction. Our results suggest that NIDD plays an important role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity by specifying the NO signaling pathway at postsynaptic sites. Materials—pGEM-T easy vector was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Polyclonal rabbit anti-nNOS, monoclonal mouse anti-nNOS, monoclonal mouse anti-eNOS, mouse anti-PSD-95, and anti-flotillin1 antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY).

Nakayama K. Okano A. Suzuki T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cDNA was cloned into pGEM-T easy vector, and the sequences of both strands were determined by the chain termination method with a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit. Data base analyses were performed with the BLAST program (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) and SMART server (smart.embl-heidelberg.de/). RNA Analyses—In situ hybridization in cultured neurons was performed as described previously (13Tian Q.B. Nakayama K. Okano A. Suzuki T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our in situ hybridization protocol was judged to be appropriate because mRNA for the α-subunit of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase was localized in dendrites and that for β-tubulin was restricted to soma under the conditions used previously (13Tian Q.B.

A cRNA probe (nt 217-402 of NIDD) was generated from the linearized plasmid using T7 and Sp6 polymerase according to the protocol of the digoxigenin-labeled cRNA synthesis kit. In situ hybridization in brain sections was performed as described previously (15Sakagami H. Saito S. Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. Kondo H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotide probes (nt 958-1003 and 1363-1407 for NIDD and nt 4468-4512 and 4704-4748 for nNOS; GenBank™ accession number X59949) were labeled with α-35S-dATP by using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. The sagittal and coronal sections were made from Wistar rat brains (7 weeks old) using a cryostat. Hybridization was performed overnight at 42 °C in a solution consisting of 50% deionized formamide, 4× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 1% sodium N-lauroyl sarcosinate, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 200 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 10% dextran sulfate, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of two 35S-dATP-labeled oligonucleotide probes. After washing, the sections were autoradiographed using NTB2 nuclear track emulsion for 1 month at 4 °C. For Northern blotting, poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg) isolated from rat forebrain was size-fractionated on a formamide-containing 1% agarose gel and capillary-blotted to a Hybond-N nylon membrane. The filter was hybridized with the random-primed 32P-labeled probe (nt 4276-5688 of NIDD). The blot was then exposed on an imaging plate overnight, and the hybridization signals were visualized with a BAS-1500 Phosphor-Imager (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). RT-PCR was performed as described previously (16Li W. Okano A. Tian Q.B. Nakayama K. Furihata T. Nawa H. Suzuki T. J. Biol.

The primer sets used for the RT-PCR were as follows: GTAAATCTCTGCTCTCCAAG and CACAATTCGAACCCACTGCTTG (nt 4575-4594 and 5013-5034, respectively, in NIDD). Production of Glutathione S-transferase (GST) Fusion Constructs and Pull-down Assay—Fusion constructs were generated by inserting appropriate restriction fragments in-frame into pGEX4T-1.

Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar); in brief, bacterial pellets were sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% sodium N-lauroyl sarcosinate, 15 mm dithiothreitol, and 3% Triton X-100. For the nNOS pull-down assay, one adult rat cerebellum (250 mg) was homogenized in 2.5 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (25 mm, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (TEE). Cerebellar proteins were solubilized by incubation with 1% Triton X-100 on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 1 h. For the NIDD pull-down assay, proteins (200 μg) of the synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) fraction were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 1 h. After clarification by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min and 1:10 dilution in TEE buffer, the supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 30 μg of GST fusion proteins or GST alone coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B. After incubation, the pulled down materials were washed four times, and the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. The pull-down assays for PSD-95, SAP97, and GRIP were performed using PSD proteins (20 μg) as described previously (16Li W. Okano A. Tian Q.B. Nakayama K. Furihata T. Nawa H. Suzuki T. J. Biol.

Generation of Affinity-purified Anti-NIDD Antibody and Western Blotting—Rabbit anti-NIDD antiserum was raised against a fusion protein of GST with NIDD-NT (GST-NIDD-NT). Antibody was affinity-purified with GST-NIDD-NT chemically immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose 4B after removal of anti-GST antibody with GST-glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Western blotting was performed as described previously (18Murata S. Usuda N. Okano A. Kobayashi S. Suzuki T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 78: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Suzuki T. Ito J. Takagi H. Saitoh F. Nawa H. Shimizu H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 89: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation and Sucrose Density Gradient Flotation Assay—Subcellular fractions were prepared from the forebrains of Wistar rats (6 weeks old, male) as described previously (18Murata S. Usuda N. Okano A. Kobayashi S. Suzuki T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 78: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Suzuki T. Ito J. Takagi H. Saitoh F. Nawa H. Shimizu H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 89: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For the sucrose density gradient flotation assay, proteins (500 μg) of the SPM fraction were suspended by repeated passage through a 26-gauge needle in 1.85 ml of TNE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 0.15% Triton X-100 or 0.5% Rubrol and incubated on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 30 min. The sample was adjusted to 40% sucrose with 80% sucrose in TNE buffer, placed at the bottom of a centrifuge tube, and overlaid successively with 3.75 ml each of TNE buffer containing 30% sucrose and 5% sucrose, respectively. The sample was then centrifuged at 256,000 × gmax for 30 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 11 fractions of 1 ml each were collected sequentially from the top, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of TNE buffer. Proteins in each fraction were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid solution and resuspended in 200 μl of TNE buffer. Equal volumes of the fractions were separated and analyzed by Western blotting. Cell Culture and Transfection of cDNAs—The cerebral cortex or hippocampus of rats (embryonic day 18, Wistar) was dissociated and plated onto a polyethyleneimine-coated glass slide. Neurons were cultured essentially as described previously (20Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar) in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27. COS-7 cells were cultured as described previously (14Tian Q.B. Okano A. Nakayama K. Miyazawa S. Endo S. Suzuki T. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding full-length NIDD, nNOS, and eNOS were amplified by PCR and inserted into appropriate restriction sites of mammalian expression vectors, pcDNA4/HisMax and pcDNA3.1, respectively. The primer sets used were as follows: CGCGGATCCATGAAGCCAGTAAAAAAAAAG and CGCTCGAGTTAGACAATGTCCTCGGCAGG for NIDD; CGGAATTCATGGAAGAGAACACGTTTG and CGCTCGAGTTAGGAGCTGAAAACCTC for nNOS; and GCATGGGCAACTTGAAGAGTG and GAAGAGGGCAGCAGGATG for eNOS (GenBank™ accession number AB176831). The restriction enzyme sites introduced are underlined. Plasmid DNAs were isolated using a Maxi-DNA purification kit. Each plasmid was transfected into COS-7 cells at 90% confluence with the aid of LipofectAMINE 2000. The efficiency of transient transfection in these studies was consistently ∼60% as assessed by fluorescence derived from a control plasmid expressing green fluorescent protein. Immunocytochemistry—Cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and the cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100. The cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum. Slides were incubated with rhodamine- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were observed with a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope. NOS Enzyme Assay—nNOS activity in COS-7 cells was assayed by measuring the conversion of l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline as described previously (21Igarashi J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32363-32370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 22Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol.

We assayed nNOS enzyme activity in two ways. In the first method, after 48 h of transfection, COS-7 cells were incubated in 2 ml of HEPES-KOH buffer (25 mm, pH 7.3) containing 109 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, and 25 mm glucose for 1 h at 37 °C. The assay was started by adding a solution containing l-[3H]arginine (10 μCi/ml, 10 μm) and calcium ionophore A23187 (10 μm) to the culture. Following incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS buffer and lysed in 1 ml of sodium acetate buffer (20 mm, pH 5.5) containing 1 mm l-citrulline, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA. In the second method, the ability of the COS-7 homogenates to convert l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline was assayed. The COS-7 homogenates were incubated in the l-[3H]arginine-containing assay mixture at 25 °C for 15 min according to the protocol of NOS detection kit (Sigma). In both assays, l-[3H]citrulline was separated from l-[3H]arginine and measured by liquid scintillation counting. All experiments were done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Statistical evaluation of the data was performed by Student's two-tailed t test. All data are reported as means ± S.E. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Cloning and Characterization of NIDD cDNA—We have cloned a full-length cDNA of DemA20-5, whose mRNA is associated with the PSD fraction (13Tian Q.B. Nakayama K. Okano A. Suzuki T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and we named it NIDD. Two clones were obtained for NIDD, a long form and a short form (NIDD-L and NIDD-S, respectively). The full-length cDNAs of NIDD-L and NIDD-S were 5867 and 5756 bp long, respectively, and the encoded proteins comprised 429 and 392 amino acids, respectively. NIDD-L contained an additional 111 nucleotides at nt 1009 of NIDD-S, as shown in Fig. 1a. Domain search analysis using the SMART program revealed that NIDD protein contained five transmembrane domains and a zinc finger DHHC domain, which is highly conserved from yeast to humans and possibly involved in protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions (25Putilina T. Wong P. Gentleman S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 195: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, NIDD possessed an -EDIV motif at its C-terminal tail, which was expected to bind to the PDZ domain of nNOS (26Schepens J. Cuppen E. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett Jr., D.E. Bredt D.S. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Homology search using the BLAST program revealed that NIDD had orthologs in the mouse and human genomes (GenBank™ accession numbers XM_285173 and NM_173570, respectively), but there was no homology to any known proteins whose function has been specified. The nucleotide sequence surrounding the first AUG codon in NIDD mRNA agreed well with the Kozak consensus sequence (28Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar) and NIDD mRNA possessed an in-frame stop codon upstream of the first AUG. The human homolog was located on chromosome 3p13.31. Analyses of NIDD Transcript—Because NIDD was originally isolated from mRNAs associated with the PSD fraction, we considered that NIDD mRNA was likely to be localized to neuronal dendrites. To test this possibility, we performed in situ hybridization using cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2a). As expected, the antisense probe revealed that the expression pattern of NIDD mRNA showed a typical dendritic distribution. Dendritic mRNA signals were observed in nearly all the cells with neuron-like morphology. Northern blotting showed a 7-kb major band and an 8-kb minor band (Fig. 2b), which suggested the presence of isoforms. The developmental changes of NIDD expression were examined by RT-PCR (Fig. 2c). The level of NIDD mRNA was high 1 day and 1 week after birth and reduced to about half that level 2 weeks after birth and thereafter. This pattern was confirmed by repeated experiments using different lots of tissue samples. We next determined the expression levels of NIDD mRNAs in various tissues by RT-PCR (Fig. 2d). NIDD was highly expressed in the brain, whereas very low levels of expression were detected in muscle, spleen, lung, and testis. Analyses of NIDD Protein Expression—To examine the expression of NIDD, we carried out immunoblotting analysis with affinity-purified anti-NIDD antibody. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by its specific interaction with His-tagged NIDD protein expressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). The antibody detected doublet bands of 40 kDa in the brain. These doublet bands may be NIDD-S and NIDD-L, judging from their sizes. The 40-kDa bands were not detected in other tissues examined (Fig. 3). The brain-specific expression of NIDD protein was in good agreement with the high level of NIDD mRNA expression in the brain (Fig. 2c). The antibody also detected a weaker band of 42 kDa in muscle and a band of 90 kDa in brain, spleen, lung, and testis. The identities of these 42- and 90-kDa bands are not known at present. Specific Interaction between NIDD and PDZ Domain of nNOS—We examined the interaction between nNOS and NIDD by pull-down assays, because NIDD has at its C-terminal tail an -EDIV motif, which was expected to bind to the PDZ domain of nNOS (26Schepens J. Cuppen E. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett Jr., D.E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48262-48268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). As expected, nNOS was pulled down by NIDD-CT but not by GST alone or by GST-NIDD-del3, a deletion mutant in which the last three amino acid residues of GST-NIDD-CT were deleted (Fig. 4a). Thus, the interaction occurs via the PDZ-binding motif of NIDD. The binding of NIDD-CT was specific for the PDZ domain of nNOS, because it did not pull down other PDZ domain-containing proteins, such as PSD-95, SAP97, or GRIP1 (Fig. 4b). Conversely, NIDD was pulled down by GST fusion protein with the PDZ domain of nNOS (GST-nNOS-PDZ) but not by GST alone (Fig. 4c). Attempts to co-immunoprecipitate NIDD with nNOS, and vice versa, from detergent extracts of rat brain or co-transfected COS-7 cells, have been unsuccessful because of the insolubility of NIDD in nondenaturing detergents (data not shown). In particular, His-NIDD expressed in COS-7 cells aggregated even in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 (data not shown) as observed in Abl-phinlin 2 (Aph2), another zinc finger-DHHC-containing protein involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis (32Li B. Cong F. Tan C.P. Wang S.X. Goff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28870-28876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, we adopted a co-sedimentation assay, instead of co-immunoprecipitation, to examine further the interaction between NIDD and nNOS. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with nNOS (fixed amounts) and His-tagged NIDD (graded amounts). After 48 h of transfection, the cells were lysed in PBS, and the supernatant and the pellet fractions were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-His.G and anti-nNOS antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5, co-expression of His-NIDD caused a dose-dependent shift of nNOS from the supernatant to the pellet, suggesting an interaction between nNOS and NIDD in COS-7 cells. Localization of NIDD at Synaptic Sites—The subcellular localization of NIDD was examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 6). NIDD showed a distribution pattern similar to that of nNOS, except for the soluble fraction (Fig. 6a). NIDD and nNOS proteins were enriched in synaptic fractions such as the synaptosome and SPM fractions, indicating that the two proteins could be co-localized at synaptic sites. NIDD and nNOS were also present in the PSD fraction, although the amounts detected were reduced or minimal, respectively. Most interesting, a 90-kDa NIDD-immunoreactive protein was highly concentrated in the PSD fraction but scarce in the synaptosome and SPM fractions. The NIDD distribution in the SPM was further examined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 6b). The NIDD was distributed in both lipid raft fractions (Fig. 6b, lanes 4-6), although most of it was recovered in the top and 2nd fractions under the conditions used. Treatment of SPM protein with 1% of Triton X-100, or even 0.25%, caused a shift of the distribution of NIDD to the soluble fraction (Fig. 6b, lanes 8-11) and the pellet with no NIDD in the top, the 2nd, and raft fractions (data not shown). Thus, raft distribution became evident under conditions using a relatively low amount of the detergent. Raft localization of NIDD was also shown in the experiment using 0.5% Rubrol. nNOS was distributed in both the raft and non-raft fractions under the conditions we used. The subcellular distribution of NIDD was further examined in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons (Fig. 7). The immunoreactivities for NIDD and nNOS were distributed in and co-localized in the dendrites as well as s"

The chromatin remodeling and DNA-stimulated ATPase activities of Rad54 are significantly enhanced by Rad51. To investigate the functions of Rad54, we generated and analyzed a series of mutant Rad54 proteins. Notably, the deletion of an N-terminal motif (amino acid residues 2-9), which is identical in Rad54 in Drosophila, mice, and humans, results in a complete loss of chromatin remodeling and strand pairing activities, and partial inhibition of the ATPase activity. In contrast, this conserved N-terminal motif has no apparent effect on the ability of DNA to stimulate the ATPase activity or of Rad51 to enhance the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity. Unexpectedly, as the N terminus of Rad54 is progressively truncated, the mutant proteins regain partial chromatin remodeling activity as well as essentially complete DNA-stimulated ATPase activity, both of which are no longer responsive to Rad51. These findings suggest that the N-terminal region of Rad54 contains an autoinhibitory activity that is relieved by Rad51.

Chromatin is the natural form of the DNA substrate in a variety of processes that include transcription, replication, repair, and recombination. The participation of chromatin in these processes involves dynamic changes in its structure. There are two key strategies by which the structure of chromatin is altered. First, the components of chromatin are covalently modified. For instance, the DNA is methylated, such as at CpG residues, and the histones are acetylated, methylated, phosphorylated, ubiquitylated, and ADP-ribosylated (for reviews, see Refs. 1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar, 2Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 3Bannister A.J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Second, the structure of chromatin is reconfigured by ATP-utilizing chromatin remodeling factors, which disrupt histone-DNA contacts in the nucleosome and catalyze nucleosome mobility (for reviews, see Refs. 5Flaus A.

In this reaction, the eukaryotic recombinase Rad51 assembles onto single-stranded DNA (which is generated at the site of a double-strand break) to give a nucleoprotein filament that, upon invasion and annealing to homologous double-stranded DNA, yields a structure termed a D loop. Rad51 belongs to the Rad52 epistasis group of genes (including Rad50, Rad51, Rad52, Rad54, Rad55, Rad57, Rad59, MRE11, and XRS2). These genes, which are conserved from yeast to humans, have been shown to be important for double-strand break repair by homologous recombination. In this study, we focus upon the Rad54 protein. Rad54 is a member of the Rad52 group of genes. In addition, the Rad54 protein is in the Snf2-like family of DNA-dependent ATPases (20Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), which includes the ATPase subunits of a variety of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors such as SWI/SNF, 1The abbreviations used are: SWI/SNF, switch/sucrose non-fermenting; RSC, remodel the structure of chromatin; NURF, nucleosome remodeling factor; ACF, ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor; CHRAC, chromatin accessibility complex; INO80.COM, Ino80 chromatin remodeling complex; NuRD, nucleosome remodeling histone deacetylase complex; RSF, remodeling and spacing factor.

In addition, Rad54 has been found to mediate chromatin remodeling in a reaction that is strongly enhanced by Rad51 (26Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Jaskelioff M. van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 10: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the absence of superhelical tension, strand pairing by Rad51 and Rad54 occurs with much higher efficiency with chromatin templates than with naked DNA templates (26Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To study the biochemical function of Rad54, we have performed a systematic deletion analysis of the Drosophila Rad54 protein. We were particularly interested in the regulation of Rad54-dependent chromatin remodeling by Rad51. We found that an N-terminal nine-amino acid motif, which is conserved in Drosophila, mouse, and human Rad54, plays a key role in the function of the protein. The analysis of a series of mutant Rad54 proteins further suggests that Rad51 may function in part to relieve autoinhibition of chromatin remodeling by Rad54. Plasmids and Proteins—Full-length Drosophila Rad51 and Rad54 proteins with C-terminal FLAG tags were synthesized in Sf9 cells by using a baculovirus expression system as described previously (26Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The deletion and ATPase mutant versions of Rad54 were also synthesized as C-terminally FLAG-tagged proteins. The mutant constructs were prepared by using mutagenesis kits from Clontech and Amersham Biosciences. The complete sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant ACF, recombinant nucleosome assembly protein-1, and core histones from Drosophila embryos were purified as described previously (29Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with plasmid pU6LNS and the DL2 135-mer oligonucleotide, which is complementary to pU6LNS. Briefly, radiolabeled DL2 oligonucleotide was incubated with Rad51 in buffered medium (25 mm Tris acetate at pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase) at 27 °C for 20 min. Then, Rad54 protein and pU6LNS (as plasmid DNA or chromatin) were added, and the reaction was incubated at 27 °C for 4 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to 50 mm and SDS to 1% (w/v). The sample was treated with proteinase K (to 500 μg/ml) at 37° for 20 min and then 0.10 volume of 20% Ficoll, 0.1% bromphenol blue was added. The resulting DNA species were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried on anion exchange chromatography paper (DE81; Whatman) and subjected to autoradiography. In a standard reaction, the final concentrations of the components were as follows: Rad51 (200 nm), Rad54 proteins (46 nm), DL2 oligonucleotide (1 nm), pU6LNS (2 nm). ATPase Assays—ATPase assays were performed under D loop reaction conditions. In a total volume of 30 μl, wild-type or mutant Rad54 protein (23 nm) was incubated in buffered medium (25 mm Tris acetate at pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP) with 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) at 27 °C for the indicated times. Where noted, Rad51 (100 nm) and pU6LNS (2 nm) were included. The reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 50 mm and SDS to 1% (w/v), and 2 μl of the reaction mixtures were subjected to thin layer chromatography on a polyethylenimine cellulose plate (SelectoScientific). Prior to use, the chromatography plate was prerun in water and dried at room temperature for 60 min. The ATP hydrolysis products were resolved in 0.8 m LiCl, 0.8 m acetic acid. The percentage of hydrolyzed ATP was quantitated with a PhosphorImager. Chromatin Remodeling Assays—Restriction enzyme accessibility assays for chromatin remodeling were performed essentially as described previously (26Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Wild-type or deletion mutant Rad54 proteins were incubated with salt dialysis chromatin (reconstituted with pU6LNS) in the presence of the HaeIII restriction enzyme (15 units, Invitrogen) at 27 °C for 1 h in D loop reaction buffer medium. Where indicated, Rad51 and/or ATP was included in the reactions. The samples were deproteinized and subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. In a standard reaction, the final concentrations of the components were as follows: Rad51, 200 nm; Rad54 proteins, 83 nm; chromatin, 2 nm; ATP, 2 mm. Synthesis and Purification of Rad54 Deletion Mutant Proteins—To identify specific functional subregions of Drosophila Rad54, we constructed a series of N- and C-terminal deletion mutant versions of the protein. Rad54 is a member of the Snf2-like family of DNA-dependent ATPases, which share seven conserved motifs (20Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, Rad54 consists of a central region with homology to DNA-dependent ATPases along with N- and C-terminal extensions. The mutant proteins were constructed with C-terminal FLAG tags, synthesized in Sf9 cells by using a baculovirus expression system, and then purified by FLAG immunoaffinity chromatography (Fig. 1B). Some of the mutant proteins, such as Rad54Δ2-75 and Rad54Δ2-100, appear as double bands. Both of these bands were detected with a polyclonal antibody that was raised against a C-terminal fragment of Drosophila Rad54 (amino acid residues 684-784), and thus, the faster migrating species might be N-terminally truncated versions of the mutant proteins or alternatively modified forms of the protein. In the following experiments, we compared the activities of equimolar amounts of the “full-length” mutant Rad54 proteins as estimated by quantitative Western blot analyses with antibodies against Rad54 and/or FLAG peptide. The N Terminus of Rad54 Is Required for Stimulation of Chromatin Remodeling by Rad51—First we sought to test the chromatin remodeling activity of the mutant Rad54 proteins. Rad54 is an ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factor with activity that is strongly stimulated by Rad51 (26Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Jaskelioff M. van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 10: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To analyze chromatin remodeling by the deletion mutant versions of Rad54, we used the restriction enzyme accessibility assay in which the ATP-dependent remodeling of nucleosomes facilitates the access of a restriction enzyme (HaeIII) to DNA packaged into chromatin. We thus tested the Rad54 proteins for chromatin remodeling activity (Fig. 2). With wild-type Rad54, we observed chromatin remodeling that is strongly enhanced by Rad51 as seen previously (26Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Jaskelioff M. van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Alexeev A. Mazin A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The deletion of the N-terminal 50 amino acid residues results in a loss of detectable remodeling activity in the absence or presence of Rad51 (Fig. 2, Δ2-50). Somewhat unexpectedly, there is a partial restoration of chromatin remodeling activity upon deletion of an additional 25 or 50 amino acid residues from the N terminus (Fig. 2A, Δ2-75 and Δ2-100). The stimulation of remodeling by Rad51 appears to be significantly reduced in the Δ2-75 protein and absent in the Δ2-100 protein. Then, upon further deletion of another 25 or 51 amino acid residues, there is no detectable remodeling activity (Fig. 2A, Δ2-125 and Δ2-151). The analysis of C-terminally deleted proteins revealed that the removal of the C-terminal 38 residues results in a protein with chromatin remodeling activity that is comparable with that of wild-type Rad54 (Fig. 2B, Δ747-784), whereas the removal of the C-terminal 112 residues results in a loss of remodeling activity (Fig. 2B, Δ673-784). We further confirmed that chromatin remodeling by the wild-type, Δ2-75, Δ2-100, and Δ747-784 proteins is dependent upon ATP (data not shown). These results indicate that the enhancement of Rad54-mediated chromatin remodeling by Rad51 requires the N terminus of Rad54. The Rad54 Deletion Mutant Proteins Are Mostly Inactive for D Loop Formation—Next we examined whether the Rad54 deletion mutant proteins are active in homologous strand pairing reactions. We and others have seen that Rad54 and Rad51 are able to catalyze D loop formation with a chromatin template and homologous oligonucleotide (26Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Jaskelioff M. van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We observed further that the packaging of DNA into chromatin significantly enhances the efficiency of D loop formation in the absence of superhelical tension (26Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To determine the importance of the N and C termini of Rad54 in strand pairing, we carried out D loop assays with the wild-type and mutant Rad54 proteins. First, we carried out reactions in which we used either supercoiled naked DNA (Fig. 3, DNA) or chromatin prepared by salt dialysis methodology (Fig. 3, Chromatin) along with a homologous oligonucleotide. These experiments revealed that all of the deletion mutant proteins were inactive for D loop formation, except for the Δ747-784 protein, which possesses activity that is comparable with that of wild-type Rad54, and Δ2-75, which exhibits ∼5-10% of the activity of wild-type Rad54 with chromatin and DNA, respectively (Fig. 3A). We also carried out strand pairing reactions with “relaxed” chromatin that was prepared by the assembly of relaxed DNA into chromatin with the ACF and nucleosome assembly protein-1 assembly factors in the presence of topoisomerase I (Fig. 3B). In these experiments, either chromatin or naked DNA control samples were obtained from parallel reactions in which core histones were present or absent. Then we used these DNA templates in strand pairing reactions with the Rad54 proteins and found that the assembly of DNA into chromatin significantly stimulates homologous strand pairing with the wild-type and Δ747-784 Rad54 proteins (Fig. 3C). We did not observe any detectable D loop formation with the other mutant Rad54 proteins. These results indicate that the deletion of the C-terminal 38 amino acid residues of Drosophila Rad54 has little effect on the ability of Rad54 to catalyze chromatin remodeling and homologous strand pairing. On the other hand, the deletion of 50, 100, 125, or 151 amino acid residues from the N terminus or 112 residues from the C terminus results in a loss of strand pairing activity with either supercoiled naked DNA or chromatin. The Δ2-75 mutant protein exhibits a low level of activity for chromatin remodeling and strand pairing. These findings suggest that deletion of residues 51 through 75 results in a partial relief of an inhibitory activity. ATPase Activity of the Rad54 Deletion Proteins—Then we determined the effect of the deletion mutations upon the ATPase activity of Rad54. Rad54 has a DNA-stimulated ATPase activity that is enhanced by Rad51 (25Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Jaskelioff M. van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol.

Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In these experiments, we measured ATP hydrolysis by the Rad54 proteins in the absence or presence of DNA and the further enhancement of the DNA-stimulated ATPase activities by Rad51 (Fig. 4). Wild-type Drosophila Rad54 possesses a DNA-stimulated ATPase activity that is enhanced by Rad51. (We observed the same amount of stimulation of Rad54 DNA-stimulated ATPase activity with either free Rad51 or Rad51 in a nucleoprotein complex with single-stranded DNA (data not shown).) In the absence of DNA, however, Rad51 does not appear to stimulate the ATPase activity of wild-type or mutant Rad54 proteins (Fig. 4B). (With wild-type Rad54 in the absence of DNA, there is a suggestive increase in the level of ATPase activity upon addition of Rad51. Analysis of the results revealed, however, that this difference is not statistically significant.) The Δ2-50 protein has a DNA-stimulated ATPase activity that is further enhanced by Rad51, and the DNA+Rad51-stimulated activity of Δ2-50 is about 25% of that of wild-type Rad54. The Δ2-75 protein has a DNA-stimulated ATPase activity that is comparable with that of wild-type Rad54, but the DNA-stimulated ATPase activities of the Δ2-75 and Δ2-100 proteins are not significantly enhanced by Rad51. The impaired Rad51 enhancement of the DNA-stimulated ATPase activities of the Δ2-75 and Δ2-100 proteins correlates with the reduction of Rad51 stimulation of chromatin remodeling by Δ2-75 and Δ2-100 (Fig. 2A). The Δ2-125, Δ2-151, and Δ673-784 proteins are essentially inactive for ATPase activity. The Δ747-784 protein has an ATPase activity that is similar to that of wild-type Rad54. The N-terminal Nine Amino Acid Residues of Rad54 Are Critical for Chromatin Remodeling and Strand Pairing—The higher chromatin remodeling activities of the Δ2-75 and Δ2-100 proteins relative to the Δ2-50 protein (Fig. 2A) and the insensitivity of the DNA-stimulated ATPase activities of the Δ2-75 and Δ2-100 proteins to enhancement by Rad51 (Fig. 4) prompted us to examine the N-terminal region of Rad54 in greater detail. Perhaps the most notable feature of this region is that the N-terminal nine amino acid residues of human, mouse, and Drosophila Rad54 are identical (Fig. 5A). To test whether these nine residues are important for Rad54 function, we synthesized and purified a mutant Rad54 protein, termed Rad54Δ2-9, in which the conserved N-terminal motif is deleted (Fig. 5B). The DNA+Rad51-stimulated ATPase activity of Δ2-9 protein is about 40% of that of wild-type Rad54 (Fig. 5C). As seen with wild-type Rad54, the ATPase activity of Δ2-9 is responsive to enhancement by Rad51 in the presence but not in the absence of DNA (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the Δ2-9 protein exhibits no detectable activity for either chromatin remodeling (Fig. 5D) or homologous strand pairing in DNA or chromatin (Fig. 5E). These results reveal the importance of the N-terminal motif of Drosophila Rad54 in chromatin remodeling and strand pairing. In addition, the Δ2-9 protein has substantial ATPase activity, and thus, the deletion of the conserved N-terminal motif results in an uncoupling of the ATPase activity from the chromatin remodeling and strand pairing activities. The stimulation of the ATPase activity of Δ2-9 by DNA indicates that it can interact with DNA, and the enhancement of the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of Δ2-9 by Rad51 further suggests that it can interact productively with Rad51 in the presence of DNA. The properties of the Δ2-50 protein are nearly identical to those of the Δ2-9 protein. Thus it seems likely that the properties of the Δ2-50 protein are mostly caused by the loss of amino acid residues 2-9. Upon deletion of 75-100 N-terminal residues of Rad54 (Δ2-75 and Δ2-100), there is a partial recovery of chromatin remodeling activity (Fig. 2) and, to a lesser extent, strand pairing activity (Fig. 3A), and interactions with Rad51 appear to decrease (Figs. 2 and 4). The deletion of residues 51-75 also results in an essentially complete restoration of DNA-stimulated ATPase activity that is insensitive to enhancement by Rad51. Then, upon further deletion of the N terminus of Rad54 (Δ2-125 and Δ2-151), there is a loss of ATPase activity (Fig. 4). Thus, these findings suggest that mutation of the conserved N-terminal motif of Rad54 results in the unmasking of an inhibitory region that blocks chromatin remodeling and strand pairing and partially inhibits ATP hydrolysis but does not affect interactions with DNA or Rad51. Chromatin Remodeling and D Loop Formation Require the ATPase Activity of Drosophila Rad54—Because the Δ2-9 protein is active for ATPase activity and inactive for chromatin remodeling and strand pairing, we tested whether the ATPase activity of Drosophila Rad54 is important for chromatin remodeling and strand pairing. It has been shown that ATPase-defective mutant versions of yeast Rad54 are inactive for D loop formation in chromatin (27Jaskelioff M. van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and nucleosome remodeling (28Alexeev A. Mazin A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, yeast Rad54 does not appear to possess the N-terminal motif that is present in the Drosophila and mammalian Rad54 proteins, and thus, it was possible that there would be some differences in the properties of the yeast and Drosophila proteins. In these experiments, we mutated lysine residue 191 (Lys-191) of Drosophila Rad54 to either arginine or alanine. Rad54 Lys-191 is a residue in the putative nucleotide binding motif and is analogous to yeast Rad54 residue Lys-341, which is important for strand pairing catalyzed by Rad51 and Rad54 (22Petukhova G. van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Jaskelioff M. van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and nucleosome remodeling (28Alexeev A. Mazin A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, Drosophila Rad54(K191R) and Rad54(K191A) proteins were synthesized and purified (Fig. 6A). In ATPase assays, Rad54(K191R) exhibited partial activity, whereas Rad54(K191A) was found to be essentially inactive (Fig. 6B). Next, we carried out chromatin remodeling assays with the mutant proteins and observed that Rad54(K191R) possesses low but detectable activity, whereas Rad54(K191A) is inactive (Fig. 6C). We then performed D loop assays and found that both mutant proteins were essentially inactive with either naked DNA or chromatin substrates (Fig. 6, D and E). Thus, the ATPase activity is important for chromatin remodeling and strand pairing by Drosophila Rad54. These results are generally consistent with those obtained with the analogous mutant versions of yeast Rad54. One slight difference is that we observed partial chromatin remodeling activity with the Drosophila K191R mutant protein, whereas the yeast K341R mutant protein does not exhibit any detectable remodeling activity (28Alexeev A. Mazin A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The difference may be, however, a matter of the sensitivity of the assays rather than a significant distinction in the intrinsic properties of the proteins. In this work, we examined the effect of subregions of Drosophila Rad54 upon ATPase activity, chromatin remodeling, and D loop formation. We identified regions that have both positive and negative effects on chromatin remodeling and D loop formation. In addition, an N-terminal nine-amino acid motif, which is identical in Rad54 in Drosophila, mice, and humans, is important for the function of the protein. It is interesting to consider how Rad51 might affect the activities of Rad54. From previous work, it is known that Rad54 interacts with Rad51 (21Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 32Jiang H. Xie Y. Houston P. Stemke-Hale K. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. Kodadek T. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14029-14036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the presence of DNA, Rad51 enhances the ATPase activity of Rad54 (Fig. 4). This ability of Rad51 to enhance the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of Rad54 reflects a productive interaction between Rad51 and Rad54. Thus, by comparison of the ratio of the rates of ATP hydrolysis by Rad54+Rad51+DNA versus Rad54+DNA (Figs. 4B and 5C), we observed that Rad51 enhances the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of the wild-type, Δ2-9, and Δ2-50 proteins but has a reduced or negligible effect on the Δ2-75 and Δ2-100 proteins (Fig. 4). Also, Rad51 enhances chromatin remodeling by the wild-type protein but has a reduced or negligible effect on remodeling by the Δ2-75 or Δ2-100 proteins (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that a subregion of Rad54 that includes residues 50-75 is important for the stimulation of Rad54 activities by Rad51. We also found that the chromatin remodeling activity of Rad54 is lost upon deletion of the N-terminal 9 or 50 residues (with the Δ2-9 and Δ2-50 proteins) but is then partially regained upon the further removal of another 25-50 residues (with the Δ2-75 and Δ2-100 proteins). In addition, the chromatin remodeling activity does not correlate with the ATPase activity; the Δ2-9 protein is inactive for chromatin remodeling but has substantial ATPase activity. These findings suggest that deletion of a small region of the N terminus of Rad54 results in the unmasking of a motif that inhibits chromatin remodeling activity, and then, upon further deletion to residue 75, the inhibitory motif is removed, and the chromatin remodeling activity is partially restored. In the analysis of the N-terminal deletion series, it is notable that chromatin remodeling activity is regained as the responsiveness of Rad54 to Rad51 is lost. In fact, Rad51 might stimulate chromatin remodeling, at least in part, by counteracting autoinhibition of remodeling by Rad54. In this hypothetical model, the conserved N-terminal nine amino acid residues of Rad54 are required for Rad51 to act as an anti-inhibitor. In this manner, deletion of the N-terminal motif of Rad54 results in constitutive autoinhibition of chromatin remodeling (as seen in Fig. 5). Then, deletion of the Rad54 autoinhibitory region, which appears to be in the vicinity of residues 50 and 75, results in a partial restoration of remodeling activity that is not enhanced by Rad51 (as seen in Fig. 2). From the chromatin perspective, Rad54 is an interesting remodeling protein because it is regulated by Rad51. It is our hope that continued analyses of Rad54 will provide new insights into not only homologous recombination but also the basic mechanisms by which ATP-utilizing factors can alter chromatin structure.

https://openalex.org/W2047509634,"Plk1 (Polo-like kinase 1) is a critical regulator of cell cycle progression that harbors oncogenic activity and exhibits aberrant expression in multiple tumors. However, the mechanism through which Plk1 expression is regulated has not been extensively studied. Here we demonstrate that Plk1 is a target of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) pathway. Activation of RB and related pocket proteins p107/p130 mediate attenuation of Plk1. Conversely, RB loss deregulates the control of Plk1 expression. RB pathway activation resulted in the repression of Plk1 promoter activity, and this action was dependent on the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Although SWI/SNF subunits are lost during tumorigenesis and cooperate with RB for transcriptional repression, the mechanism through which SWI/SNF impinges on RB action is unresolved. Therefore, we delineated the requirement of SWI/SNF for three critical facets of Plk1 promoter regulation: transcription factor binding, corepressor binding, and histone modification. We find that E2F4 and pocket protein association with the Plk1 promoter is independent of SWI/SNF. However, these analyses revealed that SWI/SNF is required for histone deacetylation of the Plk1 promoter. The importance of SWI/SNF-dependent histone deacetylation of the Plk1 promoter was evident, because blockade of this event restored Plk1 expression in the presence of active RB. In summary, these data demonstrate that Plk1 is a target of the RB pathway.

Conversely, Plk1 ablation in tumor cells results in mitotic failure and cell death (9Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 15Liu X.

Plk1 expression is repressed in resting cells and induced only as cells progress through G1/S (18Lee K.S. Yuan Y.L. Kuriyama R. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The induction of Plk1 protein levels is largely dependent on the regulation Plk1 promoter activity, and cis-acting elements that modulate cell cycle dependence have been defined (18Lee K.S. Yuan Y.L. Kuriyama R. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7143-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 20Uchiumi T. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9166-9174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Particularly, the Plk1 promoter is subject to transcriptional repression through cell cycle-dependent element/cell cycle-gene homology region elements that are required for the cell cycle dependence of Plk1 promoter activity (20Uchiumi T. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9166-9174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21Zhu H. Chang B.D. Uchiumi T. Roninson I.B. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 59-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism through which silencing of Plk1 expression occurs as cells exit the cell cycle and the source of the deregulated expression in tumor cells is unknown. A critical regulator of G1/S-dependent gene expression is the RB pathway. RB is functionally inactivated in the majority of tumors via a number of discrete mechanisms (1Sherr C.J. McCormick F. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 2Sherr C.J. Harvey Lect. 2000; 96: 73-92PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sears R.C. Nevins J.R. J. Biol.

It is believed that RB, in concert with the related pocket proteins p107 and p130, functions as a tumor suppressor through its capacity to repress the transcription of critical targets in a cell cycle-dependent manner and thus prevent proliferation (22Nevins J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 23Cam H. Dynlacht B.D. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In G0 or early G1 cells, RB and related proteins are hypophosphorylated and form complexes with the E2F family of transcription factors (24Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 25Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 254: 137-144PubMed Google Scholar). The E2F family of transcription factors are involved in the regulation of numerous genes required for cell cycle progression. RB, p107, and p130 mediate transcriptional repression and subsequent attenuation of E2F-regulated genes by recruiting additional corepressors (e.g. histone deacetylases) that modify chromatin structure (25Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Repression is alleviated when RB family members are phosphorylated by CDK complexes in mid G1, thus enabling progression through the cell cycle (28Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repression is viewed as requisite for RB function in tumor suppression based on genetic and biochemical data (29Harbour J.W. Dean D.C.

Additionally, we and others have found that the loss of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factors compromises RB-mediated transcriptional repression (31Strobeck M.W. Knudsen K.E. Fribourg A.F.

Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). This complex utilizes the energy of ATP to remodel chromatin structure and contains either BRG1 or BRM as the central ATPase (36Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). The activity of the core ATPase subunit is required by the SWI/SNF complex to regulate gene transcription (35Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R185-R197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Prior studies have demonstrated that the combined losses of BRG1 and BRM result in resistance to the activation of the RB pathway and aberrant cell cycle progression (32Strobeck M.W. Reisman D.N. Gunawardena R.W. Betz B.L. Angus S.P. Knudsen K.E. Kowalik T.F. Weissman B.E. Knudsen E.S. J. Biol.

Sherman L.S. Knudsen E.S. Weissman B.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1196-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Additionally, the loss of SWI/SNF activity is associated with a failure of RB to elicit transcriptional repression of specific targets (e.g. cyclin A). Based on studies in yeast, the loss of SWI/SNF could disrupt virtually any step associated with transcriptional repression (35Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 38Fry C.J. Peterson C.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R185-R197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). For example, SWI/SNF could be required for the assembly of E2F proteins at promoter, for the retention of RB or related proteins at the promoter, or for subsequent modifications of the promoter. However, the mechanism through which SWI/SNF cooperates with RB for transcriptional repression is not understood. In this study, we specifically focused on elucidating the regulation of Plk1 expression. We show that Plk1 is repressed via activation of the RB pathway and that Plk1 expression is deregulated through targeted RB loss. Moreover, we demonstrate that the repression of Plk1 by RB is dependent on SWI/SNF activity. Analysis of SWI/SNF function demonstrates that chromatin remodeling is not required for the association of E2F or RB family members at the Plk1 promoter. In contrast, histone deacetylation of the Plk1 promoter was dependent on SWI/SNF and critical for the observed transcriptional repression. Thus, this study provides critical insight into the mechanism through which Plk1 transcription is regulated and demonstrates the intricate relationship between SWI/SNF and histone deacetylases during RB-mediated transcriptional repression.

The Cre-encoding adenovirus was obtained from the Iowa University vector core. Infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 50–100 for ∼95–100% infection efficiency after 24 h as determined by GFP fluorescence. Reporter Assays, Immunoblotting, and RT-PCR—Immunoblotting was performed using standard techniques.

The ChIP assays were repeated at least twice with independent samples. The RB Pathway Regulates Plk1 Expression—The Plk1 gene is subject to deregulated expression in a variety of tumor types and has been shown to harbor oncogenic activity (14Smith M.R. Wilson M.L.

Rubsamen-Waigmann H. Strebhardt K. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1165-1172PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been previously shown that Plk1 is a G1/S-regulated gene (20Uchiumi T. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9166-9174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 44Hamanaka R. Smith M.R. O'Connor P.M. Maloid S. Mihalic K. Spivak J.L. Longo D.L.

However, the mechanisms through which Plk1 expression is controlled or deregulated in human cancers are poorly understood. In a microarray screen we identified Plk1 as a target for RB-mediated repression (45Markey M.P. Angus S.P. Strobeck M.W. Williams S.L. Gunawardena R.W. Aronow B.J. Knudsen E.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6587-6597PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially determined the activity of the RB pathway on Plk1 protein levels (Fig. 1). To activate endogenous RB (and the related proteins p107 and p130), U2OS cells were infected with adenoviruses encoding either GFP (control) or p16ink4a, which prevents their phosphorylation by inhibiting CDK4 activity. As expected, the expression of p16ink4a resulted in RB dephosphorylation (Fig. 1A), indicating endogenous RB pathway activation. Plk1 protein levels were significantly attenuated in those cells infected with p16ink4a encoding adenovirus, as compared with cells infected with the GFP encoding virus (Fig. 1A). To determine whether targeted RB loss, such as occurs in cancer, influences Plk1 expression, conditional knockout of the Rb gene was employed. MAFs of the RbloxP/loxP genotype were infected with recombinant adenoviruses encoding either GFP or Cre-recombinase. In this system, the endogenous Rb locus is subject to recombination through the expression of the Cre-recombinase, and RB protein expression is ablated (not shown). Under this condition, we find that Plk1 protein levels were elevated following RB loss (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Similarly, by microarray analysis we observe a 2.4-fold elevation in Plk1 RNA levels with RB loss. 2M. P. Markey, C. N. Mayhew, and E. S. Knudsen, manuscript in preparation. Thus, endogenous RB serves to maintain the appropriate levels of Plk1. To determine the subsequent action of endogenous RB on attenuating Plk1 protein levels under physiological stress, we examined the expression of Plk1 following exposure to camptothecin (CPT). CPT induces an RB-dependent checkpoint response, wherein specifically those cells deficient in RB (Cre-infected) continue cell cycle progression in the presence of CPT (Fig. 1C). Consistent with protein analyses, MAFs deficient in RB showed up-regulation of Plk1 RNA levels compared with MAFs harboring RB (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1 and 3). Treatment with CPT resulted in the repression of Plk1 RNA levels in RB-proficient MAFs. (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1 and 2). However, Cre-mediated ablation of RB largely relieved the repression of Plk1 transcription following treatment with CPT (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 2 and 4). These observations were further supported by analysis of Plk1 protein levels (Fig. 1E, compare lanes 2 and 4). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Plk1 is a target of the RB pathway, and specific RB loss results in deregulation of this critical target. RB-mediated Repression of Plk1 Is Compromised in SWI/SNF-deficient Cells—Having established that Plk1 protein levels are modulated by the RB pathway, we next sought to elucidate the mechanism of this regulation. Because SWI/SNF activity is compromised in specific cancers (33Reisman D.N. Strobeck M.W. Betz B.L. Sciariotta J. Funkhouser Jr., W. Murchardt C. Yaniv M. Sherman L.S. Knudsen E.S. Weissman B.E.

Cell. 2000; 101: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), the action of SWI/SNF in Plk1 regulation was investigated. The SW13 cell line does not express the BRG1 and BRM ATPases requisite for SWI/SNF activity, whereas TSUPr-1 cells express BRM and are sensitive to RB-mediated signaling (32Strobeck M.W. Reisman D.N. Gunawardena R.W. Betz B.L. Angus S.P. Knudsen K.E. Kowalik T.F. Weissman B.E. Knudsen E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4782-4789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To activate the endogenous RB pathway, adenoviral transduction of p16ink4a that maintains RB in its hypophosphorylated/active state was utilized. As shown, expression of p16ink4a led to the dephosphorylation of RB and related proteins p107 and p130 in both cell types (Fig. 2A). To determine the coordinate action of the RB pathway and SWI/SNF upon Plk1 expression, we initially analyzed Plk1 promoter activity. SW13 cells and TSUPr-1 cells were cotransfected with Plk1 reporter plasmid and either vector control or p16ink4a-encoding plasmids (Fig. 2B). p16ink4a expression potently repressed Plk1 promoter activity in TSUPr-1 cells. In contrast, p16ink4a failed to repress Plk1 in the SW13 cell line. Consistent with the reporter assays, we observed attenuation of endogenous RNA of Plk1 in TSUPr-1 cells infected with p16ink4a (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 3 and 4). As expected, expression of GAPDH did not change in either of these cell lines even when infected with p16ink4a. In contrast, p16ink4a failed to attenuate endogenous RNA levels of Plk1 in SW13 cells (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 2). The SWI/SNF-dependent reduction in promoter activity and RNA levels were reflected in the specific attenuation of Plk1 protein levels by p16ink4a infection in TSUPr-1 cells (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results indicate that SWI/SNF activity is critical for RB pathway-mediated repression of Plk1. To confirm this observation, BRG1 expression was restored in SW13 cells in combination with p16ink4a, and Plk1 promoter activity was analyzed through reporter analysis (Fig. 2E). Similar to our earlier results, p16ink4a alone failed to repress Plk1 promoter activity (Fig. 2E). However, cotransfection of BRG1 and p16ink4a significantly repressed Plk1 promoter activity in the BRG1/BRM-deficient SW13 cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that SWI/SNF activity is required for RB-mediated repression of the Plk1 promoter and attenuation of its RNA and protein levels. SWI/SNF Is Dispensable for the Assembly of E2F or Pocket Proteins at the Plk1 Promoter—Failure of the RB pathway to repress Plk1 in the absence of SWI/SNF activity could be attributed to multiple functions of this complex. In yeast, it has been shown that SWI/SNF activity is required for the assembly of transcription factor complexes on chromatin (38Fry C.J. Peterson C.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R185-R197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 47Burns L.G. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4811-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, SWI/SNF loss could bypass RB-mediated repression through two basic mechanisms. First, SWI/SNF could be required for E2F action. Specifically, SWI/SNF could be required for the expression of E2F family members or for E2F-chromatin interactions that are required for RB pathway-mediated repression (48Wu C.L. Classon M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3698-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Second, SWI/SNF could be required for pocket proteins to associate with E2F factors on target promoters. Initially, we probed the action of SWI/SNF directly on E2F proteins. The E2F family is broadly defined as activating (E2F1–E2F3) or repressive (E2F4 and E2F5) E2Fs based on their predominant transcriptional role (49Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that both SW13 and TSUPr-1 cells expressed similar levels of E2F1 (“activating E2F”) and E2F4 proteins (“repressive E2F”) (Fig. 3A). This result is consistent with microarray analyses that did not identify E2F family members as targets of SWI/SNF (35Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and suggests that limitation of E2F expression does not underlie the resistance to RB pathway activation in SW13 cells. Therefore, several approaches were utilized to subsequently delineate the role of SWI/SNF on the functio"

Therefore, Kcv can be a model for studying the protein design of K+ channel pores. We analyzed the molecular diversity generated by ∼1 billion years of evolution on kcv genes isolated from 40 additional chlorella viruses. Because the channel is apparently required for virus replication, the Kcv variants are all functional and contain multiple and dispersed substitutions that represent a repertoire of allowed sets of amino acid substitutions (from 4 to 12 amino acids). Correlations between amino acid substitutions and the new properties displayed by these channels guided site-directed mutations that revealed synergistic amino acid interactions within the protein as well as previously unknown interactions between distant channel domains. The effects of these multiple changes were not predictable from a priori structural knowledge of the channel pore.

We analyzed the molecular diversity generated by ∼1 billion years of evolution on kcv genes isolated from 40 additional chlorella viruses. Because the channel is apparently required for virus replication, the Kcv variants are all functional and contain multiple and dispersed substitutions that represent a repertoire of allowed sets of amino acid substitutions (from 4 to 12 amino acids). Correlations between amino acid substitutions and the new properties displayed by these channels guided site-directed mutations that revealed synergistic amino acid interactions within the protein as well as previously unknown interactions between distant channel domains. The effects of these multiple changes were not predictable from a priori structural knowledge of the channel pore. Potassium (K+) channels are membrane proteins that mediate K+ flux between the outside and the inside of the cell (1Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA.2001Google Scholar). They are found in all organisms, from bacteria to humans, where they control essential physiological properties, such as osmotic regulation and the duration and shape of action potentials. Potassium channels have recently been found in the genomes of chlorella viruses (2Plugge B. Gazzarrini S. Nelson M. Cerana R. Van Etten J.L. Derst C. DiFrancesco D. Moroni A. Thiel G.

Neurosci. 2002; 3: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and consist of three main components: 1) the pore, formed by two transmembrane helices and a loop between them (2TM/P), 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; wt, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; wt, wild type. that controls selectivity and gating and is a universal feature of K+ channels; 2) four transmembrane helices (S1–S4) that, in voltagegated (Kv) channels precede the pore and endow the channel with the capability of responding to voltage changes, and 3) cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains that exert several regulatory functions. The recent crystallization of the bacterial K+ channels KcsA (5Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) have enhanced our understanding of the structural features of the K+ channel pore. These studies identified the selectivity filter within the pore as the structure responsible for ion selection and suggested that the bundle crossing formed by the inner pore helixes constitutes the intracellular channel gate. However, channels are dynamic structures undergoing global conformational changes in response to effectors (such as voltage and ligands) that open and close the pore. To understand the mechanics of these movements, the coupling of the pore with other regulatory components of the channel as well as the interaction between structural elements within the pore itself need to be described. In the past, structural-functional studies of ion channels have been performed using a “rational” design approach, relying on structural analysis and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis. However, interactions between multiple and dispersed amino acids are not easily predicted with this approach; consequently, other experimental approaches are required to discover these interactions (8Minor Jr, D.L. Masseling S.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1999; 96: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Yifrach O. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Particularly useful are “irrational” protein design approaches, such as random mutagenesis generated by error-prone PCR. This “gene shuffling” technology randomizes the sequence producing multiple mutations, whose effects are not easily predicted by “a priori” structural knowledge because of the interplay of widely dispersed mutations (10Tobin M.B. Gustafsson C. Huisman G.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Like rational design, however, random mutagenesis does not satisfy the statistical complexity of evolution because of its lack of combinatoriality. The complexity of combinatorial protein design experiments implies that the number of possible sequences that can generally be created and screened (106–1012) is infinitesimal compared with the total number possible (2094 = 10133 for the 94-residue Kcv protein) (11Saven J.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This manuscript describes an alternative strategy for identifying functionally important long-range amino acid interactions within the pore region of a K+ channel. For this purpose, we exploit the quasi-unlimited statistical complexity of naturally evolved proteins in which each spontaneous mutation has been selected through millions of years in the context of the surrounding sequence to generate a modified variant of the original sequence. We used as an experimental system the K+ channel protein Kcv, from the chlorella virus PBCV-1, and a natural collection of functional Kcv-variants isolated from 40 additional chlorella viruses. Kcv is a model system to study the pore because this 94 amino acid protein consists only of the pore module (2TM/P) of K+ channels (2Plugge B. Gazzarrini S. Nelson M. Cerana R. Van Etten J.L. Derst C. DiFrancesco D. Moroni A. Thiel G. Science. 2000; 287: 1641-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Kcv forms a functional K+ channel in several heterologous systems (2Plugge B. Gazzarrini S. Nelson M. Cerana R. Van Etten J.L. Derst C. DiFrancesco D. Moroni A. Thiel G. Science. 2000; 287: 1641-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Moroni A. Viscomi C.

Severino M. Lombardi M. Morandi M. DiFrancesco D. Van Etten J.L. Thiel G. Moroni A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and is therefore suitable for validation of functional properties through biophysical analysis. Because a functional Kcv channel is apparently required for the virus to replicate (2Plugge B. Gazzarrini S. Nelson M. Cerana R. Van Etten J.L. Derst C. DiFrancesco D. Moroni A. Thiel G. Science. 2000; 287: 1641-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 3Kang M. Moroni A. Gazzarrini S. DiFrancesco D. Thiel G. Severino M. Van Etten J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5318-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that all the Kcv variants, generated by the long evolutionary history of these viruses (14Van Etten J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 153-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), are functional. They constitute a pool of prescreened (and therefore) functionalized genetic diversity in which selection has removed non-advantageous diversity from the pool of functionality. We have previously described six natural Kcv variants containing 4–12 amino acid substitutions; these variants have different kinetics and permeability properties relative to the reference channel PBCV-1 Kcv (3Kang M. Moroni A. Gazzarrini S. DiFrancesco D. Thiel G. Severino M. Van Etten J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5318-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Comparing patterns of amino acid substitutions with channel properties identified three sets of amino acid substitutions associated with three specific channel properties: 1) K+ current inactivation, 2) high Rb+ permeability, and 3) block by Cs+. Mutational analysis was used to determine whether amino acid substitutions in each set contributed singly or in combination to the channel property. Our results indicate that none of the properties resulted from a single amino acid substitution. Indeed, mutations that do not alter the channel behavior singly nevertheless exert a strong influence reverting the effects of other mutations. Each property is controlled by the synergistic interaction between amino acids located in different pore domains with no obvious physical interactions. Properties such as permeation by Rb+ and block by Cs+, expected to localize to the selectivity filter (15Thompson G.A. Leyland M.L. Ashmole I. Sutcliffe M.J. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol. 2000; 526: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), are the result of a synergistic interaction at two positions, amino acid 19 in the outer helix, TM1, and amino acid 54 in the pore helix. Homology modeling of Kcv suggests that these two positions are far from each other and do not seem to contact the selectivity filter. Thus, these natural Kcv variants reveal interactions between distant domains and, most importantly, not predicted from the current static understanding of channel pore structure. Mutagenesis and Expression of the kcv Genes in Oocytes—Kcv cDNA was cloned into pSGEM vector (a modified version of pGEM-HE, courtesy of M. Hollmann, Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine, Göttingen, Germany). Point mutations were created by the QuikChange method (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing the DNA insert. We prepared cRNA by T7 polymerase transcription and injected it (20–40 ng/oocyte) into Xenopus laevis oocytes, prepared according to standard methods (2Plugge B. Gazzarrini S. Nelson M. Cerana R. Van Etten J.L. Derst C. DiFrancesco D. Moroni A. Thiel G. Science. 2000; 287: 1641-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed 2–4 days after injection. Electrophysiology—A two-electrode voltage clamp (Gene clamp 500; Axon Instruments) was used to record K+ currents from oocytes. Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had a resistance of 0.2–0.8 MΩ (in 50 mm KCl). Oocytes were perfused at room temperature with a standard bath solution containing 50 mm KCl (or RbCl, NaCl, LiCl, CsCl, as indicated in figure legends and text), 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH, at a rate of 2 ml/min. Mannitol was used to adjust the osmolarity of the solution to 215 mosm. The standard clamp protocol consisted of steps from the holding voltage of -20 mV to voltages in the range +80 mV to -160 mV; tail currents were measured at -80 mV. Instantaneous and steady-state currents were sampled after 10 ms and at the end of the voltage step (usually 800 ms), respectively. Ion Permeability—Permeability ratios (PB/PA) were calculated using the equation ΔErev = Erev,B - Erev,A = RT/zF ln PB[B]o/PA[A]o, where Erev is the value in millivolts of the current reversal potential measured in the presence of 50 mm monovalent cation (either [A]o or [B]o) in the external solution, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, z is the ion charge, and F is Faraday's constant (1Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA.2001Google Scholar). Analogy Modeling—Multiple sequence alignments of KCV, Kir-Bac1.1, and various other K+ channels were performed with ClustalX v1.8 software. The alignments were edited manually using the Cinema5 program (aig.cs.man.ac.uk/utopia/). The final alignment was used to match the Kcv sequence to the three-dimensional template of Kir-Bac1.1. with Modeler v6.2 according to Marti-Renom and co-workers (16Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A. Fiser A. Sánchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2559) Google Scholar). Secondary structure of Kcv was predicted by TMPred software (www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html). Rotational symmetry was imposed using local scripts. Final visualizations were generated using MolCad (17Brickmann J. Goetze T. Heiden W. Moeckel G. Reiling S. Vollhardt H. Zachmann C.-D. Bowie J.E.

Kcv (K+ chlorella virus) is a 94-amino acid protein encoded by the genome of PBCV-1 (family Phycodnaviridae), the proto-type of a family of viruses that infect unicellular, eukaryotic, chlorella-like green algae (14Van Etten J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 153-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We have previously described the properties of Kcv and six new Kcv-like channels cloned from 40 chlorella viruses (2Plugge B. Gazzarrini S. Nelson M. Cerana R. Van Etten J.L. Derst C. DiFrancesco D.

Fig. 1 shows the alignment of PBCV-1 Kcv with the six Kcv-like channels, found in viruses CA-4B, AL-2A, AN69C, MA-1D, NY-2A, and NY-2B. Also shown, above the alignment, are channel domains, indicated as slide helix, transmembrane helix 1 (TM1 or “outer”), pore helix, filter, and transmembrane helix 2 (TM2 or “inner”), and defined according to KcsA and KirBac1.1 structures (5Doyle D.A.

The six Kcv-like channels differ from PBCV-1 Kcv by a minimum of four amino acids (CA-4B) to a maximum of 12 amino acids (NY-2B). Amino acid substitutions exist in slide helix, TM1, TM2, pore helix, and also in the selectivity filter sequence “GFG,” highly conserved among K+ channels (1Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA.2001Google Scholar). Positions of key residues of PBCV-1 Kcv are shown in a putative structural model (Fig. 2). This was obtained by aligning PBCV-1 Kcv with KirBac1.1 (Fig. 2A) and homology modeling to the x-ray solved structure of this channel (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Putative location of key amino acid residues of PBCV-1 Kcv.A, alignment of PBCV-1 Kcv to KirBac1.1.

The alignment and the model were generated as explained under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Expression of the six Kcv-like proteins in X. laevis oocytes showed that they all form K+-selective channels and that the properties of the six new K+ channels, or subgroups among them, differ from those of the reference channel PBCV-1 Kcv (3Kang M. Moroni A. Gazzarrini S. DiFrancesco D. Thiel G. Severino M. Van Etten J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5318-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These differences include: 1) inactivation of inward current in K+ solutions (all new channels), 2) absence of inactivation of inward current in Rb+ solutions (all new channels except NY-2B Kcv) and 3) full block of inward current by external Cs+ (AN69C, MA-1D, NY-2A, and NY-2B Kcvs). A comparison of the currents recorded from PBCV-1 Kcv and MA-1D Kcv, a channel that displays all three new properties, is shown in Fig. 3, A and B. The opposite behavior is evident when comparing the inward currents of the two channels: in K+, they activate in PBCV-1 and inactivate in MA-1D; in Rb+, they decrease in PBCV-1 and increase in MA-1D; and in Cs+, they are fully blocked in MA-1D but not in PBCV-1. We operationally describe these properties by the ratio of currents measured at the reference voltage of -100 mV. As reported in Table I, the ratio of the current values measured in Rb+ and K+ solutions was <1 for PBCV-1 Kcv and >1 for MA-1D Kcv (IRb+/IK+ = 0.4 ± 0.09 and 2.0 ± 0.2, respectively). In addition, the ratio between the current measured in the presence and in the absence of 10 mm Cs+ was approximately 1 for PBCV-1 Kcv and near 0 for MA-1D-Kcv (ICs+/IK+ = 0.8 ± 0.04 and 0.1 ± 0.02, respectively).Table ISummary of effects of single and double mutations performed in PBCV-1 and MA-1D Kcv channels Steady-state currents measured at -100 mV in 50 mm Rb+ or 50 mmK+ plus 10 mm Cs+ solutions, are expressed as ratios of current measured in 50 mm K+ only. A value of IRb+/IK+ lower than 1 indicates inactivation in Rb+ and a value higher than 1 indicates removal of inactivation. ICs+/IK+ expresses the degree of Cs+ block and can range from 0 (full block) to 1 (no block). Data are mean of n = number of measured oocytes ± S.E.

Compared with PBCV-1 Kcv, all the new channels have two amino acid substitutions, in positions 19 and 54 in TM1 and in the pore helix, respectively. These substitutions might be related to the inactivation of inward currents in K+, because this is a property shared by all the new channels. Channels that do not show inactivation of inward current in Rb+ (all new channels except for NY-2B) have several conserved residue combinations which are absent in PBCV-1 and NY-2B (Leu-54–Val-64; Leu-54–Phe-66; Leu-54–Leu-78; Leu-54–Ile-84). The combination Leu-54–Phe-66 in the pore helix and selectivity filter is especially intriguing, given the important role of an aromatic residue (Phe or Tyr) in position 66 in the control of ion permeability in K+ channels (19Heginbotham L. Lu Z. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Finally, channels that are completely blocked by Cs+ (AN69C, MA-1D, NY-2A, and NY-2B Kcvs) have three common amino acid substitutions in TM1 (Val-20, Thr-26, and Arg-29) compared with PBCV-1 Kcv, which is only slightly blocked by Cs+. To test the functional relevance of the amino acid combinations mentioned above, site-directed amino acid mutations were made to change the reference channel PBCV-1 Kcv into one of the new channels and vice versa. MA-1D Kcv was chosen for these studies because it exhibits the largest functional distance from PBCV-1 Kcv (it differs in all three properties) with the fewest amino acid substitutions (five substitutions). Interactions between TM1 and the Pore Helix Affect Channel Properties—We examined the effects of single and double amino acid substitutions in positions 19 and 54 in MA-1D Kcv. Substitution at position 19 (V19F) by the corresponding residue from PBCV-1 Kcv produces a channel whose properties are substantially modified and are very similar, although not identical, to those of PBCV-1 Kcv (Fig. 3C, Table I). These similarities include: 1) kinetics in K+ solution more similar to those of PBCV-1 Kcv because of the disappearance of the inactivation kinetics typically present in MA-1D wt Kcv; 2) decrease of inward current when Rb+ replaces K+ (as in PBCV-1 Kcv, IRb+/IK+ <1); and 3) weak inhibition of inward current by Cs+ (as in PBCV-1 Kcv ICs+/IK+ close to 1). The similarity with PBCV-1 Kcv is striking but not complete; indeed, the tail currents upon return to -80 mV in K+ are more similar to MA-1D wt than PBCV-1 wt, and K+ replacement by Rb+ causes only a weak inhibition of inward current relative to PBCV-1 wt. However, when 10 mm Cs+ is added to the K+ solutions, the kinetics of the mutant channel MA-1D V19F resembles PBCV-1 Kcv. In contrast, amino acid substitution at position 54 (L54I) has no effect on the properties of the MA-1D channel (Table I). We were surprised to find that the strong effects of the V19F mutation are suppressed completely in the double mutant MA-1D V19F L54I (Table I and Fig. 4). Substitution at residue 54 completely reverses the effects of mutation 19 on current kinetics in K+ (Fig. 4A) and on inward currents in the presence of Cs+ (Fig. 4B). Consistent with these results is the effect on inward currents in Rb+; whereas the IRb+/IK+ ratio of the mutant V19F is 0.5, that of the double mutant V19F L54I is > 1 (Table I). The opposite single and double amino acid substitutions in positions 19 and 54 were constructed in PBCV-1 Kcv. No effect is observed with the F19V substitution, whereas an increase in Rb+ inward conductance occurs with the I54L mutation. Again, the double mutation (F19V I54L) reverses the effect of the single mutation (I54L) (results summarized in Table I). The results with MA-1D Kcv indicate that both positions, 19 in TM1 and 54 in the pore helix, are important in determining channel properties. In particular, position 19 in TM1 of MA-1D Kcv strongly affects events occurring in the inner pore, such as Cs+ block. The impact of TM1 on pore properties seems to be mediated by the pore helix through position 54, because the effects of the substitutions in positions 19 and 54 are not independent. This interaction also occurs with PBCV-1 Kcv. Furthermore, the results obtained with the double mutants indicate that these two positions, 19 and 54, are not, as we originally expected, solely responsible for channel kinetics. In fact, both double mutants (PBCV-1 Kcv F19V I54L and MA-1D Kcv V19F L54I) have kinetics similar to those of their respective wild-type channels. The lack of effect on kinetics indicates that amino acid residues 19 and 54, although responsible for channel properties, must interact with other positions to exert their effect on channel properties. The Selectivity Filter Interacts with TM1 and the Pore Helix—Additional evidence for an interaction between different domains within the pore was obtained by analyzing channel properties in Rb+ solutions. As mentioned above, PBCV-1 Kcv typically shows strong inward rectification when external K+ is replaced with Rb+ (Fig. 3A). In contrast, none of the new channels, except NY-2B Kcv (Fig. 5), exhibited similar strong inward rectification. The unique behavior of NY-2B Kcv among the new Kcv channels focused attention on position 66 in the selectivity filter. This residue is changed only in NY-2B Kcv. Although three other residues, at positions 64, 78, and 84, are also changed only in NY-2B Kcv, residue 66 is unique because it is highly conserved in all K+ channels. Indeed, an aromatic residue, either Tyr or Phe, is present in this position in all known “one pore” K+ channels. Therefore overlooking amino acids 64, 78, and 84, the only combination of amino acids conserved in all channels that do not inactivate in Rb+ (AN69C, AL-2A, CA-4B, MA-1D, NY-2A) is Leu-54–Phe-66 (Fig. 1). PBCV-1 Kcv and NY-2B Kcv, both of which inactivate in Rb+, lack one of these two amino acids (the combination is Ile-54–Phe-66 in PBCV-1 Kcv and Leu-54–Leu-66 in NY-2B Kcv). The I54L mutation that produced the Leu-54–Phe-66 combination in PBCV-1 Kcv increases the Rb+ current in the PBCV-1 Kcv channel (IRb+/IK+ >1; Table I) and the corresponding current/voltage relations are shown in Fig. 5. As expected, creating a Leu-54–Phe-66 combination in NY-2B Kcv, abolishes its strong inward rectifying behavior in Rb+ (IRb+/IK+ >1; Fig. 5). Again, the results indicate that a single amino acid does not completely determine a given channel property. Amino acid 54 in the pore helix and amino acid 66 in the selectivity filter are predicted by the model to be 13.4 Å apart with no apparent direct interaction. Nevertheless, their concerted action is required to affect Rb+ conductance. The view that channel properties are the result of the interaction between distantly located amino acids was strengthened by the observation that position 19, in TM1, also affects channel behavior in Rb+ (previously mentioned for MA-1D V19F; Fig. 3C). Indeed, the double mutant PBCV-1 Kcv F19V I54L reverses the Rb+ phenotype established by the Leu-54–Phe-66 pair (Fig. 5 and Table I). Hence, TM1 interferes with the Leu-54–Phe-66 phenotype and can suppress it entirely. In summary, these results provide evidence showing the concerted effects on channel function exerted by three different domains in the viral K+ pore protein: the TM1 domain (amino acid 19), the pore helix (amino acid 54), and the selectivity filter (amino acid 66). The results also indicate that identical combinations of residues in these three sites, Val-19–Leu-54–Phe-66 can produce opposite behaviors; e.g. compare MA-1D wt (IRb+/IK+ >1) with PBCV-1F19V I54L (IRb+/IK+ <1). Thus, the resulting phenotype of a channel depends on the combination of these three amino acids within the context of their channel-specific background. Amino Acids 20 and 29 in TM1 Affect Cs+-induced Block—We obtained additional evidence that the role of individual amino acids in the Kcv proteins depends on their global context. PBCV-1 Kcv and MA-1D Kcv sequences differ in five positions: positions 19 and 54 as discussed above, as well as three other positions in TM1: 20, 26, and 29. All channels which are completely inhibited by Cs+ (AN69C, MA-1D, NY-2A, and NY-2B Kcvs) differed from PBCV-1 Kcv in these three TM1 positions. Changing these three residues in MA-1D Kcv individually into the corresponding residues of PBCV-1 Kcv produced no obvious changes in current. In contrast, changing amino acid 20 in PBCV-1 Kcv into the corresponding MA-1D Kcv residue, strongly increased the Cs+-induced block of inward currents (60% at -100 mV; Fig. 6 and Table I). The mutant PBCV-1 I20V Kcv also exhibited other properties, although less pronounced, typical of MA-1D Kcv, such as a tendency to inactivate upon hyperpolarization in the presence of K+ and an increase in inward current in the presence of Rb+ (Table I). A similar increase in Cs+-induced block (65% at -100 mV) occurs in the mutant PBCV-1 K29R (Fig. 6). In this case, however, the mutation affected neither the kinetics of the channel in K+ solution (Fig. 6) nor its behavior in Rb+ solution (Table I). No effect was observed by mutating residue 26. From these results, we conclude that at least two of the three amino acids at positions 20, 26, and 29 are involved in Cs+ sensitivity. Mutations Do Not Alter Na+Permeability or Ba2+Inhibition—All the mutants described in this report were tested for their relative permeability to Na+ compared with K+ and for their sensitivity to Ba2+. The wt channels transported Na+ poorly and were completely blocked by 1 mm Ba2+ (3Kang M. Moroni A. Gazzarrini S. DiFrancesco D. Thiel G. Severino M. Van Etten J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5318-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). None of the mutations altered these parameters, suggesting that the overall pore architecture of the channel proteins was not changed and that structural features involved in Rb+ permeability and Cs+ inhibition differ from those involved in Na+ permeability and Ba2+ inhibition. Previous structure-function studies have identified several amino acids in the pore region of K+ channels that, when individually mutated, strongly influence channel properties (e.g. Refs. 18MacKinnon R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1991; 23: 647-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Heginbotham L. Lu Z. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 20Yellen G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, mutagenesis studies can never be complete because it is nearly impossible to artificially change every amino acid or combination of amino acids in a protein. In the present study, we exploited the high evolutionary pressure exerted by selection on the chlorella virus genomes to maintain a functional K+ channel. The rationale behind this approach is that amino acids change in a protein without bias during evolution. Because the virus apparently requires a functional channel for replication, only mutations that result in a functional channel survive the selection process. Indeed all of the Kcv variants, even those with as many as 12 amino acid substitutions, produce a functional K+ selective channel in X. laevis oocytes (3Kang M. Moroni A. Gazzarrini S. DiFrancesco D. Thiel G. Severino M. Van Etten J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5318-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the physiological properties of the channels differ unexpectedly from the reference channel PBCV-1 Kcv. Our long term goal is to understand the contributions of each amino acid substitution on the overall physiological properties of the channel. The correlation between amino acid changes and the physiological properties of the channels guided site-directed mutations, either singly or in combinations. Comparison of Kcv channels from viruses PBCV-1 and MA-1D was especially enlightening. These two channel proteins differ by only five amino acids and yet they differ dramatically in channel kinetics, cation permeability, and sensitivity to Cs+. Analyses identified functional sites and unexpected long-range interactions in the K+ channel proteins that were previously unknown. The results also indicate that none of the functional properties considered, such as Cs+-induced block or Rb+ permeability, can be attributed to a single residue. Instead, the complex interplay of separate amino acids is responsible for the expression of a functional property. A simple correlation between sequence data and functional features established that amino acids in three different domains affect essential properties of the K+ channel (positions 19 in TM1, 54 in the pore helix, and 66 in the selectivity filter). However, the most important finding in this study is that these positions are not independent. For example, in virus MA-1D, the phenotype obtained by altering amino acid 19 in TM1 is reversed by a second mutation in position 54, indicating that their effects are not additive. It is noteworthy that this occurs even though the substitution in position 54, Leu54Ile, is conservative and does not produce a phenotype when introduced on its own. The simplest explanation for these results is that the two amino acid positions, one located in TM1 and the other in the pore helix, interact. The same conclusion can be reached for these two amino acids by the reverse experiment in which single and double mutations were introduced in PBCV-1 Kcv to match MA-1D Kcv. In addition, in this case, the 19–54 mutant reverses the phenotype induced by the single mutation. However, in this case amino acid 54 produces the altered phenotype. A second example of a long-range interaction was revealed by the Rb+ conductance studies. All the Kcv channels that exhibit high conductance at negative voltages in Rb+ solutions contain Leu-54 and Phe-66 in the pore helix and selectivity filter, respectively. Substituting these two amino acids was sufficient to increase Rb+ conductance in NY-2B and PBCV-1 Kcvs, two channels with a low conductance in Rb+. This result suggests an interaction between the pore helix and the selectivity filter. Position 54 in the pore helix is next to two aromatic amino acids (Tyr Phe) that are highly conserved among all K+ channels; furthermore, the KcsA crystal structure suggests that the pore helix interacts with the selectivity filter (5Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (5729) Google Scholar). It is particularly interesting that: 1) amino acids 54 in the pore helix and 66 in the selectivity filter are affected by the amino acid in position 19 in TM1 and 2) interactions between amino acid positions 19, 54, and 66 are influenced by the general background. Identical amino acid combinations result in different properties in PBCV-1 and NY-2A Kcvs. Analysis of Cs+ inhibition produces a third example of a long-range interaction. All three positions that influence Cs+ sensitivity (amino acids 19 in MA-1D, 20 and 29 in PBCV-1) are located in TM1, which presumably forms the outer helix. Therefore, a feature such as a channel block, which must occur inside the pore (21Ichida A.M. Schroeder J.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Becker D. Dreyer I. Hoth S. Reid J. Busch H. Lehnen M. Palme K. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8123-8128Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Garofoli S. Jordan P.C. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2814-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), is affected by a distant domain. That is, amino acid 19 (or 20 or 29) must interact with the inner pore to change the sensitivity to Cs+ binding. However, when the structure of the bacterial K+ channel KirBac1.1 is used as a reference structure for Kcv (Fig. 2B), amino acid 19 is neither near nor associated with the selectivity filter or the inner pore domain; this result suggests that amino acid 19 is coupled indirectly to the pore domain. The data as a whole predict a coupling of TM1 with the pore via a long range interaction between positions 19 and 66 mediated by position 54 in the turret. Because the architecture of the pore is conserved among K+ channels (24MacKinnon R. Cohen S.L. Kuo A. Lee A. Chait B.T. Science. 1998; 280: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 25Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. Nature. 2001; 413: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to speculate that long range interactions observed in Kcv also occur in other K+ channels. These interactions between TM1 and inner pore, mediated by the pore helix, may represent a more general pathway during global conformational changes, such as those leading to channel activation. An example would be, in voltage-activated channels, the conformational changes transmitting the movement of the voltage sensor to the gate inside the pore (26Tristani-Firouzi M. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18994-19000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 663-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We took advantage of the natural diversity of a family of Kcv channels encoded by chlorella viruses to identify amino acid positions that affect specific channel features. The amino acid substitutions, together with the different physiological properties found in the six new Kcv channels, guided site-directed mutations, either singly or in combinations. By combinatorial analysis of the six channel variants, we identified three functional sites, amino acid positions 19, 54, and 66, that affect K+ channel properties by long distance interactions. It should be noted that a combinatorial analysis of three amino acids within a sequence of 94 amino acids would require screening an extremely large library for detection. Because libraries of this size cannot be easily produced, the present approach offers a valuable tool to identify complex interactions in a K+ channel."

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Each domain uses a set of aromatic amino acid residues for peptide recognition that is conserved within the respective fold family. Within the GYF domain the glycine-tyrosine-phenylalanine tripeptide is part of a bulge-helix-bulge motif that contains several aromatic amino acid side chains that are essential for the binding of the CD2 cytoplasmic domain. The recently solved structure of the CD2BP2-GYF domain in complex with the CD2 peptide SHRPPPPGHRV showed that the peptide adopts an extended conformation and forms a polyproline type II helix involving residues Pro-4 to Pro-7 (Fig. 1) (11Freund C. Kühne R. Yang H.L. Park S. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5985-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Freund C. Kühne R. Park S. Thiemke K. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 27: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The major binding surface of the GYF domain accommodates Pro-6 and Pro-7 of the ligand and is defined primarily by the aromatic residues Tyr-6, Trp-8, Tyr-17, Tyr-20, Trp-28, Tyr-33, and Phe-34 of the GYF domain. Charge complementarity outside the central hydrophobic interaction site is suggested to confer additional specificity (Fig. 1). The CD2 target sequence for the CD2BP2-GYF domain comprises two PPPPGHR motifs that probably can each bind a CD2BP2-GYF domain, thereby enhancing the overall affinity of the interaction (11Freund C. Kühne R. Yang H.L. Park S. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5985-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The PPPPGHR motifs of CD2 are conserved among species and have been shown to mediate CD2-dependent signal transduction (13Chang H.C. Moingeon P. Pedersen R. Lucich J. Stebbins C. Reinherz E.L. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In vitro the CD2BP2-GYF domain and the SH3 domain of the Fyn tyrosine kinase bind to the CD2 tail motifs with similar affinity, showing that a single proline-rich sequence can interact with members of different fold families (11Freund C. Kühne R. Yang H.L. Park S. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5985-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Inversely, a single recognition domain might well interact with proline-rich sequences of several target proteins, but novel protein interactions for the CD2BP2-GYF domain have not been reported thus far. We now show that the signature (R/K/G)XXPPGX(R/K) defines a preferred motif for CD2BP2-GYF domain interactions and that several sequences from spliceosomal proteins that resemble this motif are bound by the CD2BP2-GYF domain in vitro. In particular, sequences from the core snRNP protein, SmB/B′ interact strongly and define potential new target sites for the CD2BP2-GYF domain. The binding epitopes of these peptides and the CD2-derived peptides are very similar, as shown by NMR shift mapping experiments. Furthermore, pull-down experiments with GST-GYF (CD2BP2) show the precipitation of SmB/B′ from Jurkat cell lysates. An EGFP-CD2BP2 fusion protein is primarily compartmentalized to the nucleus of Jurkat and HeLa cells and colocalizes with the SmB/B′ protein. The latter findings reveal a role of CD2BP2 aside from mediating CD2 triggered signal transduction and suggest a function of GYF domain containing proteins in splicing or processes that are associated with splicing. Expression Constructs—Full-length human CD2BP2 was amplified from IMAGE clone IRALp962D081Q2 by PCR using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) and cloned into the XhoI and BamHI restriction sites of the pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech). The amplified sequence of full-length human SmB (IMAGE clone IMAGp998D118415Q3 from the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum) was cloned into the HindIII and SalI restriction sites of the vector pEYFP-C1 (Clontech). Amino acids 280–342 of the CD2BP2 protein, comprising the GYF domain, were cloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pTFT74 (14Freund C. Ross A. Guth B. Plückthun A. Holak T.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) for the expression of GST-GYF and untagged GYF domain, respectively. The sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Preparation—Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified from the soluble fraction after sonication. The untagged 15N-labeled GYF domain was obtained from E. coli grown in defined media supplemented with 15NH4Cl and purified by ion exchange chromatography (Mono Q® HR 10/10, Amersham Biosciences) and subsequent gel filtration (Superdex® 75, Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. GST-GYF (CD2BP2) purification included affinity chromatography (glutathione-Sepharose) according to the manufacturer's manual (Amersham Biosciences) and dialysis against PBS. Binding Studies of Membrane-bound Peptides—Single substitutions of SHRPPPPGHRV and a set of different proline-rich peptides were generated by semiautomated spot synthesis (15Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 16Kramer A. Schneider-Mergener J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 25-39PubMed Google Scholar) (Abimed; Software LISA, Jerini A.G.) on Whatman 50 cellulose membranes as described (17Kramer A. Reineke U. Dong L. Hoffmann B. Hoffmuller U. Winkler D. Volkmer-Engert R. Schneider-Mergener J. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with GST fusion protein as described elsewhere (18Heuer K. Kofler M. Langdon G. Thiemke K. Freund C. Structure. 2004; 12: 603-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membranes were incubated with GST-GYF (CD2BP2; 40 μg/ml) over night. After washing, bound GST fusion protein was detected with rabbit polyclonal anti-GST antibody (Z-5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Rockland). An enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce) on a LumiImager™ (Roche Applied Science) was used for detection. NMR Titration—All NMR experiments were performed at 298 K using a Bruker DRX600 instrument equipped with a standard triple resonance probe. Data processing and analysis were carried out with the XWINNMR (Bruker), Prosa/XEASY (19Eccles C. Guntert P. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and SPARKY (20Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco2004Google Scholar) software packages. In the NMR titration experiments, increasing amounts of synthetic peptides of the sequence NH2-PMGRGAPPPGMMGPPPGMRPPM-COOH (SmB-1), NH2-GTPMGMPPPGMRPPPPGMRGLLCOOH (SmB-2) or NH2-SHRPPPPGHRV-COOH (CD2 peptide) were added to an 0.4 mm sample of the 15N-labeled GYF domain. The gradual change of chemical shifts in the heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectra allowed the resonances of the ligand-bound GYF domain to be unambiguously assigned. The sum of the chemical shift changes for 15N and 1H atoms in a sample with peptide was determined as [(Δ1H_cs)2 + (Δ15N_cs)2]1/2, where Δ1H_cs is in units of 0.1 ppm, and Δ15N_cs is in units of 0.5 ppm. Cell Culture and Lysis—Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C humidified incubator. Cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed for 30 min by gentle rocking in lysis buffer (25 mm1 Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin and leupeptin (both 5 μg/ml), 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). Cell lysates were centrifuged in order to remove the insoluble cell debris and were either used directly or snap-frozen and stored at –80 °C. Human HeLa S3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom) supplemented with streptomycin and penicillin. GST Pulldown Assay—100 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins were incubated with 50 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times with PBS, and a small aliquot was analyzed by SDS-PAGE to ascertain that the loading of each fusion construct was similar. The pulldown experiment was carried out by first preclearing the cell lysates with 50 μl of GST-loaded glutathione beads. Following removal of the beads, precleared lysates (∼3 × 108 cells/experiment) were incubated with GST-, GST-GYF (CD2BP2)-, or GST-hSH3-loaded beads (18Heuer K. Kofler M. Langdon G. Thiemke K. Freund C. Structure. 2004; 12: 603-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) for 2–4 h at 4 °C. Where required, a specific (SmB-2) or nonspecific peptide (Pep-1: NH2-KETWWETWWTEWSQPKKKRKV-COOH) was added to the lysates to a final concentration of 1 mm. Beads were washed five times with 10 ml of PBS. Bound proteins were eluted in gel loading buffer by boiling and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were probed with an anti-SmB/B′ antibody (sc-5485, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunoblots were then developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce) and detected by a LumiImager™ (Roche Applied Science). Transfections and Fluorescence Microscopy—3 × 106 Jurkat J77 cells were transfected by nucleoporation using 2.0 μg of DNA, the Amaxa Nucleofection Kit V (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) and a Nucleofector device (program T-14). HeLa S3 cells were grown on glass coverslips in 12 well plates and transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE plus (GIBCO) and 0.4 μg of DNA/well according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after transfection Jurkat and HeLa cells were fixed on poly-l-lysine-coated slides (Menzel-Glaeser) with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (5 μg/ml in H2O) for 2 min. After being washed twice with PBS, all cells were mounted in Fluoromount-G mounting medium for fluorescence microscopy (Southern Biotechnology). Live transfected HeLa cells were also examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy in standard medium at 24 h post transfection. Conventional fluorescence analysis was performed using the Leica DMLB (Deerfield, IL) microscope. Images were recorded with a cooled Sensiocam charge-coupled device camera. For confocal laser scanning microscopy, an LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss) with a 100×/1.3 objective and an argon laser (488 nm) was used. Images were processed using the Axiovision (Carl Zeiss) and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA) programs. Peptide Substitution Analysis of the CD2BP2 Target Sequence, SHRPPPPGHRV—To delineate the contribution of individual residues of the peptide SHRPPPPGHRV to the interaction with the CD2BP2-GYF domain, a substitution analysis of this peptide was performed (Fig. 2). Individual peptides were synthesized on a cellulose membrane. Spot intensity qualitatively correlates with peptide binding affinities (17Kramer A. Reineke U. Dong L. Hoffmann B. Hoffmuller U. Winkler D. Volkmer-Engert R. Schneider-Mergener J. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and allows the detection of interactions with KD values that are in the high μm range. Fig. 2 shows a strong requirement for proline at positions 6 and 7, whereas proline at position 4 and 5 can be substituted by most other amino acids. This finding correlates well with the numerous van der Waals interactions observed between prolines 6 and 7 and the aromatic side chains of the domain in the complex (Fig. 1). At position 8, glycine results in the strongest signal; however, several other amino acids are allowed at this position. Surprisingly, a tryptophan instead of glycine at position 8 is tolerated. Because the bulky tryptophan side chain would clash sterically with GYF domain residues 8 and 15 if it were bound in the same conformation as the wild type peptide, it is likely that an alternate mode of binding exists for this peptide. At position 10 only positively charged amino acids are allowed, whereas position 3 also tolerates a substitution to glycine. The contribution of positively charged amino acids to peptide binding affinity supports the notion of charge complementarity conferring specificity to complex formation (Fig. 1). The remaining positions of the CD2 peptide are indifferent to most substitutions, except for aspartate and glutamate, which are disfavored. In general, the substitution analysis can be rationalized by the structure of the CD2BP2-GYF domain in complex with the CD2 peptide (11Freund C. Kühne R. Yang H.L. Park S. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5985-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and allows us to define the motif (R/K/G)XXPPGX(R/K) as the ligand core motif for the CD2BP2-GYF domain. Sequence Motifs from SmB/B′ Bind to the GYF Domain of CD2BP2 in Vitro—We tested natural sequences that are known ligands for other proline-rich sequence recognition domains for their interaction with CD2BP2-GYF. A diverse set of sequences representing binding sites for the SH3, WW, and EVH1 domains was examined by peptide spot analysis. Only a few peptides resulted in detectable spot intensities (Fig. 3B and Table I). For comparison, CD2-derived peptides from Homo sapiens and homologues from other species were included on the cellulose membrane (Fig. 3A and Table I). Aside from the CD2 sequences, the sequence with the highest spot intensity arises from the SmB core splicing protein (position 20 in Fig. 3B). SmB and the alternative splicing product SmB′ contain two and three motifs, respectively, that exactly match the suggested binding motif, (R/K/G)XXPPGX(R/K). To gain a more detailed insight into the interaction of these peptides with the CD2BP2-GYF domain, we performed NMR shift mapping experiments. Increasing amounts of the SmB-derived peptides, PMGRGAPPPGMMGPPPGMRPPM (SmB-1, data not shown) and GTPMGMPPPGMRPPPPGMRGLL (SmB-2), or the previously characterized control peptide, SHRPPPPGHRV (CD2 peptide) (11Freund C. Kühne R. Yang H.L. Park S. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5985-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), were added to the 15N-labeled CD2BP2-GYF domain, and 15N-1H correlation spectra were recorded. In Fig. 4A, an overlay of the spectra of the isolated CD2BP2-GYF domain and the CD2BP2-GYF domain in the presence of equimolar amounts of either SmB-2 or CD2 peptides is shown. The observed chemical shift changes are indicative of amino acid NH groups that are close in space to the ligand. Both peptides display a similar pattern of resonance shifts within the spectrum (Fig. 4A); however, the extent of the chemical shift changes at a given peptide concentration is larger for SmB-2 in comparison with the CD2 peptide (Fig. 4A, inset). Because SmB-2 contains two intercalated consensus motifs (GMPPPGMRPPPPGMR), it is very likely that the presence of two motifs in SmB-2 increases the apparent affinity by enhancing the local concentration of interaction sites. Residues displaying significant chemical shift changes are highlighted on the surface of the CD2BP2-GYF domain (Fig. 4B). These residues define a contiguous area with side chains of the bulge-helix-bulge motif and Trp-8 forming a hydrophobic patch. The surface defined by the NMR chemical shift data is very similar for the two peptides, confirming that the peptide motifs within SmB-2 bind to the GYF domain in an orientation and conformation analogous to those of the CD2 peptide (Fig. 4B). The binding mode and apparent affinity for the SmB-1 peptide are very similar to those of the SmB-2 peptide (data not shown).Table IBinding of CD2BP2-GYF to sequences derived from CD2 of different species and from different classes of ligands for proline-rich binding domainsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Binding analysis of SmB-2 to the CD2BP2-GYF domain by NMR.A, overlap of the 15N-1H correlation spectra of the isolated GYF domain (green) and the GYF domain upon equimolar addition of the CD2 peptide (blue) or SmB-2 peptide (red). The 11 NH resonances with the largest chemical shift difference between the bound and unbound state are labeled according to residue type and number. The NH cross-peak of Phe-34 broadens upon ligand binding and is too weak to be followed in these spectra. The asterisks at Trp-8 and Trp-28 indicate side chain NH resonances, whereas all other labeled resonances are backbone NH resonances. The inset shows the sum of chemical shift changes for all assigned peaks of the CD2BP2-GYF domain as a function of the ligand concentration of either the CD2 peptide (blue) or the SmB-2 peptide (red). B, binding site of SmB-2 peptide and CD2 peptide on the CD2BP2-GYF domain as derived from the NMR titration. The binding sites for CD2 (left) and SmB-2 (right) are derived from the NMR titration experiment and mapped onto the surface of the CD2BP2-GYF. The residues with the 11 strongest chemical shift changes are colored dark green, and an additional 11 residues with significant chemical shift changes are depicted in light green. Trp-8 and Trp-28 have been classified according to the chemical shift change of their side chain NH group. Residues Pro-19 and Pro-35 of the CD2BP2-GYF domain, which could not be observed in the 15N-1H correlation experiment, have also been included in the binding surface and are colored in dark green, since both proline residues are flanked by residues that show a significant chemical shift change upon binding. The CD2 peptide is depicted as a bonded structure. The surface representations of the CD2BP2-GYF domain were created in Sybyl (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) SmB/B′ Is a Specific Binding Partner of the CD2BP2-GYF Domain in Vivo—GST pulldown experiments were undertaken to establish that the interaction between CD2BP2-GYF and SmB/B′ occurs under physiological conditions. It is shown in Fig. 5A that SmB/B′ could be specifically captured from a Jurkat cell lysate with GST-GYF in contrast to GST alone or the unrelated GST-hSH3 fusion construct, which has been shown not to bind to proline-rich sequences (18Heuer K. Kofler M. Langdon G. Thiemke K. Freund C. Structure. 2004; 12: 603-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this interaction could be effectively competed out by the addition of an excess of SmB-2 peptide to the cell lysate, whereas the interaction remained unperturbed by the presence of an unrelated peptide (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 3 and 4). These results demonstrate that a physiologically relevant interaction occurs between the COOH-terminal proline-rich sequences of the SmB/B′ protein and the GYF domain of CD2BP2. Colocalization of CD2BP2 and SmB/B′—Transient expression of EGFP-tagged full-length CD2BP2 and EYFP-SmB fusion proteins in Jurkat and HeLa cells was used to determine their intracellular localization. The proteins localized predominantly to the nucleus with a residual cytoplasmic pool 24 h after transfection, as verified by Hoechst staining of DNA (Fig. 6, A and B). Co-transfection of EGFP-CD2BP2 and EYFP-SmB in HeLa cells showed considerable colocalization of the two proteins in the nucleus in live cell laser scanning microscopy imaging studies (Fig. 6C). Both CD2BP2 and SmB/B′ were excluded from nucleoli (Fig. 6C). Interaction of CD2BP2-GYF with Other Splicing Factors— The identified interaction of the CD2BP2-GYF domain with a proline-rich region of SmB/B′ raised the question of whether proline-rich sequences of other splicing factors that resemble the binding motif (R/K/G)XXPPGX(R/K) are also able to bind to CD2BP2-GYF. Sequences of splicing proteins containing the reduced core motif PPG were analyzed by spot synthesis (Fig. 7 and supplemental material). Peptides derived from SmB/B′ or SmB-like proteins such as SNRPB protein (a variant of SmB), Sm-D, and RT-LI (a snRNP with a novel exon 3) contain motifs that match the binding motif (R/K/G)XXPPGX(R/K) (Fig. 7, spots 17, 27, 28, 31–33, 36–38). In addition to these peptides, sequence motifs from the proline- and glutamine-rich splicing factor (Fig. 7, position 9) and splicing factor 1 isoform (Fig. 7, position 18) showed binding comparable with the human CD2 peptide (position 1). In summary, the abundance of proline-rich sequences within spliceosomal proteins that bind to the CD2BP2-GYF domain sets the stage for further investigations of GYF domain-mediated protein-protein interactions within the spliceosomal complexes. Sequence recognition by the CD2BP2-GYF domain is not restricted to motifs that precisely match the previously described PPPPGHR motifs in CD2 (6Nishizawa K. Freund C. Li J. Wagner G. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14897-14902Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our peptide analysis shows that the CD2BP2-GYF domain requires two adjacent prolines in the ligand to contact the hydrophobic hot spot of the domain (Fig. 2). A glycine at the position directly COOH-terminal to the second proline (position 8 in the CD2 peptide) is favorable, and positively charged residues flanking the PPII helix are important for high affinity binding. Peptide spot analysis of diverse sequences that obey the sequence requirements confirmed that this subset of proline-rich sequences binds to the CD2BP2-GYF domain in vitro. Interestingly, the interacting peptides and putative target sites are found in several splicing proteins. The most strongly interacting sequences belong to the SmB/B′ core splicing protein, which contains several binding motifs within its COOH-terminal tail. Our experiments with EGFP-tagged CD2BP2 showed a localization of CD2BP2 primarily to the nucleus, possibly due to the presence of a putative bipartite nuclear localization sequence at the NH2 terminus of the CD2BP2 protein. Nuclear localization of CD2BP2 and SmB/B′ is in agreement with a direct interaction. The finding that CD2BP2 is stably associated with the pre-spliceosome (21Hartmuth K. Urlaub H. Vornlocher H.P. Will C.L. Gentzel M. Wilm M. Lührmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16719-16724Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) supports this notion; however, since CD2BP2 has not been found in snRNPs other than U2, regulatory mechanisms might determine the temporal and spatial interaction of SmB/B′ with CD2BP2. Interestingly, the prolinerich sequences from SmB/B′ identified as binding to CD2BP2-GYF in this study were shown to be target sites for WW and SH3 domains of several proteins in vitro (22Bedford M.T. Reed R. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 23Espejo A. Cote J. Bednarek A. Richard S. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but in most cases it is not known whether the corresponding proteins are physiological interaction partners of SmB/B′. However in mouse, the WW domain of the FBP21 protein was shown to bind directly to the PPPGMR motifs in SmB/B′ and to colocalize with spliceosomal proteins in nuclear speckles (22Bedford M.T. Reed R. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Since we show binding of CD2BP2 to (R/K/G)XXPPGX(R/K) containing sequences of SmB/B′ in this study, simultaneous and/or competitive binding of FBP21 and CD2BP2 to SmB/B′ might occur. Assuming that the interaction of SmB/B′ with FBP21 is characterized by a high off-rate similar to the interaction of SmB/B′ with CD2BP2, competitive binding of CD2BP2 and FBP21 to SmB/B′ as a regulatory mechanism would require large relative differences in protein concentration within the specific cell compartment. In contrast, the colocalization of the two proteins with the SmB/B′ tail is likely to occur under conditions in which the concentrations of the interacting proteins and the KD values of the interactions are in the same order of magnitude. The latter scenario would support the hypothesis that the proline-rich sequences of SmB/B′ mediate transient interactions that aid in the formation of more stable protein assemblies during the complex biogenesis of the snRNPs. The moderate specificity and affinity of proline-rich sequence recognition by CD2BP2 might reflect the dynamic nature of molecular associations during spliceosomal protein assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2131498455,"The modulation of N-type calcium channels is a key factor in the control of neurotransmitter release. Whereas N-type channels are inhibited by Gβγ subunits in a G protein β-isoform-dependent manner, channel activity is typically stimulated by activation of protein kinase C (PKC). In addition, there is cross-talk among these pathways, such that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the Gβγ target site on the N-type channel antagonizes subsequent G protein inhibition, albeit only for Gβ1-mediated responses. The molecular mechanisms that control this G protein β subunit subtype-specific regulation have not been described. Here, we show that G protein inhibition of N-type calcium channels is critically dependent on two separate but adjacent ∼20-amino acid regions of the Gβ subunit, plus a highly conserved Asn-Tyr-Val motif. These regions are distinct from those implicated previously in Gβγ signaling to other effectors such as G protein-coupled inward rectifier potassium channels, phospholipase β2, and adenylyl cyclase, thus raising the possibility that the specificity for G protein signaling to calcium channels might rely on unique G protein structural determinants. In addition, we identify a highly specific locus on the Gβ1 subunit that serves as a molecular detector of PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the G protein target site on the N-type channel α1 subunit, thus providing for a molecular basis for G protein-PKC cross-talk.

Overall, our results significantly advance our understanding of the molecular details underlying the integration of G protein and PKC signaling pathways at the level of the N-type calcium channel α1 subunit. The modulation of calcium channels at presynaptic nerve terminals is a key factor in regulating synaptic efficacy (1Wheeler G.B. Randall A. Tsien R.W. Science. 1994; 264: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 2Dunlap K. Luebke J.I. Turnerm T.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 89-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). It is now well established that the activation of G protein-coupled receptors inhibits presynaptic calcium channel activity and thus neurotransmitter release (3Zamponi G.W. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 34: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). G protein inhibition of both N-type and P/Q-type calcium channels appears to be exclusively mediated by the G protein βγ subunit (4Ikeda S.R.

Nature. 1996; 280: 258-262Crossref Scopus (693) Google Scholar), with the Gβ subunit being the main determinant of calcium channel inhibition. Putative G protein βγ subunit interaction sites have been identified within the intracellular loop linking domains I and II of the calcium channel α1 subunit (6DeWaard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 7Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P.

A. 1997; 94: 8866-8871Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To date, five different types of G protein β subunits have been identified and shown to mediate varying effects on native and transiently expressed N-type calcium channels (10Garcia D.E. Li B.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, N-type and P/Q-type calcium channels appear to be differentially modulated by different types of G protein β subunits (12Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), thus providing for a mechanism by which different G protein-coupled receptors may selectively regulate individual presynaptic calcium channel subtypes. In contrast, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; GIRK, G protein-coupled inward rectifier potassium; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PP, prepulse; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; ANOVA, analysis of variance.1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; GIRK, G protein-coupled inward rectifier potassium; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PP, prepulse; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; ANOVA, analysis of variance. results in an up-regulation of N-type channel activity (13Stea A.

Physiol. 2000; 115: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There is a complex interplay between PKC and G protein pathways such that activation of PKC antagonizes subsequent receptor-mediated G protein inhibition of presynaptic calcium channels (15Swartz K.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 305-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 16Swartz K.J. Merrit A. Bean B.P. Lovinger D.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This effect is mediated via PKC-dependent phosphorylation of a single threonine residue located in the G protein interaction site within the domain I-II linker region of the N-type calcium channel α1 subunit (17Hamid J. Nelson D. Spaetgens R. Dubel S.J. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 278: 6195-6202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (111) Google Scholar), thus allowing the channel protein to integrate multiple modulatory inputs. Interestingly, this cross-talk between G protein and PKC pathways appears to be a selective feature of the G protein β1 subunit, thus allowing PKC to selectively antagonize G protein inhibition mediated by a subset of (i.e. predominantly Gβ1-coupled) receptors (18Cooper C.B. Arnot M.I. Feng Z.P. Jarvis S.E. Hamid J. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40777-40781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, although calcium channel structural determinants of G protein regulation and PKC cross-talk have received considerable attention (3Zamponi G.W. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 34: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), there is relatively scant information that concerns the G protein structural determinants that underlie N-type channel regulation and PKC-G protein cross-talk. Alanine mutagenesis of Gβ residues known to interact with Gα disrupts Gβ coupling to a series of downstream effectors, including calcium channels, adenylyl cyclase, GIRK channels, and phospholipase β2 (19Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E.

This suggests that there may be partial overlap in the G protein β subunit structural determinants that control the functional interactions both within the heterotrimeric G protein complex and with downstream signaling targets. Ford et al. (19Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) identified six amino acid residues (Lys-78, Met-101, Asn-119, Thr-143, Asp-186, and Trp-332) on the Gβ1 subunit that, when mutated to alanine, reduced the ability of Gβ1 to inhibit N-type calcium channels. In addition, mutagenesis of two residues (Leu-55 and Ile-80) resulted in an increased ability to regulate N-type channels. However, these residues are completely conserved across all types of G protein β subunit subtypes, which implies that they cannot account for the differential effects of different types of Gβ subunits on calcium channel activity. Hence, additional Gβ structural determinants control G protein modulation of N-type channels. Here, we utilized chimeric and mutant G protein β subunits to systematically identify G protein structural determinants that control their action on N-type channels. We identify a hot spot of amino acid sequences in the Gβ1 subunit that is essential for N-type channel modulation. In addition, we localize cross-talk behavior to a single locus on the Gβ1 subunit, thus identifying a molecular switch that allows the G proteins to detect a phosphorylated N-type calcium channel. In this context, our data close a major gap in our understanding of the complex interplay between G protein and PKC regulation of presynaptic calcium channel activity. cDNAs—The cDNAs encoding human Gβ1 and Gγ2, rat Gβ5, and EGFP-tagged Gβ1 and Gβ5 subunits were described by us previously (12Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Feng Z.P. Arnot M.I. Doering C.J. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45051-45058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Wild type rat calcium channel subunits were donated by Terry Snutch (University of British Columbia), and the T422E mutant N-type channel was described previously (17Hamid J. Nelson D. Spaetgens R. Dubel S.J. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 278: 6195-6202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Chimeric Constructs—Chimeras were created in two steps. For an initial round of chimeras, MluI, ApaLI, and EagI sites were inserted into both Gβ1 and Gβ5 encoding cDNAs at exactly complimentary positions, using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In each case, the entire coding region was sequenced after mutagenesis. Together with the 5′ and 3′ cloning sites (KpnI and XhoI, respectively) and the presence of additional ApaLI and EagI sites in the pMT2 vector sequence, this allowed the swapping of four different regions (i.e. residues 1-47, 48-168, 168-280, and 280-340; numbering according to Gβ1 sequence; see Fig. 1A) between Gβ1 and Gβ5 through cutting and ligating. Successful creation of the chimeras was confirmed via sequencing. Note that positions 47, 168, 280, and 340 in Gβ1 correspond to positions 54, 179, 294, and 353 in Gβ5. A second round of chimeras was created via PCR, using wild type Gβ subunits and the initial set of chimeras as templates. Briefly, sense and antisense oligonucleotides, spanning the junctions of the new chimeras, were synthesized. Subsequently, these were used to amplify (with vector upstream and downstream primers) each end of the new chimera, using the appropriate clone as a template. Overlaps included in the junction spanning oligonucleotides allowed the two fragments to anneal at those points. The two fragments were gel-isolated, combined in equimolar concentrations, and subjected to another round of high fidelity PCR, with only the upstream and downstream primers included in the reaction mix. Proofstart DNA polymerase (Qiagen) was used for all PCRs. Purified, full-length PCR products were isolated after restriction digestion and cloned in the appropriate vector. All of the fragments generated by PCR were sequenced after cloning to ensure that no PCR-induced errors were incorporated into the final clones. Point Mutations in Gβ1 and Gβ3—Point mutations in both Gβ1 and Gβ3 were also created using the QuikChange™ kit as described above. The presence of the mutations and the absence of mutagenesis errors were determined via DNA sequencing. EGFP-tagged Constructs—N-terminal fluorescently tagged chimeric Gβ proteins were created using Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) Living Colors™ C-terminal EGFP vectors. Briefly, chimeric G protein β subunits were excised from the pMT2-XS vector using previously engineered restriction sites (XhoI and KpnI found in the 5′ and 3′ regions, respectively) (12Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and subcloned in-frame into the EGFP vectors. Correct insertion within the EGFP vector was confirmed with both restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. Tissue Culture and Transient Transfection of tsA-201 Cells—Human embryonic kidney tsA-201 cells were grown and transfected with calcium phosphate as described by us previously in detail (21Feng Z.P. Arnot M.I. Doering C.J. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45051-45058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In each experiment involving calcium channels, wild type or mutant rat Cav2.2 calcium channel α1 subunits were cotransfected with rat β1b, rat α2-δ1, Gγ2, and an EGFP expression marker (except in the case where EGFP-tagged G proteins were used), plus one of wild type or chimeric Gβ subunits. For experiments involving GIRK channels, GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits were used instead of calcium channel subunits. To prevent cells from overgrowing, the cells are routinely placed in a 28 °C incubator 12 h after transfection. Under these conditions, tsA-201 cells change their morphology such that they appear rounded (see Fig. 1C, inset). Patch Clamp Recordings and Data Analysis—Glass coverslips carrying transfected cells were transferred to a 3-cm culture dish containing recording solution comprised of 20 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 10 mm glucose, 65 mm CsCl (pH 7.2 with tetraethylammonium-hydroxide). Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) linked to a personal computer equipped with pCLAMP version 6.0, 8.0, or 9.0. Patch pipettes (Sutter borosilicate glass, BF150-86-15) were pulled using a Sutter P-87 microelectrode puller, fire-polished, and showed typical resistances of 3-4 mΩ. The internal pipette solution contained 108 mm cesium methane-sulfonate, 4 mm MgCl2, 9 mm EGTA, 9 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Series resistance was compensated by 80-85%. Leak currents were negligible. The data were filtered at 1 kHz and recorded directly onto the hard drive of the computer. Unless stated otherwise, the currents were evoked by stepping from -100 mV to a test potential of +20 mV. G protein inhibition was assessed by application of a strong depolarizing (+150 mV) prepulse (PP) for 50 ms. Typically, only cells with current amplitudes greater than 50 pA were used for analysis. The degree of prepulse relief of tonic G protein inhibition was determined as the ratio of peak current amplitudes seen after (I+PP) and before (I-PP) the prepulse and reflects the ability of a given G protein β subunit to inhibit N-type current activity. The PP paradigms were programmed using the “train” and “user list” functions in pCLAMP. For experiments involving activation of protein kinase C, PMA (Sigma) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a 1 mm stock concentration and diluted into the recording solution at a final concentration of 30 nm. Control solution or solution containing PMA was perfused onto cells via a home-built gravity-driven microperfusion system. For recordings involving GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits, whole cell recordings were conducted using an internal solution of 100 mm potassium gluconate, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA 5, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm NaCl (pH 7.4 with KOH). The external solution contained 25 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, and 116 mm NaCl (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Under these conditions, the predicted reversal potential for potassium is approximately -30 mV. GIRK channel activity was assessed by holding the cells at -35 mV, followed by an application of a voltage ramp from -120 to +60 mV over 525 ms. Only cells displaying inward rectification were used for analysis, and whole cell GIRK conductance was obtained by a linear fit to the inward current. Whole cell capacitance ranged from 5 to 40 pF. In this range, there was no correlation between capacitance and whole cell conductance (r2 = 0.15; not shown), and hence, the data are plotted in Fig. 4 as whole cell conductance rather than current densities. For each batch of transfected cells, we determined the GIRK activity in the absence of Gβ subunits. All of the data were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments) and fitted in Sigmaplot 4.0 (Jandel Scientific). Statistical analysis was carried out in SigmaStat via t tests, or as appropriate via ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey test or, for GIRK experiments, ANOVA on the ranks (Dunn method). Confocal Microscopy—Imaging was carried out at the Seaman Family MR Research Center Confocal Microscopy and Imaging Facility. Briefly, tsA-201 cells were transfected with DNA encoding the N-type calcium channel (Cav2.2 α1, α2-δ1, and β1b), Gγ2, and EGFP-tagged G protein β subunits. Initially coverslips containing cells of interest were placed in a glass-bottomed Petri dish and visualized with an inverted IX70 Olympus microscope. Confocal images were created using an Olympus Fluoview confocal laser scanning microscope (confocal aperture 2). The cells were stimulated with an argon 488-nm laser. Settings were chosen for laser power, photon multiplier tube gain, and offset so that pixel densities were just below saturation levels. Transmitted image visualization was conducted with Nomarski differential interference contrast microscopy (21Feng Z.P. Arnot M.I. Doering C.J. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45051-45058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Determinants of N-type Channel Inhibition by Gβ1 Subunits—We have shown previously that rat N-type calcium channels are potently inhibited by Gβ1 subunits, whereas Gβ5 subunits have no significant effect on current activity (Ref. 12Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 1C). To determine key G protein β subunit structural determinants that control calcium channel inhibition, the differential Gβ1/Gβ5 effects were used as the basis for a chimeric approach. Initially the Gβ1 and Gβ5 subunits were each divided into four complimentary regions that were exchanged in various combinations (see Fig. 1A for example). The chimeric constructs were coexpressed with N-type (Cav2.2 + β1b + α2-δ1) calcium channels, the Gγ2 subunit, and an EGFP selection marker, and tonic G protein inhibition was assessed by application of strong depolarizing PP as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 1B, Gβ1 mediates a robust tonic inhibition as reflected by a large increase in current amplitude following the PP. Replacement of the first 47 residues or the last 60 residues of Gβ1 with Gβ5, individually or in combination, preserved the ability of Gβ1 to inhibit N-type channels, despite the fact that Gβ1 and Gβ5 share only 30 and 60% sequence identity in these two regions, respectively. In contrast, as illustrated in Fig. 1C, replacement of either residues 47-168 or residues 168-280 with corresponding Gβ5 sequence, alone or in combination with other substitutions, reduced the degree of prepulse relief to that seen in the presence of wild type Gβ5 (note that prepulse relief observed with Gβ5 does not differ significantly from conditions where no G proteins are coexpressed). To minimize the possibility that the lack of modulation might be due to the lack of expression or due to inappropriate targeting of the Gβ subunit chimeras, we generated N-terminally EGFP-tagged versions of the wild type and key chimeric G proteins and analyzed their subcellular distribution via fluorescence confocal microscopy. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1C, the wild type and chimeric G protein subunits were detected in the plasma membrane, suggesting that they are indeed properly expressed and targeted in tsA-201 cells. Moreover, the observation that all of the Gβ constructs display robust plasma localization implies that the observed effects are not secondarily due to an inability of certain chimeras to assemble into Gβγ dimers. In addition, we have shown previously via Western blot and kinetic analyses that transient transfection of wild type G protein results in saturating levels of Gβ which, in turn, leads to a homogenous population of G protein bound N-type calcium channels (21Feng Z.P. Arnot M.I. Doering C.J. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45051-45058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the failure to observe G protein inhibition with certain chimeras was not simply due to a lack of expression/targeting. Overall, our data obtained with the initial set of chimeras suggest that although the N- and C-terminal regions of Gβ are not critical determinants of G protein inhibition of N-type channels, one or more regions between residues 47 and 280 are essential for G protein inhibition. To further elucidate the G protein β subunit structural determinants of N-type channel modulation, we created additional chimeras with sequence substitutions in regions 47-168 and 168-280. As shown in Fig. 2, replacing Gβ1 residues 47-116 or 116-168 with corresponding Gβ5 sequence resulted in the loss of G protein inhibition. Substitutions of smaller fragments within these two regions revealed that replacement of regions 47-75, 75-100, and 116-140 did not block the ability of Gβ1 to inhibit N-type channel activity. On the contrary, the 47-75 construct displayed a dramatically enhanced ability to inhibit N-type channel activity. In contrast, substitution of residues 140-168 or replacement of an Asn-110, Tyr-111, and Val-112 motif (that is highly conserved in all G protein β subunits with the exception of Gβ5) with Gβ5 (i.e. Cys-Ala-Ile) sequence eliminated the ability of Gβ1 to inhibit N-type calcium channels. A similar analysis for residues 168-280 is shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), substitution of residues 204-248, 248-280, and 168-186 maintained the ability of Gβ1 to inhibit N-type calcium channels, whereas substitution of residues 186-204 abolished Gβ1 modulation. Taken together, there appear to be at least three separate regions that are responsible for the differential effect of Gβ1 and Gβ5 on N-type calcium channel activity. It is unlikely that these effects would have arisen from a global disruption of Gβ1 subunit folding because of the presence of Gβ5 sequence, because Gβ1 activity was retained for a majority of the Gβ5 substitutions that were created (i.e. 1-47, 47-75, 75-100, 116-140, 168-186, 204-248, and 248-280). To ensure that the effects of the chimeras were specific rather than caused by inappropriate folding, we first attempted to create a gain of function chimera in which regions in Gβ5 were concomitantly replaced with corresponding Gβ1 residues 110-112, 140-168, and 186-204. However, the Gβ5(110-112, 140-168, 186-204) chimera did not result in significant G protein inhibition (I+PP/I-PP = 1.11 ± 0.03, n = 22). This suggests that gain of function may require additional residues outside of the three identified regions, which will be subject to further investigation. As an additional approach, we created two point mutations in which residues 111 and 153 of Gβ1 were replaced with corresponding Gβ5 residues. These residues are located within the 110-112 and 140-168 stretches were chosen based on the surface exposure on the Gβ1 crystal structure (see Fig. 5B below). Substitution of Tyr-111 with alanine resulted in a dramatic reduction of the degree of prepulse relief (I+PP/I-PP)to 1.48 ± 0.19 (n = 15), and replacement of Asp-153 to asparagine resulted in an even stronger reduction of prepulse relief to 1.37 ± 0.08 (n = 15). These data suggest that even single amino acid substitutions in at least two of the identified regions are sufficient to drastically attenuate the ability of Gβ1 to inhibit N-type calcium channels, consistent with the idea that the inability of the chimeras to regulate channel activity did not arise secondarily from global structural changes.Fig. 3Chimeric analysis of residues 168-280 in the G protein β1 subunit. A, current records obtained from tsA-201 cells expressing the N-type calcium channel, Gγ2, and G protein β subunit chimeras 168-204 (top panel), 204-248 (middle panel), and 248-280 (bottom panel).

GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits were coexpressed in tsA-201 cells with either wild type or chimeric/mutant Gβ subunits, and the whole cell GIRK conductance was determined via whole call patch clamp recordings using a voltage ramp protocol. Rather than examining the entire set of chimeras, we focused on the key chimeras and mutants that most narrowly defined the regions involved in N-type channel modulation, i.e. Gβ1(100-112), Gβ1(140-168), Gβ1(186-204), Gβ1(Y111A), Gβ1(D153N), and the Gβ5(110-112, 140-168, 186-204) chimera. As shown in Fig. 4, expression of GIRK1/4 in the absence of exogenous Gβ subunits resulted in some background GIRK activity, consistent with previous work in Xenopus oocytes (22Mirshahi T.

Cotransfection of Gβ1 subunits resulted in a significant increase in whole cell conductance by ∼300%. Interestingly and in contrast with a previous study (22Mirshahi T. Robillard L. Zhang H.

During transport, much of this cholesterol is carried in esterified form in the hydrophobic core of HDL particles (7Francone O.L. Guraker A. Fielding C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7066-7072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfer of cholesteryl esters (CEs) and cholesterol from HDL to liver parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) occurs by selective removal of core lipids with the primary HDL particle (phospholipid, free cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I), returning to the circulation undegraded, the process commonly called selective uptake (8Glass C.

A microsomal cholesterol esterase that is biochemically distinct from other esterases has been purified from hepatocytes, but its location on the lumenal face of rough endoplasmic reticulum is not consistent with a role in HDL CE hydrolysis (27Fresnedo O.

A role for CEL in HDL metabolism was suggested by studies that showed increased selective uptake of cholesteryl ether by HepG2 cells when CEL was added to the medium (43Li F. Huang Y. Hui D.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6657-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, cell fractionation studies showed the presence of CEL in a retrosome fraction prepared from rat liver endosomes (44Hornick C.A. Hui D.Y. DeLamatre J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1075-C1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The purpose of the current study was to test the hypothesis that CEL affects selective uptake by the SR BI pathway and contributes to hydrolysis of HDL-derived cholesteryl esters. Using multiple approaches CEL is shown to colocalize with SR BI in lipid rafts and to enhance selective uptake of HDL CE by the SR BI pathway. Results also show decreased hydrolysis of HDL CE in CEL knockout mice and in cultured hepatocytes lacking CEL activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHDL Isolation and Radiolabeling—HDL3 (1.125 < ρ < 1.21) was isolated from recently expired human plasma obtained from the local blood bank (Hoxworth Blood Center, Cincinnati, OH) by standard methods of sequential centrifugation using KBr to adjust solution density (45Havel R.G.

If necessary, the HDL fraction was concentrated using Aquacide II (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) for several hours and re-dialyzed. Radiolabeled lipids were added to HDL according to the potato starch method described by Glass et al. (8Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 mg of HDL (protein mass) was lyophilized onto 25 mg of potato starch (Sigma-Aldrich) in a siliconized glass tube. This mixture was vortexed thoroughly, chilled in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and lyophilized until the starch was powder-dry. [3H]Cholesteryl oleoyl ether or ester (2-3 μCi/mg of HDL protein, 30-60 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was added to the dry HDL/starch mixture in 500 μl of heptane and vortexed thoroughly. The sample was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with periodic vortexing. The heptane was evaporated under nitrogen, and the HDL was solubilized in 1 ml of PBS. The HDL/starch mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C with gentle agitation, after which the starch was pelletted along with the unincorporated label, and the supernatant containing the reconstituted HDL was removed. This supernatant was filtered through a 1.0-μm syringe filter, and the specific activity was determined. In one experiment (experiment 1, Table I) HDL3 was labeled by cholesteryl ester transfer protein-mediated transfer of radio-labeled cholesteryl oleate from donor liposomes followed by reisolation of the HDL, as described (22Pittman R.C. Knecht T.P. Rosenbaum M.S. Taylor C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration of isolated HDL was determined by the modified Lowry method of Markwell et al. (46Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tabert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5290) Google Scholar). Cholesterol was determined by enzymatic methods using kits from Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA). When warranted (by agarose gel analysis) HDL was repurified by isopycnic centrifugation in KBr as above or in self-forming gradients of iodixanol/PBS exactly as described (47Sawle A. Higgins M.K.

In a typical reaction 100 μg of protein was reacted with 1.0 mCi of Na125I. Protein was separated from unincorporated 125I with a 1.0-ml Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) column followed by extensive dialysis against PBS to remove residual free iodine. Protein was determined by the Lowry method (48Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Cell Culture Selective Uptake Assays—The culture conditions used for the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, were those of Li et al. (43Li F. Huang Y. Hui D.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6657-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For selective uptake experiments cells were plated on 60-mm plates, and experiments were performed 5-7 days after plating, when the cells reached confluence. On the day of the experiment, fresh medium containing 0.1-2 mm taurocholate (concentration varied with experiment according to each figure) or 0.5 mm taurodeoxycholate and the radiolabeled HDL (2-5 × 105 dpm/dish) was added to the cells, and incubation was carried out for 4 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 125I-labeled CEL. Plates were then washed 2 times with fresh medium and incubated with serum-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C. After removing the “chase” medium plates were chilled on ice, and 1 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) was added to each. Cells were removed by scraping and disrupted with several strokes of a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. The cell homogenate was overlaid onto a preformed density gradient of 10-26% iodixanol (OptiPrep™, Sigma). The gradient was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW40 rotor, and 1-ml fractions were harvested from the top by pipette and stored at -80 °C until analyzed. The protein content of the fractions was determined using the MicroBCA™ protein assay reagent kit from Pierce. Appropriate concentrations of iodixanol were included in standard curves and blanks to correct for its slight interference with the assay.When investigating the possible involvement of cell surface proteoglycans in the selective uptake process, the HepG2 cells were pretreated for 3 h at 37 °C in medium containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum with or without heparin at 100 μg/ml, a concentration that specifically blocks interactions with heparin-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (49Fuki I.V.

After 3 h, 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum medium containing 0.2 mm taurocholate and HDL [3H]CE was added to the cells with or without CEL (30 μg/ml). The incubation, wash, and fractionation of the cells were performed as described above. The lipid raft fractions for each experimental group were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) to determine the total cholesterol incorporated from the HDL [3H]CE during selective uptake.Western Blot Analysis—The proteins in equal volumes of density gradient fractions from HepG2 or mouse liver cell homogenates were separated by electrophoresis through an 8% polyacrylamide, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate gel, and the resolved proteins were electroblotted onto nylon-supported nitrocellulose (Osmonics, Westborough, MA). After transfer, SR BI protein was detected with a specific primary antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and the ECF Western blotting Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Chemifluorescence was measured with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).TLC of Lipids—Lipids were isolated from gradient fractions by extracting 2 times with 2 volumes of chloroform:methanol (2:1). The solvents were evaporated by a nitrogen stream, and the lipids were dissolved in 30 μl of chloroform and then spotted onto silica gel G TLC plates that were pre-dried for 30 min at 80 °C. Cholesterol and cholesteryl ester standards were loaded separately on the same plate. Lipids were resolved with a mobile phase of petroleum ether:ethyl ether:acetic acid (300:60:1). Lipids were visualized with iodine vapor, and free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters were scraped from the plate and quantitated by scintillation spectrometry.Immunohistochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—For immunohistochemistry, HepG2 cells were grown on gelatin-coated (1%) glass cover slips in 60-mm culture dishes. All other growth conditions were the same as described above. Immunostaining was done 3 days after plating or when cells were ∼60% confluent. At this time 30 μg/ml CEL was added to the cells exogenously in 2 ml of fresh medium, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The medium was then removed, and the cells were rinsed with PBS to remove unbound CEL. Cells were fixed by sequential treatment with 5% formalin in PBS, 5% formalin, 10% methanol in PBS, and 30% methanol in PBS for 1 min each and were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Antibody stocks were centrifuged for 30 min at 150,000 × g in a Beckman Airfuge to remove aggregates and reduce background before being diluted with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for use. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:500, and all other reagents were diluted 1:100 as recommended by the suppliers. All incubations were for 30 min at room temperature and were followed by one brief and two 5-min PBS washes. Because both primary antibodies were raised in rabbits, specific reagents from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA) that were pre-selected by the manufacturer for the absence of cross-reactivity were used. Cells were first incubated with the CEL-specific antibody (43Li F. Huang Y. Hui D.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6657-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) followed by the Fab fragment of a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and then Texas Red-conjugated mouse anti-goat IgG antibody. Cells were next incubated with the SR BI-specific antibody (Novus Biologicals) and, finally, with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The coverslip was inverted, cell side down, onto a minimum amount of ProLong® antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) placed on a clean glass slide. Cells were examined by light and confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS 4D microscope/SCANware system (Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with an Omnichrome krypton-argon laser (Chino, CA). Excitation was performed with the 488- and 568-nm argon/krypton laser lines simultaneously. Emission was detected using an RSP580 beam splitter and BP530 filter at detector 1 for fluorescein and an LP590 filter at detector 2 for Texas Red.Isolation of Membrane Fractions from Mouse Liver—Mice were sacrificed by anesthetic overdose, and their livers were immediately flushed with cold PBS. All procedures were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. Livers were then homogenized in 5 volumes of homogenization buffer as described above for HepG2 cells. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to pellet nuclei, whole cells, and large debris. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant from this second spin was overlaid on a preformed 10-26% iodixanol gradient and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 3 h. The resulting gradient was collected in 1-ml fractions from the top by pipette.In other experiments lipid rafts and other endosome fractions were prepared from mouse liver essentially as described by Pol et al. (52Pol A. Calvo M. Lu A. Enrich C. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1848-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Livers were isolated and homogenized, and debris was removed as just described. The initial supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 3,500 × g for 15 min and 12,000 × g for 20 min. This third supernatant was diluted with Percoll™ (Amersham Biosciences) and 0.25 m sucrose to give a final density of 1.07 g/ml. Density marker beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the solution, and it was centrifuged for 45 min at 29,000 × g and 4 °C. The Percoll™ gradient was harvested down to the 1.052 g/ml density marker, and the solution that was removed was diluted with 3 parts 0.15 m NaCl. Endosomes from this fraction were collected onto a 2.5 m sucrose cushion by centrifugation at 17,800 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The white band on top of the cushion was collected and mixed with 2.5 m sucrose to a final density of 1.15 g/ml and layered under a sucrose gradient with steps of 1.05, 1.08, 1.11, and 1.13 g/ml. This gradient was centrifuged at 197,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C, and bands were collected from each of the four interfaces. These fractions have been previously characterized (52Pol A. Calvo M. Lu A. Enrich C. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1848-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as, from top to bottom of the gradient, multivesicular bodies (MVB), compartment for the uncoupling of receptor and ligand (CURL), receptor recycling compartment (RRC), and the lipid raft or caveolae-enriched fractions (CEF).Cholesteryl Ester Hydrolysis in CEL Knockout Mice—Control and CEL-/- mice (32Howles P.N.

The injection volume was 100 μl or less. Injection was into the saphenous vein (experiment 1) or jugular vein (experiment 2). Both males and females were used with equivalent results. Approximately 45 min (experiment 1) or 90 min (experiment 2) after injection, mice were sacrificed by anesthetic overdose, and the livers were processed for sucrose gradient fractionation as described above. Lipids were extracted from the lipid raft fraction and analyzed by TLC as described to determine the amount of free and esterified cholesterol present.CEL Enzyme Activity Assay—CEL activity was measured with the cholesteryl oleate hydrolysis assay as previously described (32Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).

Several of these same FGFR3 mutations have also been identified somatically in human cancers, including multiple myeloma, bladder carcinoma, and cervical cancer. The molecular pathways exploited by FGFR3 to stimulate abnormal proliferation during neoplasia are unclear. The nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase Pyk2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2) has been shown previously to regulate apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells. Here we describe a novel interaction between FGFR3 and Pyk2, mediated by the juxtamembrane domain of FGFR3 and the kinase domain of Pyk2. Within the FGFR family, Pyk2 also interacted significantly with FGFR2. Overexpression of Pyk2 alone led to its spontaneous activation and tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in activation of Stat5B, indicated by the reporter GFP-Stat5B. These effects were completely dependent upon Tyr402, the autophosphorylation site of Pyk2, which allows recruitment of Src family members for further activating phosphorylations at other sites on Pyk2. In the presence of activated FGFR3, the activation of Pyk2 itself became independent of Tyr402, indicating that FGFR3 activation circumvents the requirement for c-Src recruitment at Tyr402 of Pyk2. We also examined the role of the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 in antagonizing Pyk2 activation. Taken together, these results suggest that signaling pathways regulated by FGFR3 may converge with Pyk2-dependent pathways to provide maximal activation of Stat5B.

Receptor tyrosine kinases comprise nearly two dozen different families of homologous proteins in humans, with at least 40 distinct members, and are responsible for the integration of many different signals that affect development, proliferation, and homeostasis. In the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; KD, kinase-dead; Stat, signal transducers and activators of transcription; PRNK, Pyk2-related nonkinase; TD, thanatophoric dysplasia; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; KD, kinase-dead; Stat, signal transducers and activators of transcription; PRNK, Pyk2-related nonkinase; TD, thanatophoric dysplasia; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type. family, four homologous receptors have been identified, designated FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4. The basic structure of FGFRs consists of three extracellular Ig-like domains stabilized by characteristic disulfide bonds, a single membrane-spanning segment, and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain (1Fantl W.J.

Fibroblast growth factors, a large family of at least 20 growth factors, act in concert with heparan sulfate proteoglycans as high affinity agonists that induce FGFR dimerization and transphosphorylation (3Ornitz D.M.

Activation of FGFRs controls an array of biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, migration, wound healing, and angiogenesis. FGFRs and their ligands play a major role in autocrine and paracrine signaling loops that have been implicated in a number of malignancies, including cancers of the stomach, breast, thyroid, prostate, and pancreas and also some leukemias (7Basilico C.

A frequent translocation observed in multiple myeloma, t(4; 14)(p16.3;q32.3), involves the FGFR3 gene and results in increased expression of FGFR3 alleles that contain activating mutations (9Chesi M.

This translocation occurs with an incidence of about 25% in multiple myeloma and places the FGFR3 gene located at 4p16.3 in proximity with the 3′ IgH enhancer at 14q32.3 leading to significant FGFR3 overexpression (9Chesi M.

Furthermore, mutations in FGFR3 were identified in the overexpressed, translocated alleles of several tumors and cell lines. The identified mutations, Y373C and K650E, correspond to germline FGFR3 mutations that cause the lethal skeletal syndromes TDI and TDII, respectively (12Rousseau F. el Ghouzzi V. Delezoide A.L.

Thus, expression of a constitutively activated FGFR3 may be an important event in aberrant signal transduction in a variety of human neoplasias.

In this study we demonstrate a novel interaction between FGFR3 and Pyk2 in human 293T cells and also in the multiple myeloma cell line UTMC-2. In these experiments, hyperactivation of FGFR3 led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. Previous work from our lab has demonstrated the activation of Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 in response to FGFR3 activation (27Kong M. Wang C.S. Donoghue D.J. J. Biol.

These experiments demonstrated a significant interaction between FGFR3 and Pyk2 signaling pathways in regulating the activation of Stat5. FGFR Constructs—The full-length FGFR3 wild type, kinase-active (TD;K650E), and myristoylated forms of FGFR3 have been previously described (31Webster M.K. D'Avis P.Y. Robertson S.C. Donoghue D.J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5739-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) The FGFR3-ΔC-term was constructed by inserting a linker from the XhoI site in FGFR3 (Leu457-Glu458) to the downstream XbaI site in the pcDNA3 vector of full-length FGFR3. The linker contained a stop codon leading to the truncation of the protein at residue 459. The FGFR3-ΔJM clone was constructed from a FGFR3-ΔC-term derivative. First the plasmid was digested with XhoI and the ends were filled in with Klenow polymerase fragment to create blunt ends. It was then digested with HindIII and ligated to a HindIII-StuI fragment containing the N terminus and transmembrane domain of FGFR3. The protein is truncated at residue 410. The full-length FGFR2, FGFR1, and FGFR4 constructs have been described previously (29Hart K.C. Robertson S.C. Kanemitsu M.Y. Meyer A.N. Tynan J.A. Donoghue D.J.

Jones K.C. Damsky C.H. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5933-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To construct the PRNK clone, the C terminus of Pyk2 was amplified after the kinase domain at the first Met residue, Met685. The PCR product was digested at the 5′ end with BamHI and at the 3′ end with XbaI and cloned into the BglII and XbaI sites on the pCS-Myc tag vector. It was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 using the BamHI site 5′ of the Myc tag and the downstream XbaI site. Pyk2-ΔKIN was truncated after residue 413. A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create an in-frame stop codon at residue 414 and a XbaI site at residues 416 and 417. The clone was digested with XbaI, cutting at this new site along with the downstream site in the vector, and ligated back together leading to deletion of the kinase and C-terminal domains. QuikChange mutagenesis was also used to construct the Pyk2-ΔFERM clone. A BsrGI site was created upstream of the FERM domain (4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin homology domain) in Pyk2. A BsrGI site was also created downstream of the FERM domain in a separate clone. A two part ligation was performed using the vector fragment, BsrGI to XbaI, from the upstream mutant and the insert, BsrGI to XbaI, from the downstream mutant leading to the deletion of the FERM domain from 39 to 364 amino acids.

Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot—293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Subconfluent cells were transfected with 0.5–10 μg of DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation (36Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated samples were washed three times with lysis buffer, boiled for 5 min in sample buffer, and separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and blocked in 3% milk, Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 or in 3% bovine serum albumin, Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (for antiphosphotyrosine blots). The membranes were immunoblotted with antibodies at room temperature for 2–3 h or overnight at 4 °C. After primary incubation the membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The proteins were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). To reprobe with other antibodies, the membranes were stripped of bound antibodies in stripping buffer (90 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and incubated for 1 h at 80 °C. Endogenous Association—For endogenous Pyk2 association with FGFR3, the human multiple myeloma cell line UTMC-2 (9Chesi M. Nardini E. Brents L.A. Schrock E. Ried T. Kuehl W.M. Bergsagel P.L. Nat.

The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated) and penicillin/streptomycin. Lysate was prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. 2.5 mg of total protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-FGFR3(C-15) as described above. Endogenous Pyk2 was detected with anti-Pyk2 (5906) on the immunoblot. Interaction of FGFR3 and Pyk2—Fig. 1 presents schematically the essential features of the FGFR3 derivatives (Fig. 1A) and Pyk2 derivatives (Fig. 1B) utilized in this study. Following transfection into 293T cells, FGFR3 was readily detected by immunoblotting of Pyk2 immunoprecipitates collected using the monoclonal antibody 9E10 against the Myc tag (Fig. 2A, top panel). Reciprocally, Pyk2 was readily detected by immunoblotting of FGFR3 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Pyk2 associates equally well with either WT or constitutively activated FGFR3 with the K650E mutation (TD) responsible for the neonatal lethal developmental syndrome thanatophoric dysplasia type II (13Tavormina P.L. Shiang R. Thompson L.M. Zhu Y.Z. Wilkin D.J. Lachman R.S. Wilcox W.R. Rimoin D.L. Cohn D.H. Wasmuth J.J. Nat.

Similarly, this association is not dependent on the kinase activity of FGFR3, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation of kinase-dead (KD) FGFR3 with Pyk2 (Fig. 2A, lane 3).Fig. 2Interaction between FGFR3 and Pyk2.A, in vivo association of FGFR3 and Pyk2 is not affected by the kinase activity of FGFR3. 293T cells were transfected with full-length FGFR3 constructs WT or TD; myristoylated FGFR3 derivatives WT, TD, or KD (31Webster M.K. D'Avis P.Y. Robertson S.C. Donoghue D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4081-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 32Webster M.K. Donoghue D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5739-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); or Myc-tagged Pyk2 (34Sieg D.J. Ilic D. Jones K.C. Damsky C.H. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5933-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated (IP) with antisera to Myc(9E10) or FGFR3 (C-15) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoblot analysis was performed using Myc(9E10) or FGFR3 (C-15) antisera. The lysates were immunoblotted (IB) with FGFR3 (C-15) to examine FGFR3 expression levels. B, the FGFR3 juxtamembrane domain is important for Pyk2 association. 293T cells were transfected with Pyk2 and FGFR3-ΔC-term or FGFR3-ΔJM. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with Pyk2 (C-19) and immunoblotted with FGFR3 (H-100) and Pyk2 (C-19) antibodies. FGFR3 expression was also examined in α-FGFR3 (H-100) immmunoprecipitates, which were then immunoblotted with α-FGFR3 (H-100). C, Pyk2 kinase domain is required for FGFR3 association. 293T cells were transfected with full-length FGFR3 and Myc-tagged Pyk2 derivatives Pyk2, Pyk2-ΔKIN, Pyk2-ΔFERM, or PRNK. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with α-Myc(9E10) and immunoblotted with FGFR3 (C-15) and Myc(9E10) antibodies. The lysates were immunoblotted with FGFR3 (C-15) to examine FGFR3 expression levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine further whether tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR3 is required for interaction with Pyk2, FGFR3 phosphorylation site add-back mutants (28Hart K.C. Robertson S.C. Donoghue D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) retaining only the single sites of tyrosine phosphorylation Tyr577, Tyr724, Tyr760, or Tyr770 were also found to interact with Pyk2 in coimmunoprecipitation experiments, as did the quadruple mutant myr-FGFR3[4F] with all four sites mutated simultaneously to Phe (data not shown). In fact, the entire kinase domain of FGFR3 can be removed without disrupting the Pyk2 interaction (Fig. 2B), as shown by interaction of Pyk2 with FGFR3-ΔC-term (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Deletion of the extracellular and transmembrane domains and attachment of an N-terminal myristoylation signal to create a biologically active myr-FGFR3 derivative (32Webster M.K. Donoghue D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5739-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) also had no effect on the association of Pyk2 with FGFR3 (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–4). Together, these observations lead us to conclude that Pyk2 is binding within the intracellular juxtamembrane domain of FGFR3. To confirm this, most of the juxtamembrane domain was deleted in the FGFR3-ΔC-term clone, thereby creating FGFR3-ΔJM, which was cotransfected with Pyk2. The interaction between Pyk2 and FGFR3 was disrupted with this clone (Fig. 2B, lane 4). This suggests that the major site of Pyk2 association is within the juxtamembrane region of FGFR3. To examine the region of Pyk2 required for the interaction with FGFR3, three different Pyk2 deletion mutants were utilized. The ΔFERM construct has residues 39–364 deleted to remove the FERM domain. The ΔKIN construct has a C-terminal truncation after residue 413 that removes the kinase domain as well as the Pro-rich and paxillin-binding domains. The PRNK clone is a naturally occurring splice variant of Pyk2 in which the FERM and kinase domains are absent, although the Pro-rich and PAX domains are retained (Fig. 1B) (39Xiong W.C. Macklem M. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These Pyk2 derivatives were transfected into 293T cells with or without full-length FGFR3-WT. Cell lysates were then used to prepare Pyk2 immunoprecipitates using α-Myc(9E10) monoclonal antibody and subsequently immunoblotted for the presence of FGFR3. As shown in Fig. 2C (top panel), only Pyk2-WT and the ΔFERM construct were able to coimmunoprecipitate FGFR3 (lanes 6 and 8). Because the Pyk2-ΔFERM construct contains the kinase domain and the Pyk2-ΔKIN and PRNK constructs do not, these results indicate that the kinase domain of Pyk2 mediates its interaction with FGFR3. The activity of Pyk2 is not important for this association, because the kinaseinactive Pyk2 (K457A) is still able to interact with FGFR3 (data not shown). Pyk2 Association with Other FGFR Family Members—In addition to FGFR3, we were interested to determine whether Pyk2 binds to other members of the FGFR family. To this effect, 293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Pyk2 and full-length FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, or FGFR4. The cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with α-Myc(9E10) monoclonal antibody for Pyk2, and immunoblotting was performed with antiserum specific for each FGFR. Both FGFR2 and FGFR3 were readily detected at similar levels (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 8); in contrast, FGFR1 and FGFR4 did not coimmunoprecipitate with Pyk2 at detectable levels (lanes 4 and 10). Similar results were obtained when immunoprecipitates of each specific FGFR were immunoblotted for the presence of Pyk2 (data not shown). This experiment indicates that Pyk2 associates with FGFR2 or FGFR3 and may play a role in signaling pathways specific to these two members of the FGFR family. Association of Endogenous FGFR3 and Pyk2—To examine whether the endogenous proteins FGFR3 and Pyk2 interact, we chose the multiple myeloma cell line UTMC-2 (37Ozaki S. Wolfenbarger D. DeBram-Hart M. Kanangat S. Weiss D.T. Solomon A. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 2207-2213PubMed Google Scholar), which expresses both proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, we were able to detect the presence of Pyk2 by immunoblotting of α-FGFR3 immunoprecipitates prepared from lysates of UTMC-2 cells (Fig. 4, lane 2). This confirms that the interaction of FGFR3 and Pyk2 can occur between endogenous proteins and is not restricted to 293T cells as a result of protein overexpression. FGFR3 Activation Leads to Increased Pyk2 Phosphorylation—Because Pyk2 is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, we examined Pyk2 for changes in phosphotyrosine content when coexpressed with FGFR3. 293T cells were transfected with FGFR3 derivatives (WT, TD, or KD) along with Pyk2 derivatives (WT, kinase-dead K457A, or c-Src-binding mutant Y402F), and Pyk2 was examined for phosphotyrosine (Fig. 5). The activated FGFR3-TD mutant, in comparison with FGFR3-WT, resulted in a modest increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2-WT (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 7). However, the activated FGFR3-TD mutant led to a significant increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the c-Src-binding mutant Pyk2-Y402F, which exhibited only negligible phosphorylation in response to FGFR3-WT (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 9). This phosphorylation was dependent upon the presence of a functional Pyk2 kinase domain, as indicated by the Pyk2-K457A mutant (Fig. 5, lanes 5, 8, and 11). These results demonstrate the ability of FGFR3 to increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2, even when c-Src recruitment is abrograted. Shp2 Antagonizes FGFR3-mediated Pyk2 Phosphorylation—Because of the reported involvement of Shp2 in antagonizing Pyk2-mediated apoptosis in human multiple myeloma cells (25Chauhan D. Hideshima T.

The increase in Pyk2 phosphorylation in the presence of FGFR3-TD was greatest when coexpressed with the phosphatase-inactive Shp2 mutant (lane 9) and was least when coexpressed with excess Shp2-WT (lane 6). These results indicate that FGFR3 activation leads to an increase in phosphorylation of Pyk2 and that this increased tyrosine phosphorylation is antagonized by the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2. Pyk2 Association with FGFR3 and Shp2—Previous work by others has shown the direct association of Shp2 with Pyk2 (26Chauhan D. Pandey P. Hideshima T. Treon S. Raje N. Davies F.E. Shima Y. Tai Y.T.

https://openalex.org/W2092882727,"Abstract The cell surface HLA-DR molecule binds foreign peptide antigen and forms an intercellular complex with the T cell receptor in the course of the development of an immune response against or immune tolerance to the antigen represented by the bound peptide. The HLA-DR molecule also functions as a receptor that mediates cell signaling pathways, including as yet poorly characterized pathway(s) leading to apoptosis. Expression of HLA-DR mRNA and protein is ordinarily inducible by interferon-γ but is not inducible in tumor cells defective for the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb). In the case of the HLA-DRA gene, which encodes the HLA-DR heavy chain, previous work has indicated that this loss of inducibility is attributable to Oct-1 binding to the HLA-DRA promoter. In this report, we used Oct-1 antisense transformants to determine that Oct-1 represses the interferon-γ response of the endogenous HLA-DRA gene. This determination is consistent with results from a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, indicating that Oct-1 occupies the endogenous HLA-DRA promoter when the HLA-DRA promoter is inactive in Rb-defective cells but not when the promoter is converted to a previously defined, transcriptionally competent state, induced by treatment of the Rb-defective cells with the HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A. In vitro DNA-protein binding analyses indicated that Oct-1 prevents HLA-DRA promoter activation by mediating the formation of a complex of proteins, termed DRAN (DRA negative), that blocks NF-Y access to the promoter."
