https://openalex.org/W2892655517,"The tundra is warming more rapidly than any other biome on Earth, and the potential ramifications are far-reaching because of global feedback effects between vegetation and climate. A better understanding of how environmental factors shape plant structure and function is crucial for predicting the consequences of environmental change for ecosystem functioning. Here we explore the biome-wide relationships between temperature, moisture and seven key plant functional traits both across space and over three decades of warming at 117 tundra locations. Spatial temperature–trait relationships were generally strong but soil moisture had a marked influence on the strength and direction of these relationships, highlighting the potentially important influence of changes in water availability on future trait shifts in tundra plant communities. Community height increased with warming across all sites over the past three decades, but other traits lagged far behind predicted rates of change. Our findings highlight the challenge of using space-for-time substitution to predict the functional consequences of future warming and suggest that functions that are tied closely to plant height will experience the most rapid change. They also reveal the strength with which environmental factors shape biotic communities at the coldest extremes of the planet and will help to improve projections of functional changes in tundra ecosystems with climate warming. Analyses of the relationships between temperature, moisture and seven key plant functional traits across the tundra and over time show that community height increased with warming across all sites, whereas other traits lagged behind predicted rates of change."

Here we report on a phase 1b clinical trial in which a combination of 3BNC117 and 10-1074, two potent monoclonal anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies that target independent sites on the HIV-1 envelope spike, was administered during analytical treatment interruption. Participants received three infusions of 30 mg kg-1 of each antibody at 0, 3 and 6 weeks. Infusions of the two antibodies were generally well-tolerated. The nine enrolled individuals with antibody-sensitive latent viral reservoirs maintained suppression for between 15 and more than 30 weeks (median of 21 weeks), and none developed viruses that were resistant to both antibodies. We conclude that the combination of the anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies 3BNC117 and 10-1074 can maintain long-term suppression in the absence of antiretroviral therapy in individuals with antibody-sensitive viral reservoirs."
https://openalex.org/W2952988698,"There are thousands of rare human disorders that are caused by single deleterious, protein-coding genetic variants1. However, patients with the same genetic defect can have different clinical presentations2-4, and some individuals who carry known disease-causing variants can appear unaffected5. Here, to understand what explains these differences, we study a cohort of 6,987 children assessed by clinical geneticists to have severe neurodevelopmental disorders such as global developmental delay and autism, often in combination with abnormalities of other organ systems. Although the genetic causes of these neurodevelopmental disorders are expected to be almost entirely monogenic, we show that 7.7% of variance in risk is attributable to inherited common genetic variation. We replicated this genome-wide common variant burden by showing, in an independent sample of 728 trios (comprising a child plus both parents) from the same cohort, that this burden is over-transmitted from parents to children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Our common-variant signal is significantly positively correlated with genetic predisposition to lower educational attainment, decreased intelligence and risk of schizophrenia. We found that common-variant risk was not significantly different between individuals with and without a known protein-coding diagnostic variant, which suggests that common-variant risk affects patients both with and without a monogenic diagnosis. In addition, previously published common-variant scores for autism, height, birth weight and intracranial volume were all correlated with these traits within our cohort, which suggests that phenotypic expression in individuals with monogenic disorders is affected by the same variants as in the general population. Our results demonstrate that common genetic variation affects both overall risk and clinical presentation in neurodevelopmental disorders that are typically considered to be monogenic."
https://openalex.org/W2892753696,"Monotherapy of HIV-1 infection with single antiretroviral agents is ineffective because error-prone HIV-1 replication leads to the production of drug-resistant viral variants1,2. Combinations of drugs can establish long-term control, however, antiretroviral therapy (ART) requires daily dosing, can cause side effects and does not eradicate the infection3,4. Although anti-HIV-1 antibodies constitute a potential alternative to ART5,6, treatment of viremic individuals with a single antibody also results in emergence of resistant viral variants7-9. Moreover, combinations of first-generation anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) had little measurable effect on the infection10-12. Here we report on a phase 1b clinical trial ( NCT02825797 ) in which two potent bNAbs, 3BNC11713 and 10-107414, were administered in combination to seven HIV-1 viremic individuals. Infusions of 30 mg kg-1 of each of the antibodies were well-tolerated. In the four individuals with dual antibody-sensitive viruses, immunotherapy resulted in an average reduction in HIV-1 viral load of 2.05 log10 copies per ml that remained significantly reduced for three months following the first of up to three infusions. In addition, none of these individuals developed resistance to both antibodies. Larger studies will be necessary to confirm the efficacy of antibody combinations in reducing HIV-1 viremia and limiting the emergence of resistant viral variants."
https://openalex.org/W2890415476,"There is evidence to suggest that increasing the level of saturation (that is, the number of sp3-hybridized carbon atoms) of small molecules can increase their likelihood of success in the drug discovery pipeline1. Owing to their favourable physical properties, alkylamines have become ubiquitous among pharmaceutical agents, small-molecule biological probes and pre-clinical candidates2. Despite their importance, the synthesis of amines is still dominated by two methods: N-alkylation and carbonyl reductive amination3. Therefore, the increasing demand for saturated polar molecules in drug discovery has continued to drive the development of practical catalytic methods for the synthesis of complex alkylamines4–7. In particular, processes that transform accessible feedstocks into sp3-rich architectures provide a strategic advantage in the synthesis of complex alkylamines. Here we report a multicomponent, reductive photocatalytic technology that combines readily available dialkylamines, carbonyls and alkenes to build architecturally complex and functionally diverse tertiary alkylamines in a single step. This olefin-hydroaminoalkylation process involves a visible-light-mediated reduction of in-situ-generated iminium ions to selectively furnish previously inaccessible alkyl-substituted α-amino radicals, which subsequently react with alkenes to form C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds. The operationally straightforward reaction exhibits broad functional-group tolerance, facilitates the synthesis of drug-like amines that are not readily accessible by other methods and is amenable to late-stage functionalization applications, making it of interest in areas such as pharmaceutical and agrochemical research."

https://openalex.org/W2742165752,"Naturalistic decision-making typically involves sequential deployment of attention to choice alternatives to gather information before a decision is made. Attention filters how information enters decision circuits, thus implying that attentional control may shape how decision computations unfold. We recorded neuronal activity from three subregions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) while monkeys performed an attention-guided decision-making task. From the first saccade to decision-relevant information, a triple dissociation of decision- and attention-related computations emerged in parallel across PFC subregions. During subsequent saccades, orbitofrontal cortex activity reflected the value comparison between currently and previously attended information. In contrast, the anterior cingulate cortex carried several signals reflecting belief updating in light of newly attended information, the integration of evidence to a decision bound and an emerging plan for what action to choose. Our findings show how anatomically dissociable PFC representations evolve during attention-guided information search, supporting computations critical for value-guided choice. Hunt, Malalasekera et al. recorded populations of prefrontal neurons from monkeys performing a visual attention-guided-choice task. The results revealed that distinct computations in three PFC subregions as information was sampled guided the eventual decision."
https://openalex.org/W2891099552,"Multi-step pathways—which consist of a sequence of reconfigurations of a structure—are central to the functionality of various natural and artificial systems. Such pathways execute autonomously in self-guided processes such as protein folding1 and self-assembly2–5, but have previously required external control to execute in macroscale mechanical systems, provided by, for example, actuators in robotics6–9 or manual folding in origami8,10–12. Here we demonstrate shape-changing, macroscale mechanical metamaterials that undergo self-guided, multi-step reconfiguration in response to global uniform compression. We avoid the need for external control by using metamaterials that are made purely of passive components. The design of the metamaterials combines nonlinear mechanical elements with a multimodal architecture that enables a sequence of topological reconfigurations caused by the formation of internal self-contacts between the elements of the metamaterial. We realize the metamaterials by using computer-controlled water-jet cutting of flexible materials, and show that the multi-step pathway and final configuration can be controlled by rational design of the nonlinear mechanical elements. We also demonstrate that the self-contacts suppress errors in the pathway. Finally, we create hierarchical architectures to extend the number of distinct reconfiguration steps. Our work establishes general principles for designing mechanical pathways, opening up new avenues for self-folding media11,12, pluripotent materials9,13 and pliable devices14 in areas such as stretchable electronics and soft robotics15. A scheme for implementing multi-step topological reorganization of a mechanical metamaterial is demonstrated, which proceeds autonomously, without the need for external control."
https://openalex.org/W2893467866,"Nucleosome positioning is critical to chromatin accessibility and is associated with gene expression programs in cells1–3. Previous nucleosome mapping methods assemble profiles from cell populations and reveal a cell-averaged pattern: nucleosomes are positioned and form a phased array that surrounds the transcription start sites of active genes3–6 and DNase I hypersensitive sites7. However, even in a homogenous population of cells, cells exhibit heterogeneity in expression in response to active signalling8,9 that may be related to heterogeneity in chromatin accessibility10–12. Here we report a technique, termed single-cell micrococcal nuclease sequencing (scMNase-seq), that can be used to simultaneously measure genome-wide nucleosome positioning and chromatin accessibility in single cells. Application of scMNase-seq to NIH3T3 cells, mouse primary naive CD4 T cells and mouse embryonic stem cells reveals two principles of nucleosome organization: first, nucleosomes in heterochromatin regions, or that surround the transcription start sites of silent genes, show large variation in positioning across different cells but are highly uniformly spaced along the nucleosome array; and second, nucleosomes that surround the transcription start sites of active genes and DNase I hypersensitive sites show little variation in positioning across different cells but are relatively heterogeneously spaced along the nucleosome array. We found a bimodal distribution of nucleosome spacing at DNase I hypersensitive sites, which corresponds to inaccessible and accessible states and is associated with nucleosome variation and variation in accessibility across cells. Nucleosome variation is smaller within single cells than across cells, and smaller within the same cell type than across cell types. A large fraction of naive CD4 T cells and mouse embryonic stem cells shows depleted nucleosome occupancy at the de novo enhancers detected in their respective differentiated lineages, revealing the existence of cells primed for differentiation to specific lineages in undifferentiated cell populations."

https://openalex.org/W2893868211,"The earliest blood vessels in mammalian embryos are formed when endothelial cells differentiate from angioblasts and coalesce into tubular networks. Thereafter, the endothelium is thought to expand solely by proliferation of pre-existing endothelial cells. Here we show that a complementary source of endothelial cells is recruited into pre-existing vasculature after differentiation from the earliest precursors of erythrocytes, megakaryocytes and macrophages, the erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) that are born in the yolk sac. A first wave of EMPs contributes endothelial cells to the yolk sac endothelium, and a second wave of EMPs colonizes the embryo and contributes endothelial cells to intraembryonic endothelium in multiple organs, where they persist into adulthood. By demonstrating that EMPs constitute a hitherto unrecognized source of endothelial cells, we reveal that embryonic blood vascular endothelium expands in a dual mechanism that involves both the proliferation of pre-existing endothelial cells and the incorporation of endothelial cells derived from haematopoietic precursors. New blood vessel endothelial cells arise from differentiation of erythro-myeloid progenitor cells to complement the proliferation of pre-existing endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2890970856,"(Abridged) Stars more massive than $20-30M_{\odot}$ are so luminous that the radiation force on the cooler, more opaque outer layers can balance or exceed the force of gravity. These near or super-Eddington outer envelopes represent a long standing challenge for calculating the evolution of massive stars in one dimension, a situation that limits our understanding of the stellar progenitors of some of the most exciting and energetic explosions in the universe. In particular, the proximity to the Eddington limit has been the suspected cause for the variability, large mass loss rate and giant eruptions of an enigmatic class of massive stars: the luminous blue variables (LBVs). When in quiescence, LBVs are usually found on the hot ($T_{eff} \approx 2 - 4 \times 10^4$ K) S Dor instability strip. While in outburst, most LBVs stay on the cold S Dor instability strip with a $T_{eff} \approx 9000$ K. Here we show that physically realistic three dimensional global radiation hydrodynamic simulations of radiation dominated massive stars with the largest supercomputers in the world naturally reproduce many observed properties of LBVs, specifically their location in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and their episodic mass loss with rates of $10^{-7}-10^{-5} M_{\odot}/yr$. The helium opacity peak is found to play an important role to determine these properties, which is not realized in the traditional one dimensional models of massive stars. The simulations also predict that convection causes irregular envelope oscillations and 10-30% brightness variations on a typical timescale of a few days. The variability is more prominent in our models that are on the cool part of the S Dor instability. These calculations pave the way to a quantitative understanding of the structure, stability and the dominant mode of mass loss of massive stars."

https://openalex.org/W2892877778,"Relativistic jets are observed throughout the Universe and strongly affect their surrounding environments on a range of physical scales, from Galactic binary systems1 to galaxies and clusters of galaxies2. All types of accreting black hole and neutron star have been observed to launch jets3, with the exception of neutron stars with strong magnetic fields4,5 (higher than 1012 gauss), leading to the conclusion that their magnetic field strength inhibits jet formation6. However, radio emission recently detected from two such objects could have a jet origin, among other possible explanations7,8, indicating that this long-standing idea might need to be reconsidered. But definitive observational evidence of such jets is still lacking. Here we report observations of an evolving jet launched by a strongly magnetized neutron star accreting above the theoretical maximum rate given by the Eddington limit. The radio luminosity of the jet is two orders of magnitude fainter than those seen in other neutron stars with similar X-ray luminosities9, implying an important role for the properties of the neutron star in regulating jet power. Our result also shows that the strong magnetic fields of ultra-luminous X-ray pulsars do not prevent such sources from launching jets. Observations of a jet from a strongly magnetized neutron star reveal that strong magnetic fields do not prevent jet formation and suggest that stellar properties influence jet power."

https://openalex.org/W2893852470,"Decellularized matrices of biologic tissue have performed well as wound care dressings. Extracellular matrix-based dressings are subject to rapid degradation by excessive protease activity at the wound environment. Stabilized, acellular, equine pericardial collagen matrix (sPCM) wound care dressing is flexible cross-linked proteolytic enzyme degradation resistant. sPCM was structurally characterized utilizing scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. In murine excisional wounds, sPCM was effective in mounting an acute inflammatory response. Postwound inflammation resolved rapidly, as indicated by elevated levels of IL-10, arginase-1, and VEGF, and lowering of IL-1β and TNF-α. sPCM induced antimicrobial proteins S100A9 and β-defensin-1 in keratinocytes. Adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus on sPCM pre-exposed to host immune cells in vivo was inhibited. Excisional wounds dressed with sPCM showed complete closure at d 14, while control wounds remained open. sPCM accelerated wound re-epithelialization. sPCM not only accelerated wound closure but also improved the quality of healing by increased collagen deposition and maturation. Thus, sPCM is capable of presenting scaffold functionality during the course of wound healing. In addition to inducing endogenous antimicrobial defense systems, the dressing itself has properties that minimize biofilm formation. It mounts robust inflammation, a process that rapidly resolves, making way for wound healing to advance.-El Masry, M. S., Chaffee, S., Das Ghatak, P., Mathew-Steiner, S.

https://openalex.org/W2894410079,"Increased colonic bile acid (BA) exposure, frequent in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), can affect gut function. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is implicated in the development of visceral hyper-sensitivity (VH). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that BAs cause VH via mucosal mast cell (MMC)-to-nociceptor signaling, which involves the farnesoid X receptor (FXR)/NGF/transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV)1 axis. BAs were intracolonically administered to rats for 15 d. Visceral sensitivity to colorectal distention and colonic NGF expression were examined. BAs caused VH, an effect that involved MMC-derived NGF and was accompanied by enhanced TRPV1 expression in the dorsal root ganglia. Anti-NGF treatment and TRPV1 antagonism inhibited BA-induced VH. BAs induced NGF mRNA and protein expression and release in cultured mast cells. Colonic supernatants from patients with IBS-D with elevated colonic BA content transcriptionally induced NGF expression. In FXR−/− mice, visceral sensitivity and colonic NGF expression were unaltered after BA treatment. Pharmacological antagonism and FXR silencing suppressed BA-induced NGF expression and release in mast cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK) 3/6/p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling was mechanistically responsible for FXR-mediated NGF expression and secretion. The findings show an MMC-dependent and FXR-mediated pronociceptive effect of BAs and identify the BA/FXR/NGF/TRPV1 axis as a key player in MMC-to-neuron communication during pain processing in IBS.—Li, W.-T., Luo, Q.-Q., Wang, B., Chen, X., Yan, X.-J., Qiu, H.-Y., Chen, S.-L.

https://openalex.org/W2893373509,"In addition to unwinding double-stranded nucleic acids, helicase activity can also unfold noncanonical structures such as G-quadruplexes. We previously characterized Pif1 helicase catalyzed unfolding of parallel G-quadruplex DNA. Here we characterized unfolding of the telomeric G-quadruplex, which can fold into antiparallel and mixed hybrid structures and found significant differences. Telomeric DNA sequences are unfolded more readily than the parallel quadruplex formed by the c-MYC promoter in K+. Furthermore, we found that under conditions in which the telomeric quadruplex is less stable, such as in Na+, Pif1 traps thermally melted quadruplexes in the absence of ATP, leading to the appearance of increased product formation under conditions in which the enzyme is preincubated with the substrate. Stable telomeric G-quadruplex structures were unfolded in a stepwise manner at a rate slower than that of duplex DNA unwinding; however, the slower dissociation from G-quadruplexes compared with duplexes allowed the helicase to traverse more nucleotides than on duplexes. Consistent with this, the rate of ATP hydrolysis on the telomeric quadruplex DNA was reduced relative to that on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), but less quadruplex DNA was needed to saturate ATPase activity. Under single-cycle conditions, telomeric quadruplex was unfolded by Pif1, but for the c-MYC quadruplex, unfolding required multiple helicase molecules loaded onto the adjacent ssDNA. Our findings illustrate that Pif1-catalyzed unfolding of G-quadruplex DNA is highly dependent on the specific sequence and the conditions of the reaction, including both the monovalent cation and the order of addition."
https://openalex.org/W2892700842,"The importance of proteostasis in preventing cellular senescence has been well recognized. However, the exact mechanism by which the loss of proteostasis or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces cellular senescence remains unclear. We report that ER stress mediates cellular senescence through the activating transcription factor (ATF)6α branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Cellular senescence was induced by the abrogation of neighbor of breast cancer (BRCA)1 gene (NBR1). NBR1 abrogation-induced senescence was p53 dependent and observed in both transformed and nontransformed human cell lines: MCF-7, Caki-1, and MRC-5. NBR1 bound to p38 MAPK, preferentially to an active form, and upon NBR1 abrogation, the activity of p38 increased. NADPH oxidase was activated in turn by p38, and the resulting oxidative stress triggered ER stress. It was found that ER stress mediated cellular senescence through the UPR sensor ATF6α. Knockdown of ATF6α prevented senescence, whereas ATF6α overexpression triggered it. The transcriptional activity of ATF6α was important. The ER stress-ATF6α axis also mediated cellular senescence induced by H-RasV12 overexpression and UV irradiation, suggesting a common role of this axis in senescence induction. In summary, we presented an evidence for the novel role of the ER stress-ATF6α axis in cellular senescence.-Kim, H. S., Kim, Y., Lim, M. J., Park, Y.-G., Park, S. I., Sohn, J.

https://openalex.org/W2894547773,"Endothelial cells can acquire a mesenchymal phenotype upon irritation [endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT)]. Macrophages accumulate in the atherosclerotic plaque. This study addressed whether macrophages modulate EndMT and delineated a reciprocal effect of EndMT on macrophage functions in atherosclerosis. In atherosclerotic murine and human aortas, endothelial cells with mesenchymal markers were elevated by confocal microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. Increased EndMT master transcription factor Snail expression and extracellular matrix are consistent with enhanced EndMT in this condition. Hypoxia was detected in individual aortic EndMT cells in vivo and rapidly induced a similar EndMT phenotype in vitro. As a novel inducer of EndMT, macrophages, which are abundant in the atherosclerotic lesions, enhance mesothelial marker expression during coculture in vitro. In the reverse relationship, EndMT altered endothelial colony-stimulating factor expression. Functionally, EndMT cell–conditioned media attenuated macrophage proliferation, antigen-presenting cell marker expression, and TNF-α production in response to oxidized LDL but increased oxidized LDL uptake and scavenger receptor expression. These experiments demonstrate that macrophages promote partial EndMT. In turn, EndMT cells modulate macrophage phenotype and lipid uptake. Our data suggest that EndMT shapes macrophage and endothelial cell phenotypes, thus affecting internal atherosclerotic plaque in addition to surface structure.—Helmke, A., Casper, J., Nordlohne, J., David, S., Haller, H., Zeisberg, E.

Here, we characterize the interaction of UBE3A and the proteasomal subunit PSMD4 (Rpn10/S5a). We map the interaction to the highly conserved Zn2+-binding N-terminal (AZUL) domain of UBE3A, the integrity of which is crucial for binding to PSMD4. Interestingly, two Angelman syndrome point mutations that affect the AZUL domain show an impaired ability to bind PSMD4.

The UBE3A gene is located on chromosome 15 (15q11.2–13). Differential splicing results in the expression of at least three UBE3A isoforms that differ only in their N termini, although no different functions for those three isoforms have yet been described (1Yamamoto Y.

Although UBE3A is biallelically expressed in most tissues, expression of the paternal allele is silenced in specific brain regions, including the hippocampus. Loss of a functional maternal UBE3A allele and therefore absence of UBE3A in these brain regions causes Angelman syndrome (33Rougeulle C. Glatt H. Lalande M.

The genetic mechanisms resulting in Angelman syndrome are varied. The majority of cases are caused by deletions of the maternal 15q11.2–13 region, but some cases show paternal uniparental disomy or imprinting defects, all of which result in a complete loss of functional UBE3A expression (38Fang P.

Some patients carry intragenic UBE3A mutations, including frameshift or missense mutations that are thought to result in the expression of truncated, nonfunctional proteins. A number of UBE3A point mutations leading to single amino acid substitutions have also been described (38Fang P. Lev-Lehman E. Tsai T.F. Matsuura T. Benton C.S. Sutcliffe J.S. Christian S.L.

Most of these point mutations are located in the C-terminal catalytic domain of UBE3A, affecting its ubiquitin ligase activity, whereas others along the length of the protein destabilize the protein, resulting in a functional loss of UBE3A (39Cooper E.M.

However, the cellular functions of UBE3A and the physiological relevance of those UBE3A interactions remain largely uncertain. UBE3A has also been shown to associate with the 26S proteasome. The physiological consequences of this interaction are not fully understood; however, conflicting studies have reported both a stimulating and an inhibitory role for UBE3A in proteasome function, which might be explained by differences in the physiological conditions used in these studies (10Yi J.J.

A recent and interesting finding of the inhibitory effect of UBE3A on the proteasome is that interaction of UBE3A with the proteasome results in the ubiquitylation and degradation of several proteasomal subunits. It was suggested that as a consequence of this proteasome inhibition, the Wnt pathway signaling protein β-catenin becomes stabilized, resulting in an up-regulation of Wnt signaling (45Yi J.J.

A recently described autism-linked UBE3A mutation (T485A) has been shown to have increased ubiquitin ligase activity and thus results in a deregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Wnt signaling plays an important role in developmental processes, including those of neuronal cells, and thus this finding might provide a direct link between a deregulation of UBE3A/proteasome interaction and autism development (10Yi J.J.

Mice with Mdm2 deficiency in ovarian granulosa cells [ Mdm2-loxP/ progesterone receptor ( Pgr)-Cre mice] were infertile as a result of impairment of oocyte maturation, ovulation, and fertilization, and those with Mdm2/p53 double deletion in granulosa cells ( Mdm2-loxP/ p53-loxP/ Pgr-Cre mice) showed normal fertility, suggesting that p53 induction in the ovarian granulosa cells is detrimental to ovarian function by disturbing oocyte quality. Another model of Mdm2 deletion in ovarian granulosa cells ( Mdm2-loxP/ anti-Mullerian hormone type 2 receptor-Cre mice) also showed subfertility as a result of the failure of ovulation and fertilization, indicating critical roles of ovarian Mdm2 in ovulation and fertilization. Mdm2-p53 pathway in cumulus granulosa cells transcriptionally controlled an orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1), a key regulator of ovarian function. Importantly, MDM2 and SF1 levels in human cumulus granulosa cells were positively associated with the outcome of oocyte maturation and fertilization in patients undergoing infertility treatment. These findings suggest that the Mdm2-p53-SF1 axis in ovarian cumulus granulosa cells directs ovarian function by affecting their neighboring oocyte quality.-Haraguchi, H., Hirota, Y., Saito-Fujita, T., Tanaka, T., Shimizu-Hirota, R., Harada, M., Akaeda, S., Hiraoka, T., Matsuo, M., Matsumoto, L., Hirata, T., Koga, K., Wada-Hiraike, O., Fujii, T., Osuga, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2892822550,"Bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been recently used in clinical trials as treatment for liver diseases. However, the underlying mechanism of their effectiveness remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we confirmed that the protective effects of MSCs on mouse model of acute liver failure (ALF) were based on MSC-secreted prostaglandin (PG)E2. Our data confirmed that MSC-secreted PGE2 not only inhibited apoptosis but also enhanced hepatocyte proliferation, thus attenuating ALF. Moreover, Yes-associated protein (YAP) played a major role in PGE2-triggered hepatocyte proliferation. In vitro studies showed that PGE2 increased the expression of PGE4 and enhanced the phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein, resulting in YAP activation and increased expression of YAP-related genes. Furthermore, the mammalian target of rapamycin, another major regulator of cell proliferation, was activated by YAP via suppressing phosphatase and tensin homolog through miR-29a-3p. These pathways coordinated to control cell proliferation. Collectively, MSCs could promote the recovery of ALF through PGE2-induced hepatocyte proliferation.—Liu, Y., Ren, H., Wang, J., Yang, F., Li, J., Zhou, Y., Yuan, X., Zhu, W., Shi, X.

The functional responses of KC and MIP2 are intimately coupled to their interactions with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAG interactions orchestrate chemokine concentration gradients and modulate receptor activity, which together regulate neutrophil trafficking. Here, using NMR, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we characterized the molecular basis of KC and MIP2 binding to the GAG heparin. Both chemokines reversibly exist as monomers and dimers, and the NMR analysis indicates that the dimer binds heparin with higher affinity. The ITC experiments indicate a stoichiometry of two GAGs per KC or MIP2 dimer and that the enthalpic and entropic contributions vary significantly between the two chemokine–heparin complexes. NMR-based structural models of heparin–KC and heparin–MIP2 complexes reveal that different combinations of residues from the N-loop, 40s turn, β3-strand, and C-terminal helix form a binding surface within a monomer and that both conserved residues and residues unique to a particular chemokine mediate the binding interactions. MD simulations indicate significant residue-specific differences in their contribution to binding and affinity for a given chemokine and between chemokines. On the basis of our observations that KC and MIP2 bind to GAG via distinct molecular interactions, we propose that the differences in these GAG interactions lead to differences in neutrophil recruitment and play nonoverlapping roles in resolution of inflammation.

However, the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of PRMT5 that may affect its biological functions remain less well-understood. In this study, using MS analyses, we found that PRMT5 itself is methylated in human erythroleukemia Lys-562 cells. Biochemical assays revealed that coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) interacts directly with and methylates PRMT5 at Arg-505 both in vivo and in vitro. Substitutions at Arg-505 significantly reduced PRMT5’s methyltransferase activity, decreased H4R3me2s enrichment at the γ-globin gene promoter, and increased the expression of the γ-globin gene in Lys-562 cells. Moreover, CARM1 knockdown consistently reduced PRMT5 activity and activated γ-globin gene expression. Importantly, we show that CARM1-mediated methylation of PRMT5 is essential for the intracellular homodimerization of PRMT5 to its active form. These results thus reveal a critical PTM of PRMT5 that represses human γ-globin gene expression. We conclude that CARM1-mediated asymmetric methylation of PRMT5 is critical for its dimerization and methyltransferase activity leading to the repression of γ-globin expression.

Thus, the screening of functional PRMT5 inhibitors as potential chemotherapeutics has been a highly pursued and promising strategy for preventing cancers and other diseases (34Richters A.

Although the crystal structure of PRMT5 was resolved 6 years ago (35Antonysamy S. Bonday Z. Campbell R.M. Doyle B. Druzina Z. Gheyi T. Han B. Jungheim L.N. Qian Y. Rauch C. Russell M. Sauder J.M.

Thus far, there have only been reports that phosphorylation or ubiquitination of PRMT5 affects its activity (36Liu F. Zhao X. Perna F. Wang L. Koppikar P. Abdel-Wahab O. Harr M.W. Levine R.L. Xu H.

In the current study, we found that PRMT5 could be methylated by CARM1 at the highly conserved residue arginine 505 (Arg-505). CARM1 repressed human γ-globin gene expression indirectly through the methylation of PRMT5, which increased histone H4R3me2s enrichment at the γ-promoter in Lys-562 cells. We have demonstrated that methylation at Arg-505 of PRMT5 is essential for its dimerization and is required for its optimal methyltransferase activity in Lys-562 cells. Our study thus reveals a novel post-translational modification of PRMT5 by CARM1 that modulates human γ-globin gene expression. In previous studies, we have shown that the PRMT5-mediated symmetric dimethylation of H4R3 induces the direct binding of DNMT3A, resulting in the methylation of adjacent CpG dinucleotides and in γ-globin gene silencing in erythroid cells (6Zhao Q.

In the current study, we used an anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to Sepharose beads to precipitate PRMT5 and its associated proteins from cellular extracts of human Lys-562 cells stably overexpressing FLAG-tagged PRMT5; in immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that LYAR (human homologue of mouse Ly-1 antibody reactive clone) interacts with PRMT5, acting as a novel transcription factor that binds the γ-globin gene, and is essential for silencing γ-globin gene expression (Fig. 1A) (38Ju J.

Interestingly, after the protein band corresponding to PRMT5 was cut out and subjected to MS analysis, we found a polypeptide with the sequence EKDRDPEAQFEPYVVR (positions 489 to 505 of PRMT5) in which the last arginine was dimethylated (Fig. 1, A and B). This last arginine residue corresponds to Arg-505 in human PRMT5. Alignment of PRMT5 sequences from different mammal species showed that this Arg-505 site is evolutionarily well-conserved (Fig. 1C). To examine the role of Arg-505 in PRMT5, we constructed two PRMT5 mutants, PRMT5-R505A and PRMT5-R505K, by mutagenesis and generated stable FLAG-tagged Lys-562 cell lines overexpressing these mutants as well as cell lines expressing WT PRMT5 and PRMT5Δ (the methyltransferase-dead mutant form of PRMT5 in which five amino acids in the S-adenosyl-l-methionine–binding motif have been deleted) using lentiviral vectors (6Zhao Q.

PRMT5 protein levels were assessed by Western blotting, and PRMT5 gene expression in the cells was quantified from total RNA by Q-RT-PCR. PRMT5 expression levels were significantly increased in these cell lines compared with the vector controls (Fig. 2, A and B). Subsequently, we performed Western blot analyses to measure the pancellular levels of the histone mark H4R3me2s, which is mediated by PRMT5. We found that the levels of H4R3me2s were significantly reduced in cells overexpressing either PRMT5-R505A or PRMT5-R505K compared with cells expressing WT PRMT5 and were similar to the levels of H4R3me3s in PRMT5Δ-expressing cells (Fig. 2C). Because MEP50 is a key component in the PRMT5-containing complex and is essential for the methyltransferase activity of PRMT5 (35Antonysamy S. Bonday Z. Campbell R.M. Doyle B. Druzina Z. Gheyi T. Han B. Jungheim L.N. Qian Y. Rauch C. Russell M. Sauder J.M. Wasserman S.R. Weichert K. Willard F.S. Zhang A. Emtage S. Crystal structure of the human PRMT5:MEP50 complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We found that PRMT5 mutants could immunoprecipitate MEP50 as well as the WT PRMT5 (Fig. S1), excluding the possibility that the mutants exhibited a decreased MEP50-binding capability in Lys-562 cells. Previously, we have found that the repressive H4R3me2s mark triggered by PRMT5 is enriched at the γ-globin gene promoter to repress γ-globin expression in Lys-562 cells (29Rank G. Cerruti L. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Jane S.M. Zhao Q. Identification of a PRMT5-dependent repressor complex linked to silencing of human fetal globin gene expression.Blood. 2010; 116 (20495075): 1585-159210.1182/blood-2009-10-251116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed the enrichment of the histone mark H4R3me2s at the γ-promoter in these cells by ChIP analysis. We found that the levels of H4R3me2s enrichment at the γ-promoter in cells overexpressing mutant PRMT5 were significantly lower than in the cells overexpressing WT PRMT5 (Fig. 2D). Consistently, γ-globin gene expression was significantly increased in cells overexpressing the two mutant forms of PRMT5 compared with the WT cells (Fig. 2E). Therefore, these results suggest that the methylation of PRMT5 at Arg-505 is essential for its methyltransferase activity in cells and is important for the repression of γ-globin gene expression in Lys-562 cells. Although we found that PRMT5 was dimethylated at Arg-505 in MS analysis, whether the dimethylation was symmetric or asymmetric could not be determined. To identify the methyltransferase responsible for the methylation of PRMT5, we purified three major arginine methyltransferases—the recombinant fusion proteins GST-PRMT1 and GST-CARM1 from Escherichia coli, and the FLAG-tagged PRMT5 (PRMT5-f) from Lys-562 cells (Fig. 3, B–D, left)—as well as their potential substrate, the recombinant PRMT5 protein (rPRMT5) from E. coli (Fig. 3A). Of note, the recombinant PRMT5 protein from E. coli has never been observed to exhibit methyltransferase activity in vitro (35Antonysamy S. Bonday Z. Campbell R.M. Doyle B. Druzina Z. Gheyi T. Han B. Jungheim L.N. Qian Y. Rauch C. Russell M. Sauder J.M. Wasserman S.R. Weichert K. Willard F.S. Zhang A. Emtage S. Crystal structure of the human PRMT5:MEP50 complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We used free histones as substrates to confirm the enzymatic activity of GST-PRMT1, GST-CARM1, and PRFT5-f in Western blot analysis using specific antibodies against histone H4R3me2a, H3R17me2a, and H4R3me2s, respectively (Fig. 3, B–D, left). Subsequently, the purified recombinant PRMT5 protein from E. coli was incubated with each methyltransferase independently in the presence of 3H-SAM, the methyl donor. After SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, we found that there was a 3H-labeled protein band corresponding to the size of PRMT5 only when the recombinant PRMT5 was incubated with GST-CARM1 (Fig. 3C, right). No signals were detectable after incubation with GST-PRMT1 or PRMT5-f (Fig. 3, B and D, right). These results demonstrate that PRMT5 may be methylated by CARM1 in vitro and that there is no automethylation of PRMT5. To test whether CARM1 and PRMT5 interact in vitro, a GST pulldown experiment was performed. As shown in Fig. 4A, GST-CARM1 could readily pull down the purified recombinant PRMT5, whereas GST did not interact with PRMT5. Further PRMT5 fragmentation pulldown assays demonstrated that only amino acids 454–637 of PRMT5 interacted with CARM1 (Fig. 4B). Of note, Arg-505 is located in this region (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with its methylation by CARM1. Indeed, we found that PRMT5 coimmunoprecipitated with CARM1 protein from a Lys-562 cellular extract (Fig. 4C). Thus, these results indicate that PRMT5 and CARM1 interact in cells and provide support for CARM1-mediated PRMT5 methylation. To examine whether Arg-505 in PRMT5 is asymmetrically dimethylated, we used the peptide MPYVVR (me2a) LHNFH, which corresponds to amino acids 500–510 of the human PRMT5 protein, where arginine is asymmetrically demethylated, as an antigen to generate a rabbit polyclonal antibody. Dot blot and peptide competition assays confirmed that this anti-PRMT5-R505me2a antibody specifically recognized the peptide in which Arg-505 was asymmetrically dimethylated, not the nonmethylated peptide (Fig. S2, A and B). To determine the role of CARM1 in the methylation of PRMT5, we generated two stable CARM1 knockdown (CARM1-KD) Lys-562 cell lines using lentiviral vectors containing specific shRNAs. CARM1 protein levels were assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 5A), and gene expression in these cells was quantified from total RNA by Q-RT-PCR (Fig. 5B). CARM1 expression levels were reduced in these two cell lines to ∼30% of the expression in the scrambled control. Indeed, the methylation of PRMT5 was greatly reduced in CARM1-KD Lys-562 cell lines compared with scrambled cells as revealed by Western blot analysis using the PRMT5-R505me2a antibody (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, this reduction was accompanied by significantly decreased levels of the histone mark H4R3me2s, which is triggered by PRMT5, although the total levels of cellular PRMT5 were not changed (Fig. 5A). We consistently observed significantly elevated expression of γ-globin in CARM1-KD ce"
https://openalex.org/W2951251264,"DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) is a synthetic chemical identified by the US Department of Agriculture in 1946 in a screen for repellents to protect soldiers from mosquito-borne diseases1,2. Since its discovery, DEET has become the world’s most widely used arthropod repellent and is effective against invertebrates separated by millions of years of evolution—including biting flies3, honeybees4, ticks5, and land leeches3. In insects, DEET acts on the olfactory system5–12 and requires the olfactory receptor co-receptor Orco7,9–12, but exactly how it works remains controversial13. Here we show that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is sensitive to DEET and use this genetically tractable animal to study the mechanism of action of this chemical. We found that DEET is not a volatile repellent, but instead interferes selectively with chemotaxis to a variety of attractant and repellent molecules. In a forward genetic screen for DEET-resistant worms, we identified a gene that encodes a single G protein-coupled receptor, str-217, which is expressed in a single pair of chemosensory neurons that are responsive to DEET, called ADL neurons. Mis-expression of str-217 in another chemosensory neuron conferred responses to DEET. Engineered str-217 mutants, and a wild isolate of C. elegans that carries a str-217 deletion, are resistant to DEET. We found that DEET can interfere with behaviour by inducing an increase in average pause length during locomotion, and show that this increase in pausing requires both str-217 and ADL neurons. Finally, we demonstrated that ADL neurons are activated by DEET and that optogenetic activation of ADL neurons increased average pause length. This is consistent with the ‘confusant’ hypothesis, which proposes that DEET is not a simple repellent but that it instead modulates multiple olfactory pathways to scramble behavioural responses10,11. Our results suggest a consistent motif in the effectiveness of DEET across widely divergent taxa: an effect on multiple chemosensory neurons that disrupts the pairing between odorant stimulus and behavioural response. DEET interferes selectively with chemotaxis of Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, and mutations in the str-217 gene or silencing of the pair of chemosensory neurons that express it makes worms DEET-resistant."

Regulation of G protein–coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels by G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) via the G protein βγ subunits has been well characterized. However, how Kir channels are regulated is incompletely understood. We report here that Kir7.1 is also regulated by GPCRs, but through a different mechanism. Using Western blotting analysis, we observed that multiple GPCRs tested caused a striking reduction in the complex glycosylation of Kir7.1. Further, GPCR-mediated reduction of Kir7.1 glycosylation in HEK293T cells did not alter its expression at the cell surface but decreased channel activity. Of note, mutagenesis of the sole Kir7.1 glycosylation site reduced conductance and open probability, as indicated by single-channel recording. Additionally, we report that the L241P mutation of Kir7.1 associated with Lebers congenital amaurosis (LCA), an inherited retinal degenerative disease, has significantly reduced complex glycosylation. Collectively, these results suggest that Kir7.1 channel glycosylation is essential for function, and this activity within cells is suppressed by most GPCRs.

Med. 2014; 6 (25056913): 1161-117410.15252/emmm.201403944Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Specifically, Kir7.1 expression is elevated by 30-fold midgestation, hyperpolarizing muscle cells and reducing uterine excitability. This expression falls off toward the end of pregnancy, leading to parturition. In the mouse, Kir7.1-null mutations cause perinatal lethality, and this was determined to be due to a role for Kir7.1 in tracheal tubulogenesis (13Yin W. Kim H.T. Wang S. Gunawan F. Wang L. Kishimoto K. Zhong H. Roman D. Preussner J. Guenther S. Graef V. Buettner C. Grohmann B. Looso M. Morimoto M. et al.The potassium channel KCNJ13 is essential for smooth muscle cytoskeletal organization during mouse tracheal tubulogenesis.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 (30022023)281510.1038/s41467-018-05043-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Kir7.1 was also revealed to be a potential regulator of neuronal excitability in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, through modulation of channel activity by the G protein–coupled melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) (14Ghamari-Langroudi M. Digby G.J. Sebag J.A. Millhauser G.L. Palomino R. Matthews R. Gillyard T. Panaro B.L. Tough I.R. Cox H.M. Denton J.S. Cone R.D. G-protein-independent coupling of MC4R to Kir7.1 in hypothalamic neurons.Nature. 2015; 520 (25600267): 94-9810.1038/nature14051Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Activation of MC4R led to robust neuronal depolarization, which was found to be mediated by Kir7.1 channel closure. Conversely, inhibition of MC4R by an endogenous inverse agonist, AgRP, led to channel opening and hyperpolarization of the neuron. These results are interesting in that Kir7.1 is not a canonical G protein–coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel such as Kir3.x. Furthermore, in HEK293T cells, Kir7.1 was found to exist in a complex with MC4R (14Ghamari-Langroudi M. Digby G.J. Sebag J.A. Millhauser G.L. Palomino R. Matthews R. Gillyard T. Panaro B.L. Tough I.R. Cox H.M. Denton J.S. Cone R.D.

Mechanisms by which non-GIRK channels interact with GPCRs vary, with some channels behaving like GIRKs, such as Kir2.x channels. Specifically, unlike Kir2.1, it has been reported that Kir2.3 channels can be inhibited directly by Gβγ complexes (15Cohen N.A. Sha Q. Makhina E.N. Lopatin A.N. Linder M.E. Snyder S.H. Nichols C.G. Inhibition of an inward rectifier potassium channel (Kir2.3) by G-protein βγ subunits.J. Biol.

Moreover, within dendritic spines of cholinergic neurons, M1 receptor activation has been shown to lead to inhibition of Kir2.x channels through Gq activation of phospholipase C, which depletes the second messenger phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) that is needed for Kir channel function (16Shen W. Tian X. Day M. Ulrich S. Tkatch T. Nathanson N.M. Surmeier D.J. Cholinergic modulation of Kir2 channels selectively elevates dendritic excitability in striatopallidal neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10 (17906621): 1458-146610.1038/nn1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Kir7.1 likewise has a PIP2 dependence for activity and was recently shown in RPE cells to be regulated by the oxytocin Gq–coupled GPCR, through phospholipase C–mediated inhibition (17York N. Halbach P. Chiu M.A. Bird I.M. Pillers D.M. Pattnaik B.R. Oxytocin (OXT)-stimulated inhibition of Kir7.1 activity is through PIP2-dependent Ca2+ response of the oxytocin receptor in the retinal pigment epithelium in vitro.Cell Signal. 2017; 37 (28603013): 93-10210.1016/j.cellsig.2017.06.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the MC4R-mediated closure of Kir7.1 was found to be independent of G proteins (14Ghamari-Langroudi M. Digby G.J. Sebag J.A. Millhauser G.L. Palomino R. Matthews R. Gillyard T. Panaro B.L. Tough I.R. Cox H.M. Denton J.S. Cone R.D.

The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown, and examples exist of receptors interacting with Kir channels in the absence of G proteins and other second messengers. Specifically, Kir6.2 and the non-GPCR sulfonylurea receptor (SUR), a target of sulfonylurea drugs used to treat diabetes, form the KATP channel (18Raphemot R. Swale D.R. Dadi P.K. Jacobson D.A. Cooper P. Wojtovich A.P. Banerjee S. Nichols C.G. Denton J.S. Direct activation of β-cell KATP channels with a novel xanthine derivative.Mol. Pharmacol. 2014; 85 (24646456): 858-86510.1124/mol.114.091884Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This heterooctamer composed of Kir6.2 subunits in 1:1 stoichiometry with SUR1/2 is expressed in the pancreas, and ATP binding to the SUR subunits increases channel open probability (19Aittoniemi J. Fotinou C. Craig T.J. de Wet H. Proks P. Ashcroft F.M. Review. SUR1: a unique ATP-binding cassette protein that functions as an ion channel regulator.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2009; 364 (18990670): 257-26710.1098/rstb.2008.0142Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). SUR communicates with Kir6.2 through direct interaction between the C-terminal tail of Kir6.2 and an intracellular loop of SUR (20Martin G.M. Yoshioka C. Rex E.A. Fay J.F. Xie Q. Whorton M.R. Chen J.Z. Shyng S.-L.

In our initial investigations of potential molecular mechanisms of interaction for Kir7.1 with MC4R, we observed that co-expression of several GPCRs with Kir7.1 in HEK293T cells led to a dramatic reduction in complex glycosylated forms of Kir7.1 present in the cell. A review of the role of glycosylation within this family of inwardly rectifying potassium channels revealed that glycosylation of Kir1.1, a close family member, reduces open channel probability (22Pabon A.

In patients with multiple sclerosis, autoantibodies against glycosylated forms of Kir4.1 have been reported, but the role for this in the pathophysiology of the disease is unclear (24Marnetto F. Valentino P. Caldano M. Bertolotto A. Detection of potassium channel KIR4.1 antibodies in multiple sclerosis patients.J. Immunol.

A role for glycosylation of Kir7.1 has not been investigated. We report here on a novel functional role of GPCRs in the complex glycosylation and function of Kir7.1. The α-MSH neuropeptide regulates food intake and energy expenditure through the MC4R, a G protein–coupled receptor. Studies of MC4R neurons suggested this receptor regulates neuronal depolarization and activation by ligand-mediated regulation of the conductance of Kir7.1 (14Ghamari-Langroudi M. Digby G.J. Sebag J.A. Millhauser G.L. Palomino R. Matthews R. Gillyard T. Panaro B.L. Tough I.R. Cox H.M. Denton J.S. Cone R.D. G-protein-independent coupling of MC4R to Kir7.1 in hypothalamic neurons.Nature. 2015; 520 (25600267): 94-9810.1038/nature14051Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Further, these studies supported a G protein–independent mechanism of regulation of Kir7.1. To investigate this unusual mode of Kir regulation, we first co-expressed a C-terminal FLAG-tagged Kir7.1 either with 3× HA–MC4R or as a control with the widely studied β2-adrenergic receptor (3× HA–β2AR) in HEK293T cells in the absence of ligand. We selected the β2AR as a control because like the MC4R this receptor also couples to GαS. Unexpectedly, we observed a significant reduction in the 50-kDa migrating doublet of Kir7.1 when co-expressed with β2AR, whereas MC4R caused a small increase in this form of the channel in some experiments (Fig. 1A). Treatment of cells with melanocortin agonists, shown to reduce Kir7.1 currents in MC4R neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (14Ghamari-Langroudi M. Digby G.J. Sebag J.A. Millhauser G.L. Palomino R. Matthews R. Gillyard T. Panaro B.L. Tough I.R. Cox H.M. Denton J.S. Cone R.D. G-protein-independent coupling of MC4R to Kir7.1 in hypothalamic neurons.Nature. 2015; 520 (25600267): 94-9810.1038/nature14051Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), had no effect on the typical amount or pattern of Kir7.1 bands observed (not shown). Using endoglycosidases, we confirmed the upper 50-kDa bands as the Endo H–resistant mature/complex glycosylated form of the channel, indicating that these bands are Kir7.1 that include glycans added in the Golgi complex (Fig. 1B). With Endo H treatment, the 37-kDa doublet migrated as a single band, indicating Endo H sensitivity. As Endo H–sensitive glycans are added in the endoplasmic reticulum, we identified this upper 37-kDa band as the core glycosylated form and classified this lower band as the unglycosylated form of Kir7.1. Additionally, treatment with the glycosidase PNGase F, which cleaves all N-linked glycans of proteins, resulted in a single migrating band at 37 kDa, confirming that Kir7.1 glycosylation is N-linked (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we established a metric for the proportion of Kir7.1 complex glycosylation, by determining the ratio of mature/complex glycosylation, to immature core glycosylated plus unglycosylated forms of the protein. Although some variability in this ratio was seen, a value of ∼1 was typically observed across multiple Kir7.1 expression trials in HEK293T cells in the absence of GPCR co-expression. Co-expression with β2AR reduced the ratio of glycosylation to less than 0.5, whereas MC4R exhibited a trend toward increasing this ratio, indicating opposing effects of these GPCRs (Fig. 1C). With the striking observation of reduced Kir7.1 glycosylation following β2AR but not MC4R co-expression, we were curious whether differences in receptor expression levels could account for the proportion of Kir7.1 complex glycosylation observed. To examine this, we co-expressed Kir7.1 with increasing amounts of either MC4R or β2AR protein and assessed glycosylation by Western blotting analysis. We observed that increasing the amount of MC4R expressed had no effect on proportion of Kir7.1 complex glycosylation, whereas increasing amounts of β2AR potentiated the loss of complex glycosylation (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, co-expression with β2AR appeared to be increasing the amounts of core-glycosylated/immature Kir7.1 expressed. We determined the change in ratio of Kir7.1 glycosylation with changes in receptor expression, and β2AR mediated a progressive reduction in the ratio of complex to immature forms (unglycosylated and core glycosylated) of Kir7.1 (Fig. 2C). Increases in the amount of MC4R protein expressed did not have an effect on the ratio of mature/immature forms of Kir7.1. As a control, and to determine whether the effect on glycosylation was specific to Kir7.1, we assessed whether overexpression of either GPCR would alter the glycosylation of the widely studied vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) tagged with GFP. VSVG–GFP is used to elucidate protein trafficking, where forms of the protein that have mature/complex glycosylation are Endo H–resistant. This can be determined by observing a band shift when comparing Endo H–treated versus untreated cell lysates of VSVG–GFP with either GPCR. We first treated cells transiently expressing VSVG–GFP only with a transport inhibitor (brefeldin A/monesin) to prevent complex glycosylation and observed the band shift compared with untreated samples as a control (Fig. 2D). Keeping expression levels of Kir7.1 constant throughout (0.25 μg of expression vector) and varying β2AR expression 5-fold (from 0.05 to 0.25 μg of expression vector), the high expression levels of β2AR that altered Kir7.1 glycosylation in Fig. 1A (0.25 μg of expression vector) had no effect on the glycosylation of the VSVG–GFP protein (Fig. 2E, seventh and eighth lanes). Only when β2AR was overexpressed 3-fold relative to Kir7.1 (0.25 μg of Kir7.1, 0.75 μg of β2AR) was VSVG–GFP glycosylation affected, most likely because of squelching of glycosylation machinery. With the exception of the overexpression shown in Fig. 2E (ninth and tenth lanes), the Western blotting analyses reported here never exceeded the 1:1 transfection of 0.25 μg each of Kir7.1 and β2AR expression vectors. MC4R also did not alter VSVG–GFP glycosylation at levels used throughout this experiment (Fig. 2F). These data further indicated a unique effect of β2AR expression, in contrast with MC4R, on suppression of Kir7.1 complex glycosylation, at expression levels that have no effect on the glycosylation of VSVG protein. Given the specific effect of β2AR on Kir7.1 glycosylation, we investigated whether this had an effect on the function of Kir7.1. To study the functional effect of the β2AR-mediated loss of Kir7.1 complex glycosylation, Kir7.1 whole-cell recordings were performed in the absence of any ligand in transfected HEK293T cells. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed following Kir7.1 transfection and overexpression of either β2AR or MC4R. Because the Kir7.1 WT channel was found to have a small unitary conductance (2Döring F. Derst C. Wischmeyer E. Karschin C. Schneggenburger R. Daut J. Karschin A. The epithelial inward rectifier channel Kir7.1 displays unusual K+ permeation properties.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18 (9786970): 8625-863610.1523/JNEUROSCI.18-21-08625.1998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we used a mutant form of the channel in which the methionine within the pore was replaced with an arginine typically found in the pore of other two-transmembrane domain Kir channels (Kir7.1-M125R). This mutant has been widely validated and used in multiple studies of Kir7.1 activity (2Döring F. Derst C. Wischmeyer E. Karschin C. Schneggenburger R. Daut J. Karschin A. The epithelial inward rectifier channel Kir7.1 displays unusual K+ permeation properties.J.

Kir7.1-M125R expressed alone compared with co-expression with MC4R yielded no differences in whole-cell current, which aligned with previous observations (14Ghamari-Langroudi M. Digby G.J. Sebag J.A. Millhauser G.L. Palomino R. Matthews R. Gillyard T. Panaro B.L. Tough I.R. Cox H.M. Denton J.S. Cone R.D.

However, β2AR caused a >50% reduction in Kir7.1 whole cell–mediated currents (Fig. 3, C and D). Because Kir7.1-M125R channels exhibit barium sensitivity, activity of expressed Kir7.1 was taken as the total amount of current inhibited by barium at the end of the experiment. In general, reduced responses to changes in voltage were observed when Kir7.1 was co-expressed with β2AR (Fig. 3D). Because these experiments were performed in the absence of ligand, this suggested that glycosylation either reduces the amount of functional channel at the surface of the cell or directly alters channel function. We next investigated whether co-expression with β2AR altered the amount of Kir7.1 trafficked to the cell surface. Cells co-expressing β2AR or MC4R with Kir7.1 were biotin-labeled and assessed for cell surface expression by Western blotting analysis. This method allowed visualization of the different glycosylated forms of Kir7.1 reaching the cell surface. Surprisingly, Kir7.1 co-expression with β2AR and loss of complex glycosylation did not cause a reduction in the percentage of Kir7.1 protein on the cell surface (Fig. 4B). MC4R likewise had no effect on Kir7.1 surface expression. Additionally, we assessed whether the ratio of complex to immature forms of Kir7.1 at the surface changed in the presence of these GPCRs (Fig. 4C). This remained unchanged, with β2AR maintaining a <0.5 ratio of complex Kir7.1 glycosylation compared with the total glycosylated Kir7.1 expressed in the cell. A slight reduction in the ratio of surface mature/immature Kir7.1 following MC4R expression was observed, but this trend was not significant over multiple experiments. These results therefore indicate that complex glycosylation is not required for surface expression of Kir7.1. Within the Kir family, the functional role of glycosylation has been studied for ROMK (Kir1.1) and GIRK1 (Kir3.1) (22Pabon A. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Wu X. Logothetis D.E. Thornhill W.B. Glycosylation of GIRK1 at Asn119 and ROMK1 at Asn117 has different consequences in potassium channel function.J. Biol.

Although loss of glycosylation at Asn-119 in GIRK1 was reported not to be required for function, loss of glycosylation at Asn-117 in ROMK1 reduced open channel probability and whole-cell currents (23Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. Potassium channel structure and function as reported by a single glycosylation sequon.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (7797521): 15336-1534010.1074/jbc.270.25.15336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Additionally, although Kir3.4 is reported to have an asparagine accessible for glycosylation, the site was found to be inactive (22Pabon A. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Wu X. Logothetis D.E. Thornhill W.B. Glycosylation of GIRK1 at Asn119 and ROMK1 at Asn117 has different consequences in potassium channel function.J. Biol.

Based on these studies, we aligned the Kir7.1 protein sequence with ROMK and GIRK1 and determined that Kir7.1 also shared a highly conserved glycosylation site (Fig. 5A). We mutated this site to a glutamine (Kir7.1-N95Q) and confirmed by Western blotting analysis the loss of both core and complex forms of glycosylation (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, we generated a model of Kir7.1 based on the Kir2.2 crystal structure using SWISS-MODEL, which revealed the likely glycosylation site to be in the outer loops gating the pore (Fig. 5C). This was suggestive of a functional role for glycosylation in Kir7.1. To assess this, we performed single-channel recordings using the M125R mutant of Kir7.1 to compare the WT fully glycosylated channel (Kir7.1-M125R) to the unglycosylated mutant channel (Kir7.1-M125-N95Q). WT Kir7.1 displayed clusters"

https://openalex.org/W2892500404,"Upper digestive tract (UDT) cancer is rare in cattle, however in Southern Brazil, the UDT squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are relatively common and have been associated with bracken fern consumption and the presence of papillomas. Although a theory of pathogenesis considers bovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV-4) as a cofactor in the development of these SCCs, some aspects of the etiopathogenesis of this disease need to be more investigated. In fact, detection of BPV-4 in UDT papillomas is scarce in other regions of the world and has not been performed in Brazil. Therefore, this study had two aims: 1) to analyze the epidemiological, clinical and pathological aspects of 100 natural cases of SCCs in the UDT of cattle grazing on bracken fern (Pteridium arachnoideum) highly contaminated areas, investigating the associations between these parameters; and 2) to investigate the presence of papillomavirus DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the UDT papillomas (n = 47) from 30 cattle that also had UDT SCCs. There were statistically significant associations between clinical signs and tumor localization in the UDT; between histological grade of differentiation and tumor localization; and a trend towards significant association between histological grade of differentiation and presence of metastases. The average age of cattle with oropharyngeal SCCs was 7.39 years, with statistically significant difference comparing to cattle with esophageal SCCs (8.6 years). No statistical association was observed among other clinical-pathological parameters (growth pattern and primary site of the tumor) analyzed. No BPV DNA was detected in papillomas by PCR. Therefore, these results suggest the possibility that papillomas of the UDT are not necessarily associated with BPV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2892601112,"Previous work suggests that to restore postural stability for individuals with lower-limb amputation, ankle-foot prostheses should be designed with a flat effective rocker shape for standing. However, most commercially available ankle-foot prostheses are designed with a curved effective rocker shape for walking. To address the demands of both standing and walking, we designed a novel bimodal ankle-foot prosthesis that can accommodate both functional modes using a rigid foot plate and an ankle that can lock and unlock. The primary objective of this study was to determine if the bimodal ankle-foot system could improve various aspects of standing balance (static, dynamic, and functional) and mobility in a group of Veterans with lower-limb amputation (n = 18). Standing balance was assessed while subjects completed a series of tests on a NeuroCom Clinical Research System (NeuroCom, a Division of Natus, Clackamas, OR), including a Sensory Organization Test, a Limits of Stability Test, and a modified Motor Control Test. Few statistically significant differences were observed between the locked and unlocked ankle conditions while subjects completed these tests. However, in the absence of visual feedback, the locked bimodal ankle appeared to improve static balance in a group of experienced lower-limb prosthesis users whose PLUS-M mobility rating was higher than approximately 73% of the sample population used to develop the PLUS-M survey. Given the statistically significant increase in mean equilibrium scores between the unlocked and locked conditions (p = 0.004), future testing of this system should focus on new amputees and lower mobility users (e.g., Medicare Functional Classification Level K1 and K2 prosthesis users). Furthermore, commercial implementation of the bimodal ankle-foot system should include a robust control system that can automatically switch between modes based on the user’s activity."
https://openalex.org/W2893324971,"The environmental stimuli experienced by a female can influence phenotypes and gene expression in the subsequent generations. We used a specifically designed domesticated-bird model to examine the transgenerational transmission of maternal stimulus exposure, a phenomenon that has been observed but has not been understood in noninbred animals. We subjected parental generation [filial (F)0] hens to viral- or bacterial-like stimulation after artificial insemination. Subsequent filial generations F1 and F2 transmitted growth or fertility variations without further stimulation in contrast to the controls. The whole-genome bisulfite sequence and next-generation mRNA sequencing of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from the F1 generation revealed DNA methylome and transcriptome differences in the F1 polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic [poly(I:C)] acid or LPS offspring, compared with the F1 controls. In the F1 offspring, DNA methylation changes induced by maternal immune stimulation may have contributed to transcriptional variation. Pathways analysis indicated that the metabolic processes of xenobiotics and drug metabolism pathways, as well as reproduction-related pathways, were involved in the transgenerational transmission of maternal stimulatory experience. Furthermore, LPS-induced transcriptional transmission may have contributed to subfertility, as indicated by the results of comparative analysis between the transcriptomes of spleen tissues across the F0 and F1 generations, as well as the correlative analysis between the transcriptome and reproductive phenotypes. Our findings provide a framework for determining the mechanisms by which maternal stimulatory factors can be inherited transgenerationally with respect to growth, fertility, DNA methylation, and transcriptional levels in outbred animals.-Liu, L., Yang, N., Xu, G., Liu, S., Wang, D., Song, J., Duan, Z., Yang, S., Yu, Y.

In addition to its role as a plasma membrane protein in cytoskeletal organization, recent in vitro studies have revealed that both transmembrane and cytosolic fragments of proteolytically cleaved vertebrate L1CAM translocate to the nucleus. In vitro studies indicate that nuclear L1CAM affects genes with functions in DNA post-replication repair, cell cycle control, and cell migration and differentiation, but its in vivo role and how its nuclear levels are regulated is less well-understood. Here, we report that mutations in the conserved ankyrin-binding domain affect nuclear levels of the sole Drosophila homolog neuroglian (Nrg) and that it also has a noncanonical role in regulating transcript levels of the oncogene Myc in the adult nervous system. We further show that altered nuclear levels of Nrg correlate with altered transcript levels of Myc in neurons, similar to what has been reported for human glioblastoma stem cells. However, whereas previous in vitro studies suggest that increased nuclear levels of L1CAM promote tumor cell survival, we found here that elevated levels of nuclear Nrg in neurons are associated with increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and reduced life span of adult animals. We therefore conclude that these findings are of potential relevance to the management of neurodegenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress and cancer.

The rapid spread of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is a global health emergency and there is a lack of new drugs to control MDR pathogens. We describe a heretofore-unexplored discovery pathway for novel antibiotics that is based on self-targeting, structure-disrupting peptides. We show that a helical peptide, KFF- EcH3, derived from the Escherichia coli methionine aminopeptidase can disrupt secondary and tertiary structure of this essential enzyme, thereby killing the bacterium (including MDR strains). Significantly, no detectable resistance developed against this peptide. Based on a computational analysis, our study predicted that peptide KFF- EcH3 has the strongest interaction with the structural core of the methionine aminopeptidase. We further used our approach to identify peptide KFF- NgH1 to target the same enzyme from Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This peptide inhibited bacterial growth and was able to treat a gonococcal infection in a human cervical epithelial cell model. These findings present an exciting new paradigm in antibiotic discovery using self-derived peptides that can be developed to target the structures of any essential bacterial proteins.-Zhan, J., Jia, H., Semchenko, E.

https://openalex.org/W2894472961,"The DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathway facilitates the bypass of the fork-blocking lesions without removing them through either translesion DNA synthesis or error-free damage bypass mechanism. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad5 is a multi-functional protein involved in the error-free branch of the DDT pathway, and its protein level periodically fluctuates through the cell cycle; however, the mechanistic basis and functional importance of the Rad5 level for the cell cycle regulation remain unclear. Here, we show that Rad5 is predominantly phosphorylated on serine 130 (S130) during S/G2 phase and that this modification depends on the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28/CDK1. We also show that the phosphorylated Rad5 species at S130 exhibit a relatively short half-life compared with non-phosphorylated Rad5 moiety, and that the Rad5 protein is partially stabilized in phosphorylation-defective rad5 S130A cells. Importantly, the elimination of this modification results in a defective cell-cycle dependent Rad5 oscillation pattern. Together, our results demonstrate that CDK1 modulates Rad5 stability by phosphorylation during the cell cycle, suggesting a crosstalk between the phosphorylation and degradation of Rad5."
https://openalex.org/W2894525431,"DNA lesions induce recruitment and accumulation of various repair factors, resulting in formation of discrete nuclear foci. Using superresolution fluorescence microscopy as well as live cell and quantitative imaging, we demonstrate that X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 (XRCC1), a key factor in single-strand break and base excision repair, is recruited into nuclear bodies formed in response to replication-related single-strand breaks. Intriguingly, these bodies are assembled immediately in the vicinity of these breaks and never fully colocalize with replication foci. They are structurally organized, containing canonical promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear body protein SP100 concentrated in a peripheral layer, and XRCC1 in the center. They also contain other factors, including PML, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), ligase IIIα, and origin recognition complex subunit 5. The breast cancer 1 and -2 C terminus domains of XRCC1 are essential for formation of these repair foci. These results reveal that XRCC1-contaning foci constitute newly recognized PML-like nuclear bodies that accrete and locally deliver essential factors for repair of single-strand DNA breaks in replication regions.-Kordon, M. M., Szczurek, A., Berniak, K., Szelest, O., Solarczyk, K., Tworzydło, M., Wachsmann-Hogiu, S., Vaahtokari, A., Cremer, C., Pederson, T., Dobrucki, J. W.

https://openalex.org/W2894210183,"Homing tracks of two groups of pigeons, Columba livia f. domestica, were analyzed in view of difference between individual birds and correlations between characteristic variables, looking at the initial phase while the pigeons were still at the release site, and the homing phase separately. Individual birds differed significantly in their flying speed during the initial phase, and one pigeon tended to stay longer at the release site than the others. There were no significant differences in steadiness and efficiency, indicating that all pigeons homed equally well. Differences in correlation dimension, a variable reflecting the complexity of the navigational process, reflect differences in the use of navigational information, with one bird apparently using less complex information than others. The flying speed during the initial phase was positively correlated with the flying speed during the homing phase. During the homing phase, the steadiness of flight and the efficiency of homing were closely correlated, and both tended to be positively correlated with the correlation dimension, suggesting that birds that use more complex navigational information home more efficiently."

https://openalex.org/W2894288310,"Chemokines interact with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) at the cellular surface and to specific cell-surface receptors to activate signaling pathways. The GAG interaction allows the formation of a chemotactic gradient of chemokine required for cell haptotaxis and chemokine oligomerization. Poxviruses encode secreted chemokine-binding proteins with no sequence similarity to their cellular counterparts to modulate the host immune system. The E163 protein from ectromelia virus, the causative agent of mousepox, binds chemokines through their GAG-binding domain. In addition, E163 interacts with GAGs to be anchored at the cell surface, but its ability to interfere with chemokine-GAG interactions has not been demonstrated. We report the identification of the GAG-binding regions in E163 and the generation of mutant forms deficient of GAG binding. Chemokine binding assays show that some of the E163 GAG-binding sites are also involved in the interaction with chemokines. By using recombinant GAG-binding mutant forms we demonstrate that E163 prevents the interaction of chemokines with cell-surface GAGs, providing mechanisms for the immunomodulatory activity of the viral chemokine-binding protein E163."

https://openalex.org/W2893419332,"We previously characterized a clonal olfactory placode-derived cell line (OP6) as a model system for studying odorant receptor (OR) choice, where individual OP6 cells, similar to olfactory sensory neurons in vivo, transcribe one allele (""monoallelic"") of one OR gene (""monogenic""). The OP6 cell line provides a unique opportunity to investigate intrinsic properties of OR regulation that cannot easily be investigated in vivo. First, whereas OR-expressing cells in vivo are post-mitotic, OP6 cells are immortalized, raising interesting questions about the stability of epigenetic states associated with OR selection/silencing as OP6 cells progress through the cell cycle. Second, OP6 cells have been isolated away from extrinsic developmental cues, and therefore, any long-term OR selection biases are likely to arise from intrinsic epigenetic states that persist in the absence of developmental context. In this study, we investigated OR re-selection frequency and selection biases within clonal OP6 cell populations. We found no evidence of OR stability through the cell cycle: our results were most consistent with OR re-selection events transpiring at least once per cell division, suggesting that chromatin states associated with OR selection in this system might not be maintained in the subsequent generation. In contrast, we found strong evidence for OR selection biases maintained over prolonged culturing across a diverse set of OP6 cell lineages, suggesting the persistence of intrinsic epigenetic states that advantage some OR loci over others. Together, our data suggest that in the absence of instructive cues, intrinsic epigenetic states influencing OR eligibility, but not those determining OR choice, might persist through the cell cycle."
