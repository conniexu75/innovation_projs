https://openalex.org/W4223938176,"In primates, the amnion emerges through cavitation of the epiblast during implantation, whereas in other species it does so later at gastrulation by the folding of the ectoderm. How the mechanisms of amniogenesis diversified during evolution remains unknown. Unexpectedly, single-cell analysis of primate embryos uncovered two transcriptionally and temporally distinct amniogenesis waves. To study this, we employed the naive-to-primed transition of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to model peri-implantation epiblast development. Partially primed hPSCs transiently gained the ability to differentiate into cavitating epithelium that transcriptionally and morphologically matched the early amnion, whereas fully primed hPSCs produced cells resembling the late amnion instead, thus recapitulating the two independent differentiation waves. The early wave follows a trophectoderm-like pathway and encompasses cavitation, whereas the late wave resembles an ectoderm-like route during gastrulation. The discovery of two independent waves explains how amniogenesis through cavitation could emerge during evolution via duplication of the pre-existing trophectoderm program."

Research design and methods Retrospective data consisting of 27,292,879 patients from the Cerner Real-World Data were used. Odds ratios, overall and stratified by demographic predictors, were calculated to assess associations between COVID-19 and T1D. Odds ratios from multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for demographic and clinical predictors, were calculated to assess adjusted associations between COVID-19 and DKA. Multiple imputation with multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) was used to account for missing data. Results The odds of developing new-onset T1D significantly increased in patients with COVID-19 diagnosis (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.38, 1.46) compared to those without COVID-19. Risk varied by demographic groups, with the largest risk among pediatric patients ages 0–1 years (OR: 6.84, 95% CI: 2.75, 17.02) American Indian/Alaskan Natives (OR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.86, 2.82), Asian or Pacific Islanders (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.61, 2.53), older adult patients ages 51–65 years (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.66, 1.88), those living in the Northeast (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.61, 1.81), those living in the West (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.56, 1.74), and Black patients (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.47, 1.71). Among patients with diagnosed T1D at baseline (n = 55,359), 26.7% (n = 14,759) were diagnosed with COVID-19 over the study period. The odds of developing DKA for those with COVID-19 were significantly higher (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 2.04, 2.50) than those without COVID-19, and the largest risk was among patients with higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. Conclusions COVID-19 diagnosis is associated with significantly increased risk of new-onset T1D, and American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Black populations are disproportionately at risk. In patients with pre-existing T1D, the risk of developing DKA is significantly increased following COVID-19 diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W4224223934,"Despite the empirical literature demonstrating the efficacy of antidepressant medications for treatment of depression disorder, these medications' effect on patients' overall well-being and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) remains controversial. This study investigates the effect of antidepressant medication use on patient-reported HRQoL for patients who have depression.A comparative cohort, secondary database analysis was conducted using data from the United States' Medical Expenditures Panel Survey for patients who had depression. HRQoL was measured using the SF-12 and reported as physical and mental component summaries (PCS and MCS). A cohort of patients that used antidepressant medications were compared to a cohort of patients that did not. Univariate and multivariate difference-in-differences (D-I-D) analyses were used to assess the significance of the mean difference of change on the PCS and MCS from baseline to follow-up.On average, 17.5 million adults were diagnosed with depression disorder each year during the period 2005-2016. The majority were female (67.9%), a larger proportion of whom received antidepressant medications (60.5% vs. 51.5% of males). Although use of antidepressants was associated with some improvement on the MCS, D-I-D univariate analysis revealed no significant difference between the two cohorts in PCS (-0.35 vs. -0.34, p = 0.9595) or MCS (1.28 vs. 1.13, p = 0.6405). The multivariate D-I-D analyses ensured the robustness of these results.The real-world effect of using antidepressant medications does not continue to improve patients' HRQoL over time. Future studies should not only focus on the short-term effect of pharmacotherapy, it should rather investigate the long-term impact of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on these patients' HRQoL."

https://openalex.org/W4225482268,"For most of the COVID-19 pandemic, the daily focus has been on the number of cases, and secondarily, deaths. The most recent wave was caused by the omicron variant, first identified at the end of 2021 and the dominant variant through the first part of 2022. South Africa, one of the first countries to experience and report data regarding omicron (variant 21.K), reported far fewer deaths, even as the number of reported cases rapidly eclipsed previous peaks. However, as the omicron wave has progressed, time series show that it has been markedly different from prior waves. To more readily visualize the dynamics of cases and deaths, it is natural to plot deaths per million against cases per million. Unlike the time-series plots of cases or deaths that have become daily features of pandemic updates during the pandemic, which have time as the x-axis, in a plot of deaths vs. cases, time is implicit, and is indicated in relation to the starting point. Here we present and briefly examine such plots from a number of countries and from the world as a whole, illustrating how they summarize features of the pandemic in ways that illustrate how, in most places, the omicron wave is very different from those that came before. Code for generating these plots for any country is provided in an automatically updating GitHub repository."
https://openalex.org/W4226082669,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly deadly for residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. This paper analyzes COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes during the first wave of the pandemic in the United States during the spring and early summer 2020. By combining data on facility-level COVID-19 deaths during this period with data on the neighborhoods where nursing home staff reside for a sample of eighteen states, this paper finds that staff neighborhood characteristics were a large and significant predictor of COVID-19 nursing home deaths. Even after controlling for the county where a facility is located, one standard deviation increases in average staff neighborhood (Census tract) population density, public transportation use, and non-white share were associated with 1.3 (p &lt; .001), 1.4 (p &lt; .001), and 0.9 (p &lt; .001) additional deaths per 100 beds, respectively. These effects are larger than all facility management or quality variables, and larger than the effect of the nursing home’s own neighborhood characteristics. These results suggest COVID-19 outbreaks in staff communities can have large consequences for the facilities where they work, even in highly-rated facilities, and that disparities in nursing home outbreaks may be related to differences in the types of neighborhoods nursing home staff live in."

https://openalex.org/W4224214519,"Interdisciplinary research is the synergistic combination of two or more disciplines to achieve one research objective. Current research highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in science education, particularly between educational experts within a particular science discipline (discipline-based education researchers) and those who study human learning in a more general sense (learning scientists). However, this type of interdisciplinary research is not common and little empirical evidence exists that identifies barriers and possible solutions. We hosted a pre-conference workshop for Discipline-Based Educational Researchers and Learning Scientists designed to support interdisciplinary collaborations. We collected evidence during our workshop regarding barriers to interdisciplinary collaborations in science education, perceptions of perceived cohesion in participants' home university departments and professional communities, and the impact of our workshop on fostering new connections. Based on participants' responses, we identified three categories of barriers, Disciplinary Differences, Professional Integration, and Collaborative Practice. Using a post-conference survey, we found an inverse pattern in perceived cohesion to home departments compared to self-identified professional communities. Additionally, we found that after the workshop participants reported increased connections across disciplines. Our results provide empirical evidence regarding challenges to interdisciplinary research in science education and suggest that small professional development workshops have the potential for facilitating durable interdisciplinary networks where participants feel a sense of belonging not always available in their home departments."
https://openalex.org/W4224230263,"Depression is a serious and widespread mental health disorder. Although effective treatment does exist, a significant proportion of patients with depression fail to respond to antidepressant treatment trials, a condition named treatment-resistant depression. Efficient approach should be given this condition in order to revert the burden caused by depression. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are evidence-based health promotion instruments to improve diagnosis and treatment. CPGs recommendations for treatment-resistant depression must be trustworthy. The objective of the proposed study is to systematically identify, appraise the quality of CPGs for the treatment of depression and elaborate a synthesis of recommendations for treatment-resistant depression of CPGs considered to be of high quality and with high quality recommendations.We will search the databases of organizations, such as PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, and the Virtual Health Library, and organizations that develop CPGs. Three independent researchers will assess the quality of the CPGs and their recommendations using the AGREE II and AGREE-REX instruments, respectively. Given the identification of divergences and convergences as well as weak and strong points among high quality CPGs, our work may help developers, clinicians and eventually patients.No ethical approval is required for a systematic review, as no patient data will be used. The research results will be disseminated in conferences and submitted to a peer reviewed journal."
https://openalex.org/W4224264108,"The levels of psychological distress and burnout among healthcare staff are high, with negative implications for patient care. A growing body of evidence indicates that workplace programmes based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are effective for improving employees’ general psychological health. However, there is a paucity of research examining the specific psychological and/or behavioural processes through which workplace ACT programmes transmit their beneficial effects. The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to investigate the outcomes and putative processes of change in a 4-session ACT training programme designed to reduce psychological distress among healthcare staff (n = 98). Ninety-eight employees of a healthcare organisation were randomly allocated to the ACT intervention or to a waiting list control group. Study measures were administered on four occasions (baseline, mid-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up) over a three-month evaluation period. Results showed that the ACT intervention led to a significant decrease in symptoms of psychological distress and a less pronounced reduction in burnout. These effects were mediated primarily via an improvement in mindfulness skills and values-based behaviour and moderated by participants’ initial levels of distress. At four-week post-intervention, 48% of participants who received the ACT intervention showed reliable improvements in psychological distress, with just under half of the aforementioned improvements (46.15%) meeting criteria for clinically significant change. The results advance ACT as an effective stress management intervention for healthcare staff. The findings should be confirmed in a large scale randomised controlled trial with longer follow-up and cost-effectiveness analyses."
https://openalex.org/W4224250609,"The structure of food webs and carbon flow in aquatic ecosystems can be better understood by studying contributing factors such as the diets of herbivorous fish. Metabarcoding using a high-throughput sequencer has recently been used to clarify prey organisms of various fish except herbivorous fish. Since sequences of predator fish have dominated in sequences obtained by metabarcoding, we investigated a method for suppressing the amplification of fish DNA by using a blocking primer or peptide nucleic acid (PNA) clamp to determine the prey organisms of herbivorous fish. We designed three blocking primers and one PNA clamp that anneal to fish-specific sequences and examined how efficient they were in suppressing DNA amplification in various herbivorous fish. The results showed that the PNA clamp completely suppressed fish DNA amplification, and one of the blocking primers suppressed fish DNA amplification but less efficiently than the PNA clamp. Finally, we conducted metabarcoding using mock community samples as templates to determine whether the blocking primer or the PNA clamp was effective in suppressing fish DNA amplification. The results showed that the PNA clamp suppressed 99.3%-99.9% of fish DNA amplification, whereas the blocking primer suppressed 3.3%-32.9%. Therefore, we propose the application of the PNA clamp for clarifying the prey organisms and food preferences of various herbivorous fish."

A comprehensive summary of conditioning, coordinative and sports skill related training effects with Exergames in healthy adults is still missing. This contribution presents the protocol for a systematic review that aims to: a) summarize absolute and relative effects of training with Exergames on physical indicators and motivation compared to no or conventional training; b) identify possible mediators and moderators for varying training responses; c) identify gaps in the current evidence related to Exergame-based training."
https://openalex.org/W4224296207,"Background Human Papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal cancers have been on the rise in the past three decades. Dentists are uniquely positioned to discuss vaccination programs with their patients. The goal of this project was to assess the readiness of dentists in the state of Indiana in being able to administer vaccines. Methods An 18-question online survey was sent to licensed dentists in the state of Indiana. Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests, followed by multivariable analyses using ordinal logistic regression were conducted to assess providers’ comfort levels and willingness to administer vaccines in both children and adults, by provider characteristics (practice type, location, and years in practice). Results A total of 569 completed surveys were included for data analyses. Most dentists (58%) responded positively when asked if they would consider offering vaccinations in their office, if allowed by state legislation. In general, dentists working in academic settings and federally qualified health centers were more agreeable to offering vaccination in their practice. The level of agreement with “Dentists should be allowed to administer HPV, Influenza, Hep A and COVID 19 vaccines” for both children and adults decreased with increased years of practice. More than half of the respondents (55%) agreed that dental providers were competent to administer vaccines and needed no further training. Conclusion The study results suggest the willingness of dentists in the state of Indiana to offer vaccinations in their practices, if allowed by legislation. Practical implications Dental providers can be a unique resource to add to workforce for improving vaccination efforts."
https://openalex.org/W4224303853,"Palaeolithic stone plaquettes are a type of mobiliary art featuring engravings and recovered primarily from Magdalenian sites, where they can number from single finds to several thousand examples. Where context is available, they demonstrate complex traces of use, including surface refreshing, heating, and fragmentation. However, for plaquettes with limited or no archaeological context, research tends to gravitate toward their engraved surfaces. This paper focuses on 50 limestone plaquettes excavated by Peccadeau de l’Isle from Montastruc, a Magdalenian rockshelter site in southern France with limited archaeological context; a feature common to many art bearing sites excavated across the 19th and early 20th Centuries. Plaquette use at Montastruc was explored via a programme of microscopy, 3D modelling, colour enhancement using DStretch©, virtual reality (VR) modelling, and experimental archaeology, the latter focusing on limestone heating related to different functional and non-functional uses. While the limited archaeological context available ensures the results remain only indicative, the data generated suggests plaquettes from Montastruc were likely positioned in proximity to hearths during low ambient light conditions. The interaction of engraved stone and roving fire light made engraved forms appear dynamic and alive, suggesting this may have been important in their use. Human neurology is particularly attuned to interpreting shifting light and shadow as movement and identifying visually familiar forms in such varying light conditions through mechanisms such as pareidolic experience. This interpretation encourages a consideration of the possible conceptual connections between art made and experienced in similar circumstances, such as parietal art in dark cave environments. The toolset used to investigate the Montastruc assemblage may have application to other collections of plaquettes, particularly those with limited associated context."
https://openalex.org/W4225709889,"Successful fertilization depends on sperm motility adaptation. Ejaculated and activated sperm beat symmetrically in high frequency, move linearly, and swim with clockwise chirality. After capacitation, sperm beat asymmetrically with lower amplitude and a high lateral head excursion. This motility change called hyperactivation requires CatSper activation and an increase in intracellular Ca2+. However, whether CatSper-mediated Ca2+ influx participates in controlling the swim path chirality is unknown. In this study, we show that the clockwise path chirality is preserved in mouse sperm regardless of capacitation state but is lost in the sperm either lacking the entire CatSper channel or its Ca2+ sensor EFCAB9. Pharmacological inhibition of CatSper with either mibefradil or NNC 55-0396 leads to the same loss in swim path chirality. Exposure of sperm to the recombinant N-terminal part of the zona pellucida protein 2 randomizes chirality in capacitated cells, but not in non-capacitated ones. We conclude that Ca2+ sensitive regulation of CatSper activity orchestrates clockwise swim path chirality of sperm and any substantial change, such as the physiological stimulus of zona pellucida glycoproteins, results in a loss of chirality."
https://openalex.org/W4224297041,"Objective During the COVID-19 pandemic, the unemployment rate in the United States peaked at 14.8% in April 2020. We examined patterns in unemployment following this peak in counties with rapid increases in COVID-19 incidence. Method We used CDC aggregate county data to identify counties with rapid increases in COVID-19 incidence (rapid riser counties) during July 1–October 31, 2020. We used a linear regression model with fixed effect to calculate the change of unemployment rate difference in these counties, stratified by the county’s social vulnerability (an indicator compiled by CDC) in the two months before the rapid riser index month compared to the index month plus one month after the index month. Results Among the 585 (19% of U.S. counties) rapid riser counties identified, the unemployment rate gap between the most and least socially vulnerable counties widened by 0.40 percentage point (p&lt;0.01) after experiencing a rapid rise in COVID-19 incidence. Driving the gap were counties with lower socioeconomic status, with a higher percentage of people in racial and ethnic minority groups, and with limited English proficiency. Conclusion The widened unemployment gap after COVID-19 incidence rapid rise between the most and least socially vulnerable counties suggests that it may take longer for socially and economically disadvantaged communities to recover. Loss of income and benefits due to unemployment could hinder behaviors that prevent spread of COVID-19 (e.g., seeking healthcare) and could impede response efforts including testing and vaccination. Addressing the social needs within these vulnerable communities could help support public health response measures."
https://openalex.org/W4224299429,"Climate change is expected to exacerbate diarrhoea outbreaks across the developing world, most notably in Sub-Saharan countries such as South Africa. In South Africa, diseases related to diarrhoea outbreak is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. In this study, we modelled the impacts of climate change on diarrhoea with various machine learning (ML) methods to predict daily outbreak of diarrhoea cases in nine South African provinces.We applied two deep Learning DL techniques, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long-Short term Memory Networks (LSTMs); and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict daily diarrhoea cases over the different South African provinces by incorporating climate information. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) was used to generate synthetic data which was used to augment the available data-set. Furthermore, Relevance Estimation and Value Calibration (REVAC) was used to tune the parameters of the ML methods to optimize the accuracy of their predictions. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to investigate the contribution of the different climate factors to the diarrhoea prediction method.Our results showed that all three ML methods were appropriate for predicting daily diarrhoea cases with respect to the selected climate variables in each South African province. However, the level of accuracy for each method varied across different experiments, with the deep learning methods outperforming the SVM method. Among the deep learning techniques, the CNN method performed best when only real-world data-set was used, while the LSTM method outperformed the other methods when the real-world data-set was augmented with synthetic data. Across the provinces, the accuracy of all three ML methods improved by at least 30 percent when data augmentation was implemented. In addition, REVAC improved the accuracy of the CNN method by about 2.5% in each province. Our parameter sensitivity analysis revealed that the most influential climate variables to be considered when predicting outbreak of diarrhoea in South Africa were precipitation, humidity, evaporation and temperature conditions.Overall, experiments indicated that the prediction capacity of our DL methods (Convolutional Neural Networks) was found to be superior (with statistical significance) in terms of prediction accuracy across most provinces. This study's results have important implications for the development of automated early warning systems for diarrhoea (and related disease) outbreaks across the globe."
https://openalex.org/W4224226948,"The H3K4 demethylase KDM5B is overexpressed in multiple cancer types, and elevated expression levels of KDM5B is associated with decreased survival. However, the underlying mechanistic contribution of dysregulated expression of KDM5B and H3K4 demethylation in cancer is poorly understood. Our results show that loss of KDM5B in multiple types of cancer cells leads to increased proliferation and elevated expression of cancer stem cell markers. In addition, we observed enhanced tumor formation following KDM5B depletion in a subset of representative cancer cell lines. Our findings also support a role for KDM5B in regulating epigenetic plasticity, where loss of KDM5B in cancer cells with elevated KDM5B expression leads to alterations in activity of chromatin states, which facilitate activation or repression of alternative transcriptional programs. In addition, we define KDM5B-centric epigenetic and transcriptional patterns that support cancer cell plasticity, where KDM5B depleted cancer cells exhibit altered epigenetic and transcriptional profiles resembling a more primitive cellular state. This study also provides a resource for evaluating associations between alterations in epigenetic patterning upon depletion of KDM5B and gene expression in a diverse set of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W4224242006,"Introduction Long-term care engagement of women on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential to effective HIV public health measures. We sought to explore factors associated with a history of HIV treatment interruption among pregnant women living with HIV presenting to an antenatal clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study of pregnant women living with HIV who had a history of ART interruption presenting for antenatal care. Women were categorized as either retained in HIV treatment or reinitiating care after loss-to-follow up (LTFU). To understand factors associated with treatment interruption, we surveyed socio-demographic and partner relationship characteristics. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for factors associated with ART interruption were estimated using modified Poisson regression with robust variance. We additionally present patients’ reasons for ART interruption. Results We enrolled 541 pregnant women living with HIV (391 retained and 150 reinitiating). The median age was 30 years (interquartile range (IQR): 25–34). Factors associated with a history of LTFU were age &lt;30 years (aPR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.33–1.63), less than a primary school education (aPR 1.25; CI: 1.08–1.46), initiation of ART during pregnancy or breastfeeding (aPR 1.49, CI: 1.37–1.65), nondisclosure of HIV serostatus to their partner (aPR 1.39, CI: 1.24–1.58), lack of awareness of partner’s HIV status (aPR 1.41, CI: 1.27–1.60), and no contraception use at conception (aPR 1.60, CI 1.40–1.98). Access to care challenges were the most common reasons reported by women for treatment interruption (e.g., relocation, transport costs, or misplacing health documentation). Conclusions Interventions that simplify the ART clinic transfer process, facilitate partner disclosure, and provide counseling about the importance of lifelong ART beyond pregnancy and breastfeeding should be further evaluated for improving retention in ART treatment of women living with HIV in Malawi."
https://openalex.org/W4224242465,"Aim Portopulmonary hypertension (PoPH) is a rare and serious complication of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension that can interfere with liver transplantation (LT). We evaluated the prevalence of PoPH and the clinical features of right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), which is equivalent to pulmonary artery systolic pressure, in LT candidates. Methods This was a single-center retrospective study. A total of 157 Japanese patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis or portal hypertension (76 men, median age = 52 years [range: 18–68 years]) were enrolled. The relationships between RVSP and clinical parameters, and the prevalence of PoPH in LT candidates, were evaluated. Results The cardiological parameters were as follows: brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), 39.1 (4.0–780.5) pg/mL; RVSP, 31.2 (16.0–122.4) mmHg; ejection fraction, 58% (28–72%); and mean peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity, 2.3 (1.5–5.3) m/s. The RVSP was significantly higher in females ( p = 0.02) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) patients ( p = 0.01), and was weakly correlated with the BNP level (r = 0.40, p = 0.01). For RVSPs of &lt; 36 and ≥ 36 mmHg, the 5-year survival rates were 36.1% versus 34.1%, and 85.4% versus 85.3%, in non-LT and LT cases, respectively ( p = 0.47 and 0.69, respectively). Among six patients with an RVSP ≥ 50 mmHg, three (1.9%) were diagnosed with PoPH and treated with vasodilators. Conclusions PoPH was observed in 3 cases (1.9%) in 157 LT candidates. In patients with suspected mild pulmonary hypertension (RVSP, 36 - 50 mmHg), LT was successfully performed."
https://openalex.org/W4224256809,"Dynamical systems on graphs allow to describe multiple phenomena from different areas of Science. In particular, many complex systems in Ecology are studied by this approach. In this paper we analize the mathematical framework for the study of the structural stability of each stationary point, feasible or not, introducing a generalization for this concept, defined as Global Structural Stability . This approach would fit with the proper mathematical concept of structural stability, in which we find a full description of the complex dynamics on the phase space due to nonlinear dynamics. This fact can be analyzed as an informational field grounded in a global attractor whose structure can be completely characterized. These attractors are stable under perturbation and suppose the minimal structurally stable sets. We also study in detail, mathematically and computationally, the zones characterizing different levels of biodiversity in bipartite graphs describing mutualistic antagonistic systems of population dynamics. In particular, we investigate the dependence of the region of maximal biodiversity of a system on its connectivity matrix. On the other hand, as the network topology does not completely determine the robustness of the dynamics of a complex network, we study the correlation between structural stability and several graph measures. A systematic study on synthetic and biological graphs is presented, including 10 mutualistic networks of plants and seed-dispersal and 1000 random synthetic networks. We compare the role of centrality measures and modularity, concluding the importance of just cooperation strength among nodes when describing areas of maximal biodiversity. Indeed, we show that cooperation parameters are the central role for biodiversity while other measures act as secondary supporting functions."
https://openalex.org/W4224285449,"Group sizes of wild herbivores can be indicators of ecosystem health and proxies for individual and population fitness, particularly in areas where human activities have become increasingly common. We recorded 176 single- and multi-species groups of wild herbivores in human-dominated landscapes of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) during dry and wet seasons. We analyzed how wild herbivore group sizes were affected by: (1) season, (2) distance to fully protected area (NCA crater) and to streams, (3) distance to human settlements, and (4) numbers of livestock. Group sizes were generally larger during the wet season than during the dry season and varied seasonally with distance to NCA crater, streams, and human settlements. During the wet season, larger groups were observed further away from the NCA crater whereas the opposite pattern was apparent during the dry season. Average wild herbivore group sizes increased by about three-fold with increasing distance from the streams during the dry season but were invariant to streams during the wet season. Furthermore, during the dry season, group sizes were larger close to settlements but varied little with distance to settlements during the wet season. While livestock presence did not directly affect wild herbivore group size, distance to settlements, streams and distance to the Ngorongoro crater in interaction with rainfall seasonality did. We conclude that the NCA crater functions as a key resource area for wild herbivores such as wildebeest ( Connochaetes taurinus ) and zebra ( Equus quagga burchelli ) during the dry season, highlighting the need for its full protection status in this Man and Biosphere reserve."

Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a decision analysis model including Markov model for Multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB from the health system perspective. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per disability adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. Two-way sensitive analysis was done for the treatment success rate between MEMS and standard of care.The average total per-patient health system costs for treating a new TB patient under MEMS versus standard of care were $398.70 and $155.70, respectively. The MEMS strategy would reduce the number of drug-susceptible TB cases by 0.17 and MDR-TB cases by 0.01 per patient over five years. The ICER of MEMS was $434/DALY averted relative to standard of care, and was most susceptible to the TB treatment success rate of both strategies followed by the managing cost of MEMS.MEMS is considered cost-effective for managing infectious active TB in Morocco."
https://openalex.org/W4229364080,"Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) is a dominant regulator of whole-body glucose homeostasis. Accumulating evidence has shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play significant roles in the pathogenesis of disease. The aim of the present study was to identify the circRNA that can be used as a novel biomarker for type 2 diabetes (T2D) through regulating GLUT4. Based on previous microarray analysis comparing T2D cases and healthy controls, hsa_circ_0071336, which was predicted to be a regulator of GLUT4 by acting as a competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) to sponge miR-93-5p, was selected for further validation. The clinical significance of circulating hsa_circ_0071336 was investigated in a large independent cohort. The results showed that circulating hsa_circ_0071336 was significantly downregulated in blood in T2D and had a high diagnostic accuracy for discriminating T2D and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) from healthy controls. Low expression of circ_0071336 was an independent predictor of T2D, IFG and insulin resistance. A luciferase reporter assay and western-blot analysis indicated that miR-93-5p was a direct target of hsa_circ_0071336, and miR-93-5p may negatively regulate the expression of GLUT4. The expression levels of hsa_circ_007136 were negatively related to miR-93-5p expression and positively correlated with the mRNA expression of GLUT4 in adipose tissues. In conclusion, hsa_circRNA_0071336 can be considered as a potential novel and stable biomarker for T2D and its early detection. hsa_circ_0071336 regulates the GLUT4 expression by sponging miR-93-5p and maybe involved in the pathogenesis of T2D. These findings may unveil new targets for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of T2D."
https://openalex.org/W4224232088,"Centralized manufacturing and global supply chains have emerged as an efficient strategy for large-scale production of goods throughout the 20th century. However, while this system of production is highly efficient, it is not resilient. The COVID-19 pandemic has seen numerous supply chains fail to adapt to sudden changes in supply and demand, including those for goods critical to the pandemic response such as personal protective equipment. Here, we consider the production of the non-woven polypropylene filtration media used in face filtering respirators (FFRs). The FFR supply chain's reliance on non-woven media sourced from large, centralized manufacturing facilities led to a supply chain failure. In this study, we present an alternative manufacturing strategy that allows us to move towards a more distributed manufacturing practice that is both scalable and robust. Specifically, we demonstrate that a fiber production technique known as centrifugal melt spinning can be implemented with modified, commercially-available cotton candy machines to produce nano- and microscale non-woven fibers. We evaluate several post processing strategies to transform the produced material into viable filtration media and then characterize these materials by measuring filtration efficiency and breathability, comparing them against equivalent materials used in commercially-available FFRs. Additionally, we demonstrate that waste plastic can be processed with this technique, enabling the development of distributed recycling strategies to address the growing plastic waste crisis. Since this method can be employed at small scales, it allows for the development of an adaptable and rapidly deployable distributed manufacturing network for non-woven materials that is financially accessible to more people than is currently possible."
https://openalex.org/W4224239364,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is produced in the kidney by thick ascending limbs of the loop of Henle and by distal convoluted tubules (DCTs). Reduced urinary EGF levels have been associated with chronic kidney disease but it is not known whether physiological levels of EGF protect the kidney from progressive renal disease. Here, we show that EGF-deficient mice on a mixed genetic background had increased urinary microalbumin, and a subset of these mice developed severe progressive renal disease with azotemia that was not seen in WT or TGFα-deficient littermates with this mixed genetic background. These azotemic EGF-deficient mice developed crescentic glomerulonephritis linked to HB-EGF/EGFR hyperactivation in glomeruli, as well as attenuation of the proximal tubule brush border, distal convoluted tubule (DCT) dilatation, and kidney fibrosis associated with renal β-catenin/mTOR hyperactivation. The observation of these severe renal pathologies only in a subset of EGF-deficient mice suggests that independent segregation of strain-specific modifier alleles contributes to the severity of the renal abnormalities that only manifest when EGF is lacking. These findings link the lack of EGF to renal pathologies in the adult mammalian kidney, in support of a role of physiological levels of EGF for maintaining the function of glomeruli, proximal tubules, and DCTs. These observations suggest that diminished EGF levels predispose kidneys to progressive renal disease."
https://openalex.org/W4224260487,"Background Preterm birth remains the commonest cause of neonatal mortality, and morbidity representing one of the principal targets of neonatal health care. Ethiopia is one of the countries which shoulder the highest burden of preterm birth. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess factors associated with preterm birth at public hospitals in Sidama regional state. Methods Facility-based case-control study was conducted at public hospitals in Sidama regional state, from 1st June to 1st September/2020. In this study, a total of 135 cases and 270 controls have participated. To recruit cases and controls consecutive sampling methods and simple random sampling techniques were used respectively. Data were collected using pretested structured interviewer-administered questionnaire, and checklist via chart review. Data were entered using EpiData version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Independent variables with P-value &lt; 0.25 in the bivariate logistic regression were candidates for multivariable logistic regression analysis. Finally, statistical significance was declared at P-value &lt; 0.05. Results The response rate was 100%. Rural resident (AOR = 2.034; 95%CI: 1.242, 3.331), no antenatal care service utilization (AOR = 2.516; 95%CI: 1.406, 4.503), pregnancy-induced hypertension (AOR = 2.870; 95%CI: 1.519, 5.424), chronic medical problem during pregnancy (AOR = 2.507; 95%CI: 1.345, 4.676), urinary tract infections (AOR = 3.023; 95%CI: 1.657, 5.513), birth space less than 2 years (AOR = 3.029; 95%CI: 1.484, 6.179), and physical intimate violence (AOR = 2.876; 95%CI: 1.534, 5.393) were significantly associated with preterm birth. Conclusion Most of the risk factors of preterm birth were found to be modifiable. Community mobilization on physical violence during pregnancy and antenatal care follow-up are the ground for the prevention of preterm birth because attentive and critical antenatal care screening practice could early identify risk factors. Besides, information communication education about preterm birth prevention was recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4224278959,"Exercise and sport practitioners frequently utilize rating of perceived exertion (RPE) to evaluate the players’ psychophysiological strains during training sessions. The subjective rating of physical exertion level during sports training has been shown to have a reciprocal relationship with wellness status during periodic training or competitive seasons. However, the relationship between subjective physical exertions and wellness status during short-term overseas training camps (OTCs) has not been extensively investigated. This study aimed to examine the perceived responses of physical exertions [session-RPE (sRPE), training monotony, and training strain] and wellness status (fatigue, sleep, delayed onset muscle soreness, stress, and mood) measures in elite young adult futsal players from four separate OTCs with different training tasks. Twenty-seven U-20 male national team futsal players voluntarily participated in this study. The players recruited for OTCs were based on their performance during domestic training camps and the tactical demand of the team. The task of each OTCs was defined as: 1) 1 st OTC = game-based camp (n = 14); 2) 2 nd and 3 rd OTC = training-based camp (n = 20 and n = 17, respectively); and 3) 4 th OTC = pre-tournament camp (n = 14). The OTCs consisted of 11 training sessions (18.9 hours) and 16 friendly matches (23.8 hours). During daily training sessions and friendly matches, sRPE was used to quantify training load (TL). Additionally, a five-elements general wellness questionnaire was used to evaluate daily wellness status in the morning. The results demonstrated that the mean and sum sRPE in the game-based OTCs were significantly lower compared to the mean sRPE [ p &lt; 0.01, effect size (ES) = -4.8; p &lt; 0.01, ES = -2.9] and sum sRPE in the training-based OTCs ( p &lt; 0.01, ES = -3.6; p &lt; 0.01, ES = -3.1). The mean ( p = 0.01; ES = -2.0) and sum sRPE ( p &lt; 0.01; ES = -3.4) in the game-based OTC were also lower than that in the pre-tournament OTC. Conversely, the wellness scores in the game-based OTC were higher compared to the training-based ( p = 0.01; ES = 1.8) and the pre-tournament OTCs ( p &lt; 0.01; ES = 1.6). There was a negative relationship between mean and sum sRPE and all wellness scores (mean sRPE = r = -0.441 ~ -0.575, p &lt; 0.001; sum sRPE = r = -0.41 ~ -0.559, p &lt; 0.001). Our findings suggested that responses to training sessions, derived from mean and sum sRPE and wellness scores, are dependent upon the task-specific nature of OTCs among elite futsal players. Utilization of mean and sum sRPE and wellness measures to monitor the psychophysiological health during short-term OTCs is recommended."

Sustained increase in blood sugar levels (>150 mg/dL) confirmed the induction of diabetes. Histology and immunohistochemistry were used to identify changes in the retinal tissues in the diabetic rats indicative of the animals progressing into diabetic retinopathy. Gut mycobiomes generated using faecal DNA, indicated dysbiosis at the genus level in both diabetic (DM) and diabetic rats with retinal changes (DRC) when compared with the control rats. In Tables 3-6 the specific genera that were significantly increased/decreased in DM1 and DM2 and in DRC1 and DRC2 respectively compared to the respective controls CT1-CT4 rats are listed. Further, the mycobiomes of the DM and DRC rats separated into distinct clusters following heat-map analysis of the discriminating genera. In addition, β-diversity analysis separated the mycobiomes of DM and DRC rats from that of the control rats, but the mycobiomes of diabetic rats and diabetic rats with retinal changes showed an overlap. Based on the inferred functions of the discriminating genera in the mycobiomes, we speculated that increase in pathogenic fungi might contribute to the inflammatory status both in diabetic rats and rats showing retinal changes."
https://openalex.org/W4224214681,"The key to promoting the EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) model in China's public construction projects is to alter the path dependence of a project owner's choice of project delivery model (PDM). This study uses evolutionary game theory to discuss the mechanism of government incentives as an external motivation to alter path dependence in the PDM. In addition, a cellular automata simulation to examine the influence of various government incentives on the project owner's choice. The results show that the combination of subsidies and penalties can produce the best incentive. Subsidies are more effective at promoting PDM institutional change, whereas penalties are more effective at preventing PDM institutional change from anti-recession effects. Based on our results, we propose that the Chinese government should take active subsidy measures at the initial stage of EPC promotion, and adopt a dynamic incentive strategy of continuously reducing subsidies and increasing penalties according to the improvement of the development degree of EPC model."
https://openalex.org/W4224223629,"Art, as a prestigious cultural commodity, concerns aesthetic and monetary values, personal tastes, and social reputation in various social contexts—all of which are reflected in choices concerning our liking, or in other contexts, our actual willingness-to-pay for artworks. But, how do these different aspects interact in regard to the concept of social reputation and our private versus social selves, which appear to be essentially intervening, and potentially conflicting, factors driving choice? In our study, we investigated liking and willingness-to-pay choices using—in art research—a novel, forced-choice paradigm. Participants (N = 123) made choices from artwork-triplets presented with opposing artistic quality and monetary value-labeling, thereby creating ambiguous choice situations. Choices were made in either private or in social/public contexts, in which participants were made to believe that either art-pricing or art-making experts were watching their selections. A multi-method design with eye-tracking, neuroendocrinology (testosterone, cortisol), and motivational factors complemented the behavioral choice analysis. Results showed that artworks, of which participants were told were of high artistic value were more often liked and those of high monetary-value received more willingness-to-pay choices. However, while willingness-to-pay was significantly affected by the presumed observation of art-pricing experts, liking selections did not differ between private/public contexts. Liking choices, compared to willingness-to-pay, were also better predicted by eye movement patterns. Whereas, hormone levels had a stronger relation with monetary aspects (willingness-to-pay/ art-pricing expert). This was further confirmed by motivational factors representative for reputation seeking behavior. Our study points to an unexplored terrain highlighting the linkage of social reputation mechanisms and its impact on choice behavior with a ubiquitous commodity, art."

https://openalex.org/W4224242608,"Pertussis cases have been reported most frequently in developed countries, but they are predicted to be the most prevalent in developing countries. Indonesia, a developing country, routinely conducts case-based surveillance for pertussis. We reviewed the data on pertussis cases and close contacts based on clinical sample documents examined in the National Reference Laboratory for pertussis, Indonesia (2016–2020). Our objective was to analyze the laboratory and epidemiological aspects of pertussis cases and close contacts, particularly to evaluate the implementation of a 5-year case-based surveillance of pertussis in Indonesia. Data were collected from sample documents and annual laboratory reports between January 2016 and December 2020. We analyzed the proportion of pertussis cases and close contacts by geographic region, year, age, and sex. We used the χ 2 test to correlate the laboratory and epidemiological data. In total, 274 clinical cases of pertussis and 491 close contacts were recorded in 15 provinces. The peak number of cases occurred in 2019, with a positivity rate (percentage of laboratory-confirmed cases) of 41.23% (47/114). Clinical cases were dominated by infants aged &lt;1 year (55.5%), and 52.9% of them were aged &lt;6 months. Similarly, 72.3% (68/94) of the laboratory-confirmed cases were infants. Both clinical cases and positivity rates tended to be higher in females (155 cases, 38.1%) than in males (119 cases, 29.4%). No confirmed cases were found in children aged ≥10 years, although positive results still occurred in close contact. Age-group and laboratory-confirmed cases were correlated ( p = 0.00). Clinical and confirmed cases of pertussis occurred mostly in the early age group and may be lower in those aged ≥10 years, especially in confirmed cases. New policies are needed for pertussis prevention at an early age, as well as the application of serology tests to increase laboratory-confirmed cases in children aged ≥10 years."
https://openalex.org/W4224244035,"Staphylococcus aureus is a successful pathogen in hospital and community. Hemodialysis patients have high colonization rates. Interactions between them and their household contacts, are an opportunity to understand the S. aureus colonization between hospitals and community. This study aims to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of S. aureus colonization in hemodialysis patients and their household contacts, as well as the genetic relationship between their isolates.A cross-sectional study was conducted on hemodialysis patients from hospital-associated dialysis center in Medellín-Colombia, and their household contacts between 2019 and 2020. Colonization was assessed in the nostrils for household contacts and nostrils and skin around the catheter insertion for hemodialysis patients. Epidemiological information was obtained, and colonization was evaluated in their pets' oral cavities. Bacterial identification and susceptibility were assessed using phenotypic and molecular methods. Molecular typing included SCCmec typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), spa typing, and virulence factor detection.Colonization frequency was 35.6% (n = 16/45) in patients (87.5% MSSA- 12.5% MRSA) and 43.1% (n = 53/123) in household contacts (88.7% MSSA-11.3% MRSA). Of 45 homes, 77.8% presented colonized people. Colonization was detected in at least two household members in 46.7% of homes, of which 52.4% had a genetic relationship. Colonization was 16% (n = 4/25) in pets (75% MRSA-25% MSSA). The most frequent clonal complex was CC8 (15.6%), and the spa typing revealed high diversity.This study shows a high frequency of colonization by S. aureus in both hemodialysis patients and their household contacts and a significant genetic relationship between their isolates. This demonstrates an exchange of this bacterium and that homes are an important source of colonization to patients, highlighting the need for prevention strategies outside the hospital to avoid future infections, and the importance of the populations with permanent transit between the two environments."
https://openalex.org/W4224250150,"Background Opioid-related mortality continues to rise across North America, and mortality rates have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study sought to provide an updated picture of trends of opioid-related mortality for Ontario, Canada between January 2003 and December 2020, in relation to age and sex. Methods Using mortality data from the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario, we applied Bayesian Poisson regression to model age/sex mortality per 100,000 person-years, including random walks to flexibly capture age and time effects. Models were also used to explore how trends might continue into 2022, considering both pre- and post-COVID-19 courses. Results From 2003 to 2020, there were 11,633 opioid-related deaths in Ontario. A shift in the age distribution of mortality was observed, with the greatest mortality rates now among younger individuals. In 2003, mortality rates reached maximums at 5.5 deaths per 100,000 person-years (95% credible interval: 4.0–7.6) for males around age 44 and 2.2 deaths per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 1.5–3.2) for females around age 51. As of 2020, rates have reached maximums at 67.2 deaths per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 55.3–81.5) for males around age 35 and 16.8 deaths per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 12.8–22.0) for females around age 37. Our models estimate that opioid-related mortality among the younger population will continue to grow, and that current conditions could lead to male mortality rates that are more than quadruple those of pre-pandemic estimations. Conclusions This analysis may inform a refocusing of public health strategy for reducing rising rates of opioid-related mortality, including effectively reaching both older and younger males, as well as young females, with health and social supports such as treatment and harm reduction measures."

There is a continuous need for soluble and active kinases for in-vitro drug discovery and structural biology purposes. Kinases remain challenging to express using Escherichia coli , the most widely utilized host for heterologous expression. In this work, four bacterial strains, BL21 (DE3), BL21 (DE3) pLysS, Rosetta, and Arctic Express, were chosen for parallel expression trials along with BL21 (DE3) complemented with folding chaperones DnaJ/K and GroEL/ES to compare their performance in producing soluble and active human kinases. Three representative diverse kinases were studied, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor kinase domain, Aurora Kinase A kinase domain, and Mitogen-activated protein Kinase Kinase. The genes encoding the kinases were subcloned into pET15b bacterial plasmid and transformed into the bacterial strains. Soluble kinase expression was tested using different IPTG concentrations (1–0.05 mM) at varying temperatures (37°C– 10°C) and induction times (3–24 hours). The optimum conditions for each kinase in all strains were then used for 1L large scale cultures from which each kinase was purified to compare yield, purity, oligomerization status, and activity. Although using specialized strains achieved improvements in yield and/or activity for the three kinases, none of the tested strains was universally superior, highlighting the individuality in kinase expression."

Given this scenario, the semen of bulls has become extremely marketable and an important aspect of the animal industry. This study aims to develop a hedonic model for the price of semen doses of dairy bulls based on the information from the main sellers of the product in the Brazilian market. The main findings reveal that there is an additional premium for proven bulls. Semen doses from Gir bulls proved to be more expensive, and the AI firm ALTA has a discount compared to the other firms. From the characteristics obtained in the tests, there is a premium only for the Predicted Transmitting Ability-Milk (volume). The most valued feature found is the dose being sexed, that is, the dose that guarantees the gestation of a female from its use. Semen doses from dead bulls has proved to be more expensive."

A DMD mouse model also displays a neuropsychiatric phenotype, including increased startle responses to threat which normalise when dystrophin is restored in the brain. We hypothesised that startle responses may also be increased in humans with DMD, which would have potential translational therapeutic implications. To investigate this, we first designed a novel discrimination fear-conditioning task and tested it in six healthy volunteers, followed by male DMD (n = 11) and Control (n = 9) participants aged 7–12 years. The aims of this methodological task development study were to: i) confirm the task efficacy; ii) optimise data processing procedures; iii) determine the most appropriate outcome measures. In the task, two neutral visual stimuli were presented: one ‘safe’ cue presented alone; one ‘threat’ cue paired with a threat stimulus (aversive noise) to enable conditioning of physiological startle responses (skin conductance response, SCR, and heart rate). Outcomes were the unconditioned physiological startle responses to the initial threat, and retention of conditioned responses in the absence of the threat stimulus. We present the protocol development and optimisation of data processing methods based on empirical data. We found that the task was effective in producing significantly higher physiological startle SCR in reinforced ‘threat’ trials compared to ‘safe’ trials ( P &lt; .001). Different data extraction methods were compared and optimised, and the optimal sampling window was derived empirically. SCR amplitude was the most effective physiological outcome measure when compared to SCR area and change in heart rate, with the best profile on data processing, the least variance, successful conditioned response retention ( P = .01) and reliability assessment in test-retest analysis ( rho = .86). The definition of this novel outcome will allow us to study this response in a DMD population."
https://openalex.org/W4225917201,"Evolutionary models of dyadic cooperation demonstrate that selection favors different strategies for reciprocity depending on opportunities to choose alternative partners. We propose that selection has favored mechanisms that estimate the extent to which others can switch partners and calibrate motivations to reciprocate and punish accordingly. These estimates should reflect default assumptions about relational mobility: the probability that individuals in one's social world will have the opportunity to form relationships with new partners. This prior probability can be updated by cues present in the immediate situation one is facing. The resulting estimate of a partner's outside options should serve as input to motivational systems regulating reciprocity: Higher estimates should down-regulate the use of sanctions to prevent defection by a current partner, and up-regulate efforts to attract better cooperative partners by curating one's own reputation and monitoring that of others. We tested this hypothesis using a Trust Game with Punishment (TGP), which provides continuous measures of reciprocity, defection, and punishment in response to defection. We measured each participant's perception of relational mobility in their real-world social ecology and experimentally varied a cue to partner switching. Moreover, the study was conducted in the US (n = 519) and Japan (n = 520): societies that are high versus low in relational mobility. Across conditions and societies, higher perceptions of relational mobility were associated with increased reciprocity and decreased punishment: i.e., those who thought that others have many opportunities to find new partners reciprocated more and punished less. The situational cue to partner switching was detected, but relational mobility in one's real social world regulated motivations to reciprocate and punish, even in the experimental setting. The current research provides evidence that motivational systems are designed to estimate varying degrees of partner choice in one's social ecology and regulate reciprocal behaviors accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W4224210917,"Most realistic social communities are multi-profiled cross-communities constructed from users sharing commonalities that include adaptive social profile ingredients (i.e., natural adaptation to certain social traits). The most important types of such cross-communities are the densest holonic ones, because they exhibit many interesting properties. For example, such a cross-community can represent a portion of users, who share all the following traits: ethnicity, religion, neighbourhood, and age-range. The denser a multi-profiled cross-community is, the more granular and holonic it is and the greater the number of its members, whose interests are exhibited in the common interests of the entire cross-community. Moreover, the denser a cross-community is, the more specific and distinguishable its interests are (e.g., more distinguishable from other cross-communities). Unfortunately, methods that advocate the detection of granular multi-profiled cross-communities have been under-researched. Most current methods detect multi-profiled communities without consideration to their granularities. To overcome this, we introduce in this paper a novel methodology for detecting the smallest and most granular multi-profiled cross-community, to which an active user belongs. The methodology is implemented in a system called ID_CC. To improve the accuracy of detecting such cross-communities, we first uncover missing links in social networks. It is imperative for uncovering such missing links because they may contain valuable information (social characteristics commonalities, cross-memberships, etc.). We evaluated ID_CC by comparing it experimentally with eight methods. The results of the experiments revealed marked improvement."

In order to properly assess this risk, it is important to understand the factors influencing the persistence of Salmonella in poultry litter. This research was performed to investigate the influence of indigenous microflora on the survival of Salmonella Typhimurium in poultry litter. Microcosms of irradiated (sterilized) and natural poultry litter were inoculated with S . Typhimurium, adjusted to pH 8.0, 0.92 water activity (a w ), and stored at 30°C for 6 days. S . Typhimurium populations (log CFU g -1 ) declined in both litter treatments and there were no significant differences ( P &gt; 0.05) in recovery between litter treatments on any sampling days (0 to 6). The pH of the natural litter significantly increased ( P &lt; 0.05) from 8.42 on day 0 to 9.00 on day 6. By day 6, S . Typhimurium populations in both litter treatments fell below the limit of detection (1 log CFU g -1 ). The inactivation kinetics of S . Typhimurium in both litter treatments were described by the Weibull model. Under the experimental conditions (pH 8.0, 0.92 a w , 30°C), the presence or absence of poultry litter microflora did not significantly influence the survival of S . Typhimurium. This study demonstrates that the mere presence of poultry litter microflora will not inhibit Salmonella survival. Instead, inhibitory interactions between various microorganisms in litter and Salmonella are likely dependent on more favorable environmental conditions (e.g., a w , pH) for growth and competition."

The current study manipulated 8- to 11-year-old children's and young adults' mood using video clips (to induce a positive mood) or a psychosocial stressor (to induce a negative mood). Each participant then completed one session of a low-level visual learning task (visual texture paradigm). Using novel computational methods, we did not observe evidence for the modulation of visual perceptual learning by manipulations of emotional arousal or valence in either children or adults. The majority of results supported a model of perceptual learning that is overwhelmingly constrained to the task itself and independent from external factors such as variations in learners' affect."

https://openalex.org/W4224285641,"Between 2014 and 2019, unexpected mortalities were observed in a colony of Dryococelus australis , an endangered stick-insect kept at the Melbourne Zoo for a breeding and conservation program. Pure cultures of Serratia spp. were obtained from the haemolymph of moribund and recently deceased individuals. The combined bacteriological and histopathological observations suggested an infectious cause of these mortalities. Genotyping of Serratia sp. isolated from the insects and their environment revealed a predominant strain profile. A representative isolate, AM923, was entirely sequenced and compared to 616 publicly available Serratia spp. genomes, including 37 associated with insects. The genomes were distributed into 3 distinct groups, with 63% of the insect-associated isolates within a single clade (clade A) containing AM923, separated from most environmental/plant-associated strains (clade B) and human isolates (clade C). Average nucleotide identity and phylogenetic analyses identified AM923 as S . ureilytica and revealed similarities with putatively entomopathogenic strains. An experimental infection model in honey bees ( Apis mellifera) confirmed the pathogenic potential of AM923. A urease operon was found in most insect isolates and a PCR assay, based on the ure B gene sequence, was used to confirm the presence of AM923 in experimentally infected bees. This species-specific PCR could be applied to detect entomopathogenic Serratia spp. in infected insects or their environment."

Similarly, women often resort to assuming gender-neutral or male pseudonyms to increase their prospects in the publishing industry. This widespread gender inequality in the film and publishing industries raises the question of how writers’ gender relates to gendered language and narrative receptions. Two archival studies examined whether gender-linked language relates to film ( N = 521) and novel ( N = 150) ratings, and whether those associations differ as a function of writer gender or the expertise of the rater (professional critics and lay audience members). Results demonstrated that female screenwriters and novelists used a more feminine style of writing, whereas male screenwriters and novelists used a more masculine style of writing. Lay audiences gave more positive ratings to films and novels by writers who used a more gender-congruent writing style, in contrast with professional critics, who gave more positive reviews to films by writers who used a more gender-incongruent writing style. Our findings substantiate past research regarding the differing tastes of lay audiences and professional critics in addition to lending insight into subtle social dynamics that may sustain gender biases in the film and publishing industries."

However, its reported effects on primary motor cortex (M1) are limited. We aimed to better understand tUS effects in human M1 by performing tUS of the hand area of M1 (M1hand) during tonic muscle contraction of the index finger. Stimulation during muscle contraction was chosen because of the transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced phenomenon known as cortical silent period (cSP), in which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of M1hand involuntarily suppresses voluntary motor activity. Since cSP is widely considered an inhibitory phenomenon, it presents an ideal parallel for tUS, which has often been proposed to preferentially influence inhibitory interneurons. Recording electromyography (EMG) of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle, we investigated effects on muscle activity both during and after tUS. We found no change in FDI EMG activity concurrent with tUS stimulation. Using single-pulse TMS, we found no difference in M1 excitability before versus after sparsely repetitive tUS exposure. Using acoustic simulations in models made from structural MRI of the participants that matched the experimental setups, we estimated in-brain pressures and generated an estimate of cumulative tUS exposure experienced by M1hand for each subject. We were unable to find any correlation between cumulative M1hand exposure and M1 excitability change. We also present data that suggest a TMS-induced MEP always preceded a near-threshold cSP."
https://openalex.org/W4226064534,"The purpose of this study was to compare parameter estimates for the 2-compartment and diffusion kurtosis imaging models obtained from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression-controlled cells, and to look for biomarkers that indicate differences in the cell membrane water permeability. DWI was performed on AQP4-expressing and non-expressing cells and the signal was analyzed with the 2-compartment and diffusion kurtosis imaging models. For the 2-compartment model, the diffusion coefficients (D f , D s ) and volume fractions (F f , F s , F f = 1-F s ) of the fast and slow compartments were estimated. For the diffusion kurtosis imaging model, estimates of the diffusion kurtosis (K) and corrected diffusion coefficient (D) were obtained. For the 2-compartment model, D s and F s showed clear differences between AQP4-expressing and non-expressing cells. F s was also sensitive to cell density. There was no clear relationship with the cell type for the diffusion kurtosis imaging model parameters. Changes to cell membrane water permeability due to AQP4 expression affected DWI of cell suspensions. For the 2-compartment and diffusion kurtosis imaging models, D s was the parameter most sensitive to differences in AQP4 expression."
