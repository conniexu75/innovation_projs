However, the mechanism and time course of AIF redistribution to the nucleus is highly controversial. Because elevated intracellular calcium is one of the most ubiquitous features of neuronal cell death, this study tested the hypothesis that cleavage of AIF by the calcium-activated protease calpain mediates its release from mitochondria. Both precursor and mature forms of recombinant AIF were cleaved near the amino terminus by calpain I in vitro. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by truncated Bid induced cytochrome c release from isolated liver or brain mitochondria but only induced AIF release in the presence of active calpain. Enzymatic inhibition of calpain by calpeptin precluded AIF release, demonstrating that proteolytic activity was required for release. Calpeptin and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore antagonist cyclosporin A also inhibited calcium-induced AIF release from mouse liver mitochondria, implicating the involvement of an endogenous mitochondrial calpain in release of AIF during permeability transition. Cleavage of AIF directly decreased its association with pure lipid vesicles of mitochondrial inner membrane composition. Taken together, these results define a novel mechanism of AIF release involving calpain processing and identify a potential molecular checkpoint for cytoprotective interventions.

Neuronal cell death in acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders occurs by a variety of biochemical and morphological alterations that cannot always be classified into discrete pathways such as apoptosis and necrosis. Nevertheless, intracellular calcium deregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction are critical and ubiquitous mediators of neuronal demise (1Nicholls D.G. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 149-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Calpains comprise a class of intracellular cysteine proteases that are activated by calcium (see Ref. 2Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar for review). There are two ubiquitous forms, calpain I (μ-calpain) and calpain II (m-calpain) that are activated by micromolar and millimolar concentrations of Ca2+in vitro, respectively, as well as a number of tissue-specific isoforms. Several members of the Bcl-2 family of cell death regulators are processed by calpain (3Gil-Parrado S. Fernandez-Montalvan A. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Popp O. Bestvater F. Holloschi A. Knoch T.A.

Although the sequence specificity of calpain proteolysis is incompletely understood and may depend in large part on the tertiary structure of the target protein, some calpain substrates are distinguished by a PEST sequence rich in proline (P), glutamate (E) (or aspartate), and serine (S)/threonine (T) residues (6Rechsteiner M.

PEST sequences are suggested to promote susceptibility to digestion by calpain, and actual proteolysis often occurs elsewhere in the protein (e.g. as in cleavage of IκBα) (8Shumway S.D. Maki M.

AIF was suggested to play an essential role in calcium-mediated excitotoxicity initiated by N-methyl-d-aspartate stimulation of cultured neurons (10Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J.

Although AIF is nearly 4-fold larger in size than cytochrome c, translocation of AIF to the nucleus has been observed prior to the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c in several model systems of neuronal injury (17Cande C. Vahsen N. Garrido C. Kroemer G. Cell Death. Differ. 2004; 11: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Additionally, smaller forms of released AIF (50–65 kDa compared with ∼67 kDa migration behavior of the full-length mature protein) have been detected in vivo following transient focal ischemia (18Zhao H.

Paradoxically, AIF mediates caspase-independent forms of cell death despite the finding that in HeLa cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, AIF release from mitochondria during apoptosis appears to require active caspases (21Arnoult D.

Ameisen J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar).Treatment of isolated mitochondria with calcium, agents that promote oxidative stress, or various recombinant proteins is an approach frequently employed to examine the mechanistic underpinnings of the release of toxic proteins normally confined to the intermembrane space (23Polster B.M. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In this system, mitochondrial permeabilization by the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bid and Bax failed to reconstitute the AIF redistribution observed in cell and tissue models, although apoptogenic cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and Htra2/Omi were faithfully released (21Arnoult D. Gaume B. Karbowski M. Sharpe J.C. Cecconi F. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4385-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Multiple studies demonstrated that AIF is anchored to the outer face of the mitochondrial inner membrane, precluding its release following loss of outer membrane integrity (21Arnoult D. Gaume B.

Because release of AIF therefore requires detachment or removal of a domain required for this inner membrane association, we tested the hypothesis that proteolysis by calpain I induces AIF release from Bid-permeabilized liver or brain mitochondria. Pure lipid vesicles of mitochondrial inner membrane composition were employed to directly assess the effect of calpain on the ability of AIF to associate with phospholipids.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Recombinant human Bid was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Active caspase-2, -3, and -8 were purchased from Gene Therapy Systems (San Diego, CA). Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AFC) fluorogenic caspase-3 substrate was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Calpeptin was from Calbiochem. Percoll™ was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Active calpain I purified from human erythrocytes was obtained from Calbiochem and dialyzed into calpain storage buffer (125 mm KCl, 2 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) with 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Slide-A-Lyzer® mini-dialysis units (Pierce). Calpain I-specific activity was recalculated following dialysis by assessing the rate of cleavage of fluorogenic calpain-1 substrate (Calbiochem), and enzyme was stored in aliquots at –80 °C. AIF E-1 primary mouse monoclonal, Bid C-20 primary goat polyclonal, and His H-15 primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cytochrome c 7H8.2C12 primary mouse monoclonal antibody was from BD Pharmingen. AIF primary rabbit polyclonal antibody (AB16501) was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Liver phosphatidylcholine, liver phosphatidylethanolamine, and heart cardiolipin were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All other reagents were from Sigma.Preparation of Mitochondria—Adult (>6 weeks old) C57/B6 mouse and Wistar rat liver mitochondria were isolated by standard differential centrifugation as described previously (25Lapidus R.G. Sokolove P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Kristian T. Fiskum G. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 2004; 13: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Non-synaptosomal adult Wistar rat forebrain mitochondria were isolated and purified on a Percoll™ gradient as described by Kristian and Fiskum (26Kristian T. Fiskum G. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 2004; 13: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad Bradford method. Mitochondrial coupling was assessed polargraphically using a MIP-730 Dip-type O2 microelectrode (Microelectrodes, Inc., Bedford, NH) in a microcuvette (Hellma Cells, Inc., Plainview, NY) with a custom built airtight lid. Acceptor control ratios (ADP-stimulated state 3 rate to resting rate in the presence of oligomycin) for both liver and brain mitochondria were greater than 5 when measured as described previously (27Polster B.M. Basanez G. Young M. Suzuki M. Fiskum G. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Determination of Cytochrome c and AIF Release—Isolated liver or brain mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated at 30 °C for 30–60 min in 100 μl of KCl medium (125 mm KCl, 2 mm K2HPO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) supplemented with 5 mm succinate, 2 μm rotenone, 4 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, and 1 mm ADP. Succinate was used as a substrate in the presence of rotenone to maintain pyridine nucleotides in a reduced state. However, similar results were obtained with mitochondria respiring on complex I substrates (malate and glutamate, 5 mm each). Calpain I, CaCl2, ruthenium red, calpeptin, EGTA, cyclosporin A (CsA), reduced glutathione, Bid, and caspase-2, -3, and -8 were present in the incubation mixture as noted in the figure legends at the indicated concentrations. Mitochondrial suspensions were centrifuged at 13,400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C at the conclusion of the incubation period. Supernatants were stored with Halt Protease Inhibitor Mixture® (Pierce) at –80 °C. Pellets also stored at –80 °C were resuspended in 100 μl of KCl medium containing 1% Triton X-100 and Halt Protease Inhibitor Mixture® prior to gel loading. Proteins retained in the mitochondrial pellet or released into the supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE. AIF (1:500 anti-AIF), cytochrome c (1:2,000 anti-cytochrome c), and full-length Bid (1:500 anti-Bid) were detected by immunoblot as described previously (28Kushnareva Y.E. Polster B.M. Sokolove P.M. Kinnally K.W. Fiskum G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Generation of Recombinant His-tagged Proteins—PET 30a(+) plasmids (Novagen, San Diego, CA) containing a six-histidine (His) tag fused to either the full-length coding sequence for rat AIF or the coding sequence for the mature rat protein (which lacks the first 100 amino-terminal amino acids) were a generous gift from Drs. G. Cao and J. Chen (University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA). Plasmids encoding His-tagged proteins were transformed and amplified in Escherichia coli BL21pLysS. Protein expression was induced in 500 ml of bacterial cultures by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were disrupted by a 20-min incubation on ice in the presence of 10 μg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) and protease inhibitors, followed by sonication. His-tagged proteins were batch purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), washed, and eluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid used for the purification of His-BimEL lacking the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic tail was a kind gift from Dr. H.-G. Wang (University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, FL), and protein was purified as described (29Yamaguchi H. Wang H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41604-41612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Proteins were dialyzed into 125 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 at 4 °C using Slide-A-Lyzer® 10,000 molecular weight cut-off dialysis cassettes (Pierce) and stored at –80 °C.In Vitro Cleavage Assays—For the calpain cleavage assay, His-tagged precursor or mature AIF (10 ng/μl) was incubated with 1.25–5 units/ml of calpain I, 200 μm CaCl2, and 1.5 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Calpeptin or EGTA were also present when indicated. For the caspase cleavage assay, His-tagged proteins (10 ng/μl) were incubated with 50 units/ml of caspase-2, -3, or -8 for 4 h at 37 °C in 20 μl of KCl medium (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. All reactions were terminated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 10 min, protein was separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and proteolytic processing was assessed by immunoblot.Fluorogenic Caspase-3 Assay—Active caspase-3 was incubated at a concentration of 1.2 units/ml with 60 μm Ac-DEVD-AFC substrate in KCl medium (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm malate, 5 mm glutamate, 4 mm MgCl2,3mm ATP, 1 mm ADP, and 0.25 mm EGTA at 37 °C. Cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate was measured with a PerkinElmer LS50 B fluorimeter using excitation and emission wavelengths of 400 and 505 nm, respectively.Binding of AIF to Large Unilamellar Vesicles (LUV)—LUV were prepared as described previously, with slight modifications (30Terrones O.

Briefly, a lipid mixture emulating the phospholipid composition of the mitochondrial inner membrane of mouse liver (31Ardail D. Privat J.P. Egret-Charlier M. Levrat C. Lerme F. Louisot P. J. Biol.

After resuspension of dry lipid films in sucrose buffer (170 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0), samples were subjected to freeze/thawing and extrusion through two 0.2-μm pore size filters (Nucleopore, San Diego, CA). Sucrose-loaded LUV were then diluted 10-fold with iso-osmotic buffer (100 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0), and the liposome suspension was centrifuged at 185,000 × gmax for 1 h. The washing procedure was repeated two more times, and the final pellet was resuspended in iso-osmotic buffer. Sucrose-loaded LUV were incubated in iso-osmotic buffer with proteins as indicated. LUV were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation at 185,000 × gmax for 1 h, and protein contents of supernatant and pellet fractions were determined by SDS-PAGE (7.5% gels) and silver staining. Under these conditions, more than 85% of LUV precipitated to the bottom of the tube, as determined by phosphorus analysis of pellet and supernatant fractions (32Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSAIF Release from Isolated Liver or Brain Mitochondria Is Triggered by Calpain and Bid—To examine the ability of calpain I to cleave and release endogenous AIF from mitochondria, we initially used isolated mouse liver mitochondria as a model system because, in contrast to brain mitochondria, these mitochondria represent a homogenous population that is highly sensitive to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by Bid (Fig. 1). Respiring mitochondria were incubated under physiologically relevant concentrations of KCl, Mg2+, and adenine nucleotides, and the Ca2+ uptake inhibitor ruthenium red was included to enable Ca2+ activation of calpain without accumulation of calcium in the mitochondrial matrix. Although measured calcium concentrations as low as 2–3 μm were capable of activating purified calpain I (not shown) consistent with previous reports (2Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar), 200 μm added Ca2+ was employed in this study to overcome EGTA present in the calpain storage buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) and ensure maximal activation.Treatment of mouse liver mitochondria with calpain I (2.5 units/ml) induced slight release of cytochrome c and AIF that was inhibited by the specific calpain inhibitor calpeptin (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). Although full-length Bid (100 nm) induced essentially complete cytochrome c release from mitochondria (lane 4), indicative of outer membrane permeabilization, AIF redistribution was not detected. However, when mitochondria were treated with the same amount of active calpain I (2.5 units/ml) in the presence of Bid (100 nm), a dramatic enhancement of AIF release occurred compared with calpain treatment alone (compare lane 6 to lane 2). In contrast, co-incubation of Bid with caspase-8 (10 units/ml) or a combination of caspase-8 and caspase-2 or -3 (10 units/ml) led to little AIF release (lanes 9–11). Decreased immunodetection of full-length Bid (see Fig. 3) and cleavage of the fluorogenic caspase-3 substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC (Fig. 2B) confirmed caspase activity under the experimental conditions employed. AIF that was released into the supernatant migrated faster than AIF retained in the mitochondria (see Fig. 4B), suggesting that proteolytic processing had occurred.Fig. 2Active calpain I induces AIF release from Bid-permeabilized liver mitochondria.A, isolated mouse liver mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated with 200 μm Ca2+ and 1 μm ruthenium red for 30 min under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures”. Calpain (2.5 units/ml), caspase-2 (casp-2, 10 units/ml), caspase-3 (casp-3, 10 units/ml), caspase-8 (casp-8, 10 units/ml), calpeptin (calpep, 10 μm), and Bid (100 nm) were present in the incubation mixture where indicated. Reduced glutathione (2 mm) was also present to inhibit oxidation of cysteine proteases. In the lane denoted cBid (calpain-cleaved Bid) + calpain + calpep, Bid (100 nm) was preincubated with calpain I (2.5 units/ml) for 15 min prior to addition to the mitochondria, and the 30-min incubation of this mixture with mitochondria was performed in the presence of calpeptin (10 μm). Cytochrome c and AIF release were measured by immunoblot of supernatants following pelleting of the mitochondrial suspensions. Numbers indicate lane number. B, caspase-3 (1.2 units/ml) was added to medium containing 60 μm Ac-DEVD-AFC substrate under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” and cleavage was measured flourometrically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Active calpain I also induces AIF release from Bidpermeabilized brain mitochondria. Isolated rat brain mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated for 30 min as in Fig. 2. All treatments were identical to those described in Fig. 2 for mouse liver mitochondria, with the exception that 200 nm rather than 100 nm Bid was used. Cytochrome c and AIF release were measured in the supernatants as in Fig. 2, and the relative amount of full-length Bid in these supernatants following protease incubation was also measured.

Cyclosporin A (CsA, 1 μm) or calpeptin (calpep, 100 μm) were present where indicated. AIF and cytochrome c release were detected by immunoblot in the supernatant as described in Fig. 2.

Therefore, the ability of calpain to release AIF in the presence of Bid could be due to calpain-mediated enhancement of Bid-induced pore size, enabling AIF passage, or to increased access of calpain to the intermembrane space, enabling direct cleavage of AIF by calpain. To help distinguish between these possibilities, Bid was preincubated with calpain I to induce processing and this protein mixture was added to the mitochondria in the presence of calpeptin. In the presence of calpain I, but the absence of proteolytic activity, calpain-cleaved Bid failed to release AIF (Fig. 2A, lane 8), demonstrating that calpain activity downstream of Bid cleavage is required for AIF release.Because AIF has been implicated in neuronal cell death, we performed a similar experiment using isolated rat brain mitochondria to confirm the relevance of using liver mitochondria as a model system. As in liver mitochondria, calpain I alone (2.5 units/ml) induced slight AIF release (Fig. 3, lane 2). Treatment of brain mitochondria with unprocessed Bid (200 nm) failed to induce AIF release (Fig. 3, lane 5), as was the case for liver mitochondria (100 nm Bid, Fig. 2, lanes 4, 5, and 7). In contrast to mouse liver mitochondria, unprocessed Bid also failed to induce cytochrome c release (Fig. 3, lane 5). Activation of Bid by co-incubation with calpain I (2.5 units/ml, lane 4) or caspase-8 (10 units/ml, lane 7) led to cytochrome c release. AIF release, however, occurred only in the presence of Bid and calpain I (lane 4). As in liver mitochondria, Bid that was precleaved with calpain I (calpain-cleaved Bid) failed to release AIF in the absence of calpain activity (lane 6). An immunoblot for Bid confirmed that full-length Bid was proteolyzed to a similar extent in both cases (compare lanes 4 and 6 to lane 5) and that Bid was also cleaved by caspase-8 (lane 7).Calcium-induced AIF Release from Mouse Liver Mitochondria Requires Calpain—To determine whethe"

Specific Cys residues of various other proteins are also oxidized to sulfinic acid, suggesting that formation of Cys-SO2H might be a novel posttranslational modification that contributes to regulation of protein function. To examine the susceptibility of sulfinic forms of proteins to reduction by Srx, we prepared such forms of all six mammalian Prx isoforms and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Purified sulfiredoxin reduced the sulfinic forms of the four 2-Cys members (Prx I to Prx IV) of the Prx family in vitro, but it did not affect those of Prx V, Prx VI, or GAPDH. Furthermore, Srx bound specifically to the four 2-Cys Prxs in vitro and in cells. Sulfinic forms of Prx I and Prx II, but not of Prx VI or GAPDH, present in H2O2-treated A549 cells were gradually reduced after removal of H2O2; overexpression of Srx increased the rate of the reduction of Prx I and Prx II but did not induce that of Prx VI or GAPDH. These results suggest that reduction of Cys-SO2H by Srx is specific to 2-Cys Prx isoforms. For proteins such as Prx VI and GAPDH, sulfinic acid formation might be an irreversible process that causes protein damage.

The sulfur atom of cysteine is able to assume several different oxidation states: the –2 state in the sulfhydryl group (–SH), the –1 state in disulfide (–S–S–), the 0 state in sulfenic acid (–SOH), the +2 state in sulfinic acid (–SO2H), and the +4 state in sulfonic acid (–SO3H). Reversible oxidation of cysteine to disulfide or sulfenic acid, both of which are readily reduced by thiols such as glutathione (GSH) 1The abbreviations used are: GSH, glutathione; Trx, thioredoxin; Prx, peroxiredoxin; DTT, dithiothreitol; Srx, sulfiredoxin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HA, hemagglutinin epitope; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization–time-of-flight; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution. 1The abbreviations used are: GSH, glutathione; Trx, thioredoxin; Prx, peroxiredoxin; DTT, dithiothreitol; Srx, sulfiredoxin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HA, hemagglutinin epitope; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization–time-of-flight; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution. and thioredoxin (Trx), is an important type of posttranslational modification that contributes to the regulation of protein function. Sulfinic and sulfonic oxidation states are also found in proteins. However, given that sulfinic and sulfonic acids were found not to be reduced by biological thiols under physiological conditions (1Jacob C. Holme A.L. Fry F.H. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2004; 2: 1953-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the hyperoxidation reactions that give rise to these moieties were thought to be irreversible and to occur only under conditions of extreme oxidative stress or during protein isolation. The cysteine sulfinic acid produced during the catalytic cycle of peroxiredoxins (Prxs) was nevertheless recently found to be reducible in cells (2Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W.

All Prx enzymes contain a conserved Cys residue in the NH2-terminal portion of the molecule, and most contain an additional conserved Cys in the COOH-terminal region. Prx enzymes exist as homodimers, with the two monomers arranged in a head-to-tail manner, and the dimers are able to aggregate further to form decamers (9Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells express six isoforms of Prx (Prx I to VI), which are classified into three subgroups (2-Cys, atypical 2-Cys, and 1-Cys) on the basis of the number and position of Cys residues that participate in catalysis (8Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Prx I to Prx IV belong to the 2-Cys Prx subgroup, Prx V to the atypical 2-Cys subgroup, and Prx VI to the 1-Cys subgroup. Prx I to Prx IV thus possess the conserved NH2-terminal Cys (N-Cys) and a COOH-terminal Cys (C-Cys) that are separated by 121 amino acids. During catalysis, peroxides oxidize N-Cys–SH to sulfenic acid, which then reacts with C-Cys–SH of the other subunit to form an intermolecular disulfide. This disulfide is subsequently reduced specifically by Trx. The N-Cys–SH is also the site of oxidation by peroxides in Prx V and Prx VI, neither of which contains a C-Cys. The resulting sulfenic acid of Prx V forms an intramolecular disulfide with a Cys–SH that is separated from N-Cys by 104 amino acids, and the disulfide is reduced by Trx. In the case of Prx VI, the sulfenic acid does not form a disulfide because of the unavailability of another Cys–SH nearby; it can be reduced by nonphysiological thiols such as dithiothreitol (DTT) but not by Trx or GSH.Studies with 2-Cys Prxs, mainly Prx I, have indicated that the N-Cys–SOH intermediate is occasionally further oxidized to sulfinic acid before it is able to form a disulfide with C-Cys–SH, resulting in inactivation of peroxidase activity (10Chae H.Z.

Indeed, 1.4% of the Cys residues of soluble proteins in rat liver were detected as sulfinic acid, whereas sulfonic acid was not detected (17Hamann M. Zhang T. Hendrich S. Thomas J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cycle of thiol to sulfinic acid might thus represent a redox switch by which the function of a wide variety of proteins is regulated in response to a change in intracellular redox status. The operation of such a thiol-sulfinic switch would appear to require the existence of sulfinic reductases of broad specificity. We have examined the ability of Srx to catalyze the reduction of various sulfinic proteins, and we now show that Srx appears to act specifically in reduction of the sulfinic acid groups of 2-Cys Prx proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Preparation of recombinant human Prx I, III, IV, V, and VI (18Kang S.W.

Mouse monoclonal antibodies to β-actin, to the hemagglutinin epitope (HA), to GAPDH, or to glutathione S-transferase (GST) were obtained from Abcam, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Chemicon International, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Rabbit muscle GAPDH was from Sigma. Prx II was purified from outdated human erythrocytes as described (24Kristensen P. Rasmussen D.E. Kristensen B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Preparation of Sulfinic Proteins—Human 2-Cys Prxs (Prx I to IV) were oxidized in the presence of H2O2 (1 mm), human Trx1, and DTT as described previously for Prx I (2Woo H.A.

A similar procedure was followed for the preparation of sulfinic forms of Prx V with the exception that the concentration of H2O2 was increased to 3 mm for Prx V. Recombinant human Prx VI (250 μg) or rabbit muscle GAPDH (250 μg) was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in a 250-μl reaction mixture containing 4 mm H2O2 and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The sulfinic state of the oxidized proteins was verified by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) as described (2Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Rhee S.G.

Liu, NIA, National Institutes of Health) or the XbaI and BamHI sites of pCGN (kindly provided by W. Herr, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) for the expression of a GST-Srx fusion protein or HA-tagged Srx, respectively. Cells were transfected with these vectors with the use of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science).RESULTSSrx Reduces the Cys Sulfinic Acid of 2-Cys Prx Enzymes but Not That of Atypical 2-Cys Prx, 1-Cys Prx, or GAPDH in Vitro— Sulfinic forms of the six human Prx isozymes (Prx I to VI) were prepared, and their sulfinic oxidation state was verified by ESI-MS (data not shown). They were then incubated with Srx in the presence of MgCl2 and ATP, and the resulting assay mixtures were subjected to two-dimensional PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1). Sulfinic Prxs are detected at a more acidic position than are the corresponding reduced proteins because of the presence of the negatively charged sulfinic group. Although the rates of reduction differed, Srx gradually regenerated the reduced forms of the four 2-Cys Prxs. Srx failed to reduce the sulfinic forms of Prx V and Prx VI, however. Similar results were obtained when the regeneration of the reduced enzymes was monitored on the basis of recovery of Trx-dependent peroxidase activity (data not shown). To confirm the different reactivities of Prxs with Srx, we incubated a mixture of the sufinic forms of Prx I, Prx III, and Prx VI with Srx. The two-dimensional analysis of the reaction mixture confirmed that Prx I and Prx III, but not Prx VI, were substrates of Srx (data not shown).We also prepared sulfinic forms of rabbit muscle GAPDH. GAPDH contains four Cys residues, among which the catalytic site Cys149–SH, which is activated by the proton-extracting residue His176, is sensitive to oxidation. Incorporation of two oxygen atoms into Tsa1 and GAPDH during oxidation was detected by ESI-MS. Specific oxidation of Cys149 of GAPDH was revealed by collision-induced dissociation-tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides (data not shown). We have previously developed a procedure to monitor the reduction of sulfinic 2-Cys Prx enzymes by immunoblot analysis (after one-dimensional PAGE) with antibodies (anti-2-Cys Prx-SO2) that specifically recognize both sufinic and sulfonic forms of these proteins. We also produced anti-Prx V-SO2, anti-Prx VI-SO2, and anti-GAPDH-SO2 antibodies. The specificity of these antibodies was apparent from the observation that they detected oxidized (sulfinic) forms but not nonoxidized forms of the corresponding target proteins in immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2). The reduction of the sulfinic forms of Prx I, Prx V, Prx VI, and GAPDH was examined by immunoblot analysis with the corresponding antibodies specific for the hyperoxidized state (Fig. 2). Consistent with the results obtained by two-dimensional analysis, the immunoblot intensity of the Prx I band detected by anti-2-Cys Prx-SO2 gradually decreased with time of incubation with Srx, whereas that of the band detected with antibodies to Prx I remained unchanged (Fig. 2). In contrast, the band intensities of oxidized Prx V, Prx VI, and GAPDH revealed by the corresponding antibodies to the hyperoxidized state remained unchanged during incubation with Srx. These data indicated that the reduction reaction catalyzed by mammalian Srx is specific to mammalian 2-Cys Prx enzymes.Fig. 2Substrate specificity of mammalian Srx for sulfinylated proteins. Sulfinic forms of Prx I, Prx V, Prx VI, or GAPDH (5 μm concentration of each) were incubated for the indicated times in a reaction mixture containing 1 μm rat Srx, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm creatine phosphate, creatine phosphokinase (25 milliunits/ml), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 5 mm GSH. The oxidation state of each protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for the sulfinic forms of 2-Cys Prxs, Prx V, Prx VI, or GAPDH, respectively. The blots were reprobed with antibodies to Prx I, Prx V, Prx VI, and GAPDH, respectively. Reduced forms (Re) of the proteins were similarly analyzed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Srx Binds to 2-Cys Prx Enzymes but Not to Atypical 2-Cys or 1-Cys Prxs—We expressed a GST fusion protein of human Srx (GST-Srx) in HeLa cells and precipitated the fusion protein from the lysates of H2O2-treated cells with GSH-agarose beads. Bead-bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and major bands corresponding to proteins that coprecipitated with GST-Srx were excised from the gel, subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin, and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (data not shown). All major bands, with the exception of that corresponding to a 50-kDa protein, were identified as Prx IV, GST-Mu, Prx III, Prx I, and Prx II (Fig. 3A). The 50-kDa band was found to be associated with GSH-agarose beads even when GST-Srx was not expressed in HeLa cells (data not shown). HeLa cells express all six mammalian Prx enzymes; the abundance of Prx I, Prx II, and Prx VI is in the range of 3–7 μg/mg of soluble protein and that of Prx III and Prx V is in the range of 0.3–0.5 μg/mg (8Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). However, only 2-Cys Prxs, not Prx V nor Prx VI, were found associated with GST-Srx.Fig. 3Identification of proteins that interact physically with Srx. A, HeLa cells grown in 100-mm dishes were transfected with an expression vector for GST-Srx and cultured for 24 h before treatment for 10 min with 100 μm H2O2 in 10 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). The cells were then washed with HBSS and disrupted in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml)). After centrifugation, the lysates were incubated with GSH-Sepharose resin for 30 min at room temperature. The resin was then isolated by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer, after which bead-bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Proteins identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry are indicated (right lane); molecular size standards are also shown (left lane). B, HeLa cells grown in 60-mm dishes were transfected with expression vectors for GST (Mock), GST-Srx (WT), or GST-Srx (C99S) and cultured for 24 h before incubation for 10 min with 4 ml of HBSS in the absence or presence of 100 μm H2O2. Proteins precipitated with GSH-Sepharose as described for A were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to (α-) each of the six mammalian isoforms of Prx. C, yeast strain EGY48 was sequentially transformed with the p8op lacZ reporter plasmid, a pLexA bait plasmid for human Srx, and a pB42AD prey plasmid for Prx I to Prx VI. Colonies resulting from each transformation were assayed by the X-Gal whole-plate method as described (35). The combination of pLexA/p53 and pB42AD/T (Clontech) was used as a positive control (+), resulting in the formation of dark blue colonies, and the combination of pLexA/Srx and pB42AD was used as a negative control (–).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Human Srx contains a single Cys residue at position 99 that is essential for reductase activity and has been proposed to form a thiosulfinate with the sulfinic moiety of Prx during the catalytic cycle (5Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). To test whether the Srx-Prx interaction indeed involves Cys99, we constructed a mutant (C99S) of human Srx in which Cys99 is replaced by Ser. HeLa cells transfected with expression vectors for GST-Srx, GST-Srx(C99S), or GST alone were treated with H2O2, after which GST or the GST fusion proteins were precipitated from cell lysates. Immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with antibodies specific for each of the six mammalian Prx isoforms revealed that GST-hSrx interacted with Prx I, Prx II, Prx III, and Prx IV but not with Prx V or Prx VI (Fig. 3B). Mutation of Cys99 of Srx did not affect its association with the 2-Cys Prxs, indicating that the association does not involve the formation of either a disulfide or a thiosulfinate linkage between Srx and Prx. Furthermore, Srx appeared to interact with oxidized (sulfinic) and nonoxidized 2-Cys Prxs to similar extents, given that omission of H2O2 treatment of cells did not affect the association.We also examined the interaction between Srx and Prx with the yeast two-hybrid system. Yeast cells transformed with a bait plasmid for human Srx and prey plasmids for Prx I, Prx II, Prx III, or Prx IV grew on selective medium and the colonies stained blue for β-galactosidase activity, whereas those transformed with the Srx bait plasmid and prey plasmids for Prx V or Prx VI grew poorly on selective medium (Fig. 3C). These results thus provided further support for the notion that Srx interacts only with 2-Cys Prxs.Overexpression of Srx Promotes the Reduction of Sulfinic Forms of 2-Cys Prxs but Not That of Atypical 2-Cys Prx, 1-Cys Prx, or GAPDH—To study the specificity of Srx in cells, we transfected A549 human lung epithelial cells with an expression vector for HA-tagged human Srx or the corresponding empty vector (Fig. 4). We have previously shown that attachment of GST to or deletion of 16 amino acid residues from the NH2 terminus of human and rat Srx did not affect its reductase activity measured in vitro (22Chang T.S. Jeong W. Woo H.A. Lee S.M. Park S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50994-51001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were exposed to 1 mm H2O2 for 10 min to induce protein sulfinylation and were then incubated for various times in the absence of H2O2 but in the presence of cycloheximide. Cell lysates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-2-Cys Prx-SO2, anti-Prx VI-SO2, and anti-GAPDH-SO2 (Fig. 4). The band recognized by anti-2-Cys Prx-SO2 was broad or partially separated because the molecular sizes of Prx I, Prx II, and Prx III are similar. A gradual reduction of sulfinic 2-Cys Prxs was apparent in the control cells, and this rate was greatly increased in the cells expressing HA-Srx. Treatment of cells with H2O2 induced the sulfinylation of Prx VI and GAPDH; however, reduction of the sulfinic forms of Prx VI and GAPDH was not apparent either in control cells or in cells expressing HA-Srx. Prx IV and Prx V were not analyzed in these experiments because of their low concentrations in A549 cells. These results thus indicated that reduction by Srx is specific for 2-Cys Prx enzymes in cells.Fig. 4Effect of Srx overexpression on the reduction of sulfinic forms of 2-Cys Prxs, Prx VI, and GAPDH in A549 cells. Cells were subjected to transient transfection by electroporation with the Nucleofector instrument (Amaxa Biosystems) for 36 h with an expression vector for HA-tagged human Srx or with the corresponding empty vector (pCGN), after which cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to HA and to Srx (upper panels). The transfected cells were also exposed to 1 mm H2O2 for 10 min (0.16 h), washed with HBSS, and incubated for various times in F-12K medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). Cell lysates (20 μg) were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for the sulfinic forms of 2-Cys Prxs, Prx VI, or GAPDH as well as with antibodies to either Prx I, Prx II, Prx VI, or GAPDH. Times shown refer to the total times of incubation, including the 10-min exposure to H2O2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONOur results indicate that Srx specifically binds and reduces the sulfinic forms of 2-Cys Prx isoforms but not those of other proteins exemplified by atypical 2-Cys Prx, 1-Cys Prx, and GAPDH. The binding requires neither the sulfinic oxidation state of the substrate protein nor the active site Cys of Srx. Srx was first identified and characterized in yeast as a sulfinyl reductase for the oxidized 2-Cys Prx (5Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Human 2-Cys Prx isoforms share 60–80% sequence identity with each other, whereas the sequence identity between 2-Cys Prxs and either atypical 2-Cys Prx or 1-Cys Prx is ∼10 and 30%, respectively (8Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar).Hydrogen peroxide is produced as a result of normal cellular functions such as respiration as well as in response to exposure to radiation, light, and redox-active drugs. Although H2O2 itself is not especially reactive, it can be converted to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. All aerobic cells are therefore equipped with H2O2-removing enzymes, which include catalase, glutathione peroxidases, and Prxs. Stimulation of various cell surface receptors also induces the transient production of H2O2 (25Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Lee S-R. Kwon J. Science's STKE. 2000; 2000: pe1Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and cytosolic Prxs are implicated in the removal of such H2O2 (19Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G.

To investigate the relationship between sphingolipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, we utilized myriocin to inhibit mouse serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase (SPT), the key enzyme for sphingolipid biosynthesis. We injected 8-week-old apoE-deficient mice with myriocin (0.3 mg/kg/every other day, intraperitoneal) for 60 days. On a chow diet, myriocin treatment caused a significant decrease (50%) in liver SPT activity (p < 0.001), significant decreases in plasma sphingomyelin, ceramide, and sphingosine-1-phosphate levels (54, 32, and 73%, respectively) (p < 0.0001), and a significant increase in plasma phosphatidylcholine levels (91%) (p < 0.0001). Plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride levels demonstrated no significant changes, but there was a significant decrease in atherosclerotic lesion area (42% in root and 36% in en face assays) (p < 0.01). On a high fat diet, myriocin treatment caused marked decreases in plasma sphingomyelin, ceramide, and sphingosine-1-phosphate levels (59, 66, and 81%, respectively) (p < 0.0001), and a marked increase in plasma phosphatidylcholine levels (100%) (p < 0.0001). Total cholesterol and triglyceride demonstrated no significant changes, but there was a significant decrease in atherosclerotic lesion area (39% in root and 37% in en face assays) (p < 0.01). These results indicate that, apart from cholesterol levels, sphingolipids have an effect on atherosclerotic development and that SPT has proatherogenic properties. Thus, inhibition of SPT activity could be an alternative treatment for atherosclerosis.

Sphingolipids have many biological functions, including cell membrane formation, signal transduction, and lipid metabolism, and all of these may be related to the development of atherosclerosis.

Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). It has long been known that SPT plays an important role in the metabolism of sphingolipids, but its role in other lipid metabolisms and atherosclerosis has not been unequivocally determined. When SPT activity is increased in rat liver (2Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and lung (3Merrill A.H. Wang E. Stevens J. Brumley G.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 119: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), sphingolipid formation is likewise increased. The activity of SPT is heightened in the aortas of rabbits fed a high cholesterol diet (4Williams R.D. Sgrutas D.S. Zaatari G.S. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 763-770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Two candidate cDNAs for yeast SPT, termed LCB1 and LCB2, have been cloned (5Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7899-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The lack of SPT activity in a yeast strain defective in LCB1 or LCB2, together with the protein similarity data, suggest that the two genes encode subunits of SPT (6Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7899-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Mouse and human LCB1 and LCB2 cDNA homologues have also been cloned (7Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Gene. 1996; 177: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8Weiss B. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In mouse, the two mRNAs have the same tissue distribution (lung, kidney > brain > cartilage, skin > heart > liver > muscle), and the ratio of the amounts of the two transcripts remains approximately constant in all tissues (8Weiss B. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of LCB2 mRNA parallels the distribution of SPT activity (9Merill Jr., A.H. Nixon D.W. William R.D. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 617-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Isaria sinclairii is a fungus traditionally used in Chinese medicine in an effort to attain eternal youth (10Fujita T. Inoue K. Yamamoto S. Ikumoto T. Sasaki S. Toyama R. Chiba D. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1994; 47: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). From it, a specific SPT inhibitor named myriocin has been isolated (10Fujita T. Inoue K. Yamamoto S. Ikumoto T. Sasaki S. Toyama R. Chiba D. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1994; 47: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and proven to have a molecular structure similar to that of sphingosine (11Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Using myriocin-based affinity chromatography, two proteins, LCB1 and LCB2, can be purified from an interleukin-2-dependent mouse cytotoxic T cell line (CTLL-2) (12Chen J.K. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 221-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This result indicates that LCB1 and LCB2 are myriocin-binding proteins and confirms the fact that they are responsible for SPT activity (12Chen J.K. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 221-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).In this study, we utilized myriocin to investigate the impact of SPT inhibition on lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis development in the apoE-deficient mouse, a well known atherosclerosis animal model. We found that myriocin administration caused a decrease in plasma sphingomyelin (SM), ceramide (Cer), sphingosine (Sph), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels, caused an increase in plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels, and caused a decrease in atherosclerotic lesions in apoE knock-out (apoE KO) mice on both chow and high fat, high cholesterol diets.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Myriocin Treatment—Eight-week-old apoE KO mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Myriocin (0.3 mg/kg) (Biomol Research Laboratories Inc.) or phosphate-buffered saline was injected intraperitoneally every other day for 8 weeks. The animals were on Purina Rodent Chow (catalog number 5001) or a high fat, high cholesterol diet (20% milk fat and 0.15% cholesterol; Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI).Lipid and Lipoprotein Measurements—Fasting plasma was collected for fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) separation and lipid measurement. Total cholesterol, phospholipids and triglyceride in plasma, and lipoproteins were assayed by enzymatic methods (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Plasma sphingomyelin was measured as described previously (13Jiang X.C. Paultre F. Pearson T.A. Reed R.G. Francis C.K. Lin M. Berglund L. Tall A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2614-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). PC concentration was obtained by subtracting SM from total phospholipid concentration. Apolipoprotein analysis using SDS-PAGE was also done as described previously (14Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar).Sphingolipid Analysis by Mass Spectrometry—Plasma sphingosine bases, sphingoid base-1-phosphates, and ceramide species were performed on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in a multiple reaction monitoring, positive ionization mode at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, on a fee-for-service basis.Briefly, 250 μl of mouse plasma was fortified with the internal standards (IC17 base d-erythro-sphingosine (17C-Sph), C17 sphingosine-1-phosphate (17C-S1P), N-palmitoyl-d-erythro-C13 sphingosine (13C-Cer), and heptadecanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C17-Cer)) and extracted with ethyl acetate/iso-propanol/water (60:30:10) (v/v) solvent system. After evaporation and reconstitution in 100 μl of methanol, samples were injected onto the Surveyor/TSQ 7000 liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry system, and gradient was eluted from a BDS Hypersil C8, 150 × 3.2-mm, 3-μm particle size column with a 1 mm methanolic ammonium formate, 2 mm aqueous ammonium formate mobile phase system. Peaks corresponding to the target analytes and internal standards were collected and processed using the Xcalibur software system. Quantitative analysis was based on the calibration curves generated by spiking an artificial matrix with the known amounts of the target analyte synthetic standards and an equal amount of the internal standards. The target analyte/internal standard peak area ratios were plotted against analyte concentration. The target analyte/internal standard peak area ratios from the samples were similarly normalized to their respective internal standards and compared with the calibration curves using a linear regression model.Atherosclerosis—At the end of the myriocin treatment period, the mice were sacrificed, and the hearts and proximal aortas as well as the whole aortas were removed, dissected, and photographed. An aorta root assay and an en face assay were performed as described previously (15Jiang X.C. Qin S. Qiao C. Kawano K. Lin M. Skold A. Xiao X. Tall A.R. Nat.

A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSTwo groups of 8-week-old apoE KO mice were utilized. Group 1(n = 7) and group 2 (n = 7) animals were injected with 100 μl of myriocin (0.3 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline, respectively, every other day for 8 weeks. As expected, myriocin-treated mice had 50% less SPT activity in the liver than the controls.As shown in Table I, plasma SM levels were significantly decreased (54%) (p < 0.001) and plasma PC levels were significantly increased (91%) (p < 0.0001) after myriocin administration, whereas total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not significantly changed. It should be emphasized that the PC/SM ratio was dramatically increased (317%) (p < 0.0001) in the myriocin-treated group as compared with control, indicating that lipoprotein composition was changed.Table IPlasma lipid measurement after myriocin administration in apoE KO mice on a chow dietSMPCCholTGPC/SMmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlControl71 ± 8209 ± 23591 ± 7365 ± 172.9 ± 0.5Myriocin33 ± 3ap < 0.001, n = 7.399 ± 59ap < 0.001, n = 7.660 ± 10575 ± 1912.1 ± 0.2ap < 0.001, n = 7.a p < 0.001, n = 7. Open table in a new tab To investigate the lipid distribution among the lipoproteins with or without myriocin treatment, we utilized FPLC to fractionize lipoproteins and measured SM, PL, and cholesterol in each fraction. We found that myriocin significantly decreased SM and increased PC levels but had no significant effect on cholesterol (Fig. 1). SDS-PAGE revealed that there were no significant changes of the levels of apolipoproteins, including apoB100, apoB48, and apoA-I (data not shown).To investigate whether myriocin treatment has any impact on other sphingolipid levels, including Cer, Sph, and S1P, mass spectrometry was utilized. We found that after myriocin treatment Cer, Sph, and S1P were significantly decreased (Table II), indicating that myriocin treatment not only influences plasma SM levels but also those of Cer, Sph, and S1P, three important second messengers in signal transduction. The following two findings are also worth noting. 1) The major ceramides in apoE KO mouse plasma are Cer24:0, Cer24:1, Cer18:0, and C16:0 (Table II). 2) The S1P and Sph concentrations in apoE KO mice are ∼200 nm (Table II).Table IIPlasma sphingolipid measurement after myriocin administration in apoE KO mice on a chow dietC18:1CerC14CerC16CerC18CerC20CerC24CerC24:1CerDHSphDHSph-1PSphS1PnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmControl9 ± 210 ± 324 ± 287 ± 961 ± 82123 ± 2011461 ± 20927 ± 546 ± 12173 ± 21226 ± 50Myriocin2 ± 1ap < 0.01, n = 7.12 ± 2ap < 0.01, n = 7.11 ± 3ap < 0.01, n = 7.51 ± 8ap < 0.01, n = 7.35 ± 9ap < 0.01, n = 7.1321 ± 22ap < 0.01, n = 7.854 ± 144ap < 0.01, n = 7.30 ± 39 ± 5ap < 0.01, n = 7.127 ± 8ap < 0.01, n = 7.58 ± 9ap < 0.01, n = 7.a p < 0.01, n = 7. Open table in a new tab For further evaluation of the myriocin effect on plasma lipid levels, 2-month-old mice were challenged with a high fat, high cholesterol (Western type) diet for 8 weeks with or without myriocin treatment. As shown in Table III, plasma SM levels were dramatically decreased (59%), whereas plasma PC levels and the PC/SM ratio were dramatically increased (100% and 380%, respectively) (p < 0.0001) after myriocin administration. Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not significantly changed, with FPLC administration producing the same results (Fig. 2). Again, SDS-PAGE revealed that there were no significant changes of the levels of apolipoproteins, including apoB100, apoB48, and apoA-I (data not shown). We also measured other sphingolipid levels, finding that Cer, Sph, and S1P were dramatically decreased after myriocin treatment (Table IV). Basically, a profound myriocin effect was observed when a high fat, high cholesterol diet was used.Table IIIPlasma lipid measurement after myriocin administration in apoE KO mice on a high fat dietSMPCCholTGPC/SMmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlControl114 ± 11397 ± 931827 ± 30695 ± 193.5 ± 0.5Myriocin47 ± 14ap < 0.001, n = 7.795 ± 97ap < 0.001, n = 7.1807 ± 342107 ± 2716.9 ± 0.2ap < 0.001, n = 7.a p < 0.001, n = 7.

Open table in a new tab It is reported that myriocin treatment (1 mg/kg but not 0.3 mg/kg) reduces T-lymphocyte populations in mice (17Johnson V.J. He Q. Osuchowski M.F. Sharma R.P. Toxicology. 2004; 201: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We utilized FAS to evaluate myriocin effect on T cell counts in the circulation and did not found any difference (data not shown).To evaluate the effect of myriocin on atherogenesis, we dissected mouse aortas and photographed them. We also measured proximal and whole aortic lesion areas. After 2 months of myriocin administration on a chow diet, we found a reduction of lesions in the aortas (Fig. 3A). We also found a 42% (p < 0.01) reduction in mean proximal aortic lesion areas and a 36% (p < 0.01) reduction in mean whole aortic lesion areas compared with controls (Fig. 3, B and C). After 2 months of myriocin administration on a Western type diet, we also found a reduction of lesions in the aortas (Fig. 3A). There was a 39% (p < 0.01) reduction in mean proximal aortic lesion areas and a 37% (p < 0.01) reduction in mean whole aortic lesion areas compared with controls (Fig. 3, D and E). These results indicate that myriocin possesses important anti-atherosclerotic properties.Fig. 3Myriocin treatment dramatically reduced atherosclerosis in apoE KO aorta.A, mice were euthanized and the aortae dissected and photographed. This set of pictures is representative of seven sets. B and C, quantification of atherosclerotic lesions in the proximal aorta by root assay in mice fed a chow diet (B) or a high fat, high cholesterol diet (C).

The procedure for en face analysis was described previously (16Teupser D. Persky A.D. Breslow J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1907-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Values are mean ± S.D. *, p < 0.001; n = 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study we demonstrated for the first time that intraperitoneal myriocin administration in apoE KO mice caused the following: 1) dramatic decreases in plasma SM, Cer, S1P, and Sph levels; 2) dramatic increases in plasma PC levels, thus increasing the PC/SM ratio; and 3) significant decreases in atherosclerotic lesions.There are two methods of myriocin delivery in vivo, intraperitoneal injection and oral administration. Because the latter was shown to inflict serious gastrointestinal toxicity (18Fugita T. Yoneta M. Hirose R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5: 847-852Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and may have had an impact on cholesterol absorption during the high fat, high cholesterol loading experiment, we chose the former, as have other investigators (19He Q. Johnson V.J. Osuchowski M.F. Sharma R.P. Mycopathologia. 2004; 157: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Osuchowski M.F. Johnson V.J. He Q. Sharma R.P. Toxicol. Lett. 2004; 147: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Indeed, intraperitoneal injection of myriocin did not change mouse plasma cholesterol levels on the chow or high fat diets (Tables I and III). In a most recent report, Park et al. showed that oral myriocin administration causes significant reduction of plassma cholesterol and SM levels, thus causing a dramatic reduction of atherosclerotic lesions in apoE KO mice on a high cholesterol diet (21Park T.S. Panek R.L. Mueller S.B. Hanselman J.C. Rosebury W.S. Robertson A.W. Kindt E.K. Homan R. Karathanasis S.K. Rekhter M.D. Circulation. 2004; 110: 3465-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The different outcome of that study and ours, in terms of plasma cholesterol levels, might be due to the different methods of myriocin delivery.There was a profound induction of plasma PC levels after myriocin treatment (Tables I and III). This result was consistent with a previous report indicating that administration of l-cycloserine, another inhibitor of SPT, stimulated CTP:choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (CT; a key enzyme for PC biosynthesis) activity by 74% (22Mallampalli R.K. Mathur S.N. Warnock L.J. Salome R.G. Hunninghake G.W. Field F.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This effect might have been due to the decrease of Sph (Tables II and IV), a specific inhibitor of CT activity (23Sohal P.S. Cornell R.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).There is some question as to why myriocin treatment caused fewer atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-deficient mice. The decrease of SM and the increase of PC contents in non-HDL particles might be one of the mechanisms. Substantial evidence now supports the role of lipoprotein SM and arterial SMase in atherogenesis. SM carried into the arterial wall on atherogenic lipoproteins is acted on by an arterial wall SMase, leading to an increase in Cer content and promoting lipoprotein aggregation (24Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). LDL extracted from human atherosclerotic lesions is highly enriched in SM as compared with plasma LDL (25Hoff H.F. Morton R.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 545: 183-194Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Jeong T. Schissel S.L. Tabas I. Pownall H.J. Tall A.R. Jiang X.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, a significant fraction of LDL extracted from fresh human lesions is aggregated and has a high content of Cer, indicating that the LDL has been modified by SMase, resulting in aggregation (24Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The absolute and relative concentrations of plasma SM are both increased in atherosclerosis-susceptible animal models (26Jeong T. Schissel S.L. Tabas I. Pownall H.J. Tall A.R. Jiang X.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Miller M. Mead L.A. Kwiterovich P.O. Pearson T.A. Am. J.

Circulation. 1999; 100 (abstr.): I-695Google Scholar). In vitro manipulation has shown that the relative SM concentration is an important determinant of susceptibility to SMase-induced aggregation (24Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We have previously shown in a case-control study that plasma SM levels are an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (13Jiang X.C. Paultre F. Pearson T.A. Reed R.G. Francis C.K. Lin M. Berglund L. Tall A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2614-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and confirmed the result in another larger and more homogenous case-control trial. 2A. Schlitt and X.-C. Jiang, unpublished results.The decrease of plasma Cer levels might be another mechanism for the reduction of atherosclerosis in apoE KO mice after myriocin treatment. However, this hypothesis seems to controvert existing reports. Cer is a well known second messenger involving apoptosis (30Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Typically, strategies that elevate cellular Cer are used for therapies aimed at arresting growth or promoting apoptosis. Charles et al. found that Cer analogs, applied directly to damaged arteries, can be strongly antiproliferative (31Charles R. Sandirasegarane L. Yun J. Bourbon N. Wilson R. Rothstein R.P. Levison S.W. Kester M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Proliferation of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells appears to involve the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT kinase cascades and to be inhibited by Cer (32Bourbon N.A. Yun J. Berkey D. Wang Y. Kester M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1403-C1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, C6-Cer-coated balloon catheters prevent stretch-induced neointimal hyperplasia in rabbit carotid arteries (31Charles R. Sandirasegarane L. Yun J. Bourbon N. Wilson R. Rothstein R.P. Levison S.W. Kester M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) by inactivating ERK and AKT signaling and thereby inducing cell cycle arrest in stretch-injured vascular smooth muscle cells (31Charles R. Sandirasegarane L. Yun J. Bourbon N. Wilson R. Rothstein R.P. Levison S.W. Kester M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Based on published reports, we should expect more atherosclerotic lesions in myriocin-treated apoE KO mice than in controls, but we found the opposite (Fig. 3). The impact of plasma Cer levels on atherosclerosis deserves further investigation.The decrease of plasma S1P levels might be another mechanism for the reduction of atherosclerosis in apoE KO mice after myriocin treatment. In human plasma, 65% of S1P is associated with lipoproteins, where HDL is the major carrier (33Okajima F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). There is some debate as to whether plasma or serum S1P is an atherogenic or anti-atherogenic mediator. On the one hand, the S1P in HDL has been shown to bind to S1P/Edg receptors on human endothelial cells and, for this reason, probably mediates many of the anti-inflammatory actions of HDL on endothelial cells (34Kimura T. Sato K. Malchinkhuu E. Tomura H. Tamama K. Kuwabara A. Murakami M. Okajima F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). On the other hand, serum S1P was found to be a remarkably strong predictor of both the occurrence and the severity of coronary stenosis in a recent case-control study (35Deutschman D.H. Carstens J.S. Klepper R.L. Smith W.S. Page M.T. Young T.R. Gleason L.A. Nakajima N. Sabbadini R.A. Am. Heart J. 2003; 146: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the S1P concentration in apoE KO mice is >200 nm (Table II), and the amount needed to activate S1P receptors on endothelial cells is ∼100 nm (34Kimura T. Sato K. Malchinkhuu E. Tomura H. Tamama K. Kuwabara A. Murakami M. Okajima F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 36Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Yanagita M. Kuwabara A. Ui M. Okajima F. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Thus, the reduction of S1P to <100 nm by myriocin treatment (Table II) might have pathological relevance to atherosclerosis development in the mouse model. The impact of plasma S1P levels on atherosclerosis also deserves further investigation.It is reported that myriocin treatment (1 m"

The mechanisms underlying the alterations in Ca2+ sensitivity are unknown. Here we show that cytoplasmic ATP reversed Ca2+ sensitivity after desensitization, whereas mutations to putative ATP binding sites resulted in faster and more complete desensitization. Phorbol ester-induced activation of protein kinase C (PKC) increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of wild-type TRPM4 but not of two mutants mutated at putative PKC phosphorylation sites. Overexpression of a calmodulin mutant unable to bind Ca2+ dramatically reduced TRPM4 activation. We identified five Ca2+-calmodulin binding sites in TRPM4 and showed that deletion of any of the three C-terminal sites strongly impaired current activation by reducing Ca2+ sensitivity and shifting the voltage dependence of activation to very positive potentials. Thus, the Ca2+ sensitivity of TRPM4 is regulated by ATP, PKC-dependent phosphorylation, and calmodulin binding at the C terminus.

Ca2+-activated, Ca2+-impermeable nonselective cation channels that share functional properties with expressed TRPM4 (or the closest homologue, TRPM5) have been found in many excitable and non-excitable cells (Refs. 5Colquhoun D.

These nonselective channels may regulate important processes including cardiac rhythmicity and neural bursting activity, and their Ca2+-dependent activation has been suggested to form a general feedback control mechanism for Ca2+ influx in non-excitable cells. The functional analysis of TRPM4 and TRPM5 and their comparison with native nonselective cation channels are complicated by a peculiar property of these channels: when activated by an increase in free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), the currents decay rapidly due to a decrease in the sensitivity of the channels to Ca2+ (1Launay P.

Biol. 2003; 13: 1153-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies on TRPM4 exhibit an unusually large variability in reported values for Ca2+ sensitivity and activation time courses (1Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 2Nilius B. Prenen J. Voets T. Droogmans G. J. Physiol.

Most likely, these discrepancies reflect a highly regulated Ca2+ affinity of TRPM4, which may be of physiological relevance. Another puzzling property of TRPM4 is its sensitivity to ATP. We have shown recently that cytosolic ATP4– acts as a potent inhibitor of TRPM4 currents in inside-out patches, with half-maximal inhibition at ∼2 μm (3Nilius B. Prenen J. Voets T. Droogmans G. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 448: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, robust TRPM4 currents can be measured in the whole-cell mode, even under conditions in which the free cytosolic ATP4– concentration exceeds 100 μm. One possible explanation of this apparent paradox could be that ATP has both an inhibitory and a stimulatory effect on TRPM4, but experimental data to support this idea are currently lacking. In the present study, we investigated potential cellular factors that influence Ca2+-dependent activation of TRPM4. We report that the Ca2+ sensitivity of TRPM4 is regulated by cytosolic ATP, protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent phosphorylation, and calmodulin (CaM), and we identify distinct residues in the channel protein that are crucial for the modulation by these cellular factors. Cell Culture, Expression of TRPM4, and Mutagenesis—Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) human serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 2 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidity-controlled incubator with 10% CO2. For transient expression, we used the recombinant bicistronic expression plasmid pdiTRPM4b, which carries the entire protein-coding region for human TRPM4b (GenBank™ accession number AX443227; kindly provided by Drs. V. Flockerzi and U. Wissenbach) and for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) coupled by an internal ribosomal entry site sequence. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the pdiTRPM4b vector using methods described previously, and successfully transfected cells were visually identified by their green fluorescence in the patch clamp set up (for details, see ref. 4Nilius B.

For experiments with the dominant negative CaM mutant, CaM1,2,3,4, we used tetracycline-inducible HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-TRPM4, which were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine, as described previously (1Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The medium was supplemented with blasticidin (5 μg/ml; Invitrogen) and zeocin (0.4 mg/ml; Invitrogen). For all experiments, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Invitrogen) for 16–24 h and used after 16–20 h. Cells were kindly provided by Drs. J.-P. Kinnet and P. Launay (Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The CaM1,2,3,4 construct with the mutations of all four EF-hand Ca2+ binding sites was kindly provided by Dr. J. Adelman (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR). Single amino acid mutations were done by using the standard PCR overlap extension technique (18Prawitt D. Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Brixel L. Spangenberg C. Zabel B. Fleig A. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15166-15171Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A chimera containing the first intracellular linker of TRPM5 in the TRPM4 backbone was obtained using the overlap extension technique with human TrpM4 cDNA and mouse TrpM5 cDNA as templates; both were constructed in the pCAGGSM2/IresGFP vector (12Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The chimerical overlap PCR fragments were replaced in pCAGGSM2/TrpM4/IresGFP using AscI/ClaI restriction enzymes. The nucleotide sequences of all mutants were verified by sequencing of the corresponding cDNAs. Fig. 1 provides an overview of the mutants and constructs used in this study. CaM Binding Assay—Constructs for TRPM4 fragments fused to the C terminus of maltose-binding protein (MBP), in vitro synthesis of 35S-labeled MBP fusion proteins, and assay conditions for their binding to CaM were essentially the same as those described previously (13Zhang Z. Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3168-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 14Tang J.

Cell Surface Biotinylation Assay—In order to facilitate immunodetection of the expressed proteins, coding regions of TRPM4 and its C-terminal CaM site mutants were subcloned into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech). The resulting plasmids express TRPM4 and its mutants with GFP fused at the N termini. Transfection, biotinylation, and streptavidin precipitation were performed as described previously (15Wang C. Hu H.Z. Colton C.K. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37423-37430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using anti-GFP antibodies (Clontech). Sample loading for the crude cell lysate and streptavidin-precipitated portion represents 12 and 355 μg, respectively, of total proteins in cell lysates. Identical exposure time was used to reveal the chemiluminescent signals for the GFP fusion proteins in crude lysates and streptavidin-precipitated samples. Solutions—The extracellular solution for cell attached measurements and the pipette solution for inside-out patch clamp measurements contained 156 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2,10mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, buffered at pH 7.4 with NaOH. Before patch excision, the extracellular bath solution was changed to an “internal solution” for inside-out patch clamp, which contained 156 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 with CsOH. The Ca2+ concentration at the inner side of the membrane was adjusted between 100 nm and 10 μm by adding the appropriate amounts of CaCl2 calculated by the CaBuf program (ftp://ftp.cc.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/droogmans/cabuf.zip) to the 10 mm EGTA-containing solution. For Ca2+ concentrations between 100 μm and 10 mm, CaCl2 was added to an EGTA-free solution. In ATP-containing pipette solutions, we always used 4 mm Na2ATP. Mg2+ was added to obtain a free Mg2+ concentration of 500 μm, in which case the Mg-ATP concentration amounts to 3.6 mm. The extracellular solution for whole-cell measurements contained 156 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2,10mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, buffered at pH 7.4 with NaOH. The pipette solution contained 156 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2,10mm HEPES, and 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.2 with CsOH. Ca2+ concentration was adjusted between 100 nm and 100 μm by adding appropriate amounts of CaCl2. Recombinant CaM was added to the internal solution (bath solution) in inside-out patch clamp experiments at a concentration of 10 μm (diluted from a stock solution of 0.5 mm in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, and 5 mm KCl). Electrophysiology—Currents were monitored with an EPC-9 (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Patch electrodes had a DC resistance between 2 and 4 megaohms. An Ag-AgCl wire was used as a reference electrode. For whole-cell measurements, we used 400-ms ramps from –150 to +100 mV (sample interval, 800 μs; 512 points; 2-s interval between ramps; holding potential, 0 mV; series resistance compensation, 60–80%). For inside-out patches, the sampling interval was 500 μs, the interval between steps was 2 s (2048 points; filter setting, 1 kHz). Step protocols for single channel measurements were applied from holding potentials of 0 mV and consisted of 400-ms steps to –100 mV followed by a step to +100 mV. The interval between the pulses was 5 s. Experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Data Analysis—Electrophysiological data were analyzed using WinASCD software (G. Droogmans, Leuven, Belgium). Pooled data are given as the mean ± S.E. of n cells. Significance was tested using Student's unpaired t test (p < 0.05). ATP Restores the Ca2+ Sensitivity of TRPM4 after Desensitization—In all patch-clamp configurations, an increase in [Ca2+]i induced a fast activating, transient current in HEK293 cells that expressed TRPM4. Fig. 2A shows a typical time course of the whole-cell current activated by dialysis of a pipette solution that contained 10 μm [Ca2+]i but no ATP. The I-V curves obtained from the voltage ramps, measured at the times indicated by the solid points, display the typical rectification behavior of TRPM4 currents (1Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 4Nilius B. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Voets T. Vennekens R. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30813-30820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The current was almost completely abolished within 2 min of cell dialysis (Fig. 2, A and B). The same results were obtained when dialyzing the cells with 4 mm ATP and 0.5 mm free Mg2+ (Fig. 2B). In the inside-out configuration, currents measured in the absence of ATP also decayed rapidly to a stationary level. We have shown previously that this decay can be explained by an increased KdCa for Ca2+ binding to the channel (2Nilius B. Prenen J. Voets T. Droogmans G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 560: 753-765Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Exposure to a Ca2+-free solution completely abolished the currents. Subsequent application of Ca2+ restored the currents to a level that was nearly identical to that before exposure of the patch to the Ca2+-free solution (Fig. 2C). However, this recovery, as estimated from the current amplitude during reapplication of Ca2+ in the absence of ATP, was nearly complete if the Ca2+-free solution contained Mg-ATP. The latter currents were again followed by desensitization (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, ATP is able to restore Ca2+ sensitivity after desensitization. We have shown previously that free ATP4–, but not Mg-ATP, is an efficient blocker of TRPM4 channels (3Nilius B. Prenen J. Voets T. Droogmans G. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 448: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, ATP has a dual effect on TRPM4: its ionized form blocks the channel, whereas binding of ATP might have an effect on stabilizing or restoring the Ca2+ sensitivity of the channel. We have therefore explored the latter hypothesis in more detail. Direct Binding of ATP Is Important for Maintaining the Ca2+ Sensitivity of TRPM4—Multiple ATP binding sites, including Walker B motifs and ABC transporter signature motifs (16Orelle C. Dalmas O. Gros P. Di Pietro A. Jault J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47002-47008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Haraguchi M. Sumizawa T. Aoki S. Kobayashi M. Akiyama S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), can be predicted from the TRPM4 amino acid sequence (Fig. 1). In the N terminus, 231AFFLVD (WB1) and 273VLLL-LID (WB2) represent two Walker B motifs. An ABC transporter signature motif, 322GSSGGARQGEARDR, is located in the vicinity of WB1 and WB2. Two other predicted Walker B motifs are present in the first intracellular loop between TM2 and TM3, 800VLLVD (WB3) and 858LYLAD (WB4). They are again coupled to an ABC transporter motif, 833LSGGGGSLASSGG. Mutations of the WB2 site resulted in an extremely fast and more complete decay of the currents in inside-out patches, indicating that desensitization is accelerated. An example for the L275C mutation located in WB2 is given in Fig. 3A. The time course and the extent of the decay were quantified by the time constant (τ) and the apparent open probability in the “stationary” phase (Popen,ss), respectively. In comparison with the wild-type channel, τ was reduced by 50%, whereas Popen,ss was reduced by 95% for L275C (Fig. 3, A and B). The same result was obtained for L275A (Fig. 3B). Mutation of a neighboring negatively charged residue (Asp279) or a nonpolar residue (Ile278) to asparagine (D279N or I278N) did not affect the rate of decay or the stationary value (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the loss of the WB2 ATP binding site causes a more pronounced desensitization. Note that it was difficult to quantify the effects in many of these mutants (whole-cell as well as insideout conditions) due to the extremely fast current decay (∼10 s). In fact, whole-cell currents were hardly measurable. We have therefore focused experiments on inside-out patches. Next, we mutated the first ABC transporter signature motif, which is located in the vicinity of WB2. A single amino acid substitution in this region, G325A, again accelerated the decay and completely abolished currents within ∼10 s (Fig. 3, C and D). Mutation of neighboring residues, G324A and R327A, had no significant effect. To investigate the role of WB3 and WB4, which are co-localized with the second ABC transporter signature motif in the first intracellular linker between TM2 and TM3, we exchanged the TM2-TM3 of TRPM4 with that of TRPM5, which lacks these motifs. Note that TRPM5 is not sensitive to ATP and is not blocked by ATP4– (8Ullrich N.D. Voets T. Prenen J. Vennekens R. Talavera K. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3E shows that for wild-type TRPM4, the currents decayed to a stationary value after patch excision in 100 μm Ca2+. This decay is faster and more complete at negative potentials. The TRPM4/5 chimera that contained the TM2-TM3 linker of TRPM5 displayed an extremely fast and complete decay (Fig. 3F). Data are summarized in Fig. 3G. Thus, exchanging the TM2-TM3 linker of TRPM4 with a sequence that does not contain the Walker B and ABC motifs resulted in a highly significant acceleration of the decay, indicating a much faster loss of Ca2+ sensitivity (2Nilius B. Prenen J. Voets T. Droogmans G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 560: 753-765Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Obviously, all mutations predicted to affect ATP binding to the channel caused a very fast and complete decay of the Ca2+-activated currents of TRPM4. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3, H and I, all mutants and the TRPM4/5 chimera showed a strongly reduced recovery after Ca2+-free perfusion with 4 mm ATP and 0.5 mm free Mg2+ as compared with that of the wild type shown in Fig. 2D. PKC Phosphorylation Enhances the Ca2+ Sensitivity of TRPM4—The experiments described above indicate that ATP binding might be essential for channel functioning. Next, we tested whether phosphorylation could affect channel activation. TRPM4 contains multiple putative PKC phosphorylation sites. The predicted sites with the highest scores (NetPhos 2.0; www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/) were Ser1145 and Ser1152 in the C terminus and Thr68 and Thr356 in the N terminus (Fig. 1). First, we tested whether phosphorylation could modify channel activation. For this experiment, we dialyzed the cells with 1 μm Ca2+, which only caused activation of whole-cell currents through TRPM4 channels in a small fraction of cells both in the absence and presence of 4 mm ATP (3 of 12 cells). Fig. 4A shows an example of a responding cell, in which current activation was induced by 1 μm [Ca2+]i in the absence of ATP. The activated currents are small and lack the typical outward rectification pattern of TRPM4 currents. Fig. 4D shows the averaged current amplitudes. Next, we tested the role of PKC by applying phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Preincubation with 1 μm PMA for 1 h significantly increased the incidence of TRPM4 current activation by 1 μm Ca2+ (7 of 10 cells). The whole-cell current densities resulting from activation by 1 μm Ca2+ were also significantly increased by the PMA pretreatment (Fig. 4, B and D). The EC50 value for Ca2+, as measured from the peak currents in the presence of 4 mm ATP and at various Ca2+ concentrations, was 15 μm in control cells (Fig. 4C) compared with 4 μm in cells preincubated with PMA (Fig. 4, B and C). The effect of PMA was absent in cells expressing the mutants S1145A or S1152A (Fig. 4, C and D). These findings indicate that PKC-dependent phosphorylation increases the Ca2+ sensitivity of TRPM4. The nearly negligible effect of the presence and absence of ATP in the patch pipette may hint at the non-complete washout of ATP during ATP-free dialysis during the fast first peak of current activation. CaM Is Involved in Conferring the Ca2+ Sensitivity of TRPM4—Next, we tried to find the molecular determinant(s) that transfers Ca2+ sensitivity to TRPM4. We reasoned that either Ca2+ could bind and activate the channels directly or the activation could proceed via Ca2+ binding to an accessory Ca2+-binding protein such as CaM. To validate the second possibility, we have first studied on whole-cell currents the effect of overexpression of a dominant negative CaM mutant, CaM1,2,3,4, in which all four EF-hand Ca2+ binding sites are mutated. These experiments were performed in an inducible, hTRPM4-expressing HEK293 cell line (1Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 3Nilius B. Prenen J. Voets T. Droogmans G. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 448: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Transient expression of CaM1,2,3,4 in these cells resulted in a drastic decrease of the current amplitude (Fig. 5, A and B), although some TRPM4 activity was still detectable (Fig. 5C). These data suggest that CaM may be involved in regulating TRPM4 activation. In a second approach, we added recombinant CaM to the Ca2+-containing solution in which the inside-out patches were excised (100 μm Ca2+ and 10 μm CaM). Desensitization was also seen in the presence of CaM (Fig. 5, D and E). However, the ratio between inward current at –100 mV and +100 mV was increased, and current decay was less pronounced than in the absence of CaM (Fig. 5, F–H). These data indicate that in cell-free patches, CaM reduced desensitization of TRPM4. We then searched for CaM-binding sites on TRPM4 using in vitro binding assays. Fragments of TRPM4 were fused to MBP and prepared by in vitro synthesis using transcription and translation-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys. The 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with CaM-Sepharose in a binding solution that contained 1 mm Ca2+. The MBP fusion proteins retained by CaM-Sepharose were considered positive and were further divided into smaller segments until the minimal binding region was obtained. The diagram in Fig. 6A summarizes the results, with the filled, hatched, and open bars indicating positive, weakly positive, and negative binding to Ca2+-CaM, respectively. Examples of the binding results are shown in Fig. 6B. Semiquantitatively, the darker the band, the stronger the binding of the fragment to CaM. Because many fragments showed positive binding to Ca2+-CaM in the initial screening, we have focused on the regions that displayed the relatively strongest binding. These experiments led to the identification of five CaM-binding sites on TRPM4: two sites located in the N terminus (E5/V25 and M186/R212), and three clustered in the C terminus (A1076/S1098, R1095/T1151, and E1146/E1176). Among them, fragment v (R1095/T1151) is rather unique in that it is much longer than most commonly found CaM-binding domains, which are typically α-helices of about 20–30 amino acids. Shorter fragments were made from R1095/T1151, but they all failed to show a strong binding to Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 6B, right panels). Nevertheless, the N-terminal half, R1095/E1130 (fragment w), retained partial binding to CaM and was considered weakly positive. With the exception of the A1076/S1098 fragment, binding of CaM only occurred in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 6C). A1076/S1098 also binds CaM in the absence of Ca2+, but binding is strongly enhanced by addition of Ca2+. Next, we tested whether deletion of the CaM-binding sites affects TRPM4 activity. For both N-terminal deletion mutants (ΔE5/V25 and ΔM186/R211), whole-cell currents upon dialysis of 10 μm Ca2+ showed a similar activation time course as wild-type TRPM4. The shape of the I-V curves was also similar to that of the wild-type channels, and current densities were not significantly different (wild type, 165 ± 47 pA/picofarad, n = 6; ΔE5/V25, 120 ± 29 pA/picofarad, n = 6; ΔM186/R211, 99 ± 39 pA/picofarad, n = 5). In inside-out patches, the kinetics and Ca2+ sensitivity of the ΔE5/V25 and ΔM186/R211 mutants were also similar (data not shown). In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal CaM-binding sites strongly affected TRPM4 channel function (Fig. 7). Truncation of the C terminus after Ala1068 (A1068X), which eliminates all three sites, reduced the amplitude of Ca2+-activated currents to that of non-transfected cells. Truncation of the C terminus after Glu1146 (E1146X), which only eliminated the last CaM-binding site, reduced current amplitudes by ∼90% compared with wild-type TRPM4, without altering the biophysical properties of the channel (Fig. 7, A and B). Disruption of individual sites (ΔA1076/S1098, ΔR1095/E1130, or ΔV1127/T1151) resulted in very small currents (Fig. 7C). The ΔE1146/E1176 deletion mutant had similar currents as the E1146X truncation (data not shown). The double mutant ΔA1076/S1098-R1095/E1130 was completely silent. The most straightforward explanation of these results is that CaM is involved in Ca2+ sensing of TRPM4. However, because the mutant channels were still activated by Ca2+, albeit to a lesser extent, it cannot be excluded that Ca2+ activates TRPM4 directly and that CaM only plays a modulatory role. To test this possibility, we stimulated excised cell-free patches from all CaM mutants with Ca2+. Although the whole-cell currents were not resolvable from the background, we were still able to activate these TRPM4 deletion mutants in excised patches, albeit only at extremely positive potentials and very high Ca2+ concentrations. Fig. 7, D and E, shows an example for the deletion mutant ΔE1146/E1176. Currents were activated in inside-out patches by 1000 μm Ca2+. In control patches, a very large current can be measured at +100 mV. For all deletion mutants of the three identified Ca2+-CaM binding sites, however, the current at +100 mV was very small, and larger currents could only be activated at more positive potentials. This pattern was measured in all three CaM-deletion mutants (n = 6 for ΔA1076/S1098, ΔR1095/E1130, and ΔE1146/E1167) but absent in non-transfected cells (n = 7). Also, among all C-terminal mutants, the largest currents were measured with the most distal ΔE1146/E1176 mutant in the inside-out patches, consistent with the whole-cell data. However, these currents show a similar pattern as described for the deletion of putative ATP binding site, namely, an accelerated and complete decay (data not shown; five patches). All these findings indicate that Ca2+ can still activate TRPM4, but its sensitivity is dramatically reduced by mutating the CaM-binding site or by structural changes in the C-terminal part of the channel that confers CaM binding. In order to confirm that the mutant TRPM4 proteins were expressed on the plasma membrane, we performed a cell surface biotinylation assay using GFP-tagged TRPM4 constructs. As shown in Fig. 7F, simi"
https://openalex.org/W2039223695,"Both estrogens and bisphosphonates attenuate osteocyte apoptosis by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). However, whereas estrogens activate ERKs via an extranuclear function of the estrogen receptor, bisphosphonates do so by opening connexin 43 hemichannels. Here, we demonstrated that the signaling events downstream of ERKs induced by these two stimuli are also distinct. Inhibition of osteocyte apoptosis by estrogens requires nuclear accumulation of ERKs and activation of downstream transcription factors. On the other hand, anti-apoptosis induced by bisphosphonates requires neither transcription nor ERK-dependent transcription factors. Instead, the effect of bisphosphonates is abolished when ERKs are restricted to the nucleus by blocking CRM1/exportin1-mediated nuclear protein export or by expressing nuclear-anchored ERKs, but it is unaffected in cells expressing cytoplasmic-anchored ERKs. Connexin 43/ERK-mediated anti-apoptosis induced by bisphosphonates requires the kinase activity of the cytoplasmic target of ERKs, p90RSK, which in turn phosphorylates the pro-apoptotic protein BAD and C/EBPβ. Phosphorylation of BAD renders it inactive, whereas phosphorylation of C/EBPβ leads to binding of pro-caspases, thus inhibiting apoptosis independently of the transcriptional activity of this transcription factor. Consistent with the evidence that estrogens and bisphosphonates phosphorylate diverse targets of ERKs, probably resulting from activation of spatially distinct pools of these kinases, the two agents had additive effects on osteocyte survival.

Remarkably, Cx43 (but not other connexins) confers de novo responsiveness to these agents to connexin-naïve cells. The ability of Cx43 to transduce pro-survival signals requires both the pore-forming domain of Cx43 and the C-terminal portion of the protein, which is physically associated with the kinase Src (3Kanemitsu M.Y.

Carcinog. 1999; 25: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Src activation and its interaction with Cx43 are indispensable for the anti-apoptotic effects of bisphosphonates (2Plotkin L.I.

Similar to bisphosphonates, ligand-induced activation of sex steroid receptors also attenuates osteocyte and osteoblast apoptosis by a mechanism that requires activation of ERKs and Src. However, the molecular events that lead to activation of the Src/ERK pathway by estrogens or androgens are different from the ones involved in bisphosphonate action. Thus, either class of sex steroids activate ERKs via an extranuclear function of their receptors that can be mediated by the ligand binding domain of the proteins (5Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L. Han K. DiGregorio G.B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C.

In addition, kinase-dependent activation of transcription factors and gene transcription is required for the anti-apoptotic effect of sex steroids on osteoblastic cells (6Kousteni S. Han L. Chen J.R. Almeida M. Plotkin L.I. Bellido T. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1651-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heretofore, the mechanism by which bisphosphonates prevent apoptosis downstream of ERKs, however, has remained unknown. We report that, unlike the anti-apoptotic effect of ERK activation induced by sex steroids, anti-apoptotic effects triggered by the Cx43/Src/ERK pathway do not require gene transcription or ERK-dependent transcription factors. Instead, they depend on the cytoplasmic localization of ERKs and the phosphorylation of the ERK-activated kinase p90RSK and its cytoplasmic targets BAD and C/EBPβ. Moreover, and consistent with the evidence that estrogens and bisphosphonates phosphorylate diverse targets of ERKs, the two agents had additive effects on osteocyte survival, supporting the notion that they activate spatially distinct pools of these kinases.

The percentage of apoptosis was calculated using the formula (% DCe+s - % DCs)/(% DCe - % DCv) × 100, where DC = dead cells, e = etoposide-treated cultures, s = alendronate- or 17β-estradiol-treated cultures, and v = vehicle-treated cultures, as published previously (2Plotkin L.I.

Inhibition of RNA or Protein Synthesis—MLO-Y4 cells were incubated with 1 μCi/ml [3H]uridine or [3H]leucine for 2.5 h followed by the addition of 2 × 10-6m actinomycin D or 10-6m cycloheximide and incubation for 7.5 h. The cells were scraped off the plates, protein and RNA were precipitated with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the radioactivity was quantified. Protein concentration in the precipitates was determined using a detergent-compatible Bio-Rad kit. [3H]Uridine or [3H]leucine incorporation was expressed as counts/min/μg protein. Reporter Assay—Cells were transiently transfected with a construct containing amino acids 307–428 of the C-terminal domain of Elk-1 and the DNA binding domain of GAL4 fused to the firefly luciferase reporter (GAL4-Luc) together with the Renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-SV40. Forty hours after transfection, the cells were treated with vehicle or 1 ng/ml leptomycin B alone or together with 10-7m alendronate or 10-7m 17β-estradiol for 24 h in α-MEM containing 0.2% serum. Cell lysates were obtained and luciferase activity was measured using a dual luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Elk-1 promoter activity was normalized to Renilla activity, as published previously (6Kousteni S. Han L. Chen J.R. Almeida M. Plotkin L.I. Bellido T. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1651-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Cells maintained in the absence of serum were treated with vehicle, 10-7m alendronate or 10-7m 17β-estradiol for the indicated times. Proteins in the cell lysates were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-phospho-Thr217-C/EBPβ, anti-total C/EBPβ, anti-HA-tagged antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-phospho-Ser112-BAD antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), or mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Blots were developed by chemiluminescence (Pierce), and the intensity of the bands was quantified using the Versadoc Imaging system (Bio-Rad). In-gel Kinase Assay—p90RSK in-gel kinase activity was determined using an assay described previously (22Bellido T. Borba V.Z.C. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3666-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), with modifications. Briefly, MLO-Y4 cells cultured in 2% bovine serum albumin α-MEM for 4 h were treated with 10-7m alendronate or 10-7 17β-estradiol for the last 5 or 30 min of the incubation, respectively. Fifty μg of protein were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.05 mg/ml of the p90RSK synthetic substrate peptide (Arg-Arg-Arg-Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Arg-Ala) corresponding to amino acids 231–239 of human 40 S ribosomal protein S6 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) (23Joseph D.E. Paul C.C. Baumann M.A. Gomez-Cambronero J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13088-13093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The gel was then incubated with 40 mm HEPES, pH 8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Mg2Cl, 40 μm ATP, and 25 μCi [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at 25 °C and then washed and dried. Radioactivity was detected using the Versadoc Imaging system (Bio-Rad). A parallel 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel was run, and the levels of β-actin were determined by Western blotting. The levels of phosphorylated p90RSK substrate were normalized to the levels of β-actin in the same sample. Image Acquisition—Fluorescent images were collected on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200, Carl Zeiss Light Microscopy, Gottingen, Germany) with a LD A-Plan, 32×/0.40 lens and a low light camera (Polaroid DMC Ie, Polaroid Corporation, Cambridge, MA) using a filter set for GFP and the Image-Pro Plus acquisition software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). ERK Phosphorylation—ERK activation was determined using a fast activated cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (FACE, Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, cells cultured in α-MEM containing 2% serum for 24 h were incubated in α-MEM containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 4 h and then treated with alendronate, 17β-estradiol, or both at 10-9 or 10-7m for the last 2 min. The cells were then fixed and incubated with specific anti-phosphorylated or anti-total ERK antibodies followed by incubation with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. The levels of phosphorylated or total ERKs were quantified using a colorimetric readout and are expressed as the ratio between phosphorylated and total ERKs. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and the Student-Neuman-Keuls method was used to estimate the level of significance of differences between means. Inhibition of Apoptosis by Alendronate Does Not Require Nuclear Functions of ERKs—ERKs promote anti-apoptosis by inducing changes in gene transcription or by modifying the functional activity of proteins, independent of any transcriptional effects (6Kousteni S.

We, therefore, examined here whether transcription, at large, or ERK-dependent transcription factors, in particular, were a requirement for the anti-apoptotic effect of the bisphosphonate alendronate on MLO-Y4 osteocytic cells. We found that inhibition of RNA or protein synthesis with actinomycin D or cycloheximide, respectively, did not influence the protective effect of alendronate on etoposide-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1a). Likewise, dominant negative forms of Elk-1, CREB, Runx2/Cbfa1, C/EBPβ/NF-IL6, or STAT3, transcription factors activated by ERKs (26Cruzalegui F.H. Cano E. Treisman R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7948-7957Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 28Vanhoutte P. Barnier J.V.

J. 2002; 364: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), did not alter alendronate-induced anti-apoptosis (Fig. 1b). In contrast and consistent with earlier studies (6Kousteni S. Han L. Chen J.R. Almeida M. Plotkin L.I. Bellido T. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1651-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the anti-apoptotic effect of 17β-estradiol in the same cells required gene transcription and was abolished by dominant negative forms of Elk-1, CREB, and C/EBPβ (Fig. 1, a and b). Unexpectedly for an agent that induces ERK phosphorylation, exposure of MLO-Y4 cells to alendronate for up to 4 h did not result in the accumulation of ERKs into the nucleus, as it was assessed using a GFP-ERK2 fusion protein (Fig. 1, c and d). Once again, this biologic profile was different to that of 17β-estradiol, which caused nuclear accumulation of GFP-ERK2. Indeed, this effect of 17β-estradiol was manifested as early as 2 min, reached a plateau after 30 min, and returned to base line by 4 h. Consistent with the distinct pattern of ERK translocation into the nucleus in response to the two agents, alendronate failed to induce a significant increase in Elk-1-mediated transcription (Fig. 1f). On the other hand, 17β-estradiol did have a potent effect on Elk-1-driven transcription. To determine whether the inability of alendronate to induce nuclear ERK accumulation or ERK-dependent transcription results from either lack of nuclear translocation of the active kinases or from an accelerated nuclear export of ERKs, we investigated the effect of leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of the nuclear protein exporter CRM1/exportin1 (31Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 886: 23-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in this phenomenon. Leptomycin B did not affect GFP-ERK2 nuclear accumulation or Elk-1 reporter activity in response to alendronate (as well as 17β-estradiol), suggesting that the failure of alendronate to induce ERK nuclear accumulation does not result from increased nuclear export of ERKs (Fig. 1, e and f). That nuclear accumulation of ERKs was not a requirement for the anti-apoptotic effect of bisphosphonates was subsequently documented by restricting proteins, in general, into the nuclear compartment, using leptomycin B, or by specific restriction of ERKs into the nuclear compartment, using a GFP-ERK2 mutant with impaired association to MEK (nuclear GFP-ERK2) (17Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Either experimental manipulation completely abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of alendronate (Fig. 2). The Anti-apoptotic Effect of Alendronate Requires p90RSK and Its Target, BAD—Activated p90RSK is a downstream effector of nuclear or cytoplasmic events initiated by ERK phosphorylation (32Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 33Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, p90RSK is not a universal requirement for the pro-survival effects of ERKs (24Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 34Garcia J. Ye Y. Arranz V. Letourneux C. Pezeron G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5151-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To establish whether p90RSK is involved in the anti-apoptotic effect of alendronate, we searched for and found that alendronate and also 17β-estradiol increased p90RSK kinase activity (Fig. 3a). Consistent with this finding, cells expressing a catalytically inactive dominant negative p90RSK (kinase-dead) failed to respond to alendronate. As shown earlier in osteoblastic cells (6Kousteni S. Han L. Chen J.R. Almeida M. Plotkin L.I. Bellido T. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1651-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the anti-apoptotic effect of 17β-estradiol in MLO-Y4 osteocytic cells also required p90RSK catalytic activity. The pro-apoptotic protein BAD is one of several cytoplasmic substrates of the ERK/p90RSK pathway. Specifically, phosphorylation of BAD by p90RSK in Ser112 renders BAD inactive and thereby promotes cell survival (24Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3b, alendronate induced BAD phosphorylation in Ser112. Moreover, cells expressing dominant negative BAD mutants in which Ser112 is substituted by Ala (S112A/S136A/S155A or S112A) were refractory to the anti-apoptotic effect of alendronate (Fig. 3b). On the other hand, cells expressing BAD mutants, in which serines not involved in p90RSK phosphorylation were mutated (S136A or S155A), were protected from etoposide-induced apoptosis by alendronate as effectively as cells expressing the wild type BAD. Remarkably, even though 17β-estradiol also induced BAD phosphorylation in Ser112, phosphorylation at this site was not essential for anti-apoptosis in response to the hormone, as cells expressing S112A BAD were still protected from etoposide-induced apoptosis by 17β-estradiol. In contrast, 17β-estradiol was unable to protect from apoptosis cells expressing S136A or S115A mutants, indicating that phosphorylation of BAD in Ser136 and Ser155 was required for its effect (Fig. 3b). Hence, both alendronate and 17β-estradiol inactivate BAD by phosphorylating this pro-apoptotic protein. Although phosphorylation of Ser112 (but not Ser136 and Ser155) is critical for the effect of alendronate, phosphorylation of Ser136 and Ser155 (but not Ser112) are indispensable for the effect of 17β-estradiol. An Extranuclear, Transcription-independent Function of C/EBPβ Is Required for the Anti-apoptotic Effect of the Cx43/Src/ERK/p90RSK Pathway—It has been demonstrated that p90RSK-mediated phosphorylation of C/EBPβ in Thr217 promotes its binding to pro-caspases 1 and 8, thereby leading to cell survival. Caspase inactivation represents a C/EBPβ action not predicted by its well known function as transcription factor, as it is indeed independent of transcription (14Buck M. Poli V. Hunter T. Chojkier M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 807-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Both alendronate and 17β-estradiol increased phosphorylation of C/EBPβ in Thr217 (Fig. 4a). However, this phosphorylation event was only required for the anti-apoptotic effect of alendronate but not for that of 17β-estradiol. Thus, cells expressing a C/EBPβ mutant in which Thr217 is replaced by Ala (rendering a caspase binding-deficient protein) were not protected from etoposide-induced apoptosis by alendronate. 17β-Estradiol, however, was as effective in these cells as in cells expressing wild type C/EBPβ. Conversely, cells expressing a C/EBPβ mutant lacking transcriptional activity due to its inability to bind DNA (8Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were protected from apoptosis by alendronate (Figs. 1b and 4a). On the other hand, 17β-estradiol failed to induce survival in cells expressing this mutant (Fig. 4a). We next examined the ability of alendronate to phosphorylate C/EBPβ in cells in which hemichannels or the ERK/p90RSK pathway had been disrupted. Similar to the findings with untransfected MLO-Y4 cells shown in Fig. 4a, alendronate induced C/EBPβ phosphorylation in Thr217 in MLO-Y4 cells transfected with empty vector. However, alendronate was ineffective in cells transfected with a dominant negative form of Cx43 with impaired permeability (Cx43Δ130) (19Krutovskikh V.A. Yamasaki H. Tsuda H. Asamoto M. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 23: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or in cells transfected with a Cx43 mutant that lacks the C-terminal domain and therefore lacks the ability to bind Src and activate the ERK pathway (Cx43Δ245) (18Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4b). Transfection with these mutants also abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of alendronate (Fig. 4c). Moreover, alendronate did not increase C/EBPβ phosphorylation in cells transfected with dominant negative forms of MEK or p90RSK that lack kinase activity (Fig. 4b). Further, alendronate induced C/EBPβ phosphorylation in embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild type mice, but it failed to do so in embryonic fibroblasts derived from Cx43-deficient mice (Fig. 4d). Altogether, these results confirm that C/EBPβ phosphorylation in Thr217 results from alendronate-induced opening of Cx43 hemichannels and the subsequent activation of the Src/ERK/p90RSK pathway leading to cell survival.

https://openalex.org/W2152842423,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which cartilage formation is regulated is essential toward understanding the physiology of both embryonic bone development and postnatal bone growth. Although much is known about growth factor signaling in cartilage formation, the regulatory role of noncollagenous matrix proteins in this process are still largely unknown. In the present studies, we present evidence for a critical role of DMP1 (dentin matrix protein 1) in postnatal chondrogenesis. The Dmp1 gene was originally identified from a rat incisor cDNA library and has been shown to play an important role in late stage dentinogenesis. Whereas no apparent abnormalities were observed in prenatal bone development, Dmp1-deficient (Dmp1-/-) mice unexpectedly develop a severe defect in cartilage formation during postnatal chondrogenesis. Vertebrae and long bones in Dmp1-deficient (Dmp1-/-) mice are shorter and wider with delayed and malformed secondary ossification centers and an irregular and highly expanded growth plate, results of both a highly expanded proliferation and a highly expanded hypertrophic zone creating a phenotype resembling dwarfism with chondrodysplasia. This phenotype appears to be due to increased cell proliferation in the proliferating zone and reduced apoptosis in the hypertrophic zone. In addition, blood vessel invasion is impaired in the epiphyses of Dmp1-/- mice. These findings show that DMP1 is essential for normal postnatal chondrogenesis and subsequent osteogenesis.

Most of the vertebrate appendicular and axial skeleton is formed through endochondral ossification, which occurs in the epiphysis and growth plate. During development, mesenchymal stem cells first differentiate into cartilage, which acts as a template and determines the shape of future bone. After formation, cartilage is removed and replaced by bone. Considerable progress has been made in the last decade in identifying the mechanisms responsible for prenatal longitudinal bone growth, which is initiated and controlled by factors such as parathyroid hormone-related peptide, Indian hedgehog, and fibroblast growth factor (1Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar, 2de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Nakashima K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Parathyroid hormone-related peptide maintains chondrocyte proliferation, whereas Indian hedgehog controls and accelerates chondrocyte differentiation. This is balanced by fibroblast growth factor signaling, which retards chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. In addition, Runx2/Cbfa1 signaling plays a critical role in this process by stimulating hypertrophic chondrocyte maturation (3Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). However, mechanisms for regulating postnatal growth and development of cartilage are not as well characterized. This is important because there are numerous skeletal diseases that first manifest in childhood and worsen with age such as chondrodysplasias (7Rimoin D.L. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 63: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).DMP1 belongs to a glycosylated and phosphorylated group of proteins, called SIBLINGs for small, integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycoproteins. These molecules share similar genomic and biochemical features. The members of this family also include bone sialoprotein, osteopontin (OPN), 1The abbreviations used are: OPN, osteopontin; WT, wild type; KO, knock-out; PECAM-1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.1The abbreviations used are: OPN, osteopontin; WT, wild type; KO, knock-out; PECAM-1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), and matrix extracellular phosphogly-coprotein. All of these family members bind hydroxyapatite (8Fisher L.W. Torchia D.A. Fohr B. Young M.F. Fedarko N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Bone sialoprotein, OPN, and DMP1 also bridge complement Factor H to cell surface receptors, an alternative complement pathway to prevent cell lysis (8Fisher L.W. Torchia D.A. Fohr B. Young M.F.

Furthermore, the SIBLING proteins can interact with integrin and CD44 receptors, and their integrin interactions are usually mediated through the RGD motif (10Weber G.F. Ashkar S. Glimcher M.J. Cantor H. Science. 1996; 271: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). CD44 is a membrane bound protein thought to interact with the ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) family of adapter proteins that link to actin in the cytoskeleton. Although many in vitro studies have indicated that the various family members have specific biological activities, none of the knock-out animals in which these molecules have been ablated have shown an apparent bone phenotype.With regards to the function of DMP1, it has been reported that overexpression of Dmp1 in vitro induces differentiation and mineralization of mesenchymal stem cells (11Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, the effects of recombinant DMP1 on in vitro mineralization are controversial and depend on phosphorylation state (12Tartaix P.H. Doulaverakis M. George A. Fisher L.W. Butler W.T. Qin C.

In vivo, Dmp1 is mainly expressed in mineralizing tissues in cells such as hypertrophic chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteocytes (13D'Souza R.N. Cavender A. Sunavala G. Alvarez J. Ohshima T.

First observations showed that Dmp1-/- embryos and newborns displayed no apparent skeletal nor tooth phenotype, suggesting that DMP1 may be redundant or nonessential for early dentinogenesis and osteogenesis (17Feng J.Q. Huang H. Lu Y. Ye L. Xie Y. Tsutsui T.W. Kunieda T. Castranio T. Scott G. Bonewald L.B. Mishina Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, postnatally, Dmp1-/- mice develop a profound tooth formation defect characterized by a partial failure of maturation of predentin into dentin, enlarged pulp chambers, increased width of the predentin zone with reduced dentin wall thickness and hypomineralization (18Ye L.

Sabsay B. Simonian P.A. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in postnatal cartilage formation. Here we report changes in chondrocyte morphology, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in postnatal Dmp1-/- mice. We found that Dmp1 is essential for postnatal cartilage formation, especially for the cell fate of hypertrophic chondrocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—The Dmp1-/- mice were generated with exon 6 deletion as described previously (17Feng J.Q. Huang H. Lu Y. Ye L. Xie Y. Tsutsui T.W. Kunieda T. Castranio T. Scott G. Bonewald L.B. Mishina Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The control, wild type (WT), heterozygous (Dmp1+/-), and homozygous (Dmp1-/-) null mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 or CD-1 background. The animal protocol for their use was approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees in University of Missouri-Kansas City and NIEHS, National Institutes of Health.X-ray Radiography and Micro-computed Tomography—WT, Dmp1+/-, and Dmp1-/- mice (from newborn to 12 months of age) were examined radiographically using a specimen radiography system (model MX-20; Faxitron, Buffalo Grove, Illinois). The tibiae from 1- and 12-month-old control and null or knock-out (KO) mice were scanned using a compact fan beam-type tomograph (Micro-CT 40; Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland) (21Ruegsegger P. Koller B. Muller R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1996; 58: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar).Backscattered Scanning Electron Microscopy—Femurs from WT and Dmp1-/- mice were dissected and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer solution (pH 7.4) at room temperature for 4 h and then transferred to 0.1 m cacodylate buffer solution. After dehydration in ascending concentrations of ethanol, the bones were fractured under a dissecting microscope and mounted on aluminum stubs with the fractured surface upward facing, sputter-coated with gold and palladium, and examined with field emission scanning electron microscopy (Philips XL30, FEI Company, Oregon).Preparation of Decalcified Paraffin, Methylmethacrylate, and Frozen Sections—To analyze morphological changes, skeletal tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h (22Zhao M. Harris S.E. Horn D. Geng Z. Nishimura R. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). One hind limb was decalcified and embedded in paraffin, and the other hind limb was embedded in methylmethacrylate (22Zhao M. Harris S.E. Horn D. Geng Z. Nishimura R. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Frozen sections were prepared on 10- and 19-day-old animals. Histological analyses were performed on both femoral and tibial bone from 10-day-old to 5-month-old WT and Dmp1-/- mice.Histological Staining and Preparation—Nondecalcified sections were used for Goldner's Masson Trichrome staining (22Zhao M. Harris S.E. Horn D. Geng Z. Nishimura R. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Safranin-O staining was used for visualizing proteoglycans (23Kiernan J. Histological and Histochemical Methods: Theory and Practice. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Boston1999Google Scholar). Slides containing femoral growth plates were stained with 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine to detect proliferating cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma).Histomorphometry—The length of each of the chondrocyte zones, the resting, proliferation, and hypertrophic zones, in femoral growth plates were measured using the software of OsteoMeasure System (version 4.1, Atlanta, GA) from a minimum of 20 measurements/section. Lines were drawn between each zone, and the average distance was determined. A minimum of three animals/group were used.To determine the epiphyseal and metaphyseal areas, tibia from 3-week-old animals (n = 5) were first radiographed. Then the OsteoMeasure system was used to measure the total area above the growth plate for epiphyses, and the area below the growth plate was used for metaphyses. The Student's t test was used to determine significant differences between groups, the Dmp1-/- and the control group.Immunohistochemistry—The Cleaved Caspase 3 (Asp175) antibody from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA) was used for detection of apoptotic cells, and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, CA) was used for detecting endothelial cells in blood vessels. The monoclonal antibody against collagen type II was purchased from Lab Vision Corporation (Fremont, CA), and the polyclonal antibody against collagen type X was a gift from Dr. Gregory Lunstrum (Portland Research Center, Oregon). Anti-OPN antibody was obtained from Dr. Larry Fisher (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health), and anti-matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) polyclonal antibody was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). After deparaffinization and rehydration, the sections were immersed in 3% H2O2 to quench endogenous peroxidase and further digested with 1 mg/ml trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C. Sections were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin containing 1% serum at room temperature for 2 h. The primary antibodies were added to the sections and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the sections were coated with biotinylated second antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at a dilution of 1:200 and then incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The sections were washed again and incubated with the ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) at room temperature for 60 min. The 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate was used to visualize immunoreaction sites. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted on glass slides. Negative controls were obtained by substituting the primary antibody with normal serum or normal IGG.In Situ Hybridization for VEGF—The mouse VEGF mRNA was used for in situ hybridization as described previously (16Feng J.Q. Zhang J. Dallas S.L. Lu Y. Chen S. Tan X. Owen M. Harris S.E. MacDougall M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1822-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, the digoxigenin-labeled VEGF cRNA was prepared by using an RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). The hybridization temperature was set at 55 °C, and the washing temperature was set at 70 °C so that endogenous alkaline phosphatase is inactivated. Digoxigenin-labeled nucleic acids were detected in an enzyme-linked immunoassay with a specific anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase antibody conjugate, and the color substrates nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate were used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science).MMP9 Expression and Activity—To determine whether the activity of MMP9/gelatinase B is altered in the null mice, the femoral-tibial joint was dissected free from skin and muscle followed by homogenization in 0.01 m Tris-Cl (pH 7.2) solution. Normalized sample aliquots (10 μg) were mixed with 3 μlof5× zymogram loading buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml of gelatin. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 renaturing buffer and incubated overnight at 37 °C in developing buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% Brij 35) followed by staining with Coomassie Blue.RESULTSDmp1-/-Mice Exhibit a Chondrodysplasia-like Phenotype—To determine the role of Dmp1 in skeletal development and growth, we generated Dmp1-/- null (KO) mice (17Feng J.Q. Huang H. Lu Y. Ye L. Xie Y. Tsutsui T.W. Kunieda T. Castranio T. Scott G. Bonewald L.B. Mishina Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The bones of Dmp1+/- heterozygote mice were similar to the WT littermates with comparable weight, growth rates, and radiographic and histological appearance, suggesting that the loss of a single copy of the Dmp1 gene has no apparent effect on skeletal development (data not shown). At birth, the Dmp1-/- mice show no visible gross skeletal abnormalities by radiographic analysis (data not shown). However, the Dmp1-/- null mice develop an age-dependent defect in skeletal formation similar to human conditions of chondrodysplasia (Fig. 1). This phenotype is evident at 10 days after birth and progresses with age. The major abnormalities observed in Dmp1-/- mice are decreased endochondral ossification, failure to lengthen, increases in width, and flaring at the metaphyses or ends of the long bones (Fig. 1). These abnormalities appear to be 100% penetrant and progressively worsen with age (Fig. 1e). Radiographic analysis revealed that the midshafts of the Dmp1-/- long bones are wider and fail to form a normal diaphysis compared with the control littermates (Fig. 1, a–e). A delay in appearance of the secondary ossification center of the epiphysis occurs concurrently with an expansion of the metaphysis in the long bone as shown at days 10, 14, and 21 (Fig. 1, b–d; quantitated in Fig. 1g), as well as in vertebrae at days 15 and 30 that are also shorter and wider than controls (Fig. 1f). Photographs of tibia/fibula emphasize the dysplastic phenotype (Fig. 2a). Quantitative measurement of these long bones showed a significant decrease in length and a significant increase in width of tibia from the Dmp1-/- null mice (Fig. 2b). Micro-CT analysis further confirmed the delayed and malformed epiphyses in Dmp1-/- mice (Fig. 2, c and d). Also noted by micro-CT was increased porosity and an expanded growth plate.Fig. 2Analyses of deformed tibias in Dmp1-/- mice. Photographs (a) and quantitative (b) analyses of tibias from 3-week-old and 3- and 5-month-old animals. A significant difference is observed between the WT and the mutant (KO) tibiae in both length and width. Representative three-dimensional micro-CT reconstruction of 1-month-old tibiae with whole mount view (c) and sagittal section view (d) are shown. The secondary ossification center is delayed and malformed (arrows), and the growth plate is dramatically expanded (arrowheads) in the tibia from Dmp1-/- mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Severe Abnormalities in Growth Plates in Dmp1-/-Mice— Images using backscattered scanning electron microscopy that allow visualization of mineralized tissues (bright area) show clear separation of the epiphysis and metaphyseal by the sharply demarcating growth plate in WT mice (Fig. 3a, upper panel). In contrast, the growth plate from Dmp1-/- mice appears as an irregular and discontinuous band poorly separating the epiphysis and metaphysis, and the bone appears hypomineralized (Fig. 3a, lower panel). Histological examination using safranin-O staining revealed that the well ordered vertical columns of chondrocytes observed in the WT growth plate were replaced by a disorganized and irregular growth plate with a dramatically expanded hypertrophic zone in Dmp1-/- mice (Fig. 3, c and d). Quantitation of the lengths of the proliferation zone and the hypertrophic zone showed a significant increase in both in the Dmp1-/- mice compared with wild type at the age of 3 weeks (Fig. 4d).Fig. 3Malformed growth plates in the Dmp1-/- mice. Images from backscattered scanning electron microscopy of 6-week-old and 6- and 12-month-old mice. Well formed growth plate (arrows), epiphyses and metaphyses can be easily seen in the WT mice (a, upper panel). The growth plate of Dmp1-/- mice however, is expanded and disorganized with malformed epiphyses and metaphyses (a, lower panel, arrows). Representative sections from decalcified femurs, stained with Safranin-O show a striking expansion of the growth plate at the age of 3 weeks and irregularities at 3 months and complete disruption at 5 months in the Dmp1-/- null mice (b, lower panel) compared with the WT growth plates (b, upper panel). Visually, histology shows an increased proliferation and hypertropic zone (c). Quantitative histomorphometry shows a significant increase in the proliferation zone of almost a doubling and in the hypertrophic zone of a 3-fold increase in femurs of 3-month-old Dmp1-/- mice compared with wild type controls (d). PZ, proliferation zone; HZ, hypertrophic zone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Increased proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and reduced calcification of the cartilaginous matrix and trabecular bone in the Dmp1-/- mice. A significant increase in cell proliferation as detected using bromodeoxyuridine labeling was observed in tibial growth plate of 2-month-old Dmp1-/- mice (a, arrows). No apparent difference in intensity of type II (b, arrowheads) and type X (c) collagen expression was observed in femora of 3-week-old Dmp1-/- mice. Caspase 3 staining showed a significant decrease in apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes in 3-week-old Dmp1-/- mice (d). Goldner's Masson Trichrome staining of a tibial growth plate displays an expanded, disorganized growth plate, a poorly calcified cartilage matrix, and reduced trabecular bone formation in a 3-month-old Dmp1-/- mouse (e).

Bromodeoxyuridine labeling of the proliferating cells shows that chondrocyte proliferation in the proliferation zone was increased ∼4-fold in 2-month-old Dmp1-/- mice (Fig. 4a), suggesting that a greater number of chondrocytes enter the hypertrophic zone. We then examined changes in chondrocyte differentiation, using the marker genes, type IIα collagen (expressed in proliferating and mature chondrocytes) and type X collagen (expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes). We found no significant differences in staining intensity in type IIα and type X collagen expression in growth plates from either the WT or Dmp1-/- mice (Fig. 4, b and c). Next, we determined the extent of programmed cell death or apoptosis using the caspase 3 immunostain (Fig. 5d). Quantitative data show that the percentage of apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes was reduced over 70% in the null mice (Fig. 5d). Subsequently, changes in mineralization in Dmp1-/- mice compared with WT mice were determined using Goldner staining of nondecalcified sections of tibial growth plates from 3-month-old mice. The normal growth plate is composed of well ordered, vertical columns of chondrocytes with few hypertrophic chondrocytes, and the subchondral vascular resorption front is of uniform size with well mineralized trabecular bone (Fig. 4e, left panel). In contrast, the Dmp1-/- growth plate was thicker and disorganized and exhibited a dramatic increase in the proportion of hypertrophic chondrocytes. The matrix surrounding the hypertrophic chondrocytes was poorly calcified (Fig. 5e, right panel, arrows). There is also reduced trabecular bone formation. These observations suggest that the normal function of DMP1 is to control the function of the growth plate by reducing chondrocyte proliferation and enhancing the final differentiation step for the growth plate chondrocyte, apoptosis. These observations also suggest that DMP1 is essential for the transition of chondrogenesis to osteogenesis.Fig. 5Delayed blood vessel invasion in Dmp1-/- epiphyses. Polyclonal antibody against OPN (a), a marker of new bone formation is reduced in the KO epiphysis (arrow) but increased in the KO metaphysis (arrowhead) from a 3-week-old animal. Monoclonal antibody against PECAM-1 was used on sections of day 10 (b) and 17 (c) femurs. The positively stained endothelial cells (in blue purple, arrows) are significantly reduced in the Dmp1-/- epiphysis at day 10, although the stained endothelial cells in surrounding areas appear normal (arrowhead). By day 17, more endothelial cells stained positive for PECAM-1 in the Dmp1-/- epiphysis compared with the control with well formed bone marrow (c, arrow). In situ hybridization was performed to examine changes in mRNA expression of VEGF (d), and immunostaining was performed to examine protein expression of MMP9 (f), and enzyme activity of MMP9 (e) were measured by genetin zymography in 10-day-old Dmp1-/- mice and the age-matched control mice (right panels). Both VEGF and MMP9 are expressed at sites of neovascularization (arrows) with no apparent difference in VEGF and MMP9 expression in Dmp1-/- mice compared with control littermates.

Development. 2002; 129: 1893-1904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ossification is delayed in Dmp1-/- mice as indicated by notably decreased expression of OPN, a marker for ossification, in the epiphyseal area of the growth plate (Fig. 5a). To determine whether the delayed and malformed secondary ossification center observed in Dmp1-/- mice was linked to a change in blood vessel invasion, we examined the expression of PECAM-1, a marker for blood vessel endothelial cells (27Albelda S. Oliver P. Romer L. Buck C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), by immunostaining sections from 10- and 17-day-old femurs (Fig. 5b). In 10-day-old Dmp1-/- mice, endothelial cells staining positively for PECAM-1 were restricted to a very small region in the epiphysis compared with the control. By day 17, bone marrow is well formed in the normal epiphysis, whereas the bone marrow space in the KO epiphysis is still very limited (Fig. 5c). Another marker for angiogenesis is VEGF (28Gerber H.P. Vu T.H. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Werb Z. Ferrara N. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar, 29Vu T.H. Shipley J.M.

As shown in Fig. 5d, there was no apparent difference in VEGF expression between the Dmp1-/- mice and their wild type littermates.MMP9 is also a key regulator of angiogenesis (28Gerber H.P. Vu T."

Both exhibit other similarities including deficits in wound healing that are associated with higher rates of fibroblast apoptosis. In order to investigate a potential mechanism for enhanced fibroblast apoptosis in diabetes and aged individuals, experiments were carried out to determine whether the predominant advanced glycation end product in skin, N-ϵ-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML)-collagen, could induce fibroblast apoptosis. In vivo experiments established that CML-collagen but not unmodified collagen induced fibroblast apoptosis and that apoptosis was dependent upon caspase-3, -8, and -9 activity. In vitro experiments demonstrated that CML-collagen but not control collagen induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in fibroblast apoptosis. By use of blocking antibodies, apoptosis was shown to be mediated through receptor for AGE signaling. AGE-induced apoptosis was largely dependent on the effector caspase, caspase-3, which was activated through both cytoplasmic (caspase-8-dependent) and mitochondrial (caspase-9) pathways. CML-collagen had a global effect of enhancing mRNA levels of pro-apoptotic genes that included several classes of molecules including ligands, receptors, adaptor molecules, mitochondrial proteins, and others. However, the pattern of expression was not identical to the pattern of apoptotic genes induced by tumor necrosis factor α.

This structure isomerizes to a more reactive ketoamine (Amadori product), which then may undergo additional rearrangement, dehydration, condensation, and oxidation reactions. These structures can result in protein cross-links and in a variety of protein modifications that collectively are known as advanced glycation end products (3.Paul R. Bailey A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1297-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). N-ϵ-(Carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) structure is a prevalent AGE and is generated principally by oxidative cleavage of Amadori intermediates (3.Paul R. Bailey A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1297-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). AGEs form in tissues and accumulate during aging. AGE formation occurs throughout life, and AGEs are found at significantly higher levels in aged individuals (4.Sell D. Nelson J. Monnier V. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med.

AGE formation is enhanced by hyperglycemia and has been linked to many of the complications of diabetes. By functionally blocking AGE activity or by applying AGEs in vivo, it has been shown that AGEs contribute to several pathologic processes.

Originally it was thought that most of the effects of AGEs were the result of cross-linking of matrix and other proteins (3.Paul R. Bailey A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1297-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although cross-linking is physiologically important, glycation can alter proteins so that they acquire signaling properties, which they do not otherwise possess. Several AGE cell surface receptors/binding proteins have been identified. The most thoroughly studied is receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). RAGE is a multi-ligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface receptors that binds many ligands including those of the S100/calgranulin family (22.Hofmann M. Drury S. Fu C. Qu W. Taguchi A. Lu Y. Avila C. Kambham N. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Neurath M. Slattery T. Beach D. Mcclary J. Nagashima M. Morser J. Stern D. Schmidt A. Cell. 1999; 97: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). Other receptors/binding proteins include macrophage scavenger receptor types I and II, oligosaccharyl transferase-48 (AGE-R1), 80K-H phosphoprotein (AGE-R2), and galectin-3 (AGE-R3). These are expressed on a wide range of cells including smooth muscle cells, monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, podocytes, astrocytes, microglia, and fibroblasts. Most of the biologic activities associated with AGEs have been shown to be transduced by RAGE, whereas the scavenger receptors are thought to regulate removal of AGEs (23.Stern D. Yan S. Yan S. Schmidt A. Ageing Res. Rev. 2002; 1: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 24.Bucciarelli L. Wendt T. Rong L. Lalla E. Hofmann M. Goova M. Taguchi A. Yan S. Yan S. Stern D. Schmidt A.

It is well known that AGEs form in the skin as part of the aging process and as a result of diabetes (31.Dyer D. Dunn J. Thorpe S. Bailie K. Lyons T. McCance D. Baynes J. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 2463-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 32.Bucala R. Cerami A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1992; 23: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 33.Schnider S. Kohn R. J. Clin. Investig. 1981; 67: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Accumulation of AGEs in skin has been related to tissue stiffening and lack of elasticity during aging (5.Danoux J. Br. J. Dermatol. 2001; 145: 1-10Crossref Google Scholar, 31.Dyer D. Dunn J. Thorpe S. Bailie K. Lyons T. McCance D. Baynes J. J. Clin.

However, AGEs in connective tissue can have detrimental effects through cell signaling. For example, RAGE activation in dermal fibroblasts reduces collagen synthesis and matrix production (34.Owen W. Hou F. Stuart R. Kay J. Boyce B. Chertow G. Schmidt A. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 1365-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). AGEs also contribute to impaired diabetic wound healing, in part through interfering with formation of an extracellular matrix (35.Goova M.T. Li J. Kislinger T. Qu W. Lu Y. Bucciarelli L.G. Nowygrod S. Wolf B.M. Caliste X. Yan S.F. Stern D.M. Schmidt A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 513-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). One mechanism through which AGEs may affect pathologic processes is by enhanced apoptosis as supported by in vitro studies. AGEs are pro-apoptotic for cultured retinal pericytes, corneal endothelial cells, neuronal cells, and renal mesangial cells (36.Kasper M. Roehlecke C. Witt M. Fehrenbach H. Hofer A. Miyata T.

Investig. Ophthalmol. 2003; 44: 521-528Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which AGEs lead to apoptosis are not well understood. There are reports suggesting that AGEs may enhance apoptosis indirectly through increasing oxidative stress or via induced expression of pro-apoptotic cytokines (36.Kasper M. Roehlecke C. Witt M. Fehrenbach H. Hofer A. Miyata T. Weigert C. Funk R. Schleicher E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 38.Kaji Y. Amano S. Usui T. Osbika T.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Interestingly, enhanced apoptosis of these cells is also associated with diabetic complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and accelerated vasculopathy (38.Kaji Y. Amano S. Usui T.

Med. 2001; 193: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Enhanced apoptosis has been linked to many of the detrimental effects of aging, which is also associated with AGE accumulation (41.Higami Y. Shimokawa I. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 301: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Because fibroblasts play important roles in the maintenance and healing of dermal connective tissue, the accumulation of AGEs in skin may have a detrimental effect, in part, through promoting fibroblast apoptosis. To address this issue, we investigated the apoptotic effect of AGEs on fibroblasts and the mechanisms through which AGEs induce apoptosis in these cells. CML-collagen—CML-collagen was prepared by chemical modification of acid-soluble bovine skin collagen (Sigma), as described previously (21.Santana R. Xu L. Chase H. Amar S. Graves D. Trackman P. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1502-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 42.Kislinger T. Fu C. Huber B. Qu W. Taguchi A. Du Yan S. Hofmann M. Yan S. Pischesrieder M. Stern D. Schmidt A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31740-31749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 mg of collagen was dissolved in 25 ml of 1 mm HCl freshly made in sterile water and incubated at 37 °C with occasional mixing. Sterile PBS (25 ml) was added, followed by sodium cyanoborohydride (1.42 g) and glyoxylic acid (0.715 g). Control collagen was prepared at the same time, except that no glyoxylic acid was added. All samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. AGE collagen and control collagen were then exhaustively dialyzed against distilled water. In dose-response experiments where higher concentrations of CML-collagen were used, AGE and control collagen was dialyzed against PBS. Both CML-collagen and control collagen were soluble at the concentrations stored and tested. In total, 3–8% of lysine residues in CML-collagen were converted to CML, as determined by the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid assay (43.Habeeb A. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 14: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). The percentage of modification of collagen that we have generated is 10-fold less than the amount used in a recent report to assess CML binding and activation of NF-κB (42.Kislinger T. Fu C. Huber B. Qu W. Taguchi A. Du Yan S. Hofmann M. Yan S. Pischesrieder M. Stern D. Schmidt A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31740-31749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) and only a small amount higher than that reported for the skin of aged or diabetic individuals (31.Dyer D. Dunn J. Thorpe S. Bailie K. Lyons T. McCance D. Baynes J. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 2463-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). CML-collagen was highly reactive on Western blots with anti-CML monoclonal antibody 6D12 (Wako, Richmond, VA), whereas control collagen was not reactive. The amount of endotoxin contamination was measured by Pyrochrome Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Inc., Woods Hole, MA) and found to be low (0.094 ± 0.01 ng/mg lipopolysaccharide in control collagen and 0.087 ± 0.01 ng/mg lipopolysaccharide in CML-collagen). Animals—CD1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, (Waltham, MA). These are outbred mice that were selected because they do not exhibit strain-associated responses, as has been reported in some cases where a particular strain of mouse has been studied (45.Belyavskyi M. Levy G. Leibowitz J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 440: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 46.Shi Z. Wakil A. Rockey D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10663-10668Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). All procedures involving mice were approved by the Boston University Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were anesthetized with injection of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) in sterile PBS. CML-collagen or unmodified collagen was injected into the loose connective tissue adjacent to calvarial bone at a point on the midline of the skull located between the ears. Injection at this anatomic site can be reproducibly achieved. For each data point, there were six mice (n = 6). We undertook preliminary experiments to identify a dose for CML-collagen that gave a moderate number of apoptotic cells. On this basis, 100 μg of CML-collagen or an equal amount of unmodified collagen was injected. Mice were euthanized 24 h after injection. In addition to CML-collagen or unmodified collagen alone, some animals were treated by intraperitoneal injection of caspase-3, -8, or -9 inhibitor (1 mg/kg) 1 h before CML-collagen injection and locally (25 μg) at the time of CML-collagen injection. The caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk, the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-fmk, and the caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-fmk were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Control mice received CML-collagen or unmodified collagen containing 2% Me2SO (Sigma-Aldrich). Preparation of Histologic Sections—Animals were euthanized by decapitation, and their heads were fixed for 72 h in cold 4% paraformaldehyde and decalcified by incubation with cold Immunocal (Decal Corp., Congers, NY) for ∼12 days with solution changed daily. Paraffin-embedded sagittal sections were prepared at a thickness of 5–6 μm. TUNEL Assay and Quantitative Histologic Analysis—Apoptotic cells were detected by an in situ TUNEL assay by means of a TACS 2 TdT-Blue Label kit purchased from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD), following the manufacturer's instructions. Sections were counterstained with nuclear fast red. The number of fibroblastic apoptotic cells was determined in six specimens per group by counting the number of TUNEL-positive cells that had the characteristic microscopic appearance of fibroblasts. Counts and measurements were confirmed by reanalysis of all the specimens by an independent examiner. The intra- and inter-examiner variations were <10%. Student's t test was used to determine significant differences between the experimental and control groups at the p < 0.05 level. Caspase Activity—Caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities from in vitro and in vivo experiments were assayed with fluorometric kits purchased from R&D Systems. Briefly, after sacrifice at the indicated time points, murine scalps were immediately dissected from the calvaria and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were pulverized, and lysates were prepared using cell lysis buffer provided by R&D Systems. After centrifugation, total protein was quantitated using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Caspase-3 activity was detected by using the specific caspase-3 fluorogenic substrate, DEVD peptide conjugated to 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC). Caspase-8 activity was detected by using the specific caspase-8 fluorogenic substrate, IETD-AFC. Caspase-9 activity was detected by using the specific caspase-9 fluorogenic substrate, LEHD-AFC. Measurements were made on a fluorescent microplate reader using filters for excitation (400 nm) and detection of emitted light (505 nm). In some assays, recombinant caspase-3 enzyme (R&D Systems) was used as a positive control. Buffers without cell lysate and cell lysate without substrate were used as negative controls. The same caspase-3, -8, and-9 inhibitors were used in both in vivo and in vitro studies. In addition, the pan-caspase (general caspase) inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was purchased from R&D Systems for in vitro assays. For each group, there were six specimens (n = 6). Cell Culture—Primary human adult dermal fibroblasts were purchased from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD). Cells were propagated and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cambrex) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, gentamicin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Experiments with CML-collagen were performed in culture medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Assays were performed when the cultures reached 75–85% confluence. In most experiments, 200 μg/ml CML-collagen or unmodified control collage was used, which is equivalent to 2 μm. Apoptosis of fibroblasts was determined by an ELISA technique measuring histone-associated DNA fragments (Roche Applied Science), following the manufacturer's instructions. In these studies, 20,000 fibroblasts/cm2 were treated with CML-collagen (200 μg/ml) or unmodified collagen (200 μg/ml) for 24 h. Apoptosis was determined by ELISA, and the cell numbers were assessed in corresponding wells to normalize apoptosis measurements. For caspase activity measurements, the same technique was used as described above for in vivo studies. In some cases, cells were treated with caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-8 + caspase-9, or pancaspase inhibitors (50 μm) at the time of CML-collagen stimulation. The dose of each inhibitor was selected based on our previous results (47.Alikhani M. Alikhani Z. He H. Liu R. Popek I. Graves D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52901-52908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Control cells were incubated in assay medium supplemented with vehicle alone (2% Me2SO) in the culture media. Inhibition of RAGE—Antibodies to the extracellular domain of RAGE have been shown to inhibit binding of CML modified proteins to RAGE and have been used to assess the impact of RAGE activation of cellular events (42.Kislinger T. Fu C. Huber B. Qu W. Taguchi A. Du Yan S. Hofmann M. Yan S. Pischesrieder M. Stern D. Schmidt A. J. Biol.

Jerums G. Cooper M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). To study the role of RAGE, fibroblast cultures were incubated with CML-collagen or unmodified collagen (200 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of anti-RAGE polyclonal antibodies specific for the extracellular domain of RAGE (10 μg/μl) or non-immune serum (10 μg/μl) for 24 h (Biocompare, San Francisco, CA). As controls, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml RAGE antiserum or non-immune serum without AGE stimulation. The extent of apoptosis was determined by ELISA. Statistical difference between samples was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests. EMSA—Fibroblast cultures were incubated in assay medium for 1 h with 200 μg/ml CML-collagen or unmodified collagen in the presence or absence of a specific NF-κB inhibitor, SN50 (100 μg/ml) (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Nuclear proteins were extracted using protein extraction kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Concentrations of nuclear proteins were measured by using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Interaction between NF-κB in the protein extract and DNA probe was investigated using EMSA kit from Panomics (Redwood City, CA) following the manufacturer's instruction. Microarray—Fibroblast cell cultures were exposed to CML-collagen (200 μg/ml) or TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 6 h. TNF-α was purchased from R&D Systems. Control cells were exposed to either unmodified collagen (200 μg/ml) or vehicle alone (PBS). RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Human Apoptosis GEArray Q series kit that includes 96 key genes involved in apoptosis was purchased from SuperArray, Inc. (Bethesda, MD). Total RNA was used as the template for 32P-labeled cDNA probe synthesis following the manufacturer's instructions. After overnight hybridization with labeled probe, the GEArray membranes were exposed using a PhosphorImager. The resulting digital image was converted to a raw data file using Scanalyze software (www.microarray.org/software.html). GEArray Analyzer software (SuperArray, Inc.) was used for data analysis. The microarray was performed twice with similar results, and the mean values of the two experiments are presented for each gene. The microarray for TNF-α stimulation was performed simultaneously with the AGE stimulation array. RT-PCR—Five μg of total RNA was used to produce cDNA using a First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (SuperArray, Inc.). PCR was performed on the synthesized cDNA using the SingleGene PCR Kit purchased from SuperArray, Inc. following the manufacturer's protocol. Specific primers were used for each gene, and GAPDH was used as internal control. This kit has the advantage that GAPDH and the gene of interest are amplified in the same tube and for the same number of cycles. Based on a pilot study, 24 and 28 cycles were chosen to compare the gene expression. After electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, bands were visualized on a UV-box. The density of each band was measured and compared using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The optical density of each band was normalized by the value of the GAPDH in the same lane. Two separate RT-PCRs were performed with similar results. Student's t test was used to determine significant differences between the experimental and control groups. In Vivo Induction of Apoptosis by CML-collagen—To study the effect of AGEs on fibroblast apoptosis in vivo, 100 μg of CML-collagen or control collagen was injected in the scalp of CD1 mice. Histologic sections were examined for fibroblast apoptosis by their characteristic appearance in the TUNEL assay (Fig. 1). Fibroblast apoptosis could be detected in the CML-collagen-treated group. In comparison, there was virtually no induction of fibroblast apoptosis in mice treated with unmodified collagen compared with the zero time point (Fig. 1A). Quantitative analysis indicated that CML-collagen stimulated a 4-fold increase in apoptotic cells compared with unmodified collagen (Fig. 1B) (p < 0.05). When expressed as the percentage of TUNEL-positive fibroblasts, the levels were 0.85 ± 0.05 in the CML-collagen-inoculated group and 0.21 ± 0.01 (p < 0.05) for control collagen-treated group. In Vitro Induction of Apoptosis by CML-collagen—In vitro studies were carried out to measure the direct effect of AGEs on fibroblast apoptosis under well-defined conditions. Apoptosis of human adult primary skin fibroblasts was measured by the relative amount of histone-associated DNA fragments in the cytoplasm as determined by ELISA. A time course experiment determined that AGE-induced apoptosis was not detected before 6 h (Fig. 2A). At the 6 h time point, a 1.7-fold increase was noted, whereas at 24 h, a 3-fold increase in apoptosis was detected. The increase at 6 and 24 h was statistically significant (p < 0.05). CML-collagen induced a dose-dependent increase in fibroblast apoptosis, whereas control collagen did not (Fig. 2B). At 200 μg/ml, CML-collagen compared with unmodified collagen induced a 3-fold increase in apoptosis, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Saturating levels were reached at 400 μg/ml CML-collagen with a 5-fold increase in apoptosis (p < 0.05). In subsequent studies,"

However, until now the mechanisms by which the integrin α9β1 modulates lymphangiogenesis have not been described. In this study we show that adhesion to and migration on the lymphangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF-C and -D) are α9β1-dependent. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human colon carcinoma cells (SW-480) transfected to express α9β1 adhered and/or migrated on both growth factors in a concentration-dependent fashion, and both adhesion and migration were abrogated by anti-α9β1 function-blocking antibody. In SW-480 cells, which lack cognate receptors for VEGF-C and -D, both growth factors induced α9β1-dependent Erk and paxillin phosphorylation. Human microvascular endothelial cells, which express both α9β1 and VEGF-R3, also adhered to and migrated on both growth factors, and both responses were blocked by anti-α9β1 antibody.

Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins, which serve as receptors for a variety of spatially fixed extracellular ligands (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar). By virtue of their dual roles in adhesion and signaling and because of their close association with the actin cytoskeleton, integrins play important roles in regulating cell shape and cell migration (2Friedl P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 3Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R.

In vertebrates there are 8 identified integrin β subunits and 18 α subunits that form at least 25 different heterodimers (4Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6687) Google Scholar). The integrin α9 subunit forms a single heterodimer with β1 and is expressed in epithelial cells, smooth and skeletal muscle, neutrophils, and a subset of endothelial cells (5Palmer E.L. Ruegg C.

In vitro, the principal demonstrated function of α9β1 is acceleration of cell migration, an effect that depends on unique sequences within the α9 cytoplasmic domain (7Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T.

In these mice lymph leaked into the pleural space (chylothorax), and the mice died 6–12 days after birth. This phenotype was an unexpected finding which indicated that lymph vessel development and/or function was abnormal (9Huang X.Z. Wu J.F. Ferrando R. Lee J.H. Wang Y.L. Farese Jr., R.V. Sheppard D.

On gross inspection, the thoracic duct and peripheral lymphatic vessels were present, but their integrity was compromised, as evidenced by chylothoraces and edema of the thoracic dermis, skeletal muscle, and pleural surface. To date the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of α9β1 in lymphatic development and/or function remain unexplained.

The importance of these VEGF proteins in lymphangiogenesis was demonstrated by their transgenic overexpression in skin, resulting in dermal lymphatic hyperplasia, which could be blocked by soluble VEGF-R3-Ig (23Veikkola T.

Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that the lymphatic abnormality in α9 knock-out mice could be explained by an interaction between α9β1 and VEGF-C and/or -D. To address this question we used α9-transfected cell lines and primary microvascular endothelial cells to assess in vitro cell adhesion, migration, and receptor signaling and purified α9β1 and VEGF-C or -D protein for solid phase binding assays. We found that α9-transfected cells and primary microvascular endothelial cells, which endogenously express α9β1, utilize α9β1 to adhere to and migrate on VEGF-C and -D. This effect was inhibited by the specific α9β1-blocking antibody Y9A2 and siRNA silencing of α9 protein expression. Furthermore, VEGF-C and -D directly bound to α9β1 in a solid phase protein binding assay and activated α9β1 signaling, as evidenced by Erk 1/2 and paxillin phosphorylation that was inhibited by anti-α9β1 antibody. These novel findings therefore identify the growth factors VEGF-C and -D as ligands for α9β1 and provide a potential explanation for the abnormal lymphatic phenotype of the α9 knock-out mouse. Materials—Human VEGF-C and -D were purchased from R&D Systems. Rabbit anti-human antibody to VEGF-C was purchased from IBL (Gunma, Japan). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to VEGF-R3 (M-20) and rabbit anti-human antibody to VEGF-D (sc-13085) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse IgG, phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse, and biotinylated rat anti-mouse antibodies and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Cells and Cell Culture—α9- and mock-transfected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and SW-480 cells were made as described previously (8Young B.A. Taooka Y. Liu S. Askins K.J. Yokosaki Y. Thomas S.M.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), and stable clones maintained with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin (Invitrogen, MEF) or 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma, SW-480). Primary adult human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC, Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) were grown in cell-specific growth factor-supplemented nutrient media (Cambrex, EBM-2). Schneider Drosophila S2 cells (Invitrogen) used for production of recombinant VEGF-C and -D proteins were grown in Schneider S2 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 27 °C and no CO2. Stable clones were maintained in 25 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). Synthesis and Purification of VEGF-C and -D—The cDNAs encoding the fully processed and active forms of VEGF-C (GenBank™ accession number NM-005429) and VEGF-D (GenBank™ accession number NM-004469) were expressed in Schneider Drosophila S2 cells (Invitrogen). The following primers were used to introduce 5′ NcoI and 3′ XbaI restriction sites for cloning into the multiple cloning site of the insect expression vector pCoBlast/MT/BiP/V5-His (Invitrogen): 5′ VEGF-D, 5′-gcagccatggtttgcggcaactttc-3′; 3′ VEGF-D, 5′-cgatctagatcttctgataattgagtatg-3′; 5′ VEGF-C, 5′-gcgaccatgggcacattataatacag-3′; and 3′ VEGF-C, 5′-cggtctagaacgtctaataatggaatg-3′. S2 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. Individual clones were isolated by limiting dilution in 25 μg/ml blasticidin and screened by Western blotting cell supernatants with anti-V5 antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (V5-HRP, Invitrogen). Transfected S2 cells were initially grown in 15-cm culture plates (Corning) and then transferred to 1-liter spinner flasks (Corning) for 5 days in reduced serum conditions. Protein secretion was induced with 500 μm CuSO4 (Sigma) for 5 days. The supernatant was collected following centrifugation (3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and then filtered, dialyzed, and concentrated (Vivaflow 200, VivaScience Inc., Carlsbad, CA) in binding buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Na2PO4, pH 8.0). Concentrated supernatant containing VEGF-C or -D was then applied to a Ni2+ column (ProBond, Invitrogen), and the column was washed with binding buffer containing 50 μm imidazole to remove contaminating proteins; the bound VEGF was eluted with buffer containing 300 μm imidazole. The eluents were then dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Purity was assessed by silver staining (GelCode SilverSNAP, Pierce). Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blot Analysis—For immunoprecipitation of VEGF-R3, HMVEC were grown in 6-well plates with full growth medium until 70% confluent and subsequently in basal medium with 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 4 h. VEGF-C or -D was then added to the cells for 5 min, and the cells were washed with PBS/sodium orthovanadate (NaVi 10 mm) and then lysed with buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVi, and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the precleared lysates immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of rabbit anti-VEGF-R3 antibody bound to 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 6 min, resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membrane was blocked in 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. For immunoblotting of VEGF-C, VEGF-D, α9β1, Erk 1/2, and paxillin, proteins were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on 15, 10, or 8% SDS-PAGE before transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with the appropriate specific primary antibodies, washed three times with TBST, and subsequently probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For analysis of Erk 1/2 and paxillin phosphorylation, SW-480 cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in full growth media and then treated with 20 μg/ml of cycloheximide. Cells were trypsinized, kept in suspension for 2 h in 6-well plates coated with 1% BSA (Sigma). Subsequently, 1 × 106 cells/ml untreated or pretreated with relevant blocking antibodies were seeded into separate 6-well plates coated with either 1% BSA, VEGF-C or -D (3 μg/ml), or Tnfn3RAA (2.5 μg/ml). Tnfn3RAA is an α9β1-specific ligand, which is a recombinant form of the third fibronectin type 3 repeat of tenascin C in which the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid sequence is mutated to RAA, as described previously (25Prieto A.L.

After 60 min, cells were washed with PBS/NaVi (1 mm) and then lysed with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X, 25 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVi, and protease inhibitors (complete mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 g at 4 °C for 10 min, and Western blotting was performed as outlined above. Flow Cytometry—Cultured cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, blocked with normal goat serum at 4 °C for 10 min, incubated with primary antibody for 20 min at 4 °C and then with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. Labeled cells were suspended in PBS, and fluorescence was determined for 5,000 cells with a flow cytometer (FACSort, BD Biosciences). Primary mouse monoclonal antibody Y9A2 (Wang, 1996 (10 μg/ml)), was used to detect α9β1 and 9D9f9 (5 μg/ml, gift from Dr. K. Alitalo) to detect VEGF-R3. Adhesion Assay—96-well non-tissue culture flat-bottomed microtiter plates (ICN, Linbro/Titertek, Aurora, OH) were coated with VEGF-C or -D at 4 °C overnight and then blocked with 1% BSA (Sigma) in DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C. After trypsinization cells were incubated with or without the α9β1-blocking antibody Y9A2 (20 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice, and 5 × 104 cells/well were seeded (8Young B.A. Taooka Y. Liu S. Askins K.J. Yokosaki Y. Thomas S.M. Sheppard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3214-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Control wells were treated with 1% BSA in DMEM. The plates were centrifuged (top side up) at 10 × g for 5 min and incubated for 1 h (MEF) or 2 h (HMVEC) at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by centrifugation (top side down) for 5 min at 48 × g, and adherent cells were fixed and stained with 1% formaldehyde, 0.5% crystal violet, and 20% methanol for 30 min after which the wells were washed three times with PBS. Following solubilization in 2% Triton X-100, the number of adherent cells was evaluated by measuring absorbance at 595 nm in a microplate reader (Spectra-Max 190, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Migration Assay—The undersurfaces of 12-well, 8-μm Transwell plates (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with the relevant ligand (VEGF-C or -D) or 1% BSA as a binding control at 4 °C overnight. Wells were then washed with PBS and blocked with 1% BSA in DMEM or PBS for 60 min at 37 °C. After trypsinization, 5 × 104 cells in DMEM were incubated with or without Y9A2 and/or MAZ51 for 30 min on ice and then seeded into the top chamber of the Transwell (8Young B.A. Taooka Y. Liu S. Askins K.J. Yokosaki Y. Thomas S.M. Sheppard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3214-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 1% fetal calf serum was added to the bottom well to serve as a chemoattractant, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells that migrated and adhered to the bottom surface of the Transwell membrane were fixed with DiffQuik fixative (Pierce), and the non-adherent cells were gently removed from the top with a Q-tip. After air drying, the membranes were stained with DiffQuik (Pierce), washed in water, and air-dried, and then the membranes were cut from the Transwell and mounted onto glass slides. Cells were counted in 10 high power (×25) fields for each condition. RNA Silencing of α9β1—HMVEC were grown in 10-cm dishes with full growth media (Cambrex) until 70% confluent. Cells were then washed twice with serum-free media and transfected with siRNA (20 μm, Ambion, catalog no. 86946) targeted to exon 4 of the α9 integrin using siPort Amine (Ambion) in Opti-MEM media. Cell media were replaced with full growth media 6 h after transfection and daily thereafter. Transfection efficiency was assessed by flow cytometry analysis of α9β1 expression 48–72 h after transfection and compared with mock and untransfected cells of the same passage. Cell adhesion assays using VEGF-C or VEGF-D as substrate were performed using transfected cells in which α9β1 was successfully silenced and compared with untransfected and transfected cells in which α9β1 was not silenced. Production of Non-blocking Monoclonal Antibody to α9β1—A non-blocking antibody to α9β1 was produced for detection of integrin bound to the VEGF protein in binding assays. Murine L2 cells (ATCC) transfected with human α9 were injected into mice every 14 days for a total of three injections. 3 days after the final injection, lymphocytes were harvested and spin-combined with SP2/0 myeloma cells as described previously (27Wang A. Yokosaki Y. Ferrando R. Balmes J. Sheppard D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). After addition of selection media (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% sodium pyruvate, l-glutamine), single clones were selected, and the supernatants were screened by differential flow cytometry of mock- and α9-transfected cells. Antibody was purified by gradient anion exchange. Metabolic Labeling of Cells and Immunoprecipitation—To determine whether A9A1 was able to immunoprecipitate the α9β1 integrin efficiently, α9-transfected SW-480 cells were grown for 4 h in methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and then incubated with 0.5 mCi of 35S for 24 h. Lysates of cells labeled with [35S]methionine were then precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared supernatant was incubated with 20 μg of the primary antibody A9A1 at 4 °C overnight. The beads and bound protein were washed four times with buffer containing 100 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS and then boiled in reducing Laemmli's buffer at 95 °C for 6 min. Protein samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography was performed after 1 week at –80 °C. Immunoaffinity Purification of Human Integrin α9β1—α9-Transfected SW-480 cells (24Yokosaki Y.

After centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min) and filtering, lysate containing α9β1 was applied to an α9 antibody (A9A1) column. The column was washed with wash buffer (20 mm N-octylglucosylpyranoside, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2) and a second time with wash buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. Bound integrin was eluted in 150 mm NaCl at pH 3.0 into microcentrifuge tubes containing Tris, pH 9.0, to bring the final pH to 7.4. Eluents were analyzed for α9β1 by Western blotting with the rabbit polyclonal antibody 1057 (5Palmer E.L. Ruegg C. Ferrando R. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Immunoaffinity Purification of Human Integrin αvβ6—Secreted αvβ6 integrin was collected from conditioned media of Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with truncated forms of each subunit of the integrin as described previously (28Weinacker A. Chen A. Agrez M. Cone R.I. Nishimura S. Wayner E. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6940-6948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The integrin was purified using immunoaffinity chromatography on columns with the αvβ6 antibody R6G9 covalently cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 3, into 0.05 volume of 1 m Na2PO4, pH 8 (29Munger J.S. Huang X. Kawakatsu H. Griffiths M.J. Dalton S.L. Wu J. Pittet J.F. Kaminski N. Garat C.

Binding Assay—Direct binding of VEGF-C and -D to α9β1 was assessed by a solid phase binding assay in non-tissue-coated 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc ImmunoPlate, Naperville, IL). Recombinant VEGF-C or -D (5 μg/ml) was attached to the plates, and purified α9β1 was added for 2 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of 10 mm EDTA. Following five washes with PBS/1% BSA/0.05% Tween, the extent of α9β1 binding was detected using the A9A1 antibody (20 μg/ml, 1 h at 37 °C). After incubation with biotinylated rat anti-mouse antibody (1:250, 1 h, room temperature), streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase was added for 20 min at room temperature followed by 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution (Pharmingen). Absorbance was then measured at 450 nm with a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The functional integrity of the purified α9β1 integrin was assessed in a similar assay using the α9β1-specific ligand Tnfn3RAA (5 μg/ml) as described previously (25Prieto A.L. Edelman G.M.

Statistical Methods—For statistical analysis of adhesion and migration assays comparisons were made by analysis of variance with a post-hoc Tukey's test. Statistical significance was assumed at p ≤ 0.05 with respect to a two-tailed probability distribution. Data are presented as mean values ± S.E. unless otherwise stated from at least three separate experiments. Production and Purification of VEGF-C and -D—Fully processed VEGF-C and -D proteins were purified from transfected Drosophila S2 cells. Western blots (Fig. 1A) of secreted and purified VEGF-C (top panel) and VEGF-D (bottom panel) with anti-V5 antibody (left panels) demonstrate proteins with the expected molecular mass for VEGF-C (or -D) tagged with V5 and His (∼23–24 kDa). In addition, immunoblotting with VEGF-C- and -D-specific antibodies (right panels) showed that the V5-tagged proteins were indeed VEGF-C and -D. The purity of each recombinant protein was determined by silver staining of 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as shown in Fig. 1B. VEGF-C and -D-V5 induced phosphorylation of their cognate receptor, VEGF-R3. Fig. 1C shows the expected VEGF-R3 isoforms and confirms the activity of the purified VEGF proteins.Fig. 1Production and purification of VEGF-C and -D proteins. VEGF-C and -D were purified from supernatant of transfected Drosophila S2 cells by Ni2+ affinity chromatography.

https://openalex.org/W2094280432,"The functional significance of mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of lysine residues within histone proteins is under investigation. Evidence from several model organisms suggests that different methylated states of H3 Lys9 (H3K9) are generated by specific histone methyltransferases (MTases) to mark distinct types of silent chromatin. Sequence alignment of all histone lysine MTases with known product specificity suggested that a key residue in the active site determines how many methyl groups they add. We examined this possibility both in vitro and in vivo and found that a Phe at the position equivalent to Phe281 of Neurospora crassa DIM-5 or Phe1205 of human G9a allows the enzyme to perform di and tri-methylation, whereas a Tyr at this position is restrictive, inhibiting tri-methylation and thus yielding a mono- or di-MTase. Phe to Tyr mutants of both DIM-5 and G9a restrict product specificity in vitro and in vivo without compromising overall catalysis. These mutants were employed to probe the biological significance of mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of H3K9 in both mouse embryonic stem cells and N. crassa. G9a F1205Y, when expressed in G9a (–/–) embryonic stem cells, rescued only H3K9 mono-methylation, but not di-methylation, to wild-type levels yet silenced Mage-a gene expression. When expressed in dim-5 strains, DIM-5 F281Y generated significant levels of mono- and di-H3K9 methylation (which are not observed in wild type Neurospora) as well as tri-methyl H3K9. The altered DIM-5 rescued the growth defect characteristic of dim-5 N. crassa but did not fully rescue the gross DNA hypomethylation of dim-5 strains.

Histones are subject to diverse post-translational modifications including acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, methylation, and sumoylation. Evidence accumulated over the past few years suggests that such modifications constitute a “histone code” that directs a variety of processes involving chromatin (1Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7580) Google Scholar, 2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6536) Google Scholar). Considering just methylation of lysines, there are at least six modification sites (Lys4, Lys9, Lys27, Lys36, and Lys79 of histone H3 and Lys20 of histone H4), and in principle each site can have zero, one, two, or three methyl groups. It has been suggested that methylation at these sites, in combination with other nearby modifications, generates “modification cassettes” (3Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D.

In this study we focus on two members of the SUV family that methylate Lys9 of histone H3, G9a characterized in mammals and DIM-5 characterized in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. DIM-5 provided the first evidence that histone methylation can direct DNA methylation (7Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Nature. 2001; 414: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). DIM-5 normally generates primarily tri-methyl-Lys9 on histone H3 (8Tamaru H. Zhang X. McMillen D. Singh P.B. Nakayama J. Grewal S.I. Allis C.D. Cheng X. Selker E.U. Nat.

G9a is essential for early embryogenesis and is the predominant H3 Lys9 HKMT that directs euchromatic mono- and di-methylation (10Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol.

G9a apparently plays key roles in later development, because its activity is required for PRDI-BF1 (BLIMP-1) silencing in terminal B-cell differentiation (13Gyory I. Wu J. Fejer G. Seto E.

With the advent of antibodies specific for mono-, di-, or tri-methylation of various lysines, it became increasingly evident that product specificity can be important for generating distinct regulatory signals (11Peters A.H.

For example, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SET-1 can di- or tri-methylate H3 Lys4, but only tri-methylation is associated with the early stage of active transcription; di-methylation is globally distributed (21Santos-Rosa H.

Mouse Suv39h specifically tri-methylates H3K9 at pericentric heterochromatin, whereas centromeric regions display Suv39h-independent di-methylation (4Lachner M. O'Sullivan R.J. Jenuwein T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 19Lehnertz B. Ueda Y. Derijck A.A. Braunschweig U. Perez-Burgos L. Kubicek S. Chen T. Li E. Jenuwein T. Peters A.H. Curr.

Fang J. Mlynarczyk-Evans S.K. Cao R. Worringer K.A. Wang H. de la Cruz C.C. Otte A.P. Panning B. Zhang Y. Science. 2003; 300: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). In contrast to DIM-5, which tri-methylates Lys9 of histone H3 to mark chromatin regions for DNA methylation (8Tamaru H. Zhang X. McMillen D. Singh P.B. Nakayama J. Grewal S.I. Allis C.D. Cheng X. Selker E.U. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), in Arabidopsis thaliana, the KRYP-TONITE HKMT dimethylates Lys9 (25Jackson J.P. Johnson L. Jasencakova Z. Zhang X. PerezBurgos L. Singh P.B. Cheng X. Schubert I. Jenuwein T. Jacobsen S.E. Chromosoma. 2004; 112: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). By comparing the active sites of SET7/9 (a mono-MTase) and DIM-5 (a tri-MTase), we designed point mutations in both enzymes that profoundly altered their product specificities without affecting their catalytic activities (9Zhang X. Yang Z. Khan S.I. Horton J.R. Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Cheng X. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This led us to propose that a few key residues in the active site of HKMTs determine how many methyl groups they add, and the product specificity may be predictable from their primary sequences. We show that G9a forms mono- and di-methyl Lys9 as initial products and then slowly adds the third methyl group, consistent with reports that G9a is a global mono- and di-MTase (11Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. Martens J.H. Jenuwein T. Mol.

Shinkai Y. Krangel M.S. Oltz E.M. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We also demonstrate that a single point mutation, F1205Y, converts G9a to a mono-MTase. When expressed in G9a (–/–) ES cells, the F1205Y mutant rescues mono-, but not di-methyl H3K9 levels, yet represses Mage-a gene expression to wild-type levels. Similarly, the F281Y mutant of DIM-5, when expressed in a dim-5 null background, yields significant levels of mono- and di-methyl H3K9 that are not observed in the wild-type Neurospora. The presence of the mono- and di-methyl marks is incompatible with the function of DIM-5 in maintaining normal DNA cytosine methylation. In contrast, the remaining tri-methylation and/or the increased levels of mono- and di-methylation by the F281Y mutant is sufficient to rescue the characteristic growth defect of the dim-5 strain. Protein Expression and Purification—A fragment encoding the C-terminal 280 residues of human G9a was amplified from an expressed sequence tag clone BC002686 (Resgen) and subcloned between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEx2T (Amersham Biosciences), yielding pXC428. BL21(DE3) Codon-Plus RIL (Stratagene) cells harboring pXC428 were grown in LB supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin, 50 mg/liter chloramphenicol, and 25 μm ZnSO4 at 37 °C until A600 = 0.5. The culture was shifted to 16 °C and induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, lysed with a French press, and applied to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in a batch slurry. Thrombin cleavage of the glutathione S-transferase tag was performed on the beads, yielding the G9a catalytic domain following four residues: GSHM from the vector. Eluted protein was concentrated to 1 mg/ml, flash frozen, and stored at –80 °C in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. DIM-5 was expressed and purified as described (27Zhang X. Tamaru H. Khan S.I. Horton J.R. Keefe L.J. Selker E.U. Cheng X. Cell. 2002; 111: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The human G9a amino acid, corresponding to 1205 of the G9a mouse long isoform (10Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), in pXC428 was converted from Phe (TTT) to Tyr (TAT), yielding pXC444. The construct was fully sequenced to confirm the desired mutation and the lack of unintended mutations. Generation of DIM-5 mutants Y178V and F281Y has been described (9Zhang X. Yang Z. Khan S.I. Horton J.R. Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Cheng X. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Methylation reactions for G9a were performed in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μmS-adenosyl-l-methionine, 10 μm peptide (H3 amino acids 1–15, 1–24, or 21–34), and 0.1 mg/ml enzyme at room temperature. For DIM-5, 20 μm of peptide and 0.02 mg/ml of the enzyme were used. The reactions were stopped at various times by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to 0.5%. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on an Applied Biosystem Voyager System 4258 (Emory University Chemistry Department) with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. The final spectra are the averages of 200 shots/position at 10 different positions. Construction of Neurospora Strains That Carry a dim-5 Nonsense Mutation at the dim-5 Locus and the dim-5WT, dim-5Y178V, or dim-5F281Y Allele at the his-3 Locus—A fragment containing 165 bp of 5′-noncoding sequence and the entire open reading frame of the dim-5 gene was amplified from a N. crassa wild-type strain (N1) by PCR with Herculase polymerase (Stratagene) and a pair of primers, oligonucleotide 1282 (5′-CGGAATTCTTACCACAGATAGCCTCTGCACTT-3′) and oligonucleotide 1283 (5′-CGGGATCCACGCTAAGCCATCTTTCTCTCTCA-3′). The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, gel-purified, and cloned into a his-3 targeting vector, pBM61 (28Margolin B.S. Garrett-Engele P.W. Stevens J.N. Fritz D.Y.

A BglII fragment carrying the wild-type dim-5 sequence in pHT15 was replaced with the corresponding dim-5 fragment from pXC379F281Y or from pXC379Y178V (9Zhang X. Yang Z. Khan S.I. Horton J.R. Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Cheng X. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), yielding pHT16 and pHT17, respectively. The dim-5 null strain N2264 (mat a his-3; leu-2 dim-5HT1pan-1) was transformed by electroporation (28Margolin B.S. Garrett-Engele P.W. Stevens J.N. Fritz D.Y. Garrett-Engele C. Metzenberg R.L.

Correctly targeted constructs at his-3 in the resulting transformant strains were verified by Southern hybridizations probed with a his-3 fragment. PCR Primers—Pairs of PCR primers used to amplify fragments of pcn (470 bp), hH4 (425 bp), 1d21 (355 bp), 8A6 (302 bp), and 8F10 (316 bp) were: 560 pcn-FWD (ATGCTTGAAGCACGGTTGGAG), 561 pcn-REV (CCCAGGTGCTCCTGGTCAATG); 557 hH4-FWD (AACCACCGAAACCGTAGAGGGTAC), and 562 hH4-REV (ATCGCCGACACCGTGTGTTGTAAC); 1d21-FWD (5′-GTTCGGTTCCTCTGTCTTCCTTG-3′) and 1d21-REV-2 5′-CGC CGC ACA GAA TAT TAT AGC TAT C-3′; 8A6-FWD 5′-GGA TGG CGG ATC CTC AAA AAT A-3′ and 8A6-REV 5′-TAA CCG CCG CTT TTT AAA ATT AGG A-3′; and 8F10-FWD 5′-GTA ACG CAA ATT CTA AAA TTG CAA TAC-3′ and 8F10-REV 5′-CTT AGT AAT TAA TTT AAT ACG TGC GCC-3′. Western Analysis of DIM-5 Variants—We germinated asexual spores (∼5 × 106 spores/ml) of the Neurospora strain N150 (mat A), N2264 (mat a leu-2 dim-5HT1 pan-1), N2732 (mat a his-3+::dim-5WT; leu-2 dim-5HT1 pan-1) N2738 (mat a his-3+::dim-5F281Y; leu-2 dim-5HT1 pan-1), or N2744 (mat a his-3+::dim-5Y178V; leu-2 dim-5HT1 pan-1)for 16hin25 ml of Vogel's minimal liquid medium supplemented with 1.5% sucrose, leucine, and pantothenic acid at 32 °C with shaking (150 rpm). 100 mg of tissue was quick frozen at –70 °C and then disrupted by bead beating in breaking buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The soluble fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE (12%) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 10 mm 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid, pH 11, 20% methanol. Immunoblotting was performed using standard techniques. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against recombinant DIM-5 was affinity-purified using recombinant DIM-5 protein coupled to NHS-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation as described previously (8Tamaru H. Zhang X. McMillen D. Singh P.B. Nakayama J. Grewal S.I. Allis C.D. Cheng X. Selker E.U. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, we germinated asexual spores (∼5 × 106 spores/ml) of the Neurospora strain N2732 (mat a his-3+::dim-5WT; leu-2 dim-5HT1 pan-1) or N2738 (mat his-3+::dim-5F281Y; leu-2 dim-5HT1 pan-1) for 4.5 h in 50 ml of Vogel's minimal liquid medium supplemented with 1.5% sucrose, leucine, and panthothenic acid at 32 °C with shaking (200 rpm). For chromatin fixation, paraformaldehyde was added to 2% and incubated at 32 °C for 30 min with shaking (100 rpm). After cell lysis, we sheared chromatin DNA to 0.5–0.8 kb and immunoprecipitated the soluble chromatin fraction using 2–8 μl of antibodies to mono-, di-, or tri-methylated Lys9 or dimethylated Lys4 of histone H3. Antibodies to methylated H3K9 were obtained from T. Jenuwein of University of Vienna (mono-methylated), Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (di-methylated), and P. B. Singh of Roslin Institute (tri-methylated) and the antibody to methylated H3K4 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. DNA was isolated from immunoprecipitated chromatin or total chromatin and subjected to PCR (95 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 24 cycles). PCRs (25 μl) included 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dATP, 0.2 mm dTTP, 0.2 mm dCTP, 0.2 mm dGTP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P] dCTP, a 0.5-μl sample DNA, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Promega). Under the chosen PCR conditions, a linear relationship was found between the amount of input DNA and the band intensities of PCR products (8Tamaru H. Zhang X. McMillen D. Singh P.B. Nakayama J.

Western Analysis of Neurospora Histone H3—Neurospora nuclei were isolated from N2732 (mat a his-3+::dim-5WT; leu-2 dim-5HT1 pan-1), N2744 (mat a his-3+::dim-5Y178V; leu-2 dim-5HT1 pan-1) or N2738 (mat his-3+::dim-5F281Y; leu-2 dim-5HT1 pan-1) strains and lysed in the buffer used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis (29Nakayama J. Klar A.J. Grewal S.I. Cell. 2000; 101: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Nuclear lysates (∼25 μg of nuclear proteins) were boiled in SDS gel loading buffer, clarified by centrifugation, fractionated by SDS-PAGE (18%), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 10 mm 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid, pH 11, containing 20% methanol at 70 V for 2 h, and immunoblotted as described previously (8Tamaru H.

Calf thymus histones (Roche Applied Science) were included as control (2.5 μg). Obtained antibodies to methylated H3K9 were described in the previous section. Analysis of DNA Methylation—Genomic DNA was isolated from liquid cultures grown for 2 days at 32 °C and analyzed for DNA methylation as described (30Foss H.M. Roberts C.J. Claeys K.M. Selker E.U. Science. 1993; 262: 1737-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The DNA (∼1 μg) was digested with DpnII or Sau3AI and analyzed by Southern hybridization. Probes for methylated DNA regions 1d21, 8A6, and 8F10 used were PCR products generated with the primer pairs described above. G9a ES Cells—Undifferentiated ES cells were maintained in 10% fetal calf serum and leukemia-inducing factor (500 units/ml)-containing medium. G9a long isoform (G9a-L) cDNA carrying the F1205Y mutation was generated by conventional double PCR mutagenesis and subcloned into the expression vector, pCAGGS. The G9a-L F1205Y expression vector was introduced into ES cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manual. G9a Is a Fast Mono/di-MTase and a Slow Tri-MTase—We have previously used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to monitor the kinetic progression of methylation reactions and determined that DIM-5 is a tri-MTase and SET7/9 is a mono-MTase (8Tamaru H. Zhang X. McMillen D. Singh P.B. Nakayama J. Grewal S.I. Allis C.D. Cheng X. Selker E.U. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 9Zhang X. Yang Z. Khan S.I. Horton J.R. Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Cheng X. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Here we report a similar investigation of the product specificity of the G9a catalytic domain by monitoring the methylation of a synthetic histone H3 peptide, residues H3 1–24 (Fig. 1B) or H3 1–15 (Fig. 2, left panels), by mass spectrometry. G9a produced both mono- and di-methylated peptides early in the reaction. Di-methylated H3K9 was the dominant form after about 1 min on both the 1–24 and 1–15 peptides, shortly after a burst of mono-methyl product coincident with the rapid disappearance of unmethylated peptides. Notably, tri-methylated H3K9 was first detected only after the di-methyl product was maximal and both un-modified and mono-methylated peptides had disappeared. The conversion of di- to tri-methyl lysine was much slower, not becoming complete until after 30 min in both cases. These observations suggest that mono and di-methyl H3K9 are the initial products of G9a. This is in sharp contrast to DIM-5, which shows a direct progression to tri-methyl lysine without significant accumulation of di-methyl lysine (8Tamaru H. Zhang X. McMillen D. Singh P.B. Nakayama J.

Interestingly, our results suggest G9a could generate tri-methyl H3K9 at regions where it has high local concentrations. In fact, G9a tethered to a synthetic mini-locus as a Gal4DBD fusion generates tri-methyl lysine in vivo (26Osipovich O. Milley R. Meade A. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. Krangel M.S. Oltz E.M. Nat.

Whether G9a makes trimethyl-H3K9 under normal circumstances in vivo remains to be determined.Fig. 2Generation of mono-methyl H3K9 (H3 amino acids 1–15) by G9a F1205Y variant without impaired catalytic ability.A–C, representative mass spectra (from a single reaction) at various time points for WT G9a (left panels) and F1205Y (right panels).

We found that G9a has very poor activity on this lysine, some 100-fold worse than on peptides of similar length that include Lys9. Nevertheless, G9a did produce mono- and di-methyl H3K27 simultaneously in the early stages of the reaction and very slowly generated tri-methyl Lys27 (∼24 h). This low activity is consistent with the finding that methyl-H3K27 levels are unaffected in G9a (–/–) ES cells (11Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L.

https://openalex.org/W2120127860,"Aggregation of the nerve cell protein α-synuclein is a characteristic of the common neurodegenerative α-synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia, and it plays a direct pathogenic role as demonstrated by early onset diseases caused by mis-sense mutations and multiplication of the α-synuclein gene. We investigated the existence of α-synuclein pro-aggregatory brain proteins whose dysregulation may contribute to disease progression, and we identified the brain-specific p25α as a candidate that preferentially binds to α-synuclein in its aggregated state. Functionally, purified recombinant human p25α strongly stimulates the aggregation of α-synuclein <i>in vitro</i> as demonstrated by thioflavin-T fluorescence and quantitative electron microscopy. p25α is normally only expressed in oligodendrocytes in contrast to α-synuclein, which is normally only expressed in neurons. This expression pattern is changed in α-synucleinopathies. In multiple systems atrophy, degenerating oligodendrocytes displayed accumulation of p25α and dystopically expressed α-synuclein in the glial cytoplasmic inclusions. In Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia, p25α was detectable in the neuronal Lewy body inclusions along with α-synuclein. The localization in α-synuclein-containing inclusions was verified biochemically by immunological detection in Lewy body inclusions purified from Lewy body dementia tissue and glial cytoplasmic inclusions purified from tissue from multiple systems atrophy. We suggest that p25α plays a pro-aggregatory role in the common neurodegenerative disorders hall-marked by α-synuclein aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W2076760898,"A novel bacterial putrescine utilization pathway was discovered. Seven genes, the functions of whose products were not known, are involved in this novel pathway. Five of them encode enzymes that catabolize putrescine; one encodes a putrescine importer, and the other encodes a transcriptional regulator. This novel pathway involves six sequential steps as follows: 1) import of putrescine; 2) ATP-dependent γ-glutamylation of putrescine; 3) oxidization of γ-glutamylputrescine; 4) dehydrogenation of γ-glutamyl-γ-aminobutyraldehyde; 5) hydrolysis of the γ-glutamyl linkage of γ-glutamyl-γ-aminobutyrate; and 6) transamination of γ-aminobutyrate to form the final product of this pathway, succinate semialdehyde, which is the precursor of succinate.

For example, glutathione (γ-glutamylcysteinylglycine) is a very important antioxidant (1Mannervik B. Carlberg I. Larson K. Dolphin D. Rozanne P. Avramovic O. Coenzymes and Cofactors. 3. Wiley-Interscience, New York1989: 475-516Google Scholar) for living cells. We have studied bacterial γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) 1The abbreviations used are: GGT, γ-glutamyltranspeptidase; γ-Glu-Put, γ-glutamylputrescine; γ-Glu-GABA, γ-glutamyl-γ-aminobutyrate; GABA, γ-aminobutyrate; γ-GpNA, γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide; IPA, isopropylamine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; GabT, GABA aminotransferase; GabD, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6038-6040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the course of our study on Escherichia coli GGT, we unexpectedly found that the γ-glutamyl linkage of γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide (γ-GpNA) was cleaved by the cell-free extract of a GGT-deficient strain. The enzyme that is responsible for this reaction was purified, and the relevant gene, ycjL, was identified. Further study of ycjL and neighboring genes (ycj gene cluster) revealed that the products of the ycj gene cluster constitute a novel putrescine-utilizing pathway in which γ-Glu-Put is involved. Putrescine, the substrate of this pathway, is one of polyamines that are found in a wide range of organisms from bacteria to plants and animals especially when these cells are proliferating or in stressful conditions (5Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). Also in E. coli, putrescine plays important roles in cell proliferation and normal cell growth (5Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). Putrescine is synthesized from ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase (SpeC) or from arginine by the sequential actions of arginine decarboxylase (SpeA) and agmatinase (SpeB) in E. coli cells (6Boyle S.M. Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Wright J.M. Tabor H. Tabor C.W. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 30: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Putrescine is converted to spermidine, another polyamine, by the addition of an aminopropyl group derived from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine through the activity of spermidine synthase (SpeE) (7Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Xie Q.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6040-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Putrescine has been reported to be converted to γ-aminobutyraldehyde by putrescine transaminase and then to be oxidized to γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) by aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (8Shaibe E. Metzer E. Halpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 933-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither of the genes encoding this pathway has been identified yet. GABA is converted to succinate semialdehyde by GABA aminotransferase (GabT) and then is oxidized to succinate by succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (GabD) (9Metzer E. Levitz R. Halpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the ΔgabT strain grew in minimal medium containing putrescine as a sole nitrogen source but not in minimal medium containing GABA instead of putrescine (10Schneider B.L. Ruback S. Kiupakis A.K. Kasbarian H. Pybus C. Reitzer L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6976-6986Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This unexpected growth in the presence of putrescine likely resulted from the specific induction of a gab-independent enzyme by putrescine. It was reported that an excess amount of putrescine is exported by PotE, putrescine ornithine antiporter (11Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Suzuki F. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4529-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and that putrescine outside of the cell is imported by PotFGHI, the ABC transporter (12Pistocchi R. Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Sadakata Y. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 146-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), according to the environment in which E. coli lives. In this paper we report on a completely new catabolic pathway for extracellular putrescine. This pathway involves the γ-glutamylation of putrescine and plays an important physiological role to utilize putrescine in nutrient starvation. All the enzymes, a transporter, and a regulator that constitute this pathway are encoded by the ycj gene cluster. 2The relationship between gene designations and their products is summarized in Table II. Media and Reagents—Strains were grown in M9-tryptone (M9 minimal medium (13Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics.

The gradient of the mobile phase was formed with buffer A (66.6 mm tri-sodium citrate dehydrate, 1% perchloric acid, 7% ethanol (pH 3.2)) and buffer B (200 mm tri-sodium citrate dehydrate, 200 mm boric acid, 0.12 n NaOH (pH 10)). The concentration of buffer B was kept at 0% until 9 min. It was linearly increased to 7% from 9 to 13 min, to 8% from 13 to 17.2 min, and then to 11%. o-Phthalaldehyde was used as the detection reagent (19Benson J.R. Hare P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) as described previously (20Suzuki H. Izuka S. Minami H. Miyakawa N. Ishihara S. Kumagai H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 6399-6404Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the fluorescence was detected with a fluorescence detector (model RF-535; Shimadzu) as the absorbance at 450 nm, with excitation at 348 nm. Standard compounds were purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan, and Sigma, except for γ-Glu-Put and γ-Glu-GABA, which were synthesized as described below. In our HPLC system, γ-Glu-GABA, glutamate, GABA, and γ-Glu-Put was eluted at 8, 11, 26, and 29 min, respectively. Before measuring amino acids from the cell-free extract, the extract was previously treated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 10%) to precipitate its proteins. Assays for Enzymes—The γ-GpNA hydrolysis activity of YcjL and GGT was assayed as described previously (2Suzuki H. Kumagai H. Tochikura T. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). γ-Glu-Put synthetase activity was determined by measuring the γ-Glu-Put synthesized from glutamate and putrescine. The reaction mixture containing 50 mm sodium glutamate, 50 mm putrescine dihydrochloride, 15 mm ATP, 60 mm MgCl2, and 200 mm imidazole chloride buffer (pH 7.0) was incubated at 37 °C. γ-Glu-Put oxidase activity was assayed by measuring the decrease in γ-Glu-Put by HPLC. The reaction mixture containing 1 mm γ-Glu-Put and 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was incubated at 37 °C. γ-Glu-GABA hydrolase activity was determined by measuring the glutamate released from γ-Glu-GABA. The reaction mixture containing various concentrations of γ-Glu-GABA and 50 mm imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 8.7) was incubated at 37 °C. GABA aminotransferase activity was determined by measuring the glutamate formed from GABA and α-ketoglutarate. The reaction mixture containing 10 mm GABA, 10 mm α-ketoglutarate monosodium salt, and 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was incubated at 37 °C. Adding trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 10%) terminated the reactions, and the filtrates were analyzed with HPLC. Purification of Proteins—Following the γ-GpNA hydrolysis activity, YcjL was purified from the cell-free extract of SH639 (Δggt-2) by ammonium sulfate precipitation (30–50%) and column chromatographies using DEAE-Cellulofine A-500m (Chisso, Tokyo, Japan), phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences), Cellulofine GC-700m (Chisso), and MiniQ (Amersham Biosciences). During the purification, the protein was basically dissolved in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.7) and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). After the ammonium sulfate precipitation, the enzyme was dissolved in buffer C and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialyzed enzyme solution was applied to DEAE-Cellulofine A-500m previously equilibrated with buffer C. Without washing the column, YcjL was eluted with 0.2 m NaCl in buffer C from the column. In the purification step using phenyl-Sepharose CL4B, the enzyme solution was dialyzed against buffer D (0.8 m ammonium sulfate in buffer C) and applied to the column equilibrated with buffer D. The column was washed with buffer D, and YcjL was eluted at the end of a liner gradient formed between buffer D (0.8 m ammonium sulfate in buffer C) and buffer E (40% ethylene glycol in buffer C). In the purification step using Cellulofine GC-700, the enzyme solution was concentrated by the ammonium sulfate precipitation and applied to the column previously equilibrated with buffer C. The active fraction was applied to the MiniQ column previously equilibrated with buffer C. YcjL was eluted with a linear gradient formed between buffer C and 0.5 m NaCl in buffer C. YcjL was eluted when the concentration of NaCl was 0.15 m. MalE-YcjK was overexpressed after induction by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified from the cell-free extract by ammonium sulfate precipitation (30–50%) and an amylose column (New England Biolabs) chromatography according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. N-terminal Amino Acid Sequence—The N-terminal amino acid sequence of YcjL was determined by Edman degradation as described previously (21Suzuki H. Kumagai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43536-43543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry and Mass Spectrometry— Purified γ-Glu-Put and γ-Glu-GABA was dissolved in D2O and then analyzed with a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer. The mass of the purified γ-Glu-Put was measured by fast atom bombardment (FAB+)-mass spectrometry (model JEOLJMS600; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) using glycerol as a matrix. Purified γ-Glu-Put was fragmented by using N2 as a collision gas (at 5 millitorrs) at a collision energy (RO2 to RO1) of 10–11.5 eV, and then the masses of fragments were measured by ion spray mass spectrometry (model API-3000; PE Sciex). Synthesis and Purification of γ-Glu-Put and γ-Glu-GABA—γ-Glu-Put was originally purified by cation exchange chromatography using Dowex 50W-X8 (Dow Chemical) from the cell-free extract of SK247. After the structure was identified by NMR, MS, and MS/MS spectroscopic analysis, γ-Glu-Put was enzymatically synthesized from putrescine and glutamate using MalE-YcjK and purified by Dowex 50W-X8. The purity was authenticated by HPLC. γ-Glu-GABA was purified by anion exchange chromatography using Dowex 1-X8 (Dow Chemical) from the cell-free extract of SK279. The structure was identified by NMR. The purity was checked by HPLC. Transport Assay—The transport assay was performed as described previously (22Koyanagi T. Katayama T. Suzuki H. Kumagai H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Katayama T. Suzuki H. Koyanagi T. Kumagai H. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3135-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) using [14C]putrescine dihydrochloride, except that M9-tryptone medium was used instead of M63 medium. A Novel γ-GpNA Hydrolysis Activity of GGT-deficient Strain of E. coli—γ-GpNA is an artificial substrate widely used to measure GGT activity (24Orlowski M.M. Meister A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 73: 679-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found a novel γ-GpNA hydrolysis activity in the cytosol of E. coli strain SH639 (Δggt-2) grown at high aeration (60 ml of culture in a 300-ml Erlenmeyer flask shaken at 140 rpm). To identify the protein responsible for this activity, the relevant protein was purified, and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined by the Edman degradation method. The amino acid sequence obtained, MEN-IMNNPVIG, was compared with sequences in a data base, Colibri (genolist.pasteur.fr/Colibri/), and the relevant gene was found to be ycjL whose function was not known. Strain SK111 (ΔycjLC) completely lost the γ-GpNA hydrolysis activity, and SK112 (pBR-ycjL/SK111) overproduced the protein responsible for the activity. Purified YcjL hydrolyzed glutamine to glutamate and theanine (γ-glutamylethylamide) to glutamate and ethylamine. These results suggested that YcjL is a novel enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the γ-glutamyl linkage. Hypothesis for Physiological Roles of ycjL and Genes Around ycjL—It was not easy to determine the physiological role of YcjL because the ΔycjL mutant could grow on M9-glucose minimal medium as well as the wild-type strain. Several genes seem to function with ycjL in E. coli cells (Fig. 1). ycjC is located downstream of ycjL, and these two genes are suggested to compose an operon. YcjC has a helix-turn-helix motif, and the γ-GpNA hydrolysis activity of strain SK112 (pBR-ycjL/ΔycjLC) was 400 times that of SK121 (pBR-ycjLC/ΔycjLC). The results indicate that YcjC is a repressor of ycjL. ycjK is located upstream of ycjL in a reverse orientation, and its transcription is suggested to overlap with that of ycjL (Fig. 1). The disposition of these three genes, ycjK, ycjL, and ycjC, suggested that they functioned together. To presume the function of the products of this gene cluster, a homologous gene cluster for ycjKLC was searched for in the data base GenomeNet (www.genome.ad.jp/), and several were found in bacteria. The function of most of them was not known, but the function of one of them, the ipuABCDEFGH operon in Pseudomonas sp., has been reported (25van der de Azevedo W.S.I. Ploeg J.R. Maire T. Lebreton A. Kiener A. Leisinger T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2368-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). According to the report, the operon functions in isopropylamine (IPA) degradation. YcjK and IpuC showed 29.5% identity at the protein level, and both had homology with glutamine synthetase. YcjJ, which is located at downstream of ycjK (Fig. 1), showed 19.5% identity with IpuG, which is thought to be an IPA transporter. Furthermore, IpuF had hydrolysis activity for the γ-glutamyl linkage similar to YcjL. In the degradation pathway encoded by the ipu operon, IPA is taken up by IpuG and γ-glutamylated by IpuC in Pseudomonas sp. cells. Subsequently, γ-glutamyl-IPA is oxidized by IpuD, and the product, γ-glutamyl-alaninol, is hydrolyzed by IpuF to glutamate and alaninol (Fig. 2A). Here we hypothesized that some amine is first imported into the E. coli cell by YcjJ, and its amino group is γ-glutamylated by YcjK. Subsequently, the amine part of γ-glutamyl-amine is oxidized by some oxidoreductase. Finally, the γ-glutamyl linkage of γ-glutamyl-oxidized amine is hydrolyzed to glutamate and oxidized amine by YcjL. The oxidized amine can probably be converted to the next catabolite more easily than the original amine. In this hypothesis, the oxidoreductase is important to make sense of the γ-glutamylation, and we searched for it near ycjJKLC. Downstream of the ycjLC operon, we found ordL predicted to encode oxidoreductase. ordL is a member of the aldH-ordL-goaG operon. This operon had already been reported, but its mRNA could not be detected by Northern analysis (26Jovanovic G. Model P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3095-3102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the gene products of ycjJ, ycjK, the ycjLC operon, and the aldH-ordL-goaG operon (ycj gene cluster) work together in the uptake and degradation of some amine. Therefore, it was essential to identify this amine to elucidate the physiological role of the ycj gene cluster.Fig. 2A, postulated pathway for the degradation of isopropylamine by Pseudomonas sp.

In the cell-free extract of this strain, we found a much accumulated compound. This compound was eluted at 28 min in our HPLC system. It was purified and subjected to NMR, MS, and MS/MS spectroscopic analysis. The chemical structure estimated by NMR was γ-Glu-Put. The mass of the molecular ion (m/z 218) and the fragmentation pattern of the compound by MS/MS indicate its structure to be γ-Glu-Put. To confirm that YcjK catalyzes the reaction of γ-Glu-Put synthesis in vivo, SO61 (pmal-c2X-ycjK/ΔycjKLC Δ(aldH-ordL-goaG); ycjJ+ ycjK+ ycjL– ycjC– aldH– ordL– goaG–) and SO60 (pmal-c2X/ΔycjKLC Δ(aldH-ordL-goaG); ycjJ+ ycjK– ycjL– ycjC– aldH– ordL– goaG–) were grown in M9-tryptone, and the cell-free extract was subjected to HPLC. The strain with the plasmid encoding MalE-YcjK exhibited γ-Glu-Put accumulation, whereas the strain with the empty vector did not. To show γ-Glu-Put synthesis by YcjK in vitro, MalE-YcjK was purified and mixed with putrescine, glutamate, ATP, and Mg2+, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C. The synthesis of γ-Glu-Put was confirmed by HPLC and was not observed without ATP and Mg2+. These results strongly indicated that YcjK is γ-Glu-Put synthetase, and the products of the ycj gene cluster catabolize putrescine. Putrescine is reported to be degraded after acetylation in mammalian cells (27Seiler N. Al-Therib M.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 144: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Referring to that report (27Seiler N. Al-Therib M.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 144: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that putrescine is degraded in E. coli after γ-glutamylation instead of acetylation in mammalian cells. The entire novel putrescine utilization pathway of E. coli proposed here is summarized in Fig. 2B. OrdL Is γ-Glu-put Oxidase and AldH Is γ-Glu-γ-aminobutyraldehyde Dehydrogenase—After the YcjK reaction, γ-Glu-Put was expected to be oxidized to γ-Glu-γ-aminobutyraldehyde by OrdL and then to γ-Glu-γ-aminobutyrate (γ-Glu-GABA) by AldH (Fig. 2B). To show these reactions in vivo, four strains, SK263 (pACYC184/ΔycjLC Δ(aldH-ordL-goaG); ycjJ+ ycjK+ ycjL– ycjC– aldH– ordL– goaG–), SK285 (pACYC-aldH/ΔycjLC Δ(aldH-ordL-goaG); ycjJ+ ycjK+ aldH+ ycjL– ycjC– ordL– goaG–), SK283 (pACYC-ordL/ΔycjLC Δ(aldH-ordL-goaG); ycjJ+ ycjK+ ordL+ ycjL– ycjC– aldH– goaG–), and SK279 (pACYC-aldH-ordL/ΔycjLC Δ(aldH-ordL-goaG); ycjJ+ ycjK+ aldH+ ordL+ ycjL– ycjC– goaG–) were constructed. Cell-free extracts of these strains were obtained and analyzed by HPLC. SK263 (ycjJ+ ycjK+) exceedingly accumulated γ-Glu-Put (Fig. 3A). The addition of aldH+ to this strain did not influence the chromatogram (SK285) (Fig. 3B), whereas the addition of ordL+ to SK263 diminished the peak of γ-Glu-Put (SK283) (Fig. 3C). When both ordL+ and aldH+ were added to SK263, a new compound that eluted at 7.5 min in our HPLC system was accumulated (SK279) (Fig. 3D). This compound was purified and subjected to NMR analysis. The results indicated that the new compound is γ-Glu-GABA. The compound was also hydrolyzed to GABA and glutamate by GGT which is well known to hydrolyze the γ-glutamyl linkage. γ-Glu-Put decreased with the addition of the cell-free extract of SO66 (pQE-80L-ordL/SK247) but not with that of SO67 (pQE-80L/SK247). These results suggested that γ-Glu-Put is catabolized to γ-Glu-GABA by the sequential reactions involving OrdL and AldH. YcjL Is γ-Glu-GABA Hydrolase—To elucidate the physiological role of YcjL in vivo, two strains were constructed, SK189 (Δ(ordL-goaG)) and SK187 (ΔgoaG). OrdL is located upstream, and GoaG downstream, of YcjL in the hypothetical catabolic pathway (see Fig. 2B). The cell-free extract of SK189 (Δ(ordL-goaG)) exhibited only 23% γ-GpNA hydrolysis activity compared with SK187 (ΔgoaG) which exhibited the same level of activity as the wild-type strain. This result can be interpreted to mean that the metabolite upstream of YcjL, γ-glutamyl-γ-aminobutyraldehyde, and/or γ-Glu-GABA could induce ycjL expression and that the deletion of goaG, the product of which is located downstream of YcjL in the metabolic pathway, did not influence ycjL expression. YcjK catalyzes the γ-glutamylation of putrescine to form the γ-glutamyl linkage of γ-Glu-Put, whereas YcjL catalyzes the hydrolysis of the γ-glutamyl linkage of γ-Glu-GABA. If γ-Glu-Put is a better substrate for YcjL than γ-Glu-GABA, there is no good reason for the γ-glutamylate putrescine consuming ATP. To determine which is the better substrate, Km and kcat values of YcjL for γ-Glu-Put and γ-Glu-GABA were determined. The Km for γ-Glu-Put was 18.5 mm and that for γ-Glu-GABA was 2.93 mm. The kcat for γ-Glu-Put was 434 min–1 and that for γ-Glu-GABA was 2490 min–1. The kcat/Km for γ-Glu-Put was 23.5 and that for γ-Glu-GABA was 850, i.e. the kcat/Km for γ-Glu-GABA was 36 times higher than that for γ-Glu-Put. The results showed that γ-Glu-GABA rather than γ-Glu-Put is the natural substrate of YcjL. The YcjL activity measured as γ-GpNA hydrolysis activity was 16 times higher when E. coli was grown in the W-Put medium rather than in the W salts minimal medium containing 0.2% NH4Cl instead of putrescine. These results indicated that YcjL is γ-Glu-GABA hydrolase. GoaG Is the Second GABA Aminotransferase—Previously, putrescine was reported to be oxidized directly to GABA (8Shaibe E. Metzer E. Halpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 933-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and be degraded to succinate by GabT and GabD (9Metzer E. Levitz R. Halpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported in another study on the gabDTPC operon that encodes the GABA degradation pathway in E. coli that the strain ΔgabT did not grow in W salts minimal medium containing 0.2% GABA as a sole nitrogen source, whereas this strain grew in W-Put medium (10Schneider B.L. Ruback S. Kiupakis A.K. Kasbarian H. Pybus C. Reitzer L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6976-6986Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cell-free extract of ΔgabT grown in W-Put medium exhibited significant GABA aminotransferase activity. These results suggested that besides GabT, there is another GABA aminotransferase that is induced by putrescine. We suspected that this second aminotransferase was encoded by goaG in the ycj gene cluster. The cell-free extract of KJ107 (ΔgabT), SK187 (ΔgoaG), and KJ109 (ΔgabT ΔgoaG) grown in M9-tryptone supplemented with 5 mm putrescine exhibited 68, 35, and 1.3% GABA aminotransferase activity, respectively, compared with SH639 (gabT+ goaG+). These results indicate that both GabT and GoaG are important in the catabolism of GABA. In the cell-free extracts of the ΔgoaG strain, accumulation of GABA was observed. These results agreed well with the putrescine-catabolizing pathway postulated in Fig. 2B. YcjJ Is a Novel Putrescine Importer—Downstream of ycjK, there is a gene, ycjJ, whose product is suggested to be an amine transporter from its amino acid sequence. From the results described so far, the substrate of YcjJ is expected to be putrescine. To show that putrescine is imported by YcjJ, a transporter assay using [14C] putrescine was performed. The putrescine transport activity of SO23 (ΔycjJ) was reduced compared with that of SH639 (ycjJ+), whereas SO24 (pBR-ycjJ/SO23) imported putrescine over 24 times more effectively than SH639 (ycjJ+) (Fig. 4). The result indicated that YcjJ is a novel putrescine importer. In SO23 (ΔycjJ), putrescine import activity was very much diminished, although the strain is potF+G+H+I+ (12Pistocchi R. Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Sadakata Y. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 146-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The result indicates that under our growth conditions for E. coli, the putrescine importer mainly expressed is YcjJ. A more detailed analysis of YcjJ will be published elsewhere. Disruption and Complementation of ycj Gene Cluster Influence the Utilization of Putrescine in E. coli—To show that the products of the ycj gene cluster play an important role in the catabolism of putrescine, various parts of the ycj gene cluster were disrupted or complemented, and the mutants and transformants were grown on W-Put medium. Whereas SO23 (ΔycjJ) and SO25 (pBR322/SO23) were not able to grow on the W-Put plates, SH639 (ycjJ+) and SO24 (pBR-ycjJ/SO23) were (Fig. 5A). These results suggested that YcjJ is the main putrescine importer when E. coli grows on medium containing putrescine as a sole nitrogen source. Whereas SK247 (Δ(ycjLC-aldH-ordL-goaG)) and SK306 (pBeloBAC11/SK247) could not grow on the W-Put plates, SH639 (ycjL+C+ aldH+ ordL+ goaG+) and SK303 (pBelo-ycjLC-aldH-ordL-goaG/SK247) could (Fig. 5B). These results suggested that the catabolic pathway shown in Fig. 2B is the main one when E. coli grows in the medium containing putrescine as the sole source of nitrogen. KJ109 (ΔgabT ΔgoaG) did not grow on W-Put plates, whereas KJ107 (ΔgabT), SK187 (ΔgoaG), and SH639 (goaG+ gabT+) did (Fig. 5C). The result suggested that both GoaG and GabT are important in the catabolism of GABA. The two enzymes can substitute for each other in the catabolic pathway. This is consistent with the results from the assay of the GABA aminotransferase activity of SK187 (ΔgoaG), KJ107 (ΔgabT), and KJ109 (ΔgoaG ΔgabT). The Significance of γ-Glutamylation of Putrescine—In the novel pathway we proposed, putrescine is first γ-glutamylated and then catabolized (Fig. 2B), but previously, putrescine had been thought to be degraded directly to γ-aminobutyraldehyde without any modification and then to GABA (8Shaibe E. Metzer E. Halpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 933-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, γ-aminobutyraldehyde is unstable, and its amino group and aldehyde group form cyclic Δ1-pyrroline nonenzymatically (8Shaibe E. Metzer E. Halpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 933-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). γ-Glutamylation of putrescine may facilitate its catabolism by masking the amino group in advance and by preventing cyclization. Regulation of the ycj Gene Cluster—Nac is a σ70-dependent transcriptional regulator under nitrogen-limited conditions (28Muse W.B. Bender R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the members of the ycj gene cluster are expected to be transcribed from σ70-dependent promoters, and many results obtained so far were under nitrogen-limited conditions. Therefore, Nac was expected to control the expression of the ycj gene cluster; however, there is no Nac-binding site upstream of any of these genes. Furthermore, in a previous study using microarrays (29Zimmer D.P. Soupene E. Lee H.L. Wendisch V.F. Khodursky A.B. Peter B.J. Bender R.A. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14674-14679Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), no member of the ycj gene cluster was recognized as a Nac-controlled gene. However, the addition of putrescine to the medium as the sole nitrogen source (W-put medium) induced the expression of ycjL (data not shown). This result suggested that a new system or protein (for example, YcjC) involved in the response to the nitrogen starvation controls the expression of the ycj gene cluster. The addition of glucose to the M9-tryptone medium repressed the expression of ycjL (data not shown). However, there is no CRP-binding site upstream of any of these genes. Furthermore, the expression of ycjL was also repressed by the addition of glycerol and succinate to the M9-tryptone medium. These results suggested that the regulation of the expression of ycjL is independent of CRP. YcjL was highly expressed in the early stationary phase (data not shown) when the nutrient in the medium is drying up. These results suggested that the products of the ycj gene cluster are expressed when E. coli grows under conditions of starvation, and the products of the ycj gene cluster catabolize putrescine both as the carbon source and as the nitrogen source. We could not perform the experiment to detect the growth of E. coli on medium containing putrescine as a sole carbon source because wild-type E. coli could not grow on that medium. In summary, the expression of ycjL (and maybe the other members of the ycj gene cluster) is repressed in the presence of ycjC and by the addition of another carbon or nitrogen source more easily utilized than putrescine, and is induced by nutrient starvation and by the addition of putrescine to the medium. A more detailed analysis of the regulation of the ycj gene cluster will be published elsewhere. Proposed New Gene Name for the ycj Gene Cluster—We propose the name puu after putrescine utilization pathway for the ycj gene cluster. ycjJ, ycjK, ordL, aldH, ycjL, goaG, and ycjC would be renamed puuP, puuA, puuB, puuC, puuD, puuE, and puuR, respectively (Table II).Table IIThe function of ycj gene cluster and their new gene names proposedPrevious gene namesFunctionNew gene namesycjJPutrescine importerpuuPycjKγ-Glu-Put synthetasepuuAordLγ-Glu-Put oxidasepuuBaldHγ-Glu-γ-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenasepuuCycjLγ-Glu-GABA hydrolasepuuDgoaGGABA aminotransferasepuuEycjCTranscriptional regulatorpuuR Open table in a new tab We thank Dr. Michihiko Kataoka and Dr. Sakayu Shimizu, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, for protein sequencing of PuuD.

CaMKII plays a critical role in regulating various signaling pathways leading to modulation of several aspects of cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, cytoskeletal structure, and gene expression. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression of CaMKII in osteoblast-like cells (MC4) and to elucidate its role in osteoblast differentiation. We demonstrated that CaMKII, specifically the α isoform, is expressed in osteoblasts both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of CaMKII by the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine or the CaMKII antagonist KN93 reduces alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization, as well as causes 85 and 56% decreases in alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin gene expression, respectively. CaM and CaMKII antagonists, using the newborn mouse calvaria in vivo model, cause a 50% decrease in osteoblast number (N.Ob-BS) and a 32% decrease in mineralization (BV/TV). Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of α-CaMKII by using trifluoperazine, KN93, and α-CaMKII small interfering RNA decreases the phosphorylation of ERK and of cAMP-response element-binding protein, leading to a significant decrease in the transactivation of serum response element and cAMP-response element. Inhibition of α-CaMKII decreases the expression of c-fos, AP-1 transactivation, and AP-1 DNA binding activity. Our findings demonstrated that α-CaMKII is expressed in osteoblasts and is involved in c-fos expression via regulation of serum response element and cAMP-response element. Inhibition of α-CaMKII results in a decrease in c-fos expression and AP-1 activation, leading to inhibition of osteoblast differentiation.

Cellular responses to several hormones, cytokines, mechanical stimuli, and many other signaling molecules involve the activation of the Ca2+/calmodulin pathway in numerous cell types, including osteoblasts (1Bergh J.J.

It has also been shown from transgenic mice models that the elevation of CaM expression leads to an increase in the autonomous activity of CaMKII (3Colomer J.M. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The ubiquitously expressed CaMKII is involved in several aspects of cellular function (4Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). There are now over 30 identified isoforms of CaMKII, with molecular masses ranging from 52 to 83 kDa, resulting from alternative messenger RNA splicing of four genes (α, β, γ, and δ) (5Fink C.C. Meyer T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The CaMKII isoforms α and β are highly homologous, with the exception of an ∼30-amino acid sequence in the β isoform that serves as an actin-targeting domain (5Fink C.C. Meyer T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These two isoforms were once thought to be expressed only in the brain (6Erondu N.E. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 3270-3277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is becoming increasingly evident that the α isoform is expressed in other cells such as thyroid, hepatic, and smooth muscle cells (7Illario M.

In contrast, the γ and δ isoforms are known to be expressed in various extraneural cells but predominantly in embryonic cells and lymphocytes, respectively (9Caran N. Johnson L.D. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42514-42519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All CaMKII isoforms are capable of homo- and hetero-multimerization via their C-terminal domain to form 300–700-kDa holoenzymes, with the subunit composition being dictated in a stochastic manner by relative isoform expression levels (10Colbran R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 11Hudmon A. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 473-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 12Hudmon A. Schulman H. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 593-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, the activation of CaMKII ultimately promotes its autophosphorylation on threonine 286. This process increases the affinity of CaMKII for Ca2+/CaM by ∼1000-fold and helps maintain the enzyme in a partially activated or autonomous state even after dissociation of CaM (13Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated CaMKII then modulates the activity of several transcription factors, including CREB (14Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar), ATF (15Shimomura A. Ogawa Y. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. Hagiwara M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25483-25493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ultimately, the activation of CaMKII and its downstream signaling cascade is involved in regulating a wide variety of cellular events, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (4Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts originate from mesenchymal progenitors that, with the appropriate stimulation, undergo proliferation and differentiate into preosteoblasts and then into mature, functional osteoblasts (18Aubin J.E. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1998; 30 –31: 73-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In culture, as in vivo, osteoblasts form bone-like mineralized nodules by undergoing three stages of development: proliferation, extracellular matrix maturation, and mineralization (19Quarles L.D. Yohay D.A. Lever L.W. Caton R. Wenstrup R.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 20Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M. Wilming L. Tassinari M.S. Kennedy M.B. Pockwinse S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). During each stage of development, specific subsets of genes are sequentially expressed or repressed. For example, collagen I is known to be a marker for proliferation, alkaline phosphatase for the extracellular matrix maturation, and osteocalcin for mineralization (20Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M. Wilming L. Tassinari M.S. Kennedy M.B. Pockwinse S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). The regulation of gene expression in osteoblasts during development and differentiation occurs predominantly at the transcriptional level. Several transcription factors, such as AP-1, CREB/ATF2, and Runx2 have been shown to play a major role in the regulation of osteoblast gene expression, phenotype, and ultimately bone formation (21Zayzafoon M. Stell C. Irwin R. McCabe L.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Zayzafoon M. Botolin S. McCabe L.R. J. Biol.

AP-1 is a dimeric transcription factor composed of either homodimers of the Jun family (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) or heterodimers of the Jun and Fos family (c-Fos, Fra-1, Fra-2, and FosB) (24Angel P.

Dimerization of AP-1 family members is a prerequisite for DNA binding to their G-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) response element (TRE) and CRE consensus elements (25Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar, 26Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 533-542PubMed Google Scholar). The role of AP-1 in skeletal development has been elucidated mainly by genetic studies in mice (27Eferl R. Wagner E.F. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar, 28Jochum W. David J.P. Elliott C. Wutz A. Plenk Jr., H. Matsuo K. Wagner E.F. Nat.

The importance of the Fos family in bone formation has been demonstrated by the c-Fos knock-out model that leads to a complete inhibition of osteoclast formation, the development of osteopetrosis (30Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar), and a decrease in osteoblast differentiation (31Demiralp B. Chen H.L. Koh A.J. Keller E.T. McCauley L.K. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4038-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, the overexpression of c-Fos leads to osteosarcoma caused by osteoblast transformation (32Grigoriadis A.E. Schellander K. Wang Z.Q. Wagner E.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The overexpression of Fra-1 or ΔFosB leads to osteosclerosis caused by an increase in osteoblastogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (28Jochum W. David J.P. Elliott C. Wutz A. Plenk Jr., H. Matsuo K. Wagner E.F. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 33Sabatakos G. Sims N.A. Chen J. Aoki K. Kelz M.B. Amling M. Bouali Y. Mukhopadhyay K. Ford K. Nestler E.J. Baron R. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). CREB/ATF is another family of transcription factors that plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation. It has been reported that during osteoblast differentiation there is an increase in the phosphorylation and activation of CREB. In addition, during mineralization, most of the CREB bound to the CRE consensus sequence has been shown to be phosphorylated. Furthermore, the increase in CRE activity in osteoblasts has been reported to alter the composition of AP-1 family members and ultimately to decrease osteoblast differentiation (22Zayzafoon M. Botolin S. McCabe L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37212-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The c-fos promoter has been shown to be regulated by two important response elements, the SRE and CRE, located within the 400-bp region directly upstream of the transcriptional start site. The activation of several upstream kinases, such as ERK and CREB, can ultimately lead to increasing the transactivation of SRE and CRE, respectively (34Kukushkin A.N. Abramova M.V. Svetlikova S.B. Darieva Z.A. Pospelova T.V. Pospelov V.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 35Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CaMKII has been shown to regulate the activation of both ERK and CREB (8Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R.

Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6107-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The aims of this study were to examine the expression of CaMKII isoforms, specifically the α isoform in osteoblasts, and to elucidate the role of this kinase in osteoblast differentiation. Here we have demonstrated that the α and γ CaMKII isoforms are expressed in osteoblasts and that α-CaMKII regulates CRE and SRE transactivation and c-fos expression. We have also shown that pharmacologic and specific genetic inhibition of α-CaMKII inhibits the activity of the CRE and SRE response elements, leading to a decrease in AP-1 transactivation and DNA binding activity. Ultimately, this leads to a decrease in osteoblast differentiation, both in vitro and in vivo. Cell Culture and Differentiation—The murine osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, Subclone 4 (MC4) (37Wang D. Christensen K. Chawla K. Xiao G. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells have been shown to possess high osteoblastic potential (37Wang D. Christensen K. Chawla K. Xiao G. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in minimum essential Eagle's medium, α modification (α-MEM) (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 2–3 days and were not used beyond passage 25. Osteoblastic induction was performed by supplementing the maintenance medium with 5 mm β-glycerophosphate and 50 μm ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (22Zayzafoon M. Botolin S. McCabe L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37212-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Animal Studies—Balb/c mice, 5 days old, were injected daily in the calvarial region with 75 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing either Me2SO (control) or 10 μm calmodulin antagonist (TFP or KN93) as described previously (22Zayzafoon M. Botolin S. McCabe L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37212-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, a needle (26 gauge) was inserted at the base of the calvaria and pushed until it reached the central region of the skull. Solution was then injected subcutaneously over the parietal region of the skull. After 7 days, mice were sacrificed, and calvariae were harvested. Tissues were washed with PBS, fixed with 10% formalin, and embedded in methyl methacrylate. Undemineralized sections (5-μm thick) were cut and stained with Goldner's Trichrome and von Kossa stains. A region of interest was selected and remained constant for all animals regardless of the shape of the section. Standard bone histomorphometry as described by Parfitt et al. (38Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4921) Google Scholar) was performed using the BioQuant image analysis software (R & M Biometrics, Nashville, TN) in the Histomorphometry and Molecular Analysis Core Laboratory of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Bone Center. In addition, the brains of some of the animals were collected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted, and RT-PCR was performed as described below and used as a positive control for the confirmation of the expression of CaMKII isoforms. All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted by the TRIzol method as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). One μg of RNA was reversed-transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase, and the equivalent of 10 ng was used for TaqMan real-time quantitative RT-PCRs as described previously (23Zayzafoon M. Gathings W.E. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The expression of 18 S rRNA was used as a control. The sequences and conditions for the specific primers used in this study were as described previously: ALP (23Zayzafoon M. Gathings W.E. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), osteocalcin (23Zayzafoon M. Gathings W.E. McDonald J.M.

Res. 1999; 84: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Regular PCR was performed using recombinant TaqDNA polymerase and a Bio-Rad i-Cycler (Hercules, CA). Amplified products were then electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel. Digital images were taken and analyzed using the Kodak Digital Science one-dimensional image analysis software (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Whole Cell Protein Extraction—At the end of the study, MC4 cells were washed with chilled PBS, centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol). Protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added to the lysis buffer (41Zayzafoon M. Abdulkadir S.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3662-3670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (41Zayzafoon M. Abdulkadir S.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3662-3670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were loaded (30 μg/lane) onto a mini-SDS-PAGE system. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Immobilon-P (Millipore Co.), using a Bio-Rad wet transfer system. Protein transfer efficiency and size determination were verified using prestained protein markers. Membranes were then blocked with Tris-buffered saline-Blotto B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated overnight with antibodies directed against α-CaMKII, ERK, CREB, phosphorylated ERK, phosphorylated CREB (Ser-133), and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Signals were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) (23Zayzafoon M. Gathings W.E. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Alkaline Phosphatase Staining—Cells were washed with cold PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, and stored at 4 °C in 100 mm cacodylic acid buffer (pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with freshly prepared alkaline phosphatase substrate solution (100 mm Tris-maleate buffer (pH 8.4), 2.8% N,N-dimethyl formamide (v/v), 1 mg/ml Fast Red TR, and 0.5 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX phosphate). The reaction was terminated after 30 min by removal of the substrate solution and washing with 100 mm cacodylic acid buffer. Mineral Deposition—Mineralization was assessed by either von Kossa staining of the cultures (5 min in 3% AgNO3) (42Clark G. Clark G. Stain Procedures. 4th Ed. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1981: 187Google Scholar) or by calcium measurement in the culture as described previously (41Zayzafoon M. Abdulkadir S.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3662-3670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected by scraping into 10 mm Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 0.2% Triton X-100. An aliquot was removed for determination of protein concentration, and the remaining material was incubated in 0.5 m HCl (final concentration) at 70 °C for 15 min, followed by spectrophotometric calcium detection (Arsenazo III; Sigma). Nuclear Protein Extraction—MC4 cells were washed with chilled PBS and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were then isolated by detergent lysis of the cells with an Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.56 m sucrose. Nuclei were then treated with a hypotonic solution containing 10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm KCl followed by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C in an extraction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, 600 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA. Nuclei were finally centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. All solutions in this procedure contained a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (41Zayzafoon M. Abdulkadir S.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3662-3670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The AP-1 oligonucleotide was labeled as described previously (41Zayzafoon M. Abdulkadir S.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3662-3670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide sequence used as a probe was as follows: 5′-GCGTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ (43Sunters A. Thomas D.P. Yeudall W.A. Grigoriadis A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9882-9891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Four μg of nuclear extracts were then incubated for 20 min at room temperature with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the AP-1 consensus sequence in a loading buffer, pH 7.5 (50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). DNA-protein complexes were resolved by 5% native PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C with an intensifying screen. Immunofluorescence—MC4 osteoblasts were cultured on coverslips for 24 h. Cells were then washed with cold PBS and fixed in methanol. Tibias were collected from 5–6-week-old mice, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, decalcified in 0.25 m EDTA, and 5-μm bone sections were obtained. Samples were then blocked for 1 h in Fc receptor blocker (Innovex Biosciences, Richmond, CA). α-CaMKII antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted in Fc blocker solution and applied to the samples for overnight incubation at 4 °C. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was then used for 30 min. A nonspecific IgG was used for negative controls. At least 10 randomly selected microscopic fields were examined using ×10 and ×40 objectives. Photos were taken with a SPOT digital camera (41Zayzafoon M. Abdulkadir S.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3662-3670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Transient Transfections and Luciferase Reporter Assays—MC4 osteoblasts were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates. 24 h after plating, cells were transfected with 1 μg of luciferase reporter plasmids driven by the AP-1, CRE, SRE sequences (Clontech), CMV-CaMKII-green fluorescent protein (provided by Dr. Tobias Meyer), or a CMV-β-galactosidase reporter construct (as a control). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h post-transfection, the medium was changed and cells were treated with CaM or CaMKII inhibitors as indicated. Cells were lysed and reporter activity was measured using a luciferase (Promega) or β-galactosidase (Clontech) assay system and a luminometer (22Zayzafoon M. Botolin S. McCabe L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37212-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was evaluated by transfecting CMV-green fluorescent protein, and an efficiency of 70–80% was observed. Gene Silencing by siRNA—MC4 osteoblasts were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates. α-CaMKII siRNA (Dharmacon Research, Inc., Lafayette, CO.) or control non-functional siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was transfected into the cells using TransIT-TKO transfection reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Mirus, Madison, WI). The medium was changed 24 h post-transfection, and the cells were cultured with fresh medium. Cells were harvested 72 h later. The success of the siRNA transfection was confirmed by demonstrating the inhibition of CaMKII protein expression (Fig. 6). The α-CaMKII 1 siRNA sequence is as follows: 5′-CACCACCAUUGAGGACGAAdTdT-3′, 3′-dTdTGUGGUGGUAACUCCUGCUU-5′. Statistical Analysis—All statistical analyses were performed using the Microsoft Excel data analysis program for Student's t test analysis. Experiments were repeated at least three times unless otherwise stated. Values were expressed as a mean ± S.E. To characterize the expression of CaMKII in osteoblasts, MC4 cells were cultured for 10 days in the presence of β-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid, and the expression of CaMKII isoforms was examined. Differentiated osteoblasts expressed the genes for α and γ isoforms of CaMKII, as shown by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). Expression of the β isoform was not detectable in osteoblasts. Positive controls on RNA extracted from mouse brain show expression of all three isoforms (Fig. 1A). Protein expression of the α-CaMKII isoforms was seen in osteoblasts both in vitro and in vivo as demonstrated by Western blotting and immunofluorescence, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). To examine the phosphorylation states and localization of α-CaMKII in osteoblasts, immunofluorescence was performed using an antibody directed against phosphorylated α-CaMKII (Thr-286), which displays distinct speckled perinuclear localization (Fig. 1D). We also overexpressed α-CaMKII tagged with green fluorescent protein, generously provided by Dr. Tobias Meyer, Stanford University (44Shen K. Meyer T. Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), to monitor the localization of α-CaMKII in osteoblasts. Similar to immunofluorescence, overexpression of α-CaMKII-green fluorescent protein produced a distinct pattern of perinuclear localization (data not shown). The role of CaMKII during osteoblast differentiation was examined using the known CaM and CaMKII antagonists, TFP and KN93, respectively. MC4 cells were cultured, with or without 10 μm inhibitors, for 10 and 18 days in the presence of β-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid. At the end of the study, cells were fix"
https://openalex.org/W2053828364,"Vitamin B6 is an essential cofactor for more than 100 enzymatic reactions. Mammalian cells are unable to synthesize vitamin B6 de novo, whereas bacteria, plants, fungi, and as shown here Plasmodium falciparum possess a functional vitamin B6 synthesis pathway. P. falciparum expresses the proteins Pdx1 and Pdx2, corresponding to the yeast enzymes Snz1-p and Sno1-p, which are essential for the vitamin B6 biosynthesis. An involvement of PfPdx1 and PfPdx2 in the de novo synthesis of vitamin B6 was shown by complementation of pyridoxine auxotroph yeast cells. Both plasmodial proteins act together in the glutaminase activity with a specific activity of 209 nmol min–1 mg–1 and a Km value for glutamine of 1.3 mm. Incubation of the parasites with methylene blue revealed by Northern blot analysis an elevated transcriptional level of pdx1 and pdx2, suggesting a participation of these proteins in the defenses against singlet oxygen. To be an active cofactor, vitamin B6 has to be phosphorylated by the pyridoxine kinase (PdxK). The recombinant plasmodial PdxK revealed Km values for the B6 vitamers pyridoxine and pyridoxal and for ATP of 212, 70, and 82 μm, respectively. All three enzymes expose a stage-specific transcription pattern within the trophozoite stage that guarantees the concurrent expression of Pdx1, Pdx2, and PdxK for the indispensable provision of vitamin B6. The occurrence of the vitamin B6 de novo synthesis pathway displays a potential new drug target, which can be exploited for the development of new chemotherapeutics against the human malaria parasite P. falciparum.

Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) 1The abbreviations used are: PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; PdxK, pyridoxal kinase; PfPdxK, plasmodial pyridoxal kinase; PN, pyridoxine; DON, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine; APAD, acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide.1The abbreviations used are: PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; PdxK, pyridoxal kinase; PfPdxK, plasmodial pyridoxal kinase; PN, pyridoxine; DON, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine; APAD, acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide. is the active cofactor of more than 100 vitamin B6-dependent enzymes and essential for their catalytic reactions such as amino acid decarboxylation, elimination, and amino transfer (1Percudani R. Peracchi A. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). PLP is produced from its precursor pyridoxine and the B6 vitamers pyridoxal and pyridoxamine. Whereas almost all bacteria, fungi, and plants possess their own vitamin B6 biosynthesis, mammals do not synthesize pyridoxine and entirely depend on the uptake of this indispensable nutrient from their diet. Two different pathways are currently known to synthesis pyridoxine de novo: the Escherichia coli-like pathway and the fungi-like pathway. In E. coli the biosynthetic pathway of vitamin B6, consisting of the pdx family (Pdx A, B, C, F, H, J, and GapA), has been the subject of various studies and is therefore well understood (2Roa B.B. Connolly D.M. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4767-4777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lam H.M. Tancula E. Dempsey W.B. Winkler M.E. J.

It is known that in E. coli two different branches have to be amalgamated by the enzymes PdxA and PdxJ for the de novo synthesis of pyridoxine 5′-phosphate (PNP) (6Yang Y. Zhao G. Man T.K. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4294-4299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate of one branch is d-erythrose-4-phosphate, while 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) was found to be the precursor of the other branch (3Lam H.M. Tancula E. Dempsey W.B. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1554-1567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yang Y. Zhao G. Man T.K. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4294-4299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently a distinctly different synthesis pathway has been identified in the fungi Cercospora nicotianae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and in some bacteria like Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Bacillus subtilis (7Ehrenshaft M. Jenns A.E. Chung K.R. Daub M.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Originally this pathway was assigned to be involved in detoxification of singlet oxygen (1O2) (7Ehrenshaft M. Jenns A.E. Chung K.R. Daub M.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the analysis of fungi mutants, deficient in SOR1 (singlet oxygen resistance) and therefore sensitive for singlet oxygen, demonstrated that the product of this gene was also participating in pyridoxine biosynthesis (8Ehrenshaft M.

In C. nicotianae the Sor1-p or Pdx1-p enzyme (also named as Snz1-p in S. cerevisiae or YaaD in B. subtilis) corresponds to the highly conserved enzyme family Snz in yeast. In S. cerevisiae another protein, Sno1-p (Pdx2-p in C. nicotianae or YaaE in B. subtilis), is a member of the preserved Sno-p protein family. The Sno1-p protein is coregulated during growth and nutrient limitation with Snz1-p and interacts with Snz1-p as was shown by the yeast two-hybrid system (10Padilla P.A. Fuge E.K. Crawford M.E. Errett A. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An involvement of Pdx2-p in vitamin B6de novo synthesis was confirmed by complementation of mutants deficient in pyridoxine biosynthesis (11Ehrenshaft M. Daub M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3383-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Neither the precise enzymatic reaction, catalyzed by Pdx1-p and Pdx2-p (Snz1-p and Sno1-p in yeast), nor its substrates are known. However, Pdx2-p possesses glutamine amidotransferase activity (11Ehrenshaft M. Daub M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3383-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Dong Y.X. Sueda S. Nikawa J. Kondo H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To become the active cofactor, vitamin B6 has to be phosphorylated by the pyridoxine/pyridoxal kinase (PdxK), a reaction that occurs in all organisms known so far. Pyridoxine kinases are members of the ribokinase superfamily (13Mathews I.I. Erion M.D. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15607-15620Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 14Sigrell J.A.

They have been characterized in several organisms such as Homo sapiens, A. thaliana, B. subtilis, and the parasite Trypanosoma brucei (17Kerry J.A. Rohde M. Kwok F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Scott T.C. Phillips M.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Lum H.K. Kwok F.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Malaria is one of the most serious infectious diseases in the world (WHO, Communicable Disease Report). In the most deadly agent, Plasmodium falciparum, anti-malarial drugs are losing efficacy due to drug resistance. For this reason there is an urgent necessity to identify novel targets within the parasite's metabolism for the development of new chemotherapeutics (21Newton P. White N. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Very recently, Cassera et al. (22Cassera M.B. Gozzo F.C. D'Alexandri F.L. Merino E.F. Del Portillo H.A. Peres V.J. Almeida I.C. Eberlin M.N. Wunderlich G. Wiesner J. Jomaa H. Kimura E.A. Katzin A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51749-51759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) provided evidence by metabolic labeling experiments for an active de novo biosynthesis of pyridoxine in P. falciparum. Here we report the identification of genes encoding proteins that are similar to the vitamin B6 de novo synthesis enzymes Snz1-p and Sno1-p in yeast. Additionally, an open reading frame was identified within the plasmodial genome data base referring to a pyridoxine kinase that is responsible for the activation of vitamin B6. Biochemical analysis of these plasmodial proteins substantiates the presence of a functional vitamin B6 biosynthesis pathway that can be exploited as a potential new drug target in the human malaria parasite P. falciparum. Materials—Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotides were from Qiagen. The cloning vectors pASK-IBA7 and pASK-IBA3, Strep-Tactin-Sepharose, anhydrotetracycline, and desthiobiotine were from IBA (Institut für Bioanalytik). [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci mmol–1) was from Amersham Biosciences. Glutamate dehydrogenase, acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (APAD), and NADP+, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON), pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine were from Sigma. Cloning of the Pdx1, Pdx2, and PdxK—The open reading frame encoding for Pdx1 was amplified by PCR using P. falciparum 3D7 genomic DNA and the sense and antisense oligonucleotides PfPdx1-IBA3-S (5′-GCGCGCGGTCTCGAATGGAAAATCATAAAGATGATGC-3′), PfPdx1-IBA3-AS (5′-GCGCGCGGTCTCAGCGCTTTGTGGTGTTAAAAATTTGGTGTG-3′). The open reading frames encoding Pdx2 and PdxK were amplified by PCR from a P. falciparum cDNA library as template using the sequence-specific antisense and sense oligonucleotides PfPdx2-IB-A3-AS (5′-GCGCGCGGTCTCAGCGCTTGAATATTTGTAATTTTTAACCTTC-3′) PfPdx2-IBA3-S (5′-GCGCCGCGGTCTCGAATGTCAGAAATAACTATAGGGG-3′) PfPdxK-IBA7-NcoI-AS (5′-GCGCCCATGGGCAAAAAAAACAGGCTCTTC-3′), PfPdxK-IBA7-SacII-S (5′-GCGCCCGCGGTATGAAGAAGGAAAATATTATC-3′) PfPdxK-IBA3-NcoI-AS (5′-GCGCCCATGGGCAAAAAAAACAGGCTCTTC-3′) and PfPdxK-IBA3-S-acII-S (5′-GCGCCCGCGGTATGAAGAAGGAAAATATTATCTCC-3′). The PCRs for the plasmodial constructs were performed using Pfu polymerase (Invitrogen) and the following PCR program: 3 min at 95 °C for 1 cycle followed by 35 cycles of 1 min 95 °C, 1.5 min at 42 °C, 3 min at 60 °C. The generated PCR products were digested either with BsaI (PfPdx1, PfPdx2) or with SacII and NcoI (PdxK) and cloned into the expression plasmids pASK-IBA3 and pASK-IBA7 previously digested with the same enzymes, resulting in the expression constructs PfPdx1-IBA3, PfPdx2-IBA3, PfPdxK-IBA3, and PfPdxK-IBA7. The plasmids pASK-IBA7 and pASK-IBA3 encode for an N-terminal or C-terminal Strep-Tag, respectively, that allows one-step purification of the recombinant fusion proteins using Strep-Tactin-Sepharose (23Wrenger C. Lu ̈ersen K. Krause T. Mu ̈ller S. Walter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29651-29656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For cloning into the yeast expression vector pYES2/NT C (Invitrogen), the open reading frames pdx1 and pdx2 were amplified by PCR using the sense and antisense primers PfPdx1-pYES-S (5′-GCGCGGATCCATGGAAAATCATAAAGATGATGC-3′), PfPdx1-pYES-AS (5′-GCGCCTCGAGTTGTGGTGTTAAAAATTTGGTGTG-3′), and PfPdx2-pYES-S (5′-GCGCGGATCCATGTCAGAAATAACTATAGGGG-3′), PfPdx2-pYES-AS (5′-GCGCCTCGAGTGAATATTTGTAATTTTTAACCTTC-3′) on the previously cloned E. coli expression constructs PfPdx1-IBA3 and PfPdx2-IBA3. The PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI and cloned with the same enzyme-digested pYES2/NT C vector, which resulted in the constructs PfPdx1-pYES2/NT and PfPdx2-pYES2/NT. The nucleotide sequences of all PCR fragments and clones were verified by automated nucleotide sequencing using the automatic sequencer ABI 377 (Bio-Rad). Nucleotide and amino acid analyses were performed with the help of Generunner. Expression and Purification of the PfPdx1, PfPdx2, and PfPdxK—E. coli BLR (DE3) (Stratagene) were transformed with the cloned P. falciparum Pdx1, Pdx2, and PdxK constructs. Single colonies were picked and grown overnight in Luria-Bertani medium. The bacterial culture was diluted 1:50 and grown at 37 °C until the OD600 reached 0.5. The expression was initiated with 200 ng ml–1 of anhydrotetracycline, and the cells were grown for 4 h at 37 °C before harvest. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sonicated, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The recombinant Strep-Tag fusion protein was purified according to the manufacturer's recommendation (IBA). The eluate of the affinity chromatography was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the protein was revealed by Coomassie Blue staining (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.47-18.59Google Scholar). The concentration of the purified recombinant protein was determined according to Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211734) Google Scholar). Glutaminase Assay—The glutaminase activity was assayed in two steps, according to Dong et al. (12Dong Y.X. Sueda S. Nikawa J. Kondo H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), by measuring the formation of glutamate, which is subsequently converted to 2-oxoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase with APAD or NADP+ as co-substrate. The enzyme reaction was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 in the presence of 1–10 mm glutamine in a total volume of 300 μl at 30 °C for 10 min. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by boiling for 1 min. A 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 500 μm APAD or NADP+, and 7 units of glutamate dehydrogenase were added to a final volume of 1 ml and incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. Finally, the samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 × g, and the absorbance of the supernatant was determined at 363 or 340 nm in the presence of APAD or NADP+, respectively. The specific activity was calculated with the molar extinction coefficient of APADH (reduced form of APAD) of 8900 m–1 cm–1 and 6220 m–1 cm–1 of NADPH (26Van Kuilenburg A.B. Elzinga L. Van den Berg A.A. Slingerland R.J. Van Gennip A.H. Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 411-415PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the glutaminase activity was performed in the presence of DON at concentrations of 5 and 10 mm. The inhibitor and 150 μg of the equimolar enzyme complex (Pdx1 and Pdx2) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 at a total volume of 1 ml at 30 °C. At varied time points, aliquots were removed and combined with the ingredients of the standard glutaminase assay. Complementation Assay and Western Blot Analysis—A double mutant of S. cerevisiae (genotype: BY4741; Mat a; his3Δ 1; met15Δ 0; ura3Δ 0; leu2Δ 0; YMR095c::kanMX4; YMR096w::LEU2) was generated by SRD (Scientific Research and Development), which led to a deletion of the genes SNO1 and SNZ1 and resulted in vitamin B6 auxotrophy (12Dong Y.X. Sueda S. Nikawa J. Kondo H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This mutant, deficient in pyridoxine biosynthesis, was transformed with the constructs, PfPdx1-pYES2/NT and PfPdx2-pYES2/NT for expression of PfPdx1 and PfPdx2 as N- and C-terminal His fusion proteins in yeast mutants. The complementation of the vitamin B6 auxotrophy was assayed by cultivation in the following minimal medium: d-raffinose, 20 g; (NH4)2SO4, 1.02 g; KH2PO4, 0.875 g; K2HPO4, 0.125 g; CaCl2·H2O, 0.02 g; NaCl, 0.01 g; MgSO4, 7··H2O, 0.05 g; CuSO4 5·H2O, 40 μg; MnSO4·H2O, 400 μg; FeCl3 6·H2O, 200 μg; ZnSO4 7·H2O, 400 μg; Na2MoO4 2·H2O, 200 μg; KI, 100 μg; H3BO3, 500 μg; biotin, 2 μg; inositol, 10 mg; nicotinic acid, 0.2 mg, calcium pantothenate 0.2 mg; histidine, 20 mg; methionine, 20 mg; tryptophan, 20 mg; and agar, 20 g per liter modified according to Dong et al. (12Dong Y.X. Sueda S. Nikawa J. Kondo H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For induction of the expression, 2% galactose was added to the minimal medium. Growth was mediated at 30 °C for 4 days. The recombinant expression of PfPdx1 and PfPdx2 within the yeast mutant was analyzed by a Western blot. Hybridization of the blot was performed with a monoclonal anti-HIS peroxidase-coupled antibody (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:5000. The blot was developed by the usage of the ECL+ detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Enzyme Assay for PfPdxK—Pyridoxine kinase activity was measured according to Kwok and Churchich (27Kwok F. Churchich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6489-6495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The change in absorbance was followed in a double beam spectrophotometer UVICON 933 (BIO-TEK Kontron) by the formation of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, which has an absorption maximum at 388 nm with an extinction coefficient of 4900 m–1 cm–1. The enzyme assay was performed in a total volume of 1 ml at 30 °C with 70 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 containing 400 μm pyridoxal, 3 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2. Kinetic analysis of PfPdxK was carried out in the presence of either 0–600 μm pyridoxal at an ATP concentration of 1 mm or 0–400 μm ATP at a concentration of 600 μm pyridoxal. For analysis of the substrate specificity, the standard assay was executed in a total volume of 150 μl using 400 μm pyridoxal or 400 μm pyridoxamine or 400 μm pyridoxine and 500 μm 250 nCi of [α-32P]dATP. For determining the metal specificity, the standard assay was performed with 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 10 mm of the following metals: MgCl2, ZnCl2, MnCl2, NiCl2, and CaCl2. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, stopped by boiling, and the reaction products were separated by thin-layer chromatography (PEI cellulose F, Merck) using a solvent consisting of 0.5 m LiCl and 1 m formic acid. The ADP spots were visualized by exposure on x-ray films (Retina). Additional kinetic studies were performed in the presence of 0–600 μm pyridoxine and 500 μm ATP containing radioactively labeled ATP, which were also analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and quantified by a liquid scintillation analyzer (TRI-CARB 2000CA, United Instruments Packard). The results were analyzed using GraphPad PRISM 4 (GraphPad software), and the apparent Km values were derived from reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots. Analysis of the Expression of the Plasmodial pdx1, pdx2, and pdxK Genes within the Erythrocytic Stages and the Effect of Oxidative Stress—P. falciparum 3D7 was cultivated according to Trager and Jensen (28Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6029) Google Scholar) in human A+ erythrocytes, RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm glucose and 0.5% Albumax II (Invitrogen). For stage-specific analysis, the parasites were synchronized with 5% sorbitol according to Lambros and Vanderberg (29Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2759) Google Scholar). The highly synchronized cells were harvested 12 ± 4 h (rings), 26 ± 4 h (trophozoites), and 40 ± 4 h (schizonts) after infection. For analysis of oxidative stress, the cells were treated with 1.2 and 6 nm methylene blue for 3 h. The IC50 value for methylene blue in P. falciparum was reported to be ∼4 nm (30Vennerstrom J.L. Makler M.T. Angerhofer C.K. Williams J.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2671-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). At the beginning of the incubation with methylene blue the culture was light-induced, which stimulates the production of singlet oxygen. Isolation of total RNA was performed using saponin-lysed parasites (31Umlas J. Fallon J.N. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1971; 20: 527-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), that were immediately transferred into TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the obtained RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting (32Kyes S. Pinches R. Newbold C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). 25 μg of total RNA of each parasite stage or stressed and nonstressed parasites were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 5 mm guanidine thiocyanate. Subsequently, the RNA was blotted overnight onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Applied Science) before hybridizing the blot with radiolabeled pdx1, pdx2, pdxK probes and, as a loading control, with 18 S rRNA probe using standard procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.47-18.59Google Scholar). After washing the blots twice in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min, they were exposed to x-ray films (Retina) overnight to obtain a detectable signal. Molecular Size of P. falciparum PdxK—The molecular size and the oligomeric state of P. falciparum PdxK were assessed by subjecting the affinity-purified protein to fast protein liquid chromatography on a calibrated Superdex S-200 (1 cm × 30 cm) equilibrated with 70 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 containing 200 mm KCl and 10 mm MgCl2. Accession Numbers of the Enzymes Used in This Work—Accession numbers are: PfPdx1 NP_703871 and P. falciparum pyridoxine kinase (PfPdxK) NP_703820. Analyses of the Plasmodial Pdx1, Pdx2, and PdxK Sequences—To identify plasmodial genes involved in a hypothetical vitamin B6 biosynthesis pathway TBLASTN searches were performed in the Plasmodium genome data base (www.plasmodb.org) using the deduced amino acid sequence of the S. cerevisiae open reading frames SNZ1and SNO1 and the open reading frame of the human pdxK. The genes encoding for Pdx1, Pdx2, and PdxK were found in the P. falciparum genome. The pdx1 gene resides on chromosome 6 in P. falciparum. The size of the pdx1 open reading frame is 906 bp, and the gene does not contain introns. The deduced polypeptide consists of 301 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 33 kDa. The protein sequence is well conserved and shows identities of 53% to corresponding proteins of S. cerevisiae (AC: Q03148), Methanosacina acetivorans (AC: Q8TQH6), and B. subtilis (AC: P37527). In S. cerevisiae Snz1-p (corresponding to Pdx1 in P. falciparum) is encoded by a gene family consisting of 3 members that share sequence identities of at least 80% to each other. However, they are encoded on different chromosomes (10Padilla P.A. Fuge E.K. Crawford M.E. Errett A. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BLAST searches within the Plasmodium genome data base revealed no gene duplication in P. falciparum, and pdx1 appeared to be a single copy gene. In E. coli, two proteins (PdxA and PdxJ) act together for the ring closure of pyridoxine (6Yang Y. Zhao G. Man T.K. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4294-4299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae Snz1-p and Sno1-p are responsible for the de novo synthesis of vitamin B6. A homologue counterpart to Sno1-p was found in the P. falciparum genome on chromosome 11. The open reading frame of pdx2 consists of 660 bp, and the deduced amino acid sequence encodes for a polypeptide of 219 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 24 kDa. The pdx2 gene is predicted to be a single copy gene, which is disrupted by six introns with sizes of 76, 146, 150, 96, 167, and 148 bp, respectively. The protein seems to belong to the SNO glutamine amidotransferase family. This family possesses the same conserved amino acid residue as in all other known Pdx2-p/Sno1-p proteins like the motifs GGEST and FHPE (11Ehrenshaft M. Daub M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3383-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Additionally, the plasmodial Pdx2 protein displays the motif WGTCA that is highly conserved among fungal Pdx2-p/Sno1-p proteins. Furthermore the motifs GVLALQG and FIRAP, also well preserved in fungi and are substituted by GVLSLQG and CIRAP, respectively. The amino acid sequence of PfPdx2 shares identities of 31, 26 and 29% to the Sno1-p/Pdx2 proteins of S. cerevisiae (AC: NP 013813), M. acetivorans (AC: NP 616499), and A. thaliana (AC: NP 568922), respectively. To obtain a functional cofactor, pyridoxal needs to be phosphorylated in a reaction that is catalyzed by PdxK. Pyridoxal/pyridoxine kinases are metal-dependent enzymes, that generally accept all three vitamin B6 derivates (pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxal) as substrates. The open reading frame of the plasmodial PdxK contains 1494 bp and encodes for a polypeptide of 497 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 57.2 kDa. The genomic sequence of pdxK is interrupted by two introns of 142 and 139 bp (33Gardner M.J. Hall N. Fung E. White O. Berriman M. Hyman R.W. Carlton J.M. Pain A. Nelson K.E. Bowman S. Paulsen I.T.

Barrell B. Nature. 2002; 419: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (3370) Google Scholar). The plasmodial PdxK shows 14, 12, and 14% identities to pyridoxal kinases from H. sapiens (AC: O00764), E. coli (AC: NP 416913), and A. thaliana (AC: Q8W1X2). The amino acid residues known to be involved in pyridoxal binding are conserved in the PfPdxK. Ser-12, Thr-47, Tyr-84, and Asp-235 in the mammalian pyridoxal kinase are at the respective positions Ser-11, Thr-46, Tyr-83, and Asp-430 in the plasmodial counterpart. The amino acid residues Tyr-84 and Val-19 are involved in stabilizing the pyridoxal ring within the active site (34Li M.H. Kwok F. Chang W.R. Liu S.Q. Lo S.C. Zhang J.P. Jiang T. Liang D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17459-17465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, Val-19 in the mammalian pyridoxal kinase is substituted by Cys-18 in PfPdxK. The amino acid residues participating in ATP binding, either directly or via cations, are Thr-186, Ser-187, Asn-150, Glu-153, Asp-118, Tyr-127, and Thr-148 (34Li M.H. Kwok F. Chang W.R. Liu S.Q.

They appear to be conserved at their respective positions in the plasmodial protein. It has been reported that Asp-118, Tyr-127 (Asp-323 and Tyr-328 in the PfPdxK), and the connecting 10 amino acid residues are responsible for the prevention of spontaneous ATP hydrolysis (35Li M.H. Kwok F. Chang W.R. Lau C.K. Zhang J.P. Lo S.C. Jiang T. Liang D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46385-46390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the link between these two conserved amino acid residues is restricted to 6 amino acid residues in the plasmodial enzyme. Interestingly, the PfPdxK sequence is broken up by a spacer consisting of 207 amino acid residues. Long insertions have also been identified in several plasmodial proteins such as γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and the bifunctional ODC/AdoMetDC (36Lu ̈ersen K. Walter R.D. Mu ̈ller S. Mol. Biochem.

The enzyme is known to belong to the GHMP superfamily of small molecule kinases and has attracted significant research attention for well over 40 years. Approximately 20 mutations have now been identified in human galactokinase, which result in the diseased state referred to as Type II galactosemia. Here we report the three-dimensional architecture of human galactokinase with bound α-d-galactose and Mg-AMPPNP. The overall fold of the molecule can be described in terms of two domains with the active site wedged between them. The N-terminal domain is dominated by a six-stranded mixed β-sheet whereas the C-terminal motif contains six α-helices and two layers of anti-parallel β-sheet. Those residues specifically involved in sugar binding include Arg37, Glu43, His44, Asp46, Gly183, Asp186, and Tyr236. The C-1 hydroxyl group of α-d-galactose sits within 3.3 Å of the γ-phosphorus of the nucleotide and 3.4 Å of the guanidinium group of Arg37. The carboxylate side chain of Asp186 lies within ∼3.2 Å of the C-2 hydroxyl group of α-d-galactose and the guanidinium group of Arg37. Both Arg37 and Asp186 are strictly conserved among both prokaryotic and eukaryotic galactokinases. In addition to providing molecular insight into the active site geometry of the enzyme, the model also provides a structural framework upon which to more fully understand the consequences of the those mutations known to give rise to Type II galactosemia.

The overall fold of the molecule can be described in terms of two domains with the active site wedged between them. The N-terminal domain is dominated by a six-stranded mixed β-sheet whereas the C-terminal motif contains six α-helices and two layers of anti-parallel β-sheet. Those residues specifically involved in sugar binding include Arg37, Glu43, His44, Asp46, Gly183, Asp186, and Tyr236. The C-1 hydroxyl group of α-d-galactose sits within 3.3 Å of the γ-phosphorus of the nucleotide and 3.4 Å of the guanidinium group of Arg37. The carboxylate side chain of Asp186 lies within ∼3.2 Å of the C-2 hydroxyl group of α-d-galactose and the guanidinium group of Arg37. Both Arg37 and Asp186 are strictly conserved among both prokaryotic and eukaryotic galactokinases. In addition to providing molecular insight into the active site geometry of the enzyme, the model also provides a structural framework upon which to more fully understand the consequences of the those mutations known to give rise to Type II galactosemia. In most organisms, the conversion of β-d-galactose to glucose-1-phosphate is accomplished by the action of four enzymes that constitute the Leloir pathway as indicated in Scheme 1 (1Caputto R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 43885-43888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Galactokinase (EC 2.7.1.6), the focus of this investigation, catalyzes the second step in the pathway, namely the MgATP-dependent phosphorylation of the C-1 hydroxyl group of α-d-galactose to yield galactose-1-phosphate (5Wilkinson J.F. Biochem. J. 1949; 44: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 6Howard S.M. Heinrich M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1965; 110: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus far, ∼20 mutations (including base substitutions, base deletions, and larger deletions) have been identified in human galactokinase, which result in the diseased state referred to as Type II galactosemia (MIM 230200). This disease, the main symptom of which is early onset cataracts, is less severe than either Type I or Type III galactosemia, which are caused by defects in the galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase or UDP-galactose 4-epimerase genes, respectively (7Segal S.

Dis. 2002; 25: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of cataract formation is unclear but it is thought to be similar to that sometimes suffered by diabetics. High blood concentrations of galactose (or glucose in the case of diabetics) result in high concentrations of the sugar being transported into the lens cells of the eye. These cells have unusually high levels of the enzyme aldose reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of the sugar to its corresponding sugar alcohol galactitol (dulcitol) in the case of galactosemics and sorbitol in the case of diabetics (11Yabe-Nishimura C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 21-33PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ai Y. Zheng Z. O'Brien-Jenkins A. Bernard D.J. Wynshaw-Boris T. Ning C. Reynolds R. Segal S. Huang K. Stambolian D. Hum. Mol.

It appears that this uptake of water leads to damage and ultimately to the formation of cataracts. Within the last year, the crystal structures of two bacterial galactokinases were reported (16Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33305-33311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Hartley A. Glynn S.E. Barynin V. Baker P.J. Sedelnikova S.E. Verhees C. de Geus D. van der Oost J. Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Rice D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The structure of the enzyme from Lactococcus lactis was solved in the presence of galactose and a phosphate ion whereas that from Pyrococcus furiosus was determined with galactose and MgADP bound in the active site (16Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33305-33311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Hartley A. Glynn S.E. Barynin V. Baker P.J. Sedelnikova S.E.

Many of the equivalent residues to the sites of disease-causing mutations in the human enzyme could be located in both models and speculations were made about the reason for structural or kinetic dysfunction (18Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2471-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, not all the disease-causing mutations could be mapped unambiguously onto these bacterial enzyme structures. Galactokinase is known to be a member of the GHMP superfamily of small molecule kinases, which includes homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase, among others (reviewed in Ref. 18Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2471-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, this family of proteins was originally identified on the basis of amino acid sequence identity (19Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). According to all presently available structural and biochemical data, members of this family can be subdivided into two groups depending upon their catalytic mechanisms. The crystal structure of rat mevalonate kinase in complex with ATP shows an aspartate residue (Asp204) in the active site which is positioned to act as a catalytic base and a lysine residue (Lys13) that is thought to influence the pKa of the substrate hydroxyl group (20Fu Z. Wang M. Potter D. Miziorko H.M. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18134-18142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, in Escherichia coli homoserine kinase, the equivalent residue to the aspartate is an asparagine (Asn141), and there appears to be no other suitable residue close enough to act as a catalytic base (21Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Krishna S.S. Zhou T. Daugherty M. Osterman A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is no adjacent positively charged residue. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that homoserine kinase achieves catalysis through transition state stabilization alone (22Krishna S.S. Zhou T. Daugherty M. Osterman A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Which of the two subgroups galactokinase falls into is presently unclear. The crystal structures of the enzyme from both L. lactis and P. furiosus reveal an aspartate residue in an approximately equivalent position to that found in mevalonate kinase and an arginine occupying the same position as Lys13 (16Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33305-33311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Hartley A. Glynn S.E. Barynin V. Baker P.J. Sedelnikova S.E. Verhees C. de Geus D. van der Oost J. Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Rice D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, enzymological studies on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme (which also has an equivalent aspartate residue) showed little variation in the turnover number and specificity constants with respect to pH and negligible effects on addition of increasing mol fractions of deuterium oxide in place of water (23Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarly, the human enzyme showed no solvent deuterium isotope effect (24Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both experiments would have been expected to show some effect on these kinetic constants if an ionizable residue was involved in a reaction step reflected in the measured parameters (25Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press, London2004: 209-229Google Scholar). Here we report the three-dimensional structure of human galactokinase in complex with Mg-AMPPNP 1The abbreviation used is: AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)-triphosphate. and α-d-galactose, determined to a nominal resolution of 2.5 Å. This investigation has allowed for a more complete description of the active site geometry of galactokinase and has unambiguously revealed the locations of the mutations known to cause Type II galactosemia. Expression of the Selenomethionine-labeled Protein—Cultures of E. coli HMS174(DE3) cells harboring the plasmid encoding the human GALK1 gene, as described in Ref. 24Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, were grown overnight in M9 minimal medium at 37 °C. Subsequently, 15 ml of the overnight culture were used to inoculate each of 12 × 2-liter baffled flasks containing 500 ml of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 5 mg/liter thiamine. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of ∼0.9 and then cooled for 10 min in an ice/water bath. They were then transferred to an incubator at 16 °C, and each flask was supplemented with 50 mg each of lysine, threonine, and phenylalanine and 25 mg each of leucine, isoleucine, valine, and selenomethionine. Following 20 min of additional growth, the cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to grow for an additional 18 h. Subsequently, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the cell paste frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -80 °C. Note that the recombinant plasmid employed in this investigation results in a His6 tag at the N terminus of the protein. Protein Purification—All protein purification steps were conducted on ice or at 4 °C. The cell paste was thawed in three volumes of lysis buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 100 mm galactose (pH 8). Cells were lysed with four cycles of sonication and cooling (45 s of sonication separated by 5 min of cooling). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a 10 ml Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer. After loading, the column was washed with 100 ml of lysis buffer, followed by 100 ml of wash buffer, which contained an additional 10 mm imidazole. The protein was recovered by a linear gradient elution with 20–300 mm imidazole in the lysis buffer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled on the basis of purity as visualized by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes, 200 mm NaCl, and 100 mm d-galactose (pH 8). The dialyzed protein was concentrated to ∼7 mg/ml based on a calculated extinction coefficient of 2.05 ml/(mg·cm) (DNAstar Inc., Madison, WI). Galactose-dependent ATPase activity was verified using the standard pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay. Crystallization—Large single crystals were grown at room temperature via batch methods using 6–8% polyethylene glycol 8000, 2% Me2SO, 10 mm Mg-AMPPNP, and 100 mm HEPPS (pH 8). These crystals achieved typical dimensions of 0.5 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm in 2–3 weeks and belonged to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 73.2, b = 109.6, and c = 115.8 and β = 95.9°. The asymmetric unit contained four polypeptide chains. High Resolution X-ray Data Collection—Prior to flash-cooling, the crystals were harvested from the batch experiments and equilibrated in a synthetic mother liquor composed of 15% polyethylene glycol 8000, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm d-galactose, 10 mm Mg-AMPPNP, 2% Me2SO, and 100 mm HEPPS (pH 8). The crystals were then serially transferred to a cryoprotectant solution composed of 25% polyethylene glycol 8000, 250 mm NaCl, 100 mm d-galactose, 2% Me2SO, 15% ethylene glycol, and 100 mm HEPPS (pH 8). X-ray data were collected on a CCD detector at the COMCAT 32-ID beamline (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). All x-ray data were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar).

The software package SOLVE was utilized to determine the positions of the 32 selenium atoms in the asymmetric unit and to generate initial protein phases (figure-of-merit = 0.5) (27Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Solvent flattening and molecular averaging of the four polypeptide chains in the asymmetric unit with RESOLVE (figure-of-merit = 0.65) resulted in an interpretable electron density map calculated to 2.5-Å resolution (28Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). The “averaged” map allowed for a complete tracing of the structure (392 amino acids) with the exception of several residues at the N terminus and a surface loop near His229 to Ser233. Four copies of the model were placed back into the asymmetric unit and alternate cycles of manual model building and least-squares refinement with the software package TNT reduced the R-factor to 20.1% for all measured x-ray data from 20.0- to 2.5-Å resolution (29Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The crystals diffracted to ∼2.1-Å resolution, but because of anisotropy in the diffraction pattern, the least-squares refinement was truncated at 2.5-Å resolution. Relevant refinement statistics are presented in Table II. A Ramachandran plot analysis indicates that 85.1, 14.6, and 0.3% of the residues are in the most favored, the additional allowed, and the generously allowed regions, respectively.Table IILeast squares refinement statisticsResolution limits (Å)20.0–2.5R-factoraR-factor = (Σ|Fo - Fc|/Σ|Fo|) × 100, where Fo is the observed structure-factor amplitude, and Fc is the calculated structure-factor amplitude (overall) %/ no. reflections20.5/61550R-factor (working) %/ no. reflections20.1/55451R-factor (free) %/ no. reflections25.8/6099No. protein atomsbThis value includes multiple conformations for Glu70 in chain A and Arg297 in chain D12367No. heteroatomscThese include 4 galactose molecules, 4 AMPPNP, 4 Mg2+, and 384 waters560Average B values (Å2)Protein atoms45.9α-d-Galactose ligands33.6AMPPNP ligands40.5Magnesium ions33.5Waters45.5Weighted root mean square deviations from idealityBond lengths (Å)0.013Bond angles (degree)2.13Trigonal planes (Å)0.007General planes (Å)0.015Torsional angles (deg)dThe torsional angles were not restrained during the refinement18.8a R-factor = (Σ|Fo - Fc|/Σ|Fo|) × 100, where Fo is the observed structure-factor amplitude, and Fc is the calculated structure-factor amplitudeb This value includes multiple conformations for Glu70 in chain A and Arg297 in chain Dc These include 4 galactose molecules, 4 AMPPNP, 4 Mg2+, and 384 watersd The torsional angles were not restrained during the refinement Open table in a new tab Structure of Human Galactokinase—The crystals of human galactokinase employed in this investigation contained four polypeptide chains in the asymmetric unit. In that the electron density was best defined for the fourth molecule, the following discussion will refer specifically to it unless otherwise stated. Note, however, that the backbone α-carbon atoms for the individual polypeptide chains in the asymmetric unit superimpose upon one another with root mean-square deviations of between 0.31 and 0.42 Å. As indicated in Fig. 1a, the structure of human galactokinase, with overall dimensions of ∼44 Å × 56 Å × 63 Å, can be envisioned as two domains. The N-terminal region initiates with a long α-helix of 15 residues, which flanks one side of a six-stranded mixed β-sheet. A four helical bundle surrounds the other side of this β-sheet. The C-terminal domain is dominated by six α-helices and two layers of anti-parallel β-sheet, each containing four strands. The location of the three structural motifs characteristic of the GHMP superfamily are indicated in Fig. 1a. Motif I, having the sequence 38Val-Asn-Leu-Ile-Gly-Glu-His44, abuts one side of the galactose moiety where the side chain of Glu43 and the backbone peptidic nitrogen of His44 participate in hydrogen bonding interactions with the C-6 hydroxyl group of the sugar. In human galactokinase, Motif II is formed by 136Gly-Gly-Gly-Leu-Ser-Ser-Ser-Ala-Ser144 and envelopes the phosphoryl moieties of the nucleotide. Finally, Motif III, as indicated in Fig. 1a, is formed by 343Met-Thr-Gly-Gly-Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly350. The backbone peptidic nitrogen of Gly346 lies within 3 Å of a γ-phosphoryl oxygen of AMPPNP. There are three cis-prolines in human galactokinase at positions 85, 104, and 121. Earlier reports suggested that the quaternary structures of the galactokinases from E. coli, L. lactis, P. furiosus, yeast, and human are monomeric, whereas that isolated from Vicia faba seeds is dimeric (16Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33305-33311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Hartley A. Glynn S.E. Barynin V. Baker P.J. Sedelnikova S.E.

Analysis of the crystalline packing arrangement for the four molecules in the asymmetric unit reveals that, in this study, they associate as dimers through similar secondary structural elements. One such dimer, formed between molecules 3 and 4 (as listed in the deposited coordinate file) is displayed in Fig. 1b. The total surface area buried upon dimer formation, as calculated with a probe radius of 1.4 Å is ∼1750 Å2 (33Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). The subunit:subunit interface is formed primarily by two loops (Ser160-Ile163 and Gly193-Lys195), and two β-strands (Glu207-Pro212 and Lys388-Cys391) contributed by each subunit. Indeed, the β-strand defined by Glu207 to Pro212 extends the four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet in the C-domain of one subunit into an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet across the dimer interface. The residues involved in the formation of the subunit:subunit interface are not conserved among eukaryotic galactokinases. As indicated in Fig. 1b, there is a disulfide bridge formed by the side chains of Cys391 (one from each subunit). This occurs in both dimers in the asymmetric unit and is most likely a function of the crystallization conditions. Whether the dimeric quaternary structure of human galactokinase observed in this investigation is merely a function of crystalline packing or represents the state of the enzyme in vivo is unknown. Active Site of Human Galactokinase—Electron density corresponding to the bound ligands, α-d-galactose and Mg-AMP-PNP, is presented in Fig. 2a. Those amino acid residues lying within ∼3.5 Å of the sugar or nucleotide are displayed in Fig. 2b. The adenine base of AMPPNP adopts the anti-conformation and participates in a stacking interaction with the indole ring of Trp106. The nucleotide ribose assumes the C3′-endo pucker. Tyr109 sits near the nucleotide ribose with its side chain pointing toward O6R as indicated in Fig. 2b. Immediately following Motif II, there is a rather long α-helix of 16 residues positioned with the positive end of its helix dipole moment directed toward the phosphoryl groups of the nucleotide. The three serine residues in Motif II aid in anchoring the phosphoryl groups of the nucleotide within the active site cleft. Specifically, Oγ of Ser142 sits at 3.2 Å and 2.7 Å, respectively, from an α- and a β-phosphoryl oxygen while Oγ of Ser141 is located within 2.8 Å of a β-phosphoryl oxygen. Additionally, the backbone peptidic nitrogen of Ser140 is positioned within 2.8 Å of a γ-phosphoryl oxygen and the backbone peptidic nitrogen of Ser141 lies within 2.9 Å a β-phosphoryl oxygen. The magnesium ion is wedged between α-, β-, and γ-phosphoryl oxygens with metal:oxygen distances of 2.3, 2.6, and 2.3 Å, respectively. At a resolution of 2.5 Å, it is not possible to completely define the coordination geometry surrounding the metal ion. A closeup stereo view of potential interactions between the protein and both the sugar and the γ-phosphoryl group of AMPPNP is presented in Fig. 3. The C-1 hydroxyl oxygen, which is phosphorylated during the reaction, sits between two of the γ-phosphoryl oxygens of the nucleotide and lies within 3.3 Å of the γ-phosphorus. The side chain nitrogen of Arg37, namely Nη2, is within 3.4 Å of the galactose C-1 hydroxyl group and 3.1 Å of the third γ-phosphoryl oxygen. In the case of mevalonate kinase, for example, it has been postulated that a similarly positioned lysine residue serves both to lower the pKa of the C-5 hydroxyl group of mevalonate and to aid in stabilization of the presumed pentacoordinated γ-phosphate transition state (20Fu Z. Wang M. Potter D. Miziorko H.M. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18134-18142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 3, the carboxylate group of Asp186 interacts with the C-2 hydroxyl of galactose (3.2 Å) and sits at 3.8 Å from the galactose C-1 hydroxyl group. Both Arg37 and Asp186 are strictly conserved among galactokinase sequences reported to date. Other side chains involved in anchoring the sugar substrate to the protein include Asp46 which bridges O-3 and O-4 of galactose (2.7 and 2.6 Å), Tyr236, which interacts with O-4 (2.7 Å), and Glu43 which hydrogen bonds to O-6 (2.3 Å). In addition to side chain/sugar interactions, the backbone peptidic groups of Gly183 and His44 form hydrogen bonds with O-3 and O-6 of galactose, respectively. A recent investigation of sugar recognition by human galactokinase demonstrated that 2-deoxy-d-galactose also functions as a substrate for the enzyme but N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, l-arabinose, d-fucose, and d-glucose are not phosphorylated (34Timson D.J. Reece R.J. BMC Biochem. 2003; 4: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Assuming that for catalysis to occur, all of the above-mentioned sugars must bind to the protein in a similar orientation as that observed for galactose, it is now possible to provide a structural explanation for these results. In the case of N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, it is not possible to position the sugar into the active site without steric clashes arising between its N-acetyl group and the side chains of Glu174, Met180, Cys182, Asp186, and/or the phosphoryl groups of AMPPNP. Both l-arabinose (a five carbon analog of galactose) and d-fucose (6-deoxygalactose) are missing the C-6 hydroxyl group. As shown in Fig. 3, both the side chain of Glu43 and the peptidic nitrogen of His44 participate in hydrogen bonding interactions with O-6 of galactose. The loss of these two electrostatic interactions between the protein and either l-arabinose or d-fucose most likely results in the inability of the respective sugar to bind to the enzyme. This is further supported by biochemical data demonstrating that these sugars do not function as inhibitors of the galactokinase reaction thereby ruling out an explanation of non-productive binding (34Timson D.J.

Interestingly, in the recent study of the sugar specificity exhibited by human galactokinase, it was shown that replacing Glu43 with an alanine residue resulted in little effect on the steady state kinetics of the enzyme with its natural substrate, α-d-galactose. Hence, while the abolition of the C-6 hydroxyl group in arabinose and fucose results in no catalytic activity, deleting the side chain carboxylate of Glu43 causes little change in the steady state kinetics of the enzyme. This contradiction can now be rationalized on the basis of the structure presented here. Replacement of Glu43 with an alanine results in the loss of only one of the two hydrogen bonding interactions that occur between the protein and the normal sugar substrate. The hydrogen bond formed between the C-6 hydroxyl group of galactose and the peptidic NH group of His44 most likely remains intact and thus still serves to properly orient the sugar within the active site. Finally, d-glucose and d-galactose differ simply by the hydroxyl configuration about C-4. Due to this difference in configuration, however, the hydroxyl group in glucose is no longer in the correct position to participate in hydrogen bonding interactions with the side chains of Asp46 and Tyr236. Again, d-glucose does not function as a competitive inhibitor (34Timson D.J. Reece R.J. BMC Biochem. 2003; 4: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Implications for the Catalytic Mechanism of Galactokinase— The catalytic mechanisms of both homoserine kinase and mevalonate kinase, both members of the GHMP superfamily, have been the subject of several recent investigations (20Fu Z.

https://openalex.org/W2060650331,"Plasmodium sporozoites, injected by mosquitoes into the skin of the host, traverse cells during their migration to hepatocytes where they continue their life cycle. The mechanisms used by the parasite to rupture the plasma membrane of the host cells are not known. Here we report the presence of a phospholipase on the surface of Plasmodium berghei sporozoites (P. berghei phospholipase; Pb PL) and demonstrate that it is involved in the establishment of a malaria infection in vivo. Pb PL is highly conserved among the Plasmodium species. The protein is about 750 amino acids, with a predicted signal sequence and a carboxyl terminus that is 32% identical to the vertebrate lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, a secreted phospholipase. Pb PL contains a motif characteristic of lipases and a catalytic triad of a serine, aspartate, and histidine that is found in several phospholipases. We have verified its lipase and membrane lytic activity in vitro, using recombinant baculovirus-expressed protein. To study its role in vivo, we have disrupted the P. berghei PL open reading frame and generated mutants in its active site. During an infection through mosquito bite, the infectivity of the knock-out parasites in the liver is decreased by ∼90%. The prepatent period of the resulting blood infection is 1 day longer as compared with wild type. Further, the mutant sporozoites are impaired in their ability to cross epithelial cell layers.

Thus, the Pb PL functions as a lipase to damage cell membranes and facilitates sporozoite passage through cells during their migration from the skin to the bloodstream. Malaria is caused by protozoan parasites of the Plasmodium genus that are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. As the mosquito probes for a blood vessel during its bite, it deposits parasite forms termed sporozoites underneath the skin (1Ponnudurai T. Lensen A.H. van Gemert G.J. Bolmer M.G. Meuwissen J.H. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1991; 85: 175-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Sporozoites stay at the site of bite in the skin for at least 30 min (2Sidjanski S. Vanderberg J.P. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1997; 57: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), during which time they migrate through cells of the avascular tissue before they are able to invade the dermal blood vessels (3Vanderberg J.P. Frevert U. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). After a short time in circulation and arrest in the liver sinuoids, the sporozoites traverse Kupffer cells (4Pradel G. Frevert U. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1154-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the resident macrophages of the liver sinusoidal lining, and infect hepatocytes. This is an active process that probably involves the formation of a moving junction between the parasite and host cell membrane (5Kappe S.H. Buscaglia C.A. Nussenzweig V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 29-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This leads to the formation of a parasitophorous vacuole, in which the sporozoite develops into exoerythrocytic forms (EEFs). 1The abbreviations used are: EEF, exoerythrocytic form; Pb PL, P. berghei phospholipase; ORF, open reading frame; PLA2, phospholipase A2; PC, phosphatidylcholine; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; WT, wild type; LCAT, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase; KO, knock-out. In contrast, sporozoite migration through tissue layers involves the breaching and subsequent repair of the cell plasma membrane (6Mota M.M. Pradel G. Vanderberg J.P. Hafalla J.C. Frevert U. Nussenzweig R.S. Nussenzweig V. Rodriguez A. Science. 2001; 291: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The mechanisms used to rupture the cell membrane are unknown. In this paper, we characterize a protein, Plasmodium berghei phospholipase (Pb PL), that plays a crucial role in this process, during the migration of sporozoites from the site of mosquito bite in the skin into the bloodstream. Pb PL was found in a suppressive, subtractive hybridization scheme (7Matuschewski K. Ross J. Brown S.M. Kaiser K. Nussenzweig V. Kappe S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41948-41953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) that identified genes specifically up-regulated in salivary gland sporozoites that are highly infectious to the vertebrate host, compared with midgut sporozoites that are virtually noninfectious to the vertebrate host (8Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1975; 61: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Parasite Maintenance—Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were fed on infected Swiss-Webster mice, and sporozoites were dissected from their salivary glands at days 18–21 postfeeding. Dissections of mosquito salivary glands were performed in RPMI medium containing 3% bovine serum albumin. The glands were mechanically disrupted, and the debris was pelleted after a spin at 500 rpm. Infectivity of salivary glands was similar for wild type, knock-out, and mutant parasites at ∼4000 sporozoites/mosquito. Construction of the Pb PL Gene Disruption and Modification Plasmid—For the gene replacement vector, two fragments of the Pb PL gene were amplified using PCR and cloned into either side of a dihydrofolate reductase/thymidylate synthase-green fluorescent protein cassette present in the vector pMD205-GFP, described previously as pPyrFlu (9Sultan A.A. Thathy V. Nussenzweig V. Menard R. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2602-2606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ fragment was amplified using 5′-CTCGAGATAAGGCATGCAAAAAAACAC and 5′-CTCGAGCATTCGAAAAATTACCCGTTCC. Both oligonucleotides contain sites for XhoI (in boldface type), allowing the product to be cloned into the XhoI site of the vector. The 3′ fragment was amplified using 5′-GGATCCTTAATGTACCATTTGCTGG and 5′-ACTAGTGAATAAAGTGCGTATCTTGG. These oligonucleotides contained sites for BamHI (in boldface type) and SpeI (in boldface type) respectively, allowing the product to be cloned into BamHI and SpeI sites of the vector. The insert was released using KpnI and SacII, for replacement of the genomic locus, thus generating a “knock-out” parasite. For the gene modification vector, full-length Pb PL was amplified from P. berghei wild type genomic DNA using the following primers that contain sites (in boldface type) for NotI and SpeI respectively: 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTTAATTAGTTGTATTTTTATCTATG and 5′-AACTAGTATGCAAGCATTTCTCTTTATAATCATATTATATAACTGGATATGTTTGGCGTTAATT. The product was cloned into a described previously targeting vector pMD 205 (10Nunes A. Thathy V. Bruderer T. Sultan A.A. Nussenzweig R.S. Menard R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using NotI and SpeI. The active site amino acids (Ser495, Asp700, and His728) were mutated to alanine using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's protocol. Each mutation was marked by a unique restriction enzyme site. We also introduced a stop codon at amino acid 5 of the PL gene. The resulting plasmid was used for parasite transfection after linearization with AflII. As a result of plasmid integration, there is expression only of the mutant Pb PL (Ser495 → Ala, Asp700 → Ala, and His728 → Ala) protein. Reverse Transcription—RNA was extracted from 1 million sporozoites using the micro-FAST-TRACK kit (Invitrogen). Equal amounts were reverse transcribed either in the presence or absence of reverse transcriptase using the Advantage reverse transcription-PCR kit (Stratagene). The cDNA obtained was used as template in PCRs to amplify circumsporozoite (CS) and Pb PL using gene-specific oligonucleotides. For the CS gene, the following primers were used: CSFor, 5′-CTTATATCCCAAGCGCGG; CSRev, 3′-ACATTTATCCATTTTAC. For the PL gene, the following primers were used: PB62, CTCGAGCATTAGAAAAATACCCGTTCC; PB75, AACTAGTATGCAAGCATTTCTCTTTAT. Parasite Transfection and Selection—P. berghei transfection and selection of clones was performed as described previously (11Menard R. Janse C. Methods. 1997; 13: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In order to differentiate between the Pb PL modified parasite clones that had undergone insertion and carried the mutation and those in which the mutation had been corrected, we amplified the region encompassing the Pb PL open reading frame (ORF) from mutant parasites and subjected the PCR product to restriction digestion with the introduced enzymes (data not shown). The presence of the amino acid substitutions was confirmed in the clones used for further study. Antibody Preparation and Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay—Antibodies were raised in mice against a glutathione S-transferase-Pb PL fusion protein. DNA encoding amino acids 540–610 of Pb PL were amplified using the following oligonucleotides: PB110, 5′-TCCCCCGGGTAATAATTATACGC; PB111, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTATGCTTTGAGCAAGTTTC. The product was cloned upstream of glutathione S-transferase in the pGex4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) using SmaI and XhoI. The recombinant protein was purified on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and used for immunization of Balb/c mice. Salivary gland sporozoites were air-dried and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Sporozoites were stained with anti-Pb PL antisera at a dilution of 1:200 at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h with Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. Cryoimmunoelectron Microscopy—Salivary glands from P. berghei-infected A. stephensi mosquitoes were fixed for 2 days at 4 °C with 8% paraformaldehyde in 0.25 m HEPES, pH 7.4, infiltrated, frozen, and sectioned as described previously (12Folsch H. Pypaert M. Schu P. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The sections were labeled first with mouse anti-Pb PL antibodies (1:50 in PBS, 1% fish skin gelatin) followed by anti-mouse IgG antibodies and 5-nm protein A-gold particles (Department of Cell Biology, Medical School, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands), before examination with a Philips CM 120 electron microscope (Eindhoven, The Netherlands) under 80 kV. Expression of Pb PL in the Baculovirus System—PyPL was amplified using the following oligonucleotides, which contain sites (in boldface type) for BamHI and XbaI, respectively, and introduce a His6 tag at the carboxyl terminus of the recombinant protein: PB112, 5′-GGATCCAGTGCTTATAAAAACACCTTAT; PB113, 5′-TCTAGATTAATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATTAGTTCTATTTTGATTTATGAT. The PCR product was cloned into pAcGP67A baculovirus transfer vector (BD Pharmigen) using BamHI and XhoI. SF9 insect cells were co-transfected with the PyPL transfer vector and linearized baculovirus genomic DNA, following the manufacturer's protocol (BD Pharmigen). After initial passages in SF21 cells, further infection was carried out in High Five cells. The supernatant containing recombinant protein was harvested 129 h postinfection. The supernatant was centrifuged to remove cell debris and used for further analysis. Expression of PyPL-His (6×) in the supernatant was confirmed through Western blotting using an anti-His monoclonal antibody (data not shown). Enzymatic Assay for Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and Hemolysis Activity—The assay for phospholipase activity is based on the assay described for human lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) (13Parks J.S. Gebre A.K. Furbee J.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 109: 123-131PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μg of l-α-dipalmitolyl, [choline-methyl-3H]phosphatidylcholine was used as substrate in the lipase reaction. The resulting species, of lyso-PC, free fatty acid, and uncleaved PC, were separated by thin layer chromatography and measured by liquid scintillation counting. Fractional fatty acid hydrolysis is calculated as follows: counts/min (cpm) of lyso-PC/(cpm of lyso-PC + PC). Supernatant from cells infected with baculovirus expressing either PyPL or the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor (14Hu J. Liu J. Ghirlando R. Saltiel A.R. Hubbard S.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1379-1389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was used as the enzyme source. The reaction was carried out for 3 h at 37 °C using 150 μl of the supernatant. Hemolysis was measured using sheep red blood cells (15Abubakar M.S. Nok A.J. Abdurahman E.M. Haruna A.K. Shok M. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2003; 17: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The red blood cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. The pellet was resuspended to a make a 10% (v/v) suspension. In the final lysis reaction mix, the red blood cells were suspended to 1% and incubated with Pb PL or control at 37 °C with gentle shaking for 48 h. Hemolysis in each sample was quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 550 nm. Time dependence of the hemolysis reaction was determined in a total volume of 1.3 ml, using 1.2 ml of either supernatant from cells infected with baculovirus expressing either Pb PL or the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor (16Wei L. Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8122-8130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In order to determine the concentration dependence, the hemolysis reaction was carried out for 60 h. Determination of Prepatent Period—Young SD rats were infected through one of two routes: (a) intravenous injection of 10,000 sporozoites or (b) the bite of infected mosquitoes. Mosquito infectivity was determined by counting the number of sporozoites obtained from dissecting salivary glands of 50 mosquitoes infected with the appropriate parasites. To carry out an infection through mosquito bite, rats were anesthetized and placed on top of a mosquito cage covered with a fine sieve cloth that allows for mosquito probing and biting of the rat abdomen. Six rats (in two groups of three rats each) were bitten by mosquitoes infected with wild type, and another six rats (in two groups of three rats each) were bitten by mosquitoes infected with mutant parasites. Each group of three rats was bitten by a group of 30 mosquitoes for 5 min at 28 °C. After this time, the rats were transferred to a second group of 30 mosquitoes (infected with the same parasites as the first group of mosquitoes) that also fed on them for 5 min. By visual inspection, all of the mosquitoes were determined to have taken a blood meal. Therefore, on average, each rat was infected through the bite of about 10 mosquitoes for 10 min. Parasitemia of infected animals was checked daily, beginning 72 h postinfection, by a Giemsa-stained blood smear. Detection of Infectivity in Vivo Using Real Time PCR—The in vivo infectivity of wild type and KO sporozoites in the liver was determined as follows. Rats were infected by mosquito bite as described earlier or through intravenous injection of 10,000 sporozoites of each parasite into groups of five young SD rats, respectively. The parasite load within each mouse liver was determined 42 h postinfection by real time PCR (17Bruna-Romero O. Hafalla J.C. Gonzalez-Aseguinolaza G. Sano G. Tsuji M. Zavala F. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1499-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The primers used for amplification of P. berghei 18 S rRNA were 5′-AAGCATTAAATAAAGCGAATACATCCTTAC and 5′-GGAGATTGGTTTTGACGTTTATGT. Determination of Cell Traversal Activity in Vitro—The ability of KO and wild type (WT) sporozoites to cross cell layers was determined as described previously (6Mota M.M. Pradel G. Vanderberg J.P. Hafalla J.C. Frevert U. Nussenzweig R.S. Nussenzweig V. Rodriguez A. Science. 2001; 291: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDCK cells were cultivated in 3-μm pore diameter Transwell filters (Costar) for 3 days until they formed a continuous monolayer. Coverslips with 2 × 105 HepG2 cells were placed underneath the filters in the lower chamber. Sporozoites were added to the MDCK. HepG2 cells were incubated for 48 h before fixation, staining, and quantification of EEFs using an anti-EEF monoclonal antibody that recognizes parasite heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) (18Tsuji M. Mattei D. Nussenzweig R.S. Eichinger D. Zavala F. Parasitol. Res. 1994; 80: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The number of EEFs formed is expressed as a percentage of EEFs formed by WT sporozoites. Identification of the P. berghei PL Gene—Pb PL (previously termed UIS10) was identified in a subtractive hybridization screen for genes expressed preferentially in P. berghei salivary gland sporozoites (7Matuschewski K. Ross J. Brown S.M. Kaiser K. Nussenzweig V. Kappe S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41948-41953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Such genes are expected to be important for invasion of the mammalian host, since their expression is up-regulated in the highly infectious salivary gland sporozoites but not in the noninfectious midgut sporozoites. BLAST homology searches with Pb PL of PlasmoDB and the Malaria Genome Project (available on the World Wide Web at www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/P_berghei/) revealed homologs in Plasmodium yoelii, a primate parasite Plasmodium knowlesi, and the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Fig. 1A). A search of www.toxoDB.org identified a partial homologous sequence in Toxoplasma gondii (TGG_994339). A search of the GenBank™ nonredundant data base revealed that the Plasmodium PL is most similar to mammalian LCAT, a member of the PLA2 family of serine lipases. Pb PL encodes a protein of 755 amino acids with a predicted signal sequence. The carboxyl terminus of Pb PL (amino acids 331–755) is 32% identical and 55% similar to human LCAT (Fig. 1A). The region of identity includes the GXSXG motif that is found in all serine lipases and the catalytic triad of a serine, histidine, and aspartate that is found in phospholipases such as LCAT (19Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In mammals, LCAT is a serum enzyme that catalyzes a two-step reaction in which it first acts as a lipase to hydrolyze a fatty acid from the sn-2-position of PC and then transfers it to a cholesterol moiety to form a cholesterol ester. In contrast to the carboxyl terminus, the amino terminus of Pb PL (amino acids 1–330) is not homologous to any other protein in the data base. In fact, even in various Plasmodium species, there is much less conservation among the amino termini compared with the carboxyl termini (Fig. 1). Pb PL Is Expressed on the Surface of Sporozoites—Expression and subcellular localization of Pb PL was investigated using antiserum directed against the carboxyl terminus of Pb PL. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy shows that Pb PL is expressed in salivary gland sporozoites (Fig. 2A). Subsequent cryoimmunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that Pb PL is present on the surface of sporozoites (Fig. 2B), consistent with the presence of a secretory signal peptide. This localization is absent in Pb PL knock-out (see below) sporozoites (Fig. 2B) and sporozoites from the mosquito midgut and asexual stage parasites (data not shown). Heterologously Expressed Pb PL Has Phospholipase and Membrane Lytic Activity in Vitro—The conservation of the GXSXG motif and the SDH catalytic triad and similarity with LCAT suggested that Plasmodium PL may have a phospholipase A2-like activity. In order to test this hypothesis, we expressed Pb PL in a baculovirus expression system. Supernatant from tissue culture cells infected with the Pb PL baculovirus was tested for activity in an assay using labeled PC as substrate. As a positive control, we used purified, recombinant human LCAT (a kind gift from Dr. John S. Parks), which hydrolyzed ∼43.5% of free fatty acid in 1 h, producing a specific activity of 2.25 nmol of free fatty acid hydrolyzed/h/μg (data not shown), which is in close agreement with values reported previously (20Wang J. Gebre A.K. Anderson R.A. Parks J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 280-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Heterologously expressed Pb PL hydrolyzes about 5% of fatty acid in 3 h, demonstrating phospholipase activity of about 3.6 nmol of free fatty acid hydrolyzed/h/ml (Fig. 3A) in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Pb PL activity appears to be calcium-independent, since it is unaffected by the presence of the Ca2+ chelator, EGTA, in the medium (data not shown). As a negative control, we used supernatant from cells infected with baculovirus expressing the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor (14Hu J. Liu J. Ghirlando R. Saltiel A.R. Hubbard S.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1379-1389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which shows minimal lipase activity. The product of PC lysis, lyso-PC, possesses membrane lytic activity (21Bierbaum T.J. Bouma S.R. Huestis W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 555: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a hemolytic assay to test whether Pb PL can disrupt cell membranes. As shown in Fig. 4, heterologously produced Pb PL leads to hemolysis (Fig. 4A) in a concentration-dependent (Fig. 4B) and time-dependent manner (Fig. 4C), whereas the control supernatant shows little hemolysis, indicating that Pb PL can act as a phospholipase and cause lysis of cell membranes. Disruption and Modification of the Pb PL Locus—To study the function of Pb PL in vivo, we created two cloned lines of transgenic parasites. The first was a null mutant (KO) in which the Pb PL ORF was disrupted through the insertion of a dihydrofolate reductase/thymidylate synthase gene cassette (Fig. 5A). In the null mutant, gene disruption was verified using Southern hybridization of BamHI and SphI-digested genomic DNA, using the Pb PL ORF as probe. As expected, the Pb PL probe gave rise to a 2.5-kb band in the WT population but a 0.5-kb band in the KO line (Fig. 5B). To confirm the loss of Pb PL expression, we reverse transcribed first strand cDNA from Pb PL KO sporozoites and used it as template for amplification of Pb PL message. The lack of a product indicates the absence of Pb PL RNA (Fig. 5C). As a control for the integrity of the cDNA template, we used it to amplify a product from another sporozoite gene, the CS gene. The loss of protein expression was confirmed by a loss of staining in indirect immunofluorescence and cryoimmuno-EM in KO sporozoites as compared with wild type ones (Fig. 2A). In the second mutant line (Mut), the putative catalytic site was mutated (S495A, D700A, and H728A) through the insertion of a mutant Pb PL gene into the wild type genomic locus (Fig. 6A). The generation of the mutant line was verified through Southern hybridization analysis of NsiI and XbaI-digested genomic DNA. The probe (Pb PL ORF) produced a single 2.9-kb band in WT and two bands (6.9 and 2.5 kb) in the Mut line (Fig. 6B). The Mut line was confirmed to have Pb PL message through gene-specific PCR amplification using reverse transcribed cDNA from Pb PL Mut sporozoites as template (Fig. 6C). Mut sporozoites displayed normal expression of Pb PL (Fig. 6D). Pb PL KO and Mut Sporozoites Have Reduced Infectivity— Asexual stages of Pb PL KO and Mut parasites are viable, morphologically indistinguishable, and developmentally similar in to wild type parasites. Sporozoites from KO and Mut parasites formed in oocysts and invaded mosquito salivary glands in numbers similar to WT. They also displayed normal gliding motility. To investigate the effects of the KO on the development of EEFs, we infected a human hepatocyte cell line, HepG2, with equal numbers of KO and WT sporozoites. KO parasites developed into EEFs that were similar in number and gross morphology to WT EEFs (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that KO sporozoites undergo normal development in the hepatocytes. To test the infectivity of KO parasites to the mammalian host, we infected groups of rats with sporozoites via either intravenous injection or bites of mosquitoes that were equally infected with either wild type or KO parasites. When infected by bite, the KO parasites were detected in blood 1 day later than WT parasites (Fig. 7A). Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments. In contrast to a bite infection, there was no difference in the prepatent period of KO and WT parasites when the rats were infected by intravenous injection. Identical results were obtained for the Mut line, indicating that the phenotypic effect of the KO line is a result of the loss of enzymatic activity of Pb PL. To further quantify the difference in infectivity in the KO and WT parasites after a bite infection, we used real time PCR to measure parasite load in the liver by determining the levels of the parasite-specific 18 S rRNA (17Bruna-Romero O. Hafalla J.C. Gonzalez-Aseguinolaza G. Sano G. Tsuji M. Zavala F. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1499-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In mice infected with KO sporozoites, there was a decrease of ∼90% in parasite load in the liver, compared with mice infected with WT sporozoites (Fig. 7B). The parasite loads in the liver were not significantly different when the animals were infected through an intravenous injection (Fig. 7C). This is in good agreement with the lack of difference in prepatent periods of blood stage infections. Pb PL KO Sporozoites Have Reduced Ability to Traverse Cells—We hypothesized that the decrease in liver infectivity and increase in prepatent period of the KO parasites, infected through mosquito bite, was most likely a result of impairment in the ability of sporozoites to reach the liver. In order to test the migratory ability of KO sporozoites, we used an assay in which sporozoites have to traverse an epithelial cell barrier formed by a confluent monolayer of Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. MDCK cells are plated in the top chamber of a Transwell filter system, whereas HepG2 cells are plated in the bottom chamber (6Mota M.M. Pradel G. Vanderberg J.P. Hafalla J.C. Frevert U. Nussenzweig R.S. Nussenzweig V. Rodriguez A. Science. 2001; 291: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Sporozoites are then added to the top chamber. Since confluent MDCK cells form very tight intercellular junctions, the number of EEFs formed in the HepG2 cell layer is proportional to the numbers of sporozoites that are able to traverse through the MDCK cell layer and is a reflection of the ability of sporozoites to cross cell barriers. As shown in Fig. 8A, KO sporozoites formed about 90% fewer EEFs compared with wild type sporozoites, suggesting that they are impaired in their ability to traverse cell layers. The process of infection by Plasmodium sporozoites is poorly understood. Imaging of live sporozoites deposited after a mosquito bite (3Vanderberg J.P. Frevert U. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and other experimental approaches (1Ponnudurai T. Lensen A.H. van Gemert G.J. Bolmer M.G. Meuwissen J.H. Trans. R. Soc. Trop.

Hyg. 1997; 57: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) reveal that a majority of parasites are placed in the dermal tissue or in a pool of blood that forms while mosquitoes probe the skin vasculature. From there, the sporozoites have to make their way into blood vessels, a process that takes at least 30 min and requires the passage of parasites through skin cells. In this paper, we present evidence that Pb PL plays an important role in this migration of sporozoites from the skin to the bloodstream. We hypothesize that Pb PL acts as a phospholipase on the surface of sporozoites that hydrolyzes PC (and possibly other phospholipids) present in host cell membranes and thus wounds the cell membrane and allows access into the cell to the migrating sporozoite. Pb PL action facilitates the passage of sporozoites through cells and enables Plasmodium infection in mammalian hosts. This conclusion is based on genetic and biochemical lines of evidence. Disruption of the open reading frame or mutations in the catalytic site of the protein lead to a profound decrease in parasite infectivity when the parasites are delivered to the skin through mosquito bite. This is evidenced both by a sharp decrease in liver infection and an increase in prepatent period. The phenotype is most likely due to a defect in transmigration, which is observed, in vitro, by the decrease in the number of EEFs formed when Pb PL KO sporozoites, compared with wild type, have to cross epithelial cell layers. Inability to damage cell membranes and the resulting impairment in traversing cells is the most likely cause of the significant decrease in liver infection and the delay in the prepatent period of blood infection of Pb PL KO parasites. Pb PL has lipase and membrane lytic activity. Given the sequence homology to LCAT in its carboxyl terminus, it is likely that Pb PL belongs to the PLA2 superfamily of phospholipases. Phosphatidylcholine is the favored substrate of phospholipases such as LCAT and is also the major phospholipid in mammalian cell membranes. Its hydrolysis by PLA2 results in the formation of lysophosphatidylcholine, which causes membrane lysis (21Bierbaum T.J. Bouma S.R. Huestis W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 555: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or changes membrane fluidity. This conclusion is supported by the observation that Pb PL makes membranes more fragile, as demonstrated by its hemolytic activity. The presence of Pb PL homologs in various Plasmodium species suggests that its function is conserved. Pb PL contains a signal sequence at its amino terminus. Although the mechanisms that anchor Pb PL to the sporozoite surface are unknown, Pb PL, similar to other lipases, contains hydrophobic regions, which could interact with lipid bilayers. The amino-terminal portion of Pb PL does not resemble any other protein in the data base. In fact, the amino termini of phospholipase molecules from various Plasmodium species show much less homology to one another compared with the highly conserved carboxyl termini. It is possible that they serve as prosequences that are proteolytically cleaved during protein processing. Membrane lytic activity has been observed in the pathogenesis of many microbial infections. In bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, secreted lipolytic lipases are important virulence factors. Strains expressing the enzymes have greater cytotoxic effects and disseminate faster in host tissue as compared with strains without such lipases (22Allewelt M. Coleman F.T. Grout M. Priebe G.P. Pier G.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3998-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). One such lipase, PLA2, encoded by ExoU, has membrane lytic and cytotoxic effects (23Sato H. Frank D.W. Hillard C.J. Feix J.B. Pankhaniya R.R. Moriyama K. Finck-Barbancon V. Buchaklian A. Lei M. Long R.M. Wiener-Kronish J. Sawa T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 41326-41332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In Helicobacter pylori, a mutant disrupted in the gene encoding PLA2 has decreased hemolytic activity and is impaired in the colonization of the gastric mucosa (25Dorrell N. Martino M.C. Stabler R.A.

In protozoa, such as Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum, and T. gondii, cytotoxic and hemolytic effects have been associated with phospholipase activity. In E. histolytica, loss of virulence is associated with a decrease in PLA2 activity (26Gonzalez-Garza M.T. Castro-Garza J. Cruz-Vega D.E. Vargas-Villarreal J. Carranza-Rosales P. Mata-Cardenas B.D. Siller-Campos L. Said-Fernandez S. Exp. Parasitol. 2000; 96: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In C. parvum (27Pollok R.C. McDonald V. Kelly P. Farthing M.J. Parasitol.

Bessieres M.H. Guy S. Seguela J.P. Chap H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 1137-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a phospholipase might be involved in host cell invasion. Once in the bloodstream, the sporozoites have to traverse through Kupffer cells present in the liver sinusoidal layer in order to infect hepatocytes (4Pradel G. Frevert U. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1154-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Ishino T. Yano K. Chinzei Y. Yuda M. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 77-84Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, the Pb PL knock-out and mutant parasites are not defective when delivered by intravenous injection, indicating that Pb PL activity is not required to penetrate Kupffer cells. There are two possible explanations for this paradox. One is that Kupffer cell invasion occurs via the formation of a parasitophorous vacuole. Using confocal and electron microscopy, previous studies have found sporozoites encapsulated in a vacuolar membrane, within the Kupffer cell cytoplasm (4Pradel G. Frevert U. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1154-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This vacuole is nonacidic in nature and allows sporozoite to survive intact for several hours. Thus, entry of sporozoites into Kupffer cells does not require membrane disruption, and Pb PL would not be expected to play a major role in liver infection. The second possibility is that cell traversal in the liver utilizes molecules and mechanisms other than Pb PL. A recent report implicates a novel protein, SPECT (sporozoite microneme protein essential for cell traversal) in the passage of the liver sinusoidal cell layer by sporozoites (31Ishino T. Yano K. Chinzei Y. Yuda M. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 77-84Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). SPECT is present in sporozoite micronemes, and spect-disrupted sporozoites are impaired in ability to passage through cells. However, the mechanism of SPECT action is unknown. It is likely that sporozoite entry and exit from cells may well result from the combinatorial action of several molecules acting in concert or succession. Different parasite molecules may be required for the invasion of various target host cells. Further studies are required to unravel the process of cell wounding by sporozoites. In addition, another intriguing question is the nature of the signals and molecular mechanisms that lead the parasite to switch from the “cell wounding” strategy used to migrate through host tissues to the “vacuole formation” strategy that leads to the formation of the intracellular parasitophorous vacuole, where sporozoites finally transform into EEFs within hepatocytes.

Nuclear hormone receptors comprise a superfamily of transcription factors that is usually activated by small lipophilic ligands (1Committee Nuclear Receptor Nomenclature Cell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). These receptors bind to specific cis-acting elements in their target genes influencing development, differentiation, and physiological homeostasis (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P.

The nuclear receptor superfamily can be divided into three categories. The first category includes the classical steroid hormone receptors activated by high affinity ligands. The second group includes true orphan receptors for which no physiological ligand has been discovered. The third category corresponds to receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, liver X receptors, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), 1The abbreviations used are: FXR, farnesoid X receptor; BSEP, bile salt export pump; CDCA, 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanic acid; C3, complement C3; ASP, acylation stimulating protein; WAT, white adipocyte tissue; RT, reverse transcription; SHP, small heterodimer partner; IBABP, ileal bile acid-binding protein; 6FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; TAMRA, carboxytetramethylrhodamine; FXRE, farnesoid X receptor element; LDLR, low density lipoprotein receptor.1The abbreviations used are: FXR, farnesoid X receptor; BSEP, bile salt export pump; CDCA, 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanic acid; C3, complement C3; ASP, acylation stimulating protein; WAT, white adipocyte tissue; RT, reverse transcription; SHP, small heterodimer partner; IBABP, ileal bile acid-binding protein; 6FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; TAMRA, carboxytetramethylrhodamine; FXRE, farnesoid X receptor element; LDLR, low density lipoprotein receptor. steroid xenobiotic receptor/pregnane X receptor, and constitutive androstane receptor. These receptors are activated by dietary low-affinity ligands and have recently been defined as metabolic sensors (3Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). FXR (NR1H4) is a nuclear receptor that is bound and activated by specific bile acids at physiological concentrations (4Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V.

FXR controls bile acid concentrations in the liver by inhibiting the expression of CYP7A1 encoding cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, and Na(+)/taurocholate cotransporting peptide, a transporter responsible for bile acid uptake. Additionally, FXR induces the expression of the bile salt export pump (BSEP). Together these changes in gene expression result in a net efflux of bile acids from the hepatocyte into bile (7Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Suchy F.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, FXR controls the accumulation of toxic bile acids by inducing bile acid-amino acid conjugation and the conversion of hydrophobic bile acids into more hydrophilic less toxic glucuronide derivates (10Pircher P.C. Kitto J.L. Petrowski M.L. Tangirala R.K. Bischoff E.D. Schulman I.G. Westin S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27703-27711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Barbier O.

The recent identification of bile acids as physiological ligands for FXR may explain studies performed more than 20 years ago in which chenodeoxycholate (3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanic acid) (CDCA) given to patients with gallstones lowered plasma triglycerides (12Bateson M.C. Maclean D. Evans J.R. Bouchier I.A. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1978; 5: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Iser J.H. Sali A. Drugs. 1981; 21: 90-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, bile acid-binding resins are known to induce the production of very low density lipoprotein triglycerides underscoring the importance of bile acids in maintaining triglyceride homeostasis (14Angelin B. Einarsson K. Hellstrom K. Leijd B. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1017-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The demonstration that plasma triglycerides are elevated in FXR knock-out mice and that a synthetic FXR agonist causes a 50% reduction in triglycerides in rats clearly establish a role for FXR in lipid metabolism (15Sinal C.J.

Furthermore, the induction of apolipoprotein CII and the simultaneous repression of apolipoprotein CIII in the liver by FXR ligands represent an important pathway for the clearance of plasma triglycerides (18Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Sinal C.J. Jones S.A. Laffitte B.A. Reue K. Gonzalez F.J. Willson T.M. Edwards P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 19Claudel T. Inoue Y.

Nevertheless, the expression of apoCII and apoCIII is not significantly altered in FXR knock-out mice, suggesting that FXR may utilize multiple mechanisms to regulate plasma triglyceride levels. For instance, recent evidence suggests that FXR can regulate fattyacid synthesis through an indirect mechanism involving SHP, liver X receptor, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1C (20Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Wang L. Moschetta A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Heyman R.A. Moore D.D. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1408-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Similarly, the identification of FGF19, a known regulator of metabolic rate, as an FXR target gene suggests that FXR may indirectly regulate lipid metabolism by controlling the expression of secreted factors (21Holt J.A. Luo G. Billin A.N. Bisi J. McNeill Y.Y. Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M. Wang da Y. Mansfield T.A. Kliewer S.A. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1581-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lipids in the form of polyunsaturated fatty acids may in fact be endogenous FXR ligands and thus may act to limit their own synthesis (22Zhao A. Yu J. Lew J.L. Huang L. Wright S.D. Cui J. DNA Cell Biol. 2004; 23: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Here we report that complement C3 (C3) and fgf15, the mouse ortholog of FGF19 (23Wright T.J. Ladher R. McWhirter J. Murre C. Schoenwolf G.C. Mansour S.L. Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), are direct FXR target genes. C3 in addition to its role in innate immunity is a precursor for acylation stimulating protein (ASP) (24Cianflone K. Xia Z. Chen L.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Produced by adipocytes in response to a fat-containing meal, ASP acts in a paracrine fashion to increase fatty acid uptake and triglyceride synthesis. The identification of C3 as an FXR target gene suggests a previously unknown link between FXR and complement activation and further supports a described previously link among complement activation, lipid metabolism, and atherosclerosis. Cell Cultures—Fao (a designated rat hepatoma cell derived from rat H4IIE cells), Caco-2, and CV-1 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained according to its depository. Cells were treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or the following FXR ligands: 100 μm 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanic acid (CDCA) and 1 μm 3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4-(3′-carboxy-2-chloro-stilben-4-yl)oxymethyl-5-isopropyl-isoxazole (GW4064) (17Maloney P.R.

RNA Isolation and mRNA Quantitation—Total RNA was isolated from rat and mouse liver, intestinal mucosa, mouse white adipocyte tissue (WAT), Fao, and Caco-2 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and further purified by using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For Northern analysis, total RNA (20 μg) was resolved on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and cross-linked to the membrane with UV-light. cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime II labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized using the Rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences), washed according to the manufacturer, and quantified using a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). TaqMan Primers and Probes—Oligonucleotide primers and the probes for mouse complement C3, fgf15, SHP, IBABP, FXR, rat SHP and IBABP and human FGF19 were designed using the Primer Express program and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc.

The 850-base pair amplicon was radiolabeled and used as a probe for Northern analysis. Mouse cDNA for fgf15 was PCR-amplified from reverse-transcribed mouse intestinal mucosa mRNA using primers 5′-ATGGCGAGAAAGTGGAACGGGC-3′ and 5′-TTTCT-GGAAGCTGGGACTC-3′ corresponding to nucleotides 1– 653 of the coding sequence. The 653-base pair amplicon was radiolabeled and used as a probe for Northern analysis. The SHP promoter contains 2 kb of the human promoter and was a gift from Dr. David Moore (Baylor College of Medicine). Human BSEP promoter contains 1.5-kb upstream sequences cloned in pGL3b with primers as described previously (7Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Suchy F.J. J. Biol.

A fragment spanning ∼500 base pairs of promoter and 5′-flanking sequence of C3 gene was PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA using primers 5′-TTCCCCTCCCTCAGCATGGA-3′ and 5′-ACAGAGGGAGAGGATGGGGAGGAGT-3′ and cloned into HindIII-XhoI sites of pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Point mutation of the FXRE (IR-1) sequence in the C3 gene was done using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene with the antisense primer (5′-GGGAACA-TGCCCTCAAATTACTCATTCCATGGACATGTTGG-3′) and a sense primer (5′-CCAACATGTCCATGGAATGAGTAATTTGAGGGCATGT-TCCC-3′) (mutated bases are indicated in boldface) in a PCR according to the manufacturer's directions. All of the oligonucleotides primers were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. The sequences of all of the constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—CV-1 cells were transfected using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). 30 ng of reporter plasmid, 10 ng of pCMX-hFXR, 10 ng of pCMX-hRXRα, and 10 ng of pCMV-β-galactosidase and 0.28 μl of FuGENE 6 were used in a final volume of 10 μl. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the mixture was added to cells in 96-well plates and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. The cells were then treated with medium containing 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum and vehicle (Me2SO) or one of the following ligands: 100 μm CDCA or 1 μm GW4064. After 20 h, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. The normalized luciferase units were determined by dividing the luciferase activity by the β-galactosidase activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Core sequences of C3 and fgf15 IR-1s are shown in Fig. 2A. Annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase II. hFXR and hRXRα were synthesized from pCMX-FXR and pCMX-RXRα expression vectors using the TnT T7 Coupled reticulocyte system (Promega, Madison WI). Binding reactions contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 75 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 15% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 3 μl each of synthesized receptor protein, and 0.05 pmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide. Competitor oligonucleotides were added at a 2.5–100-fold molar excess. The oligonucleotides used as follows: for the C3 IR-1, 5′-CACAAGCTTCCCTCAGGTTACTCACCCCATGGA-3′; for mouse fgf15 IR-1, 5′-AGCTTCTGCAGTTCAATGACCTCTG-3′; and for rat fgf15 IR-1, 5′-AGCTTCTGCAGGTCAGTGACCTCGG-3′ (only one strand is shown, and the IR-1 is indicated in boldface). The oligonucleotides for human SHP and BSEP IR-1s were as described previously (1Committee Nuclear Receptor Nomenclature Cell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 2Mangelsdorf D.J.

Western Blots—Plasma from rats (1 μg) was denatured by boiling in SDS-loading dye and run on an SDS-acrylamide gel, and proteins were blotted to a nylon membrane. The blot was incubated with a polyclonal antibody made against the C3a protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and then developed using a secondary antibody conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase. Animal Studies—Animal care and experiments were conducted according to National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male F344/NHsd rats and male C57BL/6 mice were fed ad libitum and were kept under standard light/dark cycle. The GW4064 compound was suspended in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose vehicle for a dosing volume of 1 ml for rats and 0.1 ml for mice. Animals were given a single dose with a feeding needle to give a final concentration of 100 mg/kg. The animals were sacrificed 8 h following the dose, and liver, small intestinal, and epididymal fat tissues were excised. The intestinal mucosa scraped from the lower 30% small intestine were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at –80 °C until RNA preparation. Liver and intestinal mucosa collected from FXR null mice (3Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar) back-crossed more than four generations into C57BL/6 mice, and age-matched wild type C57BL/6 mice was a kind gift from Dr. David Moore. Induction of Complement C3 and FGF19 by FXR Agonists—An analysis of microarray data from rat primary hepatocytes indicates that the gene encoding C3 is induced by both natural (CDCA) and synthetic FXR (GW4064) agonists (10Pircher P.C. Kitto J.L. Petrowski M.L. Tangirala R.K. Bischoff E.D. Schulman I.G. Westin S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27703-27711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The induction of C3 was confirmed by Northern analysis in Fao, a rat hepatoma cell line (Fig. 1A), and in Caco-2, a human colorectal adenocarcinoma expressing FXR (Fig. 1B). The regulation of C3 in intestinal cells was unexpected, because the liver is considered the predominant site of expression. Therefore, we examined whether FGF19, another secreted factor previously identified to be a FXR target gene in hepatocytes (21Holt J.A. Luo G. Billin A.N. Bisi J. McNeill Y.Y. Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M. Wang da Y. Mansfield T.A. Kliewer S.A. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1581-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), is also regulated in Caco-2 cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, FGF19 is significantly induced by FXR ligands in these cells, suggesting that FXR activity in the intestine may influence lipid metabolism by promoting the synthesis and secretion of these factors. Identification of FXREs in Human Complement C3 and Rodent fgf15 Genes—The strong induction of C3 mRNA by GW4064 and CDCA suggests that this gene is a direct target of FXR activation. A search for FXR-responsive elements similar to an inverted repeat of the consensus sequence AGGTCA spaced by one nucleotide (IR-1) revealed a potential element located ∼150 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site in the human C3 gene (Fig. 2A). This IR-1 sequence, as well as the location, is conserved in rat and mouse C3 genes. fgf15 has been suggested to be the mouse ortholog of human FGF19 despite the relatively low homology (51% amino acid identity). Nonetheless, rat and mouse fgf15 contain IR-1 sites in intron 2, a similar location that was reported for human FGF19 (Fig. 2A). To demonstrate that FXR-RXR heterodimers directly bind the IR-1s identified in the proximal human C3 and in the rodent fgf15 genes, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed. Radiolabeled DNA fragments corresponding to the putative IR-1s from the human C3 and fgf15 (Fig. 2A) genes were prepared and examined for ability to bind FXR-RXR heterodimers. When added together, a significant FXR-RXR complex is formed on the C3 and fgf15 IR-1s that is not detected with either receptor alone. Additionally, binding is competed by an excess of their respective unlabeled IR-1 oligonucleotides (Fig. 2B). More detailed binding affinity studies revealed that FXR-RXR heterodimers bind to the SHP IR-1 with ∼4 –5-fold higher affinity compared with the C3 IR-1 as evidenced by a lower IC50 value of the SHP IR-1 competing for binding to the C3 IR-1 (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, FXR-RXR binding affinities are similar on the IR-1s for C3 and BSEP (Fig. 2, D and E). Chimeric human C3-luciferase reporter gene constructs were made, and the ability of FXR to transactivate luciferase expression was tested by transient transfections into CV-1 cells. The 450-base pair upstream sequences from the human C3 gene confer FXR responsiveness indicated by the increase in luciferase activity when cells are treated with CDCA and GW4064 ligands in the presence of co-transfected FXR and RXR (Fig. 3A). The maximal transcriptional activity mediated by FXR appears equal when comparing C3 to the known FXR target genes BSEP and SHP despite a higher FXR-RXR binding affinity on the SHP IR-1. However, the fold induction of the C3 promoter by FXR ligands is lower compared with the fold activation of BSEP and SHP because of higher basal activity of the C3 promoter. Mutation of the putative FXRE abolishes FXR activity but not the basal activity of the C3 promoter (Fig. 3B). Regulation of Complement C3 and fgf15 Levels in Vivo—To determine whether FXR regulates C3 expression in vivo, C3 mRNA levels were compared in FXR+/+ and FXR–/– mice. In the intestine, deletion of FXR resulted in decreased levels of C3 mRNA (Fig. 4A). Although there is a trend for reduced levels of C3 mRNA in the liver of FXR–/– mice, expression levels were not significantly different from FXR+/+ mice (Fig. 4B). The relatively high levels of C3 expression in the liver, >100 times the level in the intestine, may make it difficult to detect an effect of deleting FXR. In C57Bl/6 mice treated with a single dose of GW4064, an ∼2-fold induction of C3 mRNA was observed in intestinal mucosa, whereas a small but significant induction was again observed in the liver of these animals (Fig. 4, C and D). The basal expression of C3 mRNA in WAT, the target tissue for ASP (the cleaved product of C3), was also high compared with the intestine, but a significant increase in C3 mRNA expression was seen in response to GW4064 (Fig. 4E). The relatively low expression level of FXR mRNA in WAT compared with the liver and ileum may account for the modest increase in this tissue (Fig. 4F). Thus, a combination of genetic deletion and pharmacological activation of FXR identifies C3 as a target gene in vivo. Although expression levels did not differ significantly between FXR+/+ and FXR–/– mice (data not shown), fgf15 mRNA levels were dramatically increased by GW4064 in the intestine (Fig. 4G). Even though mouse fgf15 was suggested to be the ortholog of FGF19, it was not expressed in the liver (data not shown). The two established target genes SHP and IBABP were induced in liver and intestine, respectively, confirming significant exposure of GW4064 in these tissues (Fig. 4, H and I). Northern analysis also shows a robust induction of C3 and fgf15 mRNA expression in the intestine of rats that was given a single dose of GW4064 (Fig. 5A). The major source of C3 in plasma is traditionally believed to be the liver, although secretion from other tissues has been implicated (25Barnum S.R. Volanakis J.E. Year Immunol. 1989; 6: 208-228PubMed Google Scholar). As was seen in mice, rat liver C3 levels were only modestly increased by an FXR ligand, presumably because of already high basal mRNA expression levels in this tissue (data not shown). Regardless of the source of C3, plasma levels were dramatically increased in rats treated with the FXR agonist GW4064 (Fig. 5B). As seen in mice, GW4064 increased SHP and IBABP mRNA levels in the liver and intestine, respectively (Fig. 5, C and D). Taken together, these data suggest that regulation of C3 in the intestine may indirectly influence lipid metabolism at other peripheral sites. In this study, we have identified complement C3 as a novel FXR target gene. Our results showed that C3 is induced in cell lines of hepatic and intestinal origin and that regulation of C3 by FXR occurs predominantly in the small intestine in vivo. Regulation of C3 was also observed in WAT; however, the observation that FXR mRNA levels are 50 –100-fold less in this tissue relative to liver and intestine (Fig. 4F) (26Zhang Y. Kast-Woelbern H.R. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 104-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) may contribute to the relatively modest change seen with GW4064. High basal levels of hepatic and adipocyte C3 expression, perhaps resulting from tissue specific factors and/or endogenous fatty acid-derived FXR ligands (22Zhao A. Yu J. Lew J.L. Huang L. Wright S.D. Cui J. DNA Cell Biol. 2004; 23: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), may also make it difficult to detect an effect of synthetic ligands in these tissues. We showed that the human and rodent C3 genes contain FXREs reminiscent of a an IR-1 sequence, that FXR-RXR heterodimers bind to this sequence, and that mutating the binding site abolishes FXR responsiveness of a C3 promoter-reporter construct. Likewise, the genes encoding mouse and rat fgf15 hold IR-1 elements at an almost identical position as the human FGF19 gene. Mice disrupted of FXR showed decreased expression of C3 in the intestine, confirming the importance of this nuclear receptor for regulation of C3. Finally, C3 and fgf15 mRNA levels were increased in response to the FXR agonist GW4064 in intestinal mucosa of mice and rats and C3 protein levels were increased in plasma of rats. The antibody to C3 used in these studies cannot unambiguously detect mouse C3; therefore, additional studies will be needed to determine whether FXR agonists increase plasma C3 levels in mice and whether FGF15 is secreted into plasma. Taken together, our results establish that FXR directly regulates the genes encoding for C3 and fgf15 and also point to an important function of the intestine as a site of expression. Furthermore, the induction of human FGF19 in the colon-derived Caco-2 cell line similarly suggests the intestine as a site of expression for this factor. The question arising from these studies is whether activation of target genes and ultimately secretion of factors from the intestine play a role in the triglyceride-lowering activity of FXR ligands. FGF19 transgenic mice displayed increased metabolic rate and decreased adiposity (27Tomlinson E. Fu L. John L. Hultgren B. Huang X. Renz M. Stephan J.P. Tsai S.P. Powell-Braxton L. French D. Stewart T.A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1741-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Importantly, although a muscle specific promoter (myosin light chain) was used to create the FGF19 transgenic animals, the major target tissue for FGF19 is believed to be the liver. This finding suggests that, in the transgenic mice, FGF19 is produced in muscle and secreted to its target tissue. The mouse counterpart of FGF19, fgf15, was induced by FXR in the intestine rather than in the liver. Although further studies are needed to establish whether fgf15 exerts similar functions as FGF19, our studies suggest that, in addition to C3, FXR regulates production of fgf15. Studies have shown that, in adipose tissue, C3 is converted to C3a by the action of factors B and D (adipsin) and subsequently is des-arginated by carboxypeptidase N to yield C3adesArg, which is identical to ASP. ASP acts in a paracrine fashion to increase free fatty acid uptake and triglyceride synthesis in the adipocyte (24Cianflone K. Xia Z. Chen L.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Although C3 mRNA and protein levels are robustly increased by FXR, we found no evidence of an increase in plasma ASP after administration of the FXR ligand GW4064 in either mice or rats. The reason for this discrepancy may be that ASP is produced by cleavage of C3 locally in the adipose tissue, making it difficult to detect an increase in plasma ASP. Furthermore, in humans, the concentration of ASP in plasma is over 200-fold less than C3 (24Cianflone K. Xia Z. Chen L.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Apparently, only a relatively small fraction of C3 is converted to ASP in circulation and may be difficult to detect. On the same note, whereas the primary site of ASP production is believed to be in adipose tissue, the source of cleaved ASP may be derived from C3 synthesis in other tissues. Although it has traditionally been assumed that the liver is the primary site of synthesis for C3 (28Alper C.A. Johnson A.M. Birtch A.G. Moore F.D. Science. 1969; 163: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), our results show FXR-dependent induction of C3 mRNA predominantly in the small intestine. Although an increase in plasma C3 protein and mRNA does not necessarily reflect the functional activity of ASP, it is tempting to speculate that an up-regulation of C3 expression leads to increased fatty acid uptake in the adipocyte. Hence, the reduction of plasma triglyceride levels by FXR ligands may in part be the consequence of increased fatty acid uptake and triglyceride storage in adipose tissue. Mice lacking C3, thus also deficient in ASP, have delayed postprandial triglyceride clearance that can be normalized by administration of recombinant ASP (29Murray I. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1671-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these mice lack both C3 and ASP, there is no evidence to suggest that intact C3 plays a direct role in lipid metabolism or fat storage. Nevertheless, serum concentrations of C3 have been associated with serum lipid and insulin levels (30Messiha N. Watson R.R. Life Sci. 1989; 44: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 31Boggs R.D. McCumbee W.D. Cobbs S.L. Todd D.G. Kahle E.B. Stewart N.L. Bailey M. Reichenbecher V.E. Obes.

Patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia have elevated serum C3 but not ASP (33Ylitalo K. Pajukanta P. Meri S. Cantor R.M. Mero-Matikainen N. Vakkilainen J. Nuotio I. Taskinen M.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 838-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These patients have, in addition to hyperlipidemia, metabolic abnormalities including prolonged postprandial lipemia with an excess of free fatty acids in serum. Although still controversial, increased C3 levels in familial combined hyperlipidemia may indicate a dysfunctional ASP signaling pathway in these patients. A blunted response due to impaired C3 cleavage and consequently impaired peripheral fatty acid uptake may explain the increased hepatic free fattyacid flux and very low density lipoprotein overproduction in familial combined hyperlipidemia. The influence of complement activation on the development of atherosclerosis has also been explored. It is well known that atherosclerosis is associated with an inflammatory response to the accumulation of subendothelial lipids, and there is evidence that complement activation is involved in atheroma formation (34Niculescu F. Rus H. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Complement components have been identified in the walls of diseased vessels, and mRNAs of complement factors are expressed in atherosclerotic plaques (35Pang A.S. Katz A. Minta J.O. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 1117-1122PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hansson G.K. Holm J. Kral J.G. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. [A]. 1984; 92: 429-435Google Scholar, 37Vlaicu R. Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Cristea A.

Atherosclerosis. 1991; 91: 155-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When C3 deficient mice were crossed with ldlr–/– mice and challenged with high fat diet, a greater lesion size in the ldlr–/–C3–/– compared with ldlr–/–C3–/+ mice was measured (39Buono C. Come C.E. Witztum J.L. Maguire G.F. Connelly P.W. Carroll M. Lichtman A.H. Circulation. 2002; 105: 3025-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). C3-deficient mice crossed with mice deficient in both ldlr and apoe, have a lesion area that is 84% higher compared with apoe–/–ldlr–/– mice (40Persson L. Boren J. Robertson A.K. Wallenius V. Hansson G.K. Pekna M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The C3-deficient mice in an apoe–/–ldlr–/– background also had a more atherogenic lipoprotein profile than controls with elevated serum triglyceride levels and increased very low density lipoprotein triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. These results suggest that complement activation exerts atheroprotective effects through the regulation of lipid metabolism and also suggests that FXR ligands may be useful for the treatment of atherosclerosis. In conclusion, FXR regulates complement component C3, a key factor in the alternative pathway of complement activation and fgf15, the mouse ortholog of human FGF19 through a direct mechanism at the transcriptional level. The activation of C3, a precursor of ASP, and fgf15 in the intestine may have profound effects on lipid metabolism and may in part explain the hypolipidemic effects of FXR ligands. We thank Drs.

Mas37 assembled directly with the TOB core complex. Hence, the biogenesis of Mas37 represents a novel import pathway of mitochondrial proteins. A number of membrane-embedded β-barrel proteins made up from antiparallel β-sheets constitute a distinct group of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins (1Gabriel K. Buchanan S.K. Lithgow T.

Members of this group include Tom40, porin, Mdm10, and Tob55/Sam50. Like all outer membrane proteins, precursors of β-barrel proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and have to be imported into mitochondria. At the mitochondrial surface, they interact initially with the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM complex) and then are transferred to the TOB complex at the outer membrane (3Rapaport D.

Tob55 is essential for viability of yeast cells and promotes the insertion of β-barrel proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane (8Kozjak V. Wiedemann N. Milenkovic D. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E.

Mas37 interacts with Tob55, and its role in the biogenesis of β-barrel proteins is yet undefined (8Kozjak V. Wiedemann N. Milenkovic D. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. J. Biol.

Together with Tob55, Tob38 forms a functional TOB core complex and is essential for the integrity and function of the TOB complex (12Waizenegger T. Habib S.J. Lech M. Mokranjac D. Paschen S.A.

Despite its central role in the biogenesis of mitochondria, the biogenesis of the TOB complex itself has not been resolved so far. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms by which Tob55 and Mas37 are targeted to the mitochondria and assembled into the TOB complex. Our results demonstrate that Tob55 interacts initially with the Tom surface receptors. Its assembly into preexisting TOB complexes is facilitated by the small Tim 1The abbreviations used are: TIM, translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane; IMS, intermembrane space; HA, hemagglutinin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BNGE, blue native gel electrophoresis; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-dio; PK, proteinase K; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase. proteins in the intermembrane space (IMS) and depends on Tob38 and Tob55, components of the TOB complex. In sharp contrast, the initial import steps of the precursor of Mas37 are independent of the TOM complex and seem to be mediated directly by the TOB core complex. Thus, our results suggest a unique mechanism of targeting and assembly of Mas37. Yeast Strains and Growth Methods—Standard genetic techniques were used for growth and manipulation of yeast strains (15Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). The wild-type strains BY4743, YPH499, and 273-10B were used. For construction of Δmas37 mutant strain, the MAS37 gene was deleted by replacement with HIS3 gene cassette. PCR-mediated gene manipulation was used to replace the chromosomal copy of TOB38 by a geneexpressing HA tag after the coding sequence of Tob38. The resulting strain, Tob38HA, grew like the wild-type strain (data not shown). Yeast strains containing temperature-sensitive alleles of tom40 were described previously (16Kassenbrock C.K. Cao W.

Blotting to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes and immunodecoration was according to standard procedures and visualization was by the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Radiolabeled precursor proteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) after in vitro transcription by SP6 polymerase from pGEM4 vectors containing the gene of interest. Import experiments were performed in a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, 2 mm NADH, and 2 mm ATP, pH 7.2. Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis (BNGE)—Mitochondria (50–150 μg) were lysed in 40 μl of buffer containing 1% digitonin, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4. After incubation at 4 °C for 15 min and a clarifying spin (15 min at 20,600 × g), 4 μl of sample buffer (5% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 100 mm bis-Tris, 500 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, pH 7.0) were added, and the mixture was analyzed on a 6–13% gradient blue native gel (3Rapaport D. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Scha ̈gger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). The TOM Machinery Is Dispensable for the Import of Mas37—To analyze the import and assembly pathways of the precursor proteins Tob55 and Mas37, radiolabeled precursors were synthesized in vitro and incubated with mitochondria isolated from yeast cells. As a criterion for correct insertion into the outer membrane, we used a protease accessibility assay. In the case of Tob55, treatment of mitochondria with proteinase K (PK) resulted in the formation of a specific proteolytic fragment of 30 kDa (9Paschen S.A. Waizenegger T. Stan T. Preuss M. Cyrklaff M. Hell K. Rapaport D. Neupert W. Nature. 2003; 426: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This fragment was also observed upon insertion of radiolabeled Tob55 precursor into the outer membrane of isolated mitochondria (Fig. 1A). We observed a second fragment with an apparent molecular mass of ∼20 kDa. These fragments were completely degraded upon solubilization of the mitochondria with the detergent Triton X-100 and were not observed when reticulocyte lysate containing the Tob55 precursor was treated with PK (Fig. 1A). The two fragments are embedded in the outer membrane, and they could not be extracted by alkaline solution (Fig. 1B). Thus, this protection assay can be employed to study the mechanism of insertion of Tob55 into the mitochondrial outer membrane. The intensity of the 30-kDa fragment served in further experiments to quantify membrane insertion of Tob55. To study the association of Mas37 with the mitochondrial outer membrane, we used the observation that treatment of mitochondria with PK results in the formation of two proteolytic fragments (14 and 20 kDa) of Mas37 (10Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Scho ̈nfish B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We first asked whether the TOM complex plays a role in the import of these two precursor proteins. Using the in vitro assays described above, we examined the requirement for the import receptors, Tom20 and Tom70, in the insertion/association pathways of Tob55 and Mas37. Mitochondria isolated from strains lacking either Tom20 or Tom70 were incubated with radiolabeled Tob55, and the amounts of inserted precursor were analyzed. Tob55 was inserted into these mutated mitochondria with a strongly reduced efficiency as compared with wild-type organelles (Fig. 2). In contrast, deletion of the import receptors did not affect the association of Mas37 with mitochondria (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained when the import experiments were performed at 15 °C (not shown). Hence, although the import receptors Tom20 and Tom70 appear to play only a minor role, if any, in the association of Mas37 with the outer membrane, they have a crucial function in the recognition of Tob55 precursor.Fig. 3The association of Mas37 with mitochondria is independent of import receptors. The radiolabeled precursor of Mas37 was incubated at 25 °C for the indicated time periods with mitochondria isolated either from wild-type strain or from strain lacking Tom20 (A) or Tom70 (B). After import, the samples were treated with proteinase K (15 μg/ml), and mitochondria were re-isolated. Inserted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The association of Mas37 was quantified by analyzing the formation of the 14-kDa fragment (10Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Scho ̈nfish B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The amount of precursor protein associated with wild-type mitochondria for the longest time period was set to 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Can the import of the two proteins be competed out by a matrix-destined precursor? To investigate this possibility, a large molar excess of pSu9(1–69)-DHFR, a recombinant preprotein that is known to use the import pore, was added to the import reaction containing the radiolabeled precursors. Similar experiments had shown previously that import of radiolabeled matrix-destined precursors as well as precursors of outer membrane β-barrel proteins was competed out by recombinant pSu9(1–69)-DHFR (3Rapaport D. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 4Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Douglas M.G. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9Paschen S.A. Waizenegger T. Stan T. Preuss M. Cyrklaff M. Hell K. Rapaport D. Neupert W. Nature. 2003; 426: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, the insertion of Tob55 was strongly reduced upon the addition of excess preprotein (Fig. 4A). In contrast, excess recombinant pSu9(1–69)-DHFR did not reduce the association of radiolabeled Mas37 with mitochondria (Fig. 4A). To further investigate the involvement of Tom40 in the import of both precursor proteins, we investigated their import into mitochondria isolated from strains harboring temperature-sensitive alleles of tom40. These strains (tom40-3 and tom40-4) were used previously to study the insertion of porin into the outer membrane. The mutation in the tom40-3 strain did not affect the insertion of porin, whereas those in tom40-4 resulted in lower efficiency of porin insertion into the membrane (Fig. 4B) (4Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Douglas M.G. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The insertion of Tob55 into the Tom40-4 mitochondria was significantly less efficient in comparison to the wild-type mitochondria, whereas no difference was observed with Tom40-3 mitochondria (Fig. 4B). The association of Mas37 with mitochondria from the mutated strains and from wild-type strain was similar (Fig. 4B). Thus, Tom40 does play a role in the insertion of Tob55, whereas the same mutational alterations of Tom40 do not affect the association of Mas37 precursor with mitochondria. The Small Tim Components in the IMS Are Involved in the Assembly of Tob55—The precursor of Tom40 was transferred from the TOM to the TOB complexes via the IMS (21Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfannschmidt S. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Hoppins S.C. Nargang F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12396-12405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal domain of Tom22 protrudes into the IMS, we asked whether this domain plays any role in the insertion of Tob55 precursor molecules. To investigate that question, we analyzed the insertion into mitochondria isolated from a strain expressing Tom22 molecules without this domain (Fig. 5A) (17Moczko M. Bo ̈mer U. Ku ̈brich M. Zufall N. Ho ̈nlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6574-6584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because such a deletion had no effect on the insertion efficiency, we conclude that this domain does not play an important role in the insertion process. We checked whether the small Tim proteins in the IMS (Tim9/10 and Tim8/13 complexes) are involved in the insertion pathway of a precursor of Tob55. We tested the insertion of Tob55 precursor into mitochondria isolated from a strain lacking the Tim8/13 complex and from a strain with the mutated TIM10 allele (Fig. 5, B and C). In both cases we observed an impaired insertion as compared with the wild-type organelles. This reduction is similar to that observed when another β-barrel protein, Tom40, was imported into mitochondria containing the mutated allele of Tim10 (21Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfannschmidt S. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Notably, the effect of the mutations in tim10 on the import of the ADP-ATP carrier protein, a bona fide substrate of the Tim9/10 complex, was much more profound as compared with the moderate effect on the insertion of Tob55 (Fig. 5C). Taken together, both complexes in the IMS, Tim8/13 and Tim9/10, appear to be involved in the assembly of Tob55. To further study the biogenesis of Tob55, its assembly into the TOB complex was analyzed by blue native gel electrophoresis (BNGE). Radiolabeled Tob55 was incubated with mitochondria isolated from either wild type or a strain containing a HA-tagged version of Tob38 (Tob38HA). At the end of the import reactions, the mitochondria were re-isolated, solubilized in buffer containing 1% digitonin, and subjected to BNGE. At short incubation periods, we observed a high molecular mass species of ∼350 kDa (Fig. 6A, I). At longer incubation periods, we observed additional species with lower molecular mass (Fig. 6A, II–IV). The two upper species (Fig. 6A, I and II) contain the Tob55-interacting partner, Tob38, as they migrated higher in Tob38HA mitochondria than in wild-type organelles (Fig. 6A). Further support for the presence of Tob38 in the upper species (Fig. 6A, I) was obtained by antibody shift experiment. Radiolabeled Tob55 was imported into Tob38HA mitochondria. Antibodies against the HA tag were added after solubilization of the mitochondria. This addition resulted in a shift of the upper band to higher molecular masses (Fig. 6B). To obtain further information about the various species observed upon import of radiolabeled Tob55, we decorated the membrane with antibodies against Tob55. Because the radiolabeled Tob55 are in amounts that are too low to be detected by the antibodies, this immunodecoration can be used to analyze the migration of the preexisting Tob55 protein. The endogenously assembled Tob55 migrates in BNGE in 3–4 distinct bands that represent various oligomeric conformations (10Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Scho ̈nfish B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 14Ishikawa D. Yamamoto H. Tamura Y. Moritoh K. Endo T. J.

Guiard B. Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The exact composition and stoichiometry of these oligomeric states are not resolved yet. Nevertheless, the upper and lower bands of the radiolabeled Tob55 (Fig. 6C, I and IV) co-migrate with the upper and lower species of the assembled Tob55 (Fig. 6C). Hence, at least a fraction of the newly imported radiolabeled Tob55 molecules behave like the endogenously assembled Tob55. To obtain further support for the notion that components in the IMS are involved in the assembly of Tob55, we imported Tob55 into swollen mitochondria in which the IMS was open. The formation of the assembly intermediate and the TOB complexes was strongly reduced when the outer membrane was ruptured (Fig. 6D). As a control, the assembly of Tom20 into the TOM complex was not affected by rupturing the outer membrane. Hence, opening of the IMS interferes with the assembly of Tob55. Assembly of Tob55 and Mas37 Precursors into Preexisting TOB Complexes—The final stage in the biogenesis of both Mas37 and Tob55 is the assembly of the newly synthesized precursors into TOB complexes. To verify that radiolabeled precursors of Tob55 and Mas37 can indeed assemble into the TOB complex, we imported them into mitochondria containing a His-tagged version of Tob38 (12Waizenegger T. Habib S.J. Lech M. Mokranjac D. Paschen S.A. Hell K. Neupert W. Rapaport D. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Upon lysis of the mitochondria and incubation with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads, both precursors were co-isolated with Tob38His, whereas no such interaction was observed with the control precursor of Tom20 (Fig. 7A). Tob38 and Mas37 are two components of the TOB complex. In the absence of Mas37, Tob55 together with Tob38 forms the TOB core complex (12Waizenegger T. Habib S.J. Lech M. Mokranjac D. Paschen S.A. Hell K. Neupert W. Rapaport D. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To investigate whether these latter two proteins and Mas37 play a role in the insertion into the outer membrane of Tob55 precursor, we performed import experiments with mitochondria lacking Mas37 or depleted of Tob55 or Tob38 (9Paschen S.A. Waizenegger T. Stan T. Preuss M. Cyrklaff M. Hell K. Rapaport D. Neupert W. Nature. 2003; 426: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 12Waizenegger T. Habib S.J. Lech M. Mokranjac D. Paschen S.A. Hell K. Neupert W. Rapaport D. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the absence of its partner protein, Tob38, or upon depletion of preexisting Tob55, the insertion of Tob55 was strongly impaired (Fig. 7, B and C). This reduction could be the outcome of the essential role of Tob55 in the assembly of all β-barrel proteins in the outer membrane and/or the result of the requirement of newly synthesized Tob55 molecules to assemble with preexisting Tob55 molecules. Only moderate reduction was observed when Tob55 was imported into mitochondria lacking Mas37 (Fig. 7C). These results are consistent with the observations that within the TOB complex, Tob55 interacts tightly with Tob38 and to a lesser extent with Mas37 (12Waizenegger T. Habib S.J. Lech M. Mokranjac D. Paschen S.A. Hell K. Neupert W. Rapaport D. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Ishikawa D. Yamamoto H. Tamura Y. Moritoh K. Endo T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Because Tob55 is predicted to be a β-barrel protein, we cannot exclude the possibility that in addition to interactions within the assembled TOB complex, some of the described effects are because radiolabeled Tob55 is also a substrate of Tob38 and Mas37. To demonstrate the importance of Tob38 for the stability of the assembled Tob55, we performed alkaline extraction experiments. Tob55 is embedded in the outer membrane, whereas its partner protein, Tob38, is only associated with the membrane and can be extracted by alkaline solution (9Paschen S.A. Waizenegger T. Stan T. Preuss M. Cyrklaff M. Hell K. Rapaport D. Neupert W. Nature. 2003; 426: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 12Waizenegger T. Habib S.J. Lech M. Mokranjac D. Paschen S.A. Hell K. Neupert W. Rapaport D. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After import of radiolabeled Tob55 into mitochondria, alkaline extraction was performed, and the membrane pellets were analyzed by BNGE. In mitochondria subjected to alkaline, no assembly intermediates of Tob55 were observed (Fig. 7D). In addition, the endogenous TOB complex was hardly detected upon immunostaining with antibodies against Tob55, whereas the TOM complex and porin assemblies were not affected (Fig. 7E). Taken together, these results lend further support for the importance of Tob38 in the assembly and stability of the TOB complex. It might be that the extraction of Tob38 results in aggregation of its partner protein Tob55, and therefore Tob55 cannot be detected by BNGE. The role of the TOB components in the association and assembly of Mas37 precursor was investigated. Surprisingly, association of Mas37 precursor molecules with mitochondria and their assembly into the TOB complex were increased by at least 2-fold when mitochondria lacking Mas37 were used (Fig. 8). Depletion of either Tob38 or Tob55 had an opposite effect. Mas37 precursor was not assembled into high molecular mass complexes when either Tob38 or Tob55 were depleted (Fig. 8B). Hence, newly synthesized Mas37 molecules do not need preexisting Mas37 molecules on mitochondria but rather require Tob55 and Tob38 for their proper targeting and assembly. These results are consistent with our previous observation that the endogenous levels of Mas37 in mitochondria depleted for either Tob38 or Tob55 are clearly reduced (12Waizenegger T. Habib S.J. Lech M. Mokranjac D. Paschen S.A. Hell K. Neupert W. Rapaport D. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It appears that precursors of Mas37 assemble directly with the TOB core complex, which is composed of Tob38 and Tob55. The TOB complex is essential for the biogenesis of mitochondrial β-barrel proteins. It is composed of three known proteins: Tob55, a putative β-barrel protein that is embedded in the outer membrane, and Tob38 and Mas37, two proteins that are peripherally associated with the membrane. In this way, the TOB complex belongs to those types of protein machineries that are composed of two different types of proteins. We investigated how components of this complex are recognized at the surface of mitochondria and assembled into functional TOB complex. Similar to other β-barrel proteins, the Tob55 precursor is recognized initially by the surface receptors Tom20 and Tom70. It is translocated across the outer membrane via the general import pore of the TOM complex, and then it is transferred to the TOB complex. The small Tim proteins appear to be involved in the assembly pathway of Tob55. These recognition and insertion steps of Tob55 are shared with other β-barrel proteins, such as Tom40, Mdm10, and porin (3Rapaport D. Neupert W. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 12396-12405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the assembly pathway of Tob55 differs from the assembly pathways of other β-barrel precursors in two major aspects. First, all β-barrel precursors are substrates of Tob38, but only Tob55 is an interacting partner of Tob38 in the functional TOB complex. This difference is reflected by the requirement of Tob38 for the stability of assembled Tob55. Although Tob38 is a peripheral membrane protein, its extraction destabilizes the structure of the membrane-embedded Tob55. A second difference in the assembly pathway of Tob55 in comparison with other β-barrel precursors is the role played by Mas37. Although Mas37 was reported to have an important role in the assembly of Tom40 and porin (10Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Scho ̈nfish B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), we observed that the deletion of Mas37 had only a moderate effect on the insertion of Tob55 into the outer membrane. These results are consistent with our previous observations that Tob55 and Tob38 form the TOB core complex in the absence of Mas37 and that the levels of expressed Tob55 are not affected by the deletion of Mas37 (12Waizenegger T. Habib S.J. Lech M. Mokranjac D. Paschen S.A. Hell K. Neupert W. Rapaport D. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The different roles of Mas37 in the assembly of the various β-barrel precursors point to a function downstream of the Tob55-Tob38 core complex. All β-barrel precursors may interact first with Tob55-Tob38 before being transferred further to other elements of the outer membrane in a process that requires Mas37. Because the precursor of Tob55 does not have to leave the TOB complex, it may not require Mas37 for its assembly. Recent findings on the role of Mdm10 in the assembly of the Tom40 precursor support our proposal (23Meisinger C. Rissler M. Chacinska A. Szklarz L.K. Milenkovic D. Kozjak V. Schonfisch B. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Yaffe M.P. Guiard B. Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It was suggested that Mdm10 is involved in the assembly pathway of Tom40 precursor in a step downstream of the TOB complex. The reported interaction of Mdm10 with Mas37 is compatible with a role of Mas37 in mediating the release of β-barrel precursors from the TOB complex. At present, we can only speculate how Tob55 is actually assembled into the TOB complex. Tob55 is predicted to form a β-barrel structure with an aqueous pore in the middle of its oligomeric structure (9Paschen S.A. Waizenegger T. Stan T. Preuss M. Cyrklaff M. Hell K. Rapaport D. Neupert W. Nature. 2003; 426: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 10Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Scho ̈nfish B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Hence, one possibility could be the insertion of newly synthesized Tob55 into the pore and lateral release into the complex; but such a mechanism would require major structural rearrangements of the β-barrel and disruption of many hydrogen bonds (1Gabriel K. Buchanan S.K. Lithgow T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 36-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hence, we favor a mechanism in which the preexisting Tob55 molecules serve as a scaffold for the newly synthesized Tob55 precursor. In such a mechanism, assembly can follow a concerted partitioning of the bulky β-barrel into the membrane. The TOM complex was found to be involved in the import of all mitochondrial precursor proteins analyzed thus far. On the other hand, the import pathway of a protein with a topology similar to that of Mas37, namely one that is associated on the surface of the organelle, had not been studied. Despite previous reports about interaction of Mas37 with the import receptor Tom70 (24Gratzer S. Lithgow T. Bauer R.E. Lamping E. Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Haucke V. Junne T. Schatz G. Horst M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we could not find any evidence for an involvement of the TOM complex in the biogenesis of Mas37. Rather, our findings suggest that Mas37 follows a unique import pathway where it is recognized directly by and assembled with the TOB core complex. The levels of Mas37 in mitochondria depleted of either Tob38 or Tob55 were indeed clearly reduced as compared with those in mitochondria from wild-type cells (12Waizenegger T. Habib S.J. Lech M. Mokranjac D. Paschen S.A. Hell K. Neupert W. Rapaport D. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Ishikawa D. Yamamoto H. Tamura Y. Moritoh K. Endo T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The observed higher efficiencies of association of Mas37 precursor with mitochondria lacking endogenous Mas37 molecules are consistent with such a pathway. In wild-type mitochondria, the vast majority of the TOB core complexes are in association with Mas37. In this situation, a site that could serve as a docking point for newly synthesized Mas37 molecules is probably occupied by these Mas37 molecules. In the absence of endogenous Mas37 molecules, this site on the TOB core complex is free, and more newly synthesized Mas37 molecules can dock on the surface of mitochondria. Further studies will be required to clarify what is the targeting information within the sequence of Mas37 and how this information is decoded by the TOB core complex. We thank P. Heckmeyer and M. Malesic for technical assistance. We also thank Dr. S. Funes for continuous support."
https://openalex.org/W2039087375,"The internalization of G protein-coupled receptors is regulated by several important proteins that act in concert to finely control this complex cellular process. Here, we have applied the RNA interference approach to demonstrate that ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) is essential for the endocytosis of a broad variety of receptors. Reduction of endogenous expression of ARF6 in HEK 293 cells resulted in a correlated inhibition of the β2 -adrenergic receptor internalization previously characterized as being sequestered via the clathrin-coated vesicle pathway. Furthermore, other receptors internalizing via this endocytic route, namely the angiotensin type 1 receptor and the vasopressin type 2 receptor, were also impaired in their ability to be sequestered when levels of endogenous ARF6 in cells were reduced. Interestingly, endocytosis of the endothelin type B receptor, characterized as being internalized via the caveolae pathway, was also markedly inhibited in ARF6-depleted cells. In contrast, internalization of the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor was unaffected by reduced levels of ARF6. Finally, internalization of the acetylcholine-muscarinic type 2 receptor via the non-clathrin-coated vesicle pathway was also inhibited in ARF6-depleted cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ARF6 proteins play an essential role in the internalization process of most G protein-coupled receptors regardless of the endocytic route being utilized. However, this phenomenon is not general. In some cases, another ARF isoform or other proteins may be essential to regulate the endocytic process."
https://openalex.org/W2057264167,"The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) Ca2+ channel plays pivotal roles in many aspects of physiological and pathological events. It was previously reported that IP3R forms clusters on the endoplasmic reticulum when cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]C) is elevated. However, the molecular mechanism of IP3R clustering remains largely unknown, and thus its physiological significance is far from clear. In this study we found that the time course of clustering of green fluorescent protein-tagged IP3R type 1 (GFP-IP3R1), evoked by IP3-generating agonists, did not correlate with [Ca2+]C but seemed compatible with cytoplasmic IP3 concentration. IP3 production alone induced GFP-IP3R1 clustering in the absence of a significant increase in [Ca2+]C but elevated [Ca2+]C without IP3 production did not. Moreover IP3R1 mutants that do not undergo an IP3-induced conformational change failed to form clusters. Thus, IP3R clustering is induced by its IP3-induced conformational change to the open state. We also found that GFP-IP3R1 clusters colocalized with ERp44, a luminal protein of endoplasmic reticulum that inhibits its channel activity. This is the first example of ligand-induced clustering of a ligand-gated channel protein. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) Ca2+ channel plays pivotal roles in many aspects of physiological and pathological events. It was previously reported that IP3R forms clusters on the endoplasmic reticulum when cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]C) is elevated. However, the molecular mechanism of IP3R clustering remains largely unknown, and thus its physiological significance is far from clear. In this study we found that the time course of clustering of green fluorescent protein-tagged IP3R type 1 (GFP-IP3R1), evoked by IP3-generating agonists, did not correlate with [Ca2+]C but seemed compatible with cytoplasmic IP3 concentration. IP3 production alone induced GFP-IP3R1 clustering in the absence of a significant increase in [Ca2+]C but elevated [Ca2+]C without IP3 production did not. Moreover IP3R1 mutants that do not undergo an IP3-induced conformational change failed to form clusters. Thus, IP3R clustering is induced by its IP3-induced conformational change to the open state. We also found that GFP-IP3R1 clusters colocalized with ERp44, a luminal protein of endoplasmic reticulum that inhibits its channel activity. This is the first example of ligand-induced clustering of a ligand-gated channel protein. Many extracellular stimuli are received by trimeric G protein- or tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors and relayed to signaling molecules including phospholipase C (PLC), 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R, IP3 receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;[Ca2+]C, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration; GFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PHD, pleckstrin homology domain of PLCδ; RT, room temperature; AM, acetoxymethyl ester; RFP, red fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; [Ca2+]free, free Ca2+ concentration; HEDTA, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine-N,N′,N′-triacetic acid; [IP3], cytosolic IP3 concentration; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. which leads to production of a second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4247) Google Scholar). IP3 in turn activates an internal membrane receptor/Ca2+ channel, the IP3 receptor (IP3R), and induces Ca2+ release from internal Ca2+ stores (mostly endoplasmic reticulum (ER)). This IP3-Ca2+ pathway is particularly important because it is located at the intersection of many signaling pathways and is therefore thought to play a central role in cellular signaling. Rather recently, evidence has been accumulating that the subcellular localization of IP3R is tightly controlled and changes according to circumstances (2Delmas P. Brown D.A. Neuron. 2002; 36: 787-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Zhang S. Mizutani A. Hisatsune C. Higo T. Bannai H. Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, IP3R is known to form large clusters on the ER (5Wilson B.S. Pfeiffer J.R. Smith A.J. Oliver J.M. Oberdorf J.A. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1465-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Very importantly, theoretical modeling (6Shuai J.W. Jung P. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2002; 88: 068102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 7Shuai J.W. Jung P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 8Swillens S. Champeil P. Combettes L. Dupont G. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) predicted that IP3R clustering affects both elementary events (e.g. Ca2+ blips and puffs) and the formation of complex cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]C) patterns (e.g. Ca2+ oscillations and waves). Particularly Shuai and Jung (6Shuai J.W. Jung P. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2002; 88: 068102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) predicted that if IP3 concentration is relatively low (i.e. physiological situation), there is an optimal extent of clustering of IP3 receptor for effective elevation of cytosolic calcium concentration. When the clusters of IP3 receptor would become very large, the whole calcium signals elicited by low IP3 concentrations would be significantly reduced. Experimental verification of this hypothesis has not been performed mainly because the molecular mechanism of IP3R clustering remains totally unknown, and thus it is impossible to inhibit or artificially modulate it. Wilson et al. (5Wilson B.S. Pfeiffer J.R. Smith A.J. Oliver J.M. Oberdorf J.A. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1465-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) suggested that IP3R clustering was triggered by increased [Ca2+]C since not only Ca2+-mobilizing agonists but a Ca2+ ionophore (ionomycin) and an inhibitor of sarco/endoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase (thapsigargin) induced it. They also showed that it is independent of ER vesiculation (9Subramanian K. Meyer T. Cell. 1997; 89: 963-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Later it was shown that two small GTP-binding proteins, Cdc42 and Rac, are involved in agonist-induced IP3R clustering but that was because they augmented Ca2+ signals as a whole and not because they influenced intracellular trafficking (10Hong-Geller E. Cerione R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In short, the detailed molecular mechanism of IP3R clustering remains largely unknown, and it is important to know it to understand precise roles of IP3R clustering. In this study we simultaneously imaged the dynamics of enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged IP3R type 1 (GFP-IP3R1) and [Ca2+]C by using fluorescent Ca2+ indicators. Based on the results of the mutational and pharmacological analyses, we concluded that IP3R clustering is initiated by a conformational change in IP3R protein to its open state.

To construct GFP-IP3R1-K508A, a KpnI-BglII fragment of G224 (IP3 sponge), which contains the appropriate substitution (15Uchiyama T. Yoshikawa F. Hishida A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

To construct GFP-IP3R1-D223, an AflII site was introduced at nucleotides 664–669 of mouse IP3R1 by PCR using primers (5′-GTGCTTAAGATGAAATGGAGTGATAACAAAG-3′ and 5′-GCTTCCTTGTCCTCCTTCAG-3′ for residues 989–1614 (the AflII site is underlined)) and GFP-IP3R1 as a template DNA. This PCR product was digested with AflII and KpnI and then subcloned into pcDNA3.1Zeo(+) vector with other parts of GFP-IP3R1.

The PCR product and other parts of IP3R1 were subcloned into pBact-ST-neoB (16Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1990; 5: 11-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1.0 g/liter glucose, and 4 mdl-glutamine. For the transfection experiments, cells were grown on 18-mm glass coverslips (coated with 50 μg/ml poly-l-lysine) or glass-bottomed microwell dishes (35 mm, uncoated) and transfected using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single Cell Imaging with a Fluorescence Microscope—Cells were incubated for 45 min at room temperature (RT) with 5 μm fura-2/AM and washed with balanced salt solution (115 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Cells were then placed on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX81, Olympus) and perfused at 37 °C with balanced salt solution supplemented with 10 μm α-tocopherol and 1 mm ascorbic acid at 1.2 ml/min. The cells were then excited at 340 and 380 nm for fura-2, 470–490 nm for GFP, and 510–550 nm for red fluorescent protein (RFP, DsRed2), and the fluorescence images were obtained through an objective lens (UplanApo 40× oil, numerical aperture = 1.35; Olympus) using 510–550 nm (for fura-2 and GFP) and long pass 590 nm (for RFP) emission filters with a charge-coupled device camera (ORCA-ER, Hamamatsu Photonics). Optimal beam splitters for each wavelength were inserted with a motorized beamsplitter exchanger. Fura-2 images were acquired with a binning factor (4 × 4) for 80–100 ms. GFP and RFP images were acquired with a binning factor (1 × 1) for 200–400 ms every 20 s. Fura-2 images were processed and presented after digitally smoothing to reduce the noise level. The smoothing filter was implemented by using 3 × 3 spatial convolutions where the value of each pixel in the selection is replaced with the weighted average of its 3 × 3 neighborhood. Center pixels were 4-fold weighted compared with the surrounding pixels. Image capturing and processing were performed with custom made software, TI Workbench (11Nakayama T. Hattori M. Uchida K.

Mikoshiba K. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 65: 236-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at RT. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) at RT for 10 min and treated with PBST containing 5% skim milk (PBSTM) at RT for 1 h. Cells were incubated with a monoclonal antibody to IP3R1 (18A10 (18Maeda N. Niinobe M. Nakahira K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1724-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), 1 μg/ml) in PBSTM overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated with Alexa-488-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes) at RT for 1 h. After washing five times with PBS, slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescent images were taken through a confocal microscope (FV-300, Olympus) on an inverted microscope (IX-70, Olympus) with an objective (UPlanApo 60× oil, numerical aperture = 1.40; Olympus). Time Lapse Imaging of GFP-PHD and the [Ca2+]C—COS-7 cells expressing GFP-PHD were incubated for 1 h at RT with 10 μm fura-red/AM (Molecular Probes) and washed. Cells were then mounted on the stage of the inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (FV-300, Olympus) and perfused at 37 °C with balanced salt solution supplemented with 10 μm α-tocopherol and 1 mm ascorbic acid at 1.2 ml/min. GFP and fura-red were excited with an argon laser (488 nm), and fluorescence images were simultaneously taken every 5 s with an objective (UPlanApo 60× oil, numerical aperture = 1.40; Olympus) using the green channel (510–550 nm) for GFP and the red channel (585–610 nm) for fura-red. Photobleach of fura-red was corrected by fitting the base-line time course of the fluorescence by a single exponential function. Permeabilization of COS-7 Cells—To represent resting and activated states of cells, two buffers with different free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]free) were prepared: buffer L (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% polyethylene glycol, 5 mm K2HEDTA, 0.05 mm CaHEDTA, pH 7.2) and buffer H (same composition except 0.25 mm, instead of 0.05 mm, Ca-HEDTA). The buffers L and H were calibrated to contain 180 nm and 1 μm [Ca2+]free on a Ca2+ electrode and assumed a resting state or an activated state [Ca2+]C of cells, respectively. COS-7 cells grown in glass-bottomed microwell dishes were washed with ice-cold buffer L twice, permeabilized with ice-cold buffer L containing 0.1% saponin for 2.5 min on ice, and washed with ice-cold buffer L five times. Cells were then incubated for 3 min at RT in either buffer L or buffer H supplemented either with 3.3 mm ATP or with ATP plus 5 μm IP3 and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at RT. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching Experiments—COS-7 cells expressing GFP-IP3R1 were mounted on the stage of a confocal microscope as described above, and the region of interest (100 × 100 pixels at zoom 2.5) was photobleached at full laser power. Fluorescence recovery was monitored by scanning the whole cell at low (0.1%) laser power. Images were captured every 5 s through a 60× oil objective. The temperature in the culture dish was maintained at 37 °C. GFP-tagged IP3R1 Forms Clusters following Agonist Stimulation—We utilized GFP-IP3R1 to perform real time imaging of IP3R clustering since we found that GFP-IP3R1 as well as wild-type IP3R1 (see Fig. 4A, left panel) formed clusters when stimulated with IP3-generating agents. Although GFP-IP3R1 formed clusters in various cell types such as HeLa and NIH-3T3 cells (data not shown), subsequent experiments were performed on COS-7 cells because their flat shape is suitable for examining the ER meshwork. The expression vector for DsRed2-KDEL, a red fluorescent ER-resident protein (3Zhang S. Mizutani A. Hisatsune C. Higo T. Bannai H. Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4048-4056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was co-transfected to enable monitoring of the structure of the ER (Fig. 1; see also Supplemental Video 1). A fine meshwork of IP3R1 and ER was observed before stimulation (Fig. 1A, a), but ∼1 min after the start of ATP (a Gq-coupled purinergic receptor agonist) stimulation, GFP-IP3R1 began to form clusters (Fig. 1A, b). Over the next several minutes, most of the clusters grew in size (Fig. 1A, c–f, upper panels) by sometimes fusing with adjacent clusters (Fig. 1A, d and e, arrows). After washing out the ATP, the clusters gradually decreased in size and number (Fig. 1A, g) and eventually disappeared (Fig. 1A, h). By contrast, the ER neither formed clusters nor vesiculated at any time during the process (Fig. 1A, lower panels). Thus, the agonist-induced clustering of GFP-IP3R1 is reversible and independent of reconstruction of the ER, a conclusion that is consistent with a previous report on clustering of endogenous IP3R2 and IP3R3 (5Wilson B.S. Pfeiffer J.R. Smith A.J. Oliver J.M. Oberdorf J.A. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1465-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The new findings in our real time analysis are that (i) the clusters themselves move considerably on the ER (best observed in Supplemental Video 1), (ii) the clusters sometimes fuse with each other, and most importantly (iii) cluster formation is a relatively slow process and takes tens of seconds to reach its maximal level after the start of stimulation. GFP-IP3R1 Clustering Does Not Correlate with [Ca2+]C— The above findings prompted us to perform simultaneous imaging of GFP-IP3R1 movement and [Ca2+]C changes. COS-7 cells expressing GFP-IP3R1 were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator dye fura-2/AM and stimulated with 10 μd ATP for 120 s. The typical results in Fig. 2, A and B, showed that [Ca2+]C peaked within 15 s and then gradually returned to the basal level (Fig. 2, A, g–l, and B, lower plot). When [Ca2+]C was around its peak level (Fig. 2A, h and i), however, no clear GFP-IP3R1 clusters were observed (Fig. 2A, b and c). They became prominent ∼50 s after ATP addition (Fig. 2A, d and j) when the [Ca2+]C was approximately at its half-maximal level (Fig. 2B, lower plot). After ATP washout, the GFP-IP3R1 clusters persisted for ∼60 s and then disappeared. Comparison between numbers of clusters in this region and [Ca2+]C (Fig. 2B, upper and lower plots, respectively) clearly indicated that both the formation and the disappearance of the clusters occurred significantly more slowly than the changes in the [Ca2+]C. As the summary of the simultaneous imaging (Fig. 2C) shows, in more than 60% of the cells, [Ca2+]C peaked within 15 s of ATP addition (Fig. 2C, top), but no clusters were ever observed in this period (Fig. 2C, middle). The first clear cluster was observed at between 20 and 120 s (Fig. 2C, middle), and in most cells (72%) the number of clusters increased as long as the agonist was present (Fig. 2C, bottom) although [Ca2+]C gradually decreased in this period. These results imply that high [Ca2+]C is not the direct cause of IP3R clustering. Next we applied two successive ATP stimuli ∼90 s apart since we had found that in this protocol the second stimulus evoked little Ca2+ elevation because of the ER depletion (Fig. 2F). Fig. 2, D and E, shows the typical example of repeated stimulation. In this case, the second stimulus evoked little Ca2+ elevation (Fig. 2E, lower plot). However, GFP-IP3R1 clustering was clearly reinduced by the second stimulus (Fig. 2D, d, and E, upper plot). A similar phenomenon was observed in 88% (14 of 16) of independent cells in which clusters disappeared before the second stimulation (in the rest of the cells (13%, 2 of 16), the second stimulus neither evoked [Ca2+]C elevation nor induced clustering). It was therefore concluded that the rise in [Ca2+]C is not necessarily required for IP3R clustering. A PLC Inhibitor Blocked IP3R1 Clustering Induced by Ca2+ Ionophore—What then is the critical determinant of IP3R clustering? One candidate was its most important ligand, IP3. Wilson et al. (5Wilson B.S. Pfeiffer J.R. Smith A.J. Oliver J.M. Oberdorf J.A. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1465-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) concluded that IP3R clustering is induced by increased [Ca2+]C because it was induced by a Ca2+ ionophore as well as by IP3-generating agonists. However, since it is well known that increased [Ca2+]C activates PLC and thus generates IP3 (19Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of the potent PLC inhibitor U-73122 on Ca2+ ionophore-induced clustering of GFP-IP3R1. Addition of the Ca2+ ionophore 4-bromo-A23187 in the presence of the non-effective analogue U-73343 induced GFP-IP3R1 clustering (Fig. 3A, d), whereas U-73122 significantly suppressed clustering (Fig. 3A, b). We therefore concluded that increased [Ca2+]C alone cannot induce IP3R clustering and that IP3 production is absolutely necessary. We also simultaneously imaged [Ca2+]C and the GFP-PHD, which translocates from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate is hydrolyzed to IP3 and diacylglycerol (13Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells expressing GFP-PHD were loaded with fura-red/AM, and fluorescence images were acquired every 5 s with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Both the increase in intensity of GFP-PHD in the cytoplasm and decrease in the plasma membrane were considered an indication of cytosolic IP3 concentration ([IP3]) (13Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, the Ca2+ transient evoked by ATP stimulation peaked in 20 s (Fig. 3C, lower plot), while [IP3] peaked much later (>55 s) (Fig. 3C, upper plot). This phenomenon has been reported in other cell lines (20Nash M.S. Young K.W. Willars G.B. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Morita M. Yoshiki F. Kudo Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Importantly the time course of the changes in [IP3] (Fig. 3C, upper plot) was quite similar to that of the cluster number (Fig. 2B, upper plot), suggesting that IP3 binding is the direct cause of IP3R clustering. We also investigated whether other pharmacological inhibitors (i.e. LiCl, wortmannin, PD98059, and H-7), whose target molecules are known to be activated by increased [Ca2+]C, inhibit GFP-IP3R1 clustering, but they had no effect on it (data not shown). In addition, we confirmed that ER depletion alone is insufficient for GFP-IP3R1 clustering by using the membrane-permeable low affinity divalent cation chelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (data not shown). IP3R1 Mutants That Do Not Undergo Activation Coupling Fail to Form Clusters—To identify the critical regions in IP3R protein for clustering, we investigated the effects of deletions or mutations of IP3R1 (Fig. 4). We first deleted the whole IP3 binding domain (IP3R1-D610) and found that the mutant does not form any clusters (Fig. 4B). We then mutated the single amino acid residue that is critical for IP3 binding (IP3R1-K508A), and again no clusters formed (Fig. 4B). The same phenomenon was observed in the case of IP3R2 and IP3R3 (data not shown). Thus, IP3 binding to IP3R is absolutely necessary for clustering. Next we used two mutants, IP3R1-C2613S and IP3R1-D223 to determine whether IP3 binding is sufficient for IP3R clustering. Although both mutants retain IP3 binding ability, they have no channel activity because they lack a residue or domain that is indispensable for activation coupling (12Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To our surprise, these mutants did not form any clusters (Fig. 4, A, middle panel, and B), suggesting that not only IP3 binding but the conformational change to open state is required for IP3R clustering. Substitution of aspartic acid 2550 by alanine (IP3R1-D2550A) in the ion permeation pore is known to abolish the Ca2+ releasing ability of IP3R1 without affecting the IP3-induced conformation change (22Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 2But in our observations, this mutant is able to release very little Ca2+ (Y. Tateishi, M. Hattori, T. Nakayama, M. Iwai, H. Bannai, T. Nakamura, T. Michikawa, T. Inoue, and K. Mikoshiba, unpublished). Since this mutant formed clusters to the same extent as the wild type (Fig. 4, A, right panel, and B), it was suggested that Ca2+ release through the channel pore is not required for clustering. Are Other Molecules Involved in IP3R Clustering?—Since IP3R is known to associate with more than 10 proteins (23MacKrill J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 345-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), we attempted to determine whether any of them might be involved in and/or be necessary for IP3R1 clustering. Immunocytochemistry, however, revealed that neither calmodulin, Ca2+-binding protein 1 (24Yang J. McBride S. Mak D.O. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7711-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), or IRBIT (25Ando H. Mizutani A. Matsu-ura T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10602-10612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), all of which bind to the N-terminal cytosolic region of IP3R1, had a distribution similar to that of the IP3R clusters when stimulated with ATP (data not shown). Nor did overexpression of these proteins have any effect on IP3R clustering (data not shown). The C-terminal region of IP3R1 binds to Protein 4.1N (3Zhang S. Mizutani A. Hisatsune C. Higo T. Bannai H. Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4048-4056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and protein phosphatase 1α (26Tang T.S. Tu H. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 403-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but these proteins do not appear to play a role in IP3R clustering because removal of this region from IP3R1 (IP3R1-D2736–2749) had no effect on clustering (Fig. 4B). Furthermore it was found that the extent of IP3R cluster formation is correlated with the receptor density (Fig. 5). There seems to be no clear threshold of density for cluster formation. These findings support the idea that the cluster formation is dependent on the conformational change of the receptor protein itself. If we were able to monitor IP3R clustering in permeabilized COS-7 cells, it would be possible to identify the factors that are required for IP3R clustering. However, we found that GFP-IP3R1 did not form clusters in permeabilized cells (Fig. 6) even when IP3, Ca2+, and ATP were supplied. In addition, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments showed that permeabilization of the plasma membrane significantly slowed movement (diffusion) of GFP-IP3R1 (Fig. 7), suggesting that a certain cytosolic factor(s) is required for lateral mobility of IP3R on the ER membrane.Fig. 7Permeabilization of the plasma membrane-slowed movement of GFP-IP3R1. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments were performed on intact (a and b) or permeabilized (c and d) COS-7 cells expressing GFP-IP3R1 at 37 °C.

Jung P. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2002; 88: 068102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 7Shuai J.W. Jung P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It was predicted that when IP3R clusters become very large, the whole calcium signals elicited by low IP3 concentrations (i.e. physiological situation) are significantly reduced (6Shuai J.W. Jung P. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2002; 88: 068102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 7Shuai J.W. Jung P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the present study we observed that the IP3R clusters were most prominent when [Ca2+]C was decaying or near its basal level (Fig. 2B), supporting the above idea. Very importantly, we found that ERp44, an ER luminal protein that inhibits channel activity of IP3R1 (14Higo T. Hattori M. Nakamura T. Natsume T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba T. Cell. 2005; 120: 85-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), colocalized with the GFP-IP3R1 after ATP stimulation (Fig. 8, a–c). Other ER luminal proteins such as calreticulin do not colocalize the cluster. Therefore, it is suggested that channel activity of IP3R in the clusters is negatively regulated at least partly by ERp44. All of the above results implicated the clustering event in suppression of whole intracellular Ca2+ signals. Finally we recently identified a splicing variant of IP3R type 2 that lacks a part of the ligand binding domain and thus can act as an anticlustering subunit in an IP3R tetramer. 3Iwai, M., Tateishi, Y., Hattori, M., Mizutani, A., Futatsugi, A., Inoue, T., Furuichi, T., Michikawa, T., and Mikoshiba, K. (January 4, 2005) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M413824200. Thus, IP3R clustering is most likely regulated at a number of steps. Concluding Remarks—We showed for the first time that IP3R clustering is induced by its conformational change to the open state. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of conformation change-dependent redistribution of ligand-gated channels. Further analysis of the molecular mechanism and physiological meaning will provide new general insights into how a channel protein responds to various types of stimulations and circumstances.

Here, we determined the crystal structure of the complex of PKCι and Par6α PB1 domains to a resolution of 1.5 Å. Both PB1 domains adopt a ubiquitin fold. PKCι PB1 presents an OPR, PC, and AID (OPCA) motif, 28 amino acid residues with acidic and hydrophobic residues, which interacts with the conserved lysine residue of Par6α PB1 in a front and back manner. On the interface, several salt bridges are formed including the conserved acidic residues on the OPCA motif of PKCι PB1 and the conserved lysine residue on the Par6α PB1. Structural comparison of the PKCι and Par6α PB1 complex with the p40phox and p67phox PB1 domain complex, subunits of neutrophil NADPH oxidase, reveals that the specific interaction is achieved by tilting the interface so that the insertion or extension in the sequence is engaged in the specificity determinant. The PB1 domain develops the interaction surface on the ubiquitin fold to increase the versatility of molecular interaction.

The PB1 domain develops the interaction surface on the ubiquitin fold to increase the versatility of molecular interaction. Cell polarity is a fundamental property related to many cellular processes. Recently, a complex of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) 1The abbreviations used are: aPKC, atypical protein kinase C; TJ, tight junction; SeMet, selenomethionine; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; wt, wild type; OPCA, OPR, PC, and AID.1The abbreviations used are: aPKC, atypical protein kinase C; TJ, tight junction; SeMet, selenomethionine; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; wt, wild type; OPCA, OPR, PC, and AID. and Par6 (aPKC-Par6) has received much attention as a common cell polarity regulator conserved from nematodes to mammals. Par6 was initially identified as one of the products of par genes (par-1 to par-6) encoding essential components of cell division in the early embryo found by lethal genetic screening of Caenorhabditis elegans (1Watts J.L. Etemad-Moghadam B. Guo S. Boyd L. Draper B.W. Mello C.C. Priess J.R. Kemphues K.J. Development. 1996; 122: 3133-3140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to Par proteins, a defect in Pkc3 (a homologue of aPKC in C. elegans) also disrupts embryonic polarity (2Tabuse Y. Izumi Y. Piano F. Kemphues K.J. Miwa J. Ohno S. Development. 1998; 125: 3607-3614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). aPKC-Par6 is a conserved signaling complex from C. elegans to Homo sapiens (3Ohno S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and is now regarded as a common regulator for asymmetric cell division (4Betschinger J. Mechtler K. Knoblich J.A. Nature. 2003; 422: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 5Cai Y. Yu F. Lin S. Chia W. Yang X. Cell. 2003; 112: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), directed cell migration (6Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2003; 421: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), axon specification (7Shi S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and tight junction (TJ) formation in epithelial cells (8Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) in various species. Thus, aPKC-Par6 is an essential clue to evolutionary conserved cell polarity regulation (9Macara I.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 3: 220-231Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar). aPKC-Par6 is characteristically located at a specific region of cells, such as the anterior cortex of the nematode embryo (1Watts J.L. Etemad-Moghadam B. Guo S. Boyd L. Draper B.W. Mello C.C. Priess J.R. Kemphues K.J. Development. 1996; 122: 3133-3140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tabuse Y. Izumi Y. Piano F. Kemphues K.J. Miwa J. Ohno S. Development. 1998; 125: 3607-3614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), apical cortex of fly neuroblasts (10Petronczki M. Knoblich J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 3: 43-49Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 11Wodarz A. Ramrath A. Grimm A. Knust E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1361-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), leading edge of migrating cells (6Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2003; 421: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), and TJs in epithelial cells (8Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), implying that the complex formation is required for aPKC specific localization. The regulation of cellular localization as well as kinase activity of aPKC is essential for phosphorylation of its intrinsic target. Thus, the scaffold proteins that bind to PKCs play a crucial role in the control of the cellular localization of PKCs (12Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). In particular, TJ formation is a prototype of cell polarity events. TJs encircle cells at the most apical region of the lateral membrane and function as both paracellular and intramembrane diffusion barriers. Moreover TJ formation triggers cell proliferation and differentiation (14Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar, 15Matter K. Balda M.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). aPKC-Par6 is localized at the TJs and together with Par3 is involved in TJ assembly. Although recruitment of the ternary complex to the TJs and regulation of TJ formation are still elusive, phosphorylation by aPKC seems to be a clue to signal transduction because the kinase activity deficient aPKC abrogates TJ formation (16Suzuki A. Yamanaka T. Hirose T. Manabe N. Mizuno K. Shimizu M. Akimoto K. Izumi Y. Ohnishi T. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1183-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Notably, Par6 can regulate aPKC kinase activity in a Cdc42-dependent manner (17Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Kitamura K. Maniwa R. Nagai Y. Yamashita A. Hirose T. Ishikawa H. Ohno S. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The complex formation of aPKC and the scaffold protein Par6 is established through the interaction between PB1 domains existing at the N terminus of both proteins. In TJ formation, the disruption of PB1-PB1 interaction in aPKC-Par6 causes mislocalization of aPKC or Par6 (18Noda Y. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Ota K. Yoshinaga S. Inagaki F. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43516-43524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, PB1-PB1 interaction between aPKC and Par6 is related to their localization and has an indispensable role in cell polarity-related processes. Until now, the PB1 domain has been found in more than 200 signaling proteins including p40phox, p67phox, cytosolic factors of NADPH oxidase, Bem1p, Cdc24p, MEK5 and p62/ZIP on the SMART data base (19Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that PB1 domain functions as a protein binding module through PB1-mediated heterodimerization or homo-oligomerization (20Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Terasawa H. Noda Y. Ito T. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3947-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Ponting C.P. Ito T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. Trends Biochem.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4888-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The PB1 domain is further classified into two types, type I and type II PB1 domains. The PB1-mediated complex is formed through the interaction between type I and type II PB1 domains. Type I PB1 adopts the OPCA motif as a binding site, a remarkable consensus sequence in the PB1 domain with conserved acidic and hydrophobic residues (12Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 24Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 5: 2353-2357Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 25Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Mizuki K. Hata K. Ago T. Kitajima S. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the other hand, type II PB1 requires a conserved lysine residue in β1 (Fig. 1). Binding assays for PB1-PB1 interaction suggest that the electrostatic interaction between conserved acidic residues on the OPCA motif in type I-PB1 and a conserved basic residue in type II PB1 is responsible for PB1-PB1 interaction. Despite its electrostatic nature, the PB1-PB1 interaction is highly specific and exclusive (20Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, aPKC binds to several proteins such as Par6, ZIP/p62, and MEK5 through its PB1 domain (18Noda Y. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Ota K. Yoshinaga S. Inagaki F. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43516-43524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Lamark T. Perander M. Outzen H.

To date, whereas structure determination of the PB1 domain has been performed (21Terasawa H. Noda Y. Ito T. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3947-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Yoshinaga S. Kohjima M. Ogura K. Yokochi M. Takeya R. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31883-31890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the general and specific properties of the PB1-PB1 interaction mode are yet to be elucidated. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the PB1 domain complex of PKCι and Par6α. Although the electrostatic interaction was assumed to be responsible for complex formation, the structure reveals salt bridge formation in the PB1-PB1 complex. Furthermore, it provides insights into the general and specific properties of PB1-PB1 interaction. We also identified the role of PB1-PB1 interaction in TJ formation in aPKC-Par6. Plasmid Construction—Complementary DNA fragments encoding various lengths of human Par6α and PKCι were prepared as described previously (18Noda Y. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Ota K. Yoshinaga S. Inagaki F. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43516-43524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Noda Y. Takeya R. Ohno S. Naito S. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mutations leading to the indicated amino acid substitutions were introduced by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutated fragments were cloned into the indicated vectors. All the constructs were sequenced to confirm their identities. Sample Preparation for Crystallization—The PKCι (16–99) gene was cloned in pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences), and the Par6α (14–95) gene was cloned in pET HP, a modified version of pET-28a (Novagen), converting the thrombin protease recognition site into the PreScission protease recognition site. Both constructs were co-expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Because PKCι-(16–99) and Par6α-(14–95) form a complex in E. coli cells, the complex is acquired via purification from bacterial lysate by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences). After proteins were treated with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences), purification using anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography were performed. On the process of purification, PKCι-(16–99) and Par6α-(14–95) retained a stable complex. Finally, the complex of PKCι PB1 and Par6α PB1 was concentrated up to 12–15 mg/ml in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol, and this solution was used for crystallization. Selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted protein was expressed in E. coli strain B834 (DE3) with LeMaster medium (30LeMaster D.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Purification was performed in the same manner as native protein preparation, and SeMet substitution for Met was confirmed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. After concentration to 12–15 mg/ml, SeMet derivatives were used as a crystallization sample. Crystallization—Crystallization screening was performed using a sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K. 100 μl of volume of reservoir was applied to wells on crystal clear strips no indent (Hampton Research). Each drop consisted of 0.5 μl of protein solution and an equal amount of reservoir solution. Approximately 12–15 mg/ml of the complex of PKCι PB1 and Par6α PB1 in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol was used for crystallization. A single crystal was obtained in 3.6 m sodium formate and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.0) at 293 K by using a microseeding technique. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Prior to x-ray diffraction experiments, crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution (3.6 m sodium formate, 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.0), 20% glycerol) for several seconds and were immediately flash-cooled to 100 K in a nitrogen gas stream. Native diffraction data were collected on an MAR CCD detector using synchrotron radiation at the BL41XU beam line, SPring-8. The camera to crystal distance was set to 150 mm, and a total of 180 images were collected at 1° oscillation angle per image. The diffraction data were processed using the HKL2000 program (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to space group P21212 with unit cell parameters a = 94.150 Å, b = 38.363 Å, c = 45.478 Å and a cell volume of 164,261 Å3. The molecular mass of a complex of PKCι PB1 and Par6α PB1 was ∼19,427 Da, thus, the Matthews coefficient (VM) was 2.1 Å3/Da and the solvent content was 42%, assuming one molecule exist in an asymmetric unit. Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data sets were collected using a single crystal of SeMet-substituted protein at three wavelengths at the BL41XU beam line, SPring-8 as well as native data sets.

Université Aix-Marseile II, Marseille, France1997Google Scholar). Finally, refinement was performed up to 1.5 Å, and the statistics are summarized in Table I. The coordinates and structure factor of a PB1 domain complex of PKCι and Par6α have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1WMH). The molecular surface model was generated by the GRASP program (34Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar). All figures of the structural model except the model of electrostatic surface potential were created by Pymol software. Yeast Two-hybrid Experiments—Yeast HF7c cells containing a HIS3 reporter gene were co-transformed with a pair of pGBT9 (Clontech) encoding the wild-type or mutant PKCι and pGADGH (Clontech) encoding the wild-type or mutant Par6α as described previously (35Koga H. Terasawa H. Nunoi H. Takeshige K. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25051-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Following the selection for Trp+ and Leu+ phenotype, the transformants were tested for their ability to grow on plates lacking histidine supplemented with 2 mm 3-aminotriazole to suppress background growth according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Clontech). Formation of Epithelial Tight Junction—To investigate the effect of PKCι or Par6α on formation of TJs, we performed a calcium switch method using canine kidney epithelial MDCK cells. Briefly, MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (36Kohjima M. Noda Y. Takeya R. Saito N. Takeuchi K. Sumimoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and transfected with pEF-BOS-hemagglutinin, a vector for expression as a HA-tagged protein, that encodes the indicated form of PKCι or Par6α (36Kohjima M. Noda Y. Takeya R. Saito N. Takeuchi K. Sumimoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After incubation for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, the transfected cells were seeded on 12-mm round glass coverslips and grown in normal calcium medium to form confluent monolayers. The monolayer cells were cultured for 60 min in the calcium-free medium S-MEM (Invitrogen) and then incubated for 2 h in the calcium-containing medium Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed for 15 min with 3.7% formaldehyde and then permeabilized for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After blocking for 60 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin, the samples were initially incubated with anti-HA (Y11) rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-ZO-1 mouse monoclonal antibody (36Kohjima M. Noda Y. Takeya R. Saito N. Takeuchi K. Sumimoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Images were visualized with an LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss). Overall Structure of the PB1 Complex of PKCι and Par6α— The crystal structure of the PB1 complex of PKCι and Par6α has been determined to a resolution of 1.5 Å by a multiwavelength anomalous dispersion technique using an SeMet-substituted protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The crystal belongs to the space group P21212, and one complex exists per asymmetric unit. Of a total of 175 residues, 5 N-terminal residues of PKCι PB1 and 4 N-terminal residues of Par6α PB1 that are derived from cloning artifacts and Cys99 of PKCι PB1, a C-terminal residue of the construct, are disordered. In Par6α PB1, Pro87 adopts a cis conformation. A summary of the collected data and the structural statistics is given in Table I. The overall structure of the complex is shown in Fig. 2A. Both PB1 domains comprise two α helices and a mixed β-sheet which consists of five β strands that belong to the ubiquitin superfamily. The OPCA motif region of PKCι (Leu56-Leu83) has a ββα fold, and the β turn is categorized as a type I + G1 β-bulge, characteristic of type I PB1 domains (23Yoshinaga S. Kohjima M. Ogura K. Yokochi M. Takeya R. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4888-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The PB1 domains of PKCι and Par6α are remarkably similar as shown in Fig. 2B (root mean square deviation = 0.86 Å for backbone atoms). Because the solution structure of PKCι (free state) was determined by NMR (28Hirano Y. Yoshinaga S. Ogura K. Yokochi M. Noda Y. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31883-31890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the free and the complex states of PKCι PB1 can be compared (Fig. 2C). Both of the overall structures are well superimposed (root mean square deviation = 0.96 Å for backbone atoms). We performed superimposition between free and complex state structures, using not only over all structure but also more limited region such as OPCA motif. As the result, free and complex state structures are uniformly superimposed, and notable conformational exchange is not observed except for the loop region that is flexible in free structure. Interaction Surface of the PKCι and Par6α PB1 Complex— Despite the overall structural similarity between the PKCι and Par6α PB1 domains, they formed an asymmetric heterodimer using a different surface from each protein (Fig. 2A). The interaction surface of PKCι PB1 is the OPCA motif corresponding to β3, β4, and α2, whereas that of Par6α PB1 is composed of β1, β2, the C-terminal region of α1, and the N-terminal region of β5. Thus, PKCι serves as a type I PB1 domain and Par6α serves as a type II PB1 domain, respectively, as was suggested by the previous mutational analyses (18Noda Y. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Ota K.

Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In PKCι PB1, the OPCA motif is responsible for the interaction with Par6α PB1, but no other regions are involved in the interaction. The interaction surface of PKCι PB1 presents two acidic regions, A1 (Asp63, Glu65, and Asp67) and A2 (Glu76), whereas that of Par6α is comprised of two basic regions, B1 (Lys19, Arg28 and Arg89) and B2′ (Arg27) (Fig. 3A). In Par6α PB1, Arg27 and Arg28, two consecutive basic residues on β2, direct their side chains to the opposite side so that Par6α PB1 presents two distinct basic regions, B1 and B2′, at both sides of β2 (Fig. 3A, right). The complementarity of the surface potential between A1-B1 and A2-B2′ supports the notion that electrostatic interaction plays a major role in PB1 heterodimer formation. In addition to these interactions, Arg82 (PKCι)-Glu17 (Par6α) and a hydrophobic interaction, including Leu75 of PKCι and Phe29, Leu45, and Val49 of Par6α, also contribute to the intermolecular interaction (Fig. 3A). Description of the Interface in the PKCι-Par6α PB1 Domain Complex—A detailed inspection of the interface gives the characteristic interaction mode in the PKCι-Par6α complex (Fig. 3, A and B). In PKCι PB1, A1 is located on the β turn in the OPCA motif formed by the conserved acidic residues, Asp63, Glu65, and Asp67. As the β turn adopts a type I + G1 β bulge, these acidic residues orient to the same side to form an acidic surface. B1 of Par6α consists of Lys19 in β1, Arg28 in β2, and Arg89 in β5. The complementarily charged side chains of PKCι and Par6α form salt bridges as shown in Fig. 2B. Notably, Lys19 of Par6α PB1 forms salt bridges with all of the three conserved acidic residues. The interaction mediated by Lys19 is consistent with its strict conservation in type II PB1. Arg28 and Arg89 of Par6α interact with Glu65 and Asp63 of PKCι, which fix these carboxyl groups to assist salt bridge formation with Lys19 as well as to compensate for charges on the salt bridge network. Thus, A1-B1 is a major interaction site in the complex formation (Fig. 3B). In the complex of p40phox-p67phox PB1 domains, the corresponding acidic residues on the OPCA motif in p40phox (Asp289, Glu291, and Asp293) interact with the conserved lysine residue in p67phox (Lys355) in a manner similar to that in the PKCι-Par6α complex (27Wilson M.I. Gill D.J. Perisic O. Quinn M.T. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The importance of this interaction is evident considering that the type I PB1 domain contains an arginine residue instead of a lysine residue. To form tight salt bridges with the three acidic residues, the lysine residue is essential in this position (Fig. 1). In addition to the A1-B1 interaction, two other interactions, including A2-B2′ and Arg82-Glu17, are to be noted (Fig. 3B). A2 is located on α2 of PKCι PB1 to interact with B2′ of Par6α PB1. Glu76 located on α2 of PKCι PB1 forms a salt bridge with Arg27 on β2 of Par6α PB1, which also forms a hydrogen bond with Ser72 of PKCι. Glu17 of Par6α and Arg82 of PKCι are located close to each other to form a salt bridge. Furthermore, intramolecular salt bridge formation between Glu79 and Arg82 of PKCι and between Glu17 and Arg28 of Par6α is observed (Fig. 3B). Besides these salt bridges, there are hydrophobic interactions involving Leu75 on α2 of PKCι and Leu45 and Val49 on β3 and Phe29 on β2 of Par6α (Fig. 3A). In the interface, not only intermolecular salt bridges but also a number of intramolecular salt bridges and hydrogen bonds are formed. These interactions are observed throughout the interface and form a network (Fig. 3C). Although the intramolecular salt bridges do not directly contribute to the binding, the salt bridge network may affect their side chain coordination to assist in the formation of a stable complex. There are a relatively small number of hydrophobic interactions and water-mediated hydrogen bonds in the interface. The surface area of the PKCι-Par6α complex is ∼1141 Å2, which is appreciably smaller than those of other protein complexes (37Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). Tight interaction between PB1 domains is mainly caused by the salt bridge and hydrogen bond formations that amounted to 10 in the complex and much less to hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, the interface of the PKCι-Par6α PB1 complex is very compact but sufficient to form a stable protein-protein complex. Mutational Analyses of the Residues Responsible for Complex Formation—The mutational analyses using the yeast two-hybrid method were performed to confirm the molecular interaction. The conserved acidic residue (Asp63) in PKCι PB1 and the conserved lysine residue in Par6α (Lys19) were mutated to alanine, which completely abrogated the binding with each counterpart. The K20A mutation in PKCι PB1 and the D63A mutation in Par6α showed similar binding affinity to the wild type (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with the previous mutational experiments using a pull-down binding assay (18Noda Y. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Ota K. Yoshinaga S. Inag"

Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease involving both impaired insulin secretion and peripheral insulin resistance impacted by genetics and the environment (1Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1066-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) 1The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IGF-1R, IGF-1 receptor; IR, insulin receptor; WT, wild type; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding domain; PH, pleckstrin homology domain. functions as one of the key downstream signaling molecules in both the insulin receptor and the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor signaling pathways (IGF-1R). Thus genetic changes in IRS-1 may potentially contribute toward the development of insulin resistance. Screening of IRS-1 has identified a number of genetic variants, the most common of these being a glycine to arginine change at codon 972 (G972R) (Fig. 1) (2Almind K. Bjorbaek C. Vestergaard H. Hansen T. Echwald S.M. Pedersen O. Lancet. 1993; 342: 828-832Abstract PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This polymorphism is found in ∼5% of the normal population and 10% of Type 2 diabetics (3Hitman G.A. Hawrami K. McCarthy M.I. Viswanathan M. Snehalatha C. Ramachandran A. Tuomilehto J. Tuomilehtowolf E. Nissinen A. Pedersen O. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and carriers of the G972R variant have a 25% increased risk for developing Type 2 diabetes (4Jellema A. Zeegers M.P. Feskens E.J. Dagnelie P.C. Mensink R.P. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The G972R polymorphism appears to be associated with obesity because it is found more commonly among obese populations compared with lean populations (5Baroni M.G. Arca M. Sentinelli F. Buzzetti R. Capici F. Lovari S. Vitale M. Romeo S. Di Mario U. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and decreased insulin sensitivity has been observed in obese carriers of the polymorphism (6Clausen J.O. Hansen T.

Normal glucose-tolerant subjects carrying the G972R change have also been shown to have decreased insulin secretion (7Stumvoll M. Fritsche A. Volk A. Stefan N. Madaus A. Maerker E. Teigeler A.

In addition, an association with an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease has been reported in people with this polymorphism (8Baroni M.G. D'Andrea M.P. Montali A. Pannitteri G.

After autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor, the receptor kinase is activated and phosphorylates IRS-1 and other intracellular substrates. This signaling molecule then acts as a docking protein for multiple Src homology-2 domain (SH2)-containing proteins, including PI 3-kinase, Grb-2, and SHP2 (13Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). In vitro studies in 32D(IR) cells have demonstrated that when the G972R polymorphism was expressed, it caused impaired insulin-stimulated signaling along the PI 3-kinase pathway (14Almind K. Inoue G. Pedersen O. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 2569-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).

Circulation. 2004; 109: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), demonstrating that this polymorphism has detrimental effects in multiple insulin-sensitive tissues. In this study we have investigated the detailed molecular mechanism by which this polymorphism may be linked to insulin resistance. The G972R polymorphism is found near the C terminus of IRS-1 flanked by two tyrosine phosphorylation consensus sites (EY941MLM and DY989MTM), which are known binding sites for the p85α regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 1). A series of recombinant fragments from this region of human IRS-1 were produced with either a glycine or an arginine at codon 972. These included fragments containing amino acid residues 925–1008, both of the flanking tyrosine phosphorylation consensus sites and overlapping fragments containing residues 950–1027 or 910–986, which contain either the downstream (DY989MTM) or the upstream (EY941MLM) tyrosine phosphorylation consensus sites, respectively (Fig. 2). These fragments were used in in vitro experiments with purified insulin receptor to investigate the mechanism by which the G972R polymorphism contributes to altered insulin signaling. Cloning of the IRS-1 Fragments—DNA fragments (nucleotides 3793–4044, 3868–4101, and 3748–3975 of wild type human IRS-1 cDNA) corresponding to amino acid residues 925–1008, 950–1027, and 910–986 respectively were amplified using standard PCR techniques with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each of the primers contained a restriction site (BamHI in the forward primer, HindIII in the reverse primer) at the 5′ end for cloning purposes. After digestion, the amplified DNA was cloned into BamHI/HindIII-cleaved pQE30 vector (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Plasmid pQE30 contains a sequence encoding a His6 tag located upstream of the cloned fragments. The G972R polymorphism (codon change GGG → CGG) was introduced into each of the wild type plasmids using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, and the clones were sequenced to confirm introduction of the polymorphism. The DNA was used to transform Escherichia coli strain M15 containing a lac repressor plasmid (pRep4, Qiagen). Production of Recombinant IRS-1 Fragments—Recombinant clones were grown at 37 °C in LB containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a concentration of 1 mm at the end of the log phase. Growth was continued for an additional 4 h. Cells were lysed in loading buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4,10 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 8) on ice, sonicated to reduce viscosity, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The cleared lysate was incubated with Talon cobalt metal-affinity resin (BD Biosciences). The resin bound to the His-tagged protein was then loaded on to a column, washed exhaustively with loading buffer, and eluted with loading buffer supplemented with 150 mm imidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm EDTA. Eluted protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, 33 mm NaCl, 0.66 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4. Purification of the Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Receptor—Insulin receptor knock-out brown preadipocytes stably over-expressing human IGF-1R were lysed in 10 mm Tris HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium orthophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 nm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and complete protease inhibitor tablets (one per 50 ml, pH 7.6, Roche Applied Science). After sonication, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, and the cleared lysate was loaded onto a wheat germ agglutinin-agarose column (Amersham Biosciences) and passed through three times. The column was washed exhaustively with 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.6, and the IGF-1R was eluted from the column using wash buffer supplemented with 0.6 mN-acetylglucosamine (Sigma). In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—Purified full-length insulin receptor (kind gift of Jongsoon Lee, Joslin Diabetes Center) was incubated with 100 nm insulin for 60 min at room temperature and was then supplemented with 50 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 8 mm MnCl2 (final concentrations). Recombinant IRS-1 fragments were added, and a time course of phosphorylation was performed. To investigate the inhibition of insulin receptor autophosphorylation, we incubated recombinant IRS-1 fragments with the insulin-activated insulin receptor prior to the addition of 50 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 8 mm MnCl2 and performed a time course. At each time point, the reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A similar protocol was used for the phosphorylation assays performed using commercial insulin receptor kinase fragments, IR-(966–1271) (InsR active, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or IR-(947–1343) (βIRK, BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), except no preincubation with insulin was required to activate the kinase. To investigate the inhibition of IGF-1R autophosphorylation, we incubated full-length purified IGF-1R with 100 nm IGF-1 for 60 min at room temperature to activate the receptor. Recombinant IRS-1-(925–1008) fragments were added prior to the addition of 50 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 8 mm MnCl2, and a time course of phosphorylation was performed. Pull-down Experiments—Recombinant IRS-1-(925–1008) fragments were added to full-length insulin receptor activated with insulin, supplemented with 50 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 8 mm MnCl2 (final concentrations), and were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation with Talon metal-affinity resin for 90 min, the affinity resin-protein complexes were washed three times with loading buffer (see above), solubilized in Laemmli's sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western Blots—Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and identified by immunoblotting with primary antibodies including anti-His (Qiagen), anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-insulin receptor β-subunit (Upstate Biotechnology). Blots were incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). In Vitro Phosphorylation of the IRS-1-(925–1008) Fragment Is Reduced by the G972R Polymorphism—In vivo association of IRS-1 via the PTB domain (Fig. 1) with Tyr960 of the insulin receptor is normally required for optimal phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the insulin receptor (20White M.F. Livingston J.N. Backer J.M. Lauris V. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 641-649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 21Kaburagi Y. Momomura K. Yamamoto-Honda R. Tobe K. Tamori Y. Sakura H. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16610-16622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IRS-1-(925–1008) wild type and G972R His-tagged fusion proteins, which contain both of the flanking tyrosine phosphorylation consensus sites (Fig. 2), were incubated with purified full-length human insulin receptor, and a time course of tyrosine phosphorylation was performed. Under the conditions used, the wild type (WT) recombinant fragment was able to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 3) despite the absence of the PTB domain in this fragment. Introduction of the G972R polymorphism into the IRS-1-(925–1008) fragment reduced the level of phosphorylation seen by >60% (Fig. 3). Mass spectrometry of the WT and G972R phosphopeptides confirmed that phosphorylation was significantly reduced at Tyr941 in the EY941MLM phosphorylation consensus site upstream of the polymorphism compared with the WT (data not shown). The phosphopeptide containing the DY989MTM consensus site could not be detected under the conditions used for mass spectrometry; therefore, the extent of reduction at this site could not be determined. The IRS-1-(925–1008) G972R Fragment Associates with the Insulin Receptor—Pull-down experiments were performed to investigate any association between the insulin receptor and IRS-1-(925–1008). The WT and G972R His-tagged fragments were incubated with insulin-activated insulin receptor followed by pull-down experiment with Talon metal-affinity resin specific for the His tag. Immunoblotting of the metal-affinity resin-protein complexes for the insulin receptor indicates that there was an association between the insulin receptor and the IRS-1-(925–1008) fragments (Fig. 4) and that this was markedly enhanced when the fragment contained the G972R polymorphism. The IRS-1-(925–1008) G972R Fragment Inhibits Autophosphorylation of the Insulin Receptor and the IGF-1R—To determine the mechanism by which the phosphorylation of the IRS-1-(925–1008) G972R fragment was reduced, we preincubated the insulin receptor with the IRS-1-(925–1008) fragments prior to the addition of ATP, and we performed a time course of insulin receptor autophosphorylation after the addition of ATP. Fig. 5A illustrates that, in the presence of the IRS-1-(925–1008), WT fragment autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor was robust and increased over time. In the presence of the IRS-1-(925–1008) G972R fragment, the autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor was markedly reduced (Fig. 5A), demonstrating that the IRS-1-(925–1008) G972R fragment acts as a competitive inhibitor of insulin receptor autophosphorylation. This effect occurred in a dose-dependent manner with decreasing insulin receptor autophosphorylation as increasing molar concentrations of IRS-1-(925–1008) G972R were added (Fig. 6). The IRS-1-(925–1008) G972R fragment was also able to significantly reduce autophosphorylation of the IGF-1R compared with the IRS-1-(925–1008) WT fragment (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that the IRS-1 G972R may also act as a competitive inhibitor of IGF-1R activity.Fig. 6IRS-1-(925–1008) G972R inhibits autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor in a dose-dependent manner. The IRS-1-(925–1008) WT and G972R (GR) fragments were preincubated with the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase construct, IR-(947–1343) (made up of insulin receptor residues 947–1343), in equimolar, 10× molar, or 20× molar concentrations. After the addition of 50 μm ATP, samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, and 10 min, were separated by 10% reducing SDS-PAGE, and were immunoblotted (IB) with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (anti pY) to detect levels of autophosphorylation of IR-(947–1343).

IR-(966–1271) (InsR active, Upstate Biotechnology) includes insulin receptor residues 966–1271, spanning the juxtamembrane region of the β-subunit through the tyrosine kinase domain but not including Tyr960 (Fig. 7A). IR-(947–1343) (βIRK, BioMol) is a larger insulin receptor construct that contains residues 947–1343 and that also spans the tyrosine kinase domain and does contain Tyr960 (Fig. 7A). In vitro phosphorylation assays were performed, and the IRS-1-(925–1008) G972R fragment was shown to inhibit autophosphorylation of both IR-(966–1271) (Fig. 7B, i) and IR-(947–1343) (Fig. 7B, ii). This demonstrates that the interaction between the insulin receptor and the IRS-1-(925–1008) fragment occurs between residues 966–1271 of the insulin receptor, most likely in the kinase domain, and does not require Tyr960 for the interaction. To localize the site of interaction on the IRS-1-(925–1008) fragment and to determine the importance of the two flanking phosphorylation sites (EY941MLM and DY989MTM), a new set of overlapping IRS-1 fragments were produced, also as His-tagged fusion proteins. A WT fragment containing IRS-1 residues 950–1027 (IRS-1(950–1027)) and the single tyrosine phosphorylation site, DY989MTM, was produced along with the corresponding G972R-containing fragment (Fig. 2). In addition, a WT fragment, containing IRS-1 residues 910–986 (IRS-1-(910–986)) and the other tyrosine phosphorylation site, EY941MLM, was also produced along with the corresponding G972R-containing fragment (Fig. 2). In vitro phosphorylation assays were performed using the IR-(947–1343) construct containing the insulin receptor kinase and the new overlapping fragments. The IRS-1(950–1027) G972R and IRS-1-(910–986) G972R fragments were both able to inhibit autophosphorylation of IR-(947–1343) (Fig. 8, B and C) in a similar manner to IRS-1-(925–1008) G972R (Fig. 8A). This demonstrates that residues 950–986 of IRS-1, which are common to all of the IRS-1 fragments, are required for this interaction. The aim of these experiments was to provide an understanding at a molecular level of how the most common human polymorphism in IRS-1, the G972R polymorphism, may be contributing to insulin resistance and diabetes. This study has demonstrated that the G972R variant alters the ability of the recombinant IRS-1-(925–1008) fragment to be phosphorylated at specific tyrosine residues (EY941MLM and DY989MTM) flanking the polymorphism, which normally form high affinity binding sites for the p85α regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. Reduced phosphorylation of IRS-1 at the flanking tyrosine phosphorylation consensus sites would lead to impaired association of the Src homology-2 domains (SH2) of p85α with IRS-1 at these sites and lowered IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity. This is consistent with the decrease in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity that Almind et al. (14Almind K. Inoue G. Pedersen O. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 2569-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) observed in 32D(IR) cells expressing the full-length IRS-1 G972R molecule. However, no significant decrease in insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the full-length IRS-1 G972R molecule was observed compared with the wild type molecule, suggesting that phosphorylation at other sites was likely intact and demonstrating the importance of studies like this one using small recombinant fragments from IRS-1 to determine the specific effect of the G972R polymorphism. Our results are in agreement with several other studies in muscle and β-cells that have shown decreased binding of p85α to IRS-1 G972R, reduced IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity, and decreased glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphorylation in these tissues. Taken together with the present study, these studies suggest that the IRS-1 G972R polymorphism might be contributing to insulin resistance by impairing the ability of insulin to activate the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase/Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3 signaling pathway in these two vitally important insulin-sensitive tissues. This would lead to multiple defects in processes including glucose transport, glucose transporter translocation and glycogen synthesis in muscle (15Hribal M.L. Federici M. Porzio O. Lauro D.

Because Type 2 diabetes involves other tissues including liver, fat, and brain, it would also be interesting to investigate the effect of this polymorphism in these other tissues. In addition to decreased phosphorylation of the fragment, we found that the IRS-1-(925–1008) G972R fragment associates with the insulin receptor directly and inhibits autophosphorylation of the receptor. We have shown that this association occurs between residues 966 and 1271 of the insulin receptor, the region of the receptor β-subunit that includes the tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation domain, and between residues 950 and 986 of IRS-1. Normally after ligand binding and autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor, IRS-1 associates with the receptor via the PH and PTB domains in the N terminus of IRS-1 (Fig. 1). The PH domain targets the molecule to the plasma membrane, and the PTB domain associates with phosphorylated Tyr960 in the juxtamembrane region of the receptor (22White M.F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: s2-s17Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). This interaction is transient and occurs with low affinity; therefore it is unexpected that the IRS-1-(925–1008) fragment containing the G972R polymorphism and lacking both the PH and PTB domains associates with the insulin receptor kinase domain, a region not normally involved in insulin receptor/IRS-1 interactions, with such high affinity. We have also demonstrated that the IRS-1-(925–1008) G972R fragment is able to inhibit autophosphorylation of the closely related IGF-1R, which also signals through IRS-1. It is reasonable to speculate that the mechanism of inhibition would be similar to that for the insulin receptor because the tyrosine kinase domains of the two receptors are highly homologous. The question remains as to whether the reduced phosphorylation seen is associated with a direct effect of the G972R polymorphism because of conformational changes in IRS-1 or a change in charge state related to the substitution of glycine 972 for arginine or whether it is associated with an indirect effect of the polymorphism because of inhibition of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation by IRS-1 G972R. The G972R polymorphism may interfere with the ATP-binding site at Lys1018 in the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domain. The substituted Arg972 in IRS-1 has charge characteristics similar to those of Lys1018, and it has been shown previously that if ATP binding is abolished at this site, tyrosine kinase activity is lost (23Chou C.K.

Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It seems likely that all of these mechanisms may contribute. Furthermore, this indicates how, even in a heterozygous state, the G972R polymorphism may alter insulin sensitivity. Co-crystallization of the IRS-1-(925–1008) G972R fragment with the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domain would give detailed information about the altered interaction between the two proteins and would provide insight into how the G972R polymorphism enhances the association. Because of the ability to bind with high affinity to the insulin receptor and to inhibit insulin receptor and IGF-1R autophosphorylation, the IRS-1-(925–1008) G972R peptide could also be a potentially useful tool to inhibit receptor function in vivo. Type 2 diabetes is a complex polygenic disorder, and the true extent of the genes involved is unclear (26Almind K. Doria A. Kahn C.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Polymorphisms that cause only a modest change in gene or protein function may become clinically significant when expressed along with other genetic or acquired defects. Genetic alterations have been reported in numerous insulin-signaling proteins in addition to IRS-1 including the insulin receptor (27Krook A. O'Rahilly S. Bailliere's Clin. Endocrinol.

Therefore the IRS-1 G972R polymorphism may be just one contributing factor of many that predispose an individual to Type 2 diabetes. Taken together, these data indicate that the primary defect of the G972R polymorphism is the increased association of IRS-1 G972R with the insulin receptor and the inhibition of insulin receptor autophosphorylation leading to reduced downstream signaling along the PI 3-kinase pathway. These effects in combination with changes in other genes encoding insulin-signaling proteins may contribute to global insulin resistance.

Mutations in these sites significantly reduced C-P4H tetramer assembly, with the a domain mutations generally having the greater effect. When the a or a′ domain mutations were combined with the b′ domain mutation I272W tetramer assembly was further reduced, and more than 95% of the assembly was abolished when mutations in the three domains were combined. The data indicate that binding sites in three PDI domains, a, b′, and a′, contribute to efficient C-P4H tetramer assembly.

The role of PDI in this tetramer is to keep the highly insoluble α subunits in solution and in a catalytically active, nonaggregated conformation (6Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), which by itself is capable of binding short peptide substrates. We have recently identified a putative hydrophobic pocket in the b′ domain by structural homology modeling and sequence alignments and shown by site-directed mutagenesis that this pocket contains several residues that are important for the binding of short peptide substrates (15Pirneskoski A.

The present work set out to study the role of the primary substrate binding site in the b′ domain of PDI in C-P4H tetramer assembly and activity. Surprisingly, no mutations in any of the b′ domain residues previously shown to be important in peptide binding prevented C-P4H tetramer assembly or reduced the enzyme activity. We therefore used sequence conservation among the thioredoxin family to identify residues that might form substrate binding sites in the a and a′ domains. Efficient assembly of an active C-P4H tetramer was found to be dependent on interaction sites in three PDI domains, a, b′, and a′, and the same sites were also found to play a role in the assembly of a Caenorhabditis elegans α subunit-human PDI C-P4H dimer. The relative importance of each site for PDI-protein interactions was greatly dependent on the nature of the interaction partner, and there was clear evidence of cooperativity between the three binding sites in PDI.

PDI mutants were generated on these vectors using site-directed mutagenesis performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as recommended by the manufacturer. All of the plasmids generated were sequenced to ensure that there were no errors in the cloned genes. Generation of Baculoviruses for PDI Mutants and Expression of the Recombinant Proteins in Insect Cells—The recombinant PDI mutant plasmids generated were cotransfected into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells with a modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BaculoGold; PharMingen) by calcium phosphate transfection (23Crossen R. Gruenwald S. Baculovirus Expression Vector System: Instruction Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). The resultant viral pools were collected 4 days later, amplified twice, and used for recombinant protein production. Other recombinant baculoviruses used in this work coded for the human C-P4H α(I) and α(II) subunits, the human PDI/β subunit (6Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Sf9 cells were cultured in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioClear) at 27 °C as monolayers. To produce recombinant proteins, insect cells seeded at a density of 0.7–1.5 × 106/ml were infected with the recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of 5. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection; washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4; homogenized in a 0.1 m glycine, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.01 m Tris buffer, pH 7.8, supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, using 1/20 of the original culture volume; and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Analysis of Recombinant PDI Mutants and C-P4H Tetramers Expressed in Insect Cells—Aliquots of the Triton X-100-soluble insect cell supernatants were analyzed by denaturing 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, nondenaturing 8% PAGE, and Western blotting using an anti-PDI antibody (32Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of wild-type and mutant C-P4H tetramers were compared by densitometry of the Coomassie-stained nondenaturing PAGE using a GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). Triton X-100-soluble samples corresponding to PDI and five mutants were transferred from SDS-PAGE to a ProBlott™ membrane (Applied Biosystems) by electroblotting and stained with Coomassie Blue. The samples were excised from the blot, and their N-terminal sequence was analyzed in a ProciseTM 492 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Enzyme Activity Assay—The P4H activity of the Triton X-100-soluble insect cell fractions was assayed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (24Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla ̈ R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), using a synthetic peptide (PPG)10 (Peptide Institute) as the substrate. Km values for (PPG)10 were determined by varying its concentration while the concentrations of the other reaction components were kept constant. Protein Expression in E. coli and Purification—Protein production was carried out in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS grown in LB medium at 37 °C and induced at an A600 of 0.3 for 3 h with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Cell lysis was carried out by freeze-thawing, and the proteins were purified using BD TALON™ single step columns (BD Biosciences). All of the proteins were >95% pure in SDS-PAGE analysis, with the minor impurities being at a low level of degradation as seen in E. coli. The concentration of each protein was determined spectrophotometrically using a calculated absorption coefficient of PDI (45,040 m–1 cm–1; Mr 56,386) at 280 nm. Cross-linking and Protease Sensitivity Assay—Cell extracts from E. coli were prepared by freeze-thawing. Bolton-Hunter 125I labeling of Δ-somatostatin (AGSKNFFWKTFSS) was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences), and cross-linking was performed using the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl glutarate (Sigma), as described for Δ-somatostatin or “scrambled” RNase (17Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The protease sensitivity assay was carried out by adding proteinase K (0–50 μg/ml) or V8 (0–100 μg/ml) to 2 μl of lysates in a total volume of 10 μl and then incubated on ice for 20 min. After that, 0.5 μl of 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added, and the samples were run on a denaturing 12.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and Western blotted using an anti-PDI antibody (Stressgen). The stringent condition used for screening all of the mutants was 20 μg/ml proteinase K. Circular Dichroism Spectrum Analyses—Far UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J600 spectrophotometer. All scans were collected at 25 °C as averages of eight scans, using a cell with a path length of 0.1 cm, a scan speed of 20 nm/min, a spectral bandwidth of 1.0 nm, and a time constant of 1 s. The maximal high tension voltage was 750 V. All spectra were corrected for blanks run with no protein added. Point Mutations in the Substrate Binding Site in the b′ Domain of PDI Do Not by Themselves Impair C-P4H Tetramer Assembly—We have recently identified several residues in the b′ domain that are important for the binding of peptide substrates (15Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M. Williamson R.A. Byrne L. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Kivirikko K.I. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10374-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Replacement of Ile272 by alanine, tryptophan, asparagine, glutamine, or leucine in the individual b′ domain and full-length PDI greatly impaired binding of the small peptides Δ-somatostatin and mastoparan, whereas replacement of the residues Leu242, Leu244, and Phe258 by various amino acids also reduced peptide binding, but to a lesser extent (15Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M. Williamson R.A. Byrne L. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Kivirikko K.I. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10374-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The I272W mutation had the greatest effect on binding affinity, and in addition to the short peptide substrates it also reduced the affinity of the full-length PDI to “scrambled” RNase (15Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M. Williamson R.A. Byrne L. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Kivirikko K.I. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10374-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the mutation of any of these four residues or the spatially adjacent residue Ser256 in the full-length PDI polypeptide would impair the assembly of a C-P4H tetramer. Recombinant full-length PDI polypeptides containing the single point mutation L242W, L244W, F258A, F258W, I272A, I272W, or S256D in the b′ domain (Fig. 1) were expressed together with the human C-P4H α(I) or α(II) subunits in insect cells. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, homogenized in a buffer containing Triton X-100, and centrifuged. Assembly of a recombinant human type I [α(I)]2β2 or type II [α(II)]2β2 C-P4H tetramer was then analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE of the Triton X-100-soluble proteins (Fig. 2), and P4H activity was assayed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo-[1-14C]glutarate (Table I). Surprisingly, none of the b′ domain mutations tested was found to inhibit C-P4H tetramer assembly (e.g. see Fig. 2, lanes 1–3), and none caused a marked reduction in P4H activity (Table I). In fact, the L244W, F258A, I272A, and S256D mutations significantly increased the amount of activity generated (Table I), coinciding with an increased amount of the corresponding enzyme tetramers (e.g. see Fig. 2, lane 3). The higher amounts of C-P4H tetramers were not due to increased expression levels of the mutant PDI polypeptides, since no differences were seen relative to those of the mutant and wild-type PDI polypeptides in SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Western blotting with an anti-PDI antibody (e.g. see Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4). In addition, the Km values of the type I and type II S256D mutant C-P4H tetramers for the (PPG)10 peptide-substrate were comparable with those of the wild-type enzymes (Table I); hence, their higher P4H activities were not due to increased affinity for the substrate. The data thus show that none of the b′ domain residues previously shown to be critical for peptide binding by PDI is by itself essential for C-P4H tetramer assembly, and surprisingly, that certain mutations in these residues lead to more efficient assembly in insect cells.Table ICollagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity of Triton X-100-soluble proteins from insect cells expressing the α(I) or α(II) subunit with the wild-type PDI/β subunit or the PDI b′ domain single point mutantsPDI or b′ domain point mutant expressedWith α(I) subunitWith α(II) subunitActivityaValues are given in dpm/100 μg of extractable cell protein (mean ± S.D. for at least three experiments) and as percentages of the value obtained with the wild-type PDI.

A filled arrowhead indicates the migration position of the mutant PDIs, and an open arrowhead shows that of the polypeptides lacking domain a. Bands corresponding to the position of mature PDI in A (lanes 1, 4, 6 and 9) in B (lane 6), and in C (lane 3) were N-terminally sequenced, and in all cases, the sequence of the first seven amino acids was found to be that of mature recombinant human PDI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study further the effect of the PDI I272W mutation on the assembly properties of C-P4H, we expressed a PDIbb′a′c domain construct and the corresponding I272W mutant together with the α(I) or α(II) subunits in insect cells. Consistent with previous observations (18Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W. Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Kivirikko K.I. Koivunen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11287-11293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), no activity was generated when either the wild-type or the mutant domain construct was co-expressed with the α(I) subunit (Table I). The amount of activity obtained when the bb′a′c construct was co-expressed with the α(II) subunit was 35% of that obtained with the full-length PDI, which was again consistent with previous observations (18Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W. Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Kivirikko K.I. Koivunen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11287-11293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas the activity generated with the I272W mutant bb′a′c construct was only 3% (Table I). The wild-type and mutant bb′a′c constructs were expressed at equal levels (Fig. 3A, lanes 10 and 11), and a faint band corresponding to an enzyme tetramer could be detected in nondenaturing PAGE by Western blotting (data not shown). The data therefore indicate that when the PDI a domain is missing, the b′ domain residue Ile272 becomes critical for C-P4H tetramer assembly. Residues in the a and a′ Domains of PDI Are Important for Efficient C-P4H Tetramer Assembly—Since mutations of the critical residues identified at the primary substrate binding site in the b′ domain of the full-length PDI had no inhibitory effect on C-P4H tetramer assembly, there must be additional binding sites in PDI that contribute to assembly. We have shown previously that the b′ and a′ domains of PDI fulfill the minimum requirement for functioning as the C-P4H β subunit in combination with the α(II) subunit but that the addition of the a and b domains enhances tetramer formation and is essential for PDI to form a tetramer with the α(I) subunit (18Pirneskoski A.

These results, combined with the observations that the isolated a and a′ domains are able to function as efficient catalysts of thiol-disulfide exchange reactions in peptides and proteins (25Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), suggest that both the a and a′ domains contain substrate binding sites. To identify such potential sites, we used sequence homology conservation among the members of the thioredoxin family to identify putative protein-protein interaction sites in the two catalytic domains a and a′. The crystal structures of the periplasmic thiol-disulfide oxidase DsbA from a variety of bacterial species reveal a hydrophobic binding groove leading to the active site (26Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 27Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C. Zander T. Martin J.L.

Biol. 1997; 268: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This groove includes a conserved cis-proline lying under the active site -CXXC- sequence, which is implicated not only in substrate binding by DsbA but also by other superfamily members including thioredoxin and glutaredoxin (29Doublie ́ S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 30Nordstrand K. A ̊slund F. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment of the thioredoxin-like domain of the DsbAs and the catalytic domains of the human PDI family allowed the identification of the residues in PDI equivalent to those that form the hydrophobic binding groove in DsbA. Based on these analyses, Leu42, Pro83, Ile85, Tyr99, and Trp111 were identified in the a domain of PDI, and Leu386, Pro424, Leu426, Tyr440, and Phe452 in the corresponding positions in the a′ domain (Fig. 1). The Pro83 and Pro424 sites in PDI were not investigated in this study, since mutations in cis-proline residues will most probably result in structural changes in the protein. Mutations were performed in the remaining positions to try to partially occupy these putative substrate binding sites (Fig. 1), as had been done previously for the binding site in the b′ domain (15Pirneskoski A.

Despite its physiologic importance, no studies to date have examined the regulation of CysLT1R signaling or trafficking. We have established model systems for analyzing recombinant human CysLT1R and found regulation of internalization and signaling of the CysLT1R to be unique among G protein-coupled receptors. Rapid and profound LTD4-stimulated internalization was observed for the wild type (WT) CysLT1R, whereas a C-terminal truncation mutant exhibited impaired internalization yet signaled robustly, suggesting a region within amino acids 310–321 as critical to internalization. Although overexpression of WT arrestins significantly increased WT CysLT1R internalization, expression of dominant-negative arrestins had minimal effects, and WT CysLT1R internalized in murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking both arrestin-2 and arrestin-3, suggesting that arrestins are not the primary physiologic regulators of CysLT1Rs. Instead, pharmacologic inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) was shown to profoundly inhibit CysLT1R internalization while greatly increasing both phosphoinositide (PI) production and calcium mobilization stimulated by LTD4 yet had almost no effect on H1 histamine receptor internalization or signaling. Moreover, mutation of putative PKC phosphorylation sites within the CysLT1R C-tail (CysLT1RS(313–316)A) reduced receptor internalization, increased PI production and calcium mobilization by LTD4, and significantly attenuated the effects of PKC inhibition. These findings characterized the CysLT1R as the first G protein-coupled receptor identified to date in which PKC is the principal regulator of both rapid agonist-dependent internalization and rapid agonist-dependent desensitization.

CysLT type 2 receptor is expressed in leukocytes, heart, and brain, and binds LTD4 and LTC4 with equal affinity. Although no specific CysLT type 2 receptor antagonists currently exist, CysLT1R antagonists have been established as effective anti-asthma drugs (10Peters S.P. J. Allergy Clin.

This lack of studies is due primarily to difficulties in expressing recombinant CysLT1R in mammalian cells (6Lynch K.R. O'Neill G.P. Liu Q. Im D.S. Sawyer N. Metters K.M. Coulombe N. Abramovitz M.

Although expression of recombinant CysLT1R in HEK 293T cells appears useful for high-throughput screening of potential CysLT1R ligands using an automated assay of intracellular calcium mobilization (7Sarau H.M.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), features of the CysLT1R beyond basic pharmacologic receptor-ligand interactions remain uncharacterized.Understanding the mechanisms by which the responsiveness of a given G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) is regulated not only can provide insight into the functional impact of the receptor in physiologic and disease states but also can identify regulatory molecules as potential therapeutic targets (13Koch W.J. J. Card Fail. 2002; 8: S526-S531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 14Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Penn R.B. Pronin A.P. Benovic J.L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For example, the responsiveness of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) is tightly regulated by phosphorylation of the receptor by GPCR kinases (GRKs) and the subsequent binding of arrestin proteins. GRK-mediated phosphorylation partially uncouples the β2AR from Gs and promotes the binding of arrestins to the receptor, which in turn sterically inhibits β2AR-Gs interaction while promoting receptor internalization into endocytotic vesicles. Sensitivity of the β2AR to this mode of regulation may explain a differential efficacy of β-agonists among airway cells that influences airway function and response to therapy (16McGraw D.W. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and may contribute to the pathology of chronic heart failure, in which β2AR hyporesponsiveness is associated with elevated GRK levels in cardiac myocytes (17Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Rockman H.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 237-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Importantly, cardiac expression of a GRK2 “minigene” that effectively inhibits GRK2 activity can reverse β2AR hyporesponsiveness and the pathologic phenotype in animal models of heart failure (18White D.C.

Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), thereby establishing the utility of targeting GRK2, and possibly other GPCR regulatory molecules, in disease therapy. Moreover, differential sensitivity to GRK/arrestin-mediated regulation seems to explain, in part, differences in the signaling capacity and functional effects among GPCRs in a given cell type. The prostaglandin E2 EP2 receptor, which is resistant to GRK-mediated phosphorylation and arrestin binding, is much more efficacious than the β2AR in stimulating cAMP production in analyses of both recombinant and endogenous receptors (21Penn R.B. Pascual R.M. Kim Y.-M. Mundell S.J. Krymskaya V.P. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32648-32656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The enhanced signaling capacity of EP2 receptors in human airway smooth muscle likely contributes to the significantly greater effect of prostaglandin E2 (relative to β-agonists) in modulating growth, migration, and contraction of human airway smooth muscle (22Goncharova E.A.

Results demonstrated that the CysLT1R undergoes rapid agonist-dependent internalization, yet, unlike most GPCRs characterized to date, this effect appeared largely GRK- and arrestin-independent. Instead, internalization and desensitization were most dramatically affected by PKC activity, characterizing the CysLT1R as the only GPCR examined to date in which both agonist-dependent internalization and desensitization are primarily PKC-dependent phenomena.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—FuGENE 6 transfection reagent and all reagents used for cloning were purchased from Roche Applied Science.

A signal sequence (26Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted upstream of the 3-FLAG cassette in pcDNA3–3FLAG, and this plasmid was used to generate all WT and mutant CysLT1R clones. The open reading frame encoding the human CysLT1R in HG55 was amplified by PCR and inserted in-frame immediately downstream of the 3-FLAG cassette. C-terminal truncation mutants CysLT1R321stop, CysLT1R309stop, and CysLT1R300stop, as well as CysLT1RS(313–316)A, in which serines 313, 315, and 316 were mutated to alanines, were similarly generated by PCR cloning with specific antisense primers. Generation of pcDNA3 plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged human H1 histamine receptor (H1 HR) in pcDNA3 was described previously (27Iwata K. Luo J. Penn R.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2197-2204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).The sequence encoding the CysLT1R open reading frame, the signal sequence motif, and the 3-FLAG epitope were PCR-amplified and cloned into the shuttle vector pAdEGI to make pAdEGI-CysLT1R. Recombinant adenovirus was generated by co-transfection of pAdEGI-CysLT1R DNA with ψ5 viral DNA as described previously (25Johns D.C. Marx R. Mains R.E. O'Rourke B. Marban E. J Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting virus, AdEGI-CysLT1R, was plaque-purified, expanded, and purified by two rounds of cesium chloride density centrifugation followed by exhaustive dialysis against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5% w/v sucrose. Viral particle numbers were determined by dilution in 0.1% SDS followed by measuring absorbance at 260 nm, and viral titers were determined by plaque analysis on 911 cells. The particle to infective/particle ratio was between 25 and 45 for all of the viruses used. Sequence fidelity of all of the clones was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing.Cell Culture, Transfection, Infection—HEK 293 cells and COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated into 60-mm dishes 1 day prior to transfection so that they were 65–75% confluent immediately prior to transfection. All transfections were carried out using 10 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent and 3 μg of total DNA. Eighteen h after transfection, cells were harvested and plated on 6- or 24-well plates for subsequent immunoblot analysis, receptor sequestration ELISA, analysis of phosphoinositide (PI) production, or onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips for immunocytochemical analysis of receptor subcellular distribution. For transfection of MEFs with pcDNA3-FLAGβ2AR, 20 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 500 μl of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) were mixed with 8 μg of pcDNA3-FLAGβ2AR, and the mixture was added dropwise to MEFs seeded in 60-mm dishes; the cells were passaged 24 h later into 24-well plates. For infection of MEFs using AdEGI-CysLT1R, MEFs were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum medium lacking antibiotics. 1 × 1010 particles of CysLT1R adenovirus plus 5 × 109 particles of receptor plasmid VgRXR adenovirus, or 5 × 109 particles of VgRXR alone, were combined with 500,000 cells and were plated into 60-mm dishes. Fifteen h later, cells were again harvested, washed, and plated into 24-well plates in the presence of 10 μm (final concentration) ponasterone to induce expression. Twenty-four h later, receptor internalization was assessed by ELISA as described below.Receptor Internalization—Agonist-induced changes in cell surface receptor distribution were measured by ELISA. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells in 24-well plates were washed once and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in plain DMEM with various inhibitors or vehicle (typically 0.03% Me2SO). After pretreatment, cells were stimulated with LTD4, histamine, isoproterenol, or vehicle (typically 0.05% EtOH) for 0–30 min. The medium was aspirated, and cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed three times with Tris-buffered saline, and then blocked for 45 min with 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with a 1:1200 dilution of an anti-Flag M2 antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, washed three times with Tris-buffered saline, and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase substrate at 37 °C until adequate color development was visible. Reactions were stopped by adding 0.1 ml from each sample well into 0.1 ml of 0.4 m NaOH, and the sample absorbances were read at 405 nm using a Bio-Rad microplate reader and Microplate Manager software.Treatment of cells with 10 mm l-cysteine throughout the course of cell treatment with LTD4, in experiments assessing either receptor internalization or PI production, had no effect on results, suggesting that the metabolism of LTD4 in culture media was not of consequence. Experimental results were also qualitatively similar whether cells were maintained in serum-containing or serum-free medium for 18 h prior to acute pretreatment and treatment. Whenever possible, the effect of experimental variables (e.g. receptor mutations, pharmacologic inhibition) was tested in assays performed under optimally matched conditions (e.g. simultaneously performed using same passage or transfected cells, same prepared reagents) to minimize intra- and inter-experimental variability.Radioligand Binding—Binding of [3H]LTD4 (183 Ci/mmol) to membrane fractions prepared from COS-1 cells expressing WT CysLT1R was performed by incubating membranes in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm CaCl2, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 20 mm l-penicillamine, and 0–1.5 nm [3H]LTD4, for 60 min at room temperature, followed by filtration on Whatman GF/C filters using a Brandel Cell Harvester and five 5-ml washes with 10 mm HEPES, 0.01% bovine serum albumin. Nonspecific binding was determined using 10 μm MK-571.Assay of Phosphoinositide Generation—Cells passaged into 24-well plates as described above were loaded with 2 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol for 18 h. Cells were then washed briefly with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated in DMEM containing 5 mm LiCl plus various inhibitors or vehicle for 15 min, and then stimulated with LTD4, histamine, or vehicle for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by replacing medium with cold 20 mm formic acid. The inositol and PI fractions were separated by anion exchange chromatography, mixed with Ultima Gold and Ultima Flo AF scintillation fluid (Packard), respectively, and counted. To normalize for loading variability among wells, PI production was calculated as PI/(PI + inositol), and values were reported as fold basal (vehicle-stimulated) production, as described previously (28Sterne-Marr R. Tesmer J.J. Day P.W. Stracquatanio R.P. Cilente J.A. O'Connor K.E. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol.

All of the calcium measurements were carried out at 37 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1.2 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4) using a dual excitation fluorescence photomultiplier system (IonOptix, Milton, MA). The ratio of intensities of fura-2 emissions at excitation wavelengths 340 and 380 nm was calculated every second, and the intracellular calcium concentration (nm) was calculated by extrapolation from a calibration curve, as described previously (29Deshpande D.A. Walseth T.F. Panettieri R.A. Kannan M.S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 452-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated for 15 min with either vehicle (0.03% Me2SO) or 10 μm Bis I and then were stimulated with agonist (1 μm LTD4 or 1 μm histamine), and changes in the intracellular calcium concentrations were recorded for 3–4 min. Calcium flux upon agonist stimulation was calculated by subtracting the mean basal intracellular calcium concentration from that of the peak intracellular calcium concentration elicited by agonist. Comparable expression of WT CysLT1R and CysLT1RS(313–316)A was confirmed by the immunoblotting of lysates from cells plated in parallel in 6-well plates.Analysis of PKC Translocation—COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3wtCysLT1R or vector control or were co-transfected with a construct encoding PKCβ-GFP plus either pcDNA3wtCysLT1R or pcDNA3 vector and subsequently passaged into 60-mm dishes. Cells were serum-starved and then stimulated for 20 min with vehicle, 100 nm LTD4, or 100 nm PMA. Cells were harvested by scraping them into 500 μl of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were passed through a 26-gauge needle three times and were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resultant supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction, and the pellet (crude membrane fraction) was resuspended in 125 μl of homogenization buffer containing 0.1% Triton. 25 μl of each fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots were probed with anti-PKCα or anti-GFP antibody.Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Immunoblotting—Visualization of the agonist-induced changes in CysLT1R distribution was performed on cells plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips using a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope, as described previously for EP receptors (21Penn R.B. Pascual R.M. Kim Y.-M. Mundell S.J. Krymskaya V.P. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32648-32656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of WT and mutant CysLT1R expression was performed by harvesting cells and scraping them into Laemmli buffer (0.75 m Tris, pH 6.5, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 4% SDS). For samples generated for radioligand binding studies and analysis of membrane/cytosolic distribution of CysLT1R, cells were scraped into homogenization buffer (as described above) and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. To generate membrane and cytosolic fractions, whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was saved and the pellet resuspended in homogenization buffer. For radioligand binding studies, resuspended pellets of the 30,000 × g fraction were centrifuged a second time and resuspended in binding buffer. For immunoblot analysis, protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and then probed with the appropriate antibodies. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONInitial attempts to generate a useful recombinant CysLT1R produced constructs that either expressed poorly or, when expressed, resulted in proteins that migrated at too small a size (∼35 kDa), suggesting either folding problems or difficulties in processing through the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi (data not shown). Ultimately a construct encoding an N-terminal 3-FLAG epitope and an upstream signal sequence to facilitate endoplasmic reticulum processing (26Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generated that expressed well in both COS-1 and HEK 293 cells and migrated at the predicted size (Fig. 1A). Multiple bands ranging from ∼45 to 52 kDa in size were detected (as well as a possible dimer at ∼90 kDa), suggesting the existence of multiple glycosylation sites. Importantly, antibodies against the N-terminal FLAG epitope and the C terminus of the human CysLT1R identified the same size bands (see below). Radioligand binding analysis of this construct expressed in COS-1 revealed saturable binding of [3H]LTD4 (Bmax = 450 fmol/mg protein) at levels ∼10-fold higher than that reported for the original HG55 clone (6Lynch K.R. O'Neill G.P. Liu Q. Im D.S. Sawyer N. Metters K.M. Coulombe N. Abramovitz M. Figueroa D.J. Zeng Z. Connolly B.M. Bai C. Austin C.P. Chateauneuf A. Stocco R. Greig G.M. Kargman S. Hooks S.B.

Comparable levels of CysLT1R were expressed among groups in which additional constructs were co-expressed (see supplemental materials). In assays of agonist-stimulated PI production (Fig. 1C), signaling capacity of wt CysLT1R was robust (∼5-fold of basal (vehicle-stimulated)), albeit less than that mediated by the H1 histamine receptor (H1 HR).Exposure of COS-1 cells expressing wt CysLT1R to LTD4 caused a rapid internalization of receptor as demonstrated by the loss of cell surface binding of anti-FLAG antibody in ELISA experiments (Fig. 2A) and as suggested by punctate aggregation of receptor, visualized by immunocytochemistry, following the addition of LTD4 (Fig. 2B). In unstimulated cells, CysLT1R was visualized primarily at the plasma membrane, although some puncta were frequently observed, suggesting that the tendency of receptors to internalize in the absence of agonist. Co-expression of CysLT1R with either arrestin-2 or arrestin-3 increased LTD4-stimulated internalization (Fig. 2C), suggesting a role for arrestins in mediating agonist-dependent internalization similar to th"

This polypeptide was thus renamed the MCH-1 receptor. A second MCH receptor (MCH-2 receptor) has also been identified (7An S. Cutler G. Zhao J.J. Huang S.G. Tian H. Li W. Liang L. Rich M. Bakleh A.

Lahaye C. Suply T. Rovere-Jovene C. Rodriguez M. Nicolas J.P. Beauverger P. Cardinaud B. Galizzi J.P. Fauchere J.L. Nahon J.L. Boutin J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Even before identification of the MCH receptors a clear role for MCH in feeding and energy balance and homeostasis had been established (1Qu D. Ludwig D.S. Gammeltoft S. Piper M. Pelleymounter M.A. Cullen M.J. Mathes W.F. Przypek R. Kanarek R. Maratos-Flier E. Nature. 1996; 380: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). A solid body of genetic and pharmacological evidence now supports a role for MCH and the MCH-1 receptor in the modulation of food intake and energy expenditure. Key data derive from the genetic ablation of both MCH (13Shimada M. Tritos N.A. Lowell B.B. Flier J.S. Maratos-Flier E. Nature. 1998; 396: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar) and the MCH-1 receptor (14Chen Y. Hu C. Hsu C.K. Zhang Q. Bi C. Asnicar M. Hsiung H.M. Fox N. Slieker L.J. Yang D.D. Heiman M.L.

Mice lacking the MCH-1 receptor have been reported to be hyperphagic (14Chen Y. Hu C. Hsu C.K. Zhang Q. Bi C. Asnicar M. Hsiung H.M. Fox N. Slieker L.J. Yang D.D. Heiman M.L. Shi Y.

Studies also indicate that acute and chronic administration of MCH enhances food intake and body weight (16Della-Zuana O. Presse F. Ortola C. Duhault J. Nahon J.L. Levens N. Int. J. Obesity Relat. Metab. Disord. 2002; 26: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and that overexpression of MCH in transgenic mice leads to obesity and insulin resistance (17Ludwig D.S. Tritos N.A. Mastaitis J.W. Kulkarni R. Kokkotou E. Elmquist J. Lowell B. Flier J.S. Maratos-Flier E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). A role for the MCH-2 receptor in these effects is unlikely because genetic evidence indicates that mice do not express a functional form of this receptor (18Tan C.P. Sano H. Iwaasa H. Pan J. Sailer A.W. Hreniuk D.L. Feighner S.D. Palyha O.C. Pong S.S. Figueroa D.J. Austin C.P. Jiang M.M. Yu H. Ito J. Ito M. Ito M. Guan X.M. MacNeil D.J. Kanatani A. Van der Ploeg L.H. Howard A.D. Genomics. 2002; 79: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the distribution of the MCH-1 receptor in the central nervous system (19Hervieu G.J. Cluderay J.E. Harrison D. Meakin J. Maycox P. Nasir S. Leslie R.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1194-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) also suggests that antagonists at the MCH-1 receptor might provide a treatment for obesity (for review, see Refs. 20Griffond B. Baker B.I. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 213: 233-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and 21Collins C.A. Kym P.R. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2003; 4: 386-394PubMed Google Scholar). High throughput screening efforts have led to the identification of small molecule MCH-1 receptor antagonists with diverse structural features and drug-like properties. In vivo results with two of these antagonists indicate efficacy in several animal models of body weight regulation and feeding behavior (21Collins C.A. Kym P.R. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2003; 4: 386-394PubMed Google Scholar). At least when expressed in heterologous cell lines, the MCH-1 receptor is able to regulate signal transduction through both Gi- and Gq-coupled pathways (2Ba ̈chner D. Kreienkamp H. Weise C. Buck F. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3Shimomura Y. Mori M. Sugo T. Ishibashi Y. Abe M. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Nishimura O. Sumino Y. Fujino M. Biochem.

Despite this, little is known about the regulation of this receptor. GPCRs generally do not exist in isolation, and there is increasing information on proteins that interact with GPCRs and by so doing alter their cellular distribution or function (22Premont R.T. Hall R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 23Milligan G. White J.H. Trends Pharmacol.

The intracellular C-terminal tail of GPCRs has been particularly well studied in this regard and interacting proteins identified by the application of both proteomic (26Becamel C. Gavarini S.

We have previously used the MCH-1 receptor C-terminal tail as the bait in yeast two-hybrid screens to identify interactions with a zinc finger protein named MCH-1 receptor-interacting zinc finger protein (MIZIP) (30Ba ̈chner D. Kreienkamp H.J. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Using the same approach we now report the interactions of the MCH-1 receptor with the actin and intermediate filament-binding protein, periplakin (PPL) (31Leung C.L. Green K.J. Liem R.K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 37-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). PPL is a 1,756-amino acid polypeptide that is expressed widely and at considerable levels in both rodent and human brain (32Aho S. McLean W.H. Li K. Uitto J. Genomics. 1998; 48: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Feng G.J. Kellett E. Scorer C.A. Wilde J. White J.H. Milligan G. J. Biol.

Although most actively studied for its role in production of the cornified epithelium in keratinocytes (34Karashima T. Watt F.M. J.

Karashima T. Maatta A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we have previously detailed its capacity to interact with splice variants of the human MOP opioid receptor (32Aho S. McLean W.H. Li K. Uitto J. Genomics. 1998; 48: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We now map the site of interaction of PPL with the MCH-1 receptor and show that this is distinct from the interactions of the MCH-1 receptor with MIZIP. Interactions between PPL and the MCH-1 receptor are selective but do not modulate MCH-1-mediated internalization of the receptor. This interaction does, however, reduce the capacity of the receptor to active G proteins and hence initiate signal transduction. This is the first protein-protein interaction demonstrated to alter agonist-mediated function of the MCH-1 receptor and, as we also demonstrate coexpression of these proteins in specific neurones, is likely to have significance for MCH-mediated functions in vivo. Materials—All materials for tissue culture were supplied by Sigma. [35S]GTPγS (1,250 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Oligonucleotides were purchased from ThermoHybaid (Ulm, Germany). Mouse monoclonal anti-vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) antibody was from Roche Applied Science. Rabbit polyclonal anti-His antiserum was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The sheep anti-GFP antiserum was raised in-house against recombinantly expressed eGFP. The polyclonal sheep anti-PPL antiserum was generated against the C-terminal 208 amino acids of PPL. The mouse monoclonal anti-Myc tag antibody was from Sigma. Both a rabbit polyclonal anti-MCH-1 receptor antiserum (Alpha-diagnostic) and an affinity-purified chicken anti-MCH-1 receptor antibody (Chemikon) were used in various studies. DNA Construction—Generation of a cDNA encoding the C-terminal fragment of the rat (r)MCH-1 receptor (amino acids 299–353) cloned in pAS2 (BD Biosciences) and of murine MIZIP in PcDNA6-His-Myc vector was described by Bächner et al. (30Ba ̈chner D. Kreienkamp H.J. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Similarly, cDNAs encoding C-terminal fragments of rMCH-1 receptor (299–325), rMCH-1 receptor (319–353), human (h)MCH-2 receptor (300–340), and rat somatostatin receptor 5 (295–363) were generated by PCR and cloned into yeast bait vector pAS2. For His tag purification studies, MIZIP was cloned into the bacterial PQE30 expression vector (Qiagen). Generation of the C-terminal fragment of PPL (PPLC), PPLC-GFP, and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged full-length PPL have been described previously (32Aho S. McLean W.H. Li K. Uitto J. Genomics. 1998; 48: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). GST fusions of the hMCH-1 receptor C-terminal domain (amino acids 302–353) and intracellular loops (68–79, 140–158, and 233–252) were generated using PCR-amplified fragments that were subcloned into pGEX-6P1 (Amersham Biosicences). In a similar manner, GST fusions of three C-terminal truncations of the hMCH-1 receptor tail (302–314, 302–327, and 302–340) were PCR amplified using reverse primers containing stop codons at the desired locations, and the cDNAs were subcloned into pGEX-6P1. Production of VSV-G-tagged forms of the hMCH-1 receptor constructs was performed by PCR with a 5′-oligonucleotide primer introducing the VSV-G epitope (YTDIEMNRLGK) adjacent to the sequence of codon 2. For the C-tail truncated mutants, 3′-oligonucleotide primers introducing stop codons after residues 314, 327, and 340 were used in the reactions. PCR fragments were subcloned into PcDNA3.1(+). Equivalent eYFP-tagged versions of the hMCH-1 receptor constructs were made by insertion of the PCR-amplified cDNA fragments (minus stop codons) into plasmid eYFP-Ni (Clontech). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Transformation of the yeast reporter strain CG1945, screening of a human brain cDNA library in the yeast vector pACTII, and the β-galactosidase filter lift assay were performed as described previously (30Ba ̈chner D. Kreienkamp H.J. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. Prior to transfection with plasmid DNA, cells were seeded onto 10-cm2 or 6-cm2 dishes at 50–70% confluence. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). 48 h later cells were harvested by removal of the growth medium, rinsing twice with ice-cold PBS and scraping in 5 ml of PBS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm at 4 °C and then stored at -80 °C until membrane preparation. Preparation of Membranes—Cell pellets were resuspended in TE buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and ruptured with 50 strokes of a Teflon-on-glass homogenizer. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant fraction was passed through a 25-gauge syringe needle 20 times and then centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in TE buffer and stored at -80 °C until use. [35S]GTPγS Binding Assays—Membranes expressing equivalent levels of VSV-G-hMCH-1 full-length receptor (as determined by densitometric scanning of blots of immunodetected receptors using the anti-VSV-G antibody) were incubated with an assay mix (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 50 μm guanosine 5′-diphosphate, 100 nCi of [35S]GTPγS) containing the indicated concentrations of MCH. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and terminated upon addition of 0.5 ml of stop buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl). The membranes were pelleted by a 15-min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C and resuspended in solubilization buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm, NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.25% Nonidet P-40) plus 1% SDS. Samples were precleared with Pansorbin (Calbiochem) for 1 h at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with an antiserum against the C-terminal decapeptide of Gαo1 (38Mullaney I. Milligan G. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1890-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) conjugated to protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with solubilization buffer, and bound [35S]GTPγS was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For equivalent experiments with the IP prostanoid receptor, an antiserum (39Milligan G. Unson C.G. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that detects the C-terminal decapeptide of Gsα was utilized. [Ca2+]i and ERK MAP Kinase Assays—After expression in HEK293 cells of the hMCH-1 receptor in the absence or presence of PPL, the capacity of MCH to elevate [Ca2+]i was monitored in single cells as described by Liu et al. (40Liu S. Carrillo J.J. Pediani J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Total and phosphorylated/activated forms of the ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases in such transfected HEK293 cells were detected by immunoblotting lysates of cells treated for 15 minutes with or without 1 μm MCH with nonselective and phosphospecific antibodies. Cells were washed in situ twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (15 min, 14,000 × g at 4 °C) to remove cell debris, 10 μg of protein/sample was boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer and resolved by 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Total and phosphorylated/activated forms of the ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases in these samples were detected by immunoblotting using antiphospho-ERK and anti-ERK antisera (Cell Signaling) followed by detection with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by ECL (Pierce). Coimmunoprecipitation of His-MIZIP and PPLC-GFP with VSV-G-hMCH-1 Receptor—24 h post-transfection cells from 6-cm2 dishes were split into 6-well plates. The following day the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of agonist (1 μm MCH for VSV-G-hMCH-1 receptor-transfected cells; 1 μm iloprost for equivalent experiments with the VSV-G-IP prostanoid receptor) for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 5% ethylene glycol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Insoluble material was removed by a 15-min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Equalized amounts of protein were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads conjugated to mouse monoclonal anti-VSV-G antibody (Roche Applied Science) or sheep polyclonal anti-GFP antiserum for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were eluted from the beads by the addition of 2× Laemmli buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. A rabbit polyclonal anti-His antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect His-MIZIP. VSV-G-hMCH-1 receptors were detected using the anti-VSV-G antibody. Receptor Internalization Assay-Biotin Labeling—HEK293 cells transfected with the eYFP-tagged hMCH-1 receptors were split into 6-well plates and cultured for a further 24 h. Cells were incubated with or without 1 μm MCH for 60 min and then immediately washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The alcohol groups on the cell surface glycoproteins were oxidized to aldehydes by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C with 10 mm sodium m-periodate in PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2. After further washing with PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min with acetate buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2) containing 1 mm Biotin-LC-Hydrazide (Pierce) that reacts with the newly formed aldehyde groups thereby labeling cell surface glycoproteins with biotin. Labeling was terminated by the removal of the biotin solution and washing with PBS. Cells were then solubilized for receptor immunoprecipitation with the sheep polyclonal anti-GFP antiserum as described earlier. Biotin-labeled receptors were detected using horseradish peroxide-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) and visualized by ECL. Purification of His-tagged Proteins—PQE30 plasmids containing the His fusion inserts of PPLC or MIZIP were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells. A 10-ml starter culture was used to inoculate 400 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C until the culture reached an A600 of 0.5. Expression of the His-tagged proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β,d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h before cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in denaturing lysis buffer containing 6 m urea, and the His-tagged proteins were purified following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Eluted proteins were dialyzed against three changes of PBS containing 5% glycerol at 4 °C over 2 days before storage at -80 °C. Purification of GST Fusion Proteins and GST Pull-down Assays— BL21 cells transformed with the GST fusion constructs were cultured and harvested as described earlier. Pellets were lysed in 20 ml of STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. Dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 5 mm and 10% sarkosyl in STE buffer to a final concentration of 1.5% were added to lysates before sonication for 1 min. The removal of insoluble material was performed by a 15-min centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C. 10% Triton X-100 in STE buffer to a final concentration of 2% and a mixture of protease inhibitors were added to the cleared supernatants before use in GST pull-down assays. For pull-down assays 0.5–5 ml of lysates was incubated with a 100-μl slurry of 50% (v/v) PBS-washed glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 1 min) and washed twice with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 before the addition of 50 μg of the required His-tagged protein in a 1-ml solution of PBS and Triton X-100 containing 5 mm dithiothreitol. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were collected and washed three times with PBS and Triton X-100 solution and eluted in 100 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. Eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the His fusion proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Confocal Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were transfected on coverslips in 6-well plates and the following day were fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 5% sucrose for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized for 10 min in TM buffer (0.15% Triton X-100 and 3% nonfat milk in PBS).

Here we report a role for 3′-nucleotidase and its substrate, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP), in mediating the cellular effects of lithium. Lithium-induced inhibition of growth in yeast cells may be overcome by dose-dependent heterologous expression of human BPNT1.

Lithium has been widely used for over 50 years to treat bipolar disorder (manic depressive disease). Despite its success, the mechanisms by which lithium exerts therapeutic and toxic effects remain unclear. Insights into lithium pharmacology have come with the identification of a signaling phosphatase family whose members are inhibited potently by lithium at subtherapeutic concentrations. Family members have relatively weak overall sequence similarities (<25%) but are unified by a conserved core three-dimensional structure and the conserved pattern motif D(X)nEE(X)nDP(I/L)D(S/G/A)T(X)n-WD(X)11GG (1York J.D.

There are five distinct branches in the complete family of human and mouse signaling phosphatases (Fig. 1A), including inositol monophosphatase (IMP1 and IMP2), inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (INPP1), fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1 and FBP2), BPNT1, and a novel gene product (GenBank™ accession number AY032885) designated LPM (lithium-inhibited Phosphomonoesterase). Overall, it is our hypothesis that the cellular and clinical effects of lithium, both toxic and therapeutic, may be mediated through inhibition of one or more of these family members. Several studies provide evidence that link this family of signaling phosphatases to lithium's action in cells and organisms. Measurements of inositol levels in lithium-treated rat brain (6Allison J.

In yeast, bisphosphate 3′nucleotidase activity (encoded by MET22, also known as HAL2) has been linked to the cellular toxicity of lithium (11Thomas D. Barbey R. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Gen.

Met22/Hal2 is functionally orthologous to BPNT1, having 3′-nucleotidase activity toward 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP) and 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), and it is a key regulator of the sulfur assimilation pathway (Fig. 1B). In this paper we provide evidence that lithium's toxic effects in yeast occur through direct inhibition of 3′-nucleotidase and that down-regulation of PAP synthesis provides an avenue to relieve lithium's cellular effects. Furthermore, through our studies, we have developed a high throughput screening strategy for inhibitors of hBPNT1, which may have important uses in the development of novel therapeutics aimed at improving treatment of bipolar disorder. Overexpression of Human BPNT1 in 3′-Nucleotidase-deficient Yeast—A highly drug-sensitive strain of yeast, YRP1 MATa (15Gray N.S. Wodicka L. Thunnissen A.M. Norman T.C. Kwon S. Espinoza F.H.

A gene replacement strategy was employed as described (2Spiegelberg B.D. Xiong J.-P. Smith J.J. Gu R.F. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13619-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), generating met22::KANMX4. The entire coding region of hBPNT1 was cloned into a copper-inducible yeast expression plasmid pRS316CUP1 to generate pRS316CUP1-HA-hBPNT1, and this plasmid was transformed into the met22-deficient yeast. A single colony of met22::KANMX4 pRS316CUP1-HA-hBPNT1 was used to inoculate 2 ml of complete synthetic media lacking uracil, supplemented with 2% dextrose (CSM/dex/ura–), and incubated overnight at 30 °C. Forty microliters of this culture was used to inoculate 2 ml of CSM/dex/ura– lacking methionine supplemented with an appropriate concentration of CuSO4 and grown to a density of 4 × 107 cells/ml (A600 of 1.3). Cells were harvested by high-velocity reciprocal shaking and glass beads (”bead beating“), and lysates were analyzed by Western blot using affinity purified anti-BPNT1 antibodies as described (2Spiegelberg B.D.

Lithium-induced Growth Inhibition—Wild-type yeast cells (W303 background) were grown in CSM/dex overnight, and 40 μl of them were inoculated into 2 ml of CSM/dex/met– (lacking methionine) or CSM/dex (20 μg/ml methionine) supplemented with various concentrations of LiCl. In the case of met3 and met14 mutants (W303 background), cells were grown in CSM/dex; however, met3 pPAPSS2 or met14 pPAPSS2 was grown in CSM with 2% galactose, which was required to induce the GAL promoter-driven expression of the human PAPS synthetase isoform 2 (hPAPSS2) gene product. Note that cells grown in galactose are highly sensitive to lithium as reported by Masuda et al. (16Masuda C.A. Xavier M.A. Mattos K.A. Galina A. Montero-Lomeli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37794-37801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, CSM/dex was supplemented with 25 mm sodium chlorate (NaClO3). Cultures were harvested at equivalent incubation times, and the optical density was determined with a 600-nm wavelength. For experiments in the met22::KANMX4 pRS316CUP1-HA-hBPNT1, strains were first grown in CSM/dex/ura–, washed extensively in CSM/dex/ura–/met–, and cells were diluted to 3 × 104 cells/ml in CSM/dex/ura–/met– supplemented with various concentrations of CuSO4 and LiCl. In this case, cells were grown in a volume of 175 μl in 96-well round bottom polystyrene plates in an aerated, humidified chamber for 4 days at 30 °C. Plates were read using a Molecular Devices Spectra-Max 340PC384 microplate reader at a 600-nm wavelength (A600). Note that the YPR1 strain of yeast is more sensitive than W303 to lithium-induced growth inhibition (IC50 of 3 mm LiCl versus 50 mm) because of mutations in transporters and membrane lipid biosynthetic genes (15Gray N.S.

Cloning and Analysis of PAPS Synthetases—The fidelity of amplification of each PCR-generated insert was confirmed by fluorescent terminator sequencing (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Biopolymer Facility). hPAPSS2 was subcloned by PCR amplification from expressed sequence tag plasmid AL540583. The open reading frames for yeast MET3 and MET14 were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W303. The amplified products were inserted into pCR2.1 using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The inserts were transferred by conventional molecular biology techniques to a galactose-inducible yeast expression vector. The resulting plasmids and control vector were transformed into met3Δ, met14Δ, or wild-type BY4742 yeast strains obtained through the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (17Winzeler E.A.

Measurement of Intracellular PAP Concentrations—The concentration of PAP in lysates was determined by competition for binding of radiolabeled PAP to the enzyme phenol sulfotransferase (PST), which uses PAP as a cofactor (18Yang Y.-S. Marshall A.D. McPhie P. Guo W.-X.A. Xie X. Chen X. Jakoby W.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of IMAGE Consortium Clone expressed sequence tag 1924316 (mouse PST; accession number AI316417) was amplified by PCR, ligated into the pCR2.1, and subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to create a bacterial expression vector in which PST was downstream of glutathione S-transferase (GST-PST). GST-PST was expressed and purified essentially as described by the manufacturer of the glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences). Residual bacterial PAP and PAPS was removed from GST-PST on the glutathione column with recombinant human BPNT1 (typically 1 μg). For the assay of intracellular PAP concentrations, appropriate yeast strains were grown in CSM/ura– to mid-log phase. The cells were centrifuged and washed extensively in sterile water. The cells were resuspended in CSM/ura–/met– containing methionine (20 μg/ml), lithium, or chlorate as appropriate and then incubated with shaking at 30 °C. At various time points, 2 ml of culture was removed, centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in 1 ml of water. A 250-μl aliquot was then disrupted by bead beating, and the amount of soluble protein in this extract was determined using a Bradford dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The remainder of the washed cells were pelleted and resuspended in 250 μl of 2 n HClO4. This was incubated at 4 °C for 20 min, after which 250 μl of 1.8 n KOH and 0.4 n KHCO3 were added to neutralize and precipitate the HClO4. The extract was centrifuged at 4 °C to remove the debris, and the supernatant was lyophilized using a rotary evaporator. The dried extracts were frozen at –80 °C for no more than 1 week prior to use. Extracts were reconstituted in 100 μl of 200 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and again centrifuged to remove debris. The GST-PST assay was performed by mixing 10 μl of appropriately diluted sample in K-lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 50 mm KCl) with 10 μl of radiolabeled 32P-5′-end-labeled PAP (∼5,000 cpm, prepared as described in Ref. 2Spiegelberg B.D. Xiong J.-P. Smith J.J. Gu R.F. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13619-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Eighty microliters of a reaction mix containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg of GST-PST were added to start the binding reaction. Following a 1-h incubation at room temperature, 20 μl of a 50:50 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose in K-lysis buffer was added. The tubes were incubated with gentle mixing for 10 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing free PAP and one 200-μl wash were removed to a scintillation vial. Radioactivity was converted to percentage of isotope bound. A standard curve was generated for each assay by plotting the percentage bound versus the logarithm of the known PAP concentration. This standard curve was used to back-calculate the PAP concentration in the unknown samples. PAP measurements were shown to be specific by treatment of parallel samples with excess amounts of recombinant Met22 nucleotidase to hydrolyze the PAP, which eliminated >95% of the signal. 3′-Nucleotidase Modulates Lithium-mediated Toxicity—Inhibition of bisphosphate 3′-nucleotidase activity in yeast has been implicated as an integral element of lithium's toxicity and cellular effects (13Murguia J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29029-29033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1998; 16: 7184-7195Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We and others have suggested that the effects of lithium in mammalian systems (toxic and possibly therapeutic) may be mediated through the inhibition of BPNT1 (1York J.D. Ponder J.W. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5149-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 2Spiegelberg B.D. Xiong J.-P. Smith J.J. Gu R.F. York J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16034-16039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To further probe this model, we reasoned that alteration of the levels of 3′-nucleotidase levels in cells should modulate lithium's growth-inhibitory effects in a dose-dependent manner. To this end, we deleted the endogenous copy of 3′-nucleotidase from a drug-sensitive strain of yeast to yield YRP1 met22::KANmx. We then heterologously expressed human BPNT1 under the inducible control of the CUP1 promoter such that increasing doses of copper in the growth media would result in increased BPNT1 transcription. To monitor BPNT1 expression levels, we performed immunoblot analysis of extracts prepared from cells grown at copper concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 μm (Fig. 2A). As is readily apparent, a >10-fold range of hBPNT1 expression levels was observed under these conditions. We then tested the relative sensitivity of these cells to lithium-induced growth inhibition, reasoning that the gain of 3′-nucleotidase activity should confer resistance to lithium. To accomplish this, we monitored the growth of strains in media supplemented with copper ranging between 0.1 and 100 μm and/or 0–40 mm lithium chloride (Fig. 2B). At the lowest level of BPNT1 expression (0.1 μm copper), 50% inhibition of growth occurred at 2.5 mm lithium. Cells expressing increasing levels of BPNT1 were gradually more resistant to lithium toxicity in an exquisitely dose-dependent manner. The differential in IC50 values for lithium was >20-fold at 0.2 and 50 μm copper concentrations (Fig. 2C). As a control, cells were also treated with 40 mm sodium chloride, and no alterations in growth were observed at any copper concentration (data not shown). Cellular Levels of PAP Correlate with Lithium Toxicity—If 3′-nucleotidase inhibition results in the accumulation of PAP in cells and this, in turn, exerts toxic effects, then concomitant down-regulation of PAP synthesis may function to reverse these effects. To demonstrate the concept and specificity of this model, we utilized pharmacological and genetic approaches in budding yeast. A PAP anabolic pathway consists of enzymatic sulfurylation of ATP to create adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS), which is subsequently phosphorylated to create PAPS, the immediate precursor of PAP (Fig. 1B). In yeast, the first step is catalyzed by the ATP sulfurylase Met3, and the second step is catalyzed by the APS kinase Met14 (Fig. 1B). Manipulation of either protein should therefore reduce cellular PAP synthesis. As a first step, we measured levels of PAP under a variety of pharmacological and genetic perturbations. To accurately measure alterations in the cellular PAP levels, a sensitive method to quantify PAP was developed. Following acid lysis to halt enzymatic PAP degradation, the PAP concentrations in neutralized lysates were determined using competition with radiolabeled PAP for binding to mouse phenol sulfotransferase expressed as a fusion to GST (GST-PST). The amount of radioactivity bound to GST-PST was determined by immobilizing the protein to glutathione-Sepharose resin. To internally validate the method, we determined the dissociation constant of PAP with GST-PST. The observed Kd was ∼35 nm (data not shown), consistent with the apparent Kd found for the nonfusion recombinant rat PST (18Yang Y.-S. Marshall A.D. McPhie P. Guo W.-X.A. Xie X. Chen X. Jakoby W.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Note that PAPS is acid-labile, and the cells to be analyzed are lysed in a strong acid solution; therefore, this technique measures the sum of intracellular PAP and PAPS. However, because of its instability, the intracellular concentration of PAPS is thought to be relatively minor compared with the intracellular concentration of PAP (19Jakubowski H. Goldman E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5469-5476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GST-PST binding assay was used to determine relative intracellular PAP concentrations in yeast strains grown under various conditions. The PAP concentration determined in the binding assay was normalized to the total soluble protein in parallel extracts and verified by reporting the signal that was sensitive to exhaustive in vitro degradation by purified recombinant Met22 (typically >95% of the signal in our assay was PAP). The PAP concentration in yeast cells grown in the absence of lithium was below the detectable limits of the assay (∼0.5 nmol of PAP per milligram of soluble protein) (Fig. 3A). However, when the wild-type cells were treated for 8 h with 100 mm LiCl in the absence of methionine, the PAP concentration increased to 42.9 nmol/mg, an increase of at least 85.8-fold (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with the increase found in previous analyses (13Murguia J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29029-29033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Moreover, when methionine (20 μg/ml) was included in the media, the concentration of PAP increased to only 2.3 nmol/mg in the presence of lithium (Fig. 3A). This suppression of lithium-induced PAP accumulation by methionine supplementation is consistent with data that suggest that methionine suppresses PAP synthesis through transcriptional down-regulation of the MET3 promoter (20Martin R.L. Daley L.A. Lovric Z. Wailes L.M. Renosto F. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11768-11775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), decreases PAPS production (19Jakubowski H. Goldman E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5469-5476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and moderates the effects of lithium (13Murguia J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29029-29033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1998; 16: 7184-7195Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To verify that this effect is due to the loss of ATP sulfurylase activity, we next measured lithium-induced PAP accumulation in the presence of chlorate, a widely used cell-permeable inhibitor of mammalian and yeast ATP sulfurylase activity (21Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 22Ullrich T.C. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1117-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Chlorate has been used in mammalian cells to specifically decrease levels of PAPS in order to block downstream sulfurylation of biomolecules (for examples, see Refs. 23Girard J. Baekkevold E. Amalric F. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Chang C. Kane K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4367-4374PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schriever C. Breithardt G. Schmidt A. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In our system, chlorate supplementation reduced PAP levels 65% to ∼15 nmol/mg in the presence of lithium. Given the effects of chlorate and methionine on PAP metabolism, we next analyzed their effects on lithium-mediated growth inhibition (Fig. 3, B and C). Wild-type cells grown in synthetic minimal media lacking methionine supplemented with increasing amounts of lithium were growth inhibited such that 50% growth (IC50) was achieved at ∼40 mm lithium chloride. The addition of methionine resulted in a significant reduction in lithium toxicity, and the IC50 was ∼160 mm (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the addition of 25 mm chlorate resulted in a reduction of lithium-induced growth inhibition with an IC50 value of ∼80 mm (Fig. 3C). The effect of chlorate is especially significant, because methionine does not transcriptionally down-regulate mammalian PAPS synthetase enzymes as it does for Met3 in budding yeast (26Kim H.J. Madhu C. Cho J.H. Klaassen C.D. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 840-845PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these data provide strong evidence that the pharmacological down-regulation of PAP synthesis may be a fruitful strategy for modulating the cellular effects of lithium. Genetic Reduction in PAP Biosynthesis Reduces the Toxic Effects of Lithium—The sulfur assimilation pathway that leads to the production of PAP is an evolutionarily conserved system, so it is reasonable that lithium's effects on PAP accumulation in yeast could be mirrored in certain tissues of other organisms. We showed previously that the expression of mammalian BPNT1 was able to complement the defect due to genetic deletion of the yeast bisphosphate nucleotidase Met22 (2Spiegelberg B.D. Xiong J.-P. Smith J.J. Gu R.F. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13619-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate the similarity between yeast and mammalian nucleotide synthesis machinery, we tested the ability of human PAPS synthesis enzymes to functionally replace those of yeast. In mammals, the ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase activities of Met3 and Met14 are expressed on a single dual-functional enzyme called PAPS synthetase (27Li H. Deyrup A. Mensch J.R. Domowicz M. Konstantidis A.K. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29453-29459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Venkatachalam K.V. Akita H. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19311-19320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Humans express at least two isoforms of PAPS synthetase, hPAPSS1 and hPAPSS2 (29Franzon V.L. Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Cleary E.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which show >80% amino acid sequence similarity. The amino-terminal domain of hPAPSS2 has APS kinase activity and shares similarity with S. cerevisiae Met14 (28Venkatachalam K.V. Akita H. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19311-19320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas the carboxyl terminus of hPAPSS2 has ATP sulfurylase activity and shares similarity with Met3, including its strict conservation of active site residues (22Ullrich T.C. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1117-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Ullrich T.C. Blaesse M. Huber R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 316-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because of its commercial availability, hPAPSS2 was subcloned via PCR from the IMAGE Consortium expressed sequence tag clone AL540583 into a galactose-inducible yeast expression vector and transformed into wild-type yeast or homozygous diploid met3Δ or met14Δ strains. Episomal expression of the deleted gene or heterologous expression of hPAPSS2 rescued growth on media lacking methionine in both met3Δ and met14Δ (Fig. 4), confirming that the human dual functional enzyme is sufficient to replace the two PAPS synthesis activities of yeast. In addition to complementing the methionine auxotrophy of the met3 and met14 mutant yeast, hPAPSS2 expression was also able to rescue the lithium-induced PAP accumulation. The concentrations of PAP in met3Δ and met14Δ cells transformed with an empty vector were found to be below the detectable limits of the assay and remained undetectable regardless of the concentration of methionine and lithium in the culture media (data not shown). This finding indicated that the MET3 and MET14 gene products work along the same linear pathway to form the major route of PAP production. Strains lacking endogenous ATP sulfurylase or APS kinase but heterologously expressing hPAPSS2 were grown and treated as described above. As shown in Fig. 5A, the expression of hPAPSS2 restored PAP accumulation in the presence of lithium to ∼36.2 nmol of PAP per milligram of protein in met3Δ and 32.8 nmol/mg in met14Δ, which were near wild-type levels. Furthermore, the lithium toxicity in the complemented strains was restored to near that of the wild-type strain, having inhibitory values of ∼2.5 mm (Fig. 5, B and C) as compared with >25 mm for met3 or met14 null strains. Taken together, these data suggest that a mammalian PAPS synthetase is functional in a heterologous system and that the substrates or products of the enzyme, rather than non-catalytic protein components, are sufficient for the biological functions of these proteins. Furthermore we demonstrate that synthesis of PAP or PAPS is necessary for the full potency of lithium toxicity and provide genetic proof that PAP down-regulation results in lithium resistance. Lithium's Mechanism of Action in Human Patients and Its Therapeutic Ramifications—Studies of lithium's biological effects in model organisms have the potential to improve the treatment of bipolar disorder. Here we provide new evidence further implicating 3′-nucleotidase activity as a relevant target of lithium, contributing to its cellular toxicity in budding yeast. Our data support a mechanism in which lithium directly inhibits 3′-nucleotidase and exerts its biological effects through the accumulation of PAP (or possibly PAPS), resulting in the perturbation of cellular processes. PAP has been shown through biological and biochemical studies to affect the activity of several cellular pathways, including the yeast Xrn1p (14Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1998; 16: 7184-7195Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar), eukaryotic nucleoside diphosphate kinase (31Schneider B. Xu Y.W. Janin J. Veron M. Deville-Bonne D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28773-28778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), PAPS·PAP antiport systems (32Ozeran J.D. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3685-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and adenylyl cyclase (33Johnson R.A. Yeung S.-M.H. Stubner D. Bushfield M. Shoshani I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 681-688PubMed Google Scholar). Our work demonstrating that genetic and pharmacological manipulation of the PAP metabolism may provide a powerful tool for attenuating lithium's effects could have important applications for improving lithium therapies in bipolar patients. The reformulation of lithium therapies to include a”chlorate-like“down-regulator of PAP synthesis may reduce unwanted toxicity and allow for the widening of its current narrow therapeutic window. Clearly, any pharmacological manipulation of PAP metabolism and sulfur assimilation pathways must proceed with caution. Sulfation of biomolecules is important in the maintenance of cellular integrity, and PAPS-dependent detoxification of certain metabolites and exogenous compounds is essential for the protection of the body from the deleterious effects of normal physiology and environmental exposure. Therefore, if a PAPS synthetase inhibitor is developed as a potential lithium antidote, controlled studies are essential to assess kidney and liver function in the presence of such a compound. In addition to a role for 3′-nucleotidase activity in mediating lithium toxicity, it is also possible that BPNT1 and the PAP metabolism are important for therapeutic effects of lithium. BPNT1 expression, although relatively low with respect to the entire brain (2Spiegelberg B.D. Xiong J.-P. Smith J.J. Gu R.F. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13619-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), may be enriched in portions of the brain particularly important to mood disorders and, thus, is especially pertinent to lithium therapy. Alternatively, neuronal tissue expressing low levels of BPNT1 may be more sensitive to the effects of lithium, similar to what we observed in humanized yeast grown under conditions of low versus high BPNT1 expression. If inhibition of BPNT1 does play a therapeutic role in bipolar patients, then development of specific inhibitors of BPNT1 will be helpful for improving therapies. In this regard, the humanized BPNT1 yeast strain reported here represents an important tool useful for novel cell-based high throughput screens aimed at the identification of inhibitors of human BPNT1. We thank Blaine Armbruster for helpful discussions and ideas and Dr. Josh Frederick for critical review of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2006041848,"The effect of a typical neuroleptic haloperidol (Hal) on mPer1 gene expression was investigated in mouse suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Hal induced mPer1 mRNA levels both in vivo and in cultured SCN cells. For mechanisms underlying Hal-induced mPer1 expression, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor subtype, the phosphorylation form of the transcription factor, and the Ser-133 phosphorylation form of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) played an important role, because the induction of mPer1 mRNA significantly decreased after pretreatment with a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, such as MK-801 or CREB antisense. These results suggest that Hal may increase CREB phosphorylation and mPer1 expression according to the activation of the NMDA receptor through the dopaminergic pathways. Although the injection of Hal during the light period increased the amplitude of mPer1 mRNA rhythmicity in a nondrug state, the injection of the drug during the dark period disturbed the rhythmic pattern of mPer1 mRNA. These results suggest that the rhythmicity of clock genes in SCN may be disturbed depending on the dosing time of Hal. On the other hand, because the induction of mPer1 mRNA by Hal seems to be at least partly caused by the NMDA receptor, showing a phase shift or resetting effect of the circadian clock, Hal may also cause such phase shift effects.

The variation of behavior and biological functions in whole animals expressed as circadian rhythms is controlled by the endogenous clock (pacemaker), which resides in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) 1The abbreviations used are: SCN, suprachiasmatic nuclei; Hal, haloperidol; D1, dopamine 1; D2, dopamine 2; PKA, protein kinase A; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; P-CREB, Ser-133 phosphorylation form of CREB; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; AC, adenylate cyclase; CaM, calmodulin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; 8-OH DPAT, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin.

The pacemaker components such as Clock, Bmal1, Periods (Per1, Per2, and Per3), and Cryptochromes (Cry1 and Cry2) express their circadian rhythms, which are persistently rhythmic, even under constant environmental conditions and external stimuli that could change the timing of the rhythm. Most of these components are probably controlled rhythmically by integrating the external cues from the entrainment pathway and initiating a variety of signals to the output pathway, which determines the circadian activities of the organism (4Hao H. Allen D.L. Hardin P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3687-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 5Dunlap J.C.

A typical neuroleptic haloperidol (Hal) is a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist for the treatment of schizophrenia. The blocking of dopamine 2 (D2) receptors by Hal has been associated with therapeutic action and also with extrapyramidal effects such as catalepsy in rodent. Cataleptic responses to this drug vary throughout the day, with a maximum at mid-light and a minimum at mid-dark (6Campbell A. Baldessarini R.J. Psychopharmacology. 1982; 77: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Nagayama H. Takagi A. Takahashi R. Experientia (Basel). 1987; 43: 625-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is believed that the extrapyramidal effects are because of the blockage of D2 receptors and could result from the induction of the clock-controlled gene c-fos through the activation of adenylate cyclase and the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway in the striatum (8Sirinathsinghji D.J.

Per1 is particularly interesting because of its very high amplitude of circadian expression (the peak:trough ratio is more than 5 at the mRNA level). In addition, several studies suggest that Per1 is intimately associated with organism activities because there is a similarity in response to light between Per1 mRNA induction and rodent behavior (13Albrecht U. Sun Z.S. Eichele G. Lee C.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 14Shigeyoshi Y. Taguchi K. Yamamoto S. Takekida S. Yan L. Tei H. Moriya T. Shibata S. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Okamura H. Cell. 1997; 91: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the mutation according to the loss of functional Per1-encoded protein abolishes the free running rhythm (15Power J.M. Ringo J.M. Dowse H.B. J. Biol. Rhythms. 1995; 10: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In mice, the mutation of mPer1 leads to a shorter circadian period of locomotor activity, with reduced precision and stability (16Zheng B. Albrecht U. Kaasik K. Sage M. Lu W. Vaishnav S. Li Q. Sun Z.S. Eichele G. Bradley A. Lee C.C. Cell. 2001; 105: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). In addition to the induction of Per1 expression by light, the induction of Per1 is also seen in cultured rat fibroblasts after exposure to high concentrations of serum or to the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin (17Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 18Yagita K. Okamura H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that repetitive administration of the antitumor agent interferon-α induces a dosing schedule-dependent alteration of mPer mRNA expression in the mouse SCN (19Ohdo S. Koyanagi S. Suyama H. Higuchi S. Aramaki H. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the expression of Per1 could be altered by various stimuli through various pathways, and this alteration may cause changes in physiological activities of downstream organisms. In another way, the alteration in the expression level of Per1 may relate to the level of susceptibility to the drug. In the present study, therefore, we investigated the effect of Hal on the expression of mPer1 mRNA in mouse SCN. We also clarified the mechanism underlying Hal-induced mPer1 gene expression by using the non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801 and the cultured SCN cell transfected with antisense deoxyoligonucleotide directed against cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) mRNA. Animals and Treatments—Six-week-old male ICR mice purchased from Charles River Japan (Kanagawa, Japan) were used. Prior to experiments, the animals were housed 3–6/cage with free access to food and water, under controlled lighting. The light:dark ratio was 12:12 h (7:00 a.m., lights on; 7:00 p.m., lights off), constant temperature was 24 ± 1 °C, and controlled humidity was 60 ± 10%. All mice were kept under these conditions for 1 week before use. Hal (5 mg/ml ampule, Serenace, Dai Nippon Seiyaku Co., Ltd.) or (+) MK-801 maleate (Tocris) diluted or dissolved, respectively, in 0.9% saline was administered by intraperitoneal injection at the dose and time indicated below. The volumes of injection were standardized to 1 ml/10 g of body weight. In the dark period, mice were injected, and their brains were removed under dim red illumination. To study the effect of dosage on mPer1 mRNA levels in SCN regions, groups of 18 mice were each administered saline or 1, 4, or 8 mg/kg Hal before lights on (6:00 a.m.). Thereafter, animals were decapitated at 10:00 a.m., and their brains were removed quickly and placed in Hanks' balanced salt solution. The coronal sections were cut through the hypothalamus at the level of optic chiasma to obtain sections including the SCN, and the SCN regions were taken out to investigate mPer1 mRNA levels by RT-PCR. To monitor the time course of mPer1 mRNA levels in SCN regions following Hal administration, groups of nine mice were each administered saline or 4 mg/kg Hal before lights on (6:00 a.m.). This dosage was employed to provide highly significant changes in mPer1 mRNA levels and to avoid inducing high suppression to mouse, which resulted in the effect of dosage on mPer1 mRNA levels. In addition, this dosage is similar to the dosage used in our previous study (20Viyoch J. Ohdo S. Yukawa E. Higuchi S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 964-969PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were then decapitated 2, 4, 6, or 16 h after injection, and their SCN regions were dissected out to analyze mPer1 mRNA levels. To study the influence of administration time on the induction of mPer1 mRNA levels in SCN regions, groups of nine mice were each administered saline or 4 mg/kg Hal at one of the following times: 9:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., 5:00 p.m., 9:00 p.m., 1:00 a.m., or 5:00 a.m. Mice were decapitated 4 h after injection, and their SCN regions were collected for investigation of mPer1 mRNA levels. The sampling time was determined to correspond with maximum mPer1 mRNA levels of response to Hal, which resulted from monitoring of mPer1 mRNA levels following the administration of 4 mg/kg Hal. To investigate the possible involvement of NMDA receptors in Hal-induced mPer1 mRNA levels in SCN regions, groups of nine mice each were administered saline, Hal, MK-801 plus Hal, or MK-801 at 9:00 a.m. The dose of Hal or MK-801 was 4 or 0.1 mg/kg, respectively. For the MK-801 plus Hal-treated group, mice were administered MK-801 prior to Hal for 20 min. All groups of mice were decapitated 2 h after the final injection, and their SCN regions were collected to investigate mPer1 mRNA levels. The dose of MK-801 and sampling time were determined using an earlier study (21Chartoff E.H. Ward R.P. Dorsa D.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 531-537PubMed Google Scholar). To study the effect of Hal on the Ser-133 phosphorylation form of CREB in SCN regions, we first investigated the 24-h rhythm in levels of P-CREB in mouse SCN presented. Groups of three mice were decapitated at 9:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., 5:00 p.m., 9:00 p.m., 1:00 a.m., or 5:00 a.m. After the brains were removed, the SCN regions were immediately dissected out and analyzed for P-CREB levels by Western blot analysis. Thereafter, the other groups of mice were each administered saline or 4 mg/kg Hal at 1:00 p.m. and then decapitated 2, 4, or 8 h after injection to monitor P-CREB levels. The injection time was determined using nearby corresponding minimal P-CREB levels that were found from 24-h rhythms of P-CREB study. To study the involvement of CREB in mediating mPer1 mRNA levels by Hal, primary cultures of SCN cells and liposome-antisense deoxyoligonucleotide directed against CREB mRNA (DNA) complex were employed. The cultures were treated with empty liposome (control), liposome-DNA complex, empty liposome plus Hal, or liposome-DNA complex plus Hal. Total RNA was collected for analysis by RT-PCR. To investigate the efficiency of liposome-DNA complex activity, the levels of CREB following CREB antisense transfection were also observed by Western blots. Primary Cultures of Mouse SCN and Treatment of Cultures—Cell isolation and culture procedures were modified from an earlier report (22Honma S. Katsuno Y. Tanahashi Y. Abe H. Honma K. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 967-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, SCN regions were isolated from 5–7-day-old ICR mouse brains at 9:00 a.m. and incubated in an isotonic salt solution of 0.6 mg/ml trypsin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells then were rinsed with an isotonic salt solution mixture of 0.2 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and resuspended in the same solution. Cell suspension was centrifuged at 650 rpm for 10 min. The obtained cell pellet was resuspended (about 40 μl/SCN) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nikken Bio Medical Laboratory) containing 15 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, and 20 mg/liter kanamycin (Invitrogen). ∼1 × 106 viable cells (100 μl of cell suspension) were plated into 24-well plates (Greiner Labortrchnik, Frickenhausen, Germany) coated with 0.02% poly-l-ornithine. After incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 4 h, 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 100 μg/ml human transferrin (Sigma), 100 μm putrescine (Sigma), 20 nm progesterone (Sigma), 30 nm sodium selenite (Sigma), and 20 mg/liter kanamycin was overlaid, and cultures were incubated under the conditions mentioned above for further study. For treatment of cells with CREB antisense, the procedure was performed after incubation for 24 h. The transfection method was modified from an earlier report (23Sato-Bigbee C. DeVries G.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 98-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CREB gene corresponding to nucleotides 27–46 (5′-TGG TCA TCT AGT CAC CGG TG-3′) was incubated with an equivalent amount of cationic liposome (Lipofectin reagent, Invitrogen) (1 μg of DNA:5 μl of liposome) for 15 min at room temperature. Cultures were washed with modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (OPTI-MEM I, Invitrogen) once prior to adding 500 μl of the same medium containing liposome-DNA complex. After a 5-h incubation, the medium was replaced by normal supplemented medium. For treatment of cells with Hal, 50 μm drug was directly added in a medium of empty liposome or liposome-DNA complex-transfected cells after transfection for 72 h. Total RNA was extracted after adding Hal for 2 h. CREB levels of control and CREB antisense-treated cultures were analyzed by Western blots after transfection for 72 h. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Amplification—Total RNA from the mouse SCN tissues or cultures was extracted using TRIzol solution (Invitrogen). Finally, the RNA was resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and kept at –80 °C. A one-step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) was used for reverse transcription of 200 ng of RNA, and mPer1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA were amplified by PCR in a single tube. PCR primers were designed as follows: mPer1-5′, 5′-CCC AGG CCC GGA GAA CCT TTT T-3′; mPer1-3′, 5′-CGA AGT TTG AGC TCC CGA AGT G-3′; GAPDH-5′, 5′-GAC CTC AAC TAC ATG GTC TAC A-3′; GAPDH-3′, 5′-ACT CCA CGA CAT ACT CAG CAC-3′. PCR was conducted in a programmed temperature control system (PC 700, Astec, Fukuoka, Japan) for 25 cycles under the following cycle conditions: 1 min at 94 °C for denaturation, 1 min at 50 °C for annealing, 2 min at 72 °C for extension, and 2 min at 15 °C for holding. The sizes of the PCR products of mPer1 and GAPDH were 403 and 178 base pairs, respectively. PCR products were run on 3% agarose gels. The band intensity of mPer1 mRNA was analyzed using NIH Image software on a Macintosh computer, and amounts were measured versus GAPDH. Western Blot Analysis—The procedure of Western blot analysis for CREB and P-CREB from the mouse SCN tissues and cultures was modified from earlier works (24McNulty S. Schurov I.L. Sloper P.J. Hastings M.H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Obrietan K. Impey S. Smith D. Athos J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17748-17756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). SCN tissues were resuspended in lysis buffer, pH 7.4, composed of 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicated for 10 s. 2× sample buffer in the same volume of sample suspension was then added (20 μg of total protein for each sample). For primary cultures, cells (1 × 107 cells/well) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed by adding 100 μlof2× sample buffer, and then sonicated for 10 s. The sample was heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Afterward, the sample was vortexed for 20 s and then centrifuged to remove debris at 13,000 × g for 8 min. The sample was loaded on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were separated at 20 mA for 2 h. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 2 h. Transblotted membrane was incubated at room temperature for 2 h in blocking solution composed of Tris-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary rabbit antibody (1:1000 for CREB, 1:500 for P-CREB, New England Biolabs Inc., Hertfordshire, UK) in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20. Thereafter, transblotted membrane was washed three times in washing buffer composed of Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 prior to incubation at room temperature for 1 h with anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000, New England Biolabs Inc.) in blocking solution. Membrane was washed three times in washing buffer and then developed using a chemiluminescence detection kit (New England Biolabs Inc.) prior to exposure to x-ray film (Hyperfilm™ MP, Amersham Biosciences). Band intensity was analyzed using NIH Image software on a Macintosh computer. Total proteins were verified using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Statistics—Data were analyzed using Student's t test for two independent groups, and analysis of variance was used for multiple comparisons. The 5% level of probability was considered to be significant. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Effect of Dosage on Levels of mPer1 mRNA in Mouse SCN Regions—Fig. 1 shows data for the levels of mPer1 mRNA followed by acute Hal administration at various doses. These results imply that mRNA levels of mPer1, which is the component of oscillators, obviously elevate following Hal treatment. Furthermore, the relative mPer1 mRNA levels showed marked differences in response to varied doses of Hal. Statistical differences (p < 0.01) were seen between saline- and Hal-treated groups. These differences increased 40, 70, and 110% for groups treated with 1, 4, or 8 mg/kg Hal, respectively, compared with the saline-treated group. Time Course of Hal-induced mPer1 mRNA in Mouse SCN Regions—As shown in Fig. 2, mPer1 was strongly and temporarily responsive to 4 mg/kg Hal. The transient increase in the levels of mPer1 mRNA, as compared with controls, reached the maximum at 4 h (increasing by 50–60% as compared with the saline group, p < 0.01) before returning to background levels 6 h after administration. Effect of Administration Time on Hal-induced mPer1 mRNA in Mouse SCN Regions—As shown in Fig. 3, treatment with Hal drove the marked elevation of the levels of mPer1 mRNA at every time point in this study (p < 0.01 at 9:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., 9:00 p.m., 1:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m.; p < 0.05 at 5:00 p.m. as compared with its control). However, the percent of induction of mPer1 mRNA was minimal at 1:00 a.m., the sampling time (increasing by 20% as compared with saline group). Effect of NMDA Receptor Antagonist on Hal-induced mPer1 mRNA in Mouse SCN Regions—We have shown previously that mPer1 could be induced by neuroleptic Hal. As shown in Fig. 4, a similar pattern of the significant enhancement of mPer1 mRNA following Hal administration compared with the saline-treated group was also obtained in this experiment (p < 0.01). In the MK-801 plus Hal-treated group, pretreatment with MK-801 significantly reduced the enhancement of mPer1 mRNA by Hal (∼30%) compared with the Hal-treated group (p < 0.05). The dose used on the MK-801-treated group had no significant effect on mPer1 mRNA levels compared with the saline-treated group. 24-Hour Rhythms in P-CREB and the Effect of Hal on P-CREB Levels in Mouse SCN Regions—As shown in Fig. 5, levels of P-CREB exhibited a significant 24-h rhythm under the 12 h light:12 h dark cycle (p < 0.01). Maximum levels were observed from 5:00 to 9:00 a.m. Levels of P-CREB declined during mid-light and then began to rise before dusk. However, CREB levels did not vary over the time span. The results of the effect of Hal on P-CREB levels is shown in Fig. 6. Remarkably, Hal treatment triggered the temporal induction of P-CREB 2 h after administration by 50% compared with the group of mice treated by saline and sampled at the same time (p < 0.05). Thereafter, P-CREB levels declined until they reached basal levels ∼4 h after injection. In the saline-treated group, P-CREB levels 8 h after injection (9:00 p.m.) were significantly higher than at all other sampling time points (p < 0.05). Effect of CREB Antisense on Hal-induced mPer1 mRNA in Mouse SCN Cultures—In our experiment, the transfection conditions showed that treatment with antisense deoxyoligonucleotide significantly reduced CREB levels in SCN cultures (Fig. 7A). The effect of treatment with CREB antisense on mPer1 mRNA in SCN cultures is shown in Fig. 7, B and C. A significant difference in mPer1 mRNA levels was obtained between control and cultures treated with antisense CREB (p < 0.01). Treatment of control cultures with 50 μm Hal resulted in significant increases in mPer1 mRNA levels (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the stimulation by Hal was significantly reduced when the cultures were pretreated with CREB antisense (p < 0.01). In addition, a significant difference between control and the CREB antisense plus Hal-treated group was seen (p < 0.05). The explanation of complex behaviors at the level of gene expression is one of the ultimate goals of neuroscience. A number of studies have shown that mPer1 in SCN may be central in determining organism activities because there is a similarity in behavior in the response to light in mPer1 mRNA induction. Another question is whether the effects of other external cues, such as drug, interfere with the action of dopamine and affect motor activity in mPer1 expression. To answer this question, mPer1 mRNA levels of SCN were monitored in mice given neuroleptic Hal. Interestingly, mPer1 mRNA levels could be strongly and transiently induced by acute administration of Hal in a dose-dependent manner. We attempted to clarify the possible biochemical pathways that mediate transcriptional induction of mPer1 following acute Hal administration (Fig. 8). We found that Hal could greatly activate (by 50%) the phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB within 2 h after treatment. The obtained results of our present study revealed the maximum influence of Hal on mPer1 4 h after treatment. In addition, the study of the effect of CREB antisense on Hal-induced mPer1 mRNA in the cultured SCN cell showed that the induction levels of mPer1 mRNA by Hal significantly decreased after pretreatment with CREB antisense. A significant decrease in mPer1 mRNA levels in non-Hal-treated cultures transfected by CREB antisense, as compared with control, was also seen. Four conserved cAMP-responsive elements (TGACGTCA) are present in the 5′ flanking regulatory regions of the mPer1 genes (26Travnickova B.Z. Cermakian N. Reppert S.M. Sassone C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7728-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 27Hida A. Koike N. Hirose M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Tei H. Genomics. 2000; 65: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated CREB activates cAMP-responsive element-mediated Per1 transcription (25Obrietan K. Impey S. Smith D. Athos J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17748-17756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 26Travnickova B.Z. Cermakian N. Reppert S.M. Sassone C.P. Proc. Natl.

In addition, it has been reported that the adenylate cyclase (AC) activator, forskolin, increases rPer1 mRNA in rat-1 fibroblast. These results suggest that Hal enhances the phosphorylation of CREB and finally elicits the levels of mPer1 mRNA through P-CREB binding with the cis-element (CaRE/cAMP-responsive element; calcium/cAMP-responsive element). Another question is how Hal activates and phosphorylates CREB. Hal mediates the pharmacological action mainly via antagonizing D2 receptors. However, Hal also affects D1 receptors, α1 noradrenaline receptors, and serotonin receptors (28Hyttel J. Larsen J.J. Christensen A.V. Psychopharmacol. 1995; 87: 9-18Google Scholar, 29Ohta M. Physiol.

Brain Res. 1994; 23: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) in mouse SCN. D2 receptors inhibit AC by coupling with the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gi protein) (33Weiner D.M. Levey A.I. Sunahara R.K. Niznik H.B. O'Dowd B.F. Seeman P. Brann M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The so-called Gi protein couples to inhibitory receptors, finally resulting in inhibition of cAMP formation. Inhibition of D2 receptors with Hal increases cAMP levels, activates the PKA second messenger pathways, and increases CREB phosphorylation (38Leveque J.C. Macias W. Rajadhyaksha A. Carlson R.R. Barczak A. Kang S. Li X.M. Coyle J.T. Huganir R.L. Heckers S. Konradi C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4011-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the second messenger pathway also increases NMDA receptors function via the 897Ser-NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors phosphorylation, such that the NMDA receptors activate Ca2+ influx (38Leveque J.C. Macias W. Rajadhyaksha A. Carlson R.R. Barczak A. Kang S. Li X.M. Coyle J.T. Huganir R.L. Heckers S. Konradi C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4011-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx activates Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinases and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK-MAPK) pathway (39Rajadhyaksha A. Barczak A. Macias W. Leveque J.C. Lewis S.E. Konradi C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6348-6359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases and ERK-MAPK signaling cascade induce CREB phosphorylation. CREB phosphorylation increases c-fos mRNA (38Leveque J.C. Macias W. Rajadhyaksha A. Carlson R.R. Barczak A. Kang S. Li X.M. Coyle J.T. Huganir R.L. Heckers S. Konradi C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4011-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the induction of mPer1 mRNA by Hal significantly decreased by 30% after pretreatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801, and MK-801 reduced mPer1 mRNA but not significantly when compared with the saline-treated group. These results suggest that Hal may increase CREB phosphorylation and mPer1 mRNA according to the activation of NMDA receptor through the dopaminergic pathways. As the other possible pathway, D1 receptors stimulate AC by coupling with stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gs protein) (33Weiner D.M. Levey A.I. Sunahara R.K. Niznik H.B. O'Dowd B.F. Seeman P. Brann M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The so-called Gs protein couples to stimulatory receptors, ultimately leading to the stimulation of cAMP formation. Both dopamine and the D1 agonist increase CREB phosphorylation, and D1 antagonist blocks the effect in SCN (40Schurov I.L. Hepworth T.J. Hastings M.H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 41Viswanathan N. Weaver D.R. Reppert S.M. Davis F.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5393-5398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of D1 receptors with Hal may decrease cAMP levels, inactivate the PKA second messenger pathway, and decrease CREB phosphorylation. α1 noradrenaline receptors stimulate phospholipase C through guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) isotype with subsequent activation of protein kinase C (42Garcia-Sainz J.A. Villalobos M.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 500: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Phospholipase C catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate into the second messengers, inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol trisphosphate plays a role in the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C. Ca2+ influx activates CREB phosphorylation by the ERK-MAPK signaling cascade (43Zhong H. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 261-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 44Grewal S.S.

Inhibition of α1 receptors with Hal may decrease phospholipase C activation levels, inactivate the protein kinase C second messenger pathway, and decrease CREB phosphorylation. 5HT1a and 5HT1b receptors inhibit AC with a rapid decrease of cAMP levels via Gi protein (45Lesch K.P. J. Affect. Disord. 2001; 62: 57-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Inhibition of 5HT1a receptors with Hal may increase cAMP levels, activate the PKA second messenger pathway, and increase CREB phosphorylation. 5HT5a and 5HT7 receptors stimulate AC mainly through a stimulatory Gs protein (45Lesch K.P. J. Affect. Disord. 2001; 62: 57-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH DPAT), a selective agonist at 5HT1a and 5HT5a/7, exhibited a higher affinity for 5HT5/7 receptors than 5HT1a receptors (46Sprouse J. Reynolds L. Li X. Braselton J. Schmidt A. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 47Sprouse J. Reynolds L. Braselton J. Schmidt A. Synapse. 2004; 54: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 8-OH DPAT increased cAMP production. Inhibition of 5HT5a and 5HT7 receptors with Hal may decrease cAMP levels, inactivate the PKA second messenger pathway, and decrease CREB phosphorylation. These results suggest that Hal may induce CREB phosphorylation via 5HT1a and 5HT1b serotonin receptors in addition to D2 receptors and NMDA receptors mediated by D2 receptors. We also found that Hal induced the levels of mPer1 mRNA at every time point. In addition, the amount of induction is minimal at the time corresponding to minimum catalepsy responses to a single Hal administration (at 1:00 a.m.) according to our previous study (20Viyoch J. Ohdo S. Yukawa E. Higuchi S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 964-969PubMed Google Scholar). These findings likely indicate that the alteration of mPer1 levels in SCN correlates to the alteration of drug response. However, the induction of mPer1 mRNA rose to the maximum level at 4 h and then was restored to the normal level 6 h after injection, whereas the catalepsy responses rose to the maximum level 1–2 h after injection and then were maintained over the basal level for 4–5 h. Therefore, the induction of mPer1 mRNA in SCN may not be directly responsible for the cataleptic responses after Hal treatment, and/or SCN is not a major action target for the catalepsy induced by Hal. The results obtained also raise the questions of whether Hal could alter the levels of mPer1 mRNA in other brain regions such as the striatum, which is directly involved in regulation of motor output, and whether the alteration that occurred relates to the alteration in cataleptic response after administration at different times of day. Hal decreases the locomotor activity and disturbs the rhythmic pattern on the third and fourth day of a Hal diet (48Kumar A. Chandra O. Saxena P.N. Arzneim-Forsch. 1981; 31: 1096-1098PubMed Google Scholar). To the contrary, the withdrawal of Hal increases the locomotor activity and disturbes the rhythmic pattern. In the present study, although the injection of Hal during the light period increased the amplitude of mPer1 mRNA rhythmicity in a nondrug state, the injection of the drug during the dark period disturbed the rhythmic pattern of mPer1 mRNA. These results suggest that the rhythmicity of clock genes in SCN may be disturbed depending on the dosing time of Hal. On the other hand, because the induction of mPer1 mRNA by Hal was significantly inhibited by the NMDA receptor blocker in the present study, the effect of Hal seems to be at least partly due to the NMDA receptor. NMDA receptors are principally involved in photic resetting of the biological clock in rodents. NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 suppresses the photic resetting of behavioral rhythms (49Colwell C.S. Foster R.G. Menaker M. Brain Res. 1991; 554: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and also reduces the c-fos, Per1, and Per2 mRNA induction by light in the SCN (50Guido M.E. de Guido L. Goguen D. Robertson H.A. Rusak B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 51Moriya T. Horikawa K. Akiyama M. Shibata S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1554-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, NMDA application to the SCN elicits a phase shift in wheel-running rhythm (52Mintz E.M. Marvel C.L. Gillespie C.F. Price K.M. Albers H.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5124-5130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hal also affects the serotonin receptors (28Hyttel J. Larsen J.J. Christensen A.V. Psychopharmacol. 1995; 87: 9-18Google Scholar, 30Stool J.C. Tilders F.J. Fluckiger E. Muller E.E. Thoner M.O. Dopamine Receptors in the Central Nervous System: The Role of Brain Dopamine.

New Neuroleptics and Experimental Antipsychotics in Schizophrenia: Psychopharmacology, the Third Generation of Progress. Raven Press, New York1987: 1129-1140Google Scholar). A daytime injection of 8-OH DPAT, a serotonin 1a/5a/7 receptor agonist, induces a phase advance in behavioral rhythms in vivo (53Mintz E.M. Gillespie C.F. Marvel C.L. Huhman K.L. Albers H.E. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 563-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) as well as the neuron activity rhythm of the SCN in vitro (46Sprouse J. Reynolds L. Li X. Braselton J. Schmidt A. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 47Sprouse J. Reynolds L. Braselton J. Schmidt A. Synapse. 2004; 54: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The acute and circadian time-dependent reduction of Per1 and/or Per2 mRNA in the hamster SCN by 8-OH DPAT is strongly correlated with the phase resetting in response to the drug (54Akiyama M. Kouzu Y. Takahashi S. Wakamatsu H. Moriya T. Maetani M. Watanabe S. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Shibata S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1115-1121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that Hal may show a phase shift or resetting effect of the circadian clock. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Hal is able to induce the levels of mPer1 mRNA in mouse SCN, both in vivo and in cultured cells. Moreover, our study could clarify the mechanism underlying Hal-induced mPer1. Here we reveal that the NMDA receptor and P-CREB play an important role in the Hal-induced mPer1 phenomenon."

An undesirable result of this conformational flexibility is that most inhibitory serpins are heat sensitive, forming inactive polymers at elevated temperatures.

Flexibility in the shutter region and electrostatic interactions at the top of the A β-sheet (the breach) involving the C-terminal tail, a unique structural feature of thermopin, are postulated to be important for controlling inhibitory activity and triggering conformational change, respectively, in the native state.

A recent authoritative classification of known peptidase inhibitors reveals that serpins are the only inhibitor family present in all three superkingdoms of life (Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea) as well as certain viruses (1Rawlings N.D. Tolle D.P. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The majority of serpins are found in multicellular eukaryotes and inhibit serine or (more rarely) cysteine proteases. Inhibitory serpins are unusual molecules that fold into a native metastable state and utilize a complex conformational change to achieve protease inhibition (4Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W.

Following cleavage, and throughout the S to R transition, the protease remains covalently attached to the serpin via an acyl bond between the side chain of the active site serine (or cysteine) and the carbonyl oxygen of the P1 residue in the RCL. The x-ray crystal structure of antitrypsin in complex with trypsin revealed that the enzyme is translocated 75 Å to the base of the inhibitor where it is trapped in a distorted, inactive conformation (11Kaslik G.

The events following successful protease inhibition are irreversible, and serpins are thus termed suicide inhibitors. The size and conformational flexibility of serpins allow for an exquisite degree of functional control, and many serpins require specific co-factors to effectively inhibit target enzymes. For example, the thrombin/factor Xa inhibitor antithrombin circulates in a relatively inactive conformation until interaction with the co-factor heparin induces a conformational switch to an activated state (15Li W. Johnson D.J. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 16Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc.

An undesirable consequence of this conformational flexibility is that serpins are susceptible to inappropriate conformational change, whereby the RCL of one molecule inserts into the A β-sheet of another, forming inactive long chain loop-sheet polymers (18Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 19Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Biophysical studies on antitrypsin reveal that this molecule passes through a polymerogenic intermediate during folding or unfolding (20James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 2: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The resulting serpin polymers can accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells primarily responsible for protein synthesis, eventually resulting in cell death and organ damage. Numerous mutations in human serpins have been identified that promote polymerization, misfolding, and disease (the “serpinopathies”) (22Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For example, polymerization of antitrypsin and neuroserpin results in liver cirrhosis and dementia, respectively (22Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 23Chow M.K. Lomas D.A. Bottomley S.P. Curr. Med.

Polymerization of native inhibitory serpins can also be induced by mild heating (19Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 25Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1998; 356: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The available genomic data reveal that serpins are sparsely distributed in prokaryotes (27Irving J.A. Steenbakkers P.J. Lesk A.M. Op den Camp H.J. Pike R.N. Whisstock J.C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, predicted serpin genes have recently been discovered in the genomes of three extremophiles, the hyperextremophile archaea Pyrobaculum aerophilum (growth temperature 100 °C), the anaerobic bacteria Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (optimum growth temperature 75 °C), and the moderate thermophilic bacteria Thermobifida fusca (optimum growth temperature 55 °C). Biochemical, structural, and bioinformatic studies suggest that these molecules function as bona fide protease inhibitors and retain the ability to undergo conformational change (27Irving J.A. Steenbakkers P.J. Lesk A.M. Op den Camp H.J. Pike R.N. Whisstock J.C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Irving J.A. Cabrita L.D. Rossjohn J. Pike R.N. Bottomley S.P. Whisstock J.C. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In a previous study it was shown that the serpin thermopin from T. fusca was able to inhibit bovine chymotrypsin and, in comparison to human antitrypsin, possessed enhanced stability at elevated temperatures (28Irving J.A. Cabrita L.D. Rossjohn J. Pike R.N. Bottomley S.P. Whisstock J.C. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The 1.5 Å x-ray crystal structure of the cleaved form of thermopin was determined and revealed that the molecule adopted the typical serpin fold, albeit with several significant variations. In particular, thermopin lacks the G-helix and possesses a C-terminal region (or “tail”) that interacts with a cluster of conserved residues at the top of the A β-sheet. Based upon biophysical and mutagenesis data, it was suggested that C-terminal tail is required for efficient folding at elevated temperatures (28Irving J.A. Cabrita L.D. Rossjohn J. Pike R.N. Bottomley S.P. Whisstock J.C. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Structural analysis revealed that the thermostability of cleaved thermopin is achieved by improved hydrogen bonding and salt bridging, consistent with the results of studies on a range of thermostable proteins (29Liu B.

The native, metastable state of a serpin from a thermophilic organism is intriguing because it represents an evolutionary trade-off between stability and function: how does thermopin maintain a metastable conformation at elevated temperatures while retaining the ability to inactivate target proteases? To answer this question we have determined the 1.8 Å resolution x-ray crystal structure of thermopin in the native conformation. We contrasted and compared the high resolution structures of native and cleaved thermopin and discussed possible structural mechanisms underpinning this paradox. Furthermore, the structures have allowed the most detailed investigation to date of the mechanism of conformational change in serpins. In this regard, the availability of high resolution data is of great importance, previous comparisons between serpin conformers having been limited by the relatively low resolution of one of the structures (8Stein P. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9Whisstock J.C. Skinner R. Carrell R.W. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 685-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Whisstock J.C. Pike R.N. Jin L. Skinner R. Pei X.Y. Carrell R.W. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1287-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Finally, the role of the C-terminal tail in modulating the stability and function of native thermopin was discussed. Cloning—A clone containing the full open reading frame of the T. fusca serpin gene was obtained from the Joint Genome Institute, United States Department of Energy. The gene was initially cloned between the BamHI and SacI sites of the pQE30 (Qiagen) multicloning site as described previously (28Irving J.A. Cabrita L.D. Rossjohn J. Pike R.N. Bottomley S.P. Whisstock J.C. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A pQE30 variant (pQE30ΔHIS) was created that lacked the nucleotide sequence encoding the RGS epitope and hexahistidine tag (nucleotides 118-144). This was achieved following insertion of an oligonucleotide linker between the unique EcoRI and BamHI restriction endonuclease sites of the vector sequence. The oligonucleotide linker was constructed by annealing two 5′-phosphorylated primers, 5′-aattcattaaagaggagaaattaactatgg and 5′-gatcccatagttaatttctcctctttaatg. A BamHI/SacI fragment containing the serpin gene was then excised from the initial pQE30-T.fusca construct and ligated with BamHI/SacI-digested pQE30ΔHIS to create the pQE30ΔHIS-T.fusca construct used in this study. Mutagenesis—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) utilizing a PCR-based strategy was used to introduce the C41S mutation in thermopin. The following oligonucleotide and its antisense counterpart was used (mutation is underlined): 5′-tactccgtggcctccgccctcggcgtc-3′. Positive clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing and transformed into SG13009(pREP4) Escherichia coli cells (Qiagen) for expression. Expression and Purification—Six liters of 2YT broth (100 μg ml-1 ampicillin, 30 μg ml-1 kanamycin) was inoculated with an overnight culture of SG13009 cells harboring pQE30ΔHIS-T.fusca. Expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) at A600 of ∼0.7. Cells were harvested after 5 h and the pellet resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA before flash freezing (N2) (l). Lysozyme (0.5 mg ml-1) was added to the thawed pellet and allowed to incubate for 1 h at 4 °C. The sample was sonicated and heated to 55 °C for 20 min. Centrifugation at 18,000 rpm removed all insoluble material. The supernatant was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated (50 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8) 5-ml HiTrap™ SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), washed to baseline, and eluted using a 60-ml linear gradient into 50 mm Hepes, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8. Peak fractions (SDS-PAGE) were combined, and 4 m NaCl was added until the final salt concentration was ∼2 m. The high salt protein solution was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated (50 mm Hepes, 2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8) 5-ml HiTrap™ phenyl-Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences), washed to baseline, and eluted using a 60-ml linear gradient into 50 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8. Fractions corresponding to pure native-state thermopin were combined, buffer-exchanged into 50 mm Hepes, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, and concentrated (Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter unit; Amicon) to a final concentration of ∼12 mg ml-1 (determined spectrophotometrically using the following relationship: A280 0.81 = 1 mg/ml). Small aliquots were flash frozen and stored at -80 °C for future use. Spectroscopic Methods—Circular dichroism experiments were performed on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo) at 20 °C. θ222 measurements were made with the signal averaged over 15 s. The protein concentration used was 0.2 mg/ml with a 0.1-cm path length. Thermal denaturation was performed at a heating rate of 1 °C/min, at a protein concentration of 0.05 mg/ml. Chemical Denaturation—Stock solutions of guanidine-HCl (GdnHCl) in 20 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0, were prepared and filtered through 0.22-μm membranes before use. The GdnHCl concentration was determined by refractive index measurements as described previously (35Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). Equilibrium unfolding curves were obtained by incubating the protein at various GdnHCl concentrations for 2 h at 20 °C and plotting the signal change at 222 nm (far UV range) as a function of denaturant concentration. No differences were observed in experiments where spectroscopic measurements were taken after equilibration for greater lengths of time or within a concentration range between 0.01 and 0.2 mg/ml. Crystallization—Crystals of native thermopin were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method (36McPherson A. The Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals. John Wiley & Sons, New York1982Google Scholar). Optimization of crystallization conditions led to a reservoir buffer containing 30% polyethylene glycol 4K, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.6. Crystals were grown by mixing equal volumes of 12 mg ml-1 protein solution (2 μl) with the reservoir solution (2 μl), with the prior addition of 0.1 m l-cysteine (0.4 μl) to the reservoir. Large rod-shaped crystals grew overnight, and SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the crystallized material was in the native state (data not shown). The crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen using the reservoir solution as a cryoprotectant. X-ray Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—The crystals diffracted to 1.8 Å resolution and belong to space group P212121, with unit cell dimensions of a = 45.35 Å, b = 81.17 Å, c = 106.63 Å, consistent with one monomer/asymmetric unit. The data were merged and processed with the HKL suite (37Otwinowski Z. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38445) Google Scholar). Subsequent crystallographic and structural analysis was performed using the CCP4i interface (38Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab The structure was solved using the molecular replacement method (resolution range 10-4 Å) with the AMORE program (41Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). An initial search model was built using regions of the cleaved thermopin structure (1MTP) predicted to remain relatively unchanged in the native structure (residues 5-78, 168-309, and 333-367). The molecule packed well within the unit cell, and together with the unbiased features in the initial electron density maps, the correctness of the molecular replacement solution was confirmed. For structure refinement a hybrid model was created, based on the sequence alignment and structures of cleaved thermopin (1MTP) and native α1-antitrypsin (1QLP) (28Irving J.A. Cabrita L.D. Rossjohn J. Pike R.N. Bottomley S.P. Whisstock J.C. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Residues 5-78, 168-309, and 333-367 of cleaved thermopin were combined with residues 168-309 of a polyalanine α1-antitrypsin model. This was then superimposed with the molecular replacement solution to give a starting model. Maximum likelihood refinement using REFMAC (42Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13815) Google Scholar) produced a 10% drop in the Rcryst and Rfree (Rcryst = 32.9, Rfree = 36.9). The progress of refinement was monitored using the Rfree value. Iterative cycles of maximum likelihood refinement using REFMAC and model building in O (43Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) were used to further improve the model until there was no further drop in the Rfree value. A bulk solvent correction (Babinet model with mask) was used within REFMAC. Water molecules were added to the model using ARP/wARP when Rfree reached 30%. Solvent molecules were retained only if they had acceptable hydrogen bonding geometry contacts of 2.5-3.5 Å with protein atoms or with existing solvent and were in good 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density. At this stage, residues that could be modeled in two alternate conformations were included in the refinement. Disordered atoms in these residues were given occupancies of 0.5. The dimethylarsinoyl moiety was built into the model in the latter stages of refinement, using coordinates obtained from Ligand Depot (44Feng Z. Chen L. Maddula H. Akcan O. Oughtred R. Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 2153-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The final model contains residues -2-326, 333-367, 1 dimethylarsinoyl moiety, 5 sulfate groups, and 457 water molecules. It has an Rcryst of 18.7% and an Rfree of 22.2% for all reflections between 64 and 1.76 Å. All residues are in the most favored and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. A summary of statistics is provided in Table I. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1SNG). Kinetics—The stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) of bovine chymotrypsin by thermopin, ThermopinC41S, and arsenate-modified thermopin at 37 °C was performed as described (27Irving J.A. Steenbakkers P.J.

Structural Analysis—Hydrogen bonds (not including water-mediated bonds) were calculated using the WHATIF optimal hydrogen bonding network server (45Rodriguez R. Chinea G. Lopez N. Pons T. Vriend G. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Calculation of the number of salt bridges, the surface area, and α-helical content was also carried out using the WHATIF server. MolScript (46Kraulis P. J. Appl.

Cleaved and native thermopin structures were superimposed using the program PINQ (Ref. 48Lesk A.M. Levitt M. Chothia C.

By immobilizing Chinese hamster ovary cells in microcapillary tubes and heparin on sensor chips, we demonstrated that heparan sulfate-mediated cell retention of the major cardiotoxin (CTX) from the Taiwan cobra, CTX A3, near membrane surfaces is citrate-dependent. X-ray determination of a CTX A3-heparin hexasaccharide complex structure at 2.4 Å resolution revealed a molecular mechanism for toxin retention in which heparin-induced conformational changes of CTX A3 lead to citrate-mediated dimerization. A citrate ion bound to Lys-23 and Lys-31 near the tip of loop II stabilizes hydrophobic contact of the CTX A3 homodimer at the functionally important loop I and II regions. Additionally, the heparin hexasaccharide interacts with five CTX A3 molecules in the crystal structure, providing another mechanism whereby the toxin establishes a complex network of interactions that result in a strong interaction with cell surfaces presenting heparan sulfate. Our results suggest a novel role for venom citrate in biological activity and reveal a structural model that explains cell retention of cobra CTX A3 through heparan sulfate-CTX interactions.

Citrate is present as a major component of snake, bee, scorpion, and ant venom and serves as counter ion for the basic polypeptides of many venoms (1Odell G.V. Fenton A.W. Ownby C.L. Doss M.P. Schmidt J.O. Toxicon. 1999; 37: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For instance, ∼50 mm citrate is present in the Taiwan cobra (Naja atra) venom (2Francis B. Seebart C. Kaiser I.I. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1239-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The role of citrate as a divalent cationic chelator that inhibits calcium ion-dependent enzyme activity in venom storage glands has been established (2Francis B. Seebart C. Kaiser I.I. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1239-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The function of citrate in the envenomed host, however, remains elusive. Most interestingly, citrate serves as a buffer component and often mediates the monomerdimer equilibrium of many proteases for regulation of their catalytic activity by either stabilizing the active dimeric form or, indirectly, the protease oxyanion hole (3Batra R. Khayat R. Tong L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Citrate has been used in many protein crystallization studies and has been observed to be located at functionally important anionic binding pockets.

Nakato H. Selleck S.B. Turnbull J.E. Coath C. Cell Surface Proteoglycans in Signaling and Development. Human Frontier Science Program Workshop VI HFSP, Strasbourg, France1999Google Scholar). Heparin and HS are a class of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that are widely distributed in many tissues and cell types (6Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). They are negatively charged polymers composed of heterogeneous disaccharide repeating units of uronate-glucosamine (IdoUA/GlcUA-α1–4-GlcN). An uneven sulfation pattern, especially N-substitution differences, accounts for heterogeneity (7Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) and provides the structural basis for the specific binding of extracellular regulatory proteins to exert their biological functions. Glycosaminoglycans have also been suggested to play biological roles as regulators of the transport and effector functions of numerous extracellular regulatory proteins, including growth factors, proteases, lipoprotein lipase, chemokines, morphogens, and viral proteins (8Belting M.

Cobra cardiotoxins (CTXs) are basic proteins with different GAG binding specificities conferred by a cationic belt of the conserved residues and the availability of specific Lys residues (15Wu W. Trends Cardiovas. Med. 1998; 8: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). They constitute ∼50% of the venom by weight (16Lo T.B. Chen Y.H. Lee C.Y. J. Chinese Chem. Soc. 1966; 13: 25-37Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and are composed of 60–62 amino acids, with β-sheets forming three fingered loop structures (17Wu W. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1997; 16: 115-134Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). By binding to cell membranes, CTXs depolarize cardiomyocytes to cause systolic arrest in the envenomed victim. Most interestingly, heparin binding not only stabilizes the membrane-bound form of CTXs but also induces CTX aggregation (18Sue S. Chien K. Huang W. Abraham J.K. Chen K. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2666-2673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Vyas A.A. Pan J. Patel H.V. Vyas K.A. Chiang C. Sheu Y. Hwang J. Wu W. J. Biol.

Subcutaneous injection of cobra toxin in mice suggested that certain CTXs, unlike other venom components, remained at the sites of lesion by unknown molecular mechanisms (21Tseng L.F. Chiu T.H. Lee C.Y. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1968; 12: 526-535Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Lai M.K. Wen C.Y. Lee C.Y. J. Formosan Med. Assoc. 1972; 71: 328-332Google Scholar). Considering that various homologous CTXs from the venoms of N. atra and other cobras, Naja nigricollis and Naja mossambica, have diverse potential biological targets in a wide range of cell membranes, it is of interest to investigate whether the interaction of GAGs with CTXs plays a role in mediating tissue retention of specific CTX types and whether other venom components are also involved in retention. Materials—Crude snake venom (N. atra), heparin, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. CTXs were purified according to a published procedure (23Chien K.Y. Chiang C.M. Hseu Y.C. Vyas A.A. Rule G.S. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14473-14483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were determined to be at least 99% pure by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Anti-cardiotoxin antibody was prepared by immunoprecipitation of horse antiserum (Center for Disease Control Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan) with CTXs. Cell Retention Tests—Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1, ATCC number CCL-61) and GAG biosynthesis deficiency mutant CHO cells (pgsA745, ATCC number CRL-2242) were maintained in modified McCoy's 5A medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and 100% relative humidity. For performing retention tests in microcapillary pipettes, trypsinized cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were pipetted into 160-μl microcapillaries (VWR Scientific) that were maintained in tissue culture medium for 1 day prior to retention tests. A continuous flow system (10 μl/min) consisting of a syringe pump (ISCO Inc., Lincoln, NE) connected to a microcapillary tube with silicon tubing was employed for retention assays. Cells in the microcapillary tube were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) before CTX A3 application. Ten μl of CTX (2 μm in HBSS), segregated by two air bubbles to avoid dilution, were drawn through the microcapillary tube. The flow was stopped when the CTX A3 solution reached the outlet, and the cells were fixed with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min followed by blocking with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Control experiments with mouse anti-β-actin antibody and anti-mouse-IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were performed to ensure that the cells were evenly immobilized. An additional treatment with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS was performed before the blocking step for control experiments. CTX A3 retention by the cells was detected by immunostaining with a horse anti-CTX-antibody (1:2000) and a secondary anti-horse IgG antibody (1:2000) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA). After washing away unbound antibody, a chemilumi-nescence detection reagent (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) was added. The microcapillary tubes were then placed in contact with hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min for detection of cell staining. The distribution of staining along the microcapillaries was scanned and analyzed by image-editing software (Adobe Photoshop 7.01, Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA) and brightness/contrast adjustment (-50/+50%). High background staining due to the nonspecific binding of antibodies could be readily subtracted to reveal the distribution of specific staining as shown in Scheme 1. The average trailing edge of staining from replicate experiments was estimated as the position of half-maximal intensity and was a measurement of the retention of CTX A3 on immobilized CHO cells. Preparation of Heparin Derivatives—Biotinylated heparin was prepared by mixing high molecular weight (HMW) heparin with a 5-fold molar excess of NHS-LC-LC-biotin (Pierce). After 24 h at room temperature, the biotinylation reagent was removed by Sephadex G-15 chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Fully sulfated heparin hexasaccharide used for crystallization studies was prepared by heparinase I treatment of HMW heparin (24Yamada S. Murakami T. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8696-8705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Heparinase digestion results in oligosaccharides at their nonreducing termini with a common structure of a 4,5-unsaturated uronic acid derivative from either d-glucuronic acid or l-iduronic acid. It has the advantage of being a chromophore with maximum absorbance at 232 nm although it loses its original chemical identity. Strong anion exchanger chromatography (4.6 × 250 mm; Waters, Milford, MA) was performed with a 50-min linear gradient, 0.7–1.2 m NaCl, pH 3.5, at constant flow rate (1 ml/min) with absorbance monitoring at 232 nm. The fraction of fully sulfated heparin hexasaccharide was isolated, and its purity was characterized further on a single peak by repeated strong anion exchanger chromatography, and the obtained NMR spectra were greater than 99%. Chemically modified heparins (de-N-sulfated heparin, de-2-O-sulfated heparin, and de-6-O-sulfated heparin) were derived from HMW heparin (∼18 kDa) as described earlier (25Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 46: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 26Jaseja M. Rej R.N. Sauriol F. Perlin A.S. Can. J.

All heparin derivatives were characterized by one-dimensional 13C NMR to determine percentages of modification. Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Studies—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed on a Biacore X instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All experiments were conducted at 25 °C under continuous flow using various buffers as described under “Results.” Biotinylated heparin was immobilized on SA chips (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min to give surface densities of 700 RU. One RU corresponds to ∼1 pg of immobilized heparin per mm2. Streptavidin surfaces were used as references. Typically, toxins were injected over heparin surfaces at a flow rate of 40 μl/min under different buffer compositions (10 mm at pH 7.4, as indicated under “Results”), with 150 mm NaCl and 0.005% Tween 20. There was not any significant nonspecific binding to reference surfaces. Surfaces were regenerated by 30-s injections of 1.0 m NaCl. The amount of CTX binding at steady state (Req) was used to calculate the dissociation constants from Scatchard plots. The maximum capacities of heparin surfaces for CTX binding (Rmax) were also estimated from Scatchard plots. The retained fraction (%) indicated the fraction of bound CTXs as retained forms. It was defined as follows: retained fraction (%) = bound CTXs after 6 min of dissociation/bound CTXs before dissociation. The dissociation rate constants were estimated by using BIAevaluation version 3.2 (Biacore AB; Uppsala, Sweden). Several recent reviews (28Schuck P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 541-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 29Powell A.K. Yates E.A. Fernig D.G. Turnbull J.E. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: R17-R30Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 30Fernig D.G. Iozzo R.V. Proteoglycan Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 505-518Google Scholar) have indicated that the dissociation rate constant is often difficult to measure using surface-based techniques because of the existence of a layer of stationary liquid at the surface, which promotes rebinding. Nevertheless, numerical analysis for quantitative comparison is still possible, if certain assumptions are met. Crystallizations—Crystallization mixtures contained CTX A3 and heparin hexasaccharide in a molar ratio of 1:3 in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 200 mm NaCl. Precipitation immediately occurred when protein and heparin were mixed, and the solution became clear, and NaCl was added at a proper concentration. Crystallization was achieved using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 291 K with 1-μl hanging drops containing equal amounts of protein solution (10 mg/ml) and a reservoir solution containing 18% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, 18% (w/v) PEG4000, and 100 mm trisodium citrate dehydrate, pH 5.6. The crystals were visible after 2 days and reached a maximal dimension of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm3 in 2 weeks. Crystallographic Data Collection and Processing—By taking advantage of the 18% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol in crystallization solution, the crystals were mounted on a glass loop (0.2–0.3 mm) and directly flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen without any other cryo-protectant solution. X-ray diffraction data to 2.4 Å resolution were collected at 110 K using ADSC Q210 CCD detector at a wavelength of 1.127 Å on beamline BL17B2 at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, Hsinchu, Taiwan. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (31Otwinowski Z. Minnor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions of a = 43.74 Å, b = 59.25 Å, and c = 98.55 Å. There were two molecules per asymmetric unit according to estimated solvent content in a reasonable region.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 24-31Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar) as implemented in CNS v1.1 (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) using the N. atra CTX A6 monomer structure (PDB code 1UG4) as a search model. Two CTX A3 molecules were located in the unit cell after rotation and translation function searches. All refinement procedures were performed using CNS v.1.1. The composite omit electron density maps with coefficients |2Fo - Fc| were calculated and visualized using O v7.0 (34Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar), and the model was rebuilt and adjusted iteratively as required. Throughout the refinement, a random selection (5%) of the data were set aside as a “free data set,” and the model was refined against the rest of data with F ≥ 0 as a working data set (35Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). The dimeric protein model was initially refined by rigid-body refinement using the data from 25.0 to 3.5 Å resolution, where the group B values were first restrained to 20.0 Å2. This refinement was followed by simulated annealing using a slow cooling protocol with a starting temperature 2500 K, provided in CNS, applied to data between 25.0 and 2.4 Å. The bulk solvent correction was then applied, and group B factors were adjusted. An elongated extra density stretching out from one CTX A3 molecule of the dimer was clearly visible and recognized as the hexasaccharide heparin in σA-weighted |Fo - Fc| maps. In order to enhance the density fitting, another x-ray diffraction data with a longer wavelength of 1.7412 Å was collected by the sulfur single-wavelength anomalous scattering (data were collected on the Taiwan contract beamline BL12B2 of SPring-8 in Japan; statistics not shown here). The sulfur anomalous difference Fourier maps showed clear sulfide peaks and allowed the heparin molecule to be adjusted and fitted into the electron density map. Moreover, considerable density was present between the dimer interface surrounded by 4 lysines (residue 23 and 31 from two molecules) and was well fitted with a citrate molecule that was used in crystallization buffer. The refinement then proceeded with another cycle of simulated annealing with a slow cooling protocol with a starting temperature of 1000 K. The heparin molecule was adjusted iteratively, and in the sugar unit the omitted electron density maps were followed by energy minimization and group B-factor refinement. Finally, the PICKWATER subroutine from CNS served to define peaks in difference maps (3σ cut-off level) to locate 24 water molecules automatically. Model Validation—The final model of CTX A3 and heparin complex contains 930 non-hydrogen protein atoms for the dimeric CTX A3, 105 hexasaccharide atoms for heparin molecule, and 13 citrate atoms. The refinement statistics are given in Table I. The correctness of stereo-chemistry of the model was verified using PROCHECK (36Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The calculations of r.m.s. deviations from ideality (37Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2533) Google Scholar) for bonds, angles, and dihedral and improper angles performed in CNS showed satisfactory stereochemistry. In a Ramachandran plot (38Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar), all main chain dihedral angles were in the most favored and additionally allowed regions. The torsion angles for heparin hexasaccharide were also compared with available coordinates and were found to be consistent with the energy minima determined previously (39Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 40Mikhailov D. Linhardt R.J. Mayo K.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The accessible surface area of CTX A3 was calculated by FastSurf (41Tsodikov O.V. Record Jr., M.T. Sergeev Y.V. J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The van der Waals radius was assigned using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. Coordinates—Atomic coordinates for the crystal structure of CTX A3 and heparin complex described in this paper have been deposited in the PDB (code 1XT3). Retention of CTX A3 on Immobilized CHO Cells in Capillary Tubes—CTX A3 binding to immobilized CHO cells was determined according to Scheme 1. As shown in Fig. 1, although there was no significant difference of the cell retention of CTX A3 by mutant cells (pgsA745 that are deficient in GAG biosynthesis) and wild-type cells (CHO-K1 expressing GAGs) in HBSS, the addition of 10 mm citrate significantly increased toxin retention by wild-type cells but not mutant cells. These results suggest that GAGs on CHO cell surfaces play a role in mediating the retention of CTX A3 in the presence of citrate. Citrate-induced Retention of CTX A3 on Heparin Surfaces— As we have demonstrated previously that CTX A3 binds preferably to GAG heparin/HS, we carried out a more sensitive and quantitative binding analysis of the CTX-heparin interaction by surface plasmon resonance. As shown in Fig. 2A, the profiles obtained for CTX A3 binding to heparin surfaces is buffer composition-dependent. In HEPES and Tris buffers, binding reached equilibrium at higher toxin concentrations, and the toxin dissociated relatively rapidly with reasonable fitting to a monoexponential decay model, giving an observed dissociation rate constant of ∼2 × 10-2 s-1. In citrate and phosphate buffers, however, an initial fast association was followed by a much slower second phase of binding when 0.1–6 μm CTX A3 was injected over an immobilized heparin surface at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. The dissociation phases in phosphate and citrate buffers were distinctly biphasic and could be best fitted to a double exponential decay model that gave apparent dissociation rate constants of 6 × 10-2 s-1 for fast dissociation components and 5 × 10-4 s-1 for slow dissociation components. The huge difference (∼100-folded) in rate constants for the two dissociation phases indicates the presence of two distinct populations of CTX A3 molecules on the heparin surface. Plots of the accumulated responses versus log concentration (Fig. 2B) were characterized by points of inflection indicating that the heparin surface was saturable and that the accumulation of CTX A3 was associated with heparin binding. Scatchard analyses of the binding data were highly unusual with the lower concentration data giving positive slopes for all four buffers. The fact that equilibrium was only approached in some instances does not significantly contribute to these unusual profiles. The positive slopes are indicative of positive cooperativity observed at lower CTX A3 concentrations. The negative slope regions of the Scatchard plots indicated that phosphate and citrate buffers increased the observed dissociation constants for CTX A3 binding to heparin. Based on the least square linear fitting of the data, the observed dissociation constants are estimated to be 0.37 ± 0.03 and 2.01 ± 0.09 μm in the presence of HEPES and citrate buffer (10 mm), respectively. The observed slow dissociation rates are interpreted as being due to the citrate-induced oligomerization of CTX A3. However, we found no evidence for citrate-induced oligomerization of CTX A3 in the absence of heparin by diffusion constant measurements by both NMR and analytical ultracentrifugation of CTX A3 in the presence of citrate (data not shown). Because we have demonstrated previously that the interaction of heparin with CTX A3 stabilized the membrane-bound conformation of CTX A3 (18Sue S. Chien K. Huang W. Abraham J.K. Chen K. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2666-2673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), citrate-induced oligomerization probably occurs only in the presence of heparin binding through heparin-induced CTX A3 conformational change. Further SPR experiments were therefore performed in the presence of citrate to understand the molecular mechanism and biological significance. Characterization of CTXA3 Retention in the Presence of Citrate—The retention of CTX A3 on heparin surfaces was measured as a function of citrate concentration. As shown in Fig. 3A, the amount of CTX A3 retention (as reflected by the slow dissociation phase indicated by the arrows shown in Fig. 3A) and the retained fraction relative to total binding significantly increased with increasing citrate concentration. However, in the presence of citrate, higher CTX A3 concentrations are needed in order to achieve similar amounts of CTX A3 binding as evidenced by the increasing CTX A3 concentrations needed to achieve ∼2000 RU of binding. This observation is consistent with the Scatchard plot analyses of the data for binding in different buffers, indicating that citrate ions reduced the binding of CTXA3 to heparin (Fig. 2C). Reducing the flow rate for the injection of a constant volume and constant concentration of CTX A3 over heparin surfaces in citrate-buffered saline increased the amount of CTX A3 retention, indicating that retention was time-dependent (Fig. 3B). To rule out that this was a flow rate effect, increasing volumes of a constant CTX A3 concentration were injected over a heparin surface at constant flow rate (Fig. 3C). Increasing amounts of retention were observed with increasing volume, again indicating that retention was time-dependent.

PKC phosphorylates serines 744/748 within the PKD1 catalytic domain, and this is proposed to be necessary and sufficient for enzyme activation. Hence, a PKD1 mutant with alanine substituted at positions 744 and 748 (PKD-S744A/S748A) is catalytically inactive. Conversely, a PKD1 mutant with glutamic residues substituted at positions 744 and 748 as phospho-mimics (PKD-S744E/S748E) is constitutively active when expressed in Cos7 or HeLa cells. The present study reveals that Ser-744/Ser-748 phosphorylation is required for PKD1 activation in lymphocytes. However, PKD-S744E/S748E is not constitutively active but, like the wild type enzyme, requires antigen receptor triggering or phorbol ester stimulation. Antigen receptor activation of wild type PKD is dependent on phospholipase C (PLC)/diacylglycerol (DAG) and PKC, whereas PKD-S744E/S748E is only dependent on PLC/DAG but no longer requires PKC. Hence, substitution of serines 744 and 748 with glutamic residues as phospho-mimics bypasses the PKC requirement for PKD1 activation but does not bypass the need for antigen receptors, PLC, or DAG. In lymphocytes, PKD1 is, thus, not regulated by PLC and PKC in a linear pathway; rather, PKD1 activation has more stringent requirements for integration of dual PLC signals, one mediated by PKCs and one that is PKC-independent.

PKDs are highly expressed in lymphocytes and are strongly and selectively activated by the T cell antigen receptor, B cell receptor (BCR), and FcϵR1 in T cells, B cells, and mast cells, respectively (6Matthews S.A.

PKD expression is strongest in the thymus, where it is activated by the pre-T cell antigen receptor complex in T cell precursors (9Marklund U. Lightfoot K. Cantrell D. Immunity. 2003; 19: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In these cells active PKD1 can substitute for the pre-T cell antigen receptor and induce substantial thymocyte proliferation and differentiation (9Marklund U. Lightfoot K. Cantrell D. Immunity. 2003; 19: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PKDs have an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that forms a high affinity binding site for diacylglycerol (DAG) or tumor-promoting phorbol esters (4Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 10Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Valverde A.M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). DAG or phorbol ester binding to PKDs controls the intracellular localization of these enzymes and originally resulted in their designation as PKC isoforms. However, PKDs are structurally and catalytically distinct to PKCs with different substrate specificities and modes of regulation (2Van Lint J. Rykx A. Maeda Y. Vantus T. Sturany S. Malhotra V.

Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In fact, the relationship between PKCs and PKD1 is a regulatory one, as in a variety of cell lineages stimulation of PKCs is necessary for PKD activation (6Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Zugaza J.L. Waldron R.T. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The role of PKCs in PKD1 activation is explained by their ability to phosphorylate serines 744 and 748 within the PKD1 catalytic domain (13Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Ser-744 and Ser-748 is crucial for PKD1 activation in epithelial cells as substitution of these residues with alanines creates a catalytically dead kinase (15Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Conversely, substitutions of acidic residues at Ser-744 and Ser-748 as a phospho-mimic has been shown to render PKD1 constitutively active in Cos7 and HeLa cells (15Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 16Storz P. Doppler H. Toker A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2614-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The importance of PKCs for PKD1 activation explains why PKD1 is regulated by phospholipase C (PLC), which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate, producing DAG, thereby activating PKCs. Current models for PKD1 activation, thus, propose that the role of DAG or phorbol esters in PKD1 activation reflects DAG requirements for PKC activation. PKC activation of PKD1 in fibroblasts occurs at the plasma membrane and involves scaffolding proteins such as the protein kinase A-anchoring protein AKAP-Lbc (17Rey O. Reeve Jr., J.R. Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34361-34372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Carnegie G.K. Smith F.D. McConnachie G. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 889-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). DAG is also required for the colocalization of PKD1 and PKC to allow PKC-mediated transphosphorylation of PKD (17Rey O. Reeve Jr., J.R. Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34361-34372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is proposed that the PKD N terminus maintains the molecule in an inactive conformation, which is relieved by phosphorylation of Ser-744 and Ser-748 by PKCs (14Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this minimal model the phosphorylation of Ser-744/Ser-748 is sufficient for PKD1 stimulation (13Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Yuan J. Slice L. Walsh J.H. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17114-17121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). One basis for this conclusion is that a PKD1 mutant with glutamic residues substituted at positions 744 and 748 as phospho-mimics (PKD-S744E/S748E) is constitutively active in Cos7 and HeLa cells. PKD-S744E/S748E has, thus, been used as a “gain of function” mutant in a variety of studies that probe the functional role of PKD1 (16Storz P. Doppler H. Toker A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2614-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 22Storz P. Doeppler H. Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 870-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Vega R.B.

Current models for PKD1 regulation are based on experiments performed in fibroblasts or epithelial cells in the context of G protein-coupled receptor agonists, receptor-tyrosine kinases, or oxidative stress. However, PKD1 shows different patterns of intracellular localization in different cell types (24Matthews S. Iglesias T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Liljedahl M. Maeda Y. Colanzi A. Ayala I. Van Lint J. Malhotra V.

Science. 2002; 295: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) that could influence its ability to respond to different stimuli. Indeed, the PKC isoform that mediates PKC activation can differ between different cell types; PKCδ controls PKD1 activation by oxidative stress in HeLa cells (16Storz P. Doppler H. Toker A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2614-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), whereas PKCϵ is necessary for G protein-coupled receptor stimulation of PKD1 in Swiss 3T3 cells (17Rey O. Reeve Jr., J.R. Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34361-34372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). There is also evidence for divergence in PKD1 regulation by different stimuli, as in HeLa cells the phosphorylation of tyrosine 463 was important for PKD1 activation in response to oxidative stress but not for PKD1 activation by a receptor-tyrosine kinase, the platelet derived growth factor receptor (27Storz P. Doppler H. Johannes F.J. Toker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17969-17976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In lymphocytes the role of PKC-mediated phosphorylation of PKD1 has not been explored. In this context recent results argue that one cannot extrapolate data about PKD regulation in fibroblasts to lymphocytes. For example, G protein-coupled receptor activation of PKD1 in fibroblasts is dependent on plasma membrane translocation of the enzyme, whereas antigen receptor stimulation of PKD lymphocytes is not (6Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 34361-34372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the object of the present study was to explore the role of PKC-mediated phosphorylation of PKD1 in lymphocytes. The results reveal that PKD1 activation in lymphocytes has stringent requirements for integration of dual PLC signals; that is, one mediated by PKCs and one that is PKC-independent. The ability of PLC/DAG to regulate PKD1 independently of Ser-744/Ser-748 phosphorylation has not been observed previously and indicates that the extracellular signaling requirements for PKD1 differ dependent on the experimental model. cDNA Constructs—cDNA constructs encoding wild type PKD1 and various PKD1 mutants in the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector have been described previously: PKD1 wild type, PKDΔPH, PKD-S744A/S748A, PKD-S744E/S748E, and PKD-P155G/P287G (15Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 19Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). cDNA constructs encoding a chimeric fusion protein between green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the above PKD1 mutants were generated by subcloning an EcoRI cDNA fragment encoding the PKD1 constructs into the EcoRI site of pEF-plink2-GFPC3 (7Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) to generate a GFP-PKD expression vector. Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation before use in transient transfection experiments. Cell Preparation and Stimulation—The BALB/c mouse B lymphoma line A20 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. The human T lymphoma line Jurkat 6.2 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The chicken B lymphoma DT40 line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% chicken serum. Transient transfection of the A20 B cell lymphoma cell line has been described previously (7Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The Jurkat human T-cell lymphoma line was transiently transfected by electroporation at 140 V, 1000 microfarads using a 2-mm cuvette (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell). Transient transfection of the DT40 chicken B cell lymphoma line as well as a DT40 PLCγ2-/- cell line (30Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) was carried out using the described previously A20 protocol, with the exception that the cuvettes were chilled on ice for 10 min both pre- and post-electroporation. To inhibit the action of PKC in intact cells, lymphocytes were preincubated with medium alone or 5 μm GF109203X for 20 min at 37 °C before cell stimulation. To monitor PKD1 activity in intact cells, lymphocytes were stimulated with medium alone or 20 ng/ml phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate for 10 min at 37 °C. Ligation of the A20 and DT40 BCR was carried out by adding, respectively, 10 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fragment (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) (A20) or 20 μg/ml anti-chicken IgM monoclonal antibody M4 (DT40) for 10 min at 37 °C. Unless otherwise indicated stimulated cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to Western blot analysis. Cell Lysis and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed for 10 min at 4 °C (20 × 106 cells/ml) using 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm iodoacetamide, 2 μm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Soluble proteins were concentrated by precipitation with 1.5 volumes of acetone and separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected by Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies. The Ser(P)-916 and C-terminal pan-PKD antiserums have been described previously and were used to detect PKD1 activity and expression levels, respectively (31Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26543-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The Ser(P)-744/Ser-748 PKD antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and used at 1:1000 to detect phosphorylation of Ser-744 and Ser-748 on PKD1. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). PKD Ser-744 and Ser-748 Are Necessary for Optimal PKD Activation in Lymphocytes—Activation of PKD1 catalytic activity results in immediate autophosphorylation of PKD1 on a C-terminal autophosphorylation site, serine 916 (31Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26543-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Accordingly, PKD1 catalytic activity in vivo (i.e. in an intact cell) can be monitored using antisera generated against a phosphoserine 916 peptide that selectively recognizes PKD1 molecules autophosphorylated on Ser-916. The phosphoserine 916 (Ser(P)-916) antisera has been used extensively to monitor PKD1 activity in human and murine lymphocyte cell lines and primary lymphocytes (6Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26543-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of A20 B cell lymphoma cells with phosphoserine 916 antisera (Fig. 1A) showed that PKD1 is inactive in lymphocytes unless cells are stimulated by B cell antigen receptor ligation or after exposure to the phorbol ester phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), a pharmacological mimic of DAG. PKD1 activation in fibroblasts is mediated by phosphorylation of residues Ser-744 and Ser-748 in the catalytic domain of the enzyme (14Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Waldron R.T. Rey O. Zhukova E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27482-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Ser-744/Ser-748 can be monitored by Western blot analysis with specific phospho-antisera. The data (Fig. 1A) show that both phorbol ester and antigen receptor activation of PKD1 in lymphocytes is accompanied by phosphorylation of Ser-744/Ser-748. Moreover, the time course of Ser-744/Ser-748 phosphorylation and PKD1 activation are coincident; the phosphorylation of Ser-744/Ser-748 and autophosphorylation of PKD1 on Ser-916 is, thus, a rapid and sustained response to antigen receptor engagement. To determine whether phosphorylation of Ser-744/Ser-748 is necessary for PKD1 activation, the activity of a PKD1 mutant with alanine substitutions at Ser-744/Ser-748 was monitored (PKD-S744A/S748A). The PKD1 constructs used for these experiments were tagged with GFP. Western blot analysis with phosphoserine 916 antisera showed antigen receptor activation and PDBu stimulation of B cells strongly induced the catalytic activity of wild type PKD1, but this response was strikingly reduced in the PKD-S744A/S748A mutant (Fig. 1B), although it was not completely abrogated. The Role of the PKD1 CRD in PKD1 Activation in Lymphocytes—There are two cysteine-rich motifs (C1a and C1b) within the CRD of PKD1 that are required for the enzyme to bind DAG with high affinity and control the intracellular localization of the enzyme (26Baron C.L. Malhotra V. Science. 2002; 295: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 29Iglesias T. Matthews S. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 33Maeda Y. Beznoussenko G.V. Van Lint J. Mironov A.A. Malhotra V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5982-5990Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). DAG binding to PKD is proposed to colocalize PKCs to facilitate Ser-744/Ser-748 phosphorylation, but the role of DAG binding to PKD1 for enzyme activation in lymphocytes has not been fully assessed. Previous studies have shown that PKD-P287G, a PKD1 mutant with a mutated C1b domain that has lost ∼90% of its DAG/phorbol ester binding capacity, can still be activated in response to antigen receptor triggering (6Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 29Iglesias T. Matthews S. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, this result does not fully resolve the role of DAG binding for PKD1 activation because PKD-P287G has residual capacity to bind DAG/phorbol esters via its low affinity C1a domain. Accordingly, we examined the activity of a second PKD1 mutant containing substitutions of prolines 155 and 287 with glycine, which disables both the C1a and C1b domains of PKD1, resulting in complete loss of DAG/phorbol ester binding. The data in Fig. 2 show Western blot analysis with Ser-916 antisera of B cells transfected with PKD-P155G/P287G and revealed that this mutant could not respond normally to phorbol ester stimulation. Thus, PKD-P155G/P287G is effectively catalytically inactive, indicating that PKD1 activation by phorbol esters in lymphocytes requires a functional DAG binding domain. The failure of PKD-P155G/P287G to respond to phorbol ester treatment correlates with the failure of this PKD1 mutant to be phosphorylated on Ser-744/Ser-748 (Fig. 2). These data are compatible with a model whereby DAG binding to PKD1 is necessary to allow the enzyme to be transphosphorylated by PKC at Ser-744/Ser-748. Phosphorylation of PKD1 Ser-744 and Ser-748 Is Not Sufficient for PKD1 Activation in Lymphocytes—The data above indicate that phosphorylation of Ser-744/Ser-748 is important for PKD activation in lymphocytes. To explore if phosphorylation of Ser-744/Ser-748 is sufficient for PKD1 activation in lymphocytes, the activity of PKD1 molecules with acidic amino acid substitutions at Ser-744 and Ser-748 as phospho-mimics was examined (PKD-S744E/S748E). This PKD1 mutant is constitutively active in Cos7 and HeLa cells (15Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 16Storz P. Doppler H. Toker A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2004; 24: 8374-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 3A compare the activity of endogenous wild type PKD1 and PKD-S744E/S748E in a stable A20 cell line expressing GFP-PKD-S744E/S748E. The data show that PKD-S744E/S748E was not constitutively active in these B cells. Rather, optimal activation of PKD-S744E/S748E was only induced in response to antigen receptor triggering or phorbol ester stimulation. The time course for activation of PKD-S744E/S748E was similar to that of endogenous PKD1; activation was both rapid and sustained for up to several hours (Fig. 3B). The activity of PKD-S744E/S748E was also examined in a T cell population, the Jurkat T leukemic cell line. Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with wild type PKD1 and PKD-S744E/S748E (Fig. 3C). There was a small increase in basal activity of the PKD-S744E/S748E, as seen in B cells, but optimal activity of this PKD1 mutant was only seen once the T cells were activated. Deletion of the PKD1 Pleckstrin Homology (PH)-like Domain Creates a Constitutively Active Kinase in Lymphocytes—One explanation for the failure of PKD-S744E/S748E to be constitutively active in lymphocytes is that acidic substitutions as Ser-744/Ser-748 do not act as phospho-mimics. However, PKD-S744E/S748E has been shown to be constitutively active in Cos7 cells and HeLa cells and has been used in a number of studies to probe PKD functions (16Storz P. Doppler H. Toker A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2614-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 22Storz P. Doeppler H. Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 870-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Vega R.B.

The phosphorylation of Ser-744/Ser-748 is proposed to relieve N-terminal inhibition of the PKD1 catalytic domain by the PKD1 PH-like domain (14Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Because acidic amino acid substitutions of Ser-744 and Ser-748 were not sufficient to activate PKD1 in lymphocytes, the impact of PKD1 PH domain deletion on PKD1 activity in lymphocytes was explored. The activities of wild type PKD1, PKD-S744E/S748E, and PKDΔPH, a PKD1 construct with a deletion of the PH domain (amino acids 429 to 557), were compared (Fig. 4). These constructs were all fused to the C terminus of GFP so that they could be readily distinguished from endogenous PKD1. The different PKD1 mutant constructs were transiently transfected (separately) into A20 cells, and their activity was analyzed by monitoring autophosphorylation of Ser-916. The data (Fig. 4) show that PKDΔPH exhibited substantial basal activity in unstimulated cells, whereas wild type PKD1 (both endogenous and GFP-tagged) and PKD-S744E/S748E were not. Activation of lymphocytes with phorbol ester robustly stimulated the activity of wild type PKD1 and PKD-S744E/S748E. In contrast, phorbol ester stimulation did not further enhance the activity of PKDΔPH, indicating that this mutant is maximally active when expressed in lymphocytes. The Role of PLC and PKC in Antigen Receptor Regulation of Wild Type PKD1 Versus PKD-S744E/S748E—Antigen receptor regulation of PKD1 is mediated by a PLC/DAG/PKC pathway (8Matthews S.A. Dayalu R. Thompson L.J. Scharenberg A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9086-9091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ser-744 and Ser-748 in PKD1 are direct substrates for PKCs (14Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that the PLC/PKC requirement for antigen receptor activation of PKD1 is wholly explained by the requirement of these molecules for antigen receptor-induced phosphorylation of PKD1 at Ser-744/Ser-748. To test this hypothesis we examined Ser-744/Ser-748 phosphorylation of PKD1 in a DT40 B cell line where the antigen receptor-coupled PLC, PLCγ2, was ablated by homologous recombination, and the BCR is unable to induce hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate and, hence, cannot generate inositol polyphosphates or DAG (30Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). DT40 and DT40 PLCγ2-/- cells were stimulated via cross-linking the BCR or by treatment with PDBu. The data (Fig. 5A) show that PKD1 is not phosphorylated on Ser-744/Ser-748 in quiescent DT40 cells. In wild type DT40 cells both BCR and PDBu stimulation results in the phosphorylation of PKD1 on Ser-744/Ser-748. In PLCγ2-/- DT40s, BCR stimulation was unable to induce DAG production (the physiological stimulus for PKC) and was also unable to induce phosphorylation of PKD1 at Ser-744/Ser-748 (Fig. 5A). However, PDBu (a pharmacological mimic of DAG that can bypass the loss of PLCγ to activate PKC directly) induced a robust PKD1 Ser-744/Ser-748 phosphorylation in PLCγ2-/- DT40 cells. To probe the involvement of PKCs in Ser-744/Ser-748 phosphorylation of PKD1 in lymphocytes, the effects of the PKC inhibitor GF109203X on either PDBu- or BCR-stimulated DT40 cells was examined. The catalytic domains of PKCs and PKD are so divergent that PKC inhibitors such as GF109203X have no direct action on PKD (34Paolucci L. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: 33-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the data (Fig. 5A) showed that phosphorylation of PKD1 on Ser-744/Ser-748 in BCR- and PDBu-treated wild type DT40 cells is prevented by the addition of the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. In DT40 cells lacking PLCγ2 only PDBu activation resulted in phosphorylation of Ser-744/Ser-748, and this response was also prevented by GF109203X. Antigen receptor-induced phosphorylation of PKD1 on Ser-744/Ser-748 was, thus, dependent on both PLC and PKC. Phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of PKD1 was only dependent on PKC. The results above indicate that PKD1 activation in lymphocytes conforms in part to the models derived from fibroblast experiments, namely, that PLC and PKC regulate PKD1 via phosphorylation of Ser-744 and Ser-748. However, there is the question of what signaling pathways are used by antigen receptors to regulate the activity of the PKD-S744E/S748E mutant in which the key PKC substrate serines are substituted with glutamic acid as a phospho-mimic. To explore this issue wild type or PLCγ2 null DT40 cells were transfected with the PKD-S744E/S748E mutant and subsequently stimulated with either PDBu or BCR cross-linking. PKD1 activity was monitored by Western blot analysis with the Ser(P)-916 antisera. The data show that in wild type DT40 cells the PKD-S744E/S748E mutant has low basal activity but can be strongly activated by either BCR ligation or PDBu treatment. In PLCγ2-/- DT40 cells PKD-S744E/S748E could not be activated by BCR ligation, although it remained sensitive to PDBu (Fig. 5B). PDBu could activate PKD-S744E/S748E by directly binding to the enzyme itself, or alternatively, PDBu could induce PKC mediated phosphorylations of PKD1 at sites additional to Ser-744/748. The PKC requirement for PDBu activation of PKD-S744E/S748E was, therefore, investigated by examining the effects of the PKC inhibitor GF109203X on PDBu stimulation of the PKD-S744E/S748E mutant. The data (Fig. 5C) showed that PDBu-mediated activation of PKD-S744E/S748E is insensitive to the addition of GF109203X. This is in marked contrast to the effects of the PKC inhibitor on the endogenous enzyme; activation of endogenous wild type PKD1 was abrogated when cells were treated with GF109203X (Fig. 5C). The effect of GF109203X on antigen receptor activation of PKD-S744E/S748E was also examined. The data (Fig. 5D) confirmed that antigen receptor activation of endogenous PKD1 was inhibited when cells were pretreated with GF109203X but that the PKD-S744E/S748E mutant remained maximally active under these conditions. PKD-S744E/S748E is, thus, no longer dependent on PKC for activation. The present data reveal that PKD1 activation in lymphocytes requires PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-744 and Ser-748. Hence, inhibition of PKC or mutation of these two serines to alanine inhibits antigen receptor activation of PKD1 (6Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The requirement for PKC phosphorylation of Ser-744 and Ser-748 in PKD1, thus, seems to be essential for PKD1 activation in a variety of cell lineages and for diverse stimuli. However, the present study has found a key difference between PKD1 regulation in lymphocytes and some other cell types. Notably, mutation of Ser-744 and Ser-748 to glutamic acid as phospho-mimics is sufficient for PKD1 activation in HeLa and Cos7 cells (15Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 16Storz P. Doppler H. Toker A. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Accordingly, PKD-S744E/S748E is used increasingly as a constitutively active mutant to probe the cellular function of PKD (16Storz P. Doppler H. Toker A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2614-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 22Storz P. Doeppler H. Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 870-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Vega R.B. Harrison B.C. Meadows E. Roberts C.R. Papst P.J. Olson E.N. McKinsey T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8374-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The data herein show PKD-S744E/S748E was not constitutively active in lymphocytes but remained dependent on antigen receptor triggering or phorbol ester stimulation for optimal activation. The present results, thus, make two key points; first, PKD1 activation mechanisms differ in different cells, and second, PKD-S744E/S748E should be used cautiously as a research tool as it is not constitutively active in all cells. It has been proposed that the phosphorylation of activation loop serines 744 and 748 in the PKD1 catalytic domain relieves PKD1 PH domain-mediated autoinhibition and stabilizes PKD1 in an active conformation (14Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The PKD1 PH domain has an autoinhibitory action on PKD1 catalytic function in lymphocytes as its deletion creates a constitutively active enzyme. The low basal activity of the PKD-S744E/S748E mutant compared with the high activity of PKDΔPH in lymphocytes is consistent with a model whereby the catalytic domain of PKD-S744E/S748E is still subject to N-terminal inhibition in quiescent lymphocytes and that antigen receptor or phorbol ester stimulation activates PKD-S744E/S748E by relieving this N-terminal inhibition. Experiments in PLCγ2 null lymphocytes show that antigen receptor-induced activation of PKD-S744E/S748E and the wild type enzyme were both dependent on PLC stimulation. Hence, PLC can regulate PKD1 independent of its role in regulating PKC-mediated transphosphorylation of Ser-744/Ser-748. Strikingly, antigen receptor or phorbol ester stimulation of PKD-S744E/S748E is not prevented by pretreatment of cells with PKC inhibitors, in marked contrast to the behavior of the wild type enzyme. Hence, mutation of PKD1 Ser-744 and Ser-748 to glutamic residues is a phospho-mimic substitute for PKC but not antigen receptor activation. PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-744/Ser-748 is, thus, not sufficient to explain antigen receptor activation of PKD1, and an additional antigen receptor/PLC generated signal is required that is independent of PKC. The PLC-dependent/PKC autonomous step for PKD1 activation is mediated by DAG since phorbol esters, pharmacological mimics of DAG, can bypass the loss of PLC and stimulate PKD-S744E/S748E activation in PLCγ null lymphocytes. Previously, the role of DAG/phorbol esters in PKD1 activation was attributed to a DAG requirement for PKC activation and colocalization with PKD1 (17Rey O. Reeve Jr., J.R. Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34361-34372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A simple hypothesis to explain PKC-independent but DAG-mediated PKD1 activation is that direct binding of DAG to the CRD of PKD-S744E/S748E is required to release the PKD1 catalytic domain from N-terminal inhibition. The caveat is that the PKD1 CRD domain plays a key role in determining the subcellular localization of the enzyme, and it is possible that DAG binding to the CRD of PKD-S744E/S748E correctly localizes the enzyme for additional regulation by some other stimulus. In this respect, PKD1 activation in lymphocytes does not appear to require plasma membrane translocation of the enzyme since mutation of the C1b domain alone, which prevents relocation of PKD1 to the plasma membrane, does not prevent antigen receptor activation of the enzyme (6Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As well, PKD1 activation precedes plasma membrane translocation in lymphocytes and appears to occur in the cell interior (7Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A requirement for PLC activation and DAG production independent of the DAG requirement for PKC-mediated phosphorylation of PKD1 has not been previously recognized in HeLa cells and Cos7 cells (15Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 16Storz P. Doppler H. Toker A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2614-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) because substitutions of acidic residues for Ser-744/Ser-748 is sufficient to activate PKD1 in these cells. This would suggest that there is sufficient endogenous DAG to activate PKD-S744E/S748E in some cell populations, whereas in lymphocytes endogenous DAG levels are limiting in the absence of antigen receptor engagement. Many factors determine levels of endogenous DAG including the relative expression and activity of DAG kinases. In this instance DAG kinases are known to be important regulatory enzymes in lymphocytes (36Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 37Zhong X.P. Hainey E.A. Olenchock B.A. Jordan M.S. Maltzman J.S. Nichols K.E. Shen H. Koretzky G.A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and may contribute to keeping DAG levels low in quiescent cells. Another factor to consider is that the ability of endogenous DAG to saturate PKD1 will be influenced by the intracellular concentration of PKD1. It could, thus, be relevant that PKD1 is extremely abundant in lymphocytes and is expressed at 10–100-fold higher levels than in most fibroblasts and epithelial cells. 2C. D. Wood, unpublished data. Hence, even if endogenous DAG levels are equal, DAG will be rate-limiting in a cell with very high levels of PKD1. A further complication is that cells can express multiple DAG-binding proteins including the different DAG kinase isoforms, PKCs, and the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange proteins Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing proteins (38Spitaler M. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). DAG availability to PKD1 would inevitably be influenced by the presence of these competing DAG-binding proteins, and DAG might be rate-limiting for PKD1 activation in cells where the ratio of PKD1 to other DAG-binding proteins is low. It could also be significant that PKD1 can have quite different patterns of intracellular location in different cell lineages (24Matthews S. Iglesias T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Liljedahl M. Maeda Y. Colanzi A. Ayala I. Van Lint J. Malhotra V. Cell. 2001; 104: 409-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 26Baron C.L. Malhotra V. Science. 2002; 295: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and different intracellular membranes may contain different molecular species of DAG that differ in their affinity for PKD1. Different positioning of PKDs inside cells would inevitably influence the basal levels of DAG to which the enzyme is exposed. For example, HeLa cells are one model system in which PKD-S744E/S748E mutant is constitutively active (16Storz P. Doppler H. Toker A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2614-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These cells express very low levels of PKD1 relative to lymphocytes and also exhibit spontaneous trans-Golgi localization of PKD1 that is mediated by the CRD or DAG/phorbol ester binding region of the enzyme (33Maeda Y. Beznoussenko G.V. Van Lint J. Mironov A.A. Malhotra V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5982-5990Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). If there is sufficient DAG in trans-Golgi membranes of HeLa cells to recruit PKD1, this could also be sufficient to basally activate the PKD-S744E/S748E mutant. By contrast, in quiescent lymphocytes PKD1 is cytosolic and not discernibly in contact with endogenous membranes, Golgi or otherwise, before antigen receptor triggering (7Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This is an indication that PKD1 does not spontaneously bind DAG in quiescent lymphocytes either due to very low basal levels of DAG in lymphocyte membranes or because there are other competing DAG-binding proteins already in situ that prevent DAG/PKD1 interactions. In summary, the present data describe PKD1 regulatory mechanisms in antigen receptor-activated lymphocytes and reveal that PKD1 is not regulated by DAG and PKC in a linear pathway; rather, PKD1 activation has more stringent requirements for integration of two DAG signals, one mediated by PKCs and the other independent of this family of serine kinases. This second pathway can either be intrinsic or be regulated by extracellular stimuli and probably reflects a requirement for DAG binding to the PKD1 CRD to relieve N-terminal inhibition of the PKD1 catalytic domain.

https://openalex.org/W2102798170,"In this report, we describe the identification of a polypeptide survival-promoting factor that is produced by maternal and early postnatal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the immune system in Long-Evans rats and humans. The factor, termed Y-P30, most likely arises from proteolytic processing of a larger precursor protein and accumulates mainly in pyramidal neurons of the developing cortex and hippocampus but not in astrocytes. It was released from neurons grown in culture and substantially promotes survival of cells in explant monocultures of perinatal thalamus from the offspring. Y-P30 mRNA was not detectable in infant or adult brain and was present only in blood cells of pregnant rats and humans but not in nonpregnant controls. However, Y-P30 transcription could be induced in PBMCs of adult animals by a central nervous system lesion (i.e., optic nerve crush), which points to a potential role of the factor not only in neuronal development but also in neuroinflammation after white matter injury."

https://openalex.org/W2000979549,"We recently identified three AKAP12 isoforms that are differentially regulated by distinct promoters. During a screen to identify molecular determinants distinguishing the activities of these promoters, we found a potential binding site for the serum response factor (SRF) in the promoter of the ubiquitously expressed AKAP12α isoform. SRF is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that governs disparate programs of gene expression linked to cellular growth and differentiation. Using a combination of reporter assays and RNA interference, we demonstrate that SRF is required for AKAP12α expression. SRF regulates the activity of the AKAP12α promoter through two conserved CArG boxes that bind SRF with different affinities. Unlike other SRF-dependent genes, AKAP12α is not regulated by growth or differentiation stimuli. Molecular analysis of the AKAP12α SRF-binding sites, or CArG boxes, indicates that sequences flanking these sites are the determinants of sensitivity to SRF-activating signals. Specifically, the AKAP12α CArG boxes are shielded from growth stimulation by the absence of a binding site for Ets transcription factors. Similarly, sensitivity to the differentiation-associated co-factor, myocardin, was also determined by responsive flanking sequence; however, unlike growth stimuli, sensitivity to myocardin was found to also be dependent on a consensus CArG box.

The importance of SRF-dependent gene expression is underscored by the essential role of SRF in normal eukaryotic homeostasis. For example, mutation of the yeast ortholog of SRF, MCM1, elicits perturbations in mating and sporulation (3Elble R. Tye B-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More recently, tissue-restricted inactivation of SRF resulted in severe defects in cardiovascular development (10Parlakian A. Tuil D. Hamard G. Tavernier G. Hentzen D. Concordet J-P. Paulin D. Li Z.

Collectively, molecular inactivation studies of SRF have revealed a critical role for this transcription factor in cellular differentiation, migration, and cytoarchitecture. Insight into how SRF regulates distinct gene sets linked to such disparate biological processes first emerged when it was discovered that SRF interacts with other transcription factors that bind to sites flanking the CArG box. For example, SRF regulation of the c-fos proto-oncogene was found to be dependent upon interaction with Ets family members, such as ELK-1 and SAP-1, which bind to cognate sites flanking the CArG box (12Dalton S.

Importantly, whether a target gene is responsive to one SRF complex over another will depend on both the CArG sequence itself as well as flanking sequences immediately adjacent to CArG (25Chang P.S.

We recently characterized the regulatory regions controlling three isoforms of AKAP12 (A kinase anchoring protein 12) (28Streb J.W. Kitchen C.M. Gelman I.H. Miano J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56014-56023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). During further sequence analysis, we identified two evolutionarily conserved CArG boxes in the 5′ promoter of the ubiquitously expressed α isoform of AKAP12. Because AKAP12 has been implicated in both growth and cytoskeletal controls (29Gelman I.H. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1782-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to characterize the role of SRF in regulating AKAP12α as a means to further understand the function of this AKAP12 isoform. In the present study, we demonstrate that the AKAP12α promoter is responsive to SRF. Moreover, AKAP12α expression is highly dependent on SRF, because RNA interference knockdown of SRF severely attenuates endogenous AKAP12α expression. SRF binds with varying affinity to two CArG boxes in the AKAP12α promoter, and both CArGs are required for full regulation by SRF. Unexpectedly, AKAP12α is refractory to growth- (serum) and differentiation-inducing (MYOCD) stimuli, suggesting the existence of a unique class of SRF target genes. Extensive analysis of each AKAP12α CArG element and its immediate flanking sequences reveals an inherent shielding of the AKAP12α promoter from both growth factor- and muscle/cytoskeletal-inducing cues. Collectively, our data demonstrate that AKAP12α belongs to a novel class of ubiquitously expressed SRF target genes whose basal expression is regulated by SRF. Furthermore, we provide new insight into the role of flanking sequences in determining sensitivity to SRF-MYOCD activity. Cell Culture—NIH-3T3 (3T3) and A7r5 smooth muscle cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B. Rat-2 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. All of the cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Plasmids—The AKAP12α promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were as recently described (28Streb J.W. Kitchen C.M. Gelman I.H. Miano J.M. J. Biol.

Mutation of the two AKAP12α CArG boxes was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's directions, the –1034 AKAP12α luciferase reporter, and the following primers: CArG1mutFr, 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTGTCTTTAAGGAGTTTGCCACGAGCGCGTCCC; CArG1mutRv, 5′-GGGACGCGCTCGTGGCAAACTCCTTAAAGACAAAAAAAAAAAAAA; CArG2mutFr, 5′-CCCTGCCACGTGAGCCGCGTCAATATGGCCAGGCTCAGG; and CArG2mutRv, 5′-CCTGAGCCTGGCCATATTGACGCGGCTCACGTGGCAGGG.

All of the mutants were sequenced to confirm fidelity and then subcloned into a new pGL3-Basic (Promega) backbone. For examination of the role of sequence flanking the CArG boxes, a minimal tk reporter was created by amplifying the tk promoter of tk-RL (Promega) with the following restriction enzyme-clamped primers: tkFrBglII, 5′-GATAAGATCTCCCCGCCCAGCGTCTTG, and tkRvHindIII, 5′-GATAAAGCTTTTAAGCGGGTCGCTGC. The amplified product was digested with BglII and HindIII, gel-purified, and then ligated into BglII-HindIII cut pGL3-Basic to create the tk-luciferase plasmid.

An SRE-Luc reporter was a generous gift from Ravi Misra (Medical College of Wisconsin). Constitutively active MEK5 (CA-MEK5) in pCDNA3.1 was kindly provided by Dr. Bradford Berk (University of Rochester). The mouse MYOCD cDNA in pCDNA3.1 was generously provided by Dr. Eric Olsen (University of Texas Southwestern). Expression plasmids encoding the MYOCD-related transcription factors, MRTF-A and MRTF-B, were kindly provided by Dr. Ron Prywes (Columbia University). Reporter Transfections—3T3 cells were seeded in 24-well plates, allowed to adhere overnight, and then transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Control, constitutively active, or co-factor encoding plasmids were added in amounts equal to the reporters (400 ng/well). The Renilla luciferase reporter pRL-TK (Promega) was co-transfected at 50 ng/well to normalize for transfection efficiency between conditions. All of the constructs were transfected in triplicate and assayed 48 h post-transfection as described previously (31Miano J.M. Olson E.N. J. Biol.

In some experiments, we stimulated transfected cells with jasplakinolide (Molecular Probes) as indicated. The data presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. The error bars represent S.E. Adenoviral Construction, Titering, and Transduction—To generate the short hairpin (sh) GFP and shSRF RNA interference vectors, the following oligonucleotides were annealed and then ligated into BseRI-BamHI cut pSHAG (a generous gift of Dr. Greg Hannon, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): shGFPA, 5′-TTGTACTCCAGCTTGTGCCCCAGGATGTGAAGCTTGACATCCTGGGGCGCAGGCTGGAGTGCAACTATTTTTT and shGFPB, 5′-GATCAAAAAATAGTTGCACTCCAGCCTGCGCCCCAGGATGTCAAGCTTCACATCCTGGGGCACAAGCTGGAGTACAACG; shSRFA, 5′-ACGGGCATCATGAAGAAGTTCAAGAGACTTCTTCATGATGCCCGTCTTTTTT; and shSRFB, 5′-GATCAAAAAAGACGGGCATCATGAAGAAGTCTCTTGAACTTCTTCATGATGCCCGTCG. The shGFP and shSRF vectors were then recombined with pAd/plDEST (Invitrogen) using LR clonase (Invitrogen) to create the adenoviral constructs. Following linearization with PacI (New England Biolabs), each construct was transfected separately into HEK-293A cells with Lipofectamine 2000. Viral production was allowed to proceed until cell lysis was judged greater than 95% complete, at which time the supernatant was collected. A crude viral lysate was prepared from this supernatant by three freeze-thaw cycles. Each crude lyaste was tested for its ability to silence its corresponding target (data not shown) and then amplified by reinfecting HEK-293A cells. After complete cell lysis, the adenovirus was purified from the supernatant using the AdenoMini kit from Virapur as per the manufacturer's directions. Viral titers, as measured in infectious units, were determined using the Adeno-X Rapid Titer kit (BD Clontech) as per the manufacturer's directions. Large scale adenoviral preparations were kindly provided through the National Institutes of Health-funded Vector Core Facility at the University of Pittsburgh. For adenoviral transductions, A7r5 cells were seeded in 100 mm plates and allowed to adhere overnight. The cells from one plate were detached by trypsinization and counted with a hemocytometer to determine the number of cells seeded. The cells were transduced with a viral load of 30 infectious units/cell, a viral load we determined had an optimal transduction/cell viability ratio (data not shown). Transductions were performed in a small volume of DMEM containing 2% FBS. For the first hour, transduced plates were gently rocked every 15 min to evenly distribute the virus. The volume of media on each plate was then increased, and the plates were incubated overnight. The following day, the cells were washed, refed complete media, and incubated until harvesting at the indicated times. RNA Isolation, Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR, and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's directions. For the serum stimulation time course, RNA was isolated from Rat-2 cells made quiescent for 24 h with 0.25% FBS-containing DMEM and then stimulated for the indicated times with 10% FBS-containing DMEM. Total RNA was quantitated using a spectrophotometer. For cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of total RNA from each condition was reverse transcribed using the Transcriptor reverse transcription kit (Roche Applied Science) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Semi-quantitative PCR was then performed using the cDNA as template and one of the following primer pairs: AKAP12αFr, 5′-gatatctagaAGCGAGCTGGTGCTCAGTG; AKAP12αRv, 5′-gatactcgagCATGGACATCTCCTTGTTCAGC; TUBA1Fr, 5′-gatatctagaTGCCAATAACTATGCCCGTG; or TUBA1Rv, 5′-gatactcgagAAACCAAGAAGCCCTGGAGAC. The linear amplification range of each primer set was determined by performing multiple PCRs with the number of cycles ranging from 19 to 35. For Northern blotting, 10 μg of total RNA was separated on a denaturing 1.2% agarose gel and then capillary-transferred overnight to a charged membrane (ZetaProbeGT; Bio-Rad). Following transfer, RNA was UV cross-linked to the membrane. The membrane was then prehybridized in RapidHybe solution (Amersham Biosciences). Radiolabeled probes for AKAP12α, AKAP12β, and 18 S rRNA were prepared using the Ladderman labeling kit (Panvera). Probes were hybridized to the membranes with rotation for 1 h. The hybridization buffer was then discarded, and the membrane was washed in a low stringency buffer to remove excess probe. Following a brief rinse in a high stringency wash buffer, the membrane was sealed with Saran wrap and then exposed to film to visualize probe hybridization. Gel Shift—To examine SRF binding to the two AKAP12α CArG boxes, the following oligonucleotide pairs (CArG element underlined) were annealed together: CArG1Fr, 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTCTTTTAAGGAGTTTGCCACGAGCGCGTCCC; and CArG1Rv, 5′-GGGACGCGCTCGTGGCAAACTCCTTAAAAGAAAAAAAAAAAA; CArG1mutFr (see above); CArG1mutRv (see above); CArG2Fr, 5′-CCCTGCCACGTGAGCCGCCCTAATATGGCCAGGCTCAGG; CArG2Rv, 5′-CCTGAGCCTGGCCATATTAGGGCGGCTCACGTGGCAGGG; CArG2mutFr (see above); and CArG2mutRv (see above). The wild-type AKAP12α CArG oligonucleotides were radio end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The gel shifts were then performed essentially as described previously (30Miano J.M. Carlson M.J. Spencer J.A. Misra R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9814-9822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). AKAP12α Is a New SRF Target Gene—The AKAP12 gene encodes three transcriptionally distinct isoforms, designated α, β, and γ, to reflect both the timeline of their discovery and their position within the AKAP12 locus (28Streb J.W. Kitchen C.M. Gelman I.H. Miano J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56014-56023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These three isoforms have distinct subcellular distribution and expression profiles, with the latter property presumably caused by differences within the regulatory regions or promoters of the isoforms. Because identifying factors that regulate AKAP12 expression could provide a foundational step toward identifying unique roles for each isoform, we performed an in-depth survey of potential transcription factor-binding sites within the promoters of the major AKAP12 isoforms, AKAP12α and AKAP12β. Consistent with our original foundational study of AKAP12 localization, we identified several GC box and E box elements in both the α and β promoters. Because we previously demonstrated that similar transcriptional factors, such as USF-1, can bind to elements found in both promoters (28Streb J.W. Kitchen C.M. Gelman I.H. Miano J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56014-56023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we chose to focus our search on sites found in only one of the promoters. One of the sites identified in this fashion was a CArG box, located at –502 from the start site of AKAP12α transcription (GenBank™ accession number AY695059), that could potentially serve as a binding site for SRF. Both SRF and AKAP12α are ubiquitously expressed, suggesting that SRF may be involved in AKAP12α regulation. Because no CArG boxes were found in the AKAP12β promoter, we chose to analyze this site further in the hope of gaining new insight in the regulation of AKAP12α. To determine whether AKAP12α is regulated by SRF, we tested the ability of a constitutively active form of SRF, SRF-VP16, to regulate activity of a large AKAP12α promoter construct encompassing this consensus CArG element. SRF-VP16 activates both a control serum response element (SRE) reporter derived from the c-fos promoter and the AKAPα promoter (Fig. 1A) but has no affect on a control construct lacking a CArG box (data not shown). To confirm that SRF regulates AKAP12α in its native context, we generated an adenovirus, named shSRF, expressing a double-stranded hairpin targeted against SRF under the control of the U6 promoter, to knock down endogenous SRF expression. Transduction of A7r5 smooth muscle cells with shSRF reduces SRF protein levels by over 90% (data not shown). In contrast, a similarly constructed adenovirus, shGFP, expressing a hairpin targeting enhanced green fluorescent protein, does not affect SRF expression (data not shown). 2A detailed analysis of the effects of these viruses on cell function and SRF-dependent gene regulation will be reported separately (J. W. Streb and J. M. Miano, manuscript in preparation). Knockdown of SRF expression plateaus at 3 days post-transduction and persists for at least 4 more days (data not shown). We analyzed the expression of AKAP12α by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR at two points after SRF expression is reduced. Knockdown of SRF results in a substantial reduction of AKAP12α expression at both times tested (Fig. 1B). This effect is specific, because expression of the SRF-independent tubulin gene, TUBA1, was not changed (Fig. 1B). Together with the promoter analysis, these data indicate that SRF is a key regulator of AKAP12α expression, thus making it a new SRF target gene. A Second Nonconsensus CArG Box in the AKAP12α Promoter—To determine whether SRF regulates AKAP12α through the –502 CArG box, we used several promoter deletion constructs to identify the SRF-responsive region of the AKAP12α promoter. Consistent with our above data, SRF-VP16 increases activity of both a control SRE reporter and a large AKAP12α promoter construct (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, however, a construct lacking the region between nucleotides –1034 and –174 that contains the consensus CArG box is only slightly less activated by SRF-VP16 (Fig. 2A). Further deletion of the AKAP12α promoter indicates that the region from nucleotides –71 to –31 is the main SRF-responsive region, because deletion of this region abolished induction by SRF-VP16 (see –30 LUC in Fig. 2A). Although our initial scan of the AKAP12α promoter identified only one consensus CArG box, our deletion analysis indicates that a second SRF-responsive site exists in the AKAP12α promoter. When we re-examined the sequence of the SRF-responsive region spanning nucleotides –71 to –31, we identified a CArG-like motif at –32 that differs from the consensus at the 5′ nucleotide position (Fig. 2B). Based on their position relative to the transcriptional start site, we refer hereafter to the nonconsensus CArG as CArG1 and the consensus CArG as CArG2. The newly identified CArG1 is flanked at the 5′ end by a polythymidin"

Formation of the extraembryonic endoderm, which later contributes to the yolk sac, appears to be a prerequisite for subsequent differentiation of the inner cell mass. While embryonic stem cells can be induced to differentiate into extraembryonic endoderm cells in vitro, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. We used a promoter trap approach to search for genes that are expressed in embryonic stem cells and are highly up-regulated during differentiation to the extraembryonic endoderm fate. We showed that fibronectin fits this expression profile. Moreover we identified an enhancer in the 12th intron of the fibronectin locus that recapitulated the endogenous pattern of fibronectin expression. This enhancer carries Sox protein-binding sequences, and our analysis demonstrated that Sox7 and Sox17, which are highly expressed in the extraembryonic endoderm, were involved in enhancer activity.

Understanding cell fate commitment and differentiation at the molecular level is a major area of interest in the field of developmental biology. The first overt differentiation step in mouse development occurs at about 3.5 days postcoitum when the blastomeres segregate into two distinct cell lineages to form the blastocyst stage embryo (1Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). The trophectoderm, which contributes exclusively to extraembryonic tissues, forms the outer population of cells, while the inner cell mass (ICM), 1The abbreviations used are: ICM, inner cell mass; ES, embryonic stem; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; tk, thymidine kinase; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; EF-1, elongation factor 1; HMG, high mobility group; E14, embryonic day 14; EC, embryonic carcinoma; Feec, fibronectin enhancer involved in extraembryonic endoderm cells; PE, parietal endoderm; VE, visceral endoderm; RA, retinoic acid. which is competent to differentiate into all embryonic tissue types, comprises the inner population of cells. Although extraembryonic tissues such as the placenta, amnion, and yolk sac are not part of the fetus proper, these tissues play pivotal roles in development, including nourishment and protection of the fetus within the uterus as well as embryonic axis formation by extraembryonic endoderm cells at early stages. While substantial portions of extraembryonic tissues are derived from the trophectoderm, the ICM also contributes significantly to extraembryonic tissues. For example, the extraembryonic or primitive endoderm, which gives rise to portions of the yolk sac, is derived from the ICM. This differentiation step can be mimicked in vitro by culturing ICM-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells in the absence of a cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (1Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this differentiation remain unknown at present. To investigate the molecular basis of extraembryonic endoderm differentiation, we generated a promoter-trapped mouse ES clone in which expression of the pGTIRESβgeopA reporter gene (4Mountford P.

However, since the trophectoderm also produces fibronectin, it is unclear which cell type is the major source of fibronectin in Reichert's membrane. Our data clearly demonstrated that it is the extraembryonic endoderm, and not the trophectoderm, that represents the major source of fibronectin production. Moreover we identified a regulatory enhancer in intron 12 of the fibronectin gene that, when linked to a reporter gene, recapitulated endogenous expression during differentiation of ES cells to extraembryonic endoderm. We also showed that Sox7 and Sox17, whose expression is restricted to the extraembryonic endoderm in mouse early embryos (9Kanai-Azuma M. Kanai Y. Gad J.M. Tajima Y. Taya C. Kurohmatsu M. Sanai Y.

HpaII-digested DNA was inserted into the ClaI site of the vector. To construct the Feec1-tk-β-geo reporter gene, the splice acceptor domain of the Engrailed gene and the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) sequence were removed from pGTIRESβgeopA reporter plasmid (4Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nicholis J. Li M. Dani C. Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and a fibronectin enhancer involved in extraembryonic endoderm cells (Feec) 1 DNA fragment obtained by PCR was subcloned as a SalI/BamHI fragment 5′ of the tk promoter. To generate tk-puro-Venus reporter constructs bearing wild type and deletion mutants of Feec1, the SalI/BamHI PCR products shown in Fig. 5B were individually subcloned into the puro-Venus reporter plasmid together with the tk promoter. For construction of puro-Venus reporter genes bearing wild type, nucleotide substitution mutants of Feec1 shown in Fig. 7A,or canonical B1 repetitive sequence, we used our previously established method (15Okuda A. Imagawa M. Maeda Y. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16919-16926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using overlapping oligonucleotides that carry a portion (from 20 to 30 nucleotides) of the target DNA regions. For nucleotide substitution mutants, underlined nucleotides in Fig. 7A were converted to non-complementary ones, i.e. G, A, T, and C were changed to T, C, G, and A, respectively. Construction of the EF-1-puro-Venus reporter plasmid was described previously (13Miyagi S. Saito T. Mizutani K. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Iwama A. Nakauchi H. Masui S. Niwa H. Nishimoto M. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4207-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For constructing Sox expression vectors, the entire coding regions of Sox2, Sox7, and Sox17 were recovered as Asp718/BamHI fragments by PCR in which Asp718 sites were at the initiating ATG codons. These were subcloned into an expression vector bearing a FLAG tag sequence, which was generated by introducing specific oligonucleotides into the pHβApr-1 expression vector (16Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.-Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). To construct the Sox17 HMG-Engrailed expression vector, the aminoterminal portion of Sox17 (amino acids 1–164) bearing the HMG domain (17Kanai Y. Kanai-Azuma M. Noce T. Saido T.C. Shiroishi T.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1427-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR and subcloned together into the pHβApr-1 expression vector. To construct the Feec1-tk-Luc reporter plasmid, the Feec1 regulatory region was amplified by PCR as an Asp718/XhoI fragment and was subcloned into the tk-Luc reporter plasmid.Fig. 7Identification of the core regulatory sequence of the Feec1 enhancer.A, the SRY element, as delineated by the analysis shown in Fig. 5B, plays a crucial role in Feec1 activity. Putative transcription factor binding sites are underlined. Mutations were generated at these sites as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and enhancer activity indexes of the wild-type and Feec1 mutants were calculated as in Fig. 5. B, canonical B1 repetitive elements do not function as an enhancer element in the extraembryonic endoderm. The tk-puro-Venus reporter plasmid bearing the Feec1 or B1 repetitive element or no canonical regulatory region was individually introduced into differentiated ZHTc6 cells, and puromycin-resistant colonies were obtained. Enhancer activity indexes of the Feec1 and B1 element were calculated as in Fig. 5. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Culture and Transfection of ES Cells and Other Cells—E14 ES cells were cultured as described previously (19Nishimoto M. Fukushima A. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5453-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The pGTIRESβgeopA reporter plasmid was introduced into ES cells by electroporation according to the method described by Thomas and Capecchi (20Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). After selection with G418, the drug-resistant clones were picked and expanded. These cells were stained for LacZ to examine the level and pattern of reporter gene expression. ZHBTc4 and ZHTc6 ES cells were cultured as described by Niwa et al. (3Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar) and were differentiated into trophectoderm and extraembryonic endoderm, respectively. F9 embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells and COS cells were cultured as described previously (21Tomioka M. Nishimoto M. Miyagi S. Katayanagi T. Fukui N. Niwa H. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3202-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Introduction of plasmid DNAs into ZHBTc4, ZHTc6, and F9 cells was done by lipofection using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), while the conventional calcium phosphate method was used to introduce DNA into COS cells. In Vitro Differentiation of ES Cells and F9 EC Cells—E14 ES cells were induced to differentiate in vitro essentially as described by Robertson (2Robertson E.J. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1987: 71-122Google Scholar). In brief, embryoid bodies were formed on bacteria grade plates in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor for 4 days. These cells were further cultured to form cystic embryoid bodies or replated on tissue culture grade plates. F9 EC cells were induced to differentiate with 0.5 μm all-trans-retinoic acid alone or together with 1 mm dibutyryl cAMP as described by Hogan et al. (1Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Determination of the Integration Site of pGTIRESβgeopA Reporter Gene—Genomic DNA was prepared from ES cell clone 183, which has extraembryonic endoderm-specific reporter gene expression (see text for details). The DNA was cut with NcoI, which is present in the reporter gene (4Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nicholis J. Li M. Dani C. Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and BspHI, which is present in the chromosomal integration site of the reporter gene by Southern blot analysis (data not shown, see Fig. 3A for details). The genomic DNA was then circularized with T4 DNA ligase and used as template for PCR to identify the junction between the reporter gene and chromosomal DNA. The primers used for PCR were as follows: 5′-GATGATAAGCTTGCCACAACCATG-3′ and 5′-ACCCGCACGCCATACAGTCCTCTT-3′. The PCR product was directly used for sequencing analysis. RNA Preparation and RNase Mapping Analysis—RNA was prepared from ZHBTc4 and ZHTc6 ES cells using the RNeasy midikit from Qiagen. RNA was also prepared from undifferentiated as well as differentiated F9 cells and was used to examine gene expression levels by RNase protection as described previously (19Nishimoto M. Fukushima A. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5453-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Probes to the following sequences were used: fibronectin, nucleotides 4081–4291; hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β, nucleotides 377–604; Rex-1, nucleotides 75–352; Mash2, nucleotides 190–408; and β-actin, nucleotides 903–1023. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—RNA was prepared as above from wild-type E14 ES cells and ES cell clone 183 (see text for details) and used to produce first strand complementary DNA by Powerscript reverse transcriptase from BD Biosciences. The cDNA was used for PCR analysis to detect the presence of wild-type fibronectin RNA and fibronectin fused to IRES-β-geo RNA derived from pGTIRESβgeopA. The following primers were used: for wild-type fibronectin RNA: Primer A, 5′-CTCCAGGCGTGGAATACACTTACACCATCC-3′; and Primer B, 5′-GATCAGCATGGACCACTTCTTCCAGAGAGG-3′; for fibronectin RNA fused to IRES-β-geo RNA: Primer C, 5′-AACCCTGACACTGGAGTGCTTACTGTCTCC-3′; and Primer D, 5′-TTCTCTAGAGTCCAGATCTTCCGGGTACCG-3′. Reporter Assay with Puro-Venus Vector—The puro-Venus reporter gene encodes a fusion protein of puromycin-detoxifying enzyme and Venus fluorescent protein (for details see Ref. 13Miyagi S. Saito T. Mizutani K. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Iwama A. Nakauchi H. Masui S. Niwa H. Nishimoto M. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4207-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The reporter can be used for both transient and stable transfection assays with puromycin detoxifying activity used for the stable transformant analysis as shown in Figs. 5, 6B, and 7, while transient transfection analysis can be done by monitoring the level of Venus fluorescence protein as shown in Fig. 6D. Identification of a Fibronectin Regulatory Region That Functions in the Extraembryonic Endoderm—Puro-Venus reporter plasmid libraries were constructed by inserting a small piece of genomic DNA from the fibronectin locus. These libraries were then introduced by lipofection into ZHTc6 cells that had been differentiated into extraembryonic endoderm cells, and puromycin-resistant colonies were obtained. After expansion, genomic DNA was recovered from these cells, and PCR was performed with the reverse primer from the Bluescript II KS+ vector sequence and a primer recognizing a portion of the tk promoter sequence. PCR products derived from HpaII and Sau3AI libraries were digested with SalI/BamHI and SalI/Sau3AI, respectively, and subcloned into the tk-puro-Venus reporter gene. The constructed plasmids were again transfected into the differentiated ZHTc6 cells as above to examine the enhancer activities of the subcloned PCR fragments. Luciferase Reporter Assay—COS cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (21Tomioka M. Nishimoto M. Miyagi S. Katayanagi T. Fukui N. Niwa H. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3202-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) with 2 μg of the Feec1-tk-Luc reporter plasmid and the indicated amounts of expression vectors. The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 12 μg with pUC18. At 48 h post-transfection, the transcription level was determined by the dual luciferase method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Gel Shift Assay—The Sox7 or Sox17 expression vector or empty vector was introduced into COS cells by the calcium phosphate method as described above. Preparation of whole cell extracts and subsequent gel shift analysis were done as described previously (21Tomioka M. Nishimoto M. Miyagi S. Katayanagi T. Fukui N. Niwa H. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3202-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The sequences used for the analysis were as follows: wild type, 5′-TGTCGTTCCAGGACAGCCAGGGCTATAACAAAGGAACCCTGTCTCGAAACCACCCCCAAA-3′; mutant, 5′-TGTCGTTCCAGGACAGCCAGGGCTATCCACCCTGAACCCTGTCTCGAAACCACCCCCAAA-3′. The underlined portion and bold portion indicate the wild-type and mutagenized Sox-binding sequence, respectively. The probe sequences represent part of the Feec1 regulatory sequence and contain two potential transcription factor binding sites (γ and ϵ) in addition to the Sox binding site (δ). However, the γ and ϵ sites were mutagenized to simplify the analysis. Identification of a Gene Whose Expression Level Is Highly Up-regulated during Differentiation of ES Cells into Extraembryonic Endoderm Cells—To elucidate the molecular mechanism of extraembryonic endoderm differentiation from ES cells, we searched for genes whose expression is highly up-regulated during this process. To this end, we randomly integrated the pGTIRESβgeopA reporter gene encoding a fusion protein of β-galactosidase and neomycin-detoxifying enzyme (4Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nicholis J. Li M. Dani C. Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) into the genome of ES cells by electroporation. Although cells were cultured in conditions to maintain stem cell state, a small subpopulation of ES cells adopted extraembryonic endodermal fate due to spontaneous differentiation, particularly at the periphery of colonies. Since much higher levels of gene expression are required to turn on LacZ+ than to confer G418 resistance, we picked ES cell clones that were mostly LacZ-negative but had expression at the periphery of colonies. Of 400 independent G418-resistant clones, one clone (clone 183) showed the expected expression profile (Fig. 1A) in marked contrast to the expression profile of a clone in which the reporter gene integrated into Rex-1 (Fig. 1B), which is expressed in pluripotent ES cells (22Ben-Shushan E. Thompson J.R. Gudas L.J. Bergmasn Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1866-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). LacZ Reporter Gene Expression Profile in ES Cell Clone 183 during Differentiation into Extraembryonic Endoderm—Next cells from clone 183 were allowed to differentiate into embryoid bodies (2Robertson E.J. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1987: 71-122Google Scholar) and stained for β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, a simple embryoid body (day 4) shows LacZ expression in the outer extraembryonic endoderm layer but not in the inner, pluripotent ectodermal cells. In cystic embryoid bodies (day 8) LacZ staining was intensified (Fig. 2C), and when replated onto a tissue culture surface, strong LacZ staining pattern was observed in cells derived from the outer layer but not in undifferentiated, inner layer cells (Fig. 2D). The pGTIRESβgeopA Reporter Gene Integrated into the Fibronectin Locus in ES Cell Clone 183—To determine the chromosomal integration site of the pGTIRESβgeopA reporter gene in ES cell clone 183, we first isolated genomic DNA from these cells. Southern blot analysis using a mouse Engrailed probe to detect the pGTIRESβgeopA reporter gene (4Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nicholis J. Li M. Dani C. Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) revealed that a BspHI site, which is at the initiating methionine codon of β-geo, was present at about 2.7 kb upstream of the NcoI site (see Fig. 3A for details). Therefore, we digested genomic ES cell DNA with BspHI/NcoI and circularized with T4 DNA ligase. Subsequently the integrated portion of genomic DNA was obtained by PCR (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). As depicted in Fig. 3A, sequencing analyses revealed that the reporter gene was integrated into the 23rd intron of the fibronectin gene. Moreover reverse transcription-PCR analyses confirmed that fibronectin mRNA and that from the reporter gene were fused in ES cell clone 183 but not in parental ES cells (Fig. 3B). Fibronectin Gene Expression Is Up-regulated during Differentiation of Pluripotent ES Cells to Extraembryonic Endodermal Cells—To determine whether the endogenous expression of fibronectin is extraembryonic endoderm-specific, we examined expression in two specialized ES cell lines (ZHTc6 and ZHBTc4) (3Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar) and their differentiated derivatives. ZHTc6 ES cells can be maintained in a pluripotent state in the presence of tetracycline, and withdrawal of tetracycline from the culture medium leads to extraembryonic endoderm differentiation. In contrast, ZHBTc4 ES cells are maintained in a pluripotent state in the absence of tetracycline, and addition of tetracycline results in dedifferentiation to trophectoderm fate. We prepared RNA from these cells cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline and performed RNase protection assays. As shown in Fig. 4 when cultured in the absence of tetracycline, fibronectin was indeed highly expressed in ZHTc6 cells, which adopt extraembryonic endoderm fate. We also examined the expression levels of Rex-1 (22Ben-Shushan E. Thompson J.R. Gudas L.J. Bergmasn Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1866-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β (23Farrington S.M. Belaoussoff M. Baron M.H. Mech. Dev. 1997; 62: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and Mash2 (24Tanaka M. Gertsenstein M. Rossant J. Nagy A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 190: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and confirmed that pluripotent/differentiated states of these ES cells are, as expected, regulated by tetracycline. Identification of an Enhancer Involved in Fibronectin Gene Expression in Extraembryonic Endodermal Cells—To identify the regulatory element responsible for extraembryonic endoderm expression of fibronectin, we first digested BAC DNA bearing the entire fibronectin gene as well as 5′ and 3′ flanking regions into small fragments using the 4-base cutter Sau3AI or HpaII. The digested DNA was inserted upstream of the tk promoter in the tk-puro-Venus reporter plasmid to generate plasmid libraries (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). These plasmid libraries were then introduced by lipofection into ZHTc6 cells, which had been cultured in the absence of tetracycline, and puromycin-resistant colonies were obtained. The BAC DNA was recovered by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from 84 independent puromycin-resistant colonies. These fragments were again individually inserted upstream of the tk promoter of the reporter plasmid and introduced into ZHTc6 cells, and puromycin-resistant colonies were obtained. In most cases, an equivalent number of puromycin-resistant colonies was obtained with BAC-transfected and control tk-puro-Venus reporter plasmid-transfected cells, indicating that the original puromycin resistance observed from the primary screen was not due to the inserted BAC DNA but was instead dependent on the site of reporter gene integration. However, in one case, significantly more resistant colonies were obtained (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the BAC DNA inserted in the reporter plasmid was involved in producing the resistant colonies. Sequencing analysis revealed that the BAC DNA carries a portion of intron 12 (1568 bp) of the fibronectin gene, and preliminary characterization demonstrated that this DNA fragment exerted its activity rather specifically in extraembryonic ectodermal cells (data not shown, but see below for details). We next delineated the regulatory region using a series of deletion mutants shown in Fig. 5B. We characterized their enhancer activities by counting the number of puromycin-resistant stable colonies, and these analyses allowed us to narrow down the regulatory region to 144 bp (the sequence is shown in Fig. 7A), and we termed this regulatory region Feec1. The Feec1 Enhancer Drives Expression Specifically in Extraembryonic Endoderm Cells—Next we examined whether the Feec1 enhancer can drive expression specifically in extraembryonic endoderm cells. We constructed a tk-β-geo reporter plasmid carrying the Feec1 enhancer and introduced it into ES cells by electroporation along with pSV2Neo since Feec1 alone might not be strong enough to produce G418-resistant colonies when the ES cells are in the pluripotent state. We obtained four independent ES cell clones in which both Feec1-tk-β-geo and the pSV2Neo reporter gene integrated into the genome. These clones were then allowed to differentiate, and reporter gene expression was examined at day 8 following replating on tissue culture dishes. We found that in all cases, LacZ reporter expression was detected in cells derived from outer layer cells but not in pluripotential inner cells (two representative examples are shown in Fig. 6A), although the signal was not as strong as that shown in Fig. 2D. Next we examined the activity of the Feec1 regulatory region in ZHTc6 and ZHBTc4 cells using the Feec1-puro-Venus reporter plasmid and found that, as expected, the Feec1 enhancer showed strong activity in ZHTc6 cells that had differentiated into endoderm-like cells (Fig. 6B). However, weaker activity was observed for Feec1 in ZHBTc4 ES cells that were maintained in pluripotent state. To obtain an independent line of evidence that the Feec1 functions as an extraembryonic endoderm-specific enhancer, we performed similar experiments using F9 EC cells. While extraembryonic endoderm cells are first comprised of primitive endoderm upon segregation from the embryonic ICM cells, the primitive endoderm differentiates further into parietal endoderm (PE) and"
