https://openalex.org/W2094620274,"The fouling marine mussel Mytilus edulis attaches itself to various substrates by spinning byssal threads, the adhesive discs of which are rich in the amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa). An acid-soluble protein was extracted and purified from the phenol gland located in the byssus-secreting foot of the animal. This protein is highly basic and contains large amounts of lysine, dopa, and 3- and 4-hydroxyproline. The composition of this protein and its sticky tendencies in vitro strongly suggest that it contributes to byssal adhesion."

Ninety-six percent of the homosporous Pteridophyta show a gametic chromosome number greater than 27, whereas 90 percent of the heterosporous ones possess a gametic chromosome number less than 28. Ultrafrequent establishment of poly- ploidy in the homosporous Pteridophy- ta appears to be necessary to create and maintain genetic variation in the face of the homozygotizing effects of habitual self-fertilization in the monoe- cious gametophytes of these plants."

Their structures are highly disordered, not well known, and controversial. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals that terrestrial todorokites consist of tunnel structures of previously unreported dimensions and that these tunnel structures are intergrown coherently on a unit cell scale. Many types and degrees of disorder are evident in the high-resolution images. These newly discovered structures indicate a need for a revised nomenclature of tunnel manganese oxides, and such a system is suggested."

Eighty percent of the autoradiographic grains were located over nerve endings and unmyelinated axons. Large, dense synaptic vesicles were present in most of the endings and axons with activity. Grains were rarely seen over myelinated axons, glia, or blood vessels."

However, we have identified glands in the tongue of Crocodylus porosus which exude a concentrated secretion of sodium chloride. The glands are similar in ultrastructure to other reptilian salt glands and undoubtedly play a major role in electrolyte regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2161360737,"With the scarcity of factual data and the difficulty of applying crucial tests, many of the properties of the Martian surface remain a mystery; the planet may become a source of great surprises in the future. In the following, the conclusions are enumerated more or less in the order of their reliability, the more certain ones first, conjectures or ambiguous interpretations coming last. Even if they prove to be wrong, they may serve as a stimulus for further investigation. Impact craters on Mars, from collisions with nearby asteroids and other stray bodies, were predicted 16 years ago (5-7) and are now verified by the Mariner IV pictures. The kink in the frequency curve of Martian crater diameters indicates that those larger than 20 kilometers could have survived aeolian erosion since the ""beginning."" They indicate an erosion rate 30 times slower than that in terrestrial deserts and 70 times faster than micrometeorite erosion on the moon. The observed number, per unit area, of Martian craters larger than 20 kilometers exceeds 4 times that calculated from the statistical theory of interplanetary collisions with the present population of stray bodies and for a time interval of 4500 million years, even when allowance is made for the depletion of the Martian group of asteroids, which were more numerous in the past. This, and the low eroded rims of the Martian craters suggest that many of the craters have survived almost since the formation of the crust. Therefore, Mars could not have possessed a dense atmosphere for any length of time. If there was abundant water for the first 100 million years or so, before it escaped it could have occurred only in the solid state as ice and snow, with but traces of vapor in the atmosphere, on account of the low temperature caused by the high reflectivity of clouds and snow. For Martian life there is thus the dilemma: with water, it is too cold; without, too dry. The crater density on Mars, though twice that in lunar maria, is much smaller than the ""saturation density"" of lunar highlands. Many primeval craters, those from the last impacts which formed the planet, must have become erased, either by late impacts of preferentially surviving large asteroids or by a primeval atmosphere which rapidly escaped. The tenuous Martian atmosphere may have originated entirely from outgassing of surface rocks by asteroidal impacts, which also could have produced some molten lava. The role of genuine volcanism on Mars must have been insignificant, if any. The large amplitude in temperature indicates that the Martian upper soil, equally in the bright and the dark areas, is of a porous unconsolidated structure, with a thermal conductivity as low as that of atmospheric air. Limb darkening at full phase in green, yellow, and red light indicates absorption by atmospheric haze, aerosols, and dust. The loss of contrast in the blue and violet is caused by stronger absorptivity of the haze, which is almost as dark as soot, and not by a true decrease in contrast of the surface markings. Photometric measurementsin the blue reveal a residual contrast of 5 to 7 percent between the markings in 1958, invisible to the eye at a time when there was no ""blue clearing."" The surface brightness of the maria was surprisingly uniform in 1958 (late summer in the southern hemisphere), while the continentes showed considerable variation. In view of the spotty microstructure of the Martian surface as revealed by Mariner IV, and the lack of a sharp border between a mare and a continens, it seems that all the difference consists in the relative number of small dark and bright areas in the surface mosaic. If there is vegetation on Mars, it should be concentrated in the darkarea elements, measuring 10 to 100 kilometers. Vegetation is the best hypothesis to account for seasonal changes in the maria and for the persistence of these formations despite dust storms of global extent. Survival of vegetation in the extreme dryness of the Martian climate could depend on the low night-time temperature and deposition of hoarfrost, which could melt into droplets after sunrise, before evaporating. If not vegetation, it must be something thing specifically Martian; no other hypothesis hitherto proposed is able to account for the facts. However, the infrared bands which at one time were thought to be associated with the presence of organic matter, belong to heavy water in the terrestrial atmosphere. The conversion of a former bright area into a dark one in 1954, over some 1 million square kilometers, is the largest recorded change of this kind. Even on the vegetation hypothesis, it eludes satisfactory explanation. Relatively bright areas observed in the blue and violet in polar regions and elsewhere on the limb can be explained by a greater transparency of the atmosphere,its dust content being decreased by a downward (anticyclonic) current. The surface, of a greater reflecting power than the atmospheric smoke, then becomes visible. The sudden explosion-like occurrence of yellow or gray clouds, reducing atmospheric transparency and surface contrast, could be due to impacts of asteroids; in such a case, however, the number of unobservable small asteroids, down to 30 to 40 meters in diameter, should greatly exceed the number extrapolated from the larger members of the group. A ""meteoritic"" increment in numbers, instead of the asteroidal one, would be required. special observations with large Schmidt telescopes could settle this crucial question. The Martian ""oases,"" centers of ""canal"" systems, could be impact creters. The canals may be real formations, without sharp borders and 100 to 200 kilometers wide, due to a systematic alignment. of the dark surface elements. They may indicate cracks in the planet's crust, radiating from the point of impact."
https://openalex.org/W2071117234,"The Galilean satellites of Jupiter-Io (J1), Europa (J2), Ganymede (J3), and Callisto (J4)-are embedded in the intense ion and electron fluxes of the Jovian magnetosphere. The effect of these particles on the icy surfaces of the outer three satellites depends on the fluxes and the efficiency of the sputtering of water ice by such particles. Recent laboratory measurements provided data on the erosion of water ice by energetic particles and showed that it occurs much faster than would be expected from normal sputtering theory. The Voyager spacecraft encounters with Jupiter provided the first measurements of ion fluxes (energies greater, similar 30 kiloelectron volts) in the vicinity of the Galilean satellites. Using the laboratory sputtering data together with particle measurements from the Voyager 1 low-energy charged particle experiment, the effects of erosion on the surfaces of J2 to J4 are estimated. It is shown that the surface of Europa could be eroded by as much as 100 meters over an eon (10(9) years). Column densities of water vapor that could be produced around the three satellites from particle bombardment of their surfaces are also calculated, and the sources and losses of oxygen in the gravitationally bound gas produced by sputtering or sublimation are estimated."

By contrast, mycelial growth of various other fungi-Phycomycetes, Ascomycetes, and Deuteromycetes-was 50 percent inhibited only by concentrations of 32 ppm or higher. Two exceptions to this pattern of selective fungitoxicity were found:an isolate of Rhizoctonia solani was not as sensitive as other Basidiomycetes, and the deuteromycete Verticillium alboatrum was inhibited by lower concentrations than affected other fungi in this group. Spore germination of two Basidiomycetes, Uromyces phaseoli and Ustilago nuda, was inhibited 95 percent or more at 10 ppm."

https://openalex.org/W2098770606,"In July 1962 the US military detonated a 1.4-megaton hydrogen bomb 248 miles above Johnson Island in the Pacific, and for some time thereafter physicists puzzled over a resulting series of odd occurrences. Some 800 miles away in Hawaii, street lights had failed, burgular alarms had rung, and circuit breakers had popped open in power lines. Today, the mysterious agent is known as electromagnetic pulse (EMP). Physicists say a single nuclear detonation in near space would cover vast stretches of the earth with an EMP of 50,000 volts per meter. The first installment of this three-part series describes how EMP was discovered and why its potentially chaos-producing effects were overlooked for more than a decade. The second part will examine the ongoing debate in the Pentagon over how to cope with the EMP threat. The third will discuss questions EMP raises about about waging a limited nuclear war."

https://openalex.org/W2015316499,"When spin label is added to Chlamydomonas the organism is apparently unaffected, but the paramagnetic resonance signal of the spin label decreases. Irradiation with visible light greatly accelerates this decrease, which is partially reversible. If the cells are grown in the presence of the spin label and washed well, no spin label signal is detectable. However, such cells can no longer catalyze the destruction of added spin label in the light. This finding suggests that the molecule is bound to a specific site, which undergoes a change in conformation with illumination."

https://openalex.org/W1991199973,"There can be no immediate solution to the medical problems of the developing countries. Priorities are demanded, and it must be acknowledged that in allocation of medical priorities certain compromises are required. It can be hoped that the least detrimental compromises will be selected. Careful planning of health services and also of training programs for various medical personnel must not rely on what exists in developed countries, because those facilities and programs may be completely inappropriate to other situation. At the same time as inroads are made into the preventable conditions which now claim thousands of young lives, programs of birth control and improvement of agricultural methods must be emphasized. The reduced morbidity and mortality which results from immunization against childhood infectious diseases, smallpox, and tuberculosis must be borne in mind in overall planning for schools and general health services. Inexpensive and practical programs that could be managed by medical personnel who are not highly trained should be considered. As the benefits of technical development gradually reach the urbanizing population living under poor social and hygienic conditions, changes in the disease picture must be anticipated. Those involved with planning and training must understand various cultural influences so that the transition period can be made as painless as possible. Certain seemingly attractive Western procedures should be guarded against if they are not practical. For instance, a common tendency is to build large modern hospitals throughout the land with disregard for the fact that these hospitals cannot possibly be staffed, equipped, or maintained because of shortages of trained people and available funds (14). This has been called an ""edifice complex"" and is unfortunately found in many developing regions, stimulated often by ill-considered advice from overseas experts. At the same time as medical services are being improved, it is extremely important to document the improvements by means of carefully recorded statistics. Guidance in necessary methods for documentation should be sought early in the development of medical care (15). Obviously it is vital to determine what and where the major medical problems are so that programs will.be designed to attack them. Once the problems are sorted out, available resources can be allocated and preventive measures and health education can be aimed at specific aspects of public health. Many general statements have been made to describe the medical problems in the developing countries of the world. There is a need to particularize the problems and approach the specific manifestations of disease with knowledge of local conditions and resources. Accepted textbook solutions no longer apply in the field, and the ultimate solution may be along lines which are completely unique and nontraditional. To break the usual rules may be the only practical means to solve the problem at hand, and modified common sense must often replace modern technology. The practical variations on the general theme described here make medical work in developing countries interesting, exciting, and rewarding."

https://openalex.org/W2126979809,"Physics as a science has made incredible progress because of the delicate interplay between theory and experiment. Astonishing predictions based on theories devised to account for known phenomena have been confirmed by experiment. Experiments probing previously unexplored areas often reveal physical effects which are completely unanticipated by theoretical conjecture. The incorporation of the new effects into a theoretical framework then follows. This year Prof. Cronin and I are being honored for a purely experimental discovery, a discovery for which there were no precursive indications, either theoretical or experimental. It is a discovery for which after more than 16 years there is no satisfactory accounting. But showing as it does a lack of chargeconjugation parity symmetry and, correspondingly, a violation of time-reversal invariance, it touches on our understanding of nature at its deepest level. The discovery of failure of CP symmetry was made in the system of K mesons. This observation is especially interesting because it was the study of these same particles that led to the overthrow of parity conservation, the notion that interactions and their mirror-reflected counterparts must be equal. My own interest in K particles started in 1952-53 while I was at Columbia working with Jim Rainwater on µ--mesonic atoms. At that time the strange behavior of the particles newly discovered in cosmic rays"
