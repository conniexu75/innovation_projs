https://openalex.org/W943422790,"Several enzymatic reactions are known to utilize ribonucleoside triphosphates for incorporation of ribonucleotides into ribonucleic acid polymers. Two of these reactions have been well characterized. In one, cytidine 5’-phosphate and adenosine 5’-phosphate are added to the nucleoside terminal end of soluble RNA, forming an amino acid acceptor RNA terminated by the trinucleotide sequence, pCpCpA (14). The other is a deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent reaction, the product of which is an RNA with base ratios complementary to the primer DNA (5-S). In addition, other less well characterized reactions have been reported; in these, chiefly a single ribonucleoside monophosphate is incorporated, either as end addition or in endonucleotide linkage (9-14). It is the purpose of this communication to report the purification and characterization of an enzyme obtained from ribonucleoprotein particles of Escherichia COG that catalyzes an RNAdependent incorporation of ribonucleotides. The product of the reaction is primarily a polyriboadenylate polymer."

The enzyme is nonspecific and can form catechols from the following normally occurring and foreign phenols: p- and m-octopamine, p-hydroxyephedrine, phenol, stilbestrol, N- acetyl-p-aminophenol, estradiol and N- acetylserotonin."

https://openalex.org/W2076353211,"5'-Adenylic acid deaminase free from sodium and potassium ion is prepared from erythrocytes by a convenient method. Like adenosine triphosphatase and adenylic kinase from erythrocytes, the deaminase is activated by some monovalent cations, but unlike these enzymes it requires the presence of a monovalent cation. In all three instances the pattern of activation by ions is similar and suggests a common mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2015061851,"THE periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reaction—the term was introduced by McManus1,2—is one of the most widely used histochemical methods. In a recent review of “Periodate Oxidation Techniques” McManus2 states that the first publication, describing the demonstration of mucin and some other structures by the Schiff reagent after treatment with periodic acid, appeared in Nature in 19463. In 1948 Hotchkiss4 published his description of the PAS reaction, which had been applied already in 1947 by Gersh5 and by Catchpole6. Also in 1947 Marchese7 used the PAS reaction for the demonstration of glycogen, but independently Lillie8 used acidified periodate for the same purpose. Since other histochemical texts9–11 give essentially the same version of the development of our knowledge of the PAS reaction, we should like to direct attention to the work of A. L. Shabadash, whose publications on the PAS reaction apparently are not widely known outside the U.S.S.R."

https://openalex.org/W2069726762,Aliphatic aminocarboxylic acids inhibit at least two different antigen-antibody reactions. The degree of inhibition depends upon carbon chain length and the position of the amino group in relation to the carboxyl group.

https://openalex.org/W2043889202,"BY comparing the major non-casein proteins of the milk of the Indian buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) with those of cow's milk, it has been found1 that the single β-lactoglobulin component produced by the buffalo is very similar in properties to one (B) of the two genetically controlled variants (A and B)2,3 produced by the cow. Likewise, the single α-lactalbumin of buffalo milk resembles one (A) of the two variants (A and B) of this protein which occur in the milk of African4 and Indian humped (zebu) cattle5. (Non-zebu cows have only one α-lactalbumin which is like the B-variant of zebu milk.) Thus there are striking similarities in the corresponding non-casein milk proteins of buffalo and cattle, two species incapable of cross-breeding."

https://openalex.org/W1994883558,Reduction produced by vagal stimulation and application of acetylcholine in the duration of the membrane action potential in the toad is clearly demonstrated in the ventricular fiber as well as in the atrium. Vagal innervation of the ventricle is thus demonstrated. Vagal innervation of the ventricle is considered to be less extensive than vagal innervation of the atrium.

Furthermore, Dao2 has demonstrated the failure of 3-methylcholanthrene to induce mammary cancer in male rats irrespective of the dose given and despite the fact that its concentration was the same in the mammary tissues of both sexes. Since, in addition, Conney, Miller et al.3–6 have shown that these carcinogens rapidly induce the formation of hydroxylating and other enzymes in rat liver, it was decided to investigate the fate of orally administered polynuclear hydrocarbons on the metabolism of steroid œstrogens in hepatic tissue."
