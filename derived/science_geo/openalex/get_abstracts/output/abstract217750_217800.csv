This was shown by decreased formation of serotonin, tryptamine, and tyramine from the precursor amino acids. Reduction of amine biosynthesis is associated with lowering of blood pressure in hypertensive patients and a transient sedative effect."

It has now been demonstrated that many oil-soluble basic substances may act as synergists. For example, a primary amine (octadecylamine, ODA), a secondary amine (proline), and a tertiary amine (triisooctylamine, TOA) provided unexpectedly great protection against oxidation to oils containing added 6-ethoxy-2,2,4-trimethyl-1,2-di-hydroquinoline (EMQ, ‘Santoquin’), whereas in the absence of the last-named they conferred only slight or no protection at the same levels (Table 1)."

The inhibitory and spermicidal effects of visible light resemble a photodynamic action; the photosensitizer is an intrinsic component of the cell.

In this communication histochemical evidence is given of a strong enzyme activity in the rat's pineal gland capable of splitting L-leucyl-β-naphthylamide hydrochloride. Recent studies4,5 indicate that this activity is actually due to a group of peptidases, including ‘leucine aminopeptidase’."

https://openalex.org/W2032065124,"Protosiphon botryoides Klebs grows without evident zoosporogenesis in inorganic media in which strontium is substituted for calcium. Growth is 50 to 90 percent of that obtained with calcium; when sodium is substituted for calcium, there is no appreciable growth. Motility was observed at or above CaCl(2). 2H(2)O levels of 5 mg/lit., with or without strontium."

https://openalex.org/W2052990859,"THAT the hæm carboxyl groups might participate in reactions of hæmoproteins has received little attention, apparently because they were considered1,2 to be too far away to be affected by addition of ligands to the iron atom. It was suggested3 that the acid strength of hæm propionate side-chains might change, on the basis that substitution of R in RCH2CH2COOH has a significant effect on the pK value4 and that any alterations in the high state of resonance of the porphyrin ring system was likely to have the same effect as substitution of R. Further, since side-chain variation has a marked influence on the oxidation-reduction potential of the iron of hæmochromes2, it is, conversely, not unreasonable to expect that a change in electronic structure of the iron atom could effect the acid strength of the propionates."

https://openalex.org/W2039813842,Succinylcholine lowers the resting membrane potential taken with microelectrodes similarly in nerve-scarce and innervated portions of frog sartorius muscle. Twitches to electrical excitation of the nerve-scarce pelvic end of the muscle are also rapidly reduced. The results indicate that succinylcholine probably acts generally on the muscle membrance to diminish excitability.

Thalamic responses to peripheral nerve stimulation are depressed by activity in corticothalamic neurons. A subconvulsive dose of strychnine, given intravenously, changes this depression to enhancement."

https://openalex.org/W2009696649,"IN order to correct the deficient plasma thromboplastin generation in haemophilia, extraordinary amounts of antihaemophilic globulin are required1. This has been attributed to the inhibitory action of Bridge anticoagulant2. The fact that the latter is characteristically absent in serum3 prompted further investigations on the changes in the concentration of this inhibitor during the process of coagulation. The results (Table 1) revealed that full activity was maintained until the clotting of fibrinogen, following which event the anticoagulant rapidly became inert. Theoretically this meant that the removal of Bridge anticoagulant may be accomplished by one of three processes; adsorption on fibrin, destruction by thrombin or inactivation by a compound formed by thrombin-fibrinogen interaction."
