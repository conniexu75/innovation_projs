https://openalex.org/W2156537900,"Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses are now endemic in avian populations in Southeast Asia, and human cases continue to accumulate. Although currently incapable of sustained human-to-human transmission, H5N1 represents a serious pandemic threat owing to the risk of a mutation or reassortment generating a virus with increased transmissibility. Identifying public health interventions that might be able to halt a pandemic in its earliest stages is therefore a priority. Here we use a simulation model of influenza transmission in Southeast Asia to evaluate the potential effectiveness of targeted mass prophylactic use of antiviral drugs as a containment strategy. Other interventions aimed at reducing population contact rates are also examined as reinforcements to an antiviral-based containment policy. We show that elimination of a nascent pandemic may be feasible using a combination of geographically targeted prophylaxis and social distancing measures, if the basic reproduction number of the new virus is below 1.8. We predict that a stockpile of 3 million courses of antiviral drugs should be sufficient for elimination. Policy effectiveness depends critically on how quickly clinical cases are diagnosed and the speed with which antiviral drugs can be distributed."

Here we analyse tumours initiated by an endogenous oncogene, ras, and show that senescent cells exist in premalignant tumours but not in malignant ones. Senescence is therefore a defining feature of premalignant tumours that could prove valuable in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2162707016,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (subtype H5N1) is threatening to cause a human pandemic of potentially devastating proportions. We used a stochastic influenza simulation model for rural Southeast Asia to investigate the effectiveness of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, quarantine, and pre-vaccination in containing an emerging influenza strain at the source. If the basic reproductive number ( R 0 ) was below 1.60, our simulations showed that a prepared response with targeted antivirals would have a high probability of containing the disease. In that case, an antiviral agent stockpile on the order of 100,000 to 1 million courses for treatment and prophylaxis would be sufficient. If pre-vaccination occurred, then targeted antiviral prophylaxis could be effective for containing strains with an R 0 as high as 2.1. Combinations of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, pre-vaccination, and quarantine could contain strains with an R 0 as high as 2.4."

https://openalex.org/W2061519585,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1α (PGC1α) is a promiscuous co-activator that plays a key role in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and fuel homeostasis. Emergent evidence links decreased skeletal muscle PGC1α activity and coincident impairments in mitochondrial performance to the development of insulin resistance in humans. Here we used rodent models to demonstrate that muscle mitochondrial efficiency is compromised by diet-induced obesity and is subsequently rescued by exercise training. Chronic high fat feeding caused accelerated rates of incomplete fatty acid oxidation and accumulation of β-oxidative intermediates. The capacity of muscle mitochondria to fully oxidize a heavy influx of fatty acid depended on factors such as fiber type and exercise training and was positively correlated with expression levels of PGC1α. Likewise, an efficient lipid-induced substrate switch in cultured myocytes depended on adenovirus-mediated increases in PGC1α expression. Our results supported a novel paradigm in which a high lipid supply, occurring under conditions of low PGC1α, provokes a disconnect between mitochondrial β-oxidation and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. Conversely, the metabolic remodeling that occurred in response to PGC1α overexpression favored a shift from incomplete to complete β-oxidation. We proposed that PGC1α enables muscle mitochondria to better cope with a high lipid load, possibly reflecting a fundamental metabolic benefit of exercise training.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes are two closely associated diseases that continue to affect Westernized societies at epidemic rates (1Zimmet P. Alberti K.G. Shaw J. Nature. 2001; 414: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (4594) Google Scholar). Results from both epidemiological and animal studies suggest that the risk of developing these diseases is increased by consumption of a high fat diet (2Lichtenstein A.H. Schwab U.S. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 150: 227-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), which has been attributed in part to increased intramuscular triacylglycerol storage and adverse changes in skeletal muscle energy metabolism (3Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). Moreover, mounting evidence from animal and cell-based models indicates that lipid oversupply to skeletal muscle results in functional perturbations that eventually manifest as impaired insulin action (2Lichtenstein A.H. Schwab U.S. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 150: 227-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 4McGarry J.D.

Disord. 2003; 27: S6-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Together, these and other reports have established a compelling connection between muscle lipid dysregulation and impaired metabolic control at both the cellular and systemic levels. Despite intense investigation, a clear understanding of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms that mediate lipid-induced muscle dysfunction has remained elusive. Similar to high fat feeding, exercise training increases skeletal muscle supply and storage of lipid substrates (6Goodpaster B.H. He J. Watkins S. Kelley D.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 5755-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the adverse events provoked by a high fat diet, exercise is known to promote muscle as well as whole body metabolic fitness (7Astrup A. Public Health Nutr. 2001; 4: 499-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that physical activity somehow enhances the capacity of the muscle to tolerate and/or adapt to a high lipid load. Indeed, contractile activity leads to dramatic adjustments in oxidative fuel metabolism that are largely mediated by an increase in muscle mitochondrial biogenesis (8Adhihetty P.J. Irrcher I. Joseph A.M. Ljubicic V. Hood D.A. Exp. Physiol. 2003; 88: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, emergent evidence links muscle mitochondrial insufficiencies to the development of both age-related and inherited insulin resistance (9Patti M.E. Butte A.J. Crunkhorn S. Cusi K. Berria R. Kashyap S. Miyazaki Y. Kohane I. Costello M. Saccone R. Landaker E.J. Goldfine A.B. Mun E. Defronzo R. Finlayson J. Kahn C.R. Mandarino L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These reports prompted us to consider whether compromised muscle mitochondrial performance might be a central component of diet-induced obesity. We further reasoned that the anticipated mitochondrial abnormalities caused by lipid overload might be reversed by exercise training. Here we demonstrate that a high fat diet imposes a persistent lipid burden on muscle mitochondria, resulting in a disproportionate increase in incomplete compared with complete β-oxidation. The capacity of isolated mitochondria to fully oxidize a heavy influx of fatty acid depended on factors such as fiber type and exercise training and was positively correlated with expression levels of PPARγ co-activator-α (PGC1α), 2The abbreviations used are: PGC1α, PPARγ co-activator 1α; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; GOT, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase; HF, high fat; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; PGC1β, PPARγ co-activator 1β; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PDK4, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4; SC, standard chow; ANOVA, analysis of variance; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; ASM, acid-soluble metabolites; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; COXIV, cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV; NEFA, non-esterified fatty acid; FAM, N-(3-fluoranthyl)-maleimide (carboxyethylfluorescein). a promiscuous co-activator of most nuclear hormone receptors as well as several other transcription factors (15Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, PGC1α has been shown to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis via co-activation of the nuclear respiratory factor (16Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z.D. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar) and to regulate genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation through interactions with estrogen-related receptor α (17Mootha V.K. Handschin C. Arlow D. Xie X. St. Pierre J. Sihag S. Yang W. Altshuler D. Puigserver P. Patterson N. Willy P.J. Schulman I.G. Heyman R.A. Lander E.S. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6570-6575Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). PGC1α also co-activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), a family of lipid activated nuclear hormone receptors that play a key role in mediating adaptive regulation of muscle fatty acid oxidation (18Gilde A.J. Van Bilsen M. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2003; 178: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To test the role of PGC1α in permitting an efficient lipid-induced substrate switch, we evaluated metabolic adaptation to a high lipid supply in L6 myotubes that expressed high levels compared with low levels of the co-activator. In a manner that resembled exercise training, PGC1α coordinated the induction of β-oxidative enzymes with the activation of downstream metabolic pathways (e.g. tricarboxylic acid cycle), and thereby favored a shift from incomplete to complete oxidation of lipid substrates. The implications of these findings with respect to insulin resistance and its reversal by physical activity are discussed. Animal Studies—Wistar rats (300 g; Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) or male C57/Bl6J mice were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with a 12:12 h light/dark cycle and were provided ad libitum access to Purina standard chow (SC) or high fat diet (HF; Research Diets 45% fat) and water. On the day of the experiments, food was removed either 4 (fed) or 24 h (starved) before anesthesia was administered. Studies were conducted in accordance with Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Exercise and Denervation—Rats (n = 7) were habituated and treadmill-trained for 4 weeks as described previously (19Koves T.R. Noland R.C. Bates A.L. Henes S.T. Muoio D.M. Cortright R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1074-C1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Untrained rats (n = 7) served as controls. Effects of acute exercise were tested in mice (n = 10) that were subjected to 2-3-h bouts of treadmill running (0% incline, 20-28 m·min-1) separated by 1 h of rest and compared against rested controls (n = 10). Muscles were excised 12 h after the second bout of exercise. Effects of muscle inactivity were tested in mice that underwent right hind limb denervation by severing the sciatic nerve (n = 12) (20Jones J.P. Tapscott E.B. Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. Dohm G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 1661-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), compared against the contralateral sham-operated hind limb as a control. Muscles were excised 72 h after surgery. Mouse exercise training studies were performed in animals fed on either a SC or HF diet for 14 weeks. During the final 2 weeks of the diet, mice were kept sedentary or exercise-trained by voluntary wheel running (21Waters R.E. Rotevatn S. Li P. Annex B.H. Yan Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1342-C1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed 48 h after the last bout of voluntary running in mice that were fasted overnight (22Almind K. Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Isolation and Fatty Acid Oxidation—Muscle mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation, and mitochondrial integrity was assessed as described previously (19Koves T.R. Noland R.C. Bates A.L. Henes S.T. Muoio D.M. Cortright R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1074-C1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Kim J.Y. Koves T.R. Yu G.S. Gulick T. Cortright R.N. Dohm G.L. Muoio D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E1014-E1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of suspension buffer consisting of (in mm) 250 sucrose, 10 Tris-HCl, 1 EDTA, and 2 ATP, pH 7.4. Fatty acid oxidation was conducted using 40 μl of the final mitochondrial suspensions incubated in the presence of 160 μl of an oxidation buffer containing (in mm) 0.150 oleate, ([1-14C]oleate, at 0.5 μCi ml-1), 100 sucrose, 10 Tris-HCl, 10 KH2PO4, 100 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 l-carnitine, 0.1 malate, 2 ATP, 0.05 coenzyme A, 1 dithiothreitol, and 0.3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C (19Koves T.R. Noland R.C. Bates A.L. Henes S.T. Muoio D.M. Cortright R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1074-C1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 70% perchloric acid. 14CO2 was trapped in 200 μl of 1 n NaOH. 14C-Labeled acid-soluble metabolites (ASM) and 14CO2 fractions were quantified by liquid scintillation counting, and data were normalized to mitochondrial protein. L6 Muscle Cells—L6 myoblasts (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown on 6- or 12-well collagen-coated plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 mg/ml gentamycin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until ∼80% confluent. Cells were induced to differentiate into myotubes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% horse serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (differentiation medium). On day 2, cells were treated with 20 μl (4 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml) of purified adenovirus per 500,000 cells and then 24 h later with vehicle or fatty acids. Myotubes were harvested 24 h after fatty acid treatment for isolation of protein and RNA. Fatty acid oxidation assays were performed following incubations in 500 μl of differentiation medium plus 12.5 mm HEPES, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1.0 mm carnitine, 100-500 μm sodium oleate, and 1.0 μCi/ml [14C]oleate (Sigma) for 3 h at 37 °C. Medium was transferred to new dishes and assayed for labeled oxidation products (CO2 and ASM) as described previously (24Muoio D.M. Way J.M. Tanner C.J. Winegar D.A. Kliewer S.A. Houmard J.A. Kraus W.E. Dohm G.L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Cells washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline were harvested in 200 μl of 0.05% SDS, and lysates were stored at -80 °C for protein determination. Western Blotting—L6 cell and gastrocnemius tissue lysates were homogenized directly in loading buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 143 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% SDS supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined from cell and tissue extracts using the RC/DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Twenty μg of cellular protein or 40 μg of gastrocnemius lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE 4-12% BisTris gradient gel and MOPS electrophoresis buffers (Invitrogen), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed overnight with either PGC1α (1:1000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), COXIV (1:1000; MitoSciences, Eugene, OR), or α-tubulin (1:20,000; Sigma) antibodies. Proteins were visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulin G antibodies and ECL Plus chemiluminescence detection kit and were quantified by using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant Adenovirus—Recombinant adenovirus encoding mouse PGC1α (AdCMV-PGC1α) was a kind gift from Dr. Bruce Spiegelman. Recombinant adenoviruses encoding β-galactosidase (AdCMV-β-gal) or green fluorescent protein (AdCMV-GFP) were used to control for nonspecific effects of virus treatment. The adenoviruses were amplified and purified using methods published previously (25Becker T.C. BeltrandelRio H. Noel R.J. Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21234-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acylcarnitine Profiling—Ten mg of powdered muscle tissue was transferred to a chilled 1-ml Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer containing 0.3 ml of distilled, de-ionized water. Samples were subjected to 20 strokes and immediately transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and sonicated at 2.5 watts for 5 s and then subsequently processed as described previously (26An J. Muoio D.M. Shiota M. Fujimoto Y. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. Koves T.R. Stevens R. Millington D. Newgard C.B. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Acylcarnitines were measured by direct-injection electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, using a Micromass Quattro Micro™ system equipped with a model 2777 autosampler, a model 1525 high pressure liquid chromatography solvent delivery system, and a data system running 4.0 MassLynx software (Waters, Milford, MA). Whole-cell Polarographic Measurements—L6 myotubes grown on 15-cm collagen-coated plates were treated with control (β-galactosidase) or PGC1α recombinant adenoviruses and harvested after 48 h. Myocytes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and centrifuged at 800 × g. Cell pellets were washed twice and resuspended in 700 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm HEPES, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and either no additional substrate, 10 mm glucose, or 100 μm palmitate. Small aliquots of the cell suspension (50-200 μl) were added to a final volume of 500 μl, and oxygen consumption was determined using an OxyTherm system (Hansatech Instruments, Norfolk, UK) calibrated at 37 °C. Uncoupled respiration was stimulated by the addition of 2 μm FCCP. Transcriptional Profiling by Microarray and Real Time Quantitative PCR—High quality RNA was isolated using the RNeasy total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For muscle tissues, RNA was isolated from 10 to 20 mg of soleus, extensor digitorum longus, or gastrocnemius muscle using the RNeasy fibrous tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA quality was verified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and quantified using RiboGreen reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For cell studies, L6 myotubes were grown on collagen-coated 6-well plates and treated for 48 h with control (β-galactosidase) or PGC1α in the presence or absence of 500 μm sodium oleate for 24 h. RNA from day 4 myotubes was harvested during two separate experiments that were performed in triplicate. Pooled samples from each treatment group were analyzed at the Duke University DNA Microarray Center using the Rat Genome Oligo Set version 1.1 custom-printed microarray (Operon, Huntsville, AL) that was prepared with a GeneMachines OmniGrid arrayer (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI). Samples were analyzed against a reference standard, and the raw microarray data were imported into GeneSpring 5.1 software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA). After Lowess transformation normalization, the data were screened for genes having spot intensities of “present” or “marginal.” Cross-gene error model was set for deviation from 1.0, and relevant genes were limited to those having changed at least 1.5-fold. The resulting annotated list was used for GeneSpring pathway analysis to detect coordinated changes in lipid-related metabolic pathways. cDNA for real time PCR was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using the IScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) in a 20-μl reaction volume and diluted 5-fold for subsequent reverse transcription-PCR. Results from the pooled-sample fluorescent microarray analysis were validated by real time quantitative PCR using a Prism 7000 with TaqMan chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to measure differentially expressed genes in individual samples. Sequence-specific primers and probes were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequences for the mouse genes were as follows: PGC1α, forward, 5′-GCACCAGCCAACACTCA-3′, reverse, 5′-TGGGTGTGGTTTGCTGCA-3′, and probe, 5′-FAM-ACAATGAATGCAGCGGTC-3′; PGC1β, forward, 5′-GCTCTCTTGGCTGCGCTTA-3′, reverse, 5′-ACGATGTGGGGCTG-3′, and probe, 5′-FAM-AAGACCCTGGATGACATCC. All other genes were assessed using predesigned/prevalidated FAM-labeled Assays-on-Demand from Applied Biosystems and normalized using values from a duplexed reaction with VIC-labeled 18 S endogenous control gene (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Statistics—Data were analyzed by Student's t test or by analysis of variance (ANOVA). ANOVA was performed on data at a minimum p < 0.05 threshold, and a multiple comparison Fisher's post hoc test was performed to evaluate differences between exercise and/or dietary treatments with JMP software version 5 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Data are shown as means ± S.E. Physiological Regulation of Fatty Acid Oxidation in Skeletal Muscle Mitochondria—Muscles that are exercise-trained or enriched in type I (red) myofibers exhibit enhanced fatty acid oxidative capacity compared with their sedentary or type II (white) muscle counterparts. To determine whether these properties are due strictly to differences in mitochondrial content or, alternatively, could reflect distinctions in mitochondrial performance, we evaluated [1-14C]palmitate oxidation in isolated rat muscle mitochondria. Most strikingly, we found that oxidation rates (expressed per g mitochondrial protein) in mitochondria from the deep red gastrocnemius were 8-fold higher than those from the superficial white gastrocnemius (Fig. 1A). Similarly, exercise training, which causes a shift in muscle fiber composition, increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidative capacity ∼2-fold over the sedentary condition (Fig. 1B). Exercise-trained and/or type I skeletal muscles are also characterized by increased lipid uptake and elevated intramuscular triacylglycerol storage (6Goodpaster B.H. He J. Watkins S. Kelley D.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 5755-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 27Cortright R.N. Muoio D.M. Dohm G.L. Nutr. Biochem. 1997; 8: 228-245Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, lipid-induced increases in PPAR transcriptional activity could contribute to enhanced mitochondrial β-oxidative capacity. In order to assess whether a change in fatty acid supply would be sufficient to alter mitochondrial lipid metabolism, we next evaluated muscle mitochondria from rats that were starved 24 h or fed a high fat diet for 10 weeks. Similar to previous studies by our laboratory (26An J. Muoio D.M. Shiota M. Fujimoto Y. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. Koves T.R. Stevens R. Millington D. Newgard C.B. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 28Muoio D.M. MacLean P.S. Lang D.B. Li S. Houmard J.A. Way J.M. Winegar D.A. Corton J.C. Dohm G.L. Kraus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26089-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and others (29de Fourmestraux V. Neubauer H. Poussin C. Farmer P. Falquet L. Burcelin R. Delorenzi M. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50743-50753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), both manipulations increased circulating nonesterified free fatty acids by ∼2-fold and coincidentally increased mRNA expression of several known PPAR target genes (not shown). However, unlike the exercise and fiber type models, neither of the nutritional maneuvers enhanced the capacity of the muscle mitochondria to fully oxidize palmitate to CO2 (Fig. 1C). In these studies we also measured label incorporation into chain-shortened ASM, which provide an index of incomplete β-oxidation. Compared with the SC-fed condition, both starvation and HF feeding increased 14C label incorporation into the ASM fraction by 36 and 27%, respectively (Fig. 1D). ASM production was greatest in muscle mitochondria from HF rats harvested in the starved condition. In Vivo Metabolic Analysis by Acylcarnitine Profiling—To gain further insight into diet-induced changes in mitochondrial function, we employed tandem mass spectrometry to profile mitochondrially derived acylcarnitine esters in muscles from rats fed either a SC or a HF diet. The acylcarnitine analysis provides a comprehensive snapshot of in vivo substrate flux through specific steps of the β-oxidative spiral and is thus commonly used as a diagnostic tool to detect inborn metabolic errors (30Van Hove J.L. Zhang W. Kahler S.G. Roe C.R. Chen Y.T. Terada N. Chace D.H. Iafolla A.K. Ding J.H. Millington D.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 52: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar). Here and in previous studies we have found this to be an effective method for screening diet and/or obesity-related metabolic abnormalities (26An J. Muoio D.M. Shiota M. Fujimoto Y. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. Koves T.R. Stevens R. Millington D. Newgard C.B. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In rats fed the SC diet, starvation increased several medium and long chain acylcarnitine intermediates, consistent with increased fatty acid delivery and high rates of β-oxidation that occur in the fasted condition (Fig. 1G). In muscles from HF-fed animals, most lipid-derived (even chain) acylcarnitine intermediates were persistently elevated (compared with the SC-fed group), but increased only modestly during the fed-to-starved transition. In contrast, muscle levels of isovaleryl-carnitine (C5), which is derived from the catabolism of leucine, were higher in the SC compared with the HF group but were unaffected by fasting. The lowering of this metabolite by the HF diet most likely reflects a mitochondrial substrate switch from branched chain amino acids to fatty acids. In general, the nutritionally induced changes in the acylcarnitine profile are consistent with the notion that starvation and HF feeding increase mitochondrial rates of incomplete β-oxidation. Transcriptional Regulation of PGC1α and PGC1β in Skeletal Muscle—The results presented in Fig. 1 suggested that under some circumstances PPAR activation alone is insufficient to enhance the potential of muscle mitochondria to fully oxidize lipid substrates. As we considered other factors that may be important in regulating mitochondrial function, the transcriptional co-activators PGC1α and PGC1β emerged as attractive candidates. Both PGC1 isoforms have been implicated as master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and important modulators of PPAR activity. In liver, heart, and brown adipose tissue, PGC1α and PGC1β are transcriptionally regulated by various nutritional and/or energy stresses (31Spiegelman B.M. Heinrich R. Cell. 2004; 119: 157-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We therefore proceeded to investigate skeletal muscle mRNA expression of both PGC1 isoforms under a variety of physiological conditions (Fig. 2). Expression of PGC1α was 4.5-fold greater in soleus (red) than in gastrocnemius (mixed) or extensor digitorum longus (white) muscle, whereas conversely, PGC1β mRNA was most abundant in the extensor digitorum longus muscle (Fig. 2A). An acute bout of exercise increased PGC1α expression 2.2-fold in the gastrocnemius muscle (Fig. 2B), whereas denervation (a model of inactivity) provoked a 50% decrease in expression levels (Fig. 2C). In contrast, neither exercise nor denervation altered expression of PGC1β (Fig. 2, B and C). Chronic high fat feeding resulted in a marked decrease (∼80%) in soleus muscle PGC1α but no significant change in PGC1β (Fig. 2D). Starvation also tended to decrease PGC1α. Thus, transcriptional regulation of PGC1α, but not PGC1β, correlated with changes in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation capacity (Fig. 1). This expression pattern indicates that PGC1α and PGC1β are differentially responsive to energy stress and suggests that the α isoform plays a primary role in mediating adaptive changes in muscle mitochondrial function. Overexpression of PGC1 in L6 Muscle Cells—Data from our animal models implied that PGC1α may permit more efficient adaptation to a high lipid environment. To test this hypothesis, we used recombinant adenovirus to increase the normally low levels of PGC1α expressed in rat L6 myotubes. Subsequent experiments then evaluated the transcriptional and metabolic consequences of a 24-h fatty acid challenge in cells expressing high compared with low PGC1α activity. Preliminary studies using recombinant adenoviruses encoding either β-galactosidase or green fluorescent protein confirmed high efficiency transduction of differentiated myotubes (Fig. 3A). Likewise, both PGC1α mRNA and protein levels increased dose-dependently with an increasing titer of rAd-CMV-PGC1α (Fig. 3, B and C). Similar to previous reports, PGC1α overexpression caused a marked induction of the COXIV protein (Fig. 3D), consistent with an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis. Microarray Analysis of PGC1α-mediated Reprogramming of Muscle Cells—We used DNA microarray analysis to gain a more comprehensive perspective of how PGC1α modulates transcriptional responses to lipid exposure (TABLE ONE). Treatment of myocytes with high fatty acid resulted in predictable increases in the expression of several classic PPAR-targeted genes involved in fatty acid catabolism (PDHK4, 2.7-fold; UCP2, 2.2-fold; AAC2, 1.7-fold; and ECH1, 1.7-fold). Fatty acid exposure alone produced little or no effects on transcripts associated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle or the electron transport chain. In contrast, PGC1α overexpression not only activated several β-oxidative and lipid trafficking genes but also triggered the global induction of genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle,"

This technology has not so far been successful in dogs because of the difficulty of maturing canine oocytes in vitro. Here we describe the cloning of two Afghan hounds by nuclear transfer from adult skin cells into oocytes that had matured in vivo. Together with detailed sequence information generated by the canine-genome project, the ability to clone dogs by somatic-cell nuclear transfer should help to determine genetic and environmental contributions to the diverse biological and behavioural traits associated with the many different canine breeds."

https://openalex.org/W1966698790,"Information—be it classical1 or quantum2—is measured by the amount of communication needed to convey it. In the classical case, if the receiver has some prior information about the messages being conveyed, less communication is needed3. Here we explore the concept of prior quantum information: given an unknown quantum state distributed over two systems, we determine how much quantum communication is needed to transfer the full state to one system. This communication measures the partial information one system needs, conditioned on its prior information. We find that it is given by the conditional entropy—a quantity that was known previously, but lacked an operational meaning. In the classical case, partial information must always be positive, but we find that in the quantum world this physical quantity can be negative. If the partial information is positive, its sender needs to communicate this number of quantum bits to the receiver; if it is negative, then sender and receiver instead gain the corresponding potential for future quantum communication. We introduce a protocol that we term ‘quantum state merging’ which optimally transfers partial information. We show how it enables a systematic understanding of quantum network theory, and discuss several important applications including distributed compression, noiseless coding with side information, multiple access channels and assisted entanglement distillation."

https://openalex.org/W2046211696,"Outbreaks of many infectious diseases, including cholera, malaria and dengue, vary over characteristic periods longer than 1 year. Evidence that climate variability drives these interannual cycles has been highly controversial, chiefly because it is difficult to isolate the contribution of environmental forcing while taking into account nonlinear epidemiological dynamics generated by mechanisms such as host immunity. Here we show that a critical interplay of environmental forcing, specifically climate variability, and temporary immunity explains the interannual disease cycles present in a four-decade cholera time series from Matlab, Bangladesh. We reconstruct the transmission rate, the key epidemiological parameter affected by extrinsic forcing, over time for the predominant strain (El Tor) with a nonlinear population model that permits a contributing effect of intrinsic immunity. Transmission shows clear interannual variability with a strong correspondence to climate patterns at long periods (over 7 years, for monsoon rains and Brahmaputra river discharge) and at shorter periods (under 7 years, for flood extent in Bangladesh, sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation). The importance of the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors in determining disease dynamics is illustrated during refractory periods, when population susceptibility levels are low as the result of immunity and the size of cholera outbreaks only weakly reflects climate forcing."

To investigate the role of PINK1 in neurodegeneration, we designed human and murine neuronal cell lines expressing either wild-type PINK1 or PINK1 bearing a mutation associated with Parkinson Disease. We show that under basal and staurosporine-induced conditions, the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells was lower in wild-type PINK1 expressing SH-SY5Y cells than in mock-transfected cells. This phenotype was due to a PINK1-mediated reduction in cytochrome c release from mitochondria, which prevents subsequent caspase-3 activation. We show that overexpression of wild-type PINK1 strongly reduced both basal and staurosporine-induced caspase 3 activity. Overexpression of wild-type PINK1 also reduced the levels of cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3, caspase-7, and activated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase under both basal and staurosporine-induced conditions.

PINK1 encodes a highly conserved, 581-amino acid, putative serinethreonine protein kinase and is a member of a small family of novel kinases including CLIK1 (CLP-36 interacting kinase)/PDLIM1 kinases. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that residues Gly-193 to Leu-507 comprise the catalytic domain, residues Gly-193 to Lys-219 form the ATP-binding cassette (with Tyr-166 as an autophosphorylated regulatory residue), and residues Asp-384 to Glu-417 form an activation loop (Fig. 1). PINK1 is transcriptionally transactivated by the PTEN gene (9Unoki M. Nakamura Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and is expressed at variable levels in different cancer cell types. Valente et al. showed that overexpressed, epitope-tagged PINK1 localized to mitochondria and may have a protective function against cell death (1Valente E.M. Abou-Sleiman P.M. Caputo V. Muqit M.M. Harvey K. Gispert S. Ali Z. Del Turco D. Bentivoglio A.R. Healy D.G. Albanese A. Nussbaum R. Gonzalez-Maldonado R. Deller T. Salvi S. Cortelli P. Gilks W.P. Latchman D.S. Harvey R.J. Dallapiccola B. Auburger G. Wood N.W. Science. 2004; 304: 1158-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of PINK1 in neuronal apoptosis, we overexpressed this protein in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and N2a murine neurons. Here we report that wild-type PINK1 prevents neuronal apoptosis under both basal and staurosporine-induced apoptotic conditions. We demonstrate that PINK1 reduces neuronal apoptosis by reducing the release of cytochrome c, thereby limiting the subsequent activation of caspases-9, -7, and -3 and PARP. We show that this protective effect is abrogated by PD-related mutations and by rendering the kinase inactive through removal of a key lysine residue in the catalytic domain (Lys-219). Cloning and Reverse Transcription PCR—Human PINK1 cDNA was obtained from OriGene TrueClone and mutated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using appropriate oligonucleotide primers to generate human PINK1 bearing E240K and/or L489P clinical mutants and the K219M mutant. After validation by DNA sequencing using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer from Applied Biosystems), the cDNAs were subcloned into the pCDNA4 or 6 (Invitrogen). Design of PINK1 Antibody—Polyclonal rabbit anti-PINK1 antiserum was raised against the 24-residue sequence (AVRQALGRGLQLGRALLLRFTGKP) at the N terminus of PINK1. Following affinity purification, the antiserum (LWP2) was diluted to 1:2500 for Western blots. The other antibodies are described in the following paragraphs. Cell Culture Conditions and Transfections—SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and N2a murine neurons were grown in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Stable and transient transfectants expressing wild-type untagged PINK1 were obtained after transfection with 4 μg of PINK1 cDNA by means of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Positive transfectants were screened for their PINK1 immunoreactivity as described below. Cells were used 48 h after transfection. For stable transfections, at least 10 clones were analyzed for each construct. Human Skin Fibroblasts Primary Cultures—With informed consent, forearm skin biopsies were performed on both a 74-year-old male Parkinson disease patient with a pathogenic compound heterozygous E240K/L489P mutation in the PINK1 gene and a 76-year-old neurological normal male (2Rogaeva E.

Neurol. 2004; 61: 1898-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). ∼300 mg of tissue were immediately placed in 10 ml of transport media (α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Wisent) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin). Under sterile conditions, the biopsies were each placed in a 60-mm tissue culture dish and cut with a scalpel into small pieces. 5 ml of serum-free medium (Wisent) containing 394 units of collagenase (C9263 from Sigma) were added to the tissue and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The tissue and medium were then transferred to a 15-ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of citrate saline solution containing 0.05% trypsin (DIFCO) and 0.53 mm EDTA (Sigma), incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, then centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. After removing the supernatant, the pellet was gently resuspended in 5 ml of transport media. The cell suspension was then placed in a T125 flask and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 1 week, sufficient growth was seen for subculturing to begin. Cultured skin fibroblasts were maintained in α-minimal essential medium containing 11 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Wisent). Confocal Studies—Immunofluorescence was performed as described (10Yang D.S. Tandon A. Chen F. Yu G. Yu H. Arawaka S. Hasegawa H. Duthie M. Schmidt S.D. Ramabhadran T.V. Nixon R.A. Mathews P.M.

Briefly, transiently transfected SH-SY5Y cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.02% Triton X-100 (v/v) in Tris-buffered saline. PINK1 immunoreactivity was detected using monoclonal anti-V5 antibodies (Invitrogen), and mitochondria and nuclei were labeled with MitoTracker Red and ToPro3 (Molecular Probes), respectively, as per the vendors' instructions. Immunofluorescence was visualized with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antiserum (Molecular Probes), and serial z-stacked images were collected using the Radiance2000 (Bio-Rad) confocal microscope and compiled with Confocal Assistant 4.01. Induction of Cell Death and Caspase-3 Activity Measurements—Stable or transient transfectants were preincubated with or without staurosporine (2 μm) for 3 h, and then caspase-3 activity was fluorometrically measured as detailed extensively (11da Costa C.A. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Caspase 3 activity is considered as the Ac-DEVD-al-sensitive Ac-DEVD-7AMC hydrolyzing activity (11da Costa C.A. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cell Fractionation and Cytochrome c Purification—Proteins were extracted 3 h after treatment with or without 2 μm staurosporine. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor set (Roche Applied Science). Homogenates were centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were recentrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended and contained mitochondrial proteins. The resulting supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting pellet contained microsomal fractions. The remaining supernatants contained cytosolic proteins. The protein blots were incubated with a monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) for PINK1-V5 detection, a monoclonal anti-OxPhos complex IV subunit II antibody (Molecular Probes) as a molecular marker for mitochondrial fraction purification, a polyclonal anti-GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa) antibody (Sigma) for a microsomal marker, and a polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody as a cytosolic marker. Immunoreactivity was detected with the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analyses—For the detection of wild-type untagged PINK1, 50 μg were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and Western blotted with the LWP2 anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody. V5-tagged PINK1 and FLAG-tagged PINK1 were detected on Western blot with a monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) and a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), respectively. Antiactin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Active caspase-3, -7, and -9 and PARP were separated on 10–20% gradient Tricine gels (Invitrogen), and a Western blot was performed using anti-active caspase-3, antiactive caspase-7, anti-active caspase-9, and anti-cleaved PARP antibodies (R&D Systems). Immunological complexes were revealed as described previously (12Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were established by the Bradford method. TUNEL Method—For DNA nick end labeling, SH-SY5Y cells were grown on slides. Slides were immersed in 4% methanol-free formaldehyde diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were permeabilized with Triton® X-100 and then processed for the dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL technique according to manufacturer's protocol (DeadEnd™ Colorimetric TUNEL system from Promega). The DNA label corresponds to brown spots (Fig. 2B). Bioinformatic Studies—PSORT and MitoProt web-based tools were used to assess the presence of protein sorting and localization signals in PINK1. PSORT predicts protein sorting signals and localization sites from input amino acid sequences. PSORT predicts that PINK1 has a 34.8% probability of being targeted to the mitochondria (psort.nibb.ac.jp/). MitoProt is designed to identify the N-terminal regions of input proteins that have the ability to support a mitochondrial targeting sequence and predict a cleavage site (ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot.html). The MitoProt tool suggests that there is a 0.9948 probability that the first 35 amino acid residues of the human PINK1 protein target it for mitochondrial localization. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed with PRISM software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) by using the Newman Keuls multiple comparison test for one-way analysis of variance. We have recently identified the first reported compound heterozygous mutation (E240K and L489P) in a family with early onset Parkinson disease (2Rogaeva E. Johnson J. Lang A.E. Gulick C. Gwinn-Hardy K. Kawarai T. Sato C. Morgan A. Werner J. Nussbaum R. Petit A. Okun M.S. McInerney A. Mandel R. Groen J.L. Fernandez H.H. Postuma R. Foote K.D. Salehi-Rad S. Liang Y. Reimsnider S. Tandon A. Hardy J. St George-Hyslop P. Singleton A.B. Arch. Neurol. 2004; 61: 1898-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We therefore created PINK1 cDNA constructs containing the following: 1) a human wild-type PINK1; 2) the PD-related E240K PINK1 mutant; 3) the PD-related L489P PINK1 mutant; 4) a double mutation (E240K/L489P); and 5) an artificial kinase dead mutant (K219M) that eliminated the Lys-219 residue that is predicted to be critical for the putative kinase activity of PINK1 (Fig. 1). Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with wild-type human PINK1 express a ∼63-kDa protein recognized by our rabbit polyclonal antibody (named LWP2) that is directed against the first 24 amino acids at the N terminus of human PINK1 including the mitochondrial targeting motif (Fig. 2A). The observed molecular mass of ∼63 kDa corresponds to the expected molecular mass for an unprocessed PINK1 holoprotein. To investigate the role of PINK1 in cell death, we first used the TUNEL method to assess the percentage of apoptotic cells under basal and staurosporine-treated conditions in SH-SY5Y cells that were either stably expressing an empty vector (mock) or stably expressing wild-type PINK1. Under basal conditions, mock-transfected SH-SY5Y cells displayed only a small proportion of TUNEL-positive cells (7.8 ± 1.5%). However, as expected, the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells (26.3 ± 3.5%) was strongly increased after a 3-h treatment with 2 μm staurosporine, a widely used inductor of apoptosis (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, in SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing wild-type PINK1 the number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly reduced under both basal (2.3 ± 0.6%) and staurosporine-stimulated conditions (8.3 ± 2.1%) (Fig. 2, B and C). To examine the effect of PINK1 expression on caspase-3 activity, we first transiently transfected SH-SY5Y cells with the following: 1) wild-type untagged PINK1; 2) C-terminally V5-tagged wild-type PINK1; or 3) N-terminally FLAG-tagged wild-type PINK1 (Fig. 3A). On Western blots the N-terminally directed LWP2 and FLAG antibodies detected both untagged PINK1 and N-terminally FLAG-tagged PINK1 as a single unprocessed ∼63-kDa holoprotein (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and 4, respectively). In contrast, the anti-V5 antibody, directed to the C-terminally V5-tagged PINK1, detects both the unprocessed full-length protein and a series of shorter peptides, which may reflect processed derivatives from which the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting motif has been removed (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). Transient expression of each of the wild-type PINK1 constructs drastically reduced the basal caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3C) and the immunoreactivity of an activation-specific anti-caspase-3 antibody (Fig. 3D). This PINK1-mediated reduction of basal caspase-3 activity was also found in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 3E) and in murine N2a neurons (Fig. 3F) stably overexpressing untagged wild-type PINK1. The stable overexpression of PINK1 also caused a 30% reduction in the caspase-3 activity following staurosporine stimulation of apoptotic pathways (Fig. 3G). Taken together, these results show that the effect of wild-type PINK1 in blocking the activation of apoptotic signaling pathways is highly reproducible and not cell type-specific. Bioinformatic studies using PSORT and MitoProt web-based tools predict a mitochondrial localization of PINK1. In agreement with this, Valente et al. (1Valente E.M. Abou-Sleiman P.M. Caputo V.

In SH-SY5Y cells, immunocytochemical studies showed that C-terminally V5-tagged PINK1 distributes to punctate cytoplasmic structures, some of which overlap with perinuclear MitoTracker staining (Fig. 4A). The pattern of immunofluorescence was not affected by either the artificial K219M kinase-inactivating mutation or the PD-associated mutations (Fig. 4A). In accord with this, subcellular fractionation also revealed that C-terminally V5-tagged PINK1 distributes to mitochondrial and microsomal fractions, but only minimally to the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4B). This mitochondrial localization, together with the reduction of caspase-3 activity triggered by PINK1 overexpression, led us to investigate the effect of PINK1 on cytochrome c translocation from mitochondria into the cytosol. As expected, the induction of apoptosis by staurosporine leads to an increase in cytosolic cytochrome c in SH-SY5Ycells (Fig. 4C). There was a significant reduction in the staurosporine-induced translocation of cytochrome c into the cytosol of cells overexpressing either C-terminally V5-tagged (74%) or untagged wild-type PINK1 (50%) (Fig. 4C). However, the same staurosporine treatment did not trigger a translocation of PINK1 between mitochondrial, microsomal, and cytosolic fractions. This latter result suggests that the effect of PINK1 is likely mediated directly through the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria rather than by altering the subcellular distribution of PINK1 itself (Fig. 4B). The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria allows its binding to the apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1)-caspase-9-dATP complex and triggers activation of caspase-9, which then triggers the apoptotic cascade by successively activating other caspases like caspase-3 (Fig. 5A). Thus, we wondered whether the reductions in cytochrome c translocation, caspase-3 activity, and caspase-3 immunoreactivity were associated with changes in the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-7 and cleavage of PARP. Using specific antibodies, we analyzed by Western blotting the amounts of active, cleaved caspase-9, -7, and -3 and PARP in SH-SY5Y cells that were expressing either empty vector (mock) or stably transfected untagged PINK1 under basal and staurosporine-stimulated conditions (Fig. 5B). Under basal conditions, SH-SY5Y cells with wild-type untagged PINK1 (Fig. 5B) tended to display lower levels of cleaved caspase-9, -7, and -3 compared with mock-transfected cells. As expected, under staurosporine-induced apoptotic conditions we observed elevated immunoreactivity of cleaved caspase-9, -3, -7 and of the active form of PARP, but this increase was significantly attenuated in PINK1-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). Cumulatively, these results suggest that the reduction of cytochrome c translocation due to PINK1 overexpression limits the activation of the other downstream members of the apoptotic cascade (Fig. 5, A and B). The levels of actin (Fig. 5B, bottom section) and PINK1 were not affected by a 3-h treatment with staurosporine (Fig. 5C). To investigate the effect of PD-related mutations in PINK1 and to determine whether PINK1 kinase activity was required for the antiapoptotic effect of PINK1, we transiently transfected SH-SY5Y cells with the following: 1) wild-type PINK1; 2) PD-related mutant PINK1 cDNAs (E240K PINK1, L489P PINK1, or E240K/L489P PINK1); or 3) catalytically dead PINK1 (K219M). Mutant PINK1 proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-FLAG or V5 antibodies, which again identified either the ∼ 63-kDa unprocessed holoprotein (anti-FLAG; Fig. 6B, right) or the holoprotein and a series of shorter peptides, reflecting the normal processing of the putative mitochondrial targeting sequence (anti-V5; Fig. 6B, left). These experiments again replicated the inhibitory effect of wild-type PINK1 on basal caspase-3 activity (70.4% ± 7.3 in wild-type V5-PINK1-expressing cells and 62.3% ± 6.2 in PINK1-FLAG cells compared with mock-transfected cells, Fig. 6A). In contrast, the presence of PD-related mutations (single E240K, L489P, or double E240K/L489P) totally abolished the inhibitory effect of wild-type PINK1 on caspase-3 activation. Indeed, E240K V5-PINK1 mutant-expressing cells displayed 111.1% ± 8.1 caspase-3 activity, L489P V5-PINK1-expressing cells displayed 118.5% ± 13.2 caspase activity, and E240K/L489P V5-PINK1-expressing cells displayed 93.5% ± 6.9 caspase-3 activity values, which were not statistically different from those of mock-transfected control cells (p = not significant (ns); Fig. 6A). Similar results were observed in cells expressing FLAG-tagged PINK1, where double E240K/L489P PINK1-FLAG mutant-expressing cells displayed caspase-3 levels comparable with those of mock-transfected cells (p = not significant (ns); Fig. 6A). These results were not explained by the differing levels of expression of the mutant PINK1 proteins. In the same experiment, we also investigated the effect of the C-terminally V5-tagged or N-terminally FLAG-tagged “kinase dead” K219M PINK1 mutant constructs. These kinase dead mutant constructs behaved in SH-SY5Y cells in exactly the same way as the PD-related PINK1 mutants. Indeed, they totally abolished the inhibitory effect of PINK1 on caspase-3 activation (98.4% ± 6.1 and 85.5 ± 4.5 for K219M V5-PINK1 and K219M PINK1-FLAG, respectively, p = not significant (ns); Fig. 6A). Finally, we obtained primary cultures of human skin fibroblasts from a neurologically normal elderly male and from a 74-year-old male familial PD patient with the compound E204K/L489P mutation in PINK1 (2Rogaeva E. Johnson J. Lang A.E. Gulick C. Gwinn-Hardy K. Kawarai T. Sato C. Morgan A. Werner J. Nussbaum R. Petit A. Okun M.S. McInerney A. Mandel R. Groen J.L. Fernandez H.H. Postuma R. Foote K.D.

Reverse transcription PCR studies confirmed that PINK1 mRNA is robustly expressed in the fibroblasts of both the normal control and the PINK1 mutant carrier. The analysis of basal caspase-3 activity in cell lysates of the fibroblasts from the PD patient showed much higher basal caspase-3 activity than the lysates of fibroblasts from the age-matched control (147.7% ± 12.9 in E204K/L489P mutant PINK1 fibroblasts compared with control; Fig. 6C). Although this result is limited to primary cultures of fibroblasts from a single PINK1 mutation carrier, it is nevertheless consistent with the results of the other studies using cell lines overexpressing exogenous PINK1. The etiology of Parkinson disease is complex and poorly understood. Toxins such as rotenone and N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which inhibit complex I activity in the mitochondrial electron transport system, can induce parkinsonism. Reduced complex I activity has been reported in PD not only in the substantia nigra but also in the skeletal muscle and platelets. These and other observations have led to the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction, which generates oxidative stress, contributes to the etiology of PD (reviewed in Ref. 13Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial localization of PINK1 and the putative role that mitochondria play in PD neurodegeneration suggest that PINK1 may have a modulating effect on mitochondrially dependent cell death pathways. In the present study we therefore investigated the role of PINK1 in basal and staurosporine-induced neuronal apoptosis. Our results establish that in neuronal cells both transient and stable expression of PINK1 did the following: 1) prevented basal and staurosporine-induced cytochrome c translocation from mitochondria to the cytosol; 2) reduced activation of caspase-9, -7, and -3 and PARP; 3) prevented TUNEL-positive DNA fragmentation; and 4) strongly reduced both basal apoptotic activity and staurosporine-induced cell death. These results are likely to be highly relevant to the role of PINK1 mutants in vivo, because primary cultured human skin fibroblasts expressing PD-related PINK1 also displayed a much higher basal apoptotic activity compared with fibroblasts from a normal individual or neuronal cells expressing wild-type PINK1. Importantly, PINK1 localization itself does not appear to be modified by apoptosis induction, suggesting that the anti-apoptotic effect of PINK1 is likely to be mediated by direct or indirect effects on the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade. We have previously predicted that both of two missense mutations (E240K and L489P) observed in a compound heterozygous patient with PD affect residues within the predicted catalytic domain of PINK1 and are likely to alter PINK1 activity (2Rogaeva E. Johnson J. Lang A.E. Gulick C. Gwinn-Hardy K. Kawarai T. Sato C. Morgan A. Werner J. Nussbaum R. Petit A. Okun M.S. McInerney A. Mandel R. Groen J.L. Fernandez H.H. Postuma R. Foote K.D.

In the present study, we have shown that the presence of either one of these mutations totally abrogates the basal PINK1 protection against cell death, confirming that they do indeed affect PINK1 function, either through loss of the catalytic activity and/or through instability of the mutant protein. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the artificial K219M kinase dead PINK1 mutant is also totally inactive against basal and induced apoptosis. These results are strikingly similar to those recently demonstrated for another protein involved in PD, namely α-synuclein. Wild-type but not mutant α-synuclein also limited cell death triggered by serum withdrawal (14Lee M. Hyun D. Halliwell B. Jenner P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic function of wild-type PINK1 suggests that altered phosphorylation of one or more target proteins might be involved in the neuronal degeneration of PD. PINK1 was originally discovered by transcription profiling experiments and is one of several genes that are transcriptionally transactivated by the PTEN gene (9Unoki M. Nakamura Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). PINK1 shows variable levels of expression in different cancer cell types. The PTEN protein acts as a tumor suppressor through direct antagonism of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling (15Sansal I. Sellers W.R. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 2954-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 16Parsons R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). PTEN promotes apoptosis by inhibiting activation of the cell survival kinase Akt in neurons (15Sansal I. Sellers W.R. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 2954-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 16Parsons R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and PTEN overexpression causes increased sensitivity to excitotoxic cell death in hippocampal neurons (17Gary D.S. Mattson M.P. Neuromolecular Med. 2002; 2: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, PINK1, which is up-regulated by PTEN, appears to have an opposite effect on apoptosis. We hypothesize that PINK1 may serve as a feedback modulator of the pro-apoptotic activity of PTEN, although PINK1 might also regulate other genes, proteins, and cell death pathways independently of PTEN. The recent observation of a functional link between PTEN and DJ-1 (18Kim R.H. Peters M. Jang Y. Shi W. Pintilie M. Fletcher G.C. DeLuca C. Liepa J. Zhou L. Snow B. Binari R.C. Manoukian A.S.

Interacting loci have been identified in many organisms1,2,3,4,5. However, the prevalence of interactions6,7,8, and the nucleotide changes underlying them9,10, are largely unknown. Here we search for naturally occurring genetic interactions in a large set of quantitative phenotypes—the levels of all transcripts in a cross between two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae7. For each transcript, we searched for secondary loci interacting with primary QTLs detected by their individual effects. Such locus pairs were estimated to be involved in the inheritance of 57% of transcripts; statistically significant pairs were identified for 225 transcripts. Among these, 67% of secondary loci had individual effects too small to be significant in a genome-wide scan. Engineered polymorphisms in isogenic strains confirmed an interaction between the mating-type locus MAT and the pheromone response gene GPA1. Our results indicate that genetic interactions are widespread in the genetics of transcript levels, and that many QTLs will be missed by single-locus tests but can be detected by two-stage tests that allow for interactions."

Once a cell is activated, IκB is phosphorylated by IκB kinase (IKK) and tagged by ubiquitin for proteasomal degradation, freeing NF-κB to enter the nucleus (2Rothwarf D.M. Karin M. Sci. STKE 1999. 1999; : RE1Google Scholar). Nerve growth factor (NGF) elicits its biological response by binding to two receptors, TrkA and p75. The p75 receptor activates NF-κB by binding and interacting directly with TRAF6 (5Khursigara G. Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. J. Biol.

Both the aPKCs, ζ and ι, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF6) specifically interact with p62; aPKC interacts with the PB1 domain (amino acids 3-100), and TRAF6 interacts with the TRAF6 binding domain (amino acids 228-254) (12Geetha T.

Moscat J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3044-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In this regard, dominant negative aPKC impairs IKKβ activation (16Lallena M.-J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C.

Altogether, these findings suggest a possible role for p62 in the regulation of TRAF6 activation, although the biochemical mechanism whereby p62 regulates TRAF6 remains elusive. In this study, we examine the role of p62 in TRAF6 activation. We find that through polyubiquitin binding to the UBA domain p62 regulates K63-polyubiquitination and oligomerization of TRAF6.

Anti-FLAG antibodies coupled to agarose or not were purchased from Sigma. IKKβ was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and aPKC was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. NGF was obtained from Bioproducts for Science (Indianapolis, IN), and Δ9/13 NGF was provided by Kenneth Neet, Chicago Medical School.

Immunoprecipitation—PC12 cells or HEK cells were transfected and immunoprecipitated in either denaturing SDS-lysis buffer to examine covalent polyubiquitination of TRAF6 or Triton lysis buffer to examine formation coassociation of proteins in the signal complex, as described previously (14Seibenhener M.L.

Assays were conducted in triplicate and normalized to activity obtained with Renilla. Glycerol Gradient Ultracentrifugation—Oligomerization of TRAF6 was conducted employing glycerol gradient centrifugation as described previously (21Ea C. Sun L. Inoue J. Chen Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Centrifugation was performed at 250,000 × g for 6 h, in a SW 60 rotor (Beckman Coulter) and, thereafter, 12 200-ml fractions were collected. Fractions 9-12 (TRAF6 oligomers) were pooled and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and blotted with an antibody to FLAG (detecting TRAF6). Lysates (60 μg) of the transfected cells were Western blotted with FLAG and Myc/HA to detect either TRAF6 or p62. We have previously shown that p62 is necessary for TRAF6-dependent activation of NF-κB in both the IL-1 and NGF systems (7Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Mamidipudi V. Diaz-Meco M.T. Barker P.A. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 8Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Nakano H. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further examine the requirement for each domain of p62 in the NF-κB activation process, deletion constructs of p62, missing the N-terminal PB1 motif, the TRAF6 interaction site, or the UBA domain, were cotransfected into HEK cells, and NF-κB activity was measured by luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 1A). All p62 constructs were expressed (Fig. 1B). Deletion of any one domain of p62 abolished TRAF6-induced NF-κB activity, suggesting that each domain plays a critical non-redundant role in the biochemical mechanism of TRAF6 activation (Fig. 1B). Previous studies have shown that the activity of TRAF6 is regulated by polyubiquitination/activation may be stimulated by endogenous factors (20Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G. Inoue J. Chen Z. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 21Ea C. Sun L. Inoue J. Chen Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15318-15323Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To examine whether p62 regulates TRAF6 by a similar mechanism, HEK cells were cotransfected with p62, TRAF6, and ubiquitin (Fig. 2A). TRAF6 displayed low basal polyubiquitination; however, when cotransfected with p62, TRAF6 polyubiquitination was dramatically enhanced (Fig. 2A). Under stringent SDS-denaturing immunoprecipitation conditions, TRAF6 did not coimmunoprecipitate p62 as shown by lack of p62 in the TRAF6 immunoprecipitate (data not shown). We observe that p62 knock-out mice exhibit reduced NF-κB activity and diminished IKK phosphorylation (22Duran A. Serrano M. Leitges M. Flores J.M. Picard S. Brown J.P. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 303-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To examine whether the loss of p62 affected TRAF6 polyubiquitination, lysates of brain from p62 wild type or knock-out mice were immunoprecipitated for TRAF6, and ubiquitination was examined by Western blotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 2B). The loss of p62 completely eliminated ubiquitination of TRAF6, supporting the cotransfection findings (Fig. 2A). To examine whether p62 stimulated TRAF6 K63-chain synthesis, mutants of Ub K29R, K48R, and K63R were transfected along with TRAF6 and p62. Mutation of K63R but not K29R or K48R completely eliminated TRAF6 polyubiquitination, thereby demonstrating that p62 selectively stimulated K63-polyubiquitin chain synthesis. Since all three interaction domains of p62 were necessary for NF-κB activity (Fig. 1A), we sought to evaluate the role each domain has in TRAF6 polyubiquitination. HEK cells were cotransfected with p62 and its mutants, along with TRAF6 and ubiquitin (Fig. 2D). Deletion of the N terminus, the TRAF6 domain, or the UBA domain of p62 completely prevented p62-stimulated ubiquitination of TRAF6 (Fig. 2D). These findings suggest that p62 dimerization through the N terminus is necessary for p62 to stimulate ubiquitination of TRAF6. Likewise, deletion of the UBA domain blocked p62-stimulated TRAF6 polyubiquitination. This finding suggests that polyubiquitin chains carried by the UBA domain of p62 may be utilized for TRAF6 polyubiquitination. We have shown that amino acids 406-409, MGF, in the UBA domain serve as a hydrophobic core pocket for polyubiquitin chain binding (14Seibenhener M.L. Babu J.R. Geetha T. Wong H.C. Krishna N.R. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8055-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Mutant 1, L398V, has no effect on the polyubiquitin chain binding ability of the UBA domain (14Seibenhener M.L. Babu J.R. Geetha T. Wong H.C. Krishna N.R. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8055-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar); however, mutant 2, F406V, in which a critical residue necessary for chain binding is changed, prevents p62 enhancement of TRAF6 ubiquitination. These findings demonstrate that chain binding by the UBA domain of p62 is necessary for ubiquitination of TRAF6. Recent studies have shown that TRAF6 is activated via a mechanism employing oligomerization (21Ea C. Sun L. Inoue J. Chen Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15318-15323Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To test whether p62 influences TRAF6 oligomerization, lysates from transfected cells were analyzed by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation. Equal concentrations of transfected HEK cell lysate, expressing similar amounts of TRAF6 and/or p62 were loaded onto the gradients. For comparison purposes, fractions 9-12 (TRAF6 oligomers) were immunoprecipitated with FLAG, to capture transfected TRAF6, and then Western blotted for FLAG (Fig. 2E). TRAF6 migrated at the bottom of the gradient as oligomers only when cotransfected with full-length p62. Formation of TRAF6 oligomers was significantly reduced when the cotransfection was conducted with either ΔN-term or ΔUBA constructs of p62 and completely eliminated when TRA6/p62 interaction was blocked. Altogether, these findings suggest that p62 induces TRAF6 oligomerization and polyubiquitination. NGF activation of NF-κB is p62-dependent (7Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Mamidipudi V. Diaz-Meco M.T. Barker P.A. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Since TRAF6 lies upstream in this signal cascade, we hypothesized that NGF might be a natural inducer of TRAF6 polyubiquitination. Furthermore, NGF/NF-κB activation occurs primarily through the p75 receptor, and this response is attenuated by TrkA receptor activation (6Mamidipudi V. Li X. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28010-28018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, PC12 cells were stimulated with NGF Δ9/13, which selectively activates p75 neurotrophin signaling (23Hughes A.L. Messineo-Jones D. Leed S.P. Neet K.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 63: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), resulting in potent stimulation of TRAF6 polyubiquitination (Fig. 3A). To examine the requirement for p62 and its interaction domains in this process, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with various p62 constructs, stimulated with NGF Δ9/13, followed by immunoprecipitation of TRAF6 and Western blotted with ubiquitin. Acting as dominant negative, deletion of p62 N-term, TRAF6, or UBA domains completely blocked ligand-stimulated polyubiquitination of TRAF6 (Fig. 3B), as well as NGF-induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 3C). Altogether, these findings underscore the critical and important role that p62 plays as a regulator in neurotrophin-mediated activation of TRAF6. To examine the formation of the endogenous signal complex, PC12 cells were treated with Δ9/13 NGF over the course of the same time period used for the study of TRAF6 polyubiquitination (Fig. 3A). NGF treatment leads to transient formation of a p62 complex that consisted of IKKβ, aPKCι, and TRAF6 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, IKKβ, aPKCι and TRAF6 were recruited simultaneously into the signal complex. To determine whether TRAF6 interaction with p62 was necessary for formation of the signal complex and activation of the NF-κB pathway, we used an inhibitory peptide that blocks p62-TRAF6 binding (14Seibenhener M.L. Babu J.R. Geetha T. Wong H.C. Krishna N.R. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8055-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The p62 sequence has a TRAF6 binding site, amino acids 228-254, and peptides to the core sequence (PSEDPS) have been shown to block TRAF6 signaling (24Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenue O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Both control and inhibitory TRAF6 peptides were synthesized with a leader sequence added to impart cell permeability. PC12 cells were then treated with peptide for 5 h prior to stimulation with Δ9/13 NGF and immunoprecipitation of TRAF6. Treatment with the inhibitory peptide blocked NGF-induced TRAF6 polyubiquitination (Fig. 4B). The inhibitory peptide provided a tool to assess which proteins were recruited into the signal complex in a TRAF6 polyubiquitin chain-dependent manner. Therefore, interactions between p62 and components of the signal complex in the presence or absence of peptide were also examined (Fig. 4B). In addition to blocking polyubiquitination of TRAF6 (Fig. 4B), the inhibitory peptide blocked interaction of p62/TRAF6, recruitment of IKKβ and aPKC, and inhibited NF-κB activation, as assessed by lack of IκB phosphorylation in the lysates. Collectively, these results reveal that TRAF6 interaction with p62 leads to TRAF6 activation along with formation of a TRAF6 signal complex consisting of p62-TRAF6-IKKβ-aPKC. Mutations in the UBA domain of Sequestosome 1/p62 have been recently liked to familial PDB (15Hocking L.J. Lucas G. Daroszewska A. Cundy T. Nicholson G. Donath J. Walsh J. Finlayson C. Cavey J. Ciani B. Sheppard P. Searle M. Layfield R. Ralston S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 1122-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Several types of mutations have been observed: 1) those that affect polyubiquitin binding, such as those of the hydrophobic surface patch involved in ubiquitin interaction, 2) mutations which encode premature stop codon(s) that produce a protein lacking a UBA domain, or 3) mutations that do not affect polyubiquitin chain binding. Our findings reveal that mutations that are within the hydrophobic surface patch are likely to affect NF-κB activation, since chain binding is necessary for TRAF6 activation. Likewise, deletion of the UBA domain results in a loss of function phenotype. On the other hand, mutations that have no effect on polyubiquitin chain binding may result in a gain of function phenotype. If so, this would be in keeping with our observation that the P392L Pagetic mutation results in hyperactivation of the NF-κB pathway (22Duran A. Serrano M. Leitges M. Flores J.M. Picard S. Brown J.P. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 303-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Also, since p62 serves not only as a scaffold for TRAF6, but as a receptor for polyubiquitinated proteins (14Seibenhener M.L. Babu J.R. Geetha T. Wong H.C. Krishna N.R. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8055-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), it is possible that different Pagetic mutants may affect various other pathways through the proteins that are recruited to the UBA domain. Clearly, further studies will be needed to assess the relationship between genotype and phenotype and the biochemical function of p62 in relation to PDB. Previous studies have shown that TAB2 can enhance TRAF6 polyubiqutination through ubiquitin binding (20Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G. Inoue J. Chen Z. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 21Ea C. Sun L. Inoue J. Chen Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15318-15323Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, BARD1 can stimulate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of BRCA1 some 20-fold (25Mallery D. Vandenberg C. Hiom K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6755-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 26Badciong J. Haas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49668-49675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Likewise, activity of the RING Ub ligase, Mdm2, can be enhanced though interaction with MdmX (27Xia Y. Pao G.M. Chen H. Verma I. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5255-5263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, interaction of E3 ligases with their respective scaffold may serve as a conserved mechanism for their activation. There likely exist discrete sites for assembly of E3 signaling complexes within the cell. In this regard, we observed sites of punctate TRAF6/p62 colocalization in HEK cells treated with IL-1 (8Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Nakano H. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or PC12 cells treated with NGF (28Samuels I. Seibenhener M.L. Neidigh K. Wooten M.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ability of p62 to recruit TRAF6 to these sites is dependent upon interaction of TRAF6 with p62 (8Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Nakano H. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or a functional UBA domain (14Seibenhener M.L. Babu J.R. Geetha T. Wong H.C. Krishna N.R. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8055-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although p62-UBA domain non-selectively binds K48 and K63 ubiquitin chains (29Rassi S. Varadan R. Fushman D. Pickart C.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 8: 708-714Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar), p62 selectively stimulates K63-polyubiquitination chain synthesis as a function of interaction with the E3, TRAF6. These findings suggest the scaffolding function of p62 may regulate K63-polyubiquitination of target substrates brought into the p62/TRAF6 complex. Moreover, since loss of p62 interaction/dimerization influences TRAF6 K63-polyubiquitination, binding of TRAF6 to p62 probably induces a p62 conformation that enables chain binding by the UBA domain. Further structural studies will be needed to directly test this idea. Activation of IKK through the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 kinase complex requires polyubiqutination of TRAF6 (21Ea C. Sun L. Inoue J. Chen Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15318-15323Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Sun L. Deng L. Ea C. Xia Z. Chen Z. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Both TAB1 and TAB2 bind K63-polyubiquitin chains leading to the activation of TAK1 and subsequent phosphorylation of IKKβ in the activation loop (20Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G. Inoue J. Chen Z. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). We propose that this activation scenario may be conserved and that p62 recruits TRAF6 and activates aPKCiota/zeta, to initiate the signaling cascade with phosphorylation of IKKβ by aPKC (16Lallena M.-J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This would be in keeping with the observation that removal of p62 inhibits IKKβ phosphorylation and activation by NGF (7Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Mamidipudi V. Diaz-Meco M.T. Barker P.A. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and our findings herein demonstrating that removal of p62 and its interaction domains, or TRAF6/p62 interaction, blocks TRAF6 polyubiquitination and impairs formation of the NF-κB-signal complex and activation of NF-κB. Interestingly, Ajuba has recently been identified as a novel protein that recruits TRAF6 to p62 and may stabilize the interaction of these two proteins influencing activation of aPKC (31Feng Y. Longmore G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4010-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Constitutive NF-κB activity is necessary for neuronal survival (3Bhakar A.L. Tannis L.L. Zeindler C. Russo M.P. Jobin C. Park D.S. MacPherson S. Barker P.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8465-8475Crossref Google Scholar). We are currently characterizing the neuronal pheonotype of the p62 knock-out mice and observe significant neurodegeneration 3J. R. Babu, M. L. Seibenhener, T. Geetha, M. C. Wooten, D. A. Boyett, N. Cox, J. Peng, M. T. Diaz-Meco, J. Moscat, and M. W. Wooten, manuscript in preparation. . Two naturally occurring isoforms of p62 are known: one lacks a TRAF6 binding site (32Gong J. Xu J. Bezanilla M. van Huizen R. Derin R. Li M. Science. 1999; 285: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and another lacks a UBA domain (33Croci C. Brandstatter J.H. Enz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6128-6135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, p62 may regulate TRAF6 activation in a tissue and context-specific manner depending upon the expression of various p62 isoforms."

It has been suggested that nearly all biochemical processes are performed by protein complexes (1Alberts B. Cell. 1998; 92: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). This is particularly true in cellular membranes, where many well characterized proteins assemble into complexes that carry out important tasks in energy generation, protein trafficking, and small molecule transport. Many uncharacterized proteins (“orphans”) are also predicted to be localized in cell membranes (2Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L.L. J. Mol.

Identifying the interacting partners of these proteins is critical to understanding their function.

BN-PAGE is also an attractive proteomic solution for basic expression profiling and can be used to complement traditional two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, since it does not discriminate against membrane proteins. In this study, we have optimized the BN-PAGE methodology for the analysis of protein complexes in the Escherichia coli cell envelope. The E. coli cell envelope is an ideal model system for membrane protein studies as it contains a diverse array of biochemical functions, many of which are analogous to those found in more specialized membranes in eukaryotic organisms and pathogenic prokaryotes. However, despite being extensively studied as a model system, 36% of α-helical proteins in the inner membrane and many β-barrel proteins of the outer membrane remain orphans (3Daley D.O. Rapp M. Granseth E. Melen K. Drew D. von Heijne G. Science. 2005; 308: 1321-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 27Wimley W.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We report the identification of a large number of protein complexes, suggest oligomeric state and possible functions for a number of orphan proteins and provide reference two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE maps for both the outer and inner membranes. Preparation of Membrane Vesicles—The E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (F– ompT hsdSB (rB– mB–) gal dcm (DE3) pLysS) was grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani broth. Cells were harvested at late log phase by centrifugation at 9,300 × g. Inner and outer membrane vesicles (IMVs and OMVs) were separated as described previously (28de Vrije T. Tommasson J. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 900: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Following the removal of cell debris, the membrane fraction was layered on a two-step sucrose gradient (8.8:55% (w/v) sucrose) and centrifuged at 210,000 × g for 2.5 h. The membrane fraction was removed, and IMVs and OMVs were separated on a six-step sucrose gradient as described previously (28de Vrije T. Tommasson J. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 900: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were resuspended in ACA750 buffer (750 mm n-aminocaproic acid, 50 mm Bis-Tris, 0.5 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.0) and stored at –80 °C. Protein content was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). One-dimensional BN-PAGE—Approximately 100 μg of protein was used for each lane of the BN-PAGE. Protein complexes were solubilized at 4 °C for 20 min, in ACA750 buffer containing varying amounts of detergent. We trialed Triton X-100, n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM), and digitonin at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 1.5% (w/v). Solubilization with 0.5% (w/v) DDM was determined to be the most effective, as evidenced by the number of complexes in the BN gel, their intensity, and their molecular mass range. Although solubilization with Triton X-100 and digitonin appeared to perform similarly for some complexes, the overall picture obtained was not as comprehensive as when DDM was used, and we decided not to optimize further with these detergents. Subsequent experiments were therefore performed using 0.5% (w/v) DDM. Following solubilization, samples were cleared by centrifugation at 264,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to 15 μl of G250 solution (5% (w/v) Coomassie G250 in ACA750 buffer) and loaded onto the gel. BN-PAGE was performed in a Hoefer SE-600 using a 4% stacking and a 5–15% separating gel (gel dimensions 14 cm × 16 cm × 1.5 mm). Buffers and gel compositions used were essentially prepared as described previously (16Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, 18Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.-P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), with a few modifications. The gel buffer contained 250 mm n-aminocaproic acid, 25 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0; the cathode buffer contained 50 mm Tricine, 15 mm Bis-Tris, 0.05% (w/v) Coomassie G250, 0.03% (w/v) DDM, pH 7.0; and the anode buffer contained 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0. BN-polyacrylamide gels were destained (10% (v/v) acetic acid, 30% (v/v) methanol) and cut into lanes for use in the two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. High molecular mass markers were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Sweden). The highest molecular mass band was corrected to be 880 kDa (29Agne B. Meindl N. Neiderhoff K. Einwachter H. Rehling P. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Girzalsky W. Kunau W.-H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE—Gel strips obtained from the one-dimensional BN-PAGE were soaked for 20 min in equilibration buffer (2% (w/v) SDS, 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). SDS-PAGE was performed in a Hoefer SE-600 using a 4% stacking and a 8–16% separating gel (gel dimensions 14 cm × 20 cm × 1.5 mm) according to standard protocols. Gels were stained with Coomassie (10% (v/v) acetic acid, 45% (v/v) methanol, 0.25% (w/v) Coomassie R250) or silver (30Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar), and protein spots were detected using the PDQuest software (Bio-Rad). Western Blotting—Prior to transfer, SDS gels were soaked for 40 min in transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.037% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) methanol). Proteins were transferred to Protran® Nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) by electrophoresis at 15 V for 60 min using a Transfer-Blot Semidry Transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Detection was performed using a Fuji LAS 1000-Plus CCD camera and the ECL Advance Western blot developing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Mass Spectrometry—Protein spots from SDS gels were excised manually. In-gel trypsin digestion was carried out according to Shevchenko et al. (31Shevchenko A. Chernushevich I. Wilm M. Mann M. Chapman J.R. Mass Spectrometry of Proteins and Peptides. 146. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 1-16Google Scholar). Extracted peptides were mixed 1:1 with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (5 mg/ml) in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and left to air-dry after spotting on the MALDI target. MALDI-TOF analysis was performed on a Voyager-ED STR (Applied Biosystems), mass spectrometer. External calibration was done using the Sequazyme Peptide Mass Standards Kit (Applied Biosystems) and internal calibration based on trypsin autodigestion peaks when available (842.5094 and 2,211.1046 Da). Samples that could not be identified through fingerprinting were sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using the 4700 Proteomics analyzer equipped with TOF/TOF optics (Applied Biosystems). MS/MS analyses were carried out with air as collision gas using 1-kV collision energy, which is defined by the potential difference between the source acceleration voltage (8 kV) and the floating collision cell (7 kV). Mass spectra were analyzed using the Data Explorer and GPS Explorer software, and peptide masses were searched against the E. coli data base in SwissProt, using the Mascot search engine (available on the World Wide Web at www.matrixscience.com). Search parameters allowed for a mass accuracy of ±100 ppm, one missed cleavage of trypsin, oxidation of methionine, and carbamido-methylation of cysteine. All identified proteins were size-checked against the protein spot on the SDS gel. Abberant migration caused by hydrophobicity (32Rais I. Karas M. Schägger H. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 2567-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and predicted signal peptides was taken into account when considering molecular masses. Predictions—Topology predictions were performed using the TMHMM predictor (available on the World Wide Web at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/), and signal peptide predictions using SignalP 3.0 (available on the World Wide Web at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). In a first step, inner and outer membrane vesicles (IMVs and OMVs) were purified from E. coli using a six-step sucrose gradient (28de Vrije T. Tommasson J. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 900: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Immunodecoration with marker antibodies indicated that there was only minor cross-contamination between the different fractions (data not shown). Purification of protein complexes in an intact form (i.e. complete with all peripherally associated proteins) is largely dependent on the solubilization conditions used and can differ for various complexes. We sought to obtain a set of generic conditions that would be suitable for a large number of membrane protein complexes when resolved by BN-PAGE. By screening three commonly used detergents at different concentrations (see “Materials and Methods”), we were able to decide on a protocol using DDM, Fig. 1. This protocol resolved a large number of complexes from both the IMVs and OMVs in the molecular mass range from ∼60 to >1,000 kDa. To identify the individual proteins in each complex, the one-dimensional BN gels were analyzed in the second dimension by SDS-PAGE, Fig. 2. Complexes were consequently resolved into vertical “channels,” enabling visualization of the individual constituents. Proteins that had formed a complex in the BN gel, were identified by drawing a vertical line through the gel, and had a similar shape in the SDS gel (as a result of co-migration in the BN gel). The second dimension SDS-PAGE also enabled us to detect less abundant complexes that were hidden in the one-dimensional BN gel. Using the PDQuest two-dimensional analysis software on Coomassie- and silver-stained gels, we could detect 115 protein spots in the IMV gel and 62 protein spots in the OMV gel.FIGURE 2BN/SDS-PAGE separation of membrane protein complexes from inner (A) and outer (B) membrane vesicles. Commercially available molecular mass markers for the BN-PAGE are indicated at the top, and mass markers for the SDS-PAGE are shown to the right. Proteins identified by mass spectrometry are indicated. Gels have been stained with Coomassie. The YfgL protein was inferred from its position in the gel and is marked with an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We were able to identify 44 proteins from the IMVs: 35 by MALDI-TOF, an additional seven by MALDI-TOF/TOF, and two using available antibodies (Fig. 2A and TABLE ONE). 55% of the identified proteins were predicted by TMHMM (2Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar) to be α-helical membrane proteins: 18 proteins with at least two transmembrane helices (TMHs) and six proteins with one TMH. All peptides identified were from the soluble domains of the membrane proteins. A further 34% of the identified proteins corresponded to soluble components of membrane protein complexes. In total, these proteins represent 34 distinct inner membrane protein complexes (see below). Five soluble proteins were also identified (11%), which may be peripherally associated with the membrane fractions or minor contamination.TABLE ONEProteins identified by mass spectrometry from inner membrane vesicles Protein Swissprot no.

This is not surprising, since E. coli possesses a large, modular respiratory chain consisting of 15 primary dehydrogenases and 10 terminal reductases/oxidases (reviewed in Ref. 33Unden G. Bongaerts J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). We were able to identify two terminal oxidases, three primary dehydrogenases, and the F1-F0-ATP synthase. All but one of these known complexes resolved intact in the gels and are described in detail below. Succinate dehydrogenase is a known heterotetramer, SdhABCD, which trimerizes to form a functional complex with a predicted molecular mass of 355 kDa (34Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). From the SDS gel, we could identify the 66-kDa flavoprotein subunit (SdhA) and the 26-kDa iron-sulfur protein (SdhB) (Fig. 3A). Two other unidentified proteins that correspond in molecular mass to that predicted for SdhC (14 kDa) and SdhD (15 kDa) were also detected in the same channel. Based on the size of the succinate dehydrogenase complex in the BN gel (Fig. 1A) and the fact that all four constituent proteins were present in the SDS gel, we conclude that the (SdhABCD)3 complex is intact. The cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase is also a known heterotetrameric complex, CyoABCD, with a predicted molecular mass of 145 kDa (35Abrahamson J. Riistama S. Larsson G. Jassaitis A. Svensson-Ek M. Laakkonen L. Puustinen A. Iwata S. Wikstrom M. Nature. 2000; 7: 910-917Google Scholar). In the SDS gel, we could identify CyoA (35 kDa) (Fig. 3B). Three other proteins in the same channel could not be identified, but their molecular masses correspond to that predicted for CyoB (apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa/predicted molecular mass 74 kDa), CyoC (22 kDa) and CyoD (12 kDa). Again, based on the size of the complex in the BN gel (Fig. 1A) and the fact that all four constituent proteins were present in the SDS gel, we conclude that the cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase is intact. Glucose dehydrogenase (Gdh) is a monomeric protein with five transmembrane segments (36Yamada M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12812-12817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although not in an oligomeric complex, we could identify the Gdh monomer at the predicted molecular mass of 85 kDa in both the BN and SDS gels (Fig. 2A). Accurate molecular mass determination of membrane protein complexes using BN-PAGE is possible if the mass of extra Coomassie and detergent is taken into account (37Heuberger E. Veenhoff L. Duurkens R. Friessen R. Poolman B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We used the SdhABCD, Cyo-ABCD, and Gdh proteins to generate a standard curve that could be used to estimate the molecular mass of other membrane protein complexes. This standard curve more accurately reflected the predicted molecular mass of membrane protein complexes than commercial markers generated from soluble proteins (supplemental Fig. 1A). In addition to the cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase, we also detected the cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase. This complex is reported to be a heterodimer, CydAB, with a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa (38Miller M.J. Hermodson M. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5235-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we identified CydA (58 kDa) and CydB (42 kDa) along with a third protein, YhcB (15 kDa), in a complex with an estimated molecular mass of ∼118 kDa (Fig. 3B). YhcB therefore appears to be a hitherto unidentified subunit of the cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase. The NADH dehydrogenase was also identified but was unfortunately fragmented by our solubilization conditions. This is not surprising, since it has a pronounced detergent susceptibili"
https://openalex.org/W2012915046,"Supermassive black holes underwent periods of exponential growth during which we see them as quasars in the distant Universe. The summed emission from these quasars generates the cosmic X-ray background, the spectrum of which has been used to argue that most black-hole growth is obscured. There are clear examples of obscured black-hole growth in the form of 'type-2' quasars, but their numbers are fewer than expected from modelling of the X-ray background. Here we report the direct detection of a population of distant type-2 quasars, which is at least comparable in size to the well-known unobscured type-1 population. We selected objects that have mid-infrared and radio emissions characteristic of quasars, but which are faint at near-infrared and optical wavelengths. We conclude that this population is responsible for most of the black-hole growth in the young Universe and that, throughout cosmic history, black-hole growth occurs in the dusty, gas-rich centres of active galaxies."

https://openalex.org/W2093211347,"Abstract Catalase is a highly conserved heme-containing antioxidant enzyme known for its ability to degrade hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. In low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, the enzyme also exhibits peroxidase activity. We report that mammalian catalase also possesses oxidase activity. This activity, which is detected in purified catalases, cell lysates, and intact cells, requires oxygen and utilizes electron donor substrates in the absence of hydrogen peroxide or any added cofactors. Using purified bovine catalase and 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine as the substrate, the oxidase activity was found to be temperature-dependent and displays a pH optimum of 7–9. The Km for the substrate is 2.4 × 10-4 m, and Vmax is 4.7 × 10-5 m/s. Endogenous substrates, including the tryptophan precursor indole, the neurotransmitter precursor β-phenylethylamine, and a variety of peroxidase and laccase substrates, as well as carcinogenic benzidines, were found to be oxidized by catalase or to inhibit this activity. Several dietary plant micronutrients that inhibit carcinogenesis, including indole-3-carbinol, indole-3-carboxaldehyde, ferulic acid, vanillic acid, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate, were effective inhibitors of the activity of catalase oxidase. Difference spectroscopy revealed that catalase oxidase/substrate interactions involve the heme-iron; the resulting spectra show time-dependent decreases in the ferric heme of the enzyme with corresponding increases in the formation of an oxyferryl intermediate, potentially reflecting a compound II-like intermediate. These data suggest a mechanism of oxidase activity involving the formation of an oxygen-bound, substrate-facilitated reductive intermediate. Our results describe a novel function for catalase potentially important in metabolism of endogenous substrates and in the action of carcinogens and chemopreventative agents."
https://openalex.org/W2007872436,"Steroids that activate glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and mineralocorticoid receptors have important regulatory effects on neural development, plasticity, and the body's stress response. Here, we investigated the role of corticosteroids in regulating the expression of the glial glutamate transporters glial glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) and glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) in rat primary astrocytes. The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone provoked a marked increase of GLT-1 transcription and protein levels in cortical astrocytes, whereas GLAST expression remained unaffected. Up-regulation of GLT-1 expression was accompanied by an enhanced glutamate uptake, which could be blocked by the specific GLT-1 inhibitor dihydrokainate. The promoting effect of dexamethasone on GLT-1 gene expression and function was abolished by the GR antagonist mifepristone. A predominant role of the GR was further supported by the observation that corticosterone could elevate GLT-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas aldosterone, the physiological ligand of the mineralocorticoid receptor, exerted only weak effects even when applied at high concentrations. Moreover, we monitored brain region-specific differences, since all corticosteroids used in this study failed to alter the expression of GLT-1 in midbrain and cerebellar glia, although expression levels of both corticosteroid receptor subtypes were similar in all brain regions analyzed. Dexamethasone, however, modestly enhanced GLT-1 expression in cerebellar glia in combination with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, suggesting that suppression of GLT-1 expression in cerebellar cultures may at least in part be epigenetically mediated by a DNA methylation-dependent process. Taken together, our data highlight a potential role for glucocorticoids in regulating GLT-1 gene expression during central nervous system development or pathophysiogical processes including stress."
https://openalex.org/W2162222999,"Aggregation of proteins into insoluble deposits is associated with a variety of human diseases. In Alzheimer disease, the aggregation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides is believed to play a key role in pathogenesis. Although the 40-mer (Aβ40) is produced in vivo at higher levels than the 42-mer (Aβ42), senile plaque in diseased brains is composed primarily of Aβ42. Likewise, in vitro, Aβ42 forms fibrils more rapidly than Aβ40. The enhanced amyloidogenicity of Aβ42 could be due simply to its greater length. Alternatively, specific properties of residues Ile41 and Ala42 might favor aggregation. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we constructed a library of sequences in which residues 41 and 42 were randomized. The aggregation behavior of the resulting sequences was assessed using a high throughput screen, based on the finding that fusions of Aβ42 to green fluorescence protein (GFP) prevent the folding and fluorescence of GFP, whereas mutations in Aβ42 that disrupt aggregation produce green fluorescent fusions. Correlations between the sequences of Aβ42 mutants and the fluorescence of Aβ42-GFP fusions in vivo were confirmed in vitro through biophysical studies of synthetic 42-residue peptides. The data reveal a strong correlation between aggregation propensity and the hydrophobicity and β-sheet propensities of residues at positions 41 and 42. Moreover, several mutants containing hydrophilic residues and/or β-sheet breakers at positions 41 and/or 42 were less prone to aggregate than Aβ40 wherein these two residues are deleted entirely. Thus, properties of the side chains at positions 41 and 42, rather than length per se, cause Aβ42 to aggregate more readily than Aβ40. Aggregation of proteins into insoluble deposits is associated with a variety of human diseases. In Alzheimer disease, the aggregation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides is believed to play a key role in pathogenesis. Although the 40-mer (Aβ40) is produced in vivo at higher levels than the 42-mer (Aβ42), senile plaque in diseased brains is composed primarily of Aβ42. Likewise, in vitro, Aβ42 forms fibrils more rapidly than Aβ40. The enhanced amyloidogenicity of Aβ42 could be due simply to its greater length. Alternatively, specific properties of residues Ile41 and Ala42 might favor aggregation.

Thus, properties of the side chains at positions 41 and 42, rather than length per se, cause Aβ42 to aggregate more readily than Aβ40. The deposition of insoluble proteins into amyloid plaque is associated with various diseases including Alzheimer disease, prion encephalopathies, Parkinson disease, and Huntington disease (1Koo E.H.

Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). Because of inhomogeneous cleavage by γ secretase, Aβ peptides range in length from 39 to 43 residues. Among these peptides, the 40-mer (Aβ40) and the 42-mer (Aβ42) are abundant in diseased brains (12Kuo Y. Emmerling M.R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Kasunic T.C. Kirkpatrick J.B. Murdoch G.H. Ball M.J. Roher A.E.

Despite their 95% sequence identity, Aβ40 and Aβ42 display dramatically different behaviors both in vivo and in vitro. Biochemical and immunocytochemical studies show that although Aβ40 is major component in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, senile amyloid plaques formed in vivo are composed primarily of Aβ42 (5Selkoe D.

Moreover, although both peptides aggregate into fibrils in vitro, Aβ42 does so more rapidly than Aβ40. Concentrated solutions of Aβ40 are stable for days, whereas comparable solutions of Aβ42 aggregate almost immediately (17Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar, 18Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). Not only is Aβ42 more prone to aggregate than Aβ40, but the pathways toward aggregation are also different. Recently, Teplow and coworkers (19Bitan G. Kirkitadze M. Lomakin A. Vollers S. Benedek G. Teplow D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 20Bitan G. Vollers S. Teplow D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34882-34889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) found that carefully prepared aggregate-free Aβ40 occurs as monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers in rapid equilibrium. In contrast, Aβ42 preferentially forms pentamer/hexamer units (paranuclei) that assembled further into beaded superstructures similar to early protofibrils. The different aggregation behaviors of Aβ40 and Aβ42 led us to question the role of the two C-terminal residues, Ile41 and Ala42. Is it simply the increased length of Aβ42 that causes its increased amyloidogenicity? Or are particular features of the Ile41 and Ala42 side chains important for amyloid formation? To address these questions, we performed random mutagenesis on positions 41 and 42. The change in aggregation behavior resulting from the mutations was monitored by using fusions of the Aβ42 variants to GFP. Fluorescence of these fusions is inversely correlated with the propensity of the fused Aβ mutant sequence to aggregate (21Wurth C. Guimard N.K. Hecht M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); GFP fused to wild type Aβ42 does not fluorescence, whereas fusions to less aggregating mutants display increased fluorescence. By correlating the observed levels of fluorescence with the identities of the side chains at positions 41 and 42, we determined the side chain properties at these positions that are responsible for the enhanced aggregation of Aβ42 relative to Aβ40. Construction of Libraries of Aβ42-GFP Fusions—Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), and restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Mutations were incorporated into a synthetic Aβ42 gene (21Wurth C. Guimard N.K. Hecht M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) by PCR using DeepVent polymerase (New England Biolabs) and an Ericomp Easycycler™ Twinblock thermocycler. After PCR, the mutagenized Aβ42 gene inserts and the pET 28 vector containing the GFP gene (21Wurth C. Guimard N.K. Hecht M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) were doubly digested with BamHI and NdeI. The digested insert and vector were then ligated together using T4 ligase. Plasmids were transformed into the XL1-Blue strain of Escherichia coli (Stratagene) and plated for overnight growth on plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The primer for random mutagenesis at position 41 and 42 had the following sequence: 5′-TCTTCTGGATCCNNNNNNCACCACGCCGCCCACCAT-3′. The primer for mutagenesis encoding a combinatorial mix of polar residues used the degenerate codon NAN. For a combinatorial mix of hydrophobic residues we used the degenerate codon NTN (where N denotes a mixture of A, G, C, and T). Screening of Green/White Phenotype—DNA libraries were isolated from E. coli strain XL1-Blue, transformed into BL21(DE3) (23Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar), and plated onto nitrocellulose paper (Millipore NC-HATF 83 mm) on LB plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Following overnight growth at 37 °C, the nitrocellulose papers were transferred to LB plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated at 30 °C for 4 h to induce the expression of the Aβ-GFP fusion protein. Colonies were counted and the green/white phenotype was recorded (21Wurth C. Guimard N.K. Hecht M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements—To enable measurement of the fluorescence of the Aβ42-GFP fusions in vivo, colonies were picked, and cultures were grown in LB liquid media containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. When cultures reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.8, expression was induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for an additional 5 h 30 min at 30 °C. After induction, cultures were diluted in Tris-buffered saline to an A600 nm of 0.15. Fluorescence was measured using a 50B spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 510 nm. Expression of Aβ42-GFP fusions was assessed by removing 200 μl of cell culture and analyzing the whole cell content by SDS-PAGE. Correlation of Fluorescence with Biophysical Properties—The fluorescence of the Aβ42-GFP fusions in vivo was plotted against the sum of hydrophobicities or against the sum of the β-sheet propensities at positions 41 and 42. Hydrophobicities were based on the scale of Kyte and Doolittle (24Kyte K. Doolittle R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar), and β-sheet propensities were based on the scale of Minor and Kim (25Minor Jr., D. Kim P. Nature. 1994; 367: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In a further analysis, fluorescence was plotted against the predicted aggregation rates using Equation 1 as developed by Chiti et al. (26Chiti F. Stefani M. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 424: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). ln(νmut/νwt)=AΔHydr+B(ΔΔGcoil−α+ΔΔGβ−coil)+CΔCharge(Eq.1) In Equation 1, νmut and νwt are the aggregation rates of the mutant and wild type sequences, respectively; ΔHydr is the difference in hydrophobicity, and (ΔΔGcoil-α +ΔΔGβ-coil) is the difference in the propensity to convert from α-helix to β-sheet. (Note, the two ΔΔs are added rather than subtracted. This is because subtraction is already accomplished by the definition of the terms. In the first term α is subtracted from coil, and in the second term coil is subtracted from β.) ΔCharge is the difference in charge, and A, B, and C are empirically determined constants. Synthetic 42-Residue Peptides—Crude peptides were purchased from the Keck Institute, Yale University, and were then purified using reverse phase HPLC. Their identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry, and purity was assessed by analytical reverse phase HPLC. The purities of the peptides were greater than 92%. After purification, peptides were lyophilized and dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). HFIP was removed by blowing argon over the sample. Samples were then dissolved in 100 μl of Me2SO/500 μl of 4 m NaOH. Concentrations were determined using the extinction coefficient of tyrosine. Aggregation of Mutant Peptides in Vitro—Peptides were dissolved at a concentration of 10 μm in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 (pH 7.3-7.4). Following incubation at 30 °C for 1 day, samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 60,000 × g. Half of the supernatant was removed and loaded onto reverse phase HPLC to quantify the monomer remaining in solution. To correlate peak size with concentration, a series of standards was run using a range of concentrations of the Asp41-Gln42 mutant. The relationship between peak size and peptide concentration was confirmed using same concentrations of wild type Aβ42, the hydrophobic mutant Leu41-Leu42, and the green control mutant Ser19-Pro34. Thioflavin T Assay—Because the kinetics of fibril formation can be affected by small quantities of seeds, preexisting seeds were removed by the following treatment (27Jao S. Ma K. Talafous J. Orlando R. Zagorski M.G. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Investig. 1997; 4: 240-252Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Lyophilized peptides were dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid at ∼1 mg/ml and sonicated for 15 min. Trifluoroacetic acid was then removed by blowing argon over the sample. The dry sample was resuspended in 2 ml of HFIP. An aliquot corresponding to 0.5 mg of peptide was dried under argon and then dissolved in 300 μl of Me2SO and mixed with 5 ml of 8 mm NaOH. The solution was then centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min to remove any insoluble material. The supernatant was removed, and phosphate-buffered saline was added to a final concentration of 50 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3. The pH was adjusted to 7.4-7.5 with 200 mm formic acid. 500-μl aliquots were removed every 30 min and mixed with 2.4 ml of a ThT solution (7 μm thioflavin T, 50 mm glycine-NaOH (pH 8.5)). Fluorescence was measured with excitation at 450 nm, and emission at 490 nm. A High Throughput Screen for Aβ Aggregation—Random mutagenesis of position 41 and 42 can produce 400 possible sequences (including wild type). Synthesis, purification, and characterization of the aggregation behavior of all 400 peptides would be laborious and extremely expensive, particularly because the Aβ42 peptide is notoriously difficult to synthesize and purify (28Murakami K. Irie K. Morimoto A. Ohigashi H. Shindo M. Nagao M. Shimizu T. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we developed a high throughput screen using GFP as a reporter tag (21Wurth C. Guimard N.K. Hecht M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The folding of GFP and the formation of its active chromaphore occur relatively slowly (30Cubitt A. Heim R. Adams S. Boyd A. Gross L. Tsien R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 448-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Therefore, peptides or proteins fused to the N terminus of GFP can have a dramatic impact on fluorescence. Sequences that aggregate rapidly prevent formation of a correctly folded fluorescent GFP. In contrast, sequences that are soluble or aggregate slowly allow GFP to fold into its native fluorescent structure. In a systematic study using 20 different test proteins, Waldo et al. (31Waldo G.S. Standish B.M. Berendzen J. Terwilliger T.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the fluorescence of E. coli cells expressing fusions to the N terminus of GFP correlated with the solubility of the test protein expressed alone. We have shown previously that the fluorescence of Aβ42-GFP fusions can be used as an unbiased screen for the sequence determinants of Aβ amyloidogenesis (21Wurth C. Guimard N.K. Hecht M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Colonies of E. coli expressing fusions to wild type Aβ42 or to mutants of Aβ42 that favor rapid aggregation are white. In contrast, colonies expressing fusions to soluble (or slowly aggregating) mutants of Aβ42 are green. Here we used Aβ42-GFP fusions to monitor the phenotypic variation resulting from amino acid substitutions at positions 41 and 42 of Aβ42. This enabled a high throughput screen in which more than 2500 colonies could be screened per plate. To ensure that the screen had sufficient dynamic range to distinguish a range of phenotypes, we first performed pilot experiments using fusions of GFP to the wild type sequences of either Aβ42 or Aβ40. (The latter construct can be considered as the null mutant in which residues 41 and 42 are not merely substituted but deleted entirely.) At 37 °C both fusions produced white colonies. Thus, at this temperature, the screen does not have sufficient dynamic range. In contrast, at 30 °C, colonies expressing fusions to Aβ42 were white, whereas those expressing fusions to Aβ40 were green. Thus, at this lower temperature, where expression and subsequent aggregation are slower, the difference in aggregation propensity between Aβ40 and Aβ42 is easily distinguished. Further pilot experiments showed that at 37 °C, virtually all mutations at positions 41 and 42 produced white colonies, whereas at 30 °C libraries of mutants at 41 and 42 produced both green and white colonies. Because expression at 30 °C provided excellent dynamic range, all further experiments were performed at this temperature. A Random Library of Mutants at Positions 41 and 42—A library of random mutants at positions 41 and 42 of Aβ42 was constructed using synthetic oligonucleotides to incorporate random bases (NNN) at the final 2 codons of a synthetic gene encoding Aβ42 (see “Materials and Methods”). The library of mutant genes of Aβ42 was then fused to the 5′ end of a gene encoding GFP. In this construct, the Aβ42 sequence is separated from GFP by a 12-residue linker encoding the sequence Gly-Ser-Ala-Gly-Ser-Ala-Ala-Gly-Ser-Gly-Glu-Phe (31Waldo G.S. Standish B.M. Berendzen J. Terwilliger T.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The library of fusions was then transformed into XL1 Blue cells. Transformation yielded more than 5000 colonies. Because there are only 400 possible combinations of amino acids positions 41 and 42, this library is adequate to sample all (or nearly all) of the possible sequences (TABLE ONE). The library was then extracted from XL1 Blue cells and transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression and high throughput screening.TABLE ONEDiversity of the libraries Random at both 41, 42 Hydrophilic at both 41,42 Hydrophobic at both 41,42 Pro41-Random42 Gly41-Random42 Random41-Pro42 Random41-Gly42 Random41-Ala42 Ile41-Random42 No. colonies analyzed >5000 >5000 >5000 >2000 >2000 >2000 >1500 >1000 >1200 No. possible amino acid combinations 400 49 25 20 20 20 20 20 20 Open table in a new tab To assess the effect of amino acid substitutions at residues 41 and 42 on the aggregation of Aβ42, the library of Aβ42-GFP fusions was expressed at 30 °C, and the resulting colonies were characterized. In a typical experiment, 1520 colonies were analyzed. Of these, 140 colonies (9%) were white, similar to colonies expressing GFP fusions to wild type Aβ42. The remaining 1380 colonies (91%) showed some level of green fluorescence (TABLE TWO). 34 clones from this library were chosen arbitrarily for further characterization by sequence analysis and fluorescence measurements. The correlation between sequence and fluorescence is shown in Fig. 1.TABLE TWOGreen/white phenotypic screening of colonies expressing Aβ(42)-GFP fusions Random at both 41, 42 Hydrophobic at both 41,42 Hydrophilic at both 41,42 Pro41-Random42 Gly41-Random42 Random41-Pro42 Random41-Gly42 Random41-Ala42 Ile41-Random42 White colonies 140 5000 640 17 18 25 30 37 44 Green colonies 1380 0 4160 210 160 220 290 153 141 Open table in a new tab The Effect of Hydrophobicity at Residues 41 and 42—As shown in Fig. 1A, GFP fusions to mutants with hydrophobic residues at positions 41 and 42 display low fluorescence, similar to fusions to wild type (Ile41-Ala42)Aβ42. In contrast, fusions to mutants with hydrophilic residues at positions 41 and 42 show high fluorescence, similar to fusions to Aβ40. These results suggest that hydrophobic side chains at positions 41 and 42 increase the propensity of Aβ42 to aggregate. To confirm this correlation, we produced two additional libraries of mutants. In one library, residues 41 and 42 were mutated to a combinatorial mixture of hydrophobic residues. In the other library, these residues were mutated to a combinatorial mixture of hydrophilic residues. The hydrophobic library was constructed using the degenerate DNA codon NTN to encode a mixture of nonpolar residues including Ile, Leu, Val, Met, and Phe (32Hecht M. Das A. Go A. Bradley L. Wei Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1711-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic library was constructed using the NAN codon to encode a mixture of polar residues including Glu, Gln, Asp, Asn, Lys, His, and Tyr (where N denotes a mixture of the four DNA bases). Both libraries were plated, and protein was expressed at 30 °C. For the 41/42-hydrophobic library, >5000 colonies were analyzed and none were green. Thus, randomly chosen hydrophobic residues at positions 41 and 42 support Aβ42 aggregation. In contrast, for the 41/42-hydrophilic library, 4800 colonies were analyzed, and 87% of them (4160 colonies) were green. This result indicates that randomly chosen polar residues at positions 41 and 42 disrupt the aggregation of Aβ42. From the hydrophilic library, only 640 colonies (13%) were white. We tested 64 of these colonies for expression of the Aβ42-GFP fusions, and we found that all but one of them did not express the fusion protein. (Because we used the NAN degenerate codon at positions 41 and 42, it was expected that the library would contain stop codons, which prevent protein expression.) The other white colony expressed normal levels of the fusion protein. Sequence analysis of this clone revealed that it had arginine at both positions 41 and 42. Thus, although most randomly chosen polar residues at positions 41 and 42 interfere with Aβ aggregation, arginine is somehow special and allows aggregation (see below). Effect of the β-Sheet Propensity of Residues 41 and 42—Amyloid structures are dominated by β-sheet secondary structure (33Serpell L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 34Makin O.S. Atkins E. Sikorski P. Johansson J. Serpell L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), and previous studies suggested a strong correlation between the tendency of a sequence to form amyloid and the β-sheet propensities of its component amino acids (26Chiti F.

These residues have very low intrinsic propensities for β-sheet structure (39Creighton T. Proteins,. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 171-200Google Scholar). All 10 of these mutants displayed high levels of fluorescence (Fig. 1B). To study further the role of β-sheet propensity at residues 41 and 42, we constructed additional libraries in which β-sheet breakers were incorporated intentionally at position 41 or 42. Four libraries were constructed as follows: Pro41-Random42, Gly41-Random42, Random41-Pro42, and Random41-Gly42. For each library, 20 different sequences are possible. To ensure extensive sampling, 178-320 colonies were analyzed for each library (TABLE TWO). For all four libraries, ∼90% of colonies were green. The non-green colonies were assayed for protein expression, and none expressed the fusions. (As described above, non-expressers arise from stop codons encoded by the NNN degenerate codon.) These results indicate that the ability of residues 41 and 42 to form β-sheet structure is important for Aβ aggregation. Effect of the Site of Mutation—To assess which of the two positions affects aggregation more significantly, we constructed two additional libraries. In each of these libraries one of the two C-terminal residues was held constant, whereas the other was randomized. These libraries were called Ile41-Random42 and Random41-Ala42. (The wild type sequence is Ile41-Ala42.) For each library, nearly 200 colonies were analyzed. The Random41-Ala42 library yielded 37 white colonies (19% white), and 153 green colonies. The Ile41-Random42 library yielded 44 white colonies (24% white), and 141 green colonies (TABLE TWO). Because the fraction of white colonies in the two libraries is not significantly different, we conclude that the wild type residues at positions 41 and 42 contribute to aggregation to a similar extent.

https://openalex.org/W2050830515,"The core histone tail domains are known to be key regulators of chromatin structure and function. The tails are required for condensation of nucleosome arrays into secondary and tertiary chromatin structures, yet little is known regarding tail structures or sites of tail interactions in chromatin. We have developed a system to test the hypothesis that the tails participate in internucleosomal interactions during salt-dependent chromatin condensation, and here we used it to examine interactions of the H3 tail domain. We found that the H3 tail participates primarily in intranucleosome interactions when the nucleosome array exists in an extended “beads-on-a-string” conformation and that tail interactions reorganize to engage in primarily internucleosome interactions as the array successively undergoes salt-dependent folding and oligomerization. These results indicated that the location and interactions of the H3 tail domain are dependent upon the degree of condensation of the nucleosomal array, suggesting a mechanism by which alterations in tail interactions may elaborate different structural and functional states of chromatin."

This current plays a crucial role in the control of important biological functions, including cardiac and neuronal pacemaker activity, determination of resting membrane potential, dendritic integration, and synaptic transmission. Dysfunction of HCN channels has been linked to human diseases, including cardiac arrhythmia (5Schulze-Bahr E. Neu A. Friederich P. Kaupp U.B. Breithardt G. Pongs O. Isbrandt D. J. Clin.

In the plasma membrane, HCN channel subunits assemble to homo- or heterotetrameric complexes, thereby generating a large variety of channel subtypes with distinct biophysical properties (12Frère S.G. Kuisle M. Lüthi A. Mol. Neurobiol. 2004; 30: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Further complexity is probably generated in vivo by the interaction of HCN channels with auxiliary subunits (13Yu H. Wu J. Potapova I. Wymore R.T. Holmes B. Zuckerman J. Pan Z. Wang H. Shi W.

Whereas our knowledge of the structure and function of HCN channels has significantly increased over the last couple of years, there is only sparse information on the cellular regulation of these channels. It is well established that hormones and neurotransmitters can modulate Ih activity via G-protein pathways that modulate the cAMP concentration (1Pape H.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 299-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP enhances channel activity by direct binding to a cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) present in the C terminus of HCN channels. The region linking the last membrane-spanning domain (S6) to the CNBD (the C-linker) has been shown to play a key role in coupling cAMP binding with channel opening (18Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 19Wang J. Chen S. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen.

Neuron. 2004; 44: 823-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Unlike in many other ion channels the modulation by cAMP does not seem to involve protein kinase A-mediated serine/threonine phosphorylation (21DiFrancesco D. Tortora P. Nature. 1991; 351: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). By contrast, several experimental observations suggest that nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), especially members of the Src family, may regulate HCN channels (1Pape H.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 299-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The HCN1 channel was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the SH3 domain of Src as bait. However, it was not reported whether this interaction also occurs in native tissue and whether Src influences channel activity (22Santoro B. Grant S.G. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14815-14820Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Based on experiments with genistein, a broad spectrum PTK inhibitor, it was suggested that cardiac Ih is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (23Wu J.Y. Cohen I.S. Pflugers Arch. 1997; 434: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Wu J.Y. Yu H. Cohen I.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 463: 15-19Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Yu H.G. Lu Z. Pan Z. Cohen I.S. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, this finding was challenged by another group reporting that the genistein effect is caused through nonselective interactions with the channel molecule (26Shibata S. Ono K. Iijima T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1284-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Src is widely expressed in neurons and heart cells and has been shown to be an important regulator of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels (27Davis M.J. Wu X. Nurkiewicz T.R. Kawasaki J. Gui P. Hill M.A. Wilson E. Am. J. Physiol. Heart. Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1835-H1862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore asked in the present study whether or not this kinase is involved in HCN channel modulation. Using genetic, biochemical, and electrophysiological methods, we demonstrate that Src specifically binds to the C terminus of HCN channels, phosphorylates the channels and thereby affects the activation kinetics of Ih. Moreover we identify a specific tyrosine residue in the C-linker region of HCN channels that is the molecular target of Src. Yeast Two-hybrid (YTH) Assay—C-terminal portions of murine HCN2 (mHCN2) were subcloned into plasmid pEG202 (Clontech) in-frame with the LexA DNA binding domain to yield the following bait proteins (see also Fig. 4A): CT, residues 449-863; L, residues 449-522; BD, residues 523-646; L+BD, residues 449-646; dC, residues 649-863; L-β8, residues 449-607; C′-BD, residues 487-646. The cDNAs of full-length chicken c-Src (residues 1-533) and the SH3 domain (residues 81-139) of c-Src were fused to B42 activation domain of the plasmid pJG4-5 (Clontech). Bacterial GST Fusion Proteins—C-terminal fragments of mHCN2 were subcloned into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences) to generate the following GST-tagged proteins: CT, residues 448-863; L, residues 448-520; BD, residues 521-644; L+BD, residues 448-644; dC, residues 645-863. The SH3 domain of c-Src was cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI site of plasmid pET41a (Novagen) to produce a GST-SH3 fusion protein. Expression in HEK293 Cells—The cDNAs of wild-type and mutant mHCN2 and hHCN4 were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A Myc-tagged c-Src was constructed in the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen). The dominant-negative mutant of chicken c-Src (Src-K295M) was subcloned in the pIRES2-EGFP vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). Mutant HCN channels were generated by standard PCR techniques. All plasmid constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae EGY48 was used for YTH assays. pEG202 and pJG4-5 fusion plasmids, together with the lacZ reporter plasmid pSH18-34 (BD Biosciences, Clontech) were transformed into yeast by the lithium acetate method. To identify specific interactions transformants were grown on four different selective plates: 1) X-gal plates lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan, and containing galactose and raffinose as carbon source; 2) X-gal plates lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan, and containing glucose as carbon source; 3) plates lacking uracil, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine, and containing galactose and raffinose as carbon source; 4) plates lacking uracil, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine, and containing glucose as carbon source. An interaction was considered to be specific if a given transformant turned blue on plate condition 1, stayed white on plate condition 2, was able to grow on plate condition 3, and did not show growth on plate condition 4. Fig. 4B shows examples from selective plates 1 and 2. GST fusion proteins were expressed in the protease-deficient BL21 (DE3) strain of Escherichia coli by induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), for 1 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation (10 min, 4 °C, 5,000 × g) and resuspended in 4 ml of PBS supplemented with protease inhibitor mix (PI) containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml antipain, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthophenanthroline, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm iodacetamide. After a freeze-thaw cycle, lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. After incubation for 30 min on ice, 1% Triton X-100 was added, and the cell suspension was shaken for 30 min to improve solubility of the fusion proteins. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation (30 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. For purification of GST fusion proteins, supernatant was incubated with 1 volume of 50% slurry glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. The loaded beads were pelleted by centrifugation (5 min, 500 × g, 4 °C) and washed twice with ice-cold PBS supplemented with PI. Beads were resuspended in 1 volume of PBS/PI and stored at 4 °C. About 3 μg of purified GST fusion protein was diluted into 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100). 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min and washed three times with 1× HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerin, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% Triton X-100). After removing the supernatant, beads were incubated with total lysates from transfected or untransfected HEK293 cells for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted after repeating the steps of centrifugation and washing. 20 μl of SDS loading buffer were added, and the mixture was heated 5 min at 100 °C before loading onto an SDS-PAGE gel. Beads preloaded with about 2 μg of GST fusion proteins (see GST pull-down assay) were washed three times with 1× HNTG buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm pervanadate, 0.35 mm ATP). The beads then were mixed with 40 μl of reaction buffer (kinase buffer supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) with or without 1 unit of purified c-Src (Oncogene Research Products). The reaction was carried out by shaking at room temperature for 15 min. After centrifugation and discarding the supernatant, the reaction was stopped by adding SDS loading buffer. All samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (anti-pY) (Upstate Biotechnology) was used to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Membrane Fractions—Freshly isolated mouse brain tissue was washed with PBS and homogenized in ice-cold MOPS lysis buffer (0.3 mm sucrose, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 200 μm pervanadate and PI, using a glass cylinder and a Teflon plunger. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 × g. The pellet was rehomogenized and spun once more for 10 min. The combined supernatants were then centrifuged (45 min, 4 °C, 100,000 × g). The pellet comprising the total membrane fraction was resuspended in MOPS lysis buffer supplemented with 200 μm pervanadate and stored at -80 °C. Cell Lysates—Three days after transfection, HEK293 cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 500 μl of cell lysis buffer supplemented with 200 μm pervanadate and PI. After 10 min on ice the lysed cells were scraped off the dish and transferred to a reaction tube. The lysate was centrifuged (15 min, 4 °C, 12,000 × g), and the supernatant was subject to coimmunoprecipitation or stored at -80 °C. Total brain membrane fractions or cell lysates of HEK293 cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and a specific antibody directed against one of the two examined proteins and 500 μl of HNTG buffer supplemented with 200 μm pervanadate and PI. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation (15 min, 4 °C, 12,000 × g) and washed three times with cold HNTG buffer supplemented with 200 μm pervanadate. Interacting proteins were visualized after boiling for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The following antibodies used were: anti-HCN2 (Alomone), anti-Src (GD11, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-GST (Amersham Biosciences), anti-Myc (9E10); anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10 (anti-pY), Upstate Biotechnology Inc. and p-Tyr-100, Cell Signaling Technology). An antibody against the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel CNGB3 (28Michalakis S. Geiger H. Haverkamp S. Hofmann F. Gerstner A. Biel M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 1516-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was used as control. The GST fusion protein containing the whole C terminus of HCN2 (amino acids 448-863) was in vitro phosphorylated by Src. Thereafter, the protein was boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated on a 10% Tris-glycine gel, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The piece of gel containing the HCN2 fusion protein was excised and in-gel-digested with trypsin according to standard procedures. Tryptic peptides were extracted with 5% formic acid/50% acetronitrile, dried, and stored at -20 °C until analysis by mass spectrometry. A surveyor liquid chromatography system (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA), consisting of degasser, MS Pump, and autosampler, equipped with a C18 trap column (RP, 300 μm × 5 mm, Agilent Technologies) and PicoFrit™ column: 75 μm × 100 mm, 15-μm tip packed with a 5-μm Aquasil C18 (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) was used. The samples were loaded onto the column with an RP gradient of 2-98% B over 180 min. RP solvents were 0.1% formic acid in either water (A) or acetonitrile (B). The flow rate was 200 nl/min. A Finnigan LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI microspray source was used for MS/MS experiment with ion transfer capillary of 160 °C and NSI voltage of 1.8 kV. The mass spectrometer was set that one full MS scan was followed by ten MS/MS scans on the ten most intense ions from the MS spectrum. Spectra from each fraction were searched by SEQUEST algorithm against the mHCN2 sequence. In these searches, differential modifications of 80 daltons to tyrosine residues were selected. For all sequences reported here, spectra were manually validated and contained sufficient information to assign not only the sequence, but also the site of phosphorylation. All output results were combined using home made software to delete the redundant data. HEK293 cells (DMSZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and incubated at 37 °C with 10% CO2. For transfection, HEK293 cells were seeded on 6-well plates (diameter 3.5 cm) at a density of 700,000 cells per well. After 6 h, cells were transfected with expression plasmid DNA (0.6 μg of each plasmid per well) using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). For electrophysiological measurements, transfected cells were detached using 0.05% trypsin/0.5 mm EDTA (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) and replated onto 12-mm poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in 24-well plates. HL-1 cardiomyocytes were obtained from Dr. W. C. Claycomb (Lousiana State University Health Science Center, New Orleans, LA) and maintained in Claycomb Medium (JRH Biosciences, Andover, UK), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 10 μm noradrenaline, and penicillin-streptomycin as previously described (29Claycomb W.C. Lanson Jr., N.A. Stallworth B.S. Egeland D.B. Delcarpio J.B. Bahinski A. Izzo Jr., N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2979-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Single HL-1 cells were detached from confluent cultures using trypsin-EDTA. Isolated cells were either replated or directly used for patch-clamp experiments. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were isolated from adult mice as described by Wu et al. (30Wu Z.Z. Pan H.L. Brain. Res. 2004; 1029: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, thoracic and lumbar DRGs were dissected and transferred immediately into DMEM medium. After removal of attached nerves and connective tissues ganglion fragments were placed in a microtube containing 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with trypsin (type I, 0.5 mg/ml, Sigma), collagenase (type I, 1 mg/ml, Sigma) and DNase (type I, 0.1 mg/ml, Sigma) and were incubated at 34 °C for 30 min. Thereafter, soybean trypsin inhibitor (type II-S, 1.25 mg/ml, Sigma) was added to stop trypsin digestion. The cell suspension was centrifuged (500 rpm, 3 min) to remove the supernatant and replenished with DMEM. Cells were then plated onto a 35-mm culture dish precoated with poly-l-lysine and kept in an incubator (37 °C, 10% CO2) for at least 1 h before electrophysiological recordings. Medium sized DRG neurons (30-45 μm) were selected for recordings. Pacemaker cells were prepared from sino-atrial node of adult mice as described by us previously (31Wahl-Schott C. Baumann L. Zong X. Biel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13694-13700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Currents of heterologously expressed HCN channels were measured at room temperature 2-3 days after transfection using whole cell voltage clamp technique. The extracellular solution was composed of (in mm): 110 NaCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, 30 KCl, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH. The intracellular solution contained (in mm): 130 KCl, 10 NaCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4 adjusted with KOH. For measurement of HCN currents of HL-1 cells the pipette solution was composed according to Sartiani et al. (32Sartiani L. Bochet P. Cerbai E. Mugelli A. Fischmeister R. J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (in mm): 120 potassium aspartate, 10 TEA-Cl, 0.4 Na2GTP, 2 MgCl2, 11 EGTA, 5 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH. The bath solution contained (in mm): 110 NaCl, 30 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 2 BaCl2, 5 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. For measurement of Ih currents of DRG neurons the pipette solution was composed (in mm): 130 potassium aspartate, 10 NaCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 1 CaCl2, 3 Mg-ATP, 5 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH. The bath solution contained (mm): 110 NaCl, 30 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 5 BaCl2, 5 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The Ih currents of sinoatrial node cells were measured as described previously (31Wahl-Schott C. Baumann L. Zong X. Biel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13694-13700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (GC150TF, Harvard Apparatus LTD) and had resistances of 2-3 MΩ when filled with the intracellular solution. Src kinase inhibitors (PP2 and genistein) and their respective inactive derivatives (PP3, daidzein) were purchased from Calbiochem (Germany). Stock solutions of these substances were prepared in Me2SO and were freshly diluted at least 1:1,000 in bath solution before using in experiments. The effects of Src inhibitors were determined after incubation of cells with the substances for at least 10 min. Data were acquired at 10 kHz using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp 8 (Axon Instruments). Voltage clamp data were stored on the computer hard disk and analyzed off-line by using Clampfit 8 (Axon Instruments). Steady-state activation curves were determined by hyperpolarizing voltages of -140 mV to -30 mV from a holding potential of -40 mV for 3.2 s (for wild-type and mutant HCN2) and 4.8 s (for HCN4) followed by a step to -140 mV. Tail currents measured immediately after the final step to -140 mV, were normalized by the maximal current (Imax) and plotted as a function of the preceding membrane potential. The data points were fitted with the Boltzmann function: (I - Imin)/(Imax - Imin) = {1 - exp[(Vm - V0.5)/k]} where Imin is an offset caused by a nonzero holding current, Vm is the test potential, V0.5 is the membrane potential for half-maximal activation, and k is the slope factor. Time constants of channel activation (τact) of wild-type and mutant HCN2 and HCN4 channels were determined by monoexponential (or biexponential in the case of HCN2-Y476F and Ih of DRG neurons) function fitting the current evoked during hyperpolarizing voltage pulses to -140 mV unless otherwise specified. As has been described earlier (33Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) the initial lag in the activation of HCN channels was excluded from the fitting procedure. Statistical analyses were performed with Origin6.1 (OriginLab). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. (n = number of recorded cells). Inhibition of Src Slows Down Kinetics of Expressed HCN2 Channel—We investigated the effect of Src on HCN2 channels expressed in HEK293 cells. These cells endogenously express substantial amounts of Src making them a suitable system for our purpose (Fig. 1A). Preincubation of HCN2-expressing cells with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 (10 μm) led to a profound deceleration of HCN2 activation kinetics (Fig. 1, B and F). The activation time constant (τact) at -140 mV increased from 277 ± 14 ms (n = 13) at control conditions to 538 ± 29 ms (n = 19) in the presence of PP2. In contrast, PP2 had no effect on current densities (pA/pF: PP2, -78.9 ± 12.4 (n = 25); control, -84.4 ± 12.5 (n = 27), p > 0.05). The effect on τact was present over the whole voltage range (supplemental Fig. S1). By contrast, PP3, an inactive analogue of PP2, did not affect current kinetics (Fig. 1, C and F, supplemental Fig. S1). Similarly, another Src kinase inhibitor, genistein (Fig. 1, D and F), but not its inactive analogue daidzein (Fig. 1F), also slowed down the HCN2 current. The finding that two structurally unrelated PTK inhibitors affected HCN2 in the same fashion argued against a nonspecific action of these agents. More likely, the effect of PP2 and genistein was caused by specific inhibition of Src and subsequent channel dephosphorylation by cellular tyrosine phosphatases. To further strengthen this hypothesis, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with HCN2 and a catalytically inactive Src mutant, Src-K295M (Src-KM) (34Snyder M.A. Bishop J.M. McGrath J.P. Levinson A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Indeed, HCN2 currents obtained from these cells activated with slower kinetics than control currents (τact = 353 ± 7.4 (n = 6); Fig. 1, E and F). The effect induced by Src-K295M was somewhat weaker than that of PP2, probably because of the high levels of endogenous wild-type Src. Inhibition of Src also led to inhibition of deactivation kinetics (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, neither PP2 nor PP3 did affect the voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 2, C and D). Regulation of HCN2 by cAMP was principally preserved in the presence of PP2. Cyclic AMP shifted the half-maximal activation voltage (V0.5) by about +10 mV and speeded up activation kinetics (TABLE ONE). Interestingly, however, the activation kinetics in the presence of saturating cAMP + PP2 was consistently slower than that observed with cAMP alone (τact(PP2, cAMP) = 272 ± 23 ms (n = 12); τact(cAMP) = 163 ± 6.84 ms (n = 8)) indicating that the decelerating effect of PP2 persisted in the presence of cAMP.TABLE ONEEffects of cAMP on HCN2 current in the absence and presence of PP2Channels0 mm cAMP1 mm cAMPV0.5knτactnV0.5nknτactnmVmVmsmVmVmsHCN2−94.2 ± 0.896.88 ± 0.3812250 ± 1410−84.6 ± 0.9487.91 ± 0.448164 ± 6.848HCN2 + PP2−95.6 ± 0.735.65 ± 0.298633 ± 258−85.4 ± 1.13117.35 ± 0.5311272 ± 2312 Open table in a new tab HCN2 Binds Src and Undergoes Tyrosine Phosphorylation—We performed a series of immunoprecipitation experiments to determine whether HCN2 is a substrate of Src (Fig. 3A). In the first set of experiments, cells expressing HCN2 were preincubated with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate (PV) prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-HCN2. A specific band corresponding to the molecular mass of HCN2 (105 kDa) was detected with a specific anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (anti-pY). This band was significantly weaker when cells were pretreated with both PV and PP2. Similarly, the intensity of the band was reduced in HCN2/Src-KM-coexpressing cells pretreated with PV. Taken together, these findings suggested that HCN2 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by Src and is dephosphorylated by cellular phosphatases if Src is inhibited. We next studied whether an interaction between Src and HCN also occurs in native tissue. To this end, immunoprecipitations with mouse brain membrane fractions were performed (Fig. 3B). Src was present in immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-HCN2 but not with a control antibody (anti-CNGB3) indicating that Src is bound to HCN2 in vivo. Moreov"
https://openalex.org/W2098487844,"Amphotericin B is a medically important antifungal antibiotic that is also active against human immunodeficiency virus, Leishmania parasites, and prion diseases. The therapeutic use of amphotericin B is restricted by severe side effects that can be moderated by liposomal formulation or structural alteration. Chemical modification has shown that suppression of charge on the exocyclic carboxyl group of amphotericin B substantially reduces toxicity. We report targeted deletions of the amphN cytochrome P450 gene from the chromosome of the amphotericin-producing bacterium Streptomyces nodosus. The mutant strains produced amphotericin analogues in which methyl groups replace the exocyclic carboxyl groups. These compounds retained antifungal activity and had reduced hemolytic activity.

The mutant strains produced amphotericin analogues in which methyl groups replace the exocyclic carboxyl groups. These compounds retained antifungal activity and had reduced hemolytic activity. There are increasingly urgent requirements for new antibiotics to treat infectious disease (1Walsh C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The need is especially acute with systemic fungal infections that are increasing in incidence and are often fatal (2Georgopapadakou N.H. Walsh T.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 279-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the few antifungals available at present, the most reliable is amphotericin B (compound 1 in Fig. 1), a polyene macrolide synthesized by Streptomyces nodosus (3Hartsel S. Bolard J. Trends Pharm. Sci. 1996; 17: 445-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Amphotericin B disrupts ergosterol-containing fungal membranes and has a broad spectrum of activity. Whereas resistance to most non-polyene antifungals has appeared rapidly, the most prevalent fungal pathogens of humans have been slow to develop resistance to amphotericin B, even after more than three decades of clinical use (4Masia Canuto M. Gutierrez Rodero F. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2002; 2: 550-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The advantages of amphotericin B are offset by toxicity that results from low water solubility and interactions with cholesterol in mammalian membranes. Toxicity has also prevented full exploitation of the antiviral, antiprion, and antiparasitic properties of amphotericin B (3Hartsel S. Bolard J. Trends Pharm. Sci. 1996; 17: 445-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The adverse effects of the drug can be reduced by liposomal formulation, heat-induced superaggregation, or structural alteration (5Lemke A. Kiderlen A.F. Kayser O. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 68: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Chemical modification has shown that suppression of charge on the exocyclic carboxyl group reduces toxicity and improves antifungal specificity (6Cheron M. Cybulska B. Mazerski J. Gryzbowska J. Czerwinski A. Borowski E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Further improvements have been made by derivatization with additional sugars (7Szlinder-Richert J. Mazerski J. Cybulska B. Grzybowska J. Borowski E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Substantial reduction in amphotericin B toxicity would minimize adverse side effects on patients and also allow high dose treatment of infections by emerging fungal pathogens that are sensitive only to high concentrations of the drug. Non-toxic amphotericin analogues and formulations may also be useful in other therapeutic areas. Polyene antibiotics delay the onset of prion diseases in animal models (8Pocchiari M. Schmittinger S. Masullo C. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These effects are thought to result from interactions of polyenes with cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains that contain glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored prion proteins (3Hartsel S. Bolard J. Trends Pharm. Sci. 1996; 17: 445-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 9Mange A. Milhavet O. McMahon H.E.M. Casanova D. Lehmann S. J. Neurochemistry. 2000; 74: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Amphotericin B formulations are gaining favor for treatment of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, particularly as resistance to other anti-Leishmania drugs continues to increase (10Gaboriou F. Cheron M. Petit C. Bolard J. Croft S.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 390-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyenes may also become important in treatment of viral infections. Polyenes interfere with the sterol-rich membranes of enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (3Hartsel S. Bolard J. Trends Pharm. Sci. 1996; 17: 445-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Recently, amphotericin B has been found to reactivate latent HIV in macrophages, and these polyene-stimulated cells in turn induce viral reactivation in T lymphocytes (11Jones J. Kosloff B.R. Benviste E.N. Shaw G.M. Kutsch O. Virology. 2005; 331: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although the current highly active antiretroviral therapy effectively eliminates free virus, reservoirs of provirus must be reactivated to allow complete clearance (11Jones J. Kosloff B.R. Benviste E.N. Shaw G.M. Kutsch O. Virology. 2005; 331: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Amphotericin B derivatives may form part of a strategy for eradication, rather than suppression, of the virus in AIDS patients. Although total synthesis of amphotericin B has been achieved (12Nicolaou K.C. Daines R.A. Ogawa Y. Chakraborty T.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 4696-4705Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the synthetic route toward production of improved antibiotics is not economically feasible. The starting material for lipid formulation or chemical modification is amphotericin B isolated from cultures of S. nodosus. Recent studies on amphotericin biosynthesis in this organism have led to the possibility of obtaining non-toxic analogues as primary fermentation products (13McNamara C.M. Box S. Crawforth J.M. Hickman B.S. Norwood T.J. Rawlings B.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1998; 1: 83-87Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Caffrey P. Lynch S.V. Flood E. Finnan S. Oliynyk M. Chem.

The carbon chain of the amphotericin B macrolactone is assembled from acetate and propionate units by a modular polyketide synthase (13McNamara C.M. Box S. Crawforth J.M. Hickman B.S. Norwood T.J. Rawlings B.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1998; 1: 83-87Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The polyketide precursor undergoes three modifications to form the final antibiotic, namely oxidation of a methyl branch to a carboxyl group, glycosylation with GDP-mycosamine, and hydroxylation at C-8 (13McNamara C.M. Box S. Crawforth J.M. Hickman B.S. Norwood T.J. Rawlings B.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1998; 1: 83-87Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Amphotericin A (compound 2 in Fig. 1), a less active tetraene, 2The term “tetraene” is used to describe amphotericin A and derivatives in which the C-28=C-29 double bond is reduced. Amphotericin B and derivatives with a series of seven conjugated double bonds are described as heptaenes. is produced as a co-metabolite. The enoyl reductase domain in module 5 of the polyketide synthase is thought to be sluggish, reducing only some of the enoyl-acyl carrier protein 5 oligoketide intermediates so that amphotericin A is produced as well as amphotericin B (14Caffrey P. Lynch S.V. Flood E. Finnan S. Oliynyk M. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The biosynthetic gene cluster contains two cytochrome P450 genes, amphL and amphN (13McNamara C.M. Box S. Crawforth J.M. Hickman B.S. Norwood T.J. Rawlings B.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1998; 1: 83-87Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Phage KC515-mediated disruption of amphL led to synthesis of 8-deoxyamphotericin B (15Byrne B. Carmody M. Gibson E. Rawlings B. Caffrey P. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Disruption of amphN was expected to block oxidation of the C-16 methyl group in the macrolactone. Subsequent glycosylation and C-8 hydroxylation would yield 16-descarboxyl-16-methyl-amphotericin B (compound 3 in Fig. 1), a compound that could rival amphotericin B methyl ester (compound 4 in Fig. 1), a semi-synthetic derivative with an improved therapeutic index (3Hartsel S. Bolard J. Trends Pharm. Sci. 1996; 17: 445-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, because homologous recombination in S. nodosus is unpredictable, numerous previous attempts to disrupt amphN were unsuccessful. Here we report the targeted deletion of this gene. Genetic Procedures—Escherichia coli XL1-Blue was used for routine cloning. E. coli ET 12567 was used to obtain non-methylated DNA for digestion with BclI. S. nodosus ATCC14899 was used as the parent strain for gene replacements. Streptomyces lividans 66 (John Innes strain 1326) was used as the host for the construction of recombinant phages. Construction of phages KC-DI and KC-ΔNM was carried out as described previously (16Carmody M. Byrne B. Murphy B. Lynch S. Flood F. Finnan S. Caffrey P. Gene. 2004; 343: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000: 289-310Google Scholar). PCR was used to identify recombinant phages. Oligonucleotide primers D1F (5′-AAAAGATCTTGGAGAAGGCCGTCGAGGAGATCC-3′) and D1R (5′-AGGACATATGTGACTTCCTCGGTCAGTCGTTTGC-3′) were used to detect recombinant phage KC-DI, and primers KCNM-F (5′-GCGGGGATCCGAGGGTCACCAGGACCTTTGTCTTC-3′) and KCNM-R (5′-TGACAGATCTGGACCAGGAGTTCATCACCG-3′) were used to identify KC-ΔNM phages. Isolation of genomic DNA and Southern hybridization were carried out as described (14Caffrey P. Lynch S.V. Flood E. Finnan S. Oliynyk M. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 15Byrne B. Carmody M. Gibson E. Rawlings B. Caffrey P. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). S. nodosus lysogens were selected with thiostrepton. To obtain revertants resulting from a second cross-over recombination event, the lysogen was cultured in the absence of thiostrepton for several generations and protoplasted. Thiostrepton-sensitive revertants were identified by using toothpicks to place individual regenerated protoplast colonies onto tryptone soya agar and tryptone soya agar containing thiostrepton. Production and Analysis of Polyenes—For polyene production, S. nodosus mutants were grown on fructose dextrin soya medium as described previously (15Byrne B. Carmody M. Gibson E. Rawlings B. Caffrey P. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Four 500-ml cultures were centrifuged, and the sedimented mycelium was extracted with 400 ml of acetone to recover the polyenes. After concentration by evaporation, polyenes were extracted from the aqueous residue with 50 ml of butan-1-ol. The extract was evaporated to dryness, and the polyenes were dissolved in 4 ml of methanol. The methanol-soluble polyene sample was applied to an Amberlite XAD16 column (2.5 × 50 cm). Polyenes were recovered after isocratic elution with methanol at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions were scanned in the wavelength range 250–450 nm, and those containing the highest concentrations of polyene were pooled and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The sample was then purified by gel filtration on a lipophilic Sephadex LH20 column. Batches of 2 ml containing up to 6 mg of total polyene (the heptaene/tetraene ratio varied between 1:3 and 10:1) were applied to a Sephadex LH20 column (50 × 2.5 cm), equilibrated with methanol and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml per min. The absorption spectrum of each fraction was measured in the wavelength range 250–450 nm. This result revealed that gel filtration partially resolved the tetraene from the heptaene. With amphotericin-derived tetraenes, reduction of the double bond between C-28 and C-29 alters the molecular shape by making the polyene chain more flexible. This could assist resolution of tetraenes and heptaenes. The usefulness of Sephadex LH20 gel permeation for separating hydroxy lipids has been reported (18Calderon M. Baumann W.J. J. Lipid Res. 1970; 11: 167-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of heptaene and tetraene solutions were determined by measuring absorbance values at 405 nm and 305 nm, respectively. An extinction co-efficient of 161,000 liters mol–1 cm–1 was used for amphotericin B and heptaene analogues. An extinction coefficient of 79400 liters mol–1 cm–1 was used for tetraene analogues of amphotericin A (13McNamara C.M. Box S. Crawforth J.M. Hickman B.S. Norwood T.J. Rawlings B.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1998; 1: 83-87Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) 3The abbreviations used are: ESMS, electrospray mass spectrometry; MHC, minimum hemolytic concentration; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration. was performed with a Quattro Micro tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Micromass Ltd., Manchester UK) in positive and negative ion modes. Exact mass measurements of the analytes were determined using an on-line liquid chromatography to a time-of-flight instrument (Waters Corporation, Micromass Ltd., Manchester UK). N-Acetylated heptaene compound 3 (Fig. 1) was prepared as follows. A crude polyene extract from the ΔNM strain containing 24 mg of heptaene was dried in vacuo. The residue was suspended in 3 ml of methanol/Me2SO (2:1). Acetic anhydride (0.1 ml; 1.06 mmol) was added with stirring at 0 °C for 20 min. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 1 h. A 100-ml volume of diethyl ether was added, and the resulting polyene precipitate was sedimented by centrifugation. About 11 mg of modified heptaene was recovered. This was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography on a Supelco silica preparative column (25 cm × 21 mm; 5 μm) with a gradient of 10–15% methanol in ethyl acetate. Approximately 5 mg of N-acetylated heptaene compound 3 was obtained. This material was used for structural characterization by NMR. Spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX-400 instrument. Assessment of Biological Activities of Polyenes—Bioassays were carried out as described previously (15Byrne B. Carmody M. Gibson E. Rawlings B. Caffrey P. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Candida albicans was obtained from the culture collection of the Department of Industrial Microbiology, University College Dublin. Horse erythrocytes were used to determine minimum hemolytic concentrations (MHCs). Serial 2-fold dilutions were prepared from concentrated stock solutions of polyenes in methanol. A 50-μl volume of each polyene dilution was mixed with 250 μl of 2.5% (v/v) defibrinated horse blood in phosphate-buffered saline. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and hemolysis was assessed visually or by sedimenting unlysed erythrocytes and determining the absorbance of the supernatant fluid at 545 nm. The MHC was recorded as the lowest concentration that gave complete hemolysis. Deletion of the amphDII and amphN Genes—Within the amphotericin biosynthetic gene cluster, the amphN P450 and amphM ferredoxin genes are located downstream from the amphDII and DI genes that encode mycosamine synthase and mycosaminyl transferase (14Caffrey P. Lynch S.V. Flood E. Finnan S. Oliynyk M. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of amphN was found to be problematic, with phage constructs failing to integrate or giving unwanted chromosomal deletions that abolished polyene production. The reasons for these failures were not understood, but it was possible that the DNA sequence of the amphN region was only weakly recombinogenic or that disruption of amphN might cause lethal accumulation of toxic polyene biosynthetic intermediates. To gain further insights, a recombinant phage was designed to integrate into the upstream amphDI gene. It was anticipated that this insertion might abolish amphN expression through polar effects. A 1611-bp BclI-PstI fragment (nucleotides 63933 to 65544 in sequence accession AF357202) contains the 3′-end of amphDI and the 5′-end of amphDII. This fragment was cloned between the BamHI and PstI sites of the KC-UCD1 phage vector (16Carmody M. Byrne B. Murphy B. Lynch S. Flood F. Finnan S. Caffrey P. Gene. 2004; 343: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to give KC-DI (Fig. 2A). Correct integration of this phage should leave intact copies of amphDI and amphDII in the chromosome. However, it was anticipated that the integrated prophage DNA might separate the downstream amphDII and amphN genes from their promoter, which is thought to be located upstream of amphDI (14Caffrey P. Lynch S.V. Flood E. Finnan S. Oliynyk M. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Propagation of phage KC-DI on S. nodosus yielded two thiostrepton-resistant lysogens, DI-1 and DI-2. Genomic DNA from these strains was analyzed by Southern hybridization. The 1611-bp BclI-PstI fragment is located within a 2-kb NcoI fragment of S. nodosus chromosomal DNA (nucleotides 63699–65712 of the amphotericin cluster). Phage integration should result in formation of new 10.6- and 3.2-kb NcoI fragments that contain this sequence (Fig. 2B). However, Southern analysis revealed that deletions had occurred around the integration site in both lysogens. S. nodosus DI-2 had lost the 10.6-kb band containing the amphDII region but retained the 3.2-kb band containing amphDI. In contrast, S. nodosus DI-1 had the 10.6-kb band (amphDII region) but not the 3.2-kb band (amphDI region) (Fig. 2C). S. nodosus DI-1 produced no polyenes. Extracts from S. nodosus DI-2 had a UV absorption spectrum characteristic of a tetraene/heptaene mixture with heptaene as the major product. These extracts had antifungal activity that was ∼10 times lower than that of amphotericin B (see below). Analysis of S. nodosus DI-2 genomic DNA by PCR confirmed that the amphDII and amphN genes were deleted (data shown in supplemental Fig. 8, available in the on-line version of this article). The production of a heptaene by this strain suggested that the amphK and amphA polyketide synthase genes on either side of this region remained intact. The amphL gene is located at a distance of 3 kb from amphM and reads in the opposite orientation. This gene was detected by PCR and was presumably still functional. S. nodosus DI-2 lacks the amphN gene and was expected to be deficient in oxidation of the polyene C-16 methyl group to a carboxyl group. This strain also lacks the amphDII gene and should be deficient in the formation of mycosamine. A heptaene-enriched fraction was partially purified by chromatography on Amberlite XAD16 and by gel filtration on lipophilic Sephadex LH20. Analysis by ESMS revealed a compound with a mass appropriate for compound 5 (Fig. 1), an amphotericin analogue with a methyl group instead of the exocyclic carboxyl and a neutral deoxyhexose replacing mycosamine (Fig. 3; calculated molecular mass = 894.5; observed [M + Na]+ = 917.7, [M + K]+ = 933.6, [M – H]– = 893.6, and [M + Cl]– = 929.6). High resolution MS in negative ion mode gave 893.4943, which is consistent with the molecular formula C47H74O16 (calculated exact mass = 893.4899 for [M – H]–). With samples that contained tetraene, a species with a mass of 903.5 was also detected in positive ion mode, and additional species with masses of 879.5 and 915.6 were detected in negative ion mode (supplemental Fig. 9 in the on-line version of this article). These masses are appropriate for compound 6 (Fig. 1), the 8-deoxytetraene analogue of compound 5 (Fig. 1) (calculated molecular mass = 880.5; observed [M + Na]+ = 903.5, [M – H]– = 879.5, and [M + Cl]– = 915.6). The production of compound 5 (Fig. 1) is consistent with the genotype of S. nodosus DI-2. Mycosamine biosynthesis is thought to involve conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose, a ketoisomerization to form GDP-3-keto-6-deoxymannose, and AmphDII-catalyzed transamination to form GDP-mycosamine (14Caffrey P. Lynch S.V. Flood E. Finnan S. Oliynyk M. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The amphDII-deficient S. nodosus DI-2 is capable of synthesizing either GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose or GDP-3-keto-6-deoxymannose. Either of these activated deoxyhexuloses could be reduced and transferred to the modified aglycone by the glycosyl transferase encoded by the intact amphDI gene. GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose reductases have been found to function in the biosynthesis of GDP-d-rhamnose in other bacteria (19Maki M. Jarvinen N. Rabina J. Roos C. Maaheimo H. Renkonen R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is possible that S. nodosus has a ketoreductase that can act on the GDP-deoxyhexulose that accumulates in the absence of AmphDII. Previous chemical modification experiments have shown that a positive charge on the amino sugar is important for antifungal activity of amphotericin B (6Cheron M. Cybulska B. Mazerski J. Gryzbowska J. Czerwinski A. Borowski E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The presence of a neutral sugar is consistent with the reduced antifungal activity of the polyenes from S. nodosus DI-2. These results indicated that the AmphDI glycosyl transferase shows both sugar and aglycone flexibility. Targeted Deletion of the amphN Cytochrome P450 and amphM Ferredoxin Genes—The polyenes produced by S. nodosus DI-2 suggested that amphotericin analogues lacking C-16 carboxyl groups were not toxic to the producing cell. Renewed efforts were made to achieve a targeted disruption of the amphN gene that would leave the glycosylation genes intact. A 1200-bp StuI fragment was deleted from a pUC118 plasmid clone of the 6-kb PstI fragment containing the amphN region of the amphotericin biosynthetic gene cluster (nucleotides 58981–65544). This deletion removed the 3′-end of the amphN gene, the adjacent amphM ferredoxin gene, and part of open reading frame 3, which has no role in amphotericin biosynthesis (14Caffrey P. Lynch S.V. Flood E. Finnan S. Oliynyk M. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The ligated flanking sequences were cloned as a BclI-PstI fragment into the KC-UCD1 phage vector to generate the recombinant phage KC-ΔNM (Fig. 4A). Propagation of this phage on S. nodosus yielded two thiostrepton-resistant lysogens. Analysis of genomic DNA by Southern hybridization revealed that one of these had a correctly integrated prophage (not shown). Thiostrepton-sensitive revertants were identified by screening. Analysis of genomic DNA by PCR revealed that several had undergone gene replacement. Results from a typical deletion mutant are shown in Fig. 4B. Further analysis by Southern hybridization revealed that the 5.3-kb NcoI fragment containing the amphNM region had been replaced by a smaller 4.1-kb fragment (supplemental Fig. 10, available in the on-line version of this article). The deletion mutant was designated S. nodosus ΔNM. This strain gave total polyene yields of up to 0.05 g/liter in unoptimized batch cultures. Under the same growth conditions the wild type S. nodosus produced 1 g/liter of polyene. The ratio of tetraene/heptaene was variable in both strains. Analysis of Polyenes from S. nodosus ΔNM—Polyenes were extracted from mycelium and purified by chromatography on Amberlite XAD16 and by gel filtration on Sephadex LH20. The tetraene eluted ahead of the heptaene, so that with tetraene-rich extracts the tetraene could be separated from lower levels of heptaene. The heptaene could be purified from extracts of cultures that produced this compound exclusively. Absorption spectra of heptaene and tetraene fractions are shown in supplemental Fig. 11 (available in the on-line version of this article). Analysis of the tetraene fraction by ESMS revealed a major compound with a mass appropriate for compound 7 (Fig. 1), 8-deoxy-16-descarboxyl-16-methyl-amphotericin A (Fig. 5; calculated molecular mass 879.5; observed [M + H]+ = 880.5, [M + Cl]– = 914.6). High resolution ESMS gave the molecular formula C47H77NO14 (calculated exact mass for [M + Cl]– = 914.5033, observed mass = 914.5018). The purified heptaene fraction had a major species with a mass appropriate for compound 3, 16-descarboxyl-16-methyl amphotericin B (Fig. 6; calculated molecular mass 893.5; observed [M + H]+ = 894.6, [M + Na]+ = 916.6, [M – H]– = 892.6, and [M + Cl]– = 928.6). A dehydrated form of the heptaene was also detected ([M + H]+ = 876.6 and [M – H]– = 874.6). High resolution ESMS gave the molecular formula C47H75NO15 (calculated exact mass for [M – H]– = 892.5058 and observed mass = 892.5043). It is unclear why the heptaene compound 3 is apparently hydroxylated at C-8, whereas the tetraene compound 7 (Fig. 1) is not. S. nodosus DI-2 also appeared to produce a heptaene compound 5 that is hydroxylated and a tetraene compound 6 (Fig. 1) that is not (see above). It is possible that the AmphM ferredoxin normally co-operates with both the AmphL and AmphN cytochrome P-450s. In the amphNM mutant, AmphL may recruit a different ferredoxin to form a complex that acts less efficiently on the tetraene. Heptaene compound 3 (Fig. 1) was also characterized by NMR. The mycosamine amino group was acetylated to facilitate further purification. Analysis by ESMS revealed molecular ions with masses appropriate for N-acetylated forms of heptaene compound 3 (Fig. 1) ([M + Na]+ = 958.5 and [M + Cl]– = 970.5) (data not shown). Final purification was achieved by high-performance liquid chromatography. Examination by proton NMR (400 MHz, d4-methanol) gave a spectrum reminiscent of that for amphotericin B with four doublets (supplemental Fig. 12, available in the on-line version of this article). However, the integration of the upfield doublet suggested two methyl doublets. Phase-sensitive proton-proton correlation spectroscopy revealed that the resonances at 1.02 were indeed two methyl doublets correlating with 1.24 and 1.82 ppm, the latter being consistent with coupling to the C-16 proton in the expected product (TABLE ONE, Fig. 7, and supplemental Fig. 13, available in the on-line version of this article). These data are consistent with the presence of a methyl group attached to C-16. The assignments are based upon the couplings observed in the correlation spectroscopy spectrum and by chemical shift analogy with amphotericin B.TABLE ONEAnalysis of N-acetylated heptaene compound 3 by NMR Assignment ppm Correlations (strong/weak) 39 1.02 (3H, d) 1.82 41 1.02 (3H, d) 1.24 40 1.12 (3H, d) 2.39 38 1.20 (3H, d) 5.38 16 1.24 (1H) 3.96 6′ 1.26 (3H, d) 3.28 1.30 1.97 1.35 1.82 1.45 4.20 1.49 3.72 18a 1.72 4.33/3.96(3.65/3.22/2.22/1.45w) 36 1.82 1.02 1.97 (1H) 1.30 N-Acetyl 2.02 (3H, s) None 18b 2.22 (1H) 1.72/4.42w 2.25 (1H) 4.20 36 2.38 3.24/5.38w 34 2.39 (1H) 1.12 3.22 (2H) 1.72 35 3.24 (1H) 2.38 5′ 3.28 (1H) 1.26/3.83 3.61 (2H) 1.26w 3.62 (2H) 1.72s 3.72 (2H, ca t) 1.49 3.78 (2H) none 4′ 3.83 (3H) 3.28 17 3.96 (2H, ca t) 1.24/1.72w 4.20 (2H) 1.45m/2.25m 4.33 (2H, ca t) 1.72 19 4.42 (2H, ca t) 6.03/2.22w 1′ 4.61 (1H, br s) None 33 5.38 (1H) 6.18 (H-32) 37 5.38 (1H) 1.20/2.38 31 6.01 (ca dd) 6.18 (H-32) 20 6.03 (ca dd) 4.42 21-32 6.15-6.55 (12H) 6.01/5.38 Open table in a new tab Biological Activities of Novel Polyenes—Agar diffusion assays were used to test the activities of the novel polyenes against C. albicans. Under the conditions used, the tetraene 8-deoxy-16-descarboxyl-16-methyl-amphotericin A (compound 7) showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 5 μg/ml, whereas amphotericin B showed an MIC of 1.25 μg/ml. The tetraene compound 7 (Fig. 1) was therefore four times less active than amphotericin B. However, the tetraene showed a dramatic reduction in hemolytic activity. The minimum hemolytic concentration was 166 μg/ml compared with 5 μg/ml for amphotericin B, a 33-fold reduction. The purest active (non-acetylated) sample of compound 3 (Fig. 1) contained 16-descarboxyl-16-methyl amphotericin B and a dehydrated form of this heptaene. This mixture had an MIC of 1 μg/ml total heptaene against C. albicans, indicating that the antifungal activity is comparable with that of amphotericin B. The MHC was 50 μg/ml, indicating that the heptaene mixture was 10 times less hemolytic than amphotericin B. Previous studies have compared the MICs and MHCs of amphotericin B, its methyl ester, and various semi-synthetic derivatives (6Cheron M. Cybulska B. Mazerski J. Gryzbowska J. Czerwinski A. Borowski E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Taylor A.W. Costello B.J. Hunter P.A. MacLachlan W.S. Shanks C.T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1993; 46: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our results for amphotericin B fall within the range of values obtained by other groups. Slight variations in these estimates presumably result from differences in assay conditions. However, our results indicate that the new analogues (compounds) 3, 5, and 7 (Fig. 1) have antifungal activities that are comparable with that of amphotericin B, whereas their hemolytic activities are lower. The biosynthetic gene clusters for a number of polyenes have now been investigated. These include amphotericin (14Caffrey P. Lynch S.V. Flood E. Finnan S. Oliynyk M. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), nystatin (21Brautaset T. Sekurova O.N. Sletta H. Ellingsen T.E. Strom A.R. Valla S. Zotchev S.B. Chem.

Biol. 2004; 11: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All of these clusters contain cytochrome P450 genes homologous to amphN. These P450 genes are thought to function in formation of the exocyclic carboxyl group that is characteristic of most glycosylated polyenes (26Omura S Tanaka H. Omura S. Macrolide Antibiotics, Chemistry, Biology, and Practice. Academic Press, New York1986: 351-404Google Scholar). The amphotericin, nystatin, and pimaricin clusters contain additional P450 genes (amphL, nysL, and pimD). The AmphL, NysL, and PimD P450s are homologous to each other and are thought to act on the polyol chains of their respective polyene macrolactones. Inactivation of pimD resulted in the formation of 4,5-de-epoxypimaricin (27Mendes M.V. Recio E. Fouces R. Luiten R. Martin J.F. Aparicio J.F. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), whereas inactivation of amphL resulted in the formation of 8-deoxyamphotericin B (15Byrne B. Carmody M. Gibson E. Rawlings B. Caffrey P. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here we show that deletion of amphN and amphM results in formation of novel polyenes with masses appropriate for analogues in which the C-16 methyl group is not oxidized. Modification of the exocyclic carboxyl group of amphotericin B is known to bring about a substantial reduction in its toxicity (6Cheron M. Cybulska B. Mazerski J. Gryzbowska J. Czerwinski A. Borowski E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). When the polyene interacts with membrane sterols, this carboxyl group is thought to contribute to an extensive network of hydrogen bonds that involves the mycosamine amino group, a water molecule, and the sterol hydroxyl group (28Herve M. Debouzy J.C. Borowski E. Cybulska B. Gary-Bobo C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 980: 261-272Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This system of bonds is equally strong in polyene-cholesterol and polyene-ergosterol complexes. With amphotericin B methyl ester, this network is weakened, so that the polyene binds more selectively to ergosterol through specific hydrophobic interactions within the lipid bilayer. The amphotericin analogues (compounds) 3 and 7 (Fig. 1) are expected to show similar improvements in specificity as the C-16 carboxyl groups are replaced by methyl groups. Here we show that these compounds retain good antifungal activity and have lower hemolytic activities than amphotericin B. It is unclear why the yields of these new analogues are lower than that of amphotericin B. However, further strain improvement could lead to production of these compounds on a larger scale to provide material for further chemical modification or lipid formulation. In addition, our results establish the role of the AmphN protein in amphotericin biosynthesis. AmphN is unusual among the cytochrome P450s that modify macrolide antibiotics in that it appears to introduce two oxygen atoms into an unactivated methyl group. Directed evolution could alter the substrate specificity of this enzyme to allow further diversification of polyketide libraries in combinatorial biosynthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2054129096,"During origin-independent replisome assembly, the replication restart protein PriC prefers to load the replication fork helicase, DnaB, to stalled replication forks where there is a gap in the nascent leading strand. However, this activity can be obstructed if the 5′-end of the nascent lagging strand is near the template branch point. Here we provide biochemical evidence that the helicase activities of Rep and PriA function to unwind the nascent lagging strand DNA at such stalled replication forks. PriC then loads the replicative helicase, DnaB, onto the newly generated, single-stranded template for the purposes of replisome assembly and duplex unwinding ahead of the replication fork. Direct rescue of replication forks by the Rep-PriC and PriA-PriC pathways in this manner may contribute to genomic stability by avoiding the potential dangers of fork breakage inherent to recombination-dependent restart pathways. During origin-independent replisome assembly, the replication restart protein PriC prefers to load the replication fork helicase, DnaB, to stalled replication forks where there is a gap in the nascent leading strand.

Direct rescue of replication forks by the Rep-PriC and PriA-PriC pathways in this manner may contribute to genomic stability by avoiding the potential dangers of fork breakage inherent to recombination-dependent restart pathways. Although the two replisomes that proceed from oriC possess enough innate processivity to complete the replication of the entire Escherichiacoli chromosome, the replication forks that begin replication are often not the ones that finish the job at the terminus. Endogenous DNA damage, template nicks, and frozen protein-DNA complexes collapse the fork at a high frequency. Therefore, in addition to DNA repair processes, there must be an accurate system for replication restart in order for the cell to maintain genomic integrity and viability. Loading of DnaB, the replicative helicase, to the chromosome is the key step in replisome assembly. Thus, this process must be highly regulated. In solution, DnaB is maintained in a tight complex with DnaC (1Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), preventing DnaB from loading promiscuously onto single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) 2The abbreviations used are: SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; oligos, oligonucleotides; Pol III HE, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme; nt, nucleotides.-coated single-stranded DNA (2LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A DnaB loading system is required to overcome the inhibition by SSB and deliver DnaB to the correct chromosomal position. For replication initiation at oriC, the recognition factor DnaA binds cooperatively to a series of 9-bp DnaA-boxes and assembles into a complex with the DNA wrapped around the periphery (3Fuller R.S. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). AT-rich repeats are melted (4Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) and DnaA promotes the transfer of DnaB from the DnaB-DnaC complex onto the melted DNA (5Baker T.A. Funnell B.E.

Cell. 1986; 45: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Besides providing duplex unwinding activity at the replication fork, DnaB interacts transiently with the primase, DnaG (7Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which synthesizes a short primer. The DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (Pol III HE) gains access to the DNA by recognizing the primer-template, and the replisome becomes fully assembled with a protein-protein interaction between DnaB and the τ subunit of the holoenzyme (8Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 9Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In cases where the replication fork either encounters a nick in the DNA template or a stalled replication fork undergoes breakage, fork collapse will result in a broken chromosome that is repaired by homologous recombination with an intact sister duplex to generate a D-loop structure (10Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The restart proteins PriA, PriB, and DnaT fulfill the requirement for a loading system to reassemble the replisome and resume replication by delivering DnaB to the structure. PriA has been shown to bind D-loops with high affinity (11McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 12Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25033-25041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This complex is competent to load DnaB from the DnaB/DnaC complex onto the displaced strand of the D-loop. Although PriA possesses 3′ → 5′ DNA helicase activity (14Lee M.S. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8345-8349Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5512-5518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this activity is required neither for replication restart from a D-loop containing molecule in vitro (16Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Xu L. Marians K.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 817-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), nor to complement many of the phenotypes associated with the loss of PriA (18Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6933-6940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, the helicase activity may be important in a direct, non-recombinogenic form of replication restart. To load DnaB to the lagging strand template of a fork for restart, at least 20 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA is required at the branch point (19Jezewska M.J. Kim U.S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On model forks with insufficient single-stranded DNA, PriA was shown to unwind the nascent lagging strand, generating a structure conducive to restart (20Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This form of restart was proposed to act in concert with the branch migration protein RecG (21McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 2000; 101: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). If replication restart is absolutely essential for cell survival, then PriA-independent restart mechanisms must exist, because the elimination of PriA, although harmful to the cell, is not lethal (22Nurse P. Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6686-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lee E.H. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3029-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Disruption of the genes encoding either PriC or Rep led to inviability in the absence of PriA (24Sandler S.J. Genetics. 2000; 155: 487-497PubMed Google Scholar), implicating at least these two proteins in the PriA-independent pathway. In support of the model for multiple restart pathways, strains lacking both PriA and PriB, or PriC and Rep remain viable because the other pathway can compensate in each case. The mechanism for PriA- and PriB-dependent restart has been well characterized, but the restart pathway involving Rep and PriC is less understood. Furthermore, genetic evidence indicates the presence of a third restart pathway, about which little is known, that involves both PriA and PriC. We have recently reported evidence that PriC has the capability to load DnaB and restart replication on specific fork structures in reactions that are distinct from the PriA- and PriB-dependent system (25Heller R.C. Marians K.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, in those studies, because Rep was not required in the reactions, its contribution toward replication restart could not be elucidated. Like PriA, Rep exhibits 3′ → 5′ DNA helicase activity (26Yarranton G.T. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and also plays a role in the replication of the φX174 chromosome (27Scott J.F. Eisenberg S. Bertsch L.L. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although the processivity of Rep helicase activity is rather low on its own, it has the ability to displace bound proteins from the DNA template (28Yancey-Wrona J.E. Matson S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6713-6721Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The rep mutant was reported to have a slower rate of replication fork movement, about 50-60% that of wild-type cells (29Lane H.E. Denhardt D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 97: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Consequently, cells are larger, contain more DNA, and have more replication forks per cell (30Lane H.E. Denhardt D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 120: 805-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In combination with recB or recC disruptions, the rep mutant is inviable (31Uzest M. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1177-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting an increased frequency of double-strand breaks. Indeed, the rep mutant does accumulate linear DNA when temperature-sensitive RecB and RecC are inactivated by high temperature (32Michel B. Ehrlich S.D. Uzest M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). One explanation is that frequent replication pauses occur in the absence of Rep, perhaps because of an inability to remove blocking proteins, which leads to chromosome breakage. In this report, we describe how Rep participates in the direct, PriA-independent rescue of stalled replication forks and the role of the helicase activities of Rep and PriA in the restart process. In the Rep-PriC pathway, the latter protein plays a crucial, multifunctional role by loading both Rep and DnaB to branched structures. Both Rep and PriA have the ability to unwind nascent lagging strand DNA at the fork branch point, activities that are focused to the proper template strand by the presence of SSB. The newly single-stranded template is then utilized by PriC to load DnaB, which nucleates replisome reassembly and provides the replicative helicase activity. Thus the Rep-PriC and PriA-PriC pathways of replication restart exhibit similar properties and are likely to act at stalled forks where a blockage of leading strand synthesis has allowed the 5′-end of the nascent lagging strand to progress further along the template than the 3′-end of the nascent leading strand. DNA and Protein—The restart primosomal proteins PriA, PriC, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaG were all expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (33Marians K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides (oligos) were obtained from GeneLink. The forked, linear DNA template was prepared as described previously (25Heller R.C. Marians K.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The Rep open reading frame was amplified by PCR from E. coli W3110 genomic DNA using a forward primer with the sequence 5′-CGGCGGCGCATATGCGTCTAAACCCCGGCCAAC-3′, and a reverse primer with the sequence 5′-GCCGCCGGATCCTTATTTCCCTCGTTTTGCCGCC-3′, and ligated into NdeI- and BamHI-digested pET-21a (Novagen) to create pRH72. Rep was purified from soluble extracts of BL21(DE3)(pLysS)(pRH72) by sequential chromatography on Q-Sepharose, Bio-Rex 70, single-stranded DNA cellulose, and hydroxylapatite, a combination and modification of previously published procedures (34Scott J.F.

The fork substrates used in unwinding assays were prepared with the following oligos: (i) 1b-98, 5′-GCAAGCCTTCTACAGGTCGACCGTCCATGGCGACTCGAGACCGCAATACGGATAAGGGCTGAGCACGCCGACGAACATTCACCACGCCAGACCACGTA-3′; (ii) 3L-98, 5′-GACTATCTACGTCCGAGGCTCGCGCCGCAGACTCATTTAGCCCTTATCCGTATTGCGGTCTCGAGTCGCCATGGACGGTCGACCTGTAGAAGGCTTGC-3′; (iii) 11b-38, 5′-TACGTGGTCTGGCGTGGTGAATGTTCGTCGGCGTGCTC-3′; (iv) B-33, 5′-AGTCTGCGGCGCGAGCCTCGGACGTAGATAGTC-3′. The basic fork is composed of oligos 1b-98 and 3L-98; to this, the leading strand oligo 11b-38 or the lagging strand oligo B-33 was annealed to the fork or omitted, as noted. All fork substrates were 5′-end-labeled on 3L-98 using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. An excess (1.5-fold) of unlabeled oligos were mixed with the labeled oligo, annealed and then the completed fork structure was purified by electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels as described previously (12Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fork Unwinding Assays—Reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 4 mm MgOAc2, 1 nm DNA substrate, and 125 nm SSB where indicated, were preincubated at 25 °C for 3 min. Reactions were started by addition of the indicated concentrations of Rep, PriC, PriA, DnaB, and DnaC, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, unless otherwise noted. Unwinding was terminated by addition of EDTA, SDS, and proteinase K to 20 mm, 0.5%, and 0.2 mg/ml, respectively, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis at 17 V/cm for 1 h through a 10% polyacrylamide gel (30:1, acrylamide to bisacrylamide) using 100 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA as the electrophoresis buffer. The gel was fixed by soaking in 10% methanol, 7% HOAc, 5% glycerol, dried, exposed to a phosphorimager screen, and then autoradiographed. The fraction of intact substrate and unwound product bands were quantitated using a phosphorimager. Replication Restart Reactions—Replication restart reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), MgOAc2 (5.5 mm for Rep-PriC reactions and 8 mm for PriA-PriC reactions), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, ATP (0.5 mm for Rep-PriC reactions and 1 mm for PriA-PriC reactions), 200 μm NTPs, 40 μm [α-32P]dATP (4000-5000 cpm/pmol), 40 μm dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP, 1nm linear, forked template DNA, 20 nm Pol III*, 30 nm β subunit of the HE, 250 nm SSB, Rep, and the primosomal proteins as indicated were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. When present, PriA was at 32 nm (except when varied as indicated), Rep was at 200 nm (except when varied as indicated), PriC was at 320 nm, DnaB was at 60 nm, DnaC was at 400 nm, and DnaG was at 300 nm. DNA synthesis was terminated by the addition of EDTA to 33 mm. Total DNA synthesis was determined by assaying an aliquot of the reaction mixture for acid-insoluble radioactivity. Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by adding one-fifth volume of a loading dye mixture containing 150 mm NaOH, 10 mm EDTA, 6% sucrose, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. DNA products were analyzed by alkaline gel electrophoresis through a 0.8% agarose gel at 2 V/cm for 15.5 h using 30 mm NaOH and 2 mm EDTA as the electrophoresis buffer. For DNA size reference, a 5′-[32P]-1 kb ladder (NEB) was analyzed alongside the samples. Gels were neutralized with 5% trichloroacetic acid, dried, exposed to a phosphorimager screen, and then autoradiographed. PriC Stimulates Rep, but Not PriA, Helicase Activity—In considering the relationship between Rep and PriC, we asked whether PriC affected Rep helicase activity. When these analyses were conducted using partial duplex DNA substrates, no effect of PriC was detected (data not shown), however, when forked duplex substrates were used, PriC had a significant stimulatory effect (Fig. 1). The framework of the forked helicase substrates used in these experiments has been described previously (25Heller R.C. Marians K.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The substrates are composed of two 98 nucleotide (nt)-long oligos. Annealing the two oligos generates a 60 bp duplex DNA with one blunt end and the other end consisting of two non-complementary, 38-nt long single-stranded tails. Various complementary oligos can be annealed to the single-stranded tails to represent the nascent leading and lagging strands at stalled replication forks. Alone, Rep exhibited weak activity on a forked substrate that had no oligos representing nascent DNA annealed to it; however, in the presence of PriC, unwinding activity was stimulated ∼6-fold (Fig. 1A). The DNA substrate is relatively small, so the stimulation of activity most likely represents an increase in Rep loading efficiency, although whether PriC also increases the processivity of Rep cannot be determined by this assay. During rolling circle DNA synthesis of the bacteriophage φX174, an interaction between Rep and the phage-encoded gene A protein at the replication fork enables Rep to accomplish processive unwinding of the duplex DNA of the phage chromosome (27Scott J.F. Eisenberg S. Bertsch L.L. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 37Arai N. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5294-5298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our finding that PriC facilitates duplex unwinding by Rep, it is possible that PriC represents a cellular analog of the gene A protein. At a fixed concentration of Rep, introducing increased concentrations of PriC caused unwinding to increase, but stimulation exhibited a threshold effect (Fig. 1B). At low concentrations of PriC, activity was barely increased, but at higher PriC concentrations, activity increased rapidly, resulting in a sigmoidal titration curve. Whether this indicates cooperativity in binding between multiple PriC monomers and DNA or Rep is unclear at this time. In a previous report, a Rep helicase stimulatory protein was purified from E. coli cell extract (38Smith K.R. Yancey J.E. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6119-6126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like PriC, this protein was small and basic, stimulated unwinding activity with a pronounced sigmoidicity, and maximal stimulation was observed at a protein: DNA ratio of over 350. Because this stimulatory factor shares so many characteristics in common with PriC, they are likely to be the same protein. This stimulatory activity of PriC was specific for Rep. No stimulation of PriA helicase activity could be observed (Fig. 1C). The Presence of a Nascent Leading Strand and of SSB Modulates Rep and PriA Helicase Activities at Forked DNA Structures—Whereas the functional biochemical interaction between Rep and PriC indicated by the experiments described in Fig. 1 was consistent with the genetic observations, the helicase activity manifest was inconsistent with replication fork restart. It seemed unlikely that the unwinding of the template strands described would be productive. Rep cannot couple with the Pol III HE in the absence of the φX174 gene A protein and, unlike DnaB, exhibits no interaction with the primase. Such promiscuous unwinding of the template strands in the absence of replisome formation is sure to be deleterious. Under normal circumstances, DnaB is prevented from loading onto single-stranded DNA that is coated with SSB (2LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our previous observations that PriC was involved in a DnaB loading system that could overcome the SSB inhibition at stalled replication forks containing gaps in the leading strand (25Heller R.C. Marians K.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and that Rep helicase activity appeared to be important for restart, we hypothesized that a more productive role at a stalled replication fork for a non-replicative helicase such as Rep would be to modulate the structure of the fork by unwinding an obstructing DNA strand on the lagging strand template. Such an activity had already been ascribed to PriA (39Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When incubated with a forked substrate carrying a lagging strand oligo that was shortened from the 5′-end, leaving a 5-nt gap between it and the template branch point (this gap was used in order to be able to compare Rep and PriA action, it is required for PriA unwinding of the nascent lagging strand (data not shown and Ref. 39Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)), Rep could unwind both the template strands (fork unwinding) and the duplex formed by the lagging strand template and the nascent lagging strand (Fig. 2A). The former activity is similar to that described in Fig. 1; however, note that in the absence of PriC a 5-fold higher concentration of Rep was required to sustain the same extent of unwinding (compare the Rep titration in the presence of PriC shown in Fig. 1A to the Rep titration in the absence of PriC shown in Fig. 2A). However, the persistence of the fork unwinding activity was still troubling. We therefore searched for elements that would act to modulate this unwinding activity by examining the influence of both the presence of a nascent leading strand and of SSB, elements likely to be present at a significant fraction of stalled fork structures. The presence of either a nascent leading strand or SSB suppressed the fork unwinding activity of Rep (Fig. 2, B-D). Both elements presumably act by the same mechanism, i.e. preventing access of Rep to the leading strand template. The ability of Rep to bind the forked substrates in the presence of SSB suggests that this protein, like PriA, possesses structure-specific DNA recognition. This is consistent with our observation that Rep can bind D-loop DNA specifically, even in the presence of SSB. 3K. J. Marians, unpublished data. These data indicate that the Rep helicase activity will be directed to unwind the nascent lagging strand at stalled replication forks, irrespective of the disposition of the nascent leading strand. Given the similarities between the Rep and PriA helicase activities, we asked whether the same was true for PriA. Unlike Rep, PriA did not exhibit any fork unwinding activity (Fig. 3). However, also unlike Rep, when a nascent leading strand was present at the fork, unwinding of the nascent lagging strand was suppressed (Fig. 3, A-C). This suppression was reversed by the presence of SSB (Fig. 3, D-F). In this case, we surmise that SSB acts to partially denature the branch point region, allowing PriA to gain access to the lagging strand template after recognition of the branched structure. Thus, SSB plays a critical role in ensuring that at stalled replication forks the helicase activities of Rep and PriA are applied in a fashion that will assist restart: to obviate a potentially inhibitory situation where access of DnaB to the lagging strand template is prevented. As described in the following sections, we proceeded to examine the complete mechanism of replication restart under such conditions. The observed PriA-catalyzed unwinding of the nascent lagging strand is consistent with a previous demonstration using similar structures formed during bacteriophage Mu DNA replication (39Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, unlike Jones and Nakai (39Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we find that in the presence of SSB unwinding of the lagging strand by PriA occurs equally well whether or not the fork contains a leading strand (Fig. 3, D-F). We investigated this apparent discrepancy (supplemental Fig. S1). Under our conditions in the presence of SSB, the presence of a leading strand does not inhibit PriA unwinding of the lagging strand. In order to observe the inhibition observed by Jones and Nakai (39Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we had to use their experimental conditions, which included the opposite order of addition that we use. Jones and Nakai were adding PriA first and then SSB. When we do so we can observe the inhibition, although only if there is a 5-nt gap in the leading strand. This gap was used in the experiments of Jones and Nakai because it is present at the bacteriophage Mu fork. We consider our conditions to be more representative of those extant in the cell then those of Jones and Nakai, because SSB will always be present at stalled forks before they are recognized by any restart system. Rep and PriA Unwind the Nascent Lagging Strand at Stalled Replication Forks—Helicase assays were performed in the presence of SSB to determine how the presence of a nascent lagging strand affects the PriC system for DnaB loading. For these reactions, using synthetic oligos we modeled a stalled fork in which lagging strand DNA synthesis had progressed past leading strand synthesis. The leading strand oligo was omitted from the fork in order to model a large gap, and a lagging strand oligo was annealed near to the branch point to represent the continued nascent lagging strand DNA synthesis. (This is the same substrate used in Figs. 2, A and B and 3, A and D and is used here to maximize PriC-directed DnaB-loading activity, which is inhibited by the presence of a nascent leading strand that does not contain a sizable gap between its 3′-end and the fork branch point, as with the substrates used in Figs. 2, C and D and 3, B and E (25Heller R.C. Marians K.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).) As expected, incubation with PriC or DnaB/C alone did not produce any unwinding products because the requirements for the PriC-dependent loading system were not met (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5). However, even incubation with PriC, DnaB, and DnaC together did not produce any unwinding product (lane 8). Because of the presence of the nascent lagging strand DNA, DnaB loading to this fork required an additional factor, either Rep or PriA, although targeting of these latter two proteins to the forked structures occurred by different mechanisms: PriA could recognize the branched structure independently, whereas Rep loading was mediated by PriC. Incubation of the fork with Rep alone produced a limited amount of product, and PriC was found to stimulate the observed unwinding (lanes 3 and 6), consistent with the results reported above (Fig. 1). Interestingly, only one unwinding product was observed from this SSB-coated model fork containing a lagging strand oligo. The nascent lagging strand was unwound exclusively, whereas the parental duplex was left intact. On the other hand, PriA bound the substrate and unwound the lagging strand equally well in either the presence or absence of PriC (lanes 10 and 11). Unwinding of the nascent lagging strand oligo provided a single stranded template for the loading of DnaB to the fork by PriC when all components were present: PriC, DnaB, and DnaC, in the presence of either PriA or Rep. Only under these conditions was DnaB loaded to the lagging strand template and able to use its 5′→3′ helicase activity to unwind the parental duplex (Fig. 4, lane 9 for Rep and lane 13 for PriA). The loading of DnaB to such a stalled replication fork should be sufficient to reassemble the replisome and allow replication to proceed. To test this supposition, we reconstituted the Rep-PriC and PriA-PriC replication restart reactions. Reconstitution of Replication Restart Mediated by the Rep-PriC and PriA-PriC Pathways—We have described previously a long linear forked template that we used to model replication restart at a stalled replication fork (25Heller R.C. Marians K.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The template is blunt-ended on one side, contains 6.9 kb of duplex DNA, and has two 38-nucleotide noncomplementary arms on the other end. The advantage of this template is that oligos of different lengths can be annealed to its arms, thereby modeling the structures of different types of stalled replication forks.

Several hypotheses have been raised as to the potential role(s) of the primary cilium in cell function, ranging from vestigial appendage with no apparent function, to a potentially relevant role in the cell cycle, as it is derived from the centriole (2Pazour G.J. Witman G.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Primary cilia arise from the centrioles that organize the mitotic spindle (16Rieder C.L. Jensen C.G. Jensen L.C. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1979; 68: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and their expression is highly cell cycle-dependent. Cilia are most abundant in non-proliferating G0 cells and can often be found in cells during interphase. Cilia assemble in G1 until spindle formation is initiated by centriole separation (16Rieder C.L. Jensen C.G. Jensen L.C. J. Ultrastruct.

Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E.H. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). It is thus speculated that the Ca2+ influx signals initiated by cilia transduction may be the initial step in cell activation, including cell replication and differentiation. How this long and narrow organelle behaves as a signal transducer is still unknown. Previous studies in sensory cilia, would indicate, however, that channel activity in ciliary membranes may be an important factor in its sensory function (19Frings S. Lindemann B. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1091-1094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this report we provide the first direct evidence for the presence of various channels phenotypes in nonmotile primary cilia of LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells. Ciliary channel density is much higher than plasma membrane channel activity, suggesting an electrical phenomenon, where depolarization of this organelle, with respect to the cytoplasm, may contribute to its sensory function. Isolation of Cilia from LLC-PK1 Cells—Wild type LLC-PK1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, as reported (20Raychowdhury M.K. Ibarra C. Damiano A. Jackson Jr, G.R. Smith G.R. McLaughlin P.R. Prat A.G. Ausiello D.A. Lader A.S. Cantiello H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20137-20146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Primary cilia from LLC-PK1 cells were isolated as follows. Confluent monolayers (2-3 weeks) were scraped with Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 5 min at 52 × g. The cell pellet was suspended in a high Ca2+ “deciliation” solution containing 112 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. Resuspended cells were shaken in this solution for 10 min at 4 °C. Ciliary membranes were separated by centrifugation at 7,700 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was loaded on top of a 45% sucrose solution in high Ca2+ saline solution and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The sucrose-supernatant interface band was collected and diluted (1:10) and centrifuged again for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in normal saline solution, pH 7.0, and supplemented with 2.0 mm EGTA and 0.5 mm sucrose. Samples were aliquotted and stored at -80 °C until further use. Plasma membranes from confluent LLC-PK1 cells were obtained as reported (20Raychowdhury M.K. Ibarra C. Damiano A. Jackson Jr, G.R. Smith G.R. McLaughlin P.R. Prat A.G. Ausiello D.A. Lader A.S. Cantiello H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20137-20146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A 50-fold higher protein content in the plasma membranes compared with the isolated cilia (1160 ± 190 μg/ml versus 15.8 ± 4.64 μg/ml, p < 0.004, n = 3) was observed by the method of Lowry. Immunochemistry—Confluent cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) and 2% sucrose, for 10 min. Cells were rinsed three times with phosphate buffer solution and permeabilized with either 0.1% Triton X-100 or 1% Nonidet P-40. Some cells were immunolabeled without permeabilization. Cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin or Image-it (MP) for 30 min prior to exposure to the primary antibody. Cells were immunolabeled with anti-acetylated α-tubulin antibody (mAb, Sigma) at concentrations of 2.8 μg/ml of stock solution. The polyclonal anti-PC2 antibody (0.2 mg/ml stock) was obtained from PolyFast™ (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The TRPC1 antibody (1:200 dilution from 0.3 mg/ml stock, Sigma) is from rabbit against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 557-571 of human TRPC1. The anti-rat α-epithelial sodium channel antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Tom Kleyman. A goat anti-rabbit secondary Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes) antibody was used at 2 μg/ml. Electron Microscopy—Isolated cilia were fixed in a solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde and Na+cacodylate. Samples were with the buffer, spun down at 90,000 × g in a TL 100 ultracentrifuge for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was stained for 2 h at room temperature with 2% OsO4. Conversely, aliquots (10 μl) were placed on a gold grid, wicked off with Whatman paper (#5), and negatively stained for 10 s with 2% phosphotungstic acid. Samples were observed with a Phillips CM10 electron microscope at 80 kV. Electrophysiology of Isolated Cilia—Cilium-attached patches were obtained from isolated cilia. Currents and command voltages were obtained with a Dagan 3900 patch clamp amplifier (Dagan Corp.) under voltage clamp configuration with leak subtraction adjustments. Ion channel reconstitution of ciliary membranes was conducted as reported for other membranes (21González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Ntal. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, isolated cilia were mixed and sonicated in the lipid mix (21González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Ntal. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) prior to reconstitution in a lipid bilayer system. All electrical signals were filtered at 5 kHz with the internal four-pole Bessel filter (Dagan Corp.). Data were first analyzed with PClamp 6.0.3 (Axon Instruments), and the basal line of current records was manually corrected with Clampfit 8.0. The patch pipette was filled with a solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with N-methylglucamine. The bathing solution contained an identical solution, and whenever indicated it was replaced with a solution containing 145 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with N-methylglucamine. EGTA was added from a 100 mm stock solution. The patches were intrinsically leaky, which constrains their analyses (22Stühmer W. Roberts W.S. Almers W. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1983: 123-132Google Scholar, 23Roberts W.M. Almers W. Rudy B. Iverson L.E. Ion Channels. 207. Academic Press Inc., New York1992: 155-176Google Scholar). Thus, the following restrictions apply to the data. Current records were only obtained under a given set of solutions, after offsetting tip potential to “zero current” in the absence of leak subtraction. This procedure was repeated each time that a solution was changed. Changes in baseline currents after experimental procedures prevented quantification. Thus, only identification of channel levels was considered relevant. Identification and Isolation of Primary Cilia from LLC-PK1 Cells—The expression of primary cilia in LLC-PK1 cells was determined by acetylatedtubulin immunocytochemical labeling, most particularly in fluid-filled domes and spontaneously formed cysts (Fig. 1a). Most cells contained identifiable cilia as a prominent thick bud and/or more elongated structures in all stages of growth. Primary cilia were detected in cells lining the wall of transporting domes (Fig. 1b). A closer look at cellular localization indicated a clear development toward the side of the nucleus (Fig. 1c). Some cilia extended several micrometers from the apical membrane, which had the distinctive fragmented pattern of acetylated tubulin (Fig. 1d). Primary cilia from confluent LLC-PK1 cells were isolated with a technique adapted from previous reports (24Jorquera O. Latorre R. Labarca P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1235-C1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Delgado R. Saavedra M.V. Schmachtenberg O. Sierralta J. Bacigalupo J. J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 2022-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent LLC-PK1 cells were deciliated by a quick exposure to a high Ca2+ solution and concentrated in a sucrose density gradient. Isolated cilia were identified after fixation and immunolabeling with anti-acetylated tubulin antibody (Fig. 2a). Isolated cilia were further visualized and identified at higher resolution (×25,000) by electron microscopy (Fig. 2b) where ciliary stems and tips can be identified as reported (26Mitchell K.A.P. Gallagher B.C. Szabo G. Otero A.d. S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 59: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Experimental approach to acquiring electrical information from primary cilia. a, isolated primary cilia from LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells were obtained with a cell deciliation procedure as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Isolated cilia were visualized by immunocytochemistry at ×100 magnification after fixation and labeling with anti-acetylated tubulin antibody. b, electron micrograph of isolated cilia. Arrowheads and arrows indicate cilia and cilia tip structures, respectively, consistent with previous reports (26Mitchell K.A.P. Gallagher B.C. Szabo G. Otero A.d. S. Cell Motil.

Right panels detail cilia and tips. c, the patch pipette was approached under lower magnification (×40) and then switched to higher magnification (d, ×60). e, suction of the cilium to the patch pipette increased the tip resistance, which further increased by leak subtraction with the patch clamp amplifier.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Patch Clamping of Isolated Cilia—To obtain direct electrophysiological information, isolated cilia were identified under oil phase contrast (×100) in saline solution, and after location, further visualized at lower resolution (×40) to place the patch pipette in the proximity of the isolated cilium (Fig. 2, c and d). Tip resistance was followed by applying 1-mV square pulses before and after suction of the patch pipette against the isolated cilium (Fig. 2e). Most frequently, the resistance increased after touching, indicating that vacuum suction was sufficient to produce a “leaky patch.” “Leak subtraction” compensation followed with the patch clamp amplifier. Despite the intrinsic “leakiness” of the patches, channel activity was clearly observed under spontaneous conditions (n = 22/22, Fig. 3a). The most frequent ion channel observed (Fig. 3, a-d) had a single channel conductance of 83.6 ± 1.0 pS (n = 3) in symmetrical NaCl. Replacement of the bathing solution with either Na+-aspartate (71.5 ± 1.47 pS, Fig. 3d) or KCl (73.2 ± 1.58 pS, Fig. 3d) did not largely modify the single conductance, reversal potential, or rectification properties, suggesting its activity as a non-selective cation channel. Another non-selective cation channel phenotype with a single channel conductance of 173 ± 4.40 pS (n = 3) was observed in the primary cilium (Fig. 3d, inset). Whether this channel phenotype represents a “dimer” of the 83-pS channel is currently unknown. Further, a small Na+-permeable channel (8.07 ± 0.50 pS, n = 3) was also observed after the addition of AVP (10 μm, Fig. 3, e and f). The presence of V2R vasopressin receptors is being currently explored and would suggest that a local second messenger pathway is present in isolated primary cilia (to report elsewhere). Interestingly, addition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (50 nm) and MgATP (3-6 mm) also increased cation channel activity (Fig. 3g). This suggests that vasopressin acts on a V2R, instead of a V1R-type of response. However, we do not presently know how the enzyme reaches the intraciliary compartment. It is likely, however, that both the leaky and openended nature of the isolated cilium help diffuse the drugs in place. Channel function was inhibited by addition of amiloride (5 μm, n = 4, Fig. 3h). Reconstitution of Isolated Cilia—Ciliary membrane channels were also observed by reconstitution in a lipid bilayer system (Fig. 3, i and j) in the presence of a Na+gradient (150 versus 15 mm, in cis and trans compartment, respectively). Channels were observed in 297 of 303 ciliary membranes. The most frequent cation-selective channel had a single channel conductance of 156 pS, which was inhibited by an anti-PC2 antibody (Fig. 3i). Reconstituted ciliary membranes seldom displayed 75-pS Cl--permeable channels (3/303, Fig. 3j), explaining why it was not observed in cilium-attached patches. The data indicate, however, that abundant cation-permeable channel activity is present in the ciliary membranes. A comparison of reconstituted ciliary versus plasma membranes, indicated as much as 400-fold higher channel activity in ciliary membranes as averaged mean currents were divided by protein content (Fig. 3k). Presence of Channel Proteins in the Primary Cilium—To begin an identification of the channel proteins contributing to the electrical activity of the primary cilium in renal epithelial cells immunolocalization was conducted in isolated cilia identified by co-labeling with acetylated tubulin. Several ion channels were identified in primary cilia. The TRP-type channels TRPC1 and polycystin-2 (TRPP2) were immunodetected in the primary cilia of confluent LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 4) and also isolated cilia (data not shown). Interestingly, the epithelial Na+channel subunit α-epithelial sodium channel was also observed lining the entire surface of the primary cilium (Fig. 4b). The presence of several channel species is in agreement with the high electrodifussional permeability observed in the primary cilium, with respect to the plasma membrane. Recent evidence indicates that renal epithelial cells may sense environmental forces by mechanosensory activity of the primary cilium (4Praetorius H.A. Spring K.R. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 15Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E.H. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Little is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms associated with sensory function of renal primary cilia. Electrical activity in this organelle, mediated by functional ion channels, may be an important contributor to this sensory function. Among the most studied ciliary membranes are those from sensory neurons of the olfactory bulb (27Labarca P. Bacigalupo J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1988; 20: 551-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Frings S. Lindemann B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29Nakamura T. Lee H.H.

Neuron. 2003; 37: 639-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and sensory cilia of ciliated invertebrates (31Fujiwara C. Anzai K. Kirino Y. Nagao S. Nozawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 32Fujiwara-Hirashima C. Anzai K. Takahashi M. Kirino Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The reconstitution of olfactory ciliary membranes in planar lipid bilayers originally conducted by Ehrlich et al. (33Ehrlich B.E. Finkelstein A. Forte M. Kung C. Science. 1984; 225: 427-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels from Paramecium cilia. Reconstitution of ciliary membranes from wild type and mutant Tetrahymena thermophila also showed the presence of other cation channels (31Fujiwara C. Anzai K. Kirino Y. Nagao S. Nozawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 34Oosawa Y. Sokabe M. Kasai M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Reconstituted sensory ciliary membranes have also allowed identification of signaling mechanisms involved in ciliary channel regulation. Labarca et al. (35Labarca P. Simon S.A. Anholt R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 944-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) observed that ion channels from reconstituted ciliary membranes of the Rana catesbeiana olfactory epithelium, are sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of odorant ligands. This may have been one of the first demonstrations of TRP vanilloid receptor-type functional channels in cilia. Cyclic AMP activated the 23-pS cation channels in vertebrate olfactory cilia (24Jorquera O. Latorre R. Labarca P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1235-C1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and modulated a high conductance K+ channel, displaying several open substates with conductances of 34, 80, and 130 pS (24Jorquera O. Latorre R. Labarca P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1235-C1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is highly reminiscent of PC2 function (21González-Perrett S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Ntal. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The presence of cAMP-activated 8 pS chloride channels has also been determined by steady-state noise analysis of ligand-induced currents (36Larsson H.P. Kleene S.J. Lecar H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1193-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Sensory cilia membranes also contain inositol 3-phosphate-gated channels (37Honda E. Teeter J.H. Restrepo D. Brain Res. 1995; 703: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In that study, two types of non-selective cation channels were observed by current fluctuations in rat olfactory cilia membranes fused onto phospholipid bilayers. Direct electrical information from sensory cilia in situ was obtained by Frings and Lindemann (19Frings S. Lindemann B. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1091-1094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), who conducted highly demanding studies to determine the biophysical properties and regulation of ionic conductances in cilia from frog olfactory bulb. The authors managed to pull sensory cilia from olfactory receptor cells into a patch pipette. Despite the fact that the pipette did not form a tight electrical seal with the ciliary membrane, transient record currents driven by action potentials arising from the olfactory neuron were collected. With this method, odorant thresholds in the picomolar range were obtained (19Frings S. Lindemann B. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1091-1094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), indicating that ligand affinity is much higher in situ than with reconstituted preparations. This finding also suggests that, however difficult, these experiments may provide more reliable information not available by other methods (28Frings S. Lindemann B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 38Frings S. Benz S. Lindemann B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 725-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The encompassed evidence suggests an abundance of ion channels in sensory cilia. Several G protein receptors, including those for somatostatin and serotonin have also been found in primary cilia of brain neurons (13Handel M. Schulz S. Stanarius A. Schreff M. Erdtmann-Vourliotis H. Schmidt H. Wolf G. Hollt V. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 909-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 14Brailov I. Bancila M. Brisorgueil M. Miquel M. Hamon M. Verge D. Brain Res. 2000; 872: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus sensory function in cilia is intrinsically related to the presence of functional channels in these membranes. To date, no information is available on either membrane receptors and/or ion channel activity in primary cilia from renal epithelial cells. Recent studies indicate, however, that the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease gene products PC1 and PC2, a novel TRP channel member (TRPP2), are present in the primary cilia of renal epithelial cells (7Yoder B.K. Hou X. Guay-Woodford L.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2508-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 9Pazour G.J. San Agustin J.T. Follit J.A. Rosenbaum J.L. Witman G.B. Curr.

Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). A functional interaction between the two may seem central to environmental cell signaling events leading to Ca2+ transport regulation and subsequent cell signaling (15Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E.H. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). In the present study we described a method to acquire single channel data from isolated primary cilia and provided the first direct evidence for the presence of functional channels in the membrane coating the primary cilium of renal epithelial cells. At least three cation-selective channel phenotypes were observed, although the ∼80-pS cation-selective channel may be the most prevalent subconductance state of a large channel as observed in both ciliary patches and reconstituted membranes. The present data are in agreement with the presence of TRP-type channel activity in primary cilia from renal epithelial cells. An ability to patch and identify single channel currents in these narrow organelles may likely lie in the fact that the process of isolation swells the cilia to dimensions where the membrane area is large enough to interact with the patch pipette. Cation channel in primary cilia of renal epithelial cells may help maintain this compartment depolarized with respect to the cytoplasm of the cell, as depicted in the hypothetical model of ciliary function (Fig. 4c). The presence of a cAMP response is consistent with the presence of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase-regulated α-epithelial sodium channel protein in this organelle. This also is in agreement with data obtained in voltage-clamped sensory cilia (36Larsson H.P. Kleene S.J. Lecar H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1193-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the presence G protein receptors, such as those for somatostatin and serotonin in the cilia of brain neurons (13Handel M. Schulz S. Stanarius A. Schreff M. Erdtmann-Vourliotis H. Schmidt H. Wolf G. Hollt V. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 909-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 14Brailov I. Bancila M. Brisorgueil M. Miquel M. Hamon M. Verge D. Brain Res. 2000; 872: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus high intrinsic cation channel activity in non-motile primary cilia of renal epithelial cells may contribute to the sensory properties of this organelle.

https://openalex.org/W1988682256,"Peroxynitrite is a potent oxidant and nitrating species proposed as a direct effector of myocardial damage in numerous cardiac pathologies. Whether peroxynitrite also acts indirectly, by modulating cell signal transduction in the myocardium, has not been investigated. Therefore, we examined a possible role for peroxynitrite on the activation of NF-kappaB, a crucial pro-inflammatory transcription factor, in cultured H9C2 cardiomyocytes. H9C2 cells were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha or lipopolysaccharide following a brief (20-min) exposure to peroxynitrite. NF-kappaB activation (phosphorylation and degradation of its inhibitor IkappaBalpha, nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65, and NF-kappaB DNA binding) triggered by lipopolysaccharide or tumor necrosis factor-alpha was abrogated by peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite also inhibited NF-kappaB in two human endothelial cell lines activated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1beta. These effects were related to oxidative but not nitrative chemistry and were still being observed while nitration was suppressed by epicatechin. The mechanism of NF-kappaB inhibition by peroxynitrite was a complete blockade of phosphorylation and activation of the upstream kinase IkappaB kinase (IKK) beta, required for canonical, pro-inflammatory NF-kappaB activation. At the same time, peroxynitrite activated phosphorylation of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase and IKKalpha, considered as part of an alternative, noncanonical NF-kappaB activation pathway. Suppression of IKKbeta-dependent NF-kappaB activation translated into a marked inhibition of the transcription of NF-kappaB-dependent genes by peroxynitrite. Thus, peroxynitrite has a dual effect on NF-kappaB, inhibiting canonical IKKbeta-dependent NF-kappaB activation while activating NF-kappaB-inducing kinase and IKKalpha phosphorylation, which suggests its involvement in an alternative pathway of NF-kappaB activation. These findings offer new perspectives for the understanding of the relationships between redox stress and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2048841770,"H-, N-, and K-Ras are isoforms of Ras proteins, which undergo different lipid modifications at the C terminus. These post-translational events make possible the association of Ras proteins both with the inner plasma membrane and to the cytosolic surface of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, which is also required for the proper function of these proteins. To better characterize the intracellular distribution and sorting of Ras proteins, constructs were engineered to express the C-terminal domain of H- and K-Ras fused to variants of green fluorescent protein. Using confocal microscopy, we found in CHO-K1 cells that H-Ras, which is palmitoylated and farnesylated, localized at the recycling endosome in addition to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. In contrast, K-Ras, which is farnesylated and nonpalmitoylated, mainly localized at the plasma membrane. Moreover, we demonstrate that sorting signals of H- and K-Ras are contained within the C-terminal domain of these proteins and that palmitoylation on this region of H-Ras might operate as a dominant sorting signal for proper subcellular localization of this protein in CHO-K1 cells. Using selective photobleaching techniques, we demonstrate the dynamic nature of H-Ras trafficking to the recycling endosome from plasma membrane. We also provide evidence that Rab5 and Rab11 activities are required for proper delivery of H-Ras to the endocytic recycling compartment. Using a chimera containing the Ras binding domain of c-Raf-1 fused to a fluorescent protein, we found that a pool of GTP-bound H-Ras localized on membranes from Rab11-positive recycling endosome after serum stimulation. These results suggest that H-Ras present in membranes of the recycling endosome might be activating signal cascades essential for the dynamic and function of the organelle."
https://openalex.org/W2058503211,"The regulatory domain of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) contains three membrane-targeting modules, two C1 domains (C1A and C1B) that bind diacylglycerol and phorbol ester, and the C2 domain that is responsible for the Ca2+-dependent membrane binding. Accumulating evidence suggests that C1A and C2 domains of PKCα are tethered in the resting state and that the tethering is released upon binding to the membrane containing phosphatidylserine. The homology modeling and the docking analysis of C1A and C2 domains of PKCα revealed a highly complementary interface that comprises Asp55-Arg252 and Arg42-Glu282 ion pairs and a Phe72-Phe255 aromatic pair. Mutations of these residues in the predicted C1A-C2 interface showed large effects on in vitro membrane binding, enzyme activity, phosphatidylserine selectivity, and cellular membrane translocation of PKCα, supporting their involvement in interdomain interactions. In particular, D55A (or D55K) and R252A (or R252E) mutants showed much higher basal membrane affinity and enzyme activity and faster subcellular translocation than wild type, whereas a double charge-reversal mutant (D55K/R252E) behaved analogously to wild type, indicating that a direct electrostatic interaction between the two residues is essential for the C1A-C2 tethering. Collectively, these studies provide new structural insight into PKCα C1A-C2 interdomain interactions and the mechanism of lipid-mediated PKCα activation. The regulatory domain of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) contains three membrane-targeting modules, two C1 domains (C1A and C1B) that bind diacylglycerol and phorbol ester, and the C2 domain that is responsible for the Ca2+-dependent membrane binding. Accumulating evidence suggests that C1A and C2 domains of PKCα are tethered in the resting state and that the tethering is released upon binding to the membrane containing phosphatidylserine. The homology modeling and the docking analysis of C1A and C2 domains of PKCα revealed a highly complementary interface that comprises Asp55-Arg252 and Arg42-Glu282 ion pairs and a Phe72-Phe255 aromatic pair. Mutations of these residues in the predicted C1A-C2 interface showed large effects on in vitro membrane binding, enzyme activity, phosphatidylserine selectivity, and cellular membrane translocation of PKCα, supporting their involvement in interdomain interactions. In particular, D55A (or D55K) and R252A (or R252E) mutants showed much higher basal membrane affinity and enzyme activity and faster subcellular translocation than wild type, whereas a double charge-reversal mutant (D55K/R252E) behaved analogously to wild type, indicating that a direct electrostatic interaction between the two residues is essential for the C1A-C2 tethering.

Based upon structural differences in the regulatory domain, PKCs are typically subdivided into three classes; conventional PKC (cPKC: α, βI, βII, and γ subtypes), novel PKC (nPKC: δ, ϵ, η, and θ subtypes), and atypical PKC (ζ and λ/ι subtypes). cPKCs and nPKCs have two types of membrane-targeting domains, a tandem repeat of C1 domains (C1A and C1B) and a C2 domain, in the regulatory domain. protein kinase C 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (3-[3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate conventional protein kinase C sn-1,2-diacylglycerol 1-octanoyl-2-(8-pyrenyloctanoyl)-sn-3-glycerol sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium enhanced green fluorescent protein human embryonic kidney novel protein kinase C 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositol 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine phosphatidylglycerol phosphatidylserine surface plasmon resonance The C1 domain (∼50 residues) is a highly conserved, cysteine-rich compact structure that was initially identified as the interaction site for 1,2-diacyl-sn-3-glycerol (DAG) and phorbol ester in PKCs (4Brose N.

Owing to this unique structural feature, C1 domains can effectively penetrate the membrane containing anionic lipids. Although it was reported that PKCβII C1B domain has stereospecificity for the phosphatidylserine (PS) headgroup (17Johnson J.E. Giorgione J. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11360-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), other PKC C1 domains do not distinguish among anionic phospholipids (8Ananthanarayanan B. Stahelin R.V.

The C2 domain (∼130 residues) is an eight-stranded β sandwich protein that shows higher structural and functional diversity than the C1 domain (6Cho W. Stahelin R.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

The C2 domains of cPKCs bind multiple Ca2+ ions in their Ca2+-binding loops and thereby play a key role in Ca2+-dependent membrane binding of cPKCs (6Cho W. Stahelin R.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2005; 34: 119-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 18Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 19Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J.

In particular, recent structural (21Verdaguer N. Corbalan-Garcia S. Ochoa W.F. Fita I. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6329-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and mutational (22Conesa-Zamora P. Lopez-Andreo M.J. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Corbalan-Garcia S.

All nPKCs contain a Ca2+-independent C2 domain in the amino terminus, but its role in membrane binding and activation of nPKCs is not fully understood. Membrane binding and activation of cPKCs and nPKCs require DAG and PKC phosphorylation (and Ca2+ for cPKCs) and may also depend on binding to other lipids and proteins (1Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 2Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 3Shirai Y. Saito N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Earlier in vitro membrane binding and activity assays indicated that PS is an essential activator of PKCs (24Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4667-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown, however, that PS dependence (or selectivity) in membrane binding and activation varies among PKC isoforms: e.g. PKCα and PKCδ show high PS selectivity, whereas PKCγ and PKCϵ exhibit little PS selectivity (8Ananthanarayanan B.

Thus, it appears that PS selectivity of the intact PKC molecules is a complex phenomenon that does not simply reflect the PS specificity of isolated membrane targeting domains. Extensive biochemical studies have been performed to elucidate the mechanisms by which cPKC and nPKC isoforms bind to the membrane and get activated. Our recent studies on PKCα (28Medkova M. Cho W.

Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19784-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have revealed that individual PKC isoforms follow distinct membrane-binding mechanisms and show different PS selectivity due in part to the differences in the accessibility and DAG affinity of their C1 domains. In the case of PKCα, initial Ca2+- and PS-dependent membrane binding by the C2 domain is followed by the subsequent membrane penetration and DAG binding by the C1A domain, which eventually leads to enzyme activation (26Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17544-17552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the resting state, the C1A domain is not available for DAG binding, because it is tethered to the C2 domain (or other parts of the molecule) via conserved Asp55 in the C1A domain. It has been proposed that PS specifically unleashes this interdomain tethering, because its carboxyl group effectively replaces that of Asp55; hence the PS selectivity (29Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4218-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 6). The C1B domain is not directly involved in membrane binding and activation because of its extremely low DAG affinity (8Ananthanarayanan B. Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46886-46894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast to PKCα, PKCγ has high membrane binding and enzymatic activities without PS, because its C1A and C1B domains are readily accessible and have comparably high DAG affinities (8Ananthanarayanan B. Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46886-46894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Among nPKCs, PKCδ behaves like PKCα, and PKCϵ is similar to PKCγ with respect to PS selectivity and the DAG affinity and accessibility of their C1A and C1B domains (9Stahelin R.V.

The notion of the intramolecular tethering (or masking) of C1 domains has been also supported by reports from other laboratories (31Oancea E. Meyer T.

Acta. 2000; 1487: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported that the C2 domain of PKCα is directly involved in the DAG-dependent binding of the C1 domain to membrane. Stubbs and coworkers (33Slater S.J. Seiz J.L. Cook A.C. Buzas C.J. Malinowski S.A. Kershner J.L. Stagliano B.A. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol.

More recently, it has been reported that a cluster of Lys residues on the concave surface of the C2 domain interact with Asp55 (34Ochoa W.F. Corbalan-Garcia S. Eritja R. Rodriguez-Alfaro J.A.

Despite this mounting evidence, little is known about the nature of C1-C2 interdomain interactions and the residues involved in these interactions. In the present study, we performed computational modeling, in vitro membrane binding and activity measurements, and cellular membrane translocation measurements of PKCα and mutants to identify the residues directly involved in the C1A-C2 interdomain interactions in PKCα. The results not only provide new structural insight into PKCα C1A-C2 interdomain interactions but also lend further support on our proposed mechanism of PKCα activation.

The sequence identity between these two C1 domains is very high (42%). Zinc was docked into the homology model based on structure superposition with the C1B structure. The quality of the model is good based on the results from Verify3D (39Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D.

The protein docking programs Global Range Molecular Matching (GRAMM) (40Vakser I.A. Jiang S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and DOCK4 (41Kuntz I.D.

GRAMM searches for geometric and hydrophobic complementarity between two proteins, whereas DOCK evaluates geometric and, more generally, chemical complementarity, although the user is required to define, as an input to the program, the docking surface on one protein, which is designated the “receptor” (here, the C2 domain). The parameters used for GRAMM are as follows: the matching mode was generic; the grid step was 6.8 Å; the repulsion was 6.5; the attraction double range was 0.0; the potential range type was grid-step; the projection was gray; the number of matches to output was 1000; and the angle of rotations was 20°. For DOCK4, we followed the recommended protocol, which defines how the system and information describing it is represented on the computational grid. Following docking, the results were corroborated by computational analysis of the predicted docked interface. Expression Vector Construction and Mutagenesis—Baculovirus transfer vectors encoding the cDNA of PKCα with appropriate C1 or C2 domain mutations were generated by the overlap extension PCR (42Ho S.N.

The PCR product was purified on an agarose gel, and the PKCα gene was digested with NotI and EcoRI and subcloned into the pVL1392 vector digested with the same restriction enzymes. The mutagenesis was verified by DNA sequencing. Mammalian expression vectors for PKCα and mutants with carboxyl-terminal enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) tags were generated by subcloning the respective genes into the pIND (Invitrogen) with the spacer sequence, GGNSGG, as described previously (8Ananthanarayanan B.

The transfection of Sf9 cells with pVL1392-PKCα constructs was performed using a BaculoGold™ transfection kit from BD Pharmingen. The plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared by using an EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen) to avoid potential endotoxin contamination. Cells were incubated for 4 days at 27 °C, and the supernatant was collected and used to infect more cells for the amplification of virus. After three cycles of amplification, high-titer virus stock solution was obtained. Sf9 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in TMN-FH medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For protein expression, cells were grown to 2 × 106 cells/ml in 350-ml suspension cultures and infected with the multiplicity of infection of 10. The cells were then incubated for 60 h at 27 °C. PKCα wild type and mutants were purified as described previously (30Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17544-17552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Determination of PKC Activity—Activity of PKCα was assayed by measuring the initial rate of [32P]phosphate incorporation [γ-32 from P]ATP (50 μm, 0.6 μCi/tube) into the histone III-SS (400 μg/ml, Sigma). The reaction mixture contained large unilamellar vesicles (0.2 mm of total lipid concentration), 0.16 m KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm MgCl2 in 50 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. For experiments with different [Ca2+], the free calcium concentration was adjusted using the mixture of EGTA and CaCl2 according to the method of Bers (43Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were started by adding 50 mm MgCl2 to the mixture, incubating the mixture for 10 min at room temperature, and quenching by the addition of 50 μl of 5% phosphoric acid. 75 μl of quenched reaction mixtures were spotted on P-81 ion-exchange paper, washed 4 times with a 5% solution of phosphoric acid, followed by 1 wash in 95% ethanol. Papers were transferred into scintillation vials containing 4 ml of scintillation fluid (Fisher Scientific), and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Monolayer Measurements—Surface pressure (π) of solution in a circular Teflon trough (4-cm diameter × 1-cm deep) was measured using a Wilhelmy plate attached to a computer-controlled Cahn electrobalance (Model C-32) as described previously (30Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17544-17552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 5-10 μl of phospholipid solution in ethanol/hexane (1:9 (v/v)) was spread onto 10 ml of subphase (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl and either 0.1 mm EGTA or 0.1 mm CaCl2) to form a monolayer with a given initial surface pressure (π0). Once the surface pressure reading of monolayer had been stabilized (after ∼5 min), the protein solution (typically 40 μl) was injected into the subphase through a small hole drilled at an angle through the wall of the trough, and the change in surface pressure (Δπ) was measured as a function of time. Typically, the Δπ value reached a maximum after 20 min. The maximal Δπ value at a given π0 depended on the protein concentration and reached a saturation value (i.e. [PKCα] ≥ 1.5 μg/ml). Protein concentrations in the subphase were therefore maintained above such values to ensure that the observed Δπ represented a maximal value. The critical surface pressure (πc) was determined by extrapolating the Δπ versus π0 plot to the x-axis (44Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Kinetics of vesicle-PKC binding was determined by the SPR analysis using a BIAcore X biosensor system (Biacore AB) and the L1 chip as described previously (29Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4218-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 45Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The first flow cell was used as a control cell and was coated with 5400 resonance units of POPC. The second flow cell contained the surface coated with vesicles with varying lipid compositions (e.g. POPC/POPS/DiC18 = 79:20:1) at 5400 resonance units. After lipid coating, 30 μ l of 50 mm NaOH was injected at 100 μl/min three times to wash out loosely bound lipids. Typically, no further decrease in SPR signal was observed after one wash cycle. After coating, the drift in signal was allowed to stabilize below 0.3 resonance unit/min before any binding measurements, which were performed at 25 °C and at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. 90 μl of protein sample was injected for an association time of 3 min, and the dissociation was then monitored for 10 min in running buffer. After each measurement, the lipid surface was typically regenerated with a 10-μl pulse of 50 mm NaOH. The regeneration solution was passed over the immobilized vesicle surface until the SPR signal reached the initial background value before protein injection. For data acquisition, five or more different concentrations (typically within a 10-fold range above or below the Kd) of each enzyme were used, and data sets were repeated three or more times. When needed, the entire lipid surface was removed with a 5-min injection of 40 mm CHAPS followed by a 5-min injection of 40 mm octyl glucoside at 5 μl/min, and the sensor chip was recoated for the next set of measurements. All data were analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore) to determine the rate constants of association (ka) and dissociation (kd) as described pre"

https://openalex.org/W1995506854,"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) is a dual inhibitor of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and some adamalysins, two families of extracellular and cell surface metalloproteinases that function in extracellular matrix turnover and the shedding of cell surface proteins. The mechanism of inhibition of MMPs by TIMPs has been well characterized, and since the catalytic domains of MMPs and adamalysins are homologous, it was assumed that the interaction of TIMP-3 with adamalysins is closely similar. Here we report that the inhibition of the extracellular region of ADAM-17 (tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme (TACE)) by the inhibitory domain of TIMP-3 (N-TIMP-3) shows positive cooperativity. Also, mutations in the core of the MMP interaction surface of N-TIMP-3 dramatically reduce the binding affinity for MMPs but have little effect on the inhibitory activity for TACE. These results suggest that the mechanism of inhibition of ADAM-17 by TIMP-3 may be distinct from that for MMPs. The mutant proteins are also effective inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) release from phorbol ester-stimulated cells, indicating that they provide a lead for engineering TACE-specific inhibitors that may reduce side effects arising from MMP inhibition and are possibly useful for treatment of diseases associated with excessive TNF-α levels such as rheumatoid arthritis.

The turnover of proteins in the matrix, catalyzed principally by MMPs, is necessary for morphogenesis, tissue remodeling, blastocyst implantation, wound healing, and many other important physiological processes (1Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 126-127Google Scholar), while ADAMs catalyze the shedding of the ectodomains of cell surface proteins, releasing cytokines, growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, and receptors (2Moss M.L. Bartsch J.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7227-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 3Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar), processes linked to signal transduction, cell growth, and cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Enhanced activities of specific MMPs and ADAMs underlie or contribute to many critical human diseases including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and heart disease (1Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 126-127Google Scholar, 2Moss M.L. Bartsch J.G.

MMP activities in the extracellular matrix are regulated by four endogenous inhibitory proteins, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), TIMP-1 to TIMP-4. These are, with few exceptions, broad-spectrum inhibitors of the more than twenty MMPs found in humans (4Nagase H. Brew K. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2003; 70: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, TIMP-3 efficiently inhibits some adamalysins, including ADAM10 (5Amour A. Knight C.G. Webster A. Slocombe P.M.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12501-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar); TIMP-1 also inhibits ADAM-10 (5Amour A. Knight C.G. Webster A. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). TIMPs have two domains and exhibit multiple biological activities such as the stimulation of the growth of certain cells, induction or protection from apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis (9Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar, 10Baker A.H. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3719-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). The metalloproteinase inhibitory activity resides in the larger (∼120 residue) N-terminal domain whereas the smaller, ∼65-residue, C-terminal domain mediates interactions with the hemopexin domains of some pro-MMPs. Mutations in the human TIMP-3 gene that result in X to Cys substitutions and truncations in the C-terminal domain of human TIMP-3 are the cause of Sorsbys fundus dystrophy, an autosomal dominant disorder that produces early onset macular degeneration (11Weber B.H.F.

Biol. 2003; 533: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The structures of complexes of TIMP-1 with the catalytic domain of MMP-3 (13Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar)), show that a structurally contiguous region around the conserved Cys1 to Cys70 disulfide bond of TIMP (TIMP-1 sequence numbering) inserts into the active site groove of the MMP. Cys1 bidentally coordinates the catalytic Zn2+ through its α-amino and carbonyl groups, while the side chain of residue 2 (Thr or Ser) enters into the mouth of the S1′ specificity pocket of the protease. Most (75%) of the interactions with the MMP involve two sections of polypeptide chain of the TIMP around the Cys1 to Cys70 disulfide bond (residues 1–4 and 66–70, see Fig. 1).

Substitutions for key amino acids in the interaction interface, residues 2, 4, or 68, singly and in combination, differentially affect the affinity of N-TIMP-1 for different MMPs (18Meng Q.

This suggests that the specificity of TIMPs can be modified to produce more targeted MMP inhibitors. TACE (ADAM-17) is a type-1 membrane protein composed of an extracellular multidomain region, a transmembrane segment, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Within the extracellular region of the active enzyme are a metalloendopepeptidase catalytic domain, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich domain, and a crambin-like domain (2Moss M.L. Bartsch J.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7227-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 3Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Many previous studies of the structural, catalytic, and inhibitory properties of TACE have focused on the truncated catalytic domain (20Maskos K. Fernandez-Catalan C. Huber R. Bourenkov G.P.

Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Blanton R.A. Shows D. Peschon J.J. Black R.A. J. Biol.

Some ADAMs lack protease activity, but those that are catalytically active share with the MMPs a canonical zinc-binding HEXX-HXXGXXH sequence motif and a Met turn in their catalytic domains (www.people.virginia.edu/~jw7g/). However the ADAMs and MMPs are very divergent in overall sequence and their catalytic domains differ considerably in three-dimensional structure (20Maskos K. Fernandez-Catalan C. Huber R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Ellestad G.A. Reddy P. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Castner B.J. Davis R. Clarke H.R. Petersen M. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. March C.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3408-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), raising the question of whether TIMP-3 binds to and inhibits both protease groups through a similar mechanism. To address this question, we have constructed mutants of N-TIMP-3 that disrupt the interaction interface for MMPs. The properties of these mutants as inhibitors of TACE suggest that the interaction of TIMP-3 with TACE and the mechanism of inhibition are distinct from those for MMPs. Materials—The plasmid pET-42b-N-timp-3His8 containing the gene encoding a C-terminally His-tagged form of the N-terminal domain of TIMP-3 in the pET-42b vector (Novagen) was generated as described previously (8Kashiwagi M. Tortorella M. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12501-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). All reagents, cells, and instruments used for plasmid construction and for the expression, purification, and in vitro folding of N-TIMP-3 mutants were from the same sources as in previous studies (8Kashiwagi M. Tortorella M. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12501-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Metalloproteinases and substrates used in the kinetic assays were obtained from previously reported sources (19Wei S. Chen Y. Chung L. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9831-9834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Wei S. Xie Z. Filenova E. Brew K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12200-12207Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). N-TIMP-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and folded in vitro as described (19Wei S. Chen Y. Chung L. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9831-9834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI-2 (HONHCOCH2CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CO-t-butyl-Gly-Ala-NHCH2CH2NH2) was from Peptides International. Human monocyte THP-1 cells and RPMI 1640 medium were purchased from ATCC, while phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was from Sigma and the antibodies used for ELISA were from Pharmingen. Construction of N-TIMP-3 Mutants—The plasmid pET-42b-N-timp-3His8 was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis by PCR. The forward primers used (the mutated codons are underlined and the restriction sites are shown in italic) were 5′-AAAACATATGTGCGGATGCTCGCCCAGCCAC-3′ (for T2G) and 5′-AAAACATATGGCATGCACATGCTCGCCCAGCCAC-3′ (for-1Ala). The reverse primer was 5′-AAAAGCGGCCGCGTTACAACCCAGGTGATA-3′. Reactions were carried out for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min after a hot start at 94 °C for 3 min in a PCR Sprint HYBAID system using the Vent PCR kit (New England Biolabs). PCR products were cloned back into the pET-42b vector using the NdeI and NotI sites (both enzymes were from New England Biolabs) and confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing using T7 promoter primer. Expression, Purification, and in Vitro Folding of N-TIMP-3 and Mutants—N-TIMP-3 and its mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells as inclusion bodies. The proteins were extracted with 6 m guanidine HCl and purified by Ni2+-chelate chromatography in 6 m guanidine as described previously (8Kashiwagi M. Tortorella M. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12501-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were treated with cystamine and were folded in vitro by removing the denaturant by dialysis in the presence of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide essentially as described (8Kashiwagi M. Tortorella M. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12501-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) except that 1 m NaCl was included to enhance protein solubility during the folding process. The folded proteins were subsequently loaded to a 5-ml Ni2+-NTA column previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 m NaCl and 20% glycerol and eluted with the same buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. Enzyme Inhibition Kinetic Studies—Inhibition kinetic studies for MMPs and TACE were carried out as described previously (19Wei S. Chen Y. Chung L. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9831-9834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Wei S. Xie Z. Filenova E. Brew K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12200-12207Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with modifications. Purified N-TIMP-3 and mutants were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl containing 20% glycerol and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to remove any precipitate, and protein concentration was re-measured before conducting inhibition assays. Since NaCl inhibits the activity of the TACE ectodomain in vitro (28Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B. Su J.L. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30563-30570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we adjusted the final concentration of NaCl to 5 mm in all assays with TACE. The same dialysis buffer was used to make serial dilutions of N-TIMP-3 and mutants, and equal volumes (10% of total assay volume) were added to TACE assays, resulting in a final pH of 8.8 and NaCl concentration of 5 mm. Inhibition data were analyzed by fitting to the following equations as appropriate: tight binding inhibition (Equation 1), v/v0=E-I-K+((E-I-K)2+4EK)0.52E(Eq. 1) normal inhibition (Equation 2), v=v0/(1+I/K)(Eq. 2) and cooperative Inhibition (Equation 3) (29Cortez A. Cascante M. Cardenas M.L. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 263-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), v=v0/(1+(I/K)h)(Eq. 3) where v is the experimentally determined reaction velocity, v0 is the uninhibited activity, E is enzyme concentration, I is inhibitor concentration, K is the apparent inhibition constant (Ki(app)), and h is the Hill coefficient. Inhibition of TNF-α Shedding from THP-1 Cells—All TIMP solutions were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 20% glycerol before use. Human monocyte THP-1 cells cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum were harvested, extensively washed, and reseeded into serum-free medium at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. Shedding was stimulated by adding PMA to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml, and cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 20 min before adding 0.10 volume of various concentrations of N-TIMP-3 or a mutant. The cells were then further cultured for another 6 h, and the conditioned media were collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm. The amount of soluble TNF-α released into the medium was measured using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described by Engelberts et al. (30Engelberts I. Moller A. Schoen G.J. van der Linden C.J. Buurman W.A. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1991; 10: 69-76PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. The released TNF-α was absorbed to microtiter plates coated with mouse monoclonal anti-human TNF-α antibody BD551220 (1:200 dilution), and the bound TNF-α was detected using biotinylated mouse monoclonal anti-human TNF-α antibody BD554511 (1:500 dilution) and streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as peroxidase substrate (KPL, Guildford, UK). The plates were read at 450 nm with an ELX808 plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.). The standard curve of recombinant human TNF-α covered the range of 60–5,000 pg/ml.

These mutants, as well as wild-type inhibitor, were expressed in bacteria as inclusion bodies, purified, and folded in vitro. A high salt concentration was found to increase the solubility of N-TIMP-3; therefore we included 1 m NaCl throughout the in vitro folding procedure. This significantly increased the yield of N-TIMP-3 and mutants (data not shown). Inhibitory Properties of Mutants with Purified Metalloproteinases—The inhibitory activities of wild-type N-TIMP-3 and the two mutants were determined with MMPs representing four different subgroups: full-length collagenase 1 (MMP-1), gelatinase A (MMP-2), and the catalytic domains of stromelysin 1 (MMP-3(ΔC)) and membrane-type 1 MMP (MMP-14). As previously reported for the corresponding mutants of N-TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 (17Wingfield P.T. Sax J.K. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Chung V. Corcoran M.L. Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J.

Both wild-type N-TIMP-3 and the hydroxamate-based inhibitor, TAPI-2, effectively inhibited the activity of TACE; in contrast, wild-type N-TIMP-1 had minimal inhibitory activity under the same condition (Fig. 2B). The inhibition curve of TACE by wild-type N-TIMP-3 is sigmoid, in striking contrast with the inhibition by TAPI-2 and with the inhibition of MMPs by N-TIMP-3 and N-TIMP-1 (Fig. 2, A and B (31Lee M.H. Rapti M. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40224-40230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)). Sigmoid inhibition curves were also obtained for TACE with the T2G and -1A mutants of N-TIMP-3 (Fig. 2C). These mutations, which severely reduced activity against MMPs, had little effect on the inhibition of TACE. The inhibition data obtained with N-TIMP-3 and its mutants did not fit well with Equations 1 or 2 for tight binding or weak to moderate inhibitors or to other equations describing multisite binding (data not shown) but fit well to Equation 3 for positively cooperative binding. The results indicate that the mutations have only a minor effect on the apparent inhibition constant (Ki(app)) but also reduce the Hill coefficient, h (TABLE TWO).TABLE TWOComparison of inhibition parameters for TACE of N-TIMP-3 and its mutants with TAPI-2Ki(app) and h values were calculated by fitting the data from Fig. 2 with Equation 3.Ki (app)hnmWild-type13.7 ± 0.23.59 ± 0.16T2G35.6 ± 1.92.54 ± 0.25-1A33.9 ± 2.81.9 ± 0.22TAPI-24.28 ± 0.0011 Open table in a new tab The conditions used for TACE and MMP activity measurements differ in pH and ionic strength. To determine whether this could influence our results, we first investigated the inhibitory activities of wild-type N-TIMP-3 and the T2G mutant against TACE at pH 7.5, since MMP inhibition measurements were conducted at this pH. Sigmoid inhibition curves were obtained for both proteins and Ki values were calculated to be 26 ± 3 and 46 ± 2 nm, respectively (data not shown). Second, although it was not possible to conduct TACE activity measurements at higher NaCl concentrations because of the strong inhibitory effects of ionic strength on activity, we also quantified the inhibition of MMP-1 by N-TIMP-3 and the -1A mutant under the conditions used for TACE activity measurements. Both proteins showed normal hyperbolic inhibition profiles with Ki values of 1.6 and 412 nm, respectively (data not shown). Thus, these results show that binding of the wild-type inhibitor was not significantly affected at the higher pH and low ionic strength and the mutation strongly disrupts inhibitory activity against MMP-1 under these conditions. Effects of Mutations in N-TIMP-3 on Inhibition of Cellular Shedding of TNF-α—The ectodomains of many cell surface proteins are released in soluble forms through processing catalyzed by cell surface “sheddases.” Both TACE/ADAM17 and ADAM10 have been found to be active as sheddases, TACE being particularly important for the release of the cytokine TNF-α from its cell surface precursor (32Black R.A.

The release of TNF-α from monocytes is a key for inflammation and immunity, making TACE an interesting target for anti-proteolytic therapies. We investigated the abilities of N-TIMP-3 and mutants to inhibit TNF-α shedding from human monocyte THP-1 cells, where TACE, but not other sheddases, was shown to be the major enzyme responsible for releasing TNF-α from cell surface (33Condon T.P.

https://openalex.org/W2048720088,"Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is the major cytosolic receptor for nitric oxide (NO) that converts GTP into the second messenger cGMP in a NO-dependent manner. Other factors controlling this key enzyme are intracellular proteins such as Hsp90 and PSD95, which bind to sGC and modulate its activity, stability, and localization. To date little is known about the effects of posttranslational modifications of sGC, although circumstantial evidence suggests that reversible phosphorylation may contribute to sGC regulation. Here we demonstrate that inhibitors of protein-tyrosine phosphatases such as pervanadate and bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline)oxovanadate(V) as well as reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 induce specific tyrosine phosphorylation of the β1 but not of the α1 subunit of sGC. Tyrosine phosphorylation of sGCβ1 is also inducible by pervanadate and H2O2 in intact PC12 cells, rat aortic smooth muscle cells, and in rat aortic tissues, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of sGC may also occur in vivo. We have mapped the major tyrosine phosphorylation site to position 192 of β1, where it forms part of a highly acidic phospho-acceptor site for Src-like kinases. In the phosphorylated state Tyr(P)-192 exposes a docking site for SH2 domains and efficiently recruits Src and Fyn to sGCβ1, thereby promoting multiple phosphorylation of the enzyme.

Mammalian sGCs are obligate heterodimers of α and β subunits, each comprising an N-terminal regulatory domain, a central region involved in dimerization, and a C-terminal catalytic domain (1Harteneck C.

Displacement of Fe2+ from the protoporphyrin plane of the nitrosylated heme complex releases the constraint imposed by the His-105 coordination (7Martin E. Sharina I. Kots A. Murad F. Proc. Natl.

Wood J. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Activation of sGC results in the rapid increase of intracellular cGMP levels, and through the stimulation of its multiple downstream effectors cGMP mediates pleiotropic effects such as smooth muscle relaxation, inhibition of platelet aggregation and leukocyte adhesion, and modulation of cell proliferation and migration (9Lucas K.A.

For instance, regulated gene expression of the sGC subunits has been documented (12Mülsch A. Oelze M. Klöss S. Mollnau H. Töpfer A. Smolenski A. Walter U. Stasch J.P. Warnholtz A. Hink U.

Reversible protein-protein interactions of sGC with adaptor proteins such as PSD95 and chaperones like Hsp90, Hsp70, or the η-subunit of the chaperonin-containing t-complex can alter the activity, stability, and localization of sGC (15Russwurm M.

For example, in vitro phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues of the α1 subunit of sGC by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase increased the activity of sGC (19Zwiller J. Revel M.O. Basset P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 1381-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), most likely through stabilization of the nitrosylheme complex (20Kostic T.S. Andric S.A. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 458-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells Ser/Thr phosphorylation by Ca2+-dependent protein kinase enhanced sGC activity (21Zwiller J. Revel M.O.

Acta. 1993; 1177: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas cGMP-dependent protein kinase attenuated the catalytic capacity of sGC, most likely through an inhibitory feedback mechanism (23Murthy K.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 199-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) via stimulation of protein phosphatase(s) which reduces the Ser/Thr phosphorylation level of β1 (24Ferrero R. Rodriguez-Pascual F. Miras-Portugal M.T. Torres M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2029-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Circumstantial evidence suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation may also contribute to sGC activity regulation in PC12 cells through 17β-estradiol-mediated activation of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) such as SHP-1 (25Chen Z.J. Che D. Vetter M. Liu S. Chang C.H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 78: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); however, Tyr phosphorylation of sGC has not been demonstrated to date.Multiple signaling pathways are governed by the delicately balanced activities of protein-tyrosine kinases and PTPs, which govern cellular signaling through reversible Tyr phosphorylation (26Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar). In the case of receptor-tyrosine kinases binding of the cognate ligands promotes the recruitment and phosphorylation of cytosolic substrates, often endowed with Src homology type 2 (SH2) and/or phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) binding domains. Alternatively ligand-independent stimulation of receptor-tyrosine kinases, e.g. by reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or by UV light, may also trigger Tyr phosphorylation pathways (27Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 28Herrlich P. Böhmer F.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Among the major downstream targets of H2O2-driven receptor-tyrosine kinase pathways are members of the Src kinase family, which can also be activated by H2O2 (29Zhuang S. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J.

Activated Src-like kinases can phosphorylate multiple signal relay molecules and alter their structure or function by changing the catalytic activity, localization, and/or composition of signaling complexes through the recruitment of accessory proteins (32Pawson T.

We demonstrate Tyr phosphorylation of sGC in native and transfected cells as well as in intact aortic tissue. We show that both inhibition of PTPs and reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 induce Tyr phosphorylation of sGC, thereby promoting the recruitment of Src-like kinases to the Tyr-phosphorylated β1 subunit. Our findings point to an unexpected cross-talk between NO/cGMP and tyrosine kinase signaling pathways at the level of sGC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—DMEM, FCS, and penicillin/streptomycin were obtained from PAA (Pasching, Austria); gentamicin was from Invitrogen; elastase and collagenase were from Worthington (Lakewood, NJ); ECLTM detection reagents and glutathione-SepharoseTM 4B were from Amersham Biosciences; monoclonal antibody to c-Src (clone H-12) and protein A/G PLUS-agarose was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr-100, anti-pY) was from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); kinase inhibitor PP1 was from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany); kinase inhibitor PP2 and phosphatase inhibitor bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline)oxovanadate(V) (bpV(phen)) were from Calbiochem; complete protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Applied Science.

Antisera to the regulatory domain of human sGCα1 (1–419) and to the catalytic domain of β1 (404–619) were produced in rabbits (AS558 and AS556, respectively) or mice (AS613, AS614) with the corresponding GST fusion proteins as described (4Zhou Z.

The cDNA fragment of β1 was ligated into the EcoRI site of pEDmtxr. For the expression of vesicular stomatitis virus-tagged β1 or single domains thereof, we amplified the corresponding cDNA segments by PCR and subcloned them into pSG8 previously modified for in-frame expression of an N-terminal vesicular stomatitis virus tag. Single point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The cDNAs for wild type (WT) and dominant-negative mutant of chicken Src, pSG5-Src and pSG5-SrcK–, respectively, were generous gifts of Dr. Rudi Busse (University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany). All constructs were subjected to DNA sequencing before use.Transfection and Cell Culture—COS-1 and PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Transient transfections of COS-1 cells were done with DEAE-dextran. In brief, a 10-cm dish containing 6 × 105 cells was washed with PBS, and expression plasmids were applied in 5.7-ml serum-free medium mixed with 300 μl of DEAE-dextran (1 mg/ml) and 12 μl chloroquine (100 mm). After incubation for 2.5 h, cells were treated with 10% Me2SO in PBS for 2 min and cultured in DMEM, 10% FCS for 24–48 h before use. To induce Tyr phosphorylation, cells were incubated for 20–30 min at 37 °C with 20 μm bpV-(phen) or 30 min with 100 μm pervanadate (PV) in DMEM, 10% FCS unless stated otherwise. The PV solution was freshly prepared by incubating 10 mm Na3VO4 and 300 mm H2O2 for 10 min at RT. To inhibit Src family tyrosine kinases, cells were incubated with PP1 or PP2 (final concentration 2.5–10 μm, as indicated) for 1 h followed by incubation with 20 μm bpV(phen) for 30 min. To induce oxidative stress, H2O2 was added to the medium at the indicated concentrations for 2–20 min. Alternatively, cells were incubated with 2.5 milliunits/ml xanthine oxidase in the absence (control) or presence of 100 μm xanthine. Before stimulation with 10 ng/ml EGF or 50 ng/ml NGF, cells were starved overnight in DMEM, 0.5% FCS. SYF, i.e. cells deficient in Src, Yes, and Fyn, and Src++, i.e. cells deficient in Yes and Fyn but retaining normal Src levels (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. For transient transfections, 5-cm dishes containing 8 × 105 Src, Yes, and Fyn or 4 × 105 Src2+, cells were treated with Nanofectin (PAA) and expression plasmids coding for sGCα1 and sGCβ1 and incubated for 24 h before use. Tyr phosphorylation was induced as detailed above.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation was done as described (33Meurer S. Pioch S. Wagner K. Müller-Esterl W. Gross S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49346-49354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 25 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture), and the cleared lysate was incubated with antiserum. After immunoprecipitation samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting (33Meurer S. Pioch S. Wagner K. Müller-Esterl W. Gross S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49346-49354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).GST Fusion Proteins and GST Pull-down Assay—Bacterial expression plasmids encoding the SH3 domain alone or GST fusions of the SH2/SH3 domains combined were a kind gift of Dr. Ivan Dikic (University of Frankfurt, Germany). The cDNAs encoding the unique SH2 domains of tyrosine kinases Src, Fyn, and Abl or the second SH2 domain of phospholipase Cγ1 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX2T. The single point mutation (R175G) was introduced into the Src SH2 domain using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 for 4 h at 30 °C after induction with 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were pelleted, washed with PBS, resuspended in PBS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysed by sonification. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, glutathione-Sepharose beads were added to the cleared lysate, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4° Cona rotating wheel. Beads were washed 4× with PBS, and Sepharose-bound GST fusion proteins were incubated for 3 h at 4°C with Triton X-100-soluble extracts from COS-1 cells overexpressing WT β1, mutant β1[Y192F], or WT α1β1 pretreated with or without 100 μm PV for 30 min. Beads were washed 4× with immunoprecipitation buffer, and bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by Western blotting (33Meurer S. Pioch S. Wagner K. Müller-Esterl W. Gross S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49346-49354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).In Vitro Phosphorylation—For in vitro phosphorylation, the cDNA comprising position 133–250 of β1 was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX2T vector. Glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled to 10 μgof purified GST-GCβ1-(133–250) (see above) were washed with labeling buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 μm EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml BSA) and resuspended in 45 μl of kinase buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 60 μm EDTA, 0.03% (v/v) Triton X-100, 60 μg/ml BSA, 100 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2). The reaction was started by adding 1.5 units of recombinant Src (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) to the suspension. After incubation for 2.5 h at 37 °C, the beads were washed 3× with labeling buffer. Protein was eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-PY.Tissue Preparation and Isolation of Rat Aortic Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells—Anesthetized 6-week-old Wistar rats were sacrificed, and aortae were excised, cleaned from connective tissue, and placed in PBS. Aortae were cut in rings of ∼3-mm height and placed in DMEM, 10% FCS with or without 100 μm PV for 1 h. Medium was aspirated, tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and minced mechanically, and immunoprecipitation of sGC subunits was done as detailed above. Alternatively, aortae were cut into small pieces and placed in 500 μl of digestion medium (DMEM including 20 mm HEPES, 2 mg/ml collagenase, 0.18 mg/ml elastase, 1 mg/ml BSA, 50 μg/ml gentamicin) for 30 min. After centrifugation at 800 × g for 3 min, the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of digestion medium and further incubated for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 ml of DMEM, 10% FCS. Cells were centrifuged as above, resuspended in 2 ml of DMEM, 10% FCS, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and seeded on a 3-cm dish. Three days after isolation medium was changed to DMEM, 10% FCS containing penicillin/streptomycin.sGC Activity Assay—COS-1 cells were transfected with α1 and β1 or β1[Y192F], and 24 h later the cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with or without 20 μm bpV(phen) in HEPES-buffered DMEM, 10% FCS. To monitor sGC activity we added phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine IBMX (final concentration 1 mm) 10 min before stimulation. Cells were stimulated with DETA/NO, diluted in assay buffer (15 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1.2 mm Na2HPO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 3 mm KCl, 130 mm NaCl, 11 mm glucose, 1 mm IBMX) in the presence or absence of 20 μm bpV(phen) for 3 min and lysed with 0.1 m HCl. The acid extracts were collected, and intracellular cGMP was quantified using the cyclic GMP (low pH) immunoassay (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany).Data Analyses and Statistics—Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was tested by Student's t test and set at p < 0.01 (***). Potential phosphorylation sites were identified by the NetPhos 2.0 program (Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Technical University of Denmark).RESULTSPervanadate Treatment Reveals Tyr Phosphorylation of the β1 Subunit of Human sGC—To screen for Tyr phosphorylation of sGC, we overexpressed the α1 and β1 subunits of human sGC in COS-1 cells, singly or combined. The cells were incubated in the absence or presence of the broad-specificity PTP inhibitor PV at 100 μm for 5–40 min or at the indicated concentrations for 30 min. After cell lysis immunoprecipitation was done with subunit-specific antibodies followed by Western blotting with anti-pY. A dose- and time-dependent Tyr phosphorylation peaking around 30 min was observed for the β1 but not for the α1 subunit of sGC (Fig. 1, A and B; supplemental Fig. S1). Under the same conditions we observed phosphorylation of the singly expressed β1 subunit but not of α1 (Fig. 1A, right panel) and demonstrated that phosphorylation of β1 also occurs in the holoenzyme, i.e. when β1 is associated with α1 (Fig. 1B). To map the phosphorylated region(s) in β1 we used vesicular stomatitis virus-tagged constructs harboring the regulatory or catalytic domains of β1, i.e. β1-(1–348) and β1-(349–619), respectively. Incubation of transfected cells with PV specifically revealed Tyr phosphorylation of the regulatory but not the catalytic domain of β1 (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, inhibition of PTPs by PV reveals Tyr phosphorylation of the regulatory domain of sGCβ1.PTP Inhibition Modulates NO-induced sGC Activity—We wondered whether Tyr phosphorylation of β1 might have an impact on sGC activity. To exclude a direct effect on sGC activity by H2O2 (which is required for the in situ production of PV), we employed the PTP inhibitor bpV-(phen), which also induced sGCβ1 phosphorylation without affecting the level of total sGC protein (Fig. 2B, upper panels). We stimulated COS-1 cells expressing human α1β1 with increasing concentrations of the NO donor DETA/NO in the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (1 mm) and monitored the generation of cGMP (Fig. 2A). Incubation of 105 cells with 0.3 and 100 μm DETA/NO for 3 min resulted in the production of 4.5 ± 0.3 and 60 ± 1.8 pmol of cGMP, respectively. The concentration-response curves recorded with or without bpV(phen) revealed two prominent differences; the presence of PTP inhibitor increased basal sGC activity by a factor of 2.3 ± 0.1 (Fig. 2A, right inset) and shifted the concentration-response curve for DETA/NO to the right such that the corresponding EC50 value more than doubled (12.3 ± 1.4 μm versus 5.9 ± 0.7 μm under control conditions). Thus, both cyclase activity and NO responsiveness of sGC are moderately affected by the presence of PTP inhibitors.FIGURE 2NO-induced sGC activity is inhibited by Tyr phosphorylation in COS-1 cells. A, COS-1 cells expressing WT α1β1 or mutant α1β1[Y192F] (left inset) stimulated with increasing concentrations of DETA/NO for 3 min in the presence of 1 mm IBMX, with (•) or without (▪) before incubation with 20 μm bpV(phen) for 20 min. Media were aspirated, and 0.1 m HCl was added to extract cGMP. The extracts were collected, and cGMP concentrations were quantified (given as percent of cGMP level at 500 μm DETA/NO). Changes of the basal activity of sGC in the presence of 20 μm bpV(phen) are given as ×-fold over control in the absence of the inhibitor (right inset). B, COS-1 cells expressing α1β1 (top panel) or α1β1[Y192F] (bottom panel) were incubated with (+) or without (–) 20 μm bpV(phen). Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-β1 (AS566) followed by Western blotting (WB) with anti-pY, anti-β1 (AS614), or antibodies to α1β1 (mixture of AS566 and AS587). Data are the means ± S.E. from three consecutive measurements; representatives of three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Major Phosphorylation Site of sGCβ1 Is at Tyr-192—To test whether Tyr phosphorylation is causally linked to activity modulation of sGC, we mapped the phosphorylation site(s) present in the regulatory domain of β1. Of 13 Tyr residues, Tyr-83 and Tyr-192 were predicted by the NetPhos algorithm to be primary target sites for tyrosine kinases. Mutants of β1, where Phe substituted for Tyr, were overexpressed in COS-1 cells in the absence or presence of PV. Under these conditions phosphorylation of β1[Y83F] was similar to that of WT β1, whereas phosphorylation of β1[Y192F] was markedly reduced (Fig. 1C). Thus, it appears that PV can induce phosphorylation of Tyr residues in the regulatory subunit of sGCβ1 and that the major although not exclusive phosphorylation site is at residue Tyr-192. To substantiate this finding, we generated an antibody specific for Tyr(P)-192 and found that it specifically detects β1 phosphorylation in the presence but not in the absence of PV both in immunoprecipitates of the singly expressed β1 subunit (Fig. 1D) and in total cell lysates of the α1β1 holoenzyme (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. S3). To test whether Tyr phosphorylation of Tyr-192 is responsible for sGC activity modulation we co-expressed WT α1 and mutant β1[Y192F] in COS-1 cells. Stimulation of mutant α1β1[Y192F] with 0.3 μm and 100 μm DETA/NO resulted in the production of 4.7 ± 0.1 and 58 ± 1.2 pmol/105 cells of cGMP, respectively. Treatment with bpV(phen) induced only minor Tyr phosphorylation of the mutant enzyme (Fig. 2B, bottom panels), yet the concentration-response curves for α1β1[Y192F] in the absence or presence of bpV-(phen) did not significantly differ from those for WT α1β1 (Fig. 2A, left inset). Thus, it appears that PTP inhibition affects sGC activity independently of Tyr-192 phosphorylation.Tyr-192 Phosphorylation Creates a SH2 Docking Site in β1—We wondered about alternative consequence(s) of Tyr-192 phosphorylation. Detailed inspection of the β1 sequence revealed that Tyr-192 residue is embedded in a cluster of negatively charged amino acid residues, 188EEDFYEDLD, and that the phosphorylated motif of pYEDL (pY is phosphorylated tyrosine) could serve as a potential docking site for SH2 domains of Src-like kinases (34Brunati A.M. Donella-Deana A. Ruzzene M. Marin O. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we used lysates of COS-1 cells co-expressing sGC and Src and found that α1β1 co-immunoprecipitates with Src (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S4). To substantiate this finding we employed GST fusion proteins of SH2 and/or SH3 domains of Src to pull down WT β1 or mutant β1[Y192F] from COS-1 cell lysates in the absence or presence of PV. Under these conditions the constructs encompassing SH2/SH3 combined or SH3 alone failed to bind to non-phosphorylated WT β1 or mutant β1[Y192F], whereas in the presence of PV the SH2/SH3 but not the SH3 fusion protein pulled down WT β1 but not β1[Y192F] (Fig. 3B). We were able to reproduce this interaction with the isolated SH2 domain of Src and the sGC holoenzyme. Mutant SH2[R175G], where a crucial arginine residue responsible for binding the phosphate group was mutated to glycine, showed only weak affinity for phospho-β1"
https://openalex.org/W2016410352,"Coilin is a marker protein for the Cajal body, a subnuclear domain acting as a site for assembly and maturation of nuclear RNA-protein complexes. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify coilin-interacting proteins, we have identified hCINAP (human coilin interacting nuclear ATPase protein), a nuclear factor of 172 amino acids with a P-loop nucleotide binding motif and ATPase activity. The hCINAP protein sequence is highly conserved across its full-length from human to plants and yeast and is ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues and cell lines tested. The yeast orthologue of CINAP is a single copy, essential gene. Tagged hCINAP is present in complexes containing coilin in mammalian cells and recombinant, Escherichia coli expressed hCINAP binds directly to coilin in vitro. The 214 carboxyl-terminal residues of coilin appear essential for the interaction with hCINAP. Both immunofluorescence and fluorescent protein tagging show that hCINAP is specifically nuclear and distributed in a widespread, diffuse nucleoplasmic pattern, excluding nucleoli, with some concentration also in Cajal bodies. Overexpression of hCINAP in HeLa cells results in a decrease in the average number of Cajal bodies per nucleus, consistent with it affecting either the stability of Cajal bodies and/or their rate of assembly. The hCINAP mRNA is an alternatively spliced transcript from the TAF9 locus, which encodes the basal transcription factor subunit TAFIID32. However, hCINAP and TAFIID32 mRNAs are translated from different ATG codons and use distinct reading frames, resulting in them having no identity in their respective protein sequences.

They are thought to be centers for the maturation of these nuclear RNA-protein complexes that are en route to their sites of function in the nucleoplasm and nucleolus, respectively (for review see Ref. 1Ogg S.C. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although Cajal bodies do not contain DNA, they have been shown to associate specifically with certain gene loci, including the histone and U snRNA gene clusters (2Frey M.R. Bailey A.D. Weiner A.M.

Cell. 2001; 12: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the case of the U2 genes, studies on stable cell lines containing arrays of exogenous U2 genes showed that Cajal body association was dependent on the expression of the U2 snRNA transcripts, rather than on the presence of specific DNA sequences in the U2 genes (2Frey M.R. Bailey A.D. Weiner A.M. Matera A.G. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 126-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is possible that Cajal bodies can regulate gene expression from certain loci and/or deliver RNA processing factors or other components required for efficient expression at these sites. small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein human coilin-interacting nuclear ATPase protein monoclonal antibody reverse transcription open reading frame yellow fluorescent protein isopropylgalactopyranoside phosphate-buffered saline glutathione S-transferase 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid Coilin is a human autoantigen that is widely used as a marker protein for Cajal bodies. It is a specifically nuclear protein that is modified by both serine phosphorylation and symmetrical dimethylation of arginine. Coilin shows a diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution but also concentrates within Cajal bodies, appearing as one or more bright nuclear foci when analyzed by immunofluorescence. Analysis of a mouse knock-out of coilin has revealed that coilin -/- cells are viable in culture, although animals lacking coilin show a decrease in embryonic viability, as judged by the reduced ratios of coilin -/- mice recovered in litters (5Tucker K.E. Berciano M.T. Jacobs E.Y. LePage D.F. Shpargel K.B. Rossire J.J. Chan E.K. Lafarga M. Conlon R.A. Matera A.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The coilin -/- cells lack normal Cajal bodies but instead have microbodies containing a subset of the usual Cajal body components. Deletion mutants of coilin can disrupt endogenous Cajal bodies when transiently expressed in mammalian cells (6Bohmann K. Ferreira J.A. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 817-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 7Hebert M.D. Szymczyk P.W. Shpargel K.B. Matera A.G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2720-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Coilin is a self-interacting protein, dependent upon sequences in the first 92 amino-terminal residues (8Hebert M.D. Matera A.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4159-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These data indicate that coilin is likely to play a functional role in the formation of wild type Cajal bodies. Several proteins have been shown to bind directly to coilin, including the survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein (7Hebert M.D. Szymczyk P.W. Shpargel K.B. Matera A.G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2720-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the nucleolar shuttling factor NOPP140 (9Isaac C. Yang Y. Meier U.T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the α importins (10Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Science. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), which are adaptors involved in nuclear import. In the case of the SMN protein, its binding to coilin is dependent on the presence in coilin of symmetrical dimethyl arginine residues, a modification shared with the Sm family of snRNP proteins, which also localize in Cajal bodies (11Hebert M.D. Shpargel K.B. Ospina J.K. Tucker K.E. Matera A.G. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 329-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the case of NOPP140, it has been shown that deletion mutants removing the amino-terminal portion of NOPP140, which no longer bind to coilin, have a dominant negative effect on Cajal body formation when exogenously expressed in mammalian cells (9Isaac C. Yang Y. Meier U.T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These data support the important role of coilin in Cajal body formation and further indicate that the mechanisms involved likely require the interaction of coilin with other partner proteins. To search for novel interaction partners for coilin we have conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen using coilin as the bait. Here we report the molecular characterization of hCINAP, a highly conserved nuclear protein that we show binds directly to coilin. Cell Line—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (BD Biosciences), 2 mm glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to full-length, His6-tagged hCINAP were generated at the EMBL animal facility, and by Diagnostics Scotland (Edinburgh, UK). A second rabbit polyclonal antibody, to synthetic peptide DQILKWIEQWIKDHNS, corresponding to amino acid residues 157-175 in hCINAP, was also generated at the EMBL facility. For both antibodies, the specificity of the antiserum from the third bleed was characterized by Western blotting (Fig. 4, and data not shown) and these batches were used for the experiments described here (1:400 dilution for Western blotting and immunofluorescence with the anti-recombinant protein antibody, 1:400 for blotting and 1:200 for immunofluorescence with the anti-peptide antibody). The following primary antibodies were used: rabit anti-coilin 204/5 (6Bohmann K. Ferreira J.A. Lamond A.I. J.

Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). The following secondary antibodies were used (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany): fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated, donkey anti-mouse IgG, Texas Red-conjugated, goat anti-mouse IgG+M, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated, donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and rhodamine-conjugated, donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Oligonucleotides—The following oligonucleotides were used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications: oligonucleotide 1, 5′-cggaattcatgttgcttccgaacatcctg-3′; oligonucleotide 2, 5′-ccagactccatgatatccgatgatc-3′; oligonucleotide 3, 5′-accgtcgacttaagtagctagccttataag-3′; oligonucleotide 4, 5′-acattcagcaaggctagattacag-3′; oligonucleotide 5, 5′-acaccaaagtgtcccttac-3′; oligonucleotide 6, 5′-taatgtgggtgatttagctcgagaag-3′; oligonucleotide 7, 5′-cttcattgacctcaactacatggt-3′; and oligonucleotide 8, 5′-tcatggatgaccttggccaggg-3′. Two-hybrid System Analysis—Vectors and yeast strains for the two-hybrid analysis were used as described by Brent and coworkers (15Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar), and β-galactosidase assays were performed as reported (16Kandels-Lewis S. Seraphin B. Science. 1993; 262: 2035-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 17Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). A HeLa cDNA library was used to generate the activation domain fusion constructs. Interacting clones were identified as described (10Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Science. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). For mapping the CINAP interaction domain on coilin, deletion constructs of coilin (as shown in Fig. 7) were subcloned either as restriction- or PCR-amplified fragments in yeast vector pGBKT7 or vector pACT2 for construct C1. They were each tested for interaction by co-transformation in yeast strain AH109 with full-length hCINAP in yeast vector pACT2 (or in pGBKT7 for testing with C1), followed by screening of reporter gene expression on appropriate selective media. First, transformants were selected with double selection on media lacking leucine and tryptophan and then transferred to quadruple selection on media also lacking adenine and histidine. Clones that were viable on quadruple selection were subjected to colony β-galactosidase assay for confirmation of the interaction. For independent confirmation of the interaction, coilin constructs were in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated either with lysate from bacteria expressing glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged full-length CINAP after induction with 1 mm IPTG or without induction as negative control. Proteins interacting with GST-CINAP were recovered by glutathione-agarose pull-down and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography to detect coilin fragments. RT-PCR, Semiquantitative RT-PCR for the TAF9 Locus Transcripts, and PCR on Genomic DNA—cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of purified human placenta poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech) and served as a template for the amplification of the complete ORF of hCINAP with oligonucleotides 1 and 3. The amplified product was digested with EcoRI/SalI, cloned into Bluescript, and sequenced. For semiquantitative RT-PCR, poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from human tissues or human cell lines with the Oligotex mRNA mini kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To evaluate the efficacy of RT-PCR conditions with the various tissues, and compare the hybridization efficiency of the two sets of oligonucleotides used for the experiments shown in Fig. 3 (B and E) (one set specific for the hCINAP transcript and two sets specific for the TAFIID32 transcript), control reactions with plasmid DNA were performed. Reactions were carried out in parallel with identical conditions, using 20 ng of plasmid as template with either TAFIID32- or hCINAP-specific oligonucleotides of the same concentration at 18, 23, and 28 cycles. The results indicated that, in the linear range of the reaction (achieved between 18 and 23 cycles), the concentration of two types of products is comparable (supplementary Fig. S2). Semiquantitative RT-PCR was therefore subsequently performed with the same PCR conditions (except for the increased number of cycles that were necessary to detect the amplified product from cDNA samples). Control reactions using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific oligonucleotides were run in parallel as internal standards. For the amplification of human genomic sequences, purified high molecular weight human genomic DNA (Roche Applied Science) was used as a template and PCR reactions, with a variety of oligonucleotides (see “Oligonucleotides”) were carried out with the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Applied Science), following the exact reaction and amplification instructions of the manufacturer. PCR products were directly cloned into vector pCR2.1, using the Original T/A cloning kit (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing was performed by the EMBL sequencing service. Construction of Bacterial Expression and Mammalian Transfection Vectors—The bacterial expression vector pRSETB-hCINAP was constructed by an in-frame EcoRI/SalI insertion of hCINAP, excised from Bluescript (see previous section) to vector pRSETB (Invitrogen). This created a 5′ His6-tagged version of hCINAP. The same hCINAP insert was also ligated to expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate GST-tagged hCINAP. To create YFP-hCINAP, we made a vector fragment derived from pEYFP-C1 (BD biosciences) by digestion with BglII and HindIII. An insert fragment containing hCINAP was derived from pRSETB-hCINAP by digestion with BglII and HindIII. Bacterial Expression and Purification of His6-hCINAP—Competent BL21-pLysS strain of E. coli was transformed with pRSETBhCINAP. Large cultures were induced with 1 mm IPTG during exponential growth in LB at 37 °C and harvested 3 h post-induction. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole, and 1 tablet/50 ml of Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), mechanically lysed with a French press and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The insoluble pellet was resuspended in buffer B (as per lysis buffer but with 100 mm NaH2PO4 instead of NaCl), containing 6 m guanidinium HCl, and the recombinant protein was purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For animal immunization, the purified protein was dialyzed extensively against PBS. The same construct was used for the production of soluble protein, suitable for enzyme kinetic experiments, with culture growth at 30 °C for 5 h after induction with 0.5 mm IPTG. This resulted in the production of 30-40 mg of soluble His6-hCINAP/liter. The recombinant protein was affinity purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, followed by gel filtration through a Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and desalted by dialysis. It was stored at -20°C in a buffer containing 12.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50% glycerol for use in ATPase assays. ATPase Assays with His6-hCINAP—The ATP hydrolysis activity of hCINAP was measured by an assay in which ADP production is coupled to the β-NADH oxidation by pyruvate kinase and l-lactic dehydrogenase (18Skamnaki V.T. Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Lowe E.D Lowe G. Oikonomakos N.G. Johnson L.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14718-14730Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The rate of β-NADH disappearance was monitored at 340 nm, and all enzymatic reactions were performed at 30 °C. The final assay mixture was 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 65 mm KCl, 0.2 mm β-NADH, 1 mm phenyl enol pyruvate, 5 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase (Sigma), 20 units/ml l-lactic dehydrogenase (Sigma), 3 μg/ml CINAP, and 0.05-1 mm ATP. Control samples, containing reaction mixture without CINAP, were used to subtract background ATP hydrolysis, mainly due to the activity of pyruvate kinase. Kinetic data were analyzed with the use of the nonlinear regression program GraFit. Calculations of molarity were based on a molar extinction coefficient of 6220 m-1 cm-1 for β-NADH at 340 nm. In Vitro Co-selection Experiments—Plasmid pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) was used for expression of hCINAP as a GST fusion protein and pET32a+ (Novagen) was used for expression of p80-coilin as a His6 and thioredoxin fusion. Bacterial expression was carried out as described in the previous section with culture growth at 25 °C. Two-milliliter aliquots of bacterial cultures were collected 3 h post-induction, bacterial pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of binding buffer (PBS, containing 1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 1 tablet/50 ml Complete protease inhibitor, Roche Applied Science) and lysed by brief sonication. After clarification of bacterial lysates (13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min), GST-hCINAP, and His6-coilin were mixed in the presence of 0, 1, 2, and 3 mm ATP, respectively, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with constant agitation. An equal volume of pre-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were then added into each protein mix, and the solution was incubated with gentle agitation at room temperature for 30 min. The beads with bound complexes were collected by centrifugation at 500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant (unbound fraction) was saved for analysis. Beads were washed with ice-cold binding buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed, together with the unbound fractions, by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting. In Vivo Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the pEYFP-hCINAP construct (details below) using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of plasmid DNA was used per 10-cm dish, 18 h after transfection the dishes were rinsed 2× with warm PBS, and cells were lysed with 0.5 ml/dish Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 1% w/v deoxycholic acid, 0.1% w/v SDS, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 tablet/10 ml protease inhibitor Complete, Roche Applied Science). The cell lysate was scraped into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, and the DNA was sheared to reduce the viscosity by processing with a QIAshredder (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lysate was precleared by incubating with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C. After brief centrifugation to remove the protein G-Sepharose, the precleared extract was transferred to a new tube, and then 1 μl of anti-green fluorescent protein monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) was added. Incubation at 4 °C for 1 h allowed formation of immune complexes, which were subsequently recovered by adding protein G-Sepharose and rotating overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads containing the immune complexes were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation and washed. Finally, proteins in both the supernatant and pellet fraction were denatured with SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the blot was probed with an antibody against coilin followed by incubation with a second anti-rabbit antibody coupled to HRP (Pierce, 1:5000). Standard Molecular Biology and Protein Analysis Techniques—All molecular biology techniques (cDNA library screening, plasmid purifications, restriction digests, ligations, blue/white bacterial colony selection, Northern blotting, and others) were performed according to standard procedures (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE on a mini-gel system (Protean, Bio-Rad) or using gradient “Novex” gels from Invitrogen was essentially as described (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Western blotting was carried out using standard techniques and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system, ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences). HeLa nuclear extracts were obtained commercially from the Computer Cell Culture Center (Mons, Belgium) Transient Transfections of Tagged hCINAP in HeLa Cell Line—Exponentially growing HeLa cultures were harvested and replated onto coverslips in 60-mm diameter dishes, 24 h prior to transfection. Transfections were carried out with the DOTAP reagent (Roche Applied Science) or with Effectene (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions in each case or with calcium phosphate precipitation (lamondlab.com/f6protocols.htm). Coverslips were retrieved for immunofluorescence 16-20 h after removal of the transfection medium. Immunolabeling of Cultured Cells—For hCINAP immunofluorescence, using the antiserum to hCINAP recombinant protein or the anti-peptide antiserum, cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PHEM buffer (30 mm Hepes, 65 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 10 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2) for 10 min and permeabilized for 15 min with 0.2% SDS in the same buffer. Transfected cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PHEM buffer for 10 min. They were quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized for 10 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PHEM buffer, and blocked with 2% BSA, 2% fetal calf serum, 0.2% fish skin gelatin in PBS (“blocking mix”) for 30 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies, in PBS containing 5% blocking mix, for 1 h at room temperature. For double labeling, incubation was carried out sequentially for each of the primary antibodies and secondary antibodies were applied as a mixture. Coverslips were mounted with Mowiol (Merck, Germany), containing 100 mg/ml DABCO (Sigma, Germany) as an anti-fading agent. Confocal and Epifluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescent preparations were analyzed on the EMBL Compact Confocal Microscope (21Stelzer E.H. Wacker I. De Mey J.R. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 145-152PubMed Google Scholar) or a Zeiss Axiophot light microscope. Excitation wavelengths of 476 nm (for fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled antibodies) or 594 nm (Texas Red-coupled antibodies) were selected. Some images presented in Figs. 5 and 8A were recorded on a Zeiss Axiovert S100 2TV DeltaVision Restoration microscope (Applied Precision) using either a Zeiss Plan-apochromat (100×, 1.40 numerical aperture objective) or a Zeiss Plan-neofluar (40×, 1.30 numerical aperture objective) and a CCD-1300-Y/HS camera (Roper Scientific). Images were captured and processed by constrained iterative deconvolution using SoftWorx (Applied Precision) and prepared as illustrations using Adobe Photoshop. Two-dimensional images presented here are maximal intensity projections of three-dimensional volumes along the optical axis.FIGURE 8Overexpression of hCINAP affects the number of Cajal bodies per nucleus. A, fluorescence micrographs of HeLa cells transfected with either YFP-hCINAP (A1, A2, and A3) or unfused YFP control (B1, B2, and B3). Tagged proteins were detected by fluorescence (A1 and B1), whereas coilin was detected using immunofluorescence (A2 and B2) with a rabbit anti-coilin antibody as described under “Materials and Methods.” The merged YFP and coilin images are presented in A3 and B3. Untransfected nuclei show the characteristic coilin staining pattern in both A2 and B2 with both bright foci (arrows) and a diffuse nucleoplasmic staining. Transfected nuclei, as assessed by detection of the fluorescent proteins in A1 and B1 (dashed outline in A2 and B2), only show a reduction in the number of Cajal bodies when transfected with YFP-hCINAP (A2) and not YFP control (B2, see arrowheads for examples of Cajal bodies in a cell transfected with YFP control). Scale bars in all images are 20 μm. B, three-dimensional images of random fields of cells were collected and presented as maximum intensity projections to allow all Cajal bodies within nuclei to be displayed onto a two-dimensional space. The number of Cajal bodies (see A for example) were counted from over 200 nuclei resulting from more than 20 images from each of three conditions: untransfected control (top graph); YFP alone transfected control (bottom graph); YFP-hCINAP transfected (middle graph). The results are displayed as frequency distributions showing the number of Cajal bodies in each nucleus (x-axis) and the number of nuclei (y-axis). Untransfected control nuclei (8.0 ± 0.23 Cajal bodies) (average ± S.E., n = 267) and YFP alone control nuclei (8.5 ± 0.21, n = 288) do not have significantly different numbers of Cajal bodies, whereas those nuclei transfected with YFP-hCINAP (3.3 ± 0.16, n = 221) have a reduced number of Cajal bodies per nucleus. This difference was confirmed to be statistically significant by performing a one-tailed t test (p < 0.0001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify novel coilin interacting proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed with a HeLa cDNA library, using human coilin as the bait. Two million colonies were screened and ninety positive clones identified, as previously described (10Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Science. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 22Nachury M.V. Ryder U.W. Lamond A.I. Weis K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Among the ninety positive clones four overlapping cDNAs, encoding the same open reading frame, were isolated. An apparently full-length cDNA clone encoding this protein was used to quantify its interaction with coilin using a liquid β-galactosidase yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1A). This showed a strong interaction of the hCINAP protein with coilin relative to the negative controls. To ensure that the positive clones from the HeLa library encode a bona fide human protein, the transcript was amplified by PCR from human placental cDNA (Fig. 1B). This yielded a cDNA amplification product of identical size to the HeLa cDNA clone (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2 and 4). DNA sequence analysis showed that both the original HeLa and the placental cDNA clones were identical. The sequences were deposited in the GenBank™/EBI data base as accession numbers AJ878880 and AJ878881. We have termed the resulting gene product hCINAP (human coilin interacting nuclear ATPase protein), which is a 172-amino acid protein of molecular mass 20,048 Da. Fig. 1C shows the full protein sequence of hCINAP aligned with putative orthologues from other species spanning the major eukaryotic divide, including plants, flies, worms, and yeast. This shows that hCINAP is highly conserved from human to yeast across its entire length. Thus there is a 22% identity and ∼46% overall similarity in amino acid sequence conserved between all orthologues in human, fly, nematode, plants, and yeast. A direct comparison of"
https://openalex.org/W2043352206,"Protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) is a plasma serpin, which can rapidly inactivate factor Xa (fXa) in the presence of protein Z (PZ), negatively charged phospholipids, and Ca2+. To investigate the mechanism by which ZPI inactivates fXa, we expressed the serpin in mammalian cells and characterized its reactivity with both wild-type and selected mutants of fXa that 1) contained substitutions in the autolysis loop and the heparin binding exosite, 2) lacked the first EGF-like domain (fXa-des-EGF-1), or 3) contained the Gla domain of protein C (fXa/PC-Gla). Inhibition studies in both the presence and absence of PZ revealed that Arg-143, Lys-147, and Arg-154 of the autolysis loop and Lys-96, Lys-169, and Lys-236 of the heparin binding exosite are required for recognition of ZPI, with Arg-143 being essential for the interaction. Similar studies with fXa-des-EGF-1 and fXa/PC-Gla suggested that protein-protein interaction with either the Gla or the EGF-1 domain may not play a dominant role in the PZ-dependent recognition of fXa by the serpin on phospholipid vesicles. Further studies showed that an inactive Ser-195 to Ala mutant of fXa effectively competes with wild-type fXa for binding to the non-serpin inhibitors tissue factor pathway inhibitor and recombinant tick anticoagulant peptide, but does not compete for binding to ZPI. This suggests that the catalytic residue of fXa is required for interaction with ZPI.

It circulates in plasma as a light and heavy chain molecule held together by a disulfide bond (5Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal light chain contains the non-catalytic γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) and two epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains, while the C-terminal heavy chain contains the trypsin-like catalytic domain of the molecule (2Furie B.

The proteolytic activity of fXa in plasma is regulated by three physiological inhibitors, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) (6Broze Jr., G.J. Girard T.J. Novotny W.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7539-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), anti-thrombin (AT) (7Damus P.S. Hicks M. Rosenberg R.D.

TFPI is a multidomain Kunitz-type inhibitor that regulates the coagulation cascade by the fXa-dependent inhibition of the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex during the initial stages of the clotting cascade (6Broze Jr., G.J. Girard T.J. Novotny W.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7539-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It functions by binding to the active site pocket of fXa by the second Kunitz domain, and thereafter binding tightly to the active site of the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex via the first Kunitz domain, thereby rendering both proteases inactive in a quaternary complex (6Broze Jr., G.J. Girard T.J. Novotny W.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7539-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). AT, on the other hand, is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) that regulates the proteolytic activity of fXa and other coagulation proteases by covalently binding to the active site through an exposed reactive center loop, and undergoing a conformational change, which leads to entrapment of the target protease in inactive and SDS-stable complex with the serpin (13Olson S.T.

Streusand V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8385-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). ZPI is also a serpin, and there is some evidence that it interacts with the active site pocket of fXa by a similar covalent mechanism (11Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, ZPI does not form a SDS-stable complex with fXa, suggesting that, unlike the AT-fXa complex, the ZPI-fXa complex has a higher dissociation constant (11Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This has been previously documented by the reversibility of the ZPI-fXa reaction and the observation that the activity of fXa is partially recovered following the incubation of the ZPI-fXa complex with EDTA at 37 °C (11Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both AT and ZPI require cofactors for their effective interaction with fXa. Thus, the AT interaction with the heparin-like glycosaminoglycans on the surface of the endothelium (16de Agostini A.I. Watkins S.C. Slayter H.S. Youssoufian H. Rosenberg R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and the ZPI complex formation with PZ on membrane phospholipids in the presence of Ca2+ (9Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9250-9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) is required for the ability of both serpins to effectively interact with fXa. In the case of AT, the mechanism of the cofactor function of heparin in promoting the serpin inhibition of fXa has been extensively studied (14Jin L. Abrahams J. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 17Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the binding of a unique pentasaccharide fragment of heparin to a basic helical structure of AT induces a conformational change in the serpin that leads to a better recognition and a high affinity interaction of the serpin with fXa (18Belzar K.J. Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Gettins P.G.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8551-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, previous studies have indicated that the basic residues of the autolysis loop (143–154 in chymotrypsin numbering (Ref. 19Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) play a key role in recognition of the heparin-activated conformation of AT by fXa (20Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition to promotion of the AT-fXa reaction by this allosteric mechanism, full-length heparins are also known to bind to a basic exosite on fXa in the presence of Ca2+, thereby bridging both the serpin and the protease in one complex and further contributing to the promotion of the reaction by a template mechanism (21Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16824-16827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Rezaie A.R. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12083-12090Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Unlike AT, it is not known how ZPI interacts with fXa and unlike the cofactor function of heparin, it is not known how PZ promotes the inhibition of fXa by ZPI on membrane surfaces in the presence of Ca2+. PZ is a vitamin K-dependent plasma protein with a domain organization identical to that of fXa, and thus capable of interacting with negatively charged phospholipid membranes via its Gla domain; however, it merely functions as a cofactor in the reaction and lacks any catalytic function (23Sejima H. Hayashi T. Deyashiki Y. Nishioka J. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the interaction of fXa with PZ on the membrane surface is required for the protease recognition of ZPI. To investigate these questions, we expressed ZPI in mammalian cells and following purification, characterized its properties in inhibition reactions with wild-type and selected mutants of fXa containing substitutions in several exposed surface loops (exosites) on the catalytic domain, known to be critical for the macromolecular substrate and inhibitor specificity of fXa and other coagulation enzymes. Moreover, the role of the non-catalytic domain of fXa for the ZPI-PZ interaction was examined using two mutants of fXa from one of which the first EGF-like domain was deleted (fXa-des-EGF-1). In the other mutant, the Gla domain of fXa was substituted with the corresponding domain of protein C (fXa/PC-Gla). Recombinant ZPI, similar to plasma ZPI, rapidly inactivated fXa in the presence of PZ with a second-order inhibition rate constant of 6.2 × 105 m–1 s–1. A similar high reactivity for ZPI was observed with fXa mutants of the 39, 60, and 70–80 loops. However, the reactivity of ZPI with the autolysis loop mutant of fXa was markedly impaired and Arg-143 was identified to be essential for interaction with the serpin both in the absence and presence of PZ. Similarly, three Ala substitution mutants of heparin binding exosite of fXa (K96A, K169A, and K236A) exhibited diminished reactivity with ZPI both in the absence and presence of PZ. A near normal cofactor effect for PZ with both fXa-des-EGF-1 and fXa/PC-Gla suggested that neither the Gla nor the EGF-1 domain plays a dominant role in the PZ-dependent recognition of fXa by the serpin on phospholipid vesicles. Finally, an inactive Ser-195 to Ala mutant of fXa effectively competed with wild-type fXa for binding to TFPI and recombinant tick anticoagulant peptide (rTAP), but failed to compete for binding to ZPI. These results suggest that, similar to other serine protease-serpin reactions, the catalytic Ser-195 is required for a high affinity interaction of fXa with ZPI. Construction, Mutagenesis, and Expression of Recombinant Proteins —ZPI cDNA (obtained from Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) was subcloned into the StuI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites of the RSV-PL4 expression/purification vector system and expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) as described (24Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This vector contains the sequence of the transferrin signal peptide for secretion, the sequence of a 12-residue epitope for a Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody, HPC4, for purification and a neomycin gene for the G418-resistant selection in mammalian cells (24Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following transfer of the vector into HEK-293 cells, several G418-resistant clones were selected and examined for ZPI expression by Western blot analysis using the HPC4 monoclonal antibody. A clone positive for ZPI expression was identified, expanded, and 20 liters of cell culture supernatant were collected, concentrated, and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the HPC4 antibody linked to Affi-gel 10 (Bio-Rad) as described (24Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HPC4 eluate was further chromatographed on a size exclusion column using Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences). The ZPI concentration was calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar absorption coefficient of 31525 m–1 cm–1, calculated based on the equation ϵ(280) = (#Trp × 5500) + (#Tyr × 1490) + (#cystine × 125) as described (25Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). The fX mutant in which the exon coding for the Gla domain (Ala-1 to Asn-38) of fX was exchanged with the corresponding domain of protein C was prepared by PCR methods and expressed in the same expression system as described for wild-type fX (20Manithody C.

The inactive Ser-195 → Ala (S195A) substitution mutant of fX was expressed in the same expression/purification vector system (20Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The accuracy of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing prior to their expression in mammalian cells. All fX mutants containing the fully γ-carboxylated proteins were purified to homogeneity (28Chen L. Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), activated by the fX-activating enzyme from Russell's viper venom (RVV-X), purified on heparin-Sepharose column and active site titrated with known concentrations of AT as described (20Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) was from Monsanto Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Recombinant tick anticoagulant peptide (rTAP) was a generous gift from Dr. G. Vlasuk (Corvas International Inc., San Diego, CA), and human plasma-derived ZPI (pZPI) was a generous gift from Dr. Mary Jo Heeb (Scripps Research Institute). Protein Z (PZ) and RVV-X were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction). Phospholipid vesicles containing 80% phosphatidylcholine and 20% phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) were prepared as described (31Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chromogenic substrates, Spectrozyme FXa (SpFXa, MeO-CO-d-cyclohexylglycyl-Gly-Arg-p-nitroaniline-dihydrochloride) was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT), and S2765 (N-α-benzyloxycarbonyl-d-Arg-Gly-Arg-p-nitroaniline-dihydrochloride) was purchased from Kabi Pharmacia/Chromogenix (Franklin, OH). Inhibition Assays—The time course and concentration dependence of fXa inhibition by ZPI was studied both in the absence and presence of PZ on PC/PS vesicles under pseudo first-order conditions as described (21Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16824-16827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Rezaie A.R. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12083-12090Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the absence of PZ, fXa derivatives (1 nm) were incubated with ZPI (100–250 nm) on PC/PS vesicles (25 μm) in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 5 mm Ca2+ (TBS/Ca2+) for 30–120 min in 50-μl volumes in 96-well polystyrene plates at room temperature. The presence of BSA in the reaction did not influence the reactivity of the serpin with the protease. In the presence of PZ, the reaction conditions were the same except that all proteases (0.5 nm) were incubated with ZPI (10–80 nm) in complex with a saturating concentration of PZ (50–150 nm) for 15 s to 50 min on PC/PS vesicles (25 μm) in the same TBS buffer. The inactivation reactions were stopped by addition of 50 μl of S2765 (0.25 mm final) in TBS containing 50 mm EDTA, and the remaining enzyme activity was measured with a Vmax Kinetics Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) at 405 nm. The cofactor concentration dependence of PZ-mediated fXa inhibition by ZPI indicated that PZ concentrations are saturating under these conditions. The observed pseudo first-order (kobs) rate constants were calculated from a first-order rate equation, and the second-order rate constants (k2) were calculated from the slope of the linear plot of kobs values versus ZPI concentrations as described (21Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16824-16827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Rezaie A.R. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12083-12090Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Competitive Inhibition Studies—The competitive effect of the inactive S195A mutant of fXa on the wild-type fXa inhibition by the ZPI-PZ complex, and the non-serpin inhibitors TFPI and rTAP was studied using the same amidolytic activity assay described above. In this case, the inhibition of fXa (1 nm) on PC/PS vesicles (25 μm) by each inhibitor (5 nm TFPI and rTAP, and 10 nm ZPI) was monitored in the presence of increasing concentrations of fXa S195A (0–200 nm) in TBS/Ca2+. Following 10 min of incubation at room temperature, 50 μl of SpFXa (0.5 mm in EDTA) was added to each well, and the remaining activity of fXa was measured as described above. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Human recombinant ZPI (rZPI) was expressed in HEK-293 cells using the RSV-PL4 expression/purification vector system as described (24Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). rZPI expressed by this system contains a 12-residue epitope for the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody HPC4 at its N-terminal domain for easy purification. Following passage of the rZPI supernatants through the immobilized HPC4 antibody, the substitution of Ca2+ with EDTA in the wash buffer was sufficient to elute the serpin from the antibody column (24Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HPC4 eluate was further purified by size exclusion chromatography, and its concentration was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We have previously utilized this expression/purification vector system for expression of other serpins including AT (32Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and protein C inhibitor (33Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both serpins expressed in this system, have exhibited identical activities as their wild-type counterparts both in the absence and presence of related cofactors, suggesting that the N-terminal HPC4 epitope does not interfere with the inhibitory properties of either serpin (32Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 33Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This is also true for the ZPI inhibition of fXa because as shown in TABLE ONE, rZPI inhibited fXa with k2 values, which were comparable to those of pZPI in both the absence and presence of PZ. SDS-PAGE analysis under non-reducing conditions suggested that rZPI migrates as a single band with an expected molecular mass of ∼72 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 1), as reported previously for this protein (9Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9250-9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results further suggested that fXa does not cleave ZPI either in the absence or presence of PZ; however, it does not also form an SDS-stable complex with the serpin under both conditions (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). This is consistent with previous results in the literature (11Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the fXa derivatives were also expressed in a similar HPC4-based expression/purification vector system and the fully γ-carboxylated proteins were isolated as described (20Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Chen L. Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the case of the fX expression system, however, the construct has been prepared such that the HPC4 epitope replaces the first 12 residues of the zymogen activation peptide on the heavy chain of the molecule, and because the activation peptide of fX is cleaved off during activation by RVV-X, the N-terminal HPC4 epitope is removed along with the activation peptide from all fXa derivatives. Thus, with the exception of specific mutations, all fXa derivatives have identical amino acid sequences as the plasma-derived fXa. The characterization of all fXa mutants with the exception of fXa/PC-Gla has been described previously (20Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Manithody C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 28Chen L.

Open table in a new tab FXa Inhibition by ZPI—The extent of the reactivity of fXa with ZPI was evaluated both in the absence and presence of PZ on PC/PS vesicles and in TBS/Ca2+ under pseudo first-order conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both time course and concentration dependence of the inhibition reactions indicated that the inhibitory activity of ZPI toward fXa is not complete, but rather reaches to a maximum of 80% inhibition and thereafter no further decline in the amidolytic activity of fXa is observed. Previously, a similar 20% remaining activity for fXa in the presence of high concentrations of ZPI has been observed in a similar amidolytic activity assay (9Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9250-9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The reason for the incomplete inhibitory activity of ZPI toward fXa in the amidolytic activity assays is not known. One possibility is that because ZPI exhibits reversibility in reaction with fXa (11Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the addition of the chromogenic substrate in EDTA and subsequent dilution of the reaction leads to the dissociation of active fXa from the inhibitory complex (11Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative possibilities including differential reactivity for α and β forms of fXa with the ZPI-PZ complex have been postulated in the past (9Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9250-9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the exact cause of an incomplete inhibition of fXa by the ZPI-PZ complex, as measured by an amidolytic activity assay remains an open question. To minimize the effect of an incomplete inhibition of fXa by ZPI, all rate constants were derived from inhibition reactions in which ∼40–60% of the enzyme activity was inhibited. The second-order inhibition rate constants were calculated from the slopes of linear plots of kobs values as a function of increasing concentrations of ZPI in complex with a saturating concentration of PZ (Fig. 2). The values presented in TABLE ONE indicated that, rZPI similar to pZPI, inhibits fXa with k2 values of 1.6 × 103m–1 s–1 in the absence and 6.2 × 105m–1 s–1 in the presence of PZ on"
https://openalex.org/W2012101251,"CD59 is a 77-amino acid membrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in regulating the terminal pathway of complement by inhibiting formation of the cytolytic membrane attack complex (MAC or C5b-9). The MAC is formed by the self assembly of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and multiple C9 molecules, with CD59 functioning by binding C5b-8 and C5b-9 in the assembling complex. We performed a scanning alanine mutagenesis screen of residues 16–57, a region previously identified to contain the C8/C9 binding interface. We have also created an improved NMR model from previously published data for structural understanding of CD59. Based on the scanning mutagenesis data, refined models, and additional site-specific mutations, we identified a binding interface that is much broader than previously thought. In addition to identifying substitutions that decreased CD59 activity, a surprising number of substitutions significantly enhanced CD59 activity. Because CD59 has significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions, we investigated further the ability to enhance CD59 activity by additional mutagenesis studies. Based on the enhanced activity of membrane-bound mutant CD59 molecules, clinically relevant soluble mutant CD59-based proteins were prepared and shown to have up to a 3-fold increase in complement inhibitory activity."

Recent studies indicate that the non-reducing end of heparan sulfate might be the place where fibroblast growth factor signaling complex forms. The non-reducing end also changes with heparanase digestion and, thus, might serve as a marker for tumor pathology. Using high performance liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry, we have identified and characterized the non-reducing end of bovine kidney heparan sulfate. We find that the non-reducing end region is highly sulfated and starts with a glucuronic acid (GlcA) residue.

Defects in HS can cause complete losses of FGF as well as Hedgehog and Wingless signaling pathways and lead to severe abnormality in embryonic development (14Perrimon N. Hacker U. Development. 2004; 131 (author reply 2511–2513): 2509-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Lin X. Development. 2004; 131: 6009-6021Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). HS also plays important roles in cell migration and cancer cell metastasis (16Sanderson R.D. Yang Y. Suva L.J. Kelly T. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Despite these known structural information and biological functions of HS, the non-reducing end (NRE) of HS has not been studied. Assuming that each HS chain has a similar content of sulfation, the fact that the reducing end of HS is devoid of sulfation (7Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Knecht J. Cifonelli J.A. Dorfman A. J. Biol.

Steward W.P. Hampson I.N. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) suggests that the NRE of HS might be sulfated and assume biological functions. Indeed, there are indications that HS uses its NRE to direct the FGF signaling complex formation (11Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 13Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Yabe T. Kuberan B. Beeler D.L. Love A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 41921-41929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Consequently, an FGF signaling complex model where two molecules each of FGF and FGF receptor bind to the NREs of two approaching HS chains has been proposed (13Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Yabe T. Kuberan B. Beeler D.L. Love A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17121-17129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Whether the NRE of HS has the ability to support the complex formation relies on its structure. It is known that heparanase activity is closely related to the metastatic potential of tumor-derived cells (19Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Because heparanase can trim off the original NRE of cell surface HS, this correlation might be caused by changing the NRE of cell surface HS. Heparanase is an endo-glucuronidase, and its action on HS will release oligosaccharides from the NRE and expose a glucosamine residue at the newly formed NRE (20Pikas D.S. Li J.P. Vlodavsky I. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18770-18777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This change on the NRE of HS may possibly be detected by mass spectrometry, because different end structures could have different molecular masses. The identification of the NRE of HS may also allow us to establish a new strategy to sequence HS. The positions of internal residues on a HS chain can be assigned based on their distances to the NRE. Previously, HS sequencing strategies were established on purified heparin/HS oligosaccharides (21Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. Science. 1999; 286: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 22Turnbull J.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 129-139PubMed Google Scholar, 23Stringer S.E. Kandola B.S. Pye D.A.

One shortcoming of these strategies is that the localization of these oligosaccharides on the whole chain of HS could not be pinpointed. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of the NRE of bovine kidney HS. Materials—Bovine kidney heparan sulfate, heparinase, and heparitinase I and II were obtained from Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA). These enzymes were reconstituted at 0.3 milliunits/μl according to the manufacturer's direction. β-d-Glucuronidase was obtained from ProZyme (San Leandro, CA). HS sulfotransferase 6-OST-1 was cloned, expressed, and purified with a baculovirus expression system as described previously (25Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Lawrence R. Lech M. Liu J. Davis J.C. Shriver Z. Sasisekharan R. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42311-42321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Stable isotope 34S was from Isonics Corporation (Columbia, MD). 34S-labeled 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate was prepared as described previously (26Wu Z.L. Lech M. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1861-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Stable Isotope Labeling of Heparan Sulfate—34S incorporation by 6-OST-1 was done as described previously (26Wu Z.L. Lech M. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1861-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The labeling buffer (2×) contained 50 mm MES (pH 7.0), 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 5mm MnCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.075 mg/ml protamine chloride, and 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. To label HS with 34S, 10 μg of HS, 10 μl of labeling buffer, 1 μl of 6-OST-1, 2 μl of 34S-labeled 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (3 mm), and an appropriate amount of water were mixed to the total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The modified HS was purified on a DEAE column. Heparan Sulfate Lyase Digestion—For analyzing HS end structures, HS samples with or without 34S labeling were digested thoroughly with heparinase, heparitinase I, and heparitinase II individually or in combination at 37 °C for 2 h. For each case, 10 μg of an HS sample was digested in 20 μl of a buffer containing 40 mm NH4Ac (pH 7.0), 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 milliunit each of the enzymes. One μg of the digestion product was then used for LC/MS analysis. Heparan Sulfate Oligosaccharide β-Glucuronidase Digestion—Briefly, 10 μg of HS lyase digest was treated with 1 μlof β-glucuronidase (50 units) in 15 μl of digestion buffer (0.05 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The reaction was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Capillary Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry—High performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis was described previously (26Wu Z.L. Lech M. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1861-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27Kuberan B. Lech M. Zhang L. Wu Z.L. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 8707-8718Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Separations were performed on an Ultimate capillary high performance liquid chromatography work station (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) employing dibutylamine as an ion-pairing agent. A gradient elution was performed using a binary solvent system composed of water (eluent A) and 70% aqueous methanol (eluent B), both containing 8 mm acetic acid and 5 mm ion-pairing agent. High performance liquid chromatography separations were performed on a 0.3 × 250-mm C18 column at a rate of 5 μl/min and a sample volume of 6.3 μl. The elution profile was 0% eluent B for 5 min, 6% eluent B for 19 min, 18% eluent B for 17 min, 34% eluent B for 13 min, and 55% eluent B for 16 min. After each run, the column was washed with 90% eluent B for 15 min and equilibrated with 100% eluent A for 28 min. Mass spectra were acquired on a Mariner BioSpectrometry work station electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Nitrogen was used as a desolvation gas as well as a nebulizer. Conditions for electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry were as follows: nebulizer gas (N2) flow rate, 1 liter/min; nozzle temperature, 140 °C; drying gas (N2) flow rate, 0.6 liters/min; spray tip potential, 2.8 kV; and nozzle potential, 70 V. Negative ion spectra were acquired every 4 s by scanning m/z from 40 to 4000. Total ion chromatograms and mass spectra were processed with the Data Explorer software version 3.0. Theoretical Calculation of the Monoisotopic m/z Value of a Terminal Oligosaccharide Released from the Non-reducing End of an HS chain by Bacterial Lyases—An oligosaccharide released from internal sections of an HS chain with bacterial lyases begins with a Δ4,5-uronic acid (ΔUA); however, the terminal oligosaccharide released from the NRE of an HS chain should begin with a saturated residue (Fig. 1). If the NRE of an HS chain is a uronic acid (UA), the molecular mass of the terminal oligosaccharide will be 18.01 Da (addition of H2O1) more than that of its ΔUA-containing internal counterpart; if the NRE of an HS chain is a GlcN, the molecular mass of the terminal oligosaccharide will be at least 181.09 Da (addition of C6H15O5N1) more than that of the ΔUA-containing internal counterpart (Fig. 1). In negative mode mass spectrometry, the molecular formula of a ΔUA-containing oligosaccharide can be identified with Equation 1 (26Wu Z.L. Lech M. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1861-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), m/z=(337.09n+42.01p+79.96q-z)/z(Eq. 1) where n is the number of disaccharides, p is the number of acetyl groups, and q is the number of sulfates. The molecular formula of a terminal oligosaccharide with a UA at its NRE can be identified with Equation 2, m/z=(337.09n+42.01p+79.96q-z+18.01)/z(Eq. 2) and the molecular formula of a terminal oligosaccharide with a GlcN at its NRE can be identified with Equation 3. m/z=(337.09n+42.01p+79.96q-z+181.09)/z(Eq. 3) Identification of the Non-reducing End of Bovine Kidney HS—A bovine kidney HS sample was first subject to complete digestion with HS lyase mixture and then analyzed with LC/MS (Fig. 2). Most of the m/z values in the integrated mass spectrum had solutions with Equation 1 (TABLE ONE) and therefore should belong to internal oligosaccharides. Only m/z 514.05 had a solution with Equation 2, suggesting that it belongs to a terminal oligosaccharide with a UA at the NRE. This terminal oligosaccharide was then designated as a dp2-2S* to distinguish it from internal disaccharides dp2-2S at m/z 496.04 (Fig. 2B). Because the NRE UA had no preceding glucosamine residue that was required for its modification (1Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar), this UA was likely a GlcA. The following GlcN residue could not be labeled with 6-OSTs on the whole chain of HS (supplemental Fig. 1, available in the on-line version of this article), suggesting that it might have been sulfated at its 6-O position. Also, considering the rareness and positioning of 3-O-sulfate and free amino group (28Xu D. Tiwari V. Xia G. Clement C. Shukla D. Liu J. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Westling C. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49247-49255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), this dp2-2S* was likely to be GlcA-GlcNS6S. No m/z value was found to have solution with Equation 3, suggesting no HS chain terminated on GlcN. Because the dp2-2S and dp2-2S* had similar chemical structures, the ratio of their m/z signals would quantitatively reflect their molar ratio. This ratio was found to be ∼15 (Fig. 2B), suggesting each bovine kidney HS chain contains ∼15 dp2-2S.TABLE ONEThe oligosaccharides in Fig. 2m/zElution timeznpqFormulamin378.133.01110dp2-1Ac458.1016.61111dp2-1Ac-1S416.0820.8, 25.61101dp2-1S496.0438.3, 39.7, 41.51102dp2-2S514.0537.61102dp2-2S*576.0052.3, 53.31103dp2-3S705.16aDibutylamine (DBA; monoisotopic mass 129.15 Da) adduct of dp2-3S.53.31103dp2-3S:1DBA416.0837.22202dp4-2S456.0656.62203dp4-3S496.0464.22204dp4-4S536.0366.2, 66.82205dp4-5S437.0952.62212dp4-1Ac-2S477.0758.92213dp4-1Ac-3S517.0564.82214dp4-1Ac-4S645.6361.72313dp6-1Ac-2S685.6165.42314dp6-1Ac-3Sa Dibutylamine (DBA; monoisotopic mass 129.15 Da) adduct of dp2-3S. Open table in a new tab Confirmation of the Non-reducing End by Exo-glycosidase Treatment—To confirm that the dp2-2S* did begin with a GlcA residue, the above HS lysate was further digested with β-d-glucuronidase and analyzed with LC/MS. An extracted ion current chromatogram was obtained at m/z 514.05 and 576.00 from the total ion chromatogram (Fig. 3). m/z 576.00 belonged to internal trisulfated disaccharides dp2-3S and caused two peaks in the extracted ion current chromatogram. m/z 514.05 caused a single peak at elution time of 37.6 min. Because the dp2-3S began with ΔUA and was resistant to β-d-glucuronidase digestion, it could serve as a control. The β-d-glucuronidase treatment eliminated the peak of dp2-2S* but not the peaks of the dp2-3S (Fig. 3B), indicating that the dp2-2S* did start with a GlcA residue. Determination of the Non-reducing End Structure of HS at the Tetrasaccharide Level—Bovine kidney HS samples were first labeled with 34S by 6-OST-1 and then digested with various lyases individually or in combination. It was found that heparinase was able to release tetrasaccharides from the NRE. When the heparinase digest was analyzed with LC/MS, peaks at m/z 465.07, 486.08, 505.05, and 545.03 were found in the integrated mass spectrum (Fig. 4). These values had solutions with Equation 2 and corresponded to NRE terminal tetrasaccharides dp4-3S*, dp4-1Ac-3S*, dp4-4S*, and dp4-5S* respectively (TABLE TWO). Corresponding internal tetrasaccharides dp4-3S, dp4-1Ac-3S, dp4-4S, and dp4-5S (m/z 456.07, 477.07, 496.05, and 536.03, respectively) were also detected.TABLE TWOThe oligosaccharides in Fig. 4m/zElution time (minutes)znpqFormulamin416.0358.42202dp4-2S456.0658.01,64.42203dp4-3S465.0757.52203dp4-3S*477.0760.02213dp4-1Ac-3S486.0858.32213dp4-1Ac-3S*496.0464.42204dp4-4S505.0563.9,64.32204dp4-4S*536.0366.2,66.82205dp4-5S545.0366.22205dp4-5S*576.0053.91103dp2-3S685.6165.42314dp6-1Ac-3S705.16aDibutylamine (DBA) adduct of dp2-3S.

It had 34S incorporation and only the isotopic peak m/z 707.16 was labeled in Fig. 4. Open table in a new tab Among these terminal tetrasaccharides, dp4-4S* accounted for the majority and had 34S incorporation (Fig. 4B). To see if dp4-4S* contained a single compound, extracted ion current at m/z 505.05 ± 0.10 was obtained. Two peaks at 63.9 and 64.3 min were found, indicating that dp4-4S* had two structural isomers (Fig. 5A). Only the isomer of the second peak had 34S incorporation. Because the first disaccharide from the NRE of bovine kidney HS could not be labeled by 6-OST-1 (supplemental Fig. 1), the 34S labeling should occur at the 6-O position of the second disaccharide. Considering the rareness and unique positioning of free amino group and 3-O-sulfate on HS (28Xu D. Tiwari V. Xia G. Clement C. Shukla D. Liu J. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Westling C. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49247-49255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the 34S-labeled dp4-4S* isomer was likely to be GlcA-GlcNS6S-UA-GlcNS6S, and the unlabeled dp4-4S* isomer was likely to be GlcA-GlcNS6S-UA2S-GlcNS. The dp4-3S* had a single peak in its extracted ion chromatogram (data not shown) and was likely to have a single structure of GlcA-GlcNS6S-UA-GlcNS. Only trace amounts of dp4-1Ac-3S* and dp4-5S* were detected. Because heparitinase II was known to have overlapping substrate specificity with heparinase, the heparitinase II-digested HS sample was also examined in parallel. Both enzymes were able to release dp2-3S, but otherwise they were different. The major NRE oligosaccharides released by heparitinase II and heparinase were dp2-2S* and dp4-4S*, respectively (Fig. 6). These data suggest that the two enzymes have overlapping but distinct substrate specificities and thus are able to release different NRE oligosaccharides. We have identified and characterized the NRE structures of bovine kidney HS. The first disaccharide of bovine kidney HS was likely to be GlcA-GlcNS6S. The second disaccharide was variable and could be UA-GlcNS6S, IdoA2S-GlcNS, or UA-GlcNS. Because the heparinase that released tetrasaccharides from the NRE has a preference to cleave the glycosidic bond between GlcNS and IdoA2S-GlcNS±6S (30Linker A. Hovingh P. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 127: 75-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the third disaccharide was likely to be IdoA2S-GlcNS±6S (Fig. 7). When Chinese hamster ovary cell HS and porcine intestine HS were examined, the first disaccharides were found to be dp2-2S* too (supplemental Fig. 2, available in the on-line version of this article). Overall, limited sequence variation was observed at the NRE of bovine kidney HS, which suggests that the sequences at the NRE of bovine kidney HS are probably strictly controlled. It is not known if this restricted sequence variation is an overall theme of the whole chain of bovine kidney HS. The sequences of sulfated domains of fibroblast HS were shown to be strictly limited (31Merry C.L. Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18455-18462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The reducing end regions of HS samples from various sources were shown to be unmodified (5Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11208-11215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem.

These findings together suggest that HS could have limited sequences. Great technical progress has been made in HS sequencing and structural determination in recent years (21Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. Science. 1999; 286: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 24Liu J. Shriver Z. Pope R.M. Thorp S.C. Duncan M.B. Copeland R.J. Raska C.S. Yoshida K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 2608-2615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), but HS whole chain sequencing has not been attempted yet. The identification of the NRE of HS may open a door to this avenue. The NRE of an HS is a logical starting point for reading sequences on an HS chain. The NRE oligosaccharides can be easily distinguished from various internal oligosaccharides because of their unique molecular masses. LC/MS also allows us to monitor HS oligosaccharides without radioisotope or chemical labeling. With these advantages, it might be possible for us to sequence the HS whole chain in the future. Current study represents an initial effort on sequencing HS whole chain from its NRE. Interestingly, only GlcA residue was observed at the NRE of bovine kidney HS. A GlcN residue was expected at the NRE of an HS chain (Fig. 1C) if the chain had gone through heparanase digestion in vivo, because heparanase is an endo-glucuronidase that cleaves glucuronidic linkages (20Pikas D.S. Li J.P. Vlodavsky I. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18770-18777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 34Bame K.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 91R-98RCrossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The fact that no GlcN residue was observed the NRE of bovine kidney HS suggests that heparanase activity in bovine kidney was negligible or had different subcellular localizations. Consistently, heparanase was shown to be localized mainly within the lysosome and to be responsible for HS turnover under normal condition (35Zetser A. Levy-Adam F. Kaplan V. Gingis-Velitski S.

Recently, secreted heparanase protein was detected in tumor tissues and was related to the metastatic potential of tumor-derived cells (19Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see if HS from tumor tissues or tumor-derived cells has GlcN at its NRE. In this sense, the NRE of HS could serve as a convenient marker for secreted heparanase activity and, thus, tumor pathology. Based on crystal structure (11Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A.

Our current data prove that a hexasaccharide at the NRE of bovine kidney HS contains 5–7 sulfates. Among them, three are N-sulfates, one or two are 2-O-sulfates, and at least one is a 6-O-sulfate. These sulfates are pivotal and may be sufficient (11Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol.

The fact that bovine kidney HS contains a highly sulfated NRE and a non-sulfated reducing end (9Parthasarathy N. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12749-12755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also suggests a sulfation gradient on HS chain from the reducing end to the NRE. This gradient may facilitate the movement of the binding protein toward the NRE on HS and explains the mechanism of FGF signaling complex formation (13Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Yabe T. Kuberan B. Beeler D.L. Love A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17121-17129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this way, HS can be considered as a regulator of molecular encounter for FGF and its receptor (38Lander A.D. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). One concern about the current study is whether we have covered all possible NRE structures. If some NRE structures were resistant to lyase digestion and could not be released as short oligosaccharides, they could have been missed in our detection. Our current mass spectrometry-coupled high performance liquid chromatography cannot separate large and highly sulfated oligosaccharides such as dp6-8S to dp6-12S, dp8-8S to dp8-16S, dp10-7S to dp10-20S et al. Because these large and highly sulfated oligosaccharides are either unlikely to occur on HS or unlikely to resist to lyase digestion, we think that we have covered most if not all possible NRE structures.

https://openalex.org/W2011773378,"ALMOST all available information about the past thermal behaviour of the oceans has been obtained by studying the oxygen isotope ratios of cores from the deep sea1. One basic limitation of that method is that to derive a palaeotemperature curve from oxygen isotope data one must assume some initial value for the oxygen isotope ratio in the ocean at the time each sample was formed. There has been little independent evidence of past oceanic temperatures to provide a check on these assumed values, and some questions have been raised2 about the significance of the 16O/18O palaeotemperature record. I suggest that the deep water of the Cariaco Trench may provide an estimate of the late glacial surface temperature of the Caribbean Sea which is completely independent of the oxygen isotope method."
