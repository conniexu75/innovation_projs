https://openalex.org/W1981714996,"The inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are common, chronic disorders that cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding. To identify genetic factors that might contribute to these disorders, we performed a genome-wide association study. We found a highly significant association between Crohn's disease and the IL23R gene on chromosome 1p31, which encodes a subunit of the receptor for the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-23. An uncommon coding variant (rs11209026, c.1142G&gt;A, p.Arg381Gln) confers strong protection against Crohn's disease, and additional noncoding IL23R variants are independently associated. Replication studies confirmed IL23R associations in independent cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. These results and previous studies on the proinflammatory role of IL-23 prioritize this signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease."

As distributed systems are assembled from machines belonging to principals with divergent interests, we find that incentives are becoming as important as technical design in achieving dependability. The new field provides valuable insights not just into “security” topics (such as bugs, spam, phishing, and law enforcement strategy) but into more general areas such as the design of peer-to-peer systems, the optimal balance of effort by programmers and testers, why privacy gets eroded, and the politics of digital rights management."

By using digital video microscopy, we quantified the crossover from short-time anisotropic to long-time isotropic diffusion and directly measured probability distributions functions for displacements. We confirmed and interpreted our measurements by using Langevin theory and numerical simulations. Our theory and observations provide insights into fundamental diffusive processes, which are potentially useful for understanding transport in membranes and for understanding the motions of anisotropic macromolecules."

https://openalex.org/W2033964304,"Sorption of actinides, particularly plutonium, onto submicrometer-sized colloids increases their mobility, but these plutonium colloids are difficult to detect in the far-field. We identified actinides on colloids in the groundwater from the Mayak Production Association, Urals, Russia; at the source, the plutonium activity is approximately 1000 becquerels per liter. Plutonium activities are still 0.16 becquerels per liter at a distance of 3 kilometers, where 70 to 90 mole percent of the plutonium is sorbed onto colloids, confirming that colloids are responsible for the long-distance transport of plutonium. Nano-secondary ion mass spectrometry elemental maps reveal that amorphous iron oxide colloids adsorb Pu(IV) hydroxides or carbonates along with uranium carbonates."
https://openalex.org/W2131543005,"We characterized Apis mellifera in both native and introduced ranges using 1136 single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in 341 individuals. Our results indicate that A. mellifera originated in Africa and expanded into Eurasia at least twice, resulting in populations in eastern and western Europe that are geographically close but genetically distant. A third expansion in the New World has involved the near-replacement of previously introduced ""European"" honey bees by descendants of more recently introduced A. m. scutellata (""African"" or ""killer"" bees). Our analyses of spatial transects and temporal series in the New World revealed differential replacement of alleles derived from eastern versus western Europe, with admixture evident in all individuals."

https://openalex.org/W1993721254,"Evidence for superfluidity of ultracold fermionic atom pairs in an optical lattice details that such systems are highly controllable, making them attractive models for studying analogous problems such as high-temperature superconductivity. The study of superfluid fermion pairs in a periodic potential has important ramifications for understanding superconductivity in crystalline materials. By using cold atomic gases, various models of condensed matter can be studied in a highly controllable environment. Weakly repulsive fermions in an optical lattice could undergo d-wave pairing1 at low temperatures, a possible mechanism for high temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides2. The lattice potential could also strongly increase the critical temperature for s-wave superfluidity. Recent experimental advances in bulk atomic gases include the observation of fermion-pair condensates and high-temperature superfluidity3,4,5,6,7,8. Experiments with fermions9,10,11 and bosonic bound pairs12,13 in optical lattices have been reported but have not yet addressed superfluid behaviour. Here we report the observation of distinct interference peaks when a condensate of fermionic atom pairs is released from an optical lattice, implying long-range order (a property of a superfluid). Conceptually, this means that s-wave pairing and coherence of fermion pairs have now been established in a lattice potential, in which the transport of atoms occurs by quantum mechanical tunnelling and not by simple propagation. These observations were made for interactions on both sides of a Feshbach resonance. For larger lattice depths, the coherence was lost in a reversible manner, possibly as a result of a transition from superfluid to insulator. Such strongly interacting fermions in an optical lattice can be used to study a new class of hamiltonians with interband and atom–molecule couplings14."
https://openalex.org/W2072081603,"Large-conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channels (BK Ca ) are dually activated by membrane depolarization and elevation of cytosolic calcium ions (Ca 2+ ). Under normal cellular conditions, BK Ca channel activation requires Ca 2+ concentrations that typically occur in close proximity to Ca 2+ sources. We show that BK Ca channels affinity-purified from rat brain are assembled into macromolecular complexes with the voltage-gated calcium channels Cav1.2 (L-type), Cav2.1 (P/Q-type), and Cav2.2 (N-type). Heterologously expressed BK Ca -Cav complexes reconstitute a functional “Ca 2+ nanodomain” where Ca 2+ influx through the Cav channel activates BK Ca in the physiological voltage range with submillisecond kinetics. Complex formation with distinct Cav channels enables BK Ca -mediated membrane hyperpolarization that controls neuronal firing pattern and release of hormones and transmitters in the central nervous system."

Using the recently sequenced honey bee genome, we present a bioinformatic, molecular, and biochemical characterization of a functional DNA methylation system in an insect. We report on catalytically active orthologs of the vertebrate DNA methyltransferases Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a and b, two isoforms that contain a methyl-DNA binding domain, genomic 5-methyl-deoxycytosine, and CpG-methylated genes. The honey bee provides an opportunity to study the roles of methylation in social contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2027459589,"Flux of dimethylsulfide (DMS) from ocean surface waters is the predominant natural source of sulfur to the atmosphere and influences climate by aerosol formation. Marine bacterioplankton regulate sulfur flux by converting the precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) either to DMS or to sulfur compounds that are not climatically active. Through the discovery of a glycine cleavage T-family protein with DMSP methyltransferase activity, marine bacterioplankton in the Roseobacter and SAR11 taxa were identified as primary mediators of DMSP demethylation to methylmercaptopropionate. One-third of surface ocean bacteria harbor a DMSP demethylase homolog and thereby route a substantial fraction of global marine primary production away from DMS formation and into the marine microbial food web."
https://openalex.org/W1988331575,"Neuropeptides, critical brain peptides that modulate animal behavior by affecting the activity of almost every neuronal circuit, are inherently difficult to predict directly from a nascent genome sequence because of extensive posttranslational processing. The combination of bioinformatics and proteomics allows unprecedented neuropeptide discovery from an unannotated genome. Within the Apis mellifera genome, we have inferred more than 200 neuropeptides and have confirmed the sequences of 100 peptides. This study lays the groundwork for future molecular studies of Apis neuropeptides with the identification of 36 genes, 33 of which were previously unreported."
https://openalex.org/W2069701135,"The detection of fast variations of the tera–electron volt (TeV) (10 12 eV) γ-ray flux, on time scales of days, from the nearby radio galaxy M87 is reported. These variations are about 10 times as fast as those observed in any other wave band and imply a very compact emission region with a dimension similar to the Schwarzschild radius of the central black hole. We thus can exclude several other sites and processes of the γ-ray production. The observations confirm that TeV γ rays are emitted by extragalactic sources other than blazars, where jets are not relativistically beamed toward the observer."

Despite widespread interest in Dictyostelium discoideum as a model system, almost no molecular data exist from the rest of the group. We constructed the first molecular phylogeny of the Dictyostelia with parallel small subunit ribosomal RNA and a-tubulin data sets, and we found that dictyostelid taxonomy requires complete revision. A mapping of characters onto the phylogeny shows that the dominant trend in dictyostelid evolution is increased size and cell type specialization of fruiting structures, with some complex morphologies evolving several times independently. Thus, the latter may be controlled by only a few genes, making their underlying mechanisms relatively easy to unravel."

https://openalex.org/W2056071095,"Low-mass stars, approximately 1 to 2 solar masses, near the Main Sequence are efficient at producing the helium isotope 3He, which they mix into the convective envelope on the giant branch and should distribute into the Galaxy by way of envelope loss. This process is so efficient that it is difficult to reconcile the low observed cosmic abundance of 3He with the predictions of both stellar and Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Here we find, by modeling a red giant with a fully three-dimensional hydrodynamic code and a full nucleosynthetic network, that mixing arises in the supposedly stable and radiative zone between the hydrogen-burning shell and the base of the convective envelope. This mixing is due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability within a zone just above the hydrogen-burning shell, where a nuclear reaction lowers the mean molecular weight slightly. Thus, we are able to remove the threat that 3He production in low-mass stars poses to the Big Bang nucleosynthesis of 3He."

Incubations of natural communities and axenic cultures with radio-labeled DMSP showed that dominant phytoplankton groups of the ocean, the unicellular cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus and diatoms, as well as heterotrophic bacteria take up and assimilate DMSP sulfur, thus diverting a proportion of plankton-produced organic sulfur from emission into the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2014679297,We present direct evidence for complex p-wave order parameter symmetry and the presence of dynamical chiral order parameter domains of the form p x ± ip y in the ruthenate superconductor Sr 2 RuO 4 . The domain structure creates differences in the magnetic field modulation of the critical current of Josephson junctions fabricated on orthogonal faces of Sr 2 RuO 4 single crystals. Transitions between the chiral states of a domain or the motion of domain walls separating them generates telegraph noise in the critical current as a function of magnetic field or time and is responsible for hysteresis observed in field sweeps of the critical current. The presence of such domains confirms the p-wave triplet spin and complex (broken time-reversal symmetry) nature of the superconducting pairing state in Sr 2 RuO 4 .
https://openalex.org/W2147417135,"Methoxy(polyethylene glycol), mPEG, -grafted liposomes are known to exhibit prolonged circulation time in the blood, but their infusion into a substantial percentage of human subjects triggers immediate non-IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. These reactions are strongly believed to arise from anaphylatoxin production through complement activation. Despite the general view that vesicle surface camouflaging with mPEG should dramatically suppress complement activation, here we show that bilayer enrichment of noncomplement activating liposomes [dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) vesicles] with phospholipid-mPEG conjugate induces complement activation resulting in vesicle recognition by macrophage complement receptors. The extent of vesicle uptake, however, is dependent on surface mPEG density. We have delineated the likely structural features of phospholipid-mPEG conjugate responsible for PEGylated liposome-induced complement activation in normal as well as C1q-deficient human sera, using DPPC vesicles bearing the classical as well as newly synthesized lipid-mPEG conjugates. With PEGylated DPPC vesicles, the net anionic charge on the phosphate moiety of phospholipid-mPEG conjugate played a key role in activation of both classical and alternative pathways of complement and anaphylatoxin production (reflected in significant rises in SC5b-9, C4d, and C3a-desarg levels in normal human sera as well as SC5b-9 in EGTA-chelated/Mg2+ supplemented serum), since methylation of the phosphate oxygen of phospholipid-mPEG conjugate, and hence the removal of the negative charge, totally prevented complement activation. To further corroborate on the role of the negative charge in complement activation, vesicles bearing anionic phospholipid-mPEG conjugates, but not the methylated phospholipid-mPEG, were shown to significantly decrease serum hemolytic activity and increase plasma thromboxane B2 levels in rats. In contrast to liposomes, phospholipid-mPEG micelles had no effect on complement activation, thus suggesting a possible role for vesicular zwitterionic phospholipid head-groups as an additional factor contributing to PEGylated liposome-mediated complement activation. Our findings provide a rational conceptual basis for development of safer vesicles for site-specific drug delivery and controlled release at pathological sites."

https://openalex.org/W2155916115,"Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes the conversion of heme to biliverdin with the release of iron and carbon monoxide. HO-1 is highly inducible by a large number of physical and chemical factors. CoPP is known to be a potent and effective inducer of HO-1 activity in many tissues. Here we report that CoPP up-regulates HO-1 via Bach1 and Nrf2 in human liver cells. CoPP did not influence hepatic Bach1 or Nrf2 mRNA levels, but markedly reduced Bach1 protein levels by increasing degradation of Bach1 protein (t(1/2) from 19 h to 2.8 h), and increased Nrf2 by decreasing degradation of Nrf2 protein (t(1/2) from 2.5 h to 9 h). Silencing Bach1 by Bach1-siRNA significantly increased levels of HO-1 mRNA and protein, and addition of CoPP up-regulated HO-1 mRNA and protein further. However, silencing Nrf2 mRNA by Nrf2-siRNA did not significantly change baseline HO-1 mRNA or protein levels, but significantly decreased 5-10 microM CoPP-mediated up-regulation of HO-1 mRNA levels compared with CoPP alone. Transfection with equal amounts of non-Bach1 or non-Nrf2 related control siRNA did not reduce Bach1 or Nrf2 mRNA or protein, confirming the specificity of Bach1- and Nrf2-siRNA in Huh-7 cells. We conclude that the pathway of CoPP-mediated induction of HO-1 involves the repression of Bach1 and up-regulation of the Nrf2 protein by post-transcriptional site(s) of action. Because CoPP, unlike heme, is neither a prooxidant nor a substrate for HO-1, it might be considered as a potential therapeutic agent in situations where up-regulation of HO-1 is desired."

https://openalex.org/W2010058088,"Computational studies aimed at extracting interface mobilities require driving forces orders of magnitude higher than those occurring experimentally. We present a computational methodology that extracts the absolute interface mobility in the zero driving force limit by monitoring the one-dimensional random walk of the mean interface position along the interface normal. The method exploits a fluctuation-dissipation relation similar to the Stokes-Einstein relation, which relates the diffusion coefficient of this Brownian-like random walk to the interface mobility. Atomic-scale simulations of grain boundaries in model crystalline systems validate the theoretical predictions and highlight the profound effect of impurities. The generality of this technique, combined with its inherent spatiotemporal efficiency, should allow computational studies to effectively complement experiments in understanding interface kinetics in diverse material systems."

https://openalex.org/W2091723502,"A number of hypotheses regarding how anti-Abeta antibodies alter amyloid deposition have been postulated, yet there is no consensus as to how Abeta immunotherapy works. We have examined the in vivo binding properties, pharmacokinetics, brain penetrance, and alterations in Abeta levels after a single peripheral dose of anti-Abeta antibodies to both wild-type (WT) and young non-Abeta depositing APP and BRI-Abeta42 mice. The rapid rise in plasma Abeta observed after antibody (Ab) administration is attributable to prolongation of the half-life of Abeta bound to the Ab. Only a miniscule fraction of Ab enters the brain, and despite dramatic increases in plasma Abeta, we find no evidence that total brain Abeta levels are significantly altered. Surprisingly, cerebral spinal fluid Abeta levels transiently rise, and when Ab:Abeta complex is directly injected into the lateral ventricles of mice, it is rapidly cleared from the brain into the plasma where it remains stable. When viewed in context of daily turnover of Abeta, these data provide a framework to evaluate proposed mechanisms of Abeta attenuation mediated by peripheral administration of an anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody (mAb) effective in passive immunization paradigm. Such quantitative data suggest that the mAbs are either indirectly enhancing clearance of Abeta or targeting a low abundance aggregation intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2016401677,"Many inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family proteins inhibit apoptosis. IAPs contain N-terminal baculovirus IAP repeat domains and a C-terminal RING ubiquitin ligase domain. Drosophila IAP DIAP1 is essential for the survival of many cells, protecting them from apoptosis by inhibiting active caspases. Apoptosis initiates when proteins such as Reaper, Hid, and Grim bind a surface groove in DIAP1 baculovirus IAP repeat domains via an N-terminal IAP-binding motif. This evolutionarily conserved interaction disrupts DIAP1-caspase interactions, unleashing apoptosis-inducing caspase activity. A second Drosophila IAP, DIAP2, also binds Rpr and Hid and inhibits apoptosis in multiple contexts when overexpressed. However, due to a lack of mutants, little is known about the normal functions of DIAP2. We report the generation of diap2 null mutants. These flies are viable and show no defects in developmental or stress-induced apoptosis. Instead, DIAP2 is required for the innate immune response to Gram-negative bacterial infection. DIAP2 promotes cytoplasmic cleavage and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB homolog Relish, and this requires the DIAP2 RING domain. Increasing the genetic dose of diap2 results in an increased immune response, whereas expression of Rpr or Hid results in down-regulation of DIAP2 protein levels. Together these observations suggest that DIAP2 can regulate immune signaling in a dose-dependent manner, and this can be regulated by IBM-containing proteins.

IAPs also contain a C-terminal RING E3 ubiquitin ligase domain that can target bound proteins, as well as the IAP itself, for ubiquitination and in some cases degradation (1Vaux D.L. Silke J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The Drosophila genome encodes two BIR and RING domain-containing IAP family members, DIAP1 and DIAP2, and ectopic expression of either protein inhibits apoptosis (2Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M.

Apoptosis in the fly can be induced by expression of proteins such as Reaper, Hid, Grim, Sickle, and Jafrac2 (the RHG proteins).

Questions regarding the role of DIAP2 as a cell death and/or immune regulator can best be approached through the characterization of deletion mutant animals. In contrast with previous work, we show here that diap2 mutants are viable and do not show increased sensitivity to a number of different cell death stimuli. Instead, DIAP2 is required for immune deficiency signaling in response to Gram-negative bacteria infection. DIAP2 promotes but is not absolutely essential for Relish cleavage. Nonetheless, loss of DIAP2 is associated with a profound defect in Relish nuclear translocation and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression. Together, these results suggest that DIAP2 regulates Relish function at several points. Interestingly, DIAP2 levels could be dramatically reduced in cells expressing the apoptosis inducers Rpr or Hid, suggesting an hypothesis in which DIAP2 acts as a point of convergence between immune and apoptotic signaling. Binding of death-inducing RHG proteins may act as a safety device to prevent unwanted chronic inflammation in the context to which massive cell death occurs during development or in response to environmental stress. Other IBM proteins may regulate DIAP2-dependent immune responses in other contexts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFly Stocks—All transformants were generated using standard techniques. w1118 flies were used as wild type. The P element line used to carry out imprecise excisions in the diap2 region, G2534, was obtained from Genexel, Korea. Excisions were carried out using standard techniques. 300 independent excision lines were characterized at the diap2 locus by genomic PCR using the primers indicated in Fig. 1. PCR fragments amplified from diap2 mutant genomic DNA were fully sequenced to confirm deletion boundaries. Wild type rescue (diap2E151; diap27.4Wt) and RING mutant rescue (diap2E151;diap27.4C472Y) flies were generated by introducing a 7.4-kb genomic fragment that contains the DIAP2 open reading frame and nearby sequences into pCaSpeR4. Transformants containing these constructs were introduced into the diap2E151 genetic background. For the wild type 7.4-kb genomic fragment, three small fragments (3.2, 1.2, and 3 kb) were amplified from the BAC clone covering the DIAP2 genomic region and ligated into pCaSpeR4 with NotI, XbaI, HpaI, and XhoI, respectively. Primers 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCAATAACCGAATCGGAAAACG-3′ and 5′-CGCTCTAGATTGTAAGAGGGAG-3′ were used to generate the 3.2-kb fragment, and primers 5′-CGCTCTAGATAAGCAACGCTCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGTTAACCCGACAGCCACCTGCAATC-3′ were used to generate the 1.2-kb fragment, and primers 5′-CGCGTTAACAGGAAGTTAGCTAC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGGGGCTCGAATTTGATTAGC-3′ were used to generate the 3-kb fragment. For the 7.4-kb genomic fragment with the RING-mutation, changing Cys → Tyr at amino acid 472, alternative primer pairs (5′-CGCTCTAGATAAGCAACGCTCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGTTAACCCGACAGCCACCTACAATC-3′) were used for the synthesis of the 1.2-kb fragment.

Chen and B. Hay, manuscript in preparation. Fly Immune Challenge—All Drosophila stocks were raised at 25 °C. One- to 3-day-old adult male flies were pricked with a fine glass needle dipped in an overnight live culture of Enterobacter cloacae or Staphylococcus aureus, resuspended at 20× concentration in sterile S2 cell medium.Irradiation-induced Stress—Forty wild type or diap2E151 3rd instar larvae were placed in 1.5-ml tubes and X-irradiated with 2000 or 4000 rads. Subsequently, they were moved to fresh vials and scored for hatching efficiency. Each experiment was repeated three times. Error bars on figures indicate the standard deviation.Oxidative Stress—One- to 3-day-old adult males were put in vials (20 flies to a vial, total five vials), with eight filter paper disks soaked with 500 μl of 5% sucrose and 20 mm methyl viologen (paraquat). Each experiment was repeated twice.Salt Stress Tolerance—Solid medium that contained 2.5% sucrose, 1% agar, 0.15% methyl paraben, 0.003% methylene blue, and different concentrations of NaCl (0.4 or 0.8 m) was prepared in vials. Fifty young adult males of each genotype were introduced into these vials (25 flies per vial) and scored for survival over the next 4 days. Each experiment was repeated three times.Heat Shock Induction—Wild type and diap2E151 mutant 3rd instar larvae carrying an hs-diap1-dsRNA construct were transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and subjected to 10, 20, or 30 min of heat treatment in a 37 °C water bath. Each experiment was repeated in triplicate. For the induction of RelishRHD, adult wild type or diap2 mutant male flies carrying hs-RelishRHD were subjected to a 30-min heat shock at 37 °C and allowed to recover for 6 h at 25 °C before total RNA was isolated to quantify levels of antimicrobial peptide gene induction.RNA Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from whole flies using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For real time PCR analysis, cDNAs were synthesized with the Superscript III reverse transcriptase system (Invitrogen). An amount of cDNA equivalent to 0.3 μg of total RNA was subjected to 40 cycles of PCR amplification for 15 s at 95 °C and a 1-min incubation at 60 °C. The output was monitored using SYBR Green core reagents and the ABI Prism 7900 system (Applied Biosystems). All results were normalized to the levels of rp49 mRNA. Individual primer sequences are available upon request.Protein Analysis—For immunoblot analysis, 20 adult flies were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and 1× protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE.

Caspase activity was measured at 27 °C using a fluorometric plate reader (Fmax; Molecular Devices) in the kinetic mode with excitation and emission wavelengths of 405 and 510 nm, respectively. Assays were performed in triplicate.Gene Switch System—Flies carrying the adult fat body gene switch driver S106 in different genetic backgrounds were placed in empty vials with eight 3MM filter paper disks overnight (20 h) (31Roman G. Endo K. Zong L. Davis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12602-12607Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To induce gene expression, disks were wetted with 800 μl of 500 μm RU486 (Sigma) in 2% sucrose solution. Following immune challenge, flies were allowed to recover in normal fly food vials for 4 h prior to RNA preparation.RESULTSGeneration of diap2 Deletion mutants; diap2 Is Dispensable for Development—To examine DIAP2 (CG8293) functions in vivo, we generated two diap2 deletion mutants, diap2E151 and diap2E119, via imprecise excision of the P element G2534, which is located 100 bp upstream of the diap2 start codon (Fig. 1a). diap2E119 deletes ∼840 bp and diap2E151 ∼1,460 bp downstream of the original P element insertion site, without affecting neighboring genes (Fig. 1b). RT-PCR and Western blot analysis failed to detect full-length diap2 mRNA or protein in either mutant (Fig. 1, c and d, and Fig. 5a). Truncated diap2 transcripts are detectable in diap2E151 and diap2E119 animals. However, these transcripts are unlikely to generate functional proteins because multiple in-frame start and stop codons precede the remaining C-terminal diap2 coding sequences. Together these results suggest that diap2E151 and diap2E119 represent null alleles. Introduction of a 7.4-kb genomic fragment encoding wild type diap2 (diap27.4Wt) or a point mutant of diap2 with a mutation in the RING domain (diap27.4C472Y) into the diap2E151 mutant background resulted in expression of a full-length diap2 transcript (Fig. 1, a and c) and protein (Fig. 5a). In contrast to mutations in diap1 (alleles of th), which are lethal early in embryogenesis, animals homozygous for diap2E151 and diap2E119 are viable, healthy, and fertile. Therefore, diap2 is dispensable for most, if not all, developmental cell death.FIGURE 5DIAP2 promotes cleavage and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB transcription factor Relish in response to immune challenge. a, immunoblots of protein extracts (protein amount equivalent to three adult male flies) from untreated (-) and immune-challenged (heat-killed Escherichia coli) (+) flies of various genotypes, probed sequentially with anti-Relish C-terminal, anti-DIAP2, and anti-tubulin antibodies. The left and right panels are from different gels but are from the same experiment. In wild type and diap2E151;diap27.4Wt flies, a 49-kDa Relish C-terminal fragment is present 1 h after immune challenge as a result of endoproteolytic processing. Cleavage of Relish is not observed in dredd, imd, and diap2E151 flies carrying diap27.4C472Y. As with wild type flies, diap2E151 flies show low levels of the C-terminal Relish cleavage product prior to immune challenge. However, in contrast to wild type flies, these levels increase modestly 1 h post-challenge. b, immunostaining of endogenous Relish in the 3rd instar larval fat bodies of various genotypes.

Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). However, removing diap2 had little if any effect on RHG overexpression-induced apoptosis in the eye (Fig. 2a). Expression of diap2 also failed to suppress death induced by expression of Dronc, Drice, Strica (Fig. 2b), and Dcp-1 (data not shown), indicating that DIAP2 does not inhibit the activity of multiple caspases, despite its structural and sequence similarity to DIAP1. This failure is particularly noteworthy in the case of Dronc and Drice, which are the central mediators of RHG-dependent cell death in the fly eye (32Xu X. Li Y. Arcaro M. Lackey M. Bergmann A.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These observations call into question the idea that DIAP2 normally functions as a cell death inhibitor. To explore this issue further, we exposed animals lacking DIAP2 to several stresses that lead ultimately to cell and organismal death as follows: X-irradiation, the free radical generator paraquat; and high salt, an activator of the p38 MAPK pathway (24Xu P. Vernooy S.Y. Guo M. Hay B.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 790-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 37Clark I.E. Dodson M.D. Jiang C. Cao J.H. Huh J.R. Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Hay B.A. Guo M. Nature. 2006; 441: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). If the physiological role of diap2 is to prevent cell death, removal of diap2 should render animals more sensitive to these stresses. However, compared with wild type or diap2E151 flies carrying the diap27.4Wt rescue construct, diap2E151 mutant flies did not exhibit increased sensitivity to any of these stresses (Fig. 2, c-e). Finally, we tested the hypothesis that diap2 functions as a minor apoptosis inhibitor whose activity is only required in the absence of a major cell death inhibitor such as diap1. We transiently knocked down diap1 levels in the third instar larvae using RNAi, in the presence or absence of diap2, and scored for larval survival (see “Materials and Methods”). Decreasing diap1 in the presence of diap2 resulted in almost complete lethality (<10% survival), whereas in the absence of diap2 many more larvae survived (>35% survival) (supplemental Fig. 2a). Therefore, although our results do not exclude the possibility that diap2 plays an anti-apoptotic role in some context, they strongly suggest that diap2 normally plays little, if any role, in the regulation of the canonical caspasedependent apoptosis pathway.FIGURE 2DIAP2 fails to inhibit multiple caspases and does not act as a significant inhibitor of death induced by expression of Rpr-, Hid-, X-irradiation, the free radical generator paraquot, or salt stress. a, removal of diap2 fails to enhance cell death induced by Rpr or Hid overexpression.

https://openalex.org/W2012103655,"Proper histone levels are critical for transcription, chromosome segregation, and other chromatin-mediated processes(1-7). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the histones H2A and H2B are encoded by two gene pairs, named HTA1-HTB1 and HTA2-HTB2 (ref. 8). Previous studies have demonstrated that when HTA2-HTB2 is deleted, HTA1-HTB1 dosage compensates at the transcriptional level(4,9). Here we show that a different mechanism of dosage compensation, at the level of gene copy number, can occur when HTA1-HTB1 is deleted. In this case, HTA2-HTB2 amplifies via creation of a new, small, circular chromosome. This duplication, which contains 39 kb of chromosome II, includes HTA2-HTB2, the histone H3-H4 locus HHT1-HHF1, a centromere and origins of replication. Formation of the new chromosome occurs by recombination between two Ty1 retrotransposon elements that flank this region. Following meiosis, recombination between these two particular Ty1 elements occurs at a greatly elevated level in hta1-htb1Delta mutants, suggesting that a decreased level of histones H2A and H2B specifically stimulates this amplification of histone genes. Our results demonstrate another mechanism by which histone gene dosage is controlled to maintain genomic integrity."

Five homologues to the Drosophila Toll (Toll1) receptor (Toll1A, Toll1B, Toll5A, Toll5B, and Toll4) and three homologues to the Drosophila cytokine Spätzle (Spz1A, 1B, and 1C) were identified from genomic and cDNA sequence data bases.

Drosophila MyD88 (DmMyD88) connects Toll and kinase pelle, a homologue of mammalian IL-1R-associated kinases. Another adaptor-like molecule, Tube, interacts with both DmMyD88 and pelle. The immune signaling by Toll receptor activates two closely related NF-κB proteins, Dif (Dorsal-related immunity factor) in adults and Dorsal and/or Dif in larvae. Cactus, a Drosophila member of the IκB family of NF-κB inhibitors, retains Dif and/or Dorsal in inactive forms in the cytoplasm. Toll signaling activates the phosphorylation of Cactus, resulting in ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of Cactus. Dif and/or Dorsal then translocate to the nucleus, where they activate the transcription of target genes.Both Drosophila Toll and mammalian Toll-like receptors are activated upon microbial challenge. Toll-like receptors have been shown to be directly stimulated by microbial molecules, whereas the activation of Drosophila Toll requires a cytokine Spätzle (Spz/Spz1), a member of the cysteine knot family of growth factors. Proteolytic processing of the secreted polypeptide Spz is necessary to activate Drosophila Toll immune pathway (10Mizuguchi K. Parker J.S. Blundell T.L. Gay N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently, the direct interaction between Toll and Spz has been described (11Weber A.N. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J.A. Lelievre E. Gascan H. Ray K.P. Morse M.A. Imler J.L. Gay N.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 12Hu X. Yagi Y. Tanji T. Zhou S. Ip Y.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9369-9374Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), showing that the signal-dependent processing of the extracellular protein Spz and then the binding of the cleaved form (C-106) to Toll receptor are required for the activation of this immune pathway. There are five additional Spz homologues (Spz2-6) in the Drosophila genome; all contain a neutrophin-like cysteine knot domain (13Parker J.S. Mizuguchi K. Gay N.J. Proteins. 2001; 45: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). They may encode ligands for other members of the Drosophila Toll family, but their involvement in development or immunity has not yet been characterized. In Anopheles gambiae, six Spz homologues (Spz1-6) as a 1:1 orthologue of Drosophila Spz have been identified from the published genomic sequence (14Christophides G.K. Zdobnov E. Barillas-Mury C. Birney E. Blandin S. Blass C. Brey P.T. Collins F.H. Danielli A. Dimopoulos G. Hetru C. Hoa N.T. Hoffmann J.A. Kanzok S.M. Letunic I. Levashina E.A. Loukeris T.G. Lycett G. Meister S. Michel K.

Science. 2002; 298: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar).In Drosophila, the Toll family of receptors comprises nine members, Toll and Toll-2 to Toll-9 (15Tauszig S. Jouanguy E. Hoffmann J.A. Imler J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10520-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Although the dual function of Toll in immunity and development is apparent, the functions of Toll-2 to Toll-9 are currently under investigation. Toll-5 and -9 have been shown to activate the Drosomycin promoter in tissue culture cells (15Tauszig S. Jouanguy E. Hoffmann J.A. Imler J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10520-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 16Luo C. Shen B. Manley J.L. Zheng L. Insect Mol. Biol. 2001; 10: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Ooi J.Y. Yagi Y. Hu X. Ip Y.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, in vivo significance of these Toll receptors in immunity is still unclear. The other Toll receptors neither activate transcription of the genes encoding antimicrobial peptides nor interact with DmMyd88 (18Tauszig-Delamasure S. Bilak H. Capovilla M. Hoffmann J.A. Imler J.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Most Tolls are highly expressed during embryogenesis and metamorphosis (15Tauszig S. Jouanguy E. Hoffmann J.A. Imler J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10520-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).In mosquitoes, the expansion of Toll (Toll1) has been observed. Four genes from An. Gambiae, TOLL 1A, 1B, 5A, and 5B, form an orthologue group with the fruit fly Toll and Toll-5 (Tehao) (14Christophides G.K. Zdobnov E. Barillas-Mury C. Birney E. Blandin S. Blass C. Brey P.T.

Science. 2002; 298: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). In Aedes aegypti, three homologous genes of Drosophila Toll (Toll-1) have been identified and named as AeToll1A, AeToll1B, and AeToll5 (19Luna C. Wang X. Huang Y. Zhang J. Zheng L. Insect Biochem.

In cell culture studies, both Toll1A and Toll5A were shown to activate the expression of a firefly luciferase gene under the control of Drosomycin promoter (20Luna C. Hoa N.T. Zhang J. Kanzok S.M.

Recently, by way of transgenic and RNA interference studies of REL1 (a homologue of Drosophila Dorsal), we characterized the mosquito Toll immune pathway as the antifungal immune response and the specific activation of Aedes Serpin-27A (Spn27A) (21Shin S.W.

We used these tools to define which specific Toll receptor and cytokine Spz were directly involved in the Toll immune pathway. Here, we present evidence that in Ae. aegypti Spz1C and Toll5A function as major mediators of this pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODSExperimental Insects—UGAL/Rockefeller, the wild-type strain of the Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, and two strains of transgenic mosquitoes, ΔREL1 (gain-of-function of REL1) and iREL1 (loss-of-function of REL1) (22Bian G. Shin S.W. Cheon H.-M. Kokoza V. Raikhel A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13568-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), were maintained in laboratory culture as described elsewhere (25Hays A.R. Raikhel A.S. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1990; 199: 114-121Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Adult mosquitoes were provided with water and a 10% sucrose solution. All dissections were performed in Aedes physiological saline (26Hagedorn H.H. Turner S. Hagedorn E.A. Pontecorvo D. Greenbaum P. Pfeiffer D. Wheelock G. Flanagan T.R. J. Insect Physiol. 1977; 23: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Data Base Searches and Phylogeny—The cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequences were obtained by the TBLASTN search against nucleotide sequences published in the TIGR Ae. aegypti gene index (The TIGR Gene Index Databases, www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi, The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD). Ae. aegypti genomic sequence data base (7.63X sequence assembly by Aedes aegypti Sequencing Project, Broad Institute of Harvard & MIT (www.broad.mit.edu) and The Institute for Genomic Research (www.tigr.org)) deposited in the Broad Institute was queried by TBLASTN with Drosophila Toll and Spz. All hits were examined manually for the conservation of common domain structures of Toll receptor and Spz families. The TIR domains of various Toll receptors and neutrophin-like cysteine knot domains of Spzs were aligned using ClustalW, manually adjusted, and then subjected to phylogenetic analysis.Septic Injury, Natural Infection, and Survival Experiments— Septic injuries were performed by pricking mosquitoes in the rear part of the abdomen with an acupuncture needle (0.20 × 25 mm) dipped into bacterial culture (stationary phase of bacteria in Luria Bertani broth; OD ∼2.0) or a fungal spore suspension (∼5 × 107 viable spores/ml) of B. bassiana strain GHA. The viable spore number was calculated by spreading the suspension onto Sabouraud dextrose-agar plates. Survival experiments were carried out under the same conditions. Following each dsRNA injection after 4-5 days recovery, groups of 20-25 Ae. aegypti female mosquitoes were challenged by a spore suspension. To test survival rate after natural infection, anesthetized mosquitoes were manually shaken for 10 s in a Petri dish containing B. bassiana spores.Infections and Northern Hybridization Analysis—For the pathogen-specific study, 2- or 3-day-old adult Ae. aegypti females were injected with a stationary phase culture of Enterobacter cloacae, Micrococcus cloacae, or a spore suspension of B. bassiana. For the stage-specific study, adult males and females, fourth instar larvae, and pupae were collected with and/or without the challenge of fungal spores. For the tissue-specific study, fat bodies, ovaries, and midguts were dissected from naïve mosquitoes and mosquitoes 1 day after fungal challenge. The Vg-ΔREL1-A transgenic and wild-type UGAL mosquitoes were blood fed at 2-3 days after emerging and collected at 24 h post-blood meal. The Vg-iREL1 transgenic and wild-type UGAL mosquitoes were forced to lay eggs at 3 days after the second blood feeding and then challenged with B. bassiana spores the next day. The mosquitoes were collected 1 day after challenge. For RNA interference experiments, the mosquitoes 5 days after RNA interference treatment were challenged with fungal spore and then collected 2 days later. Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Samples of 5 μg of total RNA were separated on a formaldehyde gel, blotted, and hybridized with the corresponding DNA probe.Reverse Transcription and PCR—Reverse transcription was carried out using an Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen) in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing oligo(dT) primers and 2 μg of total RNA at 37°C for 1 h. PCR was performed using Platinum High Fidelity Supermix (Invitrogen). The protocol for amplifying the cDNA product of Toll5B was 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and then 50 °C for 30 s, followed by 68 °C for 45 s.Synthesis and Microinjection of dsRNA—Templates for the synthesis of dsRNA were generated using RT-PCR and incorporating a T7 phage promoter sequence into both sense and antisense primers. RT-PCR was performed using the Titan one-step RT-PCR kit (Roche Applied Science) with samples of 0.2 μg of total RNA as templates to generate a 400- to 600-bp gene-specific cDNA fragment. Tubes containing RNA and RNase inhibitor (1 u/μl; Roche Applied Science) were incubated for 30 min at 50 °C for the RT reaction. Amplification conditions involved rapid heating to 94 °C for 2 min followed by 30 to 35 cycles of 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and 94 °C for 30 s. PCR primers as follows (each primer contains T7 sequence at 5′-AATACGACTCACTATAGGG): T7-Toll1A-Forward, 5′-T7-AATAATGCGATCGTTGAACTGC-3′, T7-Toll1A-Reverse, 5′-T7-CATCGTACAGCTTGTCCTTGTCC-3′; T7-Toll1B-Forword, 5′-T7-TCTCATCAGGATTCCACAAC-3′, T7-Toll1B-Reverse, 5′-T7-CGGTTGAAATTCCGACGAAG-3′; T7-Toll5A-Forward, 5′-T7-ACCAACTACAAACCAAAGATC-3′, T7-Toll5A-Reverse, 5′-T7-TGGCATCTTACTGCGGACATG-3′; T7-Toll5B-Forward, 5′-T7-CTGATCACTTTCGTCGCGTATGG-3′, T7-Toll5B-Reverse, 5′-T7-ATGTGGCATGGCATATCGTAGC-3′; T7-Toll4-Forward, 5′-T7-CTGACAGAATTCGAGGAGTCC-3′, T7-Toll4-Reverse, 5′-T7-CATCGCGTACACCAGCTTCTGCC-3′; T7-Spz1A-Forword, 5′-T7-TTTATACCTACTAATGGCAG-3′, T7-Spz1A-Reverse, 5′-T7-TGTGCACTCGGTCCTGTC-3′; T7-Spz1B-Forward, 5′-T7-CCTTTGATAAGGCAGAGAGAC-3′, T7-Spz1B-Reverse, 5′-T7-CAAAGAAACTCGTCGTCTGATG-3′; T7-Spz1C-Forword, 5′-T7-AACTCTTACTTATGTGTTTCC-3′, T7-Spz1C-Reverse, 5′-T7-CACATTTACAGCAGCTTGGAC-3′.Synthesis of dsRNA was accomplished by simultaneous transcription of both strands of template DNA using the MEGAscript kit (Ambion). The plasmid LITMUS 28iMal containing a nonfunctional portion of the Escherichia coli malE gene that encodes maltose-binding protein was used to generate control dsRNA. After RNA synthesis, the samples were treated by means of phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The dsRNA was then suspended in distilled water with a final concentration of 5 μg/μl. The formation of dsRNA was confirmed by running 0.2 μl of these reactions on a 1.0% agarose gel in TBE (90 mm Tris borate/2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). A Picospritzer II (General Valve, Fairfield, NJ) was used to introduce 200 nl of dsRNA into the thorax of CO2-anesthetized mosquito females at 1-2 days post-eclosion.RESULTSDiversity Expansion of Toll and Spz in Ae. aegypti—Four genes from An. gambiae (TOLL 1A, 1B, 5A and 5B) and three from Ae. aegypti (Toll1A, Toll1B, and Toll5A) have been suggested to form an orthologue group with the fruit fly Toll (Toll-1) and Toll-5 (Tehao) (14Christophides G.K.

An additional search using TBLASTN against the Ae. aegypti genome sequence revealed two more genomic loci encoding possible orthologues of Drosophila Toll and Toll-5. The open reading frames from these two loci were predicted using FGENESH+ (27Brudno M. Poliakov A. Salamov A. Cooper G.M. Sidow A. Rubin E.M. Solovyev V. Batzoglou S. Dubchak I. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (sun1.softberry.com) by comparing ∼100 kb of the flanking genomic DNA sequence of a possible Ae. aegypti orthologue region with the amino acid sequence of Drosophila Toll, and these new Toll homologues were named Toll5B and Toll4, respectively, based on the phylogenetic relationship with Drosophila and Anopheles Tolls (Fig. 1A). The partial cDNA sequences of these Toll genes have been deposited in the GenBank™ data base (accession number DQ437573 for Toll5B, DQ437574 for Toll4). Toll-related receptors are characterized by TIR, a 150-amino acid intra-cytoplasmic domain, which has been found in members of the interleukin-1 receptor family and plant disease resistance genes (28Imler J.-L. Zheng L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the presence of C-terminal extension distinguished the Toll1 group (Drosophila Toll, Anopheles TOLL1A and TOLL1B, Aedes Toll1A and Toll1B) from Toll5 group (Drosophila Toll-5, Anopheles TOLL5A and TOLL5B, Aedes Toll5A) (19Luna C. Wang X. Huang Y. Zhang J. Zheng L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Michel K. Budd A. Pinto S. Gibson T.J. Kafatos F.C. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), our phylogenetic studies with whole published amino acid sequences (data not shown) or TIR domains (Fig. 1A) of Toll receptors indicated that these five Aedes Tolls (Toll1A, Toll1B, Toll5A, Toll5B, and Toll4) and four Anopheles Tolls (TOLL1A, TOLL1B, TOLL5A, and TOLL5B) formed a phylogenetic cluster with Drosophila Toll and Toll-5 (Fig. 1A), which are known to function in Drosophila immunity. Interestingly, eight of the nine mosquito Tolls (all except Aedes Toll4) were grouped together with 90% bootstrap values, suggesting that these mosquito Toll proteins have evolved from a common ancestor.The TBLASTN search against nucleotide sequences published in the TIGR Ae. aegypti gene index indicated four sequences (TC36481, TC47492, TC39244, and TC47353) encoding each deduced protein similar to Drosophila Spz. In addition, we identified four more genomic loci encoding genes homologous to Drosophila Spz2, Spz4, Spz5, and Spz6 from the currently published genomic sequences of Ae. aegypti. In An. gambiae, six Spz homologues (Spz1-6) have been identified in the genomic sequence (19Luna C. Wang X. Huang Y. Zhang J. Zheng L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); however, we could not use Anopheles Spz1 sequences in multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses shown in Fig. 1, B and C, because the partial sequence published as Anopheles Spz1 is, as yet, missing the neutrophinlike cysteine knot domain (so-called C-106 region in Drosophila Spz) common to various Spz proteins. The phylogenetic studies using aligned C-106 of each Spz homologue suggest that three of them (TC36481, TC47492, and TC39244) belong to an orthologue group with Drosophila Spz, whereas five others form a 1:1 orthologue group with both Drosophila and Anopheles Spz2 to Spz6 (Fig. 1, B and C). Aedes Spz6 sequences were aligned with internal deletion of 73 amino acids (72 amino acids in Drosophila Spz6) based on the alignment of Drosophila Spz homologues (10Mizuguchi K. Parker J.S. Blundell T.L. Gay N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).The Tissue-specific Expression Profiles of Tolls and Spzs in Ae. aegypti—In Drosophila, the Toll pathway mediates immune responses specific to fungal and Gram (+) bacterial infections. The Toll (Toll-1) is the only identified Toll receptor involved in this pathway. We have chosen to limit our analysis to Ae. aegypti Tolls (Toll1A, 1B, 5A, 5B, and Toll4), which were grouped with Drosophila Toll (Fig. 1A). To understand possible respective functions of each Ae. aegypti Toll and Spz in immunity and/or embryogenesis, we first focused on the characterization of tissue-specific expression of the five Tolls and three Spz homologues (Spz1A, 1B, and 1C) with or without fungal challenge (Fig. 2). In addition, we tested gene expression during ovarian and embryonic development (Fig. 3). The transcript sizes for Toll1A or Toll5A were 4-5 kb. A 3- to 4-kb band was observed by means of Northern analysis of Toll1B or Toll4. The transcript sizes for Spz1A, Spz1B, and Spz1C were ∼1.5, ∼0.9, and ∼1.2 kb, respectively.FIGURE 2Tissue-specific expression profiles of Tolls and Spzs in Ae. aegypti.

Among these three Tolls, Toll5A was the most strongly activated in fat bodies and also inducible in ovarian tissues in an expression pattern very similar to that of Spn27A (Fig. 2), which was shown to be regulated by REL1 transcription factor (21Shin S.W. Kokoza V. Bian G. Cheon H.-M. Kim Y.J. Raikhel A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16499-16507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Bian G. Shin S.W. Cheon H.-M. Kokoza V. Raikhel A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13568-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Toll1A expression was weakly inducible in fat bodies, whereas strong non-inducible expression of Toll1A was observed in ovarian tissues (Fig. 2A). The expression of Toll5B was not detected using Northern analyses, but RT-PCR amplification of Toll5B mRNA suggested its inducible expression in the mosquito fat bodies (Fig. 2B). Toll4 was mainly expressed in ovarian tissues, although it was weakly expressed in a non-inducible manner in fat bodies (Fig. 2A). The expression of Toll1B was not detected either in fat bodies or ovarian tissues using Northern analyses or RT-PCR (Fig. 3A).The gene expression profiles of three Aedes homologues of Drosophila Spz were quite distinct from each other. Spz1A was expressed in fat bodies and ovarian tissues in an inducible manner by fungal challenge, whereas the expressions of Spz1B and Spz1C were non-inducible (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the expression of Spz1B was only observed in the ovary and that of Spz1C mainly in the fat body (Fig. 2A). The expressions of all tested Tolls and Spzs were not observed in the midgut (Fig. 2A).We tested these Tolls and Spzs expression patterns during mosquito ovary and egg development (Fig. 3). Toll5A, Toll1A, Toll4, and Sptz1B were expressed in pre-, vitellogenic, and postvitellogenic ovaries but not in eggs, suggesting their maternal origin. On the contrary, the expression of Toll1B was detected only in 1-day-old eggs and not during any other developmental stage (Fig. 3). These results suggest that Toll1B likely plays a role exclusively in embryonic development and that it is likely of zygotic origin.The Stage-specific and Pathogen-specific Expression Profiles of Tolls and Spzs in Ae. aegypti—Northern blot analyses were performed to examine the expression profiles of Tolls and Spzs in fourth instar larvae and in female and adult male mosquitoes after fungal challenge (Fig. 4A). Only naïve pupae were sampled because septic injury was lethal to mosquitoes at the pupal stage. The expressions of Toll5A and Toll1A were elevated after fungal challenge in larvae and in female and male mosquitoes (Fig. 4A). RT-PCR amplification of Toll5B mRNA showed inducible expression of Toll5B in larvae and in female and male mosquitoes after fungal infection (Fig. 4B). The expression of Spz1A and Spn27A was elevated in adult mosquitoes, but not in larvae, suggesting that there are different mechanisms of Toll immune activation between larvae and adult mosquitoes. Toll4 and Spz1C were constitutively expressed independently of fungal challenge (Fig. 4A). Expression of Spz1B was only detected in female mosquitoes (Fig. 4A), in accord with its strict ovary-specific expression (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 4Stage-, sex-, and pathogen-specific expression profiles of Tolls and Spzs.

https://openalex.org/W2028275047,"Calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels play a central role in regulating multiple physiological processes, from the control of blood flow to neuronal excitability. Coordinated regulation of BK channel activity by changes in actin cytoskeleton dynamics has been implicated in several of these processes and related disease states such as epilepsy and stroke. However, how BK channels interact with the actin cytoskeleton is essentially unknown. Here we demonstrate noncanonical Src homology domain 3 (SH3) binding site motifs in the intracellular C terminus of the BK channel pore-forming alpha-subunit that are conserved from fish to humans. These noncanonical motifs target multiple SH3 domain cellular signaling proteins to BK channels, including the SH3 adapter protein cortactin (EMS1). We demonstrate that cortactin provides a molecular bridge between BK channels and the cortical actin cytoskeleton in cells. Disruption of the SH3-mediated interaction prevents the regulation of BK channel activity controlled by changes in actin cytoskeletal dynamics. Targeting of cortactin to BK channels via a novel, noncanonical SH3 domain binding motif has important implications for the coordination of BK channel function in normal physiology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2168239899,"We recently established that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 promotes adipogenesis of primary human preadipocytes (phPA). In the current report, we have characterized the adipogenic effects of FGF-1 in phPA and also in a human PA strain derived from an individual with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS PA), which exhibit an intrinsic capacity to differentiate with high efficiency. In further studies, we compared these models with the well-characterized murine 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line (3T3-L1 PA). FGF-1 up-regulated the adipogenic program in phPA, with increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma in confluent PA prior to induction of differentiation and increased expression of adipocyte markers during differentiation. Moreover, phPA differentiated in the presence of FGF-1 were more insulin responsive and secreted increased levels of adiponectin. FGF-1 treatment of SGBS PA further enhanced differentiation. For the most part, the adipogenic program in phPA paralleled that observed in 3T3-L1 PA; however, we found no evidence of mitotic clonal expansion in the phPA. Finally, we investigated a role for extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in adipogenesis of phPA. FGF-1 induced robust phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in early differentiation and inhibition of ERK1/2 activity significantly reduced phPA differentiation. These data suggest that FGF-1 treated phPA represent a valuable in vitro model for the study of adipogenesis and insulin action and indicate that ERK1/2 activation is necessary for human adipogenesis in the absence of mitotic clonal expansion."

It remained stable with respect to variations in pressure, temperature, and further x-ray and laser exposure, thus opening new possibilities for studying molecular interactions in the hydrogen-oxygen binary system."
https://openalex.org/W2132597164,"Axonal transport of mitochondria and synaptic vesicle precursors via kinesin motor proteins is essential to keep integrity of axons and synapses. Disturbance of axonal transport is an early sign of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Treatment of cultured neurons by the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) stimulated phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in neurites. TNF treatment induced dissociation of the heavy chain kinesin family-5B (KIF5B) protein from tubulin in axons but not cell bodies as determined by lifetime-based Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis. Dissociation of KIF5B from tubulin after TNF treatment was dependent on JNK activity. Furthermore, TNF inhibited axonal transport of mitochondria and synaptophysin by reducing the mobile fraction via JNK. Thus, TNF produced by activated glial cells in inflammatory or degenerative neurological diseases acts on neurites by acting on the kinesin-tubulin complex and inhibits axonal mitochondria and synaptophysin transport via JNK."
https://openalex.org/W1979954254,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a life-threatening disorder with high mortality rates and limited treatment options. Gene therapy is an alternative treatment strategy, yet viral vectors have inherent disadvantages including immune activation. The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon is a nonviral method of gene delivery that overcomes some of these drawbacks. A SB-based transposon harboring a constitutively active endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene was administered to Sprague-Dawley rats via tail vein injection using the carrier polyethylenimine. Two days after transposon delivery, monocrotaline (MCT) was administered to induce PH. Hemodynamic, histological, and molecular measurements were performed four weeks later. Animals coinjected with transposase showed a significant reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure (PABP, 31.67+/-6.03 mmHg, P<0.01), an attenuation of right ventricle (RV) to whole heart (WH) wt ratios (0.227+/-0.0252, P<0.05) and a decrease in the pulmonary vessel wall thickness index (36.87%, P<0.001), compared with those animals receiving the eNOS transposon and a nonfunctional transposase (PABP 44.33+/-4.04 mmHg; RV/WH ratio 0.280+/-0.01; wall thickness index 62.14%) or control animals receiving MCT injection alone (PABP 49.67+/-3.22 mmHg; RV/WH ratio 0.290+/-0.0265; wall thickness index 71.99%). The physiological improvements correlated with therapeutic gene expression, suggesting that transposon-based genetic approaches have utility in the treatment of PH."
https://openalex.org/W2151258127,"An expansion in the CAG repeat of the IT15 (huntingtin) gene underlies the development of Huntington's disease (HD), but the basis for the specific vulnerability of dopamine-receptive striatal neurons remains unclear. To examine the potential role of the dopamine system in the emergence of pathological conditions in HD, we generated a double mutant mouse strain with both enhanced dopamine transmission and endogenous expression of a mutant huntingtin gene. This strain was generated by crossing the dopamine transporter knock-out mouse, which exhibits a 5-fold elevation in extracellular dopamine levels in the striatum and locomotor hyperactivity, to a knock-in mouse model of HD containing 92 CAG repeats. These double mutant mice exhibited an increased stereotypic activity at 6 months of age, followed by a progressive decline of their locomotor hyperactivity. Expression of the mutated huntingtin did not alter dopamine or its metabolite levels in normal or dopamine transporter knock-out mice. However, the mutant huntingtin protein aggregated much earlier and to a greater extent in the striatum and other dopaminergic brain regions in the hyperdopaminergic mouse model of HD. Furthermore, the formation of neuropil aggregates in the striatum and other regions of hyperdopaminergic HD mice was observed at 4 months of age, well before similar events occurred in normal HD mice (12 months). These findings indicate that dopamine contributes to the deleterious effects of mutated huntingtin on striatal function, and this is accompanied by enhanced formation of huntingtin aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W2091962676,"In alveolar epithelial cells, G-protein coupled-receptors agonists (GPCR) induce the recruitment of the Na,K-ATPase to the plasma membrane. Here we report that for the recruitment of the Na,K-ATPase to occur, dephosphorylation of its alpha1-subunit at serine 18 is necessary, as demonstrated by in vitro phosphorylation, mutation of the serine 18 to alanine, and use of a specific phospho-antibody. Several approaches strongly suggest dephosphorylation to be mediated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A): 1) Na,K-ATPase dephosphorylation and recruitment were prevented by okadaic acid (OA); 2) the Na,K-ATPase alpha1-subunit is an in vitro substrate for PP2A; and 3) glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins binding assays demonstrate a direct interaction between the catalytic subunit of PP2A and the first 90 amino acids of the Na,K-ATPase alpha1-subunit. Finally, GPCR agonists induced a rapid translocation of PP2A from the cytosol to the membrane fraction, which corresponded with increased coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization of PP2A and the Na,K-ATPase. Accordingly, we provide evidence that GPCR agonists promote PP2A translocation to the membrane fraction, leading to the dephosphorylation of the Na,K-ATPase alpha1-subunit at the serine 18 residue and its recruitment to the cell plasma membrane, which is of biological and physiological importance."
https://openalex.org/W2072833409,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF)-TM7 receptors CD97, EMR1, EMR2, EMR3, and EMR4 form a group of adhesion class heptahelical molecules predominantly expressed by cells of the immune system. These receptors bind cellular ligands through EGF-like domains, localized N-terminal to a large extracellular region. Remarkably, EMR2 possesses a chimeric structure with a seven-span transmembrane (TM7) region most related to EMR3 and an EGF domain region nearly identical to CD97. By comparing EGF-TM7 receptors in primates and dogs, we identified an intriguing pattern of concerted evolution, apparently mediated by gene conversion, among EMR2 and the oppositely orientated and physically adjacent genes CD97 and EMR3. This concerted evolution has continuously maintained the chimeric structure of EMR2 since early mammal radiation. Most highly conserved between EMR2 and CD97 is the fourth EGF domain, which mediates binding to chondroitin sulfate, a ligand specificity shared by both receptors. Another ligand, CD55, is bound effectively only by CD97. We show that different molecular mechanisms (mutations vs. alternative splicing) prevent CD55 binding by EMR2 in hominoids. Our findings illustrate how various and partially opposing evolutionary events have shaped the structure and ligand specificity of a modern mammalian gene family."

In humans, two copies of the SMN gene, SMN1 (telomeric) and SMN2 (centromeric), are located on chromosome 5q13 (6Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B.

These human SMN genes are very similar. However, transcripts from the SMN2 gene undergo alternative splicing and results in the production of low levels of full-length SMN mRNA and high levels of a truncated mRNA that lacks sequences derived from exon 7 (11Monani U.R.

The reduced amounts of full-length SMN protein causes disruption of multiprotein SMN complexes, including disruption of SMN-ZPR1 complexes in SMA patients (5Gangwani L. Mikrut M. Theroux S. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The co-localization of ZPR1 with SMN in nuclear bodies, including gems and Cajal bodies, observed in normal human cells is not observed in cells derived from SMA patients (5Gangwani L. Mikrut M. Theroux S. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). ZPR1 is required for accumulation of SMN in subnuclear bodies, including gems and Cajal bodies (4Gangwani L. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, the reduced expression of ZPR1 is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration in mice (20Doran B. Gherbesi N. Hendricks G. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Gangwani L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2744-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism that accounts for the requirement of ZPR1 for cell survival is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of ZPR1 deficiency on cell survival. I show that ZPR1 deficiency causes defects in histone gene expression, prevents DNA synthesis, and causes disruption of the subnuclear localization of proteins that are associated with DNA synthesis, including the DNA polymerase subunit proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the histone gene transcription factor, NPAT. Cell Culture—HeLa cells (Strain PV, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) and wild type human fibroblasts (WI-38, ATCC) were cultured in minimal Eagle's medium (MEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. HeLa cells were synchronized by double thymidine block (22Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Last T.J. Owen T. McCabe L. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, New York1994: 282-287Google Scholar) by sequential incubation of the cells in serum-free medium supplemented with 2 mm thymidine (12-16 h), growth medium with 24 μm deoxycytidine (9 h), and serum-free medium with 2 mm thymidine (12-16 h). The cells were released from the second thymidine block by washing with serum-free medium and the subsequent addition of growth medium supplemented with 24 μm deoxycytidine. The cells were harvested at different time intervals after release from the second thymidine block. WI-38 cells were arrested in the G0 phase of the cell cycle by serum starvation for 72 h in medium supplemented with 0.1% FBS. WI-38 cells were released from growth arrest by incubation in fresh growth medium with 10% FBS. Antisense Oligonucleotides—Second generation optimized antisense oligonucleotides were purchased from Oligos Etc. Inc. The experimental conditions optimized for knockdown of ZPR1 expression using antisense human ZPR1 oligonucleotide 5′-CATGGCCACCACGCG-CAATT-3′ and control oligonucleotide 5′-CACGGCTACCTCGCACAAGT-3′ (scrambled sequence) were employed (5Gangwani L. Mikrut M. Theroux S. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides labeled with or without FITC (0.4 nmol) in 100 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) were mixed with 100 μl of Opti-MEM containing 6 μl of Lipofectin (Invitrogen), diluted to 1 ml with Opti-MEM, and incubated (270 min) with subconfluent HeLa cells in 35-mm dishes at 37 °C. One ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% FBS was added and the cells were incubated at 37 °C (30 h). Transfection efficiency of FITC-conjugated oligonucleotides was monitored by flow cytometry. Greater than 95% of the cells were transfected with antisense oligonucleotides. Cell lysates were prepared and examined by immunoblot analysis. BrdUrd and BrUrd Incorporation Assay—Cells were labeled by incubation in medium supplemented with 50 μm BrdUrd (1 h). BrdUrd-labeled cells were detected by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy using a BrdUrd detection kit (BD Biosciences). Cells (95-98%) were gated to exclude dead cells and aggregates. The distribution of cells in different phases of the cell cycle was calculated by the Dean-Jett-Fox method using Flow-Jo software. The average of three independent experiments (mean ± S.D.; n = 3) is presented. The cells were also labeled with 2 mm 5′-bromouridine (BrUrd) for 2 h, and released for 2 h by substituting fresh medium without BrUrd for detection of in vivo transcription activity. BrUrd-labeled cells were detected using FITC-coupled anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells were cultured on glass coverslips, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4), and then briefly with chilled methanol. The cells were fixed at -20 °C with methanol (5 min) and acetone (2 min). The coverslips were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS with 0.5% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 30 min at 25 °C in Coplin jars and then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at 25°C (5Gangwani L. Mikrut M. Theroux S. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Double labeling (ZPR1/SMN) was carried out by sequential incubations (1 h) with anti-SMN (clone 2B1) (23Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), Texas Redconjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and then with FITC or Alexa 488-conjugated anti-ZPR1 (clone LG1, mouse monoclonal antibody raised against full-length human protein) (5Gangwani L.

Double labeling (ZPR1/NPAT) was carried out by sequential incubations (1 h) with anti-NPAT (Transduction Lab), Texas Redconjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and then with FITC or Alexa 488-conjugated anti-ZPR1 (clone LG1) at 25 °C. Double labeling (ZPR1/p80 Coilin) was carried out by sequential incubations (1 h) with rabbit anti-p80 Coilin (number R288) (24Andrade L.E. Tan E.M. Chan E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Double labeling (ZPR1/PCNA) was carried out by sequential incubations (1 h) with rabbit anti-PCNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Texas Redconjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody and then with FITC-conjugated anti-ZPR1 (clone LG1) at 25 °C. Processed coverslips were mounted on slides with mounting medium (Vectashield) containing 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss inverted microscope (Axiovert M200) or a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP2) equipped with a 405-nm diode laser. All the images were processed similarly and acquired under identical conditions by keeping all microscope parameters constant, including PMT voltage, aperture (pin hole), scan speed, and excitation and emission wavelengths. Northern Blot Analysis—HeLa cells were harvested after 30 h of transfection with antisense oligonucleotides. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Promega Corp.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Total RNA (10 μg) was separated by electrophoresis using denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred overnight onto a Zetaprobe membrane (Bio-Rad) by capillary action using 10× SSC buffer (3 m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate). The RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation using a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene). The blots were prehybridized in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 10 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA for 2 h at 65°C. Probes (32P-labeled) specific for the H4 histone (H4/n coding region) (25Mitra P. Xie R.L. Medina R. Hovhannisyan H. Zaidi S.K. Wei Y. Harper J.W. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. Mol. Cell.

RNA blots were washed in buffers starting at 2× SSC (0.1% SDS), followed by 1× SSC and a final rinse in 0.1× SSC (0.1% SDS) at 65 °C. Blots were subjected to autoradiographic exposure overnight at -70 °C or analyzed by using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In Situ Run-on Transcription—In situ run-on transcription was performed as described previously (26Pombo A. Jackson D.A. Hollinshead M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Cook P.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2241-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were processed after 30 h of transfection with antisense oligonucleotides. Cells were rinsed with PBS and then with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (PB), supplemented with 100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 units/ml RNasin. The cells were permeabilized using the same buffer supplemented with 0.05% Triton X-100 (5 min at 25 °C). The cells were washed with PB and then incubated in PB supplemented with 100 μm ATP, CTP, GTP, and BrUTP (30 min at 37 °C), washed with PB, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (15 min at 25 °C), washed with PBS, and stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. Double labeling (ZPR1/RNA) was carried out by sequential incubations (1 h) in PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100 with anti-ZPR1 (clone LG1), Alexa 546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody, and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-BrdUrd (clone PRB1, Molecular Probes) at 25 °C. Processed coverslips were mounted on slides with mounting medium containing DAPI. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP2) equipped with a 405-nm diode laser. Cell Cycle-dependent Distribution of ZPR1—ZPR1 is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of mammalian cells and redistributes from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to serum or mitogens (1Galcheva-Gargova Z. Konstantinov K.N. Wu I.H. Klier F.G. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Science. 1996; 272: 1797-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Gangwani L. Mikrut M. Theroux S. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mechanism of nuclear redistribution of ZPR1 in response to growth proliferation signals is unclear. To define the function of ZPR1 in cell growth and development, I examined the subcellular distribution of ZPR1 during progression of the cell cycle using immunofluorescence microscopy in human cells. Staining of synchronized HeLa cells that are at the boundary of G1/S (G1 phase) with anti-ZPR1 antibodies shows that ZPR1 is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 1A). ZPR1 is diffusely localized within the nucleus of G1 phase cells. ZPR1 begins to accumulate in subnuclear bodies during progression into the S phase (Fig. 1A). The number of ZPR1 containing nuclear bodies increases to ∼8 during S phase in HeLa cells. The amount of ZPR1 (detected by immunoblot analysis) does not change as the cells progress through S phase (Fig. 1C), but the overall fluorescence intensity dramatically decreases during S phase (Fig. 1A), most likely because of epitope masking that may occur when ZPR1 accumulates in subnuclear bodies. In contrast to the accumulation in subnuclear bodies (gems and Cajal bodies) during S phase, ZPR1 was diffusely localized throughout the cell during mitosis (metaphase, anaphase, and telophase) (Fig. 1A). These changes in the subcellular localization of ZPR1 contrast with the predominantly cytoplasmic localization of ZPR1 in serum-starved cells growth arrested in G0 that express decreased level of ZPR1 (Fig. 1C) (1Galcheva-Gargova Z.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To test the role of the cell cycle phase in the determination of the subcellular localization of ZPR1, I examined the effect of drugs that are known to cause cell cycle arrest. HeLa cells synchronized using a double thymidine block were incubated with serum (4 h) and subsequently with aphidicolin (S phase), hydroxyurea (S phase), or nocodazole (M phase) (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that ZPR1 was localized to subnuclear bodies, including gems and Cajal bodies, following treatment with aphidicolin or hydroxyurea. In contrast, ZPR1 was diffusely localized throughout the cells after treatment with nocodazole. It is possible that the loss of punctate nuclear staining of ZPR1 may be caused by the loss of nuclear membrane during G2/M phase or nocodazole treatment. Together, these data confirm that ZPR1 undergoes cell cycle dependent changes in subcellular localization, including an accumulation in subnuclear bodies during S phase (Fig. 1B). The nuclear accumulation observed during S phase suggests that ZPR1 may play a role during this phase of the cell cycle. ZPR1 Accumulates in Subnuclear Bodies during DNA Synthesis—To examine the role of ZPR1 containing subnuclear bodies (foci) during S phase of the cell cycle, I examined the number of ZPR1 foci present in cells during cell cycle progression in normal human WI-38 diploid fibroblasts. Cells growth arrested in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle by serum starvation were incubated with fresh medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The progression of cells through S phase was examined by pulse labeling cells with BrdUrd and analysis by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A). These data indicated that WI-38 cells enter S phase at ∼19 h following serum stimulation and that a large S phase population of cells is detected after 24 h (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that ZPR1 diffusely localized throughout the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm of serum-starved WI-38 fibroblasts (Fig. 2B). A similar diffuse localization of ZPR1 was observed at 6 h following serum stimulation (Fig. 2B) when the cells are predominantly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 2A). The BrdUrd incorporation was not detected in starved and cell released for 6 h (Fig. 2B). However, at 19 h, when cells enter S phase (Fig. 2A), ZPR1 accumulation in subnuclear bodies and BrdUrd incorporation was observed in cells (Fig. 2B). The increase in the number of ZPR1 subnuclear bodies was observed during S phase progression from 19 to 24 h as indicated by increased incorporation of BrdUrd (Fig. 2B). The cells containing different numbers of ZPR1 foci were examined by immunofluorescence analysis (Table 1). The subpopulation of cells containing 2 or more ZPR1 subnuclear foci and labeled with BrdUrd was examined by immunofluorescence and FACS analysis (Table 2). A variable number of subnuclear bodies were detected in individual focal planes, but analysis of multiple focal planes throughout the nucleus indicated that the prominent ZPR1-positive subnuclear bodies increased from 2 to 4 during S phase of the cell cycle in WI-38 fibroblasts.TABLE 1Number of ZPR1 foci in cultured WI-38 cellsZPR1 foci0-1 Foci2 Foci3 Foci4 FociTotal cells examinedSet-1 (No. of cells)258832100Set-2456634100Set-3254836100Set-4360631100Cells (mean ± S.D.)2.75 ± 0.9557 ± 2.57 ± 1.133.25 ± 2.2400 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Number of ZPR1 foci in cells present in S phase of the cell cycleZPR1 foci0-1 Foci2 Foci3 Foci4 FociTotal cells examinedBrdUrd+ cellsaDifferent batches of cells were examined by immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorting.IFFACS%Set-1 (cells)35773310039BrdUrd+ cells01063046Set-2 (cells)35663510041BrdUrd+ cells0953044a Different batches of cells were examined by immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Open table in a new tab The Co-localization of SMN and ZPR1 Is Cell Cycle-dependent—ZPR1 interacts with the SMN complex and both proteins co-localize in subnuclear bodies (5Gangwani L. Mikrut M. Theroux S. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To test whether this co-localization is cell cycle-dependent, I examined the subcellular distribution and localization of SMN and ZPR1 during cell cycle progression in normal human WI-38 diploid fibroblasts. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that ZPR1 and SMN are both diffusely localized throughout the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm of serum-starved WI-38 fibroblasts (Fig. 3A). A similar diffused subcellular distribution of ZPR1 and SMN was observed at 6 h following serum stimulation (Fig. 3A) when cells are predominantly in G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 2A). However at 19 h, when cells enter S phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 2), both ZPR1 and SMN were observed to co-localize in subnuclear bodies (Fig. 3A). Prominent nuclear bodies containing SMN and ZPR1 were observed in early S phase (19 h) and an increased number of subnuclear bodies were detected as the cells progressed through S phase (24 h). The increase in number of prominent ZPR1-positive subnuclear bodies from 2 to 4 during S phase of the cell cycle in diploid fibroblasts contrasts with observations made using HeLa (aneuploid human tumor) cells that indicated a larger (and more variable) number of ZPR1-positive subnuclear bodies that increased to approximately eight ZPR1-positive subnuclear bodies during S phase progression (Fig. 1). Together, these data indicate that both SMN and ZPR1 redistribute similarly during the cell cycle and accumulate in subnuclear bodies, including gems and Cajal bodies, in a cell cycle-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with our previous findings that the interaction of ZPR1 with SMN is reduced in serum-starved (G0/G1-phase) cells and increased in starved cells treated with serum (S phase) (5Gangwani L. Mikrut M. Theroux S. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Localization of ZPR1 with the Transcription Factor NPAT—The localization of ZPR1 to subnuclear bodies during S phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 2B) in human diploid fibroblasts resembles the localization of the transcription factor NPAT (27Ma T.

The increase in NPAT-positive subnuclear bodies from 2 to 4 in diploid cells during S phase progression is the result of constitutive interaction with chromosome 6p21 and an S phase-specific induction of an interaction with chromosome 1q21. In contrast, aneuploid human tumor cells with additional copies of chromosomes 1 and 6 exhibit a larger and more variable number of NPAT-positive subnuclear bodies that also increase in number during S phase progression. The cell cycle-dependent changes in NPAT localization (27Ma T. Van Tine B.A. Wei Y. Garrett M.D. Nelson D. Adams P.D. Wang J. Qin J. Chow L.T. Harper J.W.

https://openalex.org/W2019641284,"The spindle assembly checkpoint guards the fidelity of chromosome segregation. It requires the close cooperation of cell cycle regulatory proteins and cytoskeletal elements to sense spindle integrity. The role of the centrosome, the organizing center of the microtubule cytoskeleton, in the spindle checkpoint is unclear. We found that the molecular requirements for a functional spindle checkpoint included components of the large gamma-tubulin ring complex (gamma-TuRC). However, their localization at the centrosome and centrosome integrity were not essential for this function. Thus, the spindle checkpoint can be activated at the level of microtubule nucleation."

This is the first time that single round in vivo biopanning has been used to select human antibodies as candidates for diagnostic imaging and for obtaining insight into targets displayed in atherosclerotic plaques. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease in which the immune system interacts with risk factors to initiate, propagate, and activate lesions in the vasculature that are referred to as atherosclerotic plaques (1Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19248) Google Scholar, 2Hansson G.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (6987) Google Scholar). The rupture of such plaques and subsequent thromboembolism lead to cardiovascular disease, the major cause of death in Western countries. The early detection of atherosclerosis and the development of “smart” contrast agents to be used in a non-invasive procedure such as magnetic resonance imaging are critical for the diagnosis and management of vulnerable patients. An early event in plaque formation is the interaction of circulating platelets with activated endothelial cells (3Goncalves I. Nesbitt W.S. Yuan Y. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15430-15437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with ensuing leukocyte recruitment via soluble or cell surface signaling molecules such as proinflammatory cytokines and selectins. This cascade of events including the tight adhesion of platelets leads to local release of potent inflammatory mediators (IL1β and CD40L) at the injured site. The endothelial cells then show an enhanced expression of adhesion molecules including VCAM-1, I-CAM, and P-selectin as well as the release of MCP-1 and other chemokines. Their altered chemotactic and adhesive properties facilitate lymphocyte and monocyte transmigration into the intima of blood vessels. The “signature” provided by an atherosclerotic lesion surface is difficult to study in vitro (4Garlanda C. Dejana E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), even if progress in cell co-culture procedures allow mimicking of the disease (5Takahashi T. Hato F. Yamane T. Fukumasu H. Suzuki K. Ogita S. Nishizawa Y. Kitagawa S. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An alternative for overcoming this limitation is to probe the lesions in a high cholesterol fed rabbit model using a human phage-displayed single chain antibody library. Peptide phage display libraries have been particularly useful for the analysis and the isolation of amino acid sequences that target tissue or disease-affected endothelial cell (6Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1996; 380: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 7Ruoslahti E. Rajotte D. J. Biol.

However, to our knowledge, selection by in vivo phage display of human scFvs against atherosclerotic plaques has never been reported in the literature, despite the fact that human antibodies are the “gold standard” as clinical reagents both for diagnosis and for therapy (9Holliger P. Hudson P.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). In our study, we have combined in vivo biopanning of a monoclonal phage-display single-chain antibody (MoPhab) 2The abbreviations used are: MoPhab, monoclonal phage-displayed single-chain antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Amp, ampicillin; Kan, kanamycin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MPBS, milk-phosphate-buffered saline; pfu, plaque-forming unit; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tanden MS. 2The abbreviations used are: MoPhab, monoclonal phage-displayed single-chain antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Amp, ampicillin; Kan, kanamycin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MPBS, milk-phosphate-buffered saline; pfu, plaque-forming unit; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tanden MS. library and a high throughput screening procedure. After only one round of selection to avoid the loss of scFvs directed against rare epitopes, the eluted recombinant phages expressing mAbs have been secondarily screened by an original subtractive colony filter procedure. Described for the first time by Dreher et al. (10Dreher M.L. Gherardi E. Skerra A. Milstein C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), this method was recently used in combination with a robot picker for screening thousands of clones simultaneously (11De Wildt R. Mundy C. Gorick B. Tomlinson I. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Filter screening methods offer many advantages compared with classical random picking (12Giovannoni L. Viti F. Zardi L. Neri D.

Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), we have selected two scFvs, B3.3G and B3.GER, that specifically recognize epitopes expressed by atherosclerotic lesions. A protein of ∼56 kDa recognized by B3.3G was affinity-purified and identified by mass spectrometry analysis as vitronectin. ScFv human antibody fragments are potential vectors for directing therapeutic agents to injured sites or for non-invasive imaging after coupling with appropriate contrast agents (14Botnar R.M.

Animals—The investigation conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996), and the local ethics committee for animal experiments approved our procedures. Adult male Bourgogne brown rabbits were submitted for 8 months to an atherogenic diet including 0.3% cholesterol. Some of them were subjected to an angioplasty of the aorta (with a 3F balloon) under anesthesia by intramuscular administration of 20 mg/kg ketamine and 2 mg/kg xylazin. The denudation was performed 5 weeks and 1 week before sacrifice to allow the formation of complex plaques with intramural thrombi. Homozygous ApoE gene-inactivated (knock-out) mice were from a backcross onto a C57BL/6J background and were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (St Germain sur l'Arbresle, France). They were given a 0.25% cholesterol diet for 18 weeks. Tomlinson I+J Phage Libraries—The recombinant scFvs were issued from two different human antibody libraries (Library I and Library J provided by MRC Geneservice). Both libraries are based on a single human framework for VH (V3-23/DP-47 and JH4b) and Vκ (O12/O2/DPK9 and Jκ1) with side chain diversity (either DVT or NNK encoded) incorporated in complementary determining region 2 and complementary determining region 3 at positions in the antigen binding site that make contacts to antigen in known structures and are highly diverse in the mature repertoire. The libraries I and J are constructed in the pIT2 vector (derived from pHEN1), and the library size is about 1.4 × 108 different scFv fragments. Phage Library Preparation—Phage libraries were inoculated in 50 ml of 2TY medium (16 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter Bactoyeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, pH 7) + 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Amp) + 100 mm glucose to A600 = 0.03 at 37 °C and shaken at 250 rpm. When an A600 = 0.4 was reached, the culture was infected with 2 × 1011 M13KO7 helper phage (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min without shaking, followed by 30 min at 250 rpm. The cells were next harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 × g and the pellet was re-suspended in 50 ml of 2TY + 100 μg/ml Amp + 50 μg/ml kanamycin (Kan) + 100 μg/ml isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The MoPhabs were produced at 30 °C with agitation at 250 rpm overnight. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 × g. MoPhabs in the supernatant were precipitated with 0.20volume of 20% PEG/2.5 M NaCl solution for 6 h on ice with gentle shaking and pelleted for 45 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. The MoPhabs were re-suspended in 1 ml of sterile cold PBS and cleared of residual cell debris by an additional centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—MoPhabs were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk-phosphate-buffered saline (MPBS) for2hat room temperature. The g3p minor coat protein was detected with a mouse anti-g3p mAb (1:1000) (Mobitec, Gottingen, Germany) for 2 h at room temperature. After three washings with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 buffer (PBST), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) (1:5000) was used for detection and visualized by ECL (Pierce, Brebières, France). In Vivo Biopanning—The phage libraries (I+J) were mixed, and 1013 pfu were injected intravenously under anesthesia in the rabbit marginal ear vein in a total volume of 2 ml of PBS. After 2 h, the animal was sacrificed by an overdose of anesthetic and perfused via the heart with 200 ml of PBS to wash out the unbound phages. The aorta was then removed from the aortic arch to the iliac bifurcation, washed, and divided into several sections corresponding to: the aortic arch, the superior thoracic aorta, the inferior thoracic aorta, the superior abdominal aorta, and the inferior abdominal aorta. The bound phages were eluted using a two-step method. After extensive washing in PBS, the aortic segments were weighed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and hand-homogenized in a mortar under liquid nitrogen. All the following procedures were performed on ice. MoPhabs associated with surface lesions were first eluted using 500 μl of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.2, for 15 min and neutralized with 50 μlof2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8. A mixture of protease inhibitors was added at a dilution recommended by the manufacturer (Sigma). Phages were recovered after a centrifugation step (5000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C). RPMI medium supplemented with 20% radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40), and the same mixture of protease inhibitors was used to re-suspend the pellet that was homogenized 30 s (four pulses) with a Polytron TP-20 homogenizer (Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland). Twenty ml of XL1-Blue bacteria (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in log phase were added (i) to the 0.1 m glycine isolated phages and (ii) to the tissue homogenate, for 15 min without shaking to allow infection with eluted phages and 45 min with shaking. Phages were then titered by serially diluting the infected bacteria in 2TY medium and plating them out in parallel on Amp and Kan agar plates for incubation overnight at 37 °C. Histology and NMR Microscopy Imaging of Aortic Sections— Segments near the sections to be eluted were excised and immersed in buffered paraformaldehyde for immediate NMR microscopy imaging at 9.4 tesla. FLASH sequence parameters were: echo time/repetition time, 2.6 ms/12 ms; angle, 15°; acquisitions, 12; field of view, 10 × 9.9 × 9.9 mm; matrix, 128 × 110 × 110; resolution, 78 × 90 × 90 μm; total scan time, 30 min. The embedded segments of the aorta were further sectioned (8 μm) and, after deparaffinization, processed for staining with Masson's trichrome for histological examination of neutral lipid, thrombi, fibrous, and cellular components. Sections from each segment were examined for lesion formation using a light microscope (Nikon Microphot Fx). Protein Extraction and Coating onto Nitrocellulose Filters— Aortas from rabbits fed a normal or an atherogenic diet but which did not receive recombinant phages were removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The aortas were weighed and hand-homogenized in a mortar in liquid nitrogen. The powder was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors. Further disruption was performed using a Polytron homogenizer. Homogenates were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min to collect the supernatant containing proteins whose concentration was measured using the Bradford assay (Pierce, Perbio Science). SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining was used to assess the extraction of proteins from atherosclerotic (Fig. 1a) and normal aorta (Fig. 1b). The two antigen-coated filters (atherosclerotic protein-coated filter and normal aorta protein-coated filter) were prepared as follows. Briefly, two 80-mm nitrocellulose membranes (Protan BA85, Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany) were coated overnight at 4 °C in 15 ml of PBS containing 50μg/ml protein extract of each. Coating efficiency was evaluated histochemically using a mouse mAb (RAM-11) directed against rabbit macrophage IgG receptor (16Tsukada T. Rosenfeld M. Ross R. Gown A.M. Atherosclerosis. 1986; 6: 601-613Crossref Google Scholar) on filters containing proteins from atherosclerotic plaques (Fig. 1c) or from normal aorta (Fig. 1d). RAM-11 was detected by an enzymatic diaminobenzidine colorimetric reaction using an anti-mouse IgG-biotinylated antibody followed by peroxidase-labeled streptavidin. The helper phage was used as a negative control (Fig. 1, e and f). Two-filter Subtractive Colony Lift Assay with MoPhabs—The library in pIT2 vector selected in vivo was stored in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue strain. Several dilutions were plated onto a 90-mm 2TYAG (2TY + 100 μg/ml Amp + 100 mm glucose) plate and left to grow overnight at 37 °C. The plate containing well separated single colonies, at a density of about 103 colonies per plate, was chosen for the subtractive colony lift assay (master plate). Two nitrocellulose filters were blocked in 2% MPBS, washed, soaked in 2TY, dried, and used to make two oriented replicas (bacteria filters) of the master plate. They were then laid, colonies uppermost on a 2TYAG solid agar plate, and allowed to grow for a further hour at 37 °C. Next, a helper phage M13KO7 stock was diluted in soft agarose solution (0.7%) at 37 °C (1012 phage) and overlayered on the two bacteria filters. After the soft agarose had solidified, the 2TYAG plates were left for 1 h at 37 °Cto allow the helper phage infection. In the meantime, the antigen-coated filters were blocked in 5% MPBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times in PBS soaked in 2TY medium, and transferred onto a 2TY + 100 μg/ml isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside + 100 μg/ml Amp + 50 μg/ml Kana solid medium (2TY AKI). The two bacteria filters covered by the M13KO7-containing agar were then carefully removed with tweezers and replaced on their respective antigen-coated filters on 2TY AKI for overnight MoPhab induction at 30 °C. This medium allowed the selection and the induction of bacteria containing a recombinant pIT2 vector (Amp resistance) and infected by the helper phage (Kan resistance). The produced MoPhabs diffuse from the bacteria filter to the antigen filter placed on top of the solid medium and bind to their respective targets. The next day, the antigen-coated filters were removed and washed three times in PBST (0.1%). The two filters were then incubated with an anti-g8p (anti-M13) mAb for 3 h at 37 °C. After three washes in PBST (0.1%), a third incubation was carried out with a biotinylated antibody to mouse IgG diluted 1/1000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) followed by peroxidase-labeled streptavidin diluted 1/5000. Bound MoPhabs were detected by chemiluminescence using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Pierce). The spots giving a signal on the atherosclerotic protein filter (see Fig. 1g, black arrows) with no labeling of the normal aorta protein filter (Fig. 1h) were used to identify the corresponding colonies on the master plate. The selected clones responsible for the production of specific MoPhabs were removed with a toothpick, inoculated in 5 ml of 2TY medium + 100 μg/ml Amp + 100 mm glucose, and grown overnight at 37 °C for further plasmid preparations. PCR and Restriction Analysis of Selected Clones—The scFv DNA inserts of selected clones were amplified by a PCR performed directly on colonies using pIT2 primers: LMB3 (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′) and pHENseq (5′-CTATGCGGCCCCATTCA-3′). One μg of the plasmid preparations was digested with restriction enzymes NcoI/NotI (Promega) for 1 h at 37°C. PCR and digestion products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels. Phage-scFv Reactivity Determined by ELISA—Ninety-six-well plates were coated overnight, at 4 °C, with 50 μg/ml protein extracts from atherosclerotic aorta, normal aorta, bovine serum albumin, or 5 μg/ml vitronectin in NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.6. Bound MoPhabs were labeled with an anti-M13 mAb diluted 1/500 in 0.5% MPBS. After a 2-h incubation, a 1/1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was added and incubated for 90 min. Color was developed with 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and the absorbance was read at 405 nm with an Emax precision microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Expression and Purification of Soluble scFv Antibodies—The scFvs genes were cloned into the vector pHOG21 for soluble expression. The scFv genes of selected MoPhabs were digested into pIT2 with NcoI and NotI, separated on agarose gel, and purified. Fragments were next ligated to NcoI-NotI-digested pHOG21. Transformed XL1-Blue E. coli bacteria were grown overnight in 2TY medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 100 mm glucose at 37 °C. The soluble scFvs were expressed as described previously (17Robert R. Noubhani A.M. Jacobin M.J. Santarelli X. Clofent-Sanchez G. J. Chromatogr. B. 2005; 818: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) by preparing periplasmic extracts on a small scale and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin columns (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunohistochemical Analysis on Rabbit and Human Atherosclerotic Sections—Paraffin-embedded sections of aortic tissue were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase blocked with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin. MoPhabs (1011 pfu per section) or diluted scFv preparations were applied for 2 h at room temperature. Following three washes with PBS, a diluted mouse anti-g8p antibody (Amersham Biosciences) (1/500) or anti-c-Myc antibody (1/200) was applied to the sections for 1 h at room temperature. After a further three washes with PBS, staining was performed using a peroxidase-labeled biotinstreptavidin complex (Amersham Biosciences). The substrate for the peroxidase was diaminobenzidine (Vector) with H2O2. It yielded a yellow brown deposit. In Vivo Homing of Individual MoPhabs in ApoE Mice—Binding of MoPhab B3.3G was determined in vivo to atherosclerotic lesions developed in ApoE mice. Injections were performed in the tail vein of animals anesthetized via inhaled isofluorane. After 30 min, the mice were perfused with sterile PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde for fixation. The aortas were removed by dissection and cleaned, opened longitudinally, and immobilized in a Petri dish with needles. The endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited with 3% H2O2 before application of the anti-M13 peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at 1/1000 dilution. After three washes with PBS, the reaction was developed with diaminobenzidine substrate. Immunoblot Analysis—Protein extracts from atherosclerotic or from normal aortas were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% MPBS and incubated with B3.3G-soluble scFv for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, the membranes were successively incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-His tag antibody (Qiagen) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Bound scFv were detected by chemiluminescence using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Proteins (1 mg) extracted either from atherosclerotic aorta or from normal aorta were first subjected to a control incubation for 2 h with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody coupled to superparamagnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). After being applied to the magnetic column (Miltenyi Biotech), the flow-through containing the proteins was next subjected to immunoprecipitation. Soluble scFvs with c-Myc inserts were incubated overnight at 4 °C under rotation. The next day, scFvs bound to their targets were incubated for 2 h with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody coupled to superparamagnetic microbeads. The antigens were then eluted from the magnetic column and separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels. Bands that appeared using the atherosclerotic aorta protein extract but not for that of controls (normal aorta protein extract with or without scFv addition) were cut out and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on the Functional Genomics Plateform of Bordeaux University. The protein band at ∼56 kDa was excised after SDS-PAGE, digested in trypsin, and submitted to on-line capillary chromatography (LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) coupled to a nanospray LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode. Data acquisition was performed in a data-dependant mode consisting of, alternatively in a single run, a full scan MS over the range m/z 300-2000 and three full scan MS/MS of the most intense ions in the preceding MS spectra. Proteins were identified by peptide mass mapping using SEQUEST (ThermoFinnigan, Torrence, CA) against the Swiss-Prot data base. A more detailed description of the procedure is described elsewhere (18Lasserre J.P. Beyne E. Pyndiah S. Lapaillerie D. Claverol S. Bonneu M. Electrophoresis. 2006; 27: 3306-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In Vivo Biopanning and Recovery of Bound MoPhabs—We have used a human scFv library in the pIT2 phagemid vector. Before proceeding to the in vivo selection, we confirmed by Western blotting the presence of scFvs fused to the g3p proteins of the phage. We then injected 1013 MoPhabs into the marginal ear vein of a rabbit fed with a high cholesterol diet and with advanced atherosclerotic plaques. The MoPhabs were allowed to circulate for 2 h. To minimize the selection against immunodominant epitopes expressed in atherosclerotic lesions and to retain the diversity of binders, only a single round of selection was performed. A 2-h circulation also permitted entry of MoPhabs within the plaque. After animal sacrifice and abundant washes, the aorta was harvested and ring sections surrounding the MoPhab elution area were analyzed by histology and ex vivo NMR microscopy imaging to check for the presence of atherosclerotic plaques. A two-step elution protocol was used. After mechanical homogenization of the aorta, bound phages were first eluted at acidic pH and then neutralized (supernatant fraction). Aorta homogenate was next disrupted mechanically several times in a soft lysis buffer for recovery of internalized phages (pellet fraction). We have recovered 1.6 × 107 phages/g of tissue in the supernatant fraction, while 3 × 106 phages/g were recovered in the pellet (internalized phages). Histological Analysis and NMR Microscopy Imaging—To confirm the presence of atherosclerotic lesions in the area of elution, adjacent ring sections were monitored by histomorphometric trichrome staining (Fig. 2, b, d, f, and h) and by ex vivo high resolution NMR microscopy imaging (Fig. 2, a, c, e, and g). After eight months of cholesterol diet, the aorta showed complex plaque formation (Fig. 2, d, f, and h) with intimal thickening and macrophage infiltration in high shear stress regions that led to the formation of necrotic cores (Fig. 2, d and f, red arrows). After histochemical staining, macrophages have purple coloring while the collagen fibers have green coloring. Intramural thrombi (Fig. 2f) or blood decomposition products issuing from intraplaque hemorrhage (Fig. 2h) have developed after angioplasty-induced injury and appeared, respectively, as red or black coloring in histology. A significant correlation between ex vivo NMR microscopy imaging and histological staining was observed concerning the visualization of plaque constituents. Different signal intensities are given by distinct plaque components, i.e. fibrous tissue, necrotic core, thrombi. Foam cells with high lipid content gave a gray signal on NMR microscopy images. In Fig. 2d, macrophage and collagen fibers are interspersed, leading to non-uniform coloring in the corresponding NMR microscopy image (Fig. 2c). They are closely packed, defining a high cellular density both in the subendothelial layer and deeper in the intima (Fig. 2, c and d). For the fibrous tissue with high collagen content, a brighter signal is detected (Fig. 2e). Intramural thrombi (Fig. 2, f and h, green arrow) and opti-cally null regions such as necrotic cores (Fig. 2, d, f, and h, red and green arrows) appear as dark areas (Fig. 2e) or as a focal signal loss (Fig. 2, c and g). Ex vivo NMR microscopy imaging allows a fast and efficient confirmation of plaque composition before phage elution. Analysis of MoPhabs by ELISA—To confirm the reactivity of colony filter selected clones containing a full-length insert (800 bp), MoPhabs were screened using a conventional ELISA against atherosclerotic plaque proteins and those from normal aorta sections. As can be seen in Fig. 3, after one round of in vivo biopanning and selection by subtractive colony screening, ELISA reactivity of most of the selected MoPhabs was stronger using the atherosclerotic protein extract, especially for B2-7, B2-10, B2-11, B2-12, B3-GER, and B3-3G clones. Immunohistological Analysis—After ELISA analysis, reactive MoPhabs were tested for binding specificity to early atherosclerotic lesions, to more complicated lesions obtained after balloon angioplasty in a rabbit model and to human carotid lesions. Sections of respective lesions were stained with Masson's trichrome to show the morphology of the different plaques (Fig. 4, a-c). Deparaffinized sections of diseased and healthy aortas were incubated with 1010 pfu of MoPhabs or insertless phage as a control. Two MoPhabs called B3.3G (Fig. 4e) and B3.GER (Fig. 4f) showed similar and specific binding to the intimal surface of early atherosclerotic lesions. When the same number of insertless phages was applied on an adjacent section, no binding was detected (Fig. 4d). Anti-M13 antibody plus secondary antibodies have also served as negative co"

https://openalex.org/W2034032253,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the oxidative DNA damage they produce [e.g., 8-oxo-guanine and apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites] have been linked to the pathogenesis of several age-related and chronic diseases. The basal number of AP sites measured in DNA by immuno-slot-blot analysis ranges from 70,000 to 100,000 per genome. We used electron microscopy to determine how AP sites were distributed in isolated DNA fibers from fresh calf thymus and HeLa cell cultures. We observed that AP sites were not equally distributed throughout all the fibers. A small percentage of the analyzed DNA fibers contained a disproportionate amount of the total AP sites in nonrandom groups of 10 to >30 closely spaced in a small region (e.g., 20 AP sites in a 6 kb length of DNA). This finding suggests that genomic sites may differ in their vulnerability to ROS damage, perhaps because of local chromatin structure. Nonrandom AP site formation also suggests that the detrimental effects of ROS in the development of disease may be related not simply to the total number of AP sites present but to how AP sites are distributed along a DNA fiber and, perhaps, to the genomic sites affected."

https://openalex.org/W2019986463,"Adenoviral E1A is a versatile protein that can reprogram host cells for efficient viral replication. The nuclear import of E1A is mediated by a nuclear localization signal; however, whether E1A can be actively exported from the nucleus is unknown. We first reported a CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES) in E1A that is conserved in the group C adenoviruses. We showed that CRM1 and E1A coimmunoprecipitated and that blockage of CRM1 function by leptomycin B or small interfering RNA resulted in the nuclear localization of E1A. Through mutational analyses, we identified an active canonical NES element within the E1A protein spanning amino acids 70-80. We further demonstrated that phosphorylation of adjacent serine (S)89 resulted in the cytoplasmic accumulation of E1A. Interestingly, coincident with the accumulation of cells in the S/G2/M phase and histone H1 phosphorylation, E1A was relocated to the cytoplasm at the late stage of the viral cycle, which was blocked by the CDC2/CDK2 inhibitor roscovitine. Importantly, titration of the progenies of the viruses in infected cells showed that the replication efficiency of the NES mutant adenovirus was up to 500-fold lower than that of the wild-type adenovirus. Collectively, our data demonstrate the existence of a NES in E1A that is modulated by the phosphorylation of the S89 residue and the NES plays a role for an efficient viral replication in the host cells."
