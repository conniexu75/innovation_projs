https://openalex.org/W3170480891,"Background Various public health measures have been implemented globally to counter the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate respiratory virus surveillance data to determine the effectiveness of such interventions in reducing transmission of seasonal respiratory viruses. Method We retrospectively analysed data from the Respiratory Virus Detection Surveillance System in Canada, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, by interrupted time series regression. Results The national level of infection with seasonal respiratory viruses, which generally does not necessitate quarantine or contact screening, was greatly reduced after Canada imposed physical distancing and other quarantine measures. The 2019–2020 influenza season ended earlier than it did in the previous year. The influenza virus was replaced by rhinovirus/enterovirus or parainfluenza virus in the previous year, with the overall test positivity remaining at approximately 35%. However, during the 2019–2020 post-influenza period, the overall test positivity of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 was still low (7.2%). Moreover, the 2020–2021 influenza season had not occurred by the end of February 2021. Conclusion Respiratory virus surveillance data may provide real-world evidence of the effectiveness of implemented public health interventions during the current and future pandemics."

An online questionnaire was administered to a heterogeneous sample of French citizens ( N = 1025) during the first French lockdown related to the outbreak. Results revealed a significant evolution of values; the conservation value was higher during the outbreak than usual, and both self-enhancement and openness-to-change values were lower during the COVID-19 outbreak than usual. Conservation and perceived threat during the outbreak were robustly and positively related to both compliance with movement restrictions and social distancing. Conservation during the outbreak emerged as a significant partial mediator of the relationship between perceived threat and outcomes (i.e., compliance with movement restrictions and social distancing). Implications of these results for the malleability of values and the COVID-19 modelling are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3168929822,"Type three secretion is the mechanism of protein secretion found in bacterial flagella and injectisomes. At its centre is the export apparatus (EA), a complex of five membrane proteins through which secretion substrates pass the inner membrane. While the complex formed by four of the EA proteins has been well characterised structurally, little is known about the structure of the membrane domain of the largest subunit, FlhA in flagella, SctV in injectisomes. Furthermore, the biologically relevant nonameric assembly of FlhA/SctV has been infrequently observed and differences in conformation of the cytoplasmic portion of FlhA/SctV between open and closed states have been suggested to reflect secretion system specific differences. FlhA has been shown to bind to chaperone-substrate complexes in an open state, but in previous assembled ring structures, SctV is in a closed state. Here, we identify FlhA and SctV homologues that can be recombinantly produced in the oligomeric state and study them using cryo-electron microscopy. The structures of the cytoplasmic domains from both FlhA and SctV are in the open state and we observe a conserved interaction between a short stretch of residues at the N-terminus of the cytoplasmic domain, known as FlhAL/SctVL, with a groove on the adjacent protomer's cytoplasmic domain, which stabilises the nonameric ring assembly."

The goal of this study is to develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict complete and incremental tooth loss among adults and to compare the predictive performance of these models. Methods We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2011 to 2014. We developed multiple machine-learning algorithms and assessed their predictive performances by examining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. Results The extreme gradient boosting trees presented the highest performance in the prediction of edentulism (AUC = 88.7%; 95%CI: 87.1, 90.2), the absence of a functional dentition (AUC = 88.3% 95%CI: 87.3,89.3) and for predicting missing any tooth (AUC = 83.2%; 95%CI, 82.0, 84.4). Although, as expected, age and routine dental care emerged as strong predictors of tooth loss, the machine learning approach identified additional predictors, including socioeconomic conditions. Indeed, the performance of models incorporating socioeconomic characteristics was better at predicting tooth loss than those relying on clinical dental indicators alone. Conclusions Future application of machine-learning algorithm, with longitudinal cohorts, for identification of individuals at risk for tooth loss could assist clinicians to prioritize interventions directed toward the prevention of tooth loss."

Based on Google Earth engine and Sentinel-2 images, an automatic water extraction model in complex environment(AWECE) was developed. The accuracy of water extraction by AWECE, NDWI, MNDWI and the revised version of multi-spectral water index (MuWI-R) models was evaluated from visual interpretation and quantitative analysis. The results show that the AWECE model could significantly improve the accuracy of water extraction in complex environment, with an overall accuracy of 97.16%, and an extremely low omission error (0.74%) and commission error (2.35%). The AEWCE model could effectively avoid the influence of cloud shadow, mountain shadow and paddy soil on water extraction accuracy. The model can be widely applied in cloudy, mountainous and other areas with complex environments, which has important practical significance for water resources investigation, monitoring and protection."
https://openalex.org/W3172900253,"Amphiphilic block co-polymer nanoparticles are interesting candidates for drug delivery as a result of their unique properties such as the size, modularity, biocompatibility and drug loading capacity. They can be rapidly formulated in a nanoprecipitation process based on self-assembly, resulting in kinetically locked nanostructures. The control over this step allows us to obtain nanoparticles with tailor-made properties without modification of the co-polymer building blocks. Furthermore, a reproducible and controlled formulation supports better predictability of a batch effectiveness in preclinical tests. Herein, we compared the formulation of PLGA-PEG nanoparticles using the typical manual bulk mixing and a microfluidic chip-assisted nanoprecipitation. The particle size tunability and controllability in a hydrodynamic flow focusing device was demonstrated to be greater than in the manual dropwise addition method. We also analyzed particle size and encapsulation of fluorescent compounds, using the common bulk analysis and advanced microscopy techniques: Transmission Electron Microscopy and Total Internal Reflection Microscopy, to reveal the heterogeneities occurred in the formulated nanoparticles. Finally, we performed in vitro evaluation of obtained NPs using MCF-7 cell line. Our results show how the microfluidic formulation improves the fine control over the resulting nanoparticles, without compromising any appealing property of PLGA nanoparticle. The combination of microfluidic formulation with advanced analysis methods, looking at the single particle level, can improve the understanding of the NP properties, heterogeneities and performance."

This paper investigates the effects of children's intergenerational economic support and non-economic support on physical, mental, and functional health of rural elderly in China in the mean while. This paper applies the 2014 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), in particular, applying exploratory factor analysis to ascertain latent variables and Structural Equation Model (SEM), and analyzes the impacts of ""Upward"" intergenerational support on health of rural elderly. As resulted, after controlling the socioeconomic status of the rural elderly, the family ""upward"" intergenerational support influences the elderly's physical health at a percentage of 11.7%, mental health 29.8%, and physiological function 12.6%. Moreover, ""Upward"" economic support has a positive effect on physiological function (P<0.05). ""Upward"" non-economic support has negative effects on physiological function and mental health (P<0.05), while it has a positive effect on physical health. In addition, economically independent rural elderly are more likely to benefit from the health of ""upward"" intergenerational support, especially mental health. In particular, those results are robust. ""Upward"" intergenerational support plays an important role for the health of rural elderly. For the rural elderly of economic independence, to improve the quality of care and spiritual support, it is important to solve the health problems. In addition, it is necessary to build a comprehensive old-age security and support system for family, community, and society jointly to improve the health of the rural elderly."
https://openalex.org/W3169222793,"In order for healthcare systems to prepare for future waves of COVID-19, an in-depth understanding of clinical predictors is essential for efficient triage of hospitalized patients.We performed a retrospective cohort study of 259 patients admitted to our hospitals in Rhode Island to examine differences in baseline characteristics (demographics and comorbidities) as well as presenting symptoms, signs, labs, and imaging findings that predicted disease progression and in-hospital mortality.Patients with severe COVID-19 were more likely to be older (p = 0.02), Black (47.2% vs. 32.0%, p = 0.04), admitted from a nursing facility (33.0% vs. 17.9%, p = 0.006), have diabetes (53.9% vs. 30.4%, p<0.001), or have COPD (15.4% vs. 6.6%, p = 0.02). In multivariate regression, Black race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-3.9) and diabetes (aOR 2.2, 95%CI: 1.3-3.9) were independent predictors of severe disease, while older age (aOR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), admission from a nursing facility (aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1-6.7), and hematological co-morbidities predicted mortality (aOR 3.4, 95% CI 1.1-10.0). In the first 24 hours, respiratory symptoms (aOR 7.0, 95% CI: 1.4-34.1), hypoxia (aOR 19.9, 95% CI: 2.6-152.5), and hypotension (aOR 2.7, 95% CI) predicted progression to severe disease, while tachypnea (aOR 8.7, 95% CI: 1.1-71.7) and hypotension (aOR 9.0, 95% CI: 3.1-26.1) were associated with increased in-hospital mortality.Certain patient characteristics and clinical features can help clinicians with early identification and triage of high-risk patients during subsequent waves of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3170982515,"Marine gelatin is one of the food proteins used in food and non-food products, offering desirable functionalities such as gelling, thickening, and binding. Jellyfish has been chosen for this gelatin research, in view of the benefits of its main collagen protein and lower fat content, which may reduce the amounts of chemicals used in the preparative steps of gelatin production. To date, the lack of identified proteins in gelatin has limited the understanding of differentiating intrinsic factors quantitatively and qualitatively affecting gel properties. No comparison has been made between marine gelatin of fish and that of jellyfish, regarding protein type and distribution differences. Therefore, the study aimed at characterizing jellyfish gelatin extracted from by-products, that are i.e., pieces that have broken off during the grading and cleaning step of salted jellyfish processing. Different pretreatment by hydrochloric acid (HCl) concentrations (0.1 and 0.2 M) and hot water extraction time (12 and 24 h) were studied as factors in jellyfish gelatin extraction. The resultant jellyfish gelatin with the highest gel strength (JFG1), as well as two commercial gelatins of fish gelatin (FG) and bovine gelatin (BG), were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results show that the jellyfish gelatin (JFG1) extracted with 0.1 M HCl at 60°C for 12 h delivered a maximum gel strength of 323.74 g, which is lower than for FG and BG, exhibiting 640.65 and 540.06 g, respectively. The gelling and melting temperatures of JFG1 were 7.1°C and 20.5°C, displaying a cold set gel and unstable gel at room temperature, whereas the gelling and melting temperatures of FG and BG were 17.4°C, 21.3°C, and 27.5°C, 32.7°C, respectively. Proteomic analysis shows that 29 proteins, of which 10 are types of collagen proteins and 19 are non-collagen proteins, are common to all BG, FG, and JFG1, and that JFG1 is missing 3 other collagen proteins (collagen alpha-2 (XI chain), collagen alpha-2 (I chain), and collagen alpha-2 (IV chain), that are important to gel networks. Thus, the lack of these 3 collagen types influences the inferior gel properties of jellyfish gelatin."
https://openalex.org/W3172160997,"As part of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination strategy in South Africa, it is essential to have information on HPV prevalence, and HPV types distribution among the unvaccinated population. Information on the prevalence of HPV and the distribution of HPV types in adolescents and young women in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province is minimal. Therefore, this study investigates the prevalence, distribution of HPV types, and factors associated with HPV infection amongst unvaccinated female learners. A sample composed of 213 sexually active female learners attending high schools in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa; median age 18 years, who provided self-collected vaginal specimens. Roche Linear Array HPV genotyping assay that detects 37 HPV genotypes was used to detect HPV infection. HPV infection was detected in 76.06% (162/213) of participants. Of these 14.55% (31/213) were positive for HPV types targeted by the Cervarix® HPV vaccine (HPV-16 and/or 18), 20.66% (44/213) by Gardasil®4 (HPV-6, -11, -16 and/or -18) and 37.09% (79/213) by Gardasil®9 (HPV-6, -11, -16, -18, -31, -33, -45, -52 and/or -58). HPV-35, commonly detected in cervical cancer cases among women of African ancestry, was frequently detected (9.40%). Participants who reported to have ever consumed alcohol had a significantly higher risk of HPV infection (OR: 2.91, 95% CI: 1.38-6.11, p = 0.005). High HPV prevalence was observed among participants. The high prevalence of HPV types targeted by the Gardasil®9 vaccine encourages the introduction of the Gardasil®9 vaccine. Data from this study will inform both vaccination campaigns and monitor the impact on HPV types after vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3169130436,"A potent therapy for the infectious coronavirus disease COVID-19 is urgently required with, at the time of writing, research in this area still ongoing. This study aims to evaluate the in vitro anti-viral activities of combinations of certain commercially available drugs that have recently formed part of COVID-19 therapy. Dual combinatory drugs, namely; Lopinavir-Ritonavir (LOPIRITO)-Clarithromycin (CLA), LOPIRITO-Azithromycin (AZI), LOPIRITO-Doxycycline (DOXY), Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)-AZI, HCQ-DOXY, Favipiravir (FAVI)-AZI, HCQ-FAVI, and HCQ-LOPIRITO, were prepared. These drugs were mixed at specific ratios and evaluated for their safe use based on the cytotoxicity concentration (CC 50 ) values of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. The anti-viral efficacy of these combinations in relation to Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated from a patient in Universitas Airlangga hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia and evaluated for IC 50 24, 48, and 72 hours after viral inoculation was subsequently determined. Observation of the viral load in qRT-PCR was undertaken, the results of which indicated the absence of high levels of cytotoxicity in any samples and that dual combinatory drugs produced lower cytotoxicity than single drugs. In addition, these combinations demonstrated considerable effectiveness in reducing the copy number of the virus at 48 and 72 hours, while even at 24 hours, post-drug incubation resulted in low IC 50 values. Most combination drugs reduced pro-inflammatory markers, i.e. IL-6 and TNF-α, while increasing the anti-inflammatory response of IL-10. According to these results, the descending order of effective dual combinatory drugs is one of LOPIRITO-AZI&gt;LOPIRITO-DOXY&gt;HCQ-AZI&gt;HCQ-FAVI&gt;LOPIRITO-CLA&gt;HCQ-DOX. It can be suggested that dual combinatory drugs, e.g. LOPIRITO-AZI, can potentially be used in the treatment of COVID-19 infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3166606518,"The complex relationship between intimate partner violence and psychological distress warrants an integrated intervention approach. In this study we examined the relevance, acceptability, and feasibility of evaluating a multi-sectoral integrated violence- and mental health-focused intervention (Nguvu).We enrolled 311 Congolese refugee women from Nyarugusu refugee camp in Tanzania with past-year intimate partner violence and elevated psychological distress in a feasibility cluster randomized trial. Women were recruited from local women's groups that were randomized to the Nguvu intervention or usual care. Participants from women's groups randomized to Nguvu received 8 weekly sessions delivered by lay refugee incentive workers. Psychological distress, intimate partner violence, other wellbeing, and process indicators were assessed at baseline and 9-weeks post-enrollment to evaluate relevance, acceptability, and feasibility of implementing and evaluating Nguvu in refugee contexts.We found that Nguvu was relevant to the needs of refugee women affected by intimate partner violence. We found reductions in some indicators of psychological distress, but did not identify sizeable changes in partner violence over time. Overall, we found that Nguvu was acceptable and feasible. However, challenges to the research protocol included baseline imbalances between study conditions, differential intervention completion related to intimate partner violence histories, differences between Nguvu groups and facilitators, and some indication that Nguvu may be less beneficial for participants with more severe intimate partner violence profiles.We found evidence supporting the relevance of Nguvu to refugee women affected by partner violence and psychological distress and moderate evidence supporting the acceptability and feasibility of evaluating and implementing this intervention in a complex refugee setting. A definitive cluster randomized trial requires further adaptations for recruitment and eligibility screening, randomization, and retention.ISRCTN65771265, June 27, 2016."
https://openalex.org/W3172391316,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has created a remarkable and varying impact in every country, inciting calls for broad attention. Recently, the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination has been regarded as a potential candidate to explain this difference. Herein, we hypothesised that the past epidemic of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M . tuberculosis ) may act as a latent explanatory factor for the worldwide differences seen in COVID-19 impact on mortality and incidence. We compared two indicators of past epidemic of M . tuberculosis , specifically, incidence (90 countries in 1990) and mortality (28 countries in 1950), with the mortality and incidence of COVID-19. We determined that an inverse relationship existed between the past epidemic indicators of M . tuberculosis and current COVID-19 impact. The rate ratio of the cumulative COVID-19 mortality per 1 million was 2.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09–6.68) per 1 unit decrease in the incidence rate of tuberculosis (per 100,000 people). The rate ratio of the cumulative COVID-19 incidence per 1 million was 2.07 (95% CI: 1.30–3.30). This association existed even after adjusting for potential confounders (rate of people aged 65 over, diabetes prevalence, the mortality rate from cardiovascular disease, and gross domestic product per capita), leading to an adjusted rate ratio of COVID-19 mortality of 2.44, (95% CI: 1.32–4.52) and a COVID-19 incidence of 1.31 (95% CI: 0.97–1.78). After latent infection, Mycobacterium survives in the human body and may continue to stimulate trained immunity. This study suggests a possible mechanism underlying the region-based variation in the COVID-19 impact."
https://openalex.org/W3166236734,"Evidence-based practice (EBP) is an important factor determining the quality of healthcare. The field of physiotherapy is still limited by indirect access in several countries including the United Arab Emirates (UAE) which creates added pressure to justify the merit in its practitioner's capabilities. This study explores the behavior, attitudes, awareness and knowledge towards EBP among practicing physiotherapists in the UAE. It also enquires about their perception of the barriers in the implementation of EBP. Using a questionnaire survey of 258 physiotherapists, results show that the awareness of EBP is limited to a few terms including EBP, systematic literature review, and random trials while other terms associated with scientific studies are not known well. The attitude towards EBP was found to be significantly related to the knowledge of EBP (r = 0.208) and the perception of barriers to it (r = 0.156). The EBP behavior was found positively related to its knowledge (r = 0.134) and the perception of barriers (r = 0.216). The physiotherapists prefer to use their own experience and books and research articles to apply EBP but do not consider their peers to be as worthy sources as the others. However, their attitudes towards EBP are largely positive though their perception of barriers grows with better knowledge and understanding of EBP. The barriers in the implementation of EBP are a lack of research knowledge and skills, time, support, and resources which indicate opportunities for the decision-makers to improve the adoption of EBP among these professionals. This study concluded that although physiotherapists in the UAE claim awareness about EBP, their knowledge is limited to a few key terms whereas, attention is needed to improve EBP knowledge and practice."
https://openalex.org/W3167410422,"Aging is associated with functional decline in the immune system and increases the risk of chronic diseases owing to smoldering inflammation. In the present study, we demonstrated an age-related increase in the accumulation of Programmed Death-1 (PD-1)+ memory-phenotype T cells that are considered ""senescence-associated T cells"" in both the visceral adipose tissue and spleen. As caloric restriction is an established intervention scientifically proven to exert anti-aging effects and greatly affects physiological and pathophysiological alterations with advanced age, we evaluated the effect of caloric restriction on the increase in this T-cell subpopulation and glucose tolerance in aged mice. Long-term caloric restriction significantly decreased the number of PD-1+ memory-phenotype cluster of differentiation (CD) 4+ and CD8+ T cells in the spleen and visceral adipose tissue, decreased M1-type macrophage accumulation in visceral adipose tissue, and improved insulin resistance in aged mice. Furthermore, the immunological depletion of PD-1+ T cells reduced adipose inflammation and improved insulin resistance in aged mice. Taken together with our previous report, these results indicate that senescence-related T-cell subpopulations are involved in the development of chronic inflammation and insulin resistance in the context of chronological aging and obesity. Thus, long-term caloric restriction and specific deletion of senescence-related T cells are promising interventions to regulate age-related chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3168205975,"The effect of nitrogen fertilizer application on the quality of rice post-storage is not well understood. The eating and cooking quality (ECQ) of rice treated with 0 (CK, control), 160 (IN, insufficient nitrogen), 260 (AN, adequate nitrogen), and 420 (EN, excessive nitrogen) kg N/ha was analyzed over 12 months of storage. Results showed that the rate of nitrogen fertilizer application had no significant impact on the changes in taste value during storage. However, EN application significantly increased the hardness (p < 0.05), reduced the gumminess (p < 0.05), and delayed the decline in the viscosity of rice paste by two months after one-year storage, compared with other treatments. In conclusion, although EN application resulted in an inferior texture of rice, it delayed the quality change by two months during storage. It was demonstrated that a rational nitrogen application rate (0-260 kg N/ha) for rice cultivation is particularly important to obtain high ECQ; however, EN may be beneficial for the stability of the ECQ during storage."
https://openalex.org/W3169835963,"Accurately forecasting the case rate of malaria would enable key decision makers to intervene months before the onset of any outbreak, potentially saving lives. Until now, methods that forecast malaria have involved complicated numerical simulations that model transmission through a community. Here we present the first data-driven malaria epidemic early warning system that can predict the 13-week case rate in a primary health facility in Burkina Faso. Using the extraordinarily high-fidelity data of infant consultations taken from the Integrated e-Diagnostic Approach (IeDA) system that has been rolled out throughout Burkina Faso, we train a combination of Gaussian Processes and Random Forest Regressors to estimate the weekly number of malaria cases over a 13 week period. We test our algorithm on historical epidemics and find that for our lowest threshold for an epidemic alert, our algorithm has 30% precision with > 99% recall at raising an alert. This rises to > 99% precision and 5% recall for the high alert threshold. Our two-tailed predictions have an average 1σ and 2σ precision of 5 cases and 30 cases respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3171374372,"Critical period plasticity at adult-born neuron synapses is widely believed to contribute to the learning and memory functions of the hippocampus. Experience regulates circuit integration and for a transient interval, until cells are ~6 weeks old, new neurons display enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) at afferent and efferent synapses. Since neurogenesis declines substantially with age, this raises questions about the extent of lasting plasticity offered by adult-born neurons. Notably, however, the hippocampus receives sensory information from two major cortical pathways. Broadly speaking, the medial entorhinal cortex conveys spatial information to the hippocampus via the medial perforant path (MPP), and the lateral entorhinal cortex, via the lateral perforant path (LPP), codes for the cues and items that make experiences unique. While enhanced critical period plasticity at MPP synapses is relatively well characterized, no studies have examined long-term plasticity at LPP synapses onto adult-born neurons, even though the lateral entorhinal cortex is uniquely vulnerable to aging and Alzheimer’s pathology. We therefore investigated LTP at LPP inputs both within (4–6 weeks) and beyond (8 + weeks) the traditional critical period. At immature stages, adult-born neurons did not undergo significant LTP at LPP synapses, and often displayed long-term depression after theta burst stimulation. However, over the course of 3–4 months, adult-born neurons displayed increasingly greater amounts of LTP. Analyses of short-term plasticity point towards a presynaptic mechanism, where transmitter release probability declines as cells mature, providing a greater dynamic range for strengthening synapses. Collectively, our findings identify a novel form of new neuron plasticity that develops over an extended interval, and may therefore be relevant for maintaining cognitive function in aging."
https://openalex.org/W3116919839,"Though considerable efforts have been made to improve the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the prognosis of patients has remained poor. Identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in EOC progression and exploiting them as novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets is of great value.Overlapping DEGs were screened out from three independent gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets and were subjected to Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. The protein-protein interactions (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed based on the STRING database. The expression of hub genes was validated in GEPIA and GEO. The relationship of hub genes expression with tumor stage and overall survival and progression-free survival of EOC patients was investigated using the cancer genome atlas data.A total of 306 DEGs were identified, including 265 up-regulated and 41 down-regulated. Through PPI network analysis, the top 20 genes were screened out, among which 4 hub genes, which were not researched in depth so far, were selected after literature retrieval, including CDC45, CDCA5, KIF4A, ESPL1. The four genes were up-regulated in EOC tissues compared with normal tissues, but their expression decreased gradually with the continuous progression of EOC. Survival curves illustrated that patients with a lower level of CDCA5 and ESPL1 had better overall survival and progression-free survival statistically.Two hub genes, CDCA5 and ESPL1, identified as probably playing tumor-promotive roles, have great potential to be utilized as novel therapeutic targets for EOC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3171547573,"Mounting evidence suggests that Lactobacillus species may not necessarily be the sine qua non of healthy cervicovaginal microbiota (CVM), especially among reproductive-age African women. A majority of African women have high-diversity non-Lactobacillus-dominated CVM whose bacterial functions remain poorly characterized. Functional profiling of the CVM is vital for investigating human host-microbiota interactions in health and disease. Here, we investigated the functional potential of L. iners-dominated and high-diversity non-Lactobacillus-dominated CVM of 75 African women with and without bacterial vaginosis (BV) and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection. Functional contents were predicted using PICRUSt. Microbial taxonomic diversity, BV, and HR-HPV infection statuses were correlated with the inferred functional composition of the CVM. Differentially abundant inferred functional categories were identified using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) (p-value <0.05 and logarithmic LDA score >2.0). Of the 75 women, 56 (74.7%), 35 (46.7%), and 29 (38.7%) had high-diversity non-Lactobacillus-dominated CVM, BV, and HR-HPV infection, respectively. Alpha diversity of the inferred functional contents (as measured by Shannon diversity index) was significantly higher in women with high-diversity non-Lactobacillus-dominated CVM and BV than their respective counterparts (H statistic ≥11.5, q-value <0.001). Ordination of the predicted functional metagenome content (using Bray-Curtis distances) showed that the samples segregated according to the extent of microbial taxonomic diversity and BV (pseudo-F statistic ≥19.6, q-value = 0.001) but not HR-HPV status (pseudo-F statistic = 1.7, q-value = 0.159). LEfSe analysis of the inferred functional categories revealed that transport systems (including ABC transporters) and transcription factors were enriched in high-diversity CVM. Interestingly, transcription factors and sporulation functional categories were uniquely associated with high-diversity CVM, BV, and HR-HPV infection. Our predictive functional analysis reveals features unique to high-diversity CVM, BV and HR-HPV infections. Such features may represent important biomarkers of BV and HR-HPV infection. Our findings require proof-of-concept functional studies to examine the relevance of these potential biomarkers in women's reproductive health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3170629395,"Successful eutrophication control strategies need to address the limiting nutrient. We conducted a battery of laboratory and in situ nutrient-limitation tests with waters collected from 9 streams in an agricultural region of the upper Snake River basin, Idaho, USA. Laboratory tests used the green alga Raphidocelis subcapitata, the macrophyte Lemna minor (duckweed) with native epiphytes, and in situ nutrient-limitation tests of periphyton were conducted with nutrient-diffusing substrates (NDS). In the duckweed/epiphyte test, P saturation occurred when concentrations reached about 100 μg/L. Chlorophyll a in epiphytic periphyton was stimulated at low P additions and by about 100 μg/L P, epiphytic periphyton chlorophyll a appeared to be P saturated. Both duckweed and epiphyte response patterns with total N were weaker but suggested a growth stimulation threshold for duckweed when total N concentrations exceeded about 300 μg/L and approached saturation at the highest N concentration tested, 1300 μg/L. Nutrient uptake by epiphytes and macrophytes removed up to 70 and 90% of the N and P, respectively. The green algae and the NDS nutrient-limitation test results were mostly congruent; N and P co-limitation was the most frequent result for both test series. Across all tests, when N:P molar ratios >30 (mass ratios >14), algae or macrophyte growth was P limited; N limitation was observed at N:P molar ratios up to 23 (mass ratios up to 10). A comparison of ambient periphyton chlorophyll a concentrations with chlorophyll a accrued on control artificial substrates in N-limited streams, suggests that total N concentrations associated with a periphyton chlorophyll a benchmark for desirable or undesirable conditions for recreation would be about 600 to 1000 μg/L total N, respectively. For P-limited streams, the corresponding benchmark concentrations were about 50 to 90 μg/L total P, respectively. Our approach of integrating controlled experiments and matched biomonitoring field surveys was cost effective and more informative than either approach alone."
https://openalex.org/W3167460910,"The small heat shock protein (sHsp) called HspB8 (formerly, Hsp22) is one of the least typical sHsp members, whose oligomerization status remains debatable. Here we analyze the effect of mutations in a highly conservative sequence located in the N-terminal domain of human HspB8 on its physico-chemical properties and chaperone-like activity. According to size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering, the wild type (WT) HspB8 is present as dominating monomeric species (~24 kDa) and a small fraction of oligomers (~60 kDa). The R29A amino acid substitution leads to the predominant formation of 60-kDa oligomers, leaving only a small fraction of monomers. Deletion of the 28–32 pentapeptide (Δ mutant) results in the formation of minor quantities of dimers (~49 kDa) and large quantities of the 24-kDa monomers. Both the WT protein and its Δ mutant efficiently bind a hydrophobic probe bis-ANS and are relatively rapidly hydrolyzed by chymotrypsin, whereas the R29A mutant weakly binds bis-ANS and resists chymotrypsinolysis. In contrast to HspB8 WT and its Δ mutant, which are well phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent and ERK1 protein kinases, the R29A mutant is poorly phosphorylated. R29A mutation affects the chaperone-like activity of HspB8 measured in vitro . It is concluded that the irreplaceable Arg residue located in the only highly conservative motif in the N-terminal domain of all sHsp proteins affects the oligomeric structure and key properties of HspB8."
https://openalex.org/W3172858218,"A desirable tester that elicits greater genetic difference in Striga resistance among test crosses in a breeding program has not been reported. Therefore, this study was conducted to characterize 30 Striga resistant yellow endosperm maize inbred lines and three testers with varying resistance levels to Striga using DArTseq SNP markers and agronomic traits to identify a suitable tester for resistance hybrid breeding. Marker-based and agronomic trait-based genetic distances were estimated for yellow endosperm maize inbred lines and testers with varying resistance levels to Striga. The Marker-based cluster analysis separated the Striga resistant lines and testers into two distinct groups. Although the susceptible tester (T3) was the most distantly related to the 30 Striga resistant inbred lines, it exhibited a narrower range in genetic distance estimates and poor agronomic performance under Striga infestation in crosses with the resistant lines. In contrast, the resistant tester (T2) showed a broader range in genetic distance estimates in pairs with the 30 resistant lines. Also, it formed many high yielding hybrids with desirable traits under parasite pressure. Furthermore, the most significant positive association between agronomic trait-based and marker-based distance estimates (r = 0.389, P = 0.01) was observed when T2 has paired with the Striga resistant maize inbred lines. It thus appears that T2 may be used as a suitable tester to determine the breeding value of lines in hybrid maize resistance breeding programs. T2 was the most suitable tester, with a tolerant tester (T1) as an alternative tester to characterize the combining ability of Striga resistant maize inbred lines. This result can also encourage other breeders to investigate testers relative discriminating ability with varying levels of resistance in hybrid breeding for resistance to diseases, pests, and other parasitic plants."
https://openalex.org/W3167346014,"To evaluate the impact of anti-malaria biological larviciding with Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis on non-primary target mosquito species in a rural African setting.A total of 127 villages were distributed in three study arms, each with different larviciding options in public spaces: i) no treatment, ii) full or iii) guided intervention. Geographically close villages were grouped in clusters to avoid contamination between treated and untreated villages. Adult mosquitoes were captured in light traps inside and outside houses during the rainy seasons of a baseline and an intervention year. After enumeration, a negative binomial regression was used to determine the reductions achieved in the different mosquito species through larviciding.Malaria larviciding interventions showed only limited or no impact against Culex mosquitoes; by contrast, reductions of up to 34% were achieved against Aedes when all detected breeding sites were treated. Culex mosquitoes were captured in high abundance in semi-urban settings while more Aedes were found in rural villages.Future malaria larviciding programs should consider expanding onto the breeding habitats of other disease vectors, such as Aedes and Culex and evaluate their potential impact. Since the major cost components of such interventions are labor and transport, other disease vectors could be targeted at little additional cost."
https://openalex.org/W3168143229,"Many studies of MRI radiomics do not include the discretization method used for the analyses, which might indicate that the discretization methods used are considered irrelevant. Our goals were to compare three frequently used discretization methods (lesion relative resampling (LRR), lesion absolute resampling (LAR) and absolute resampling (AR)) applied to the same data set, along with two different lesion segmentation approaches.We analyzed the effects of altering bin widths or bin numbers for the three different sampling methods using 40 texture indices (TIs). The impact was evaluated on brain MRI studies obtained for 71 patients divided into three different disease groups: multiple sclerosis (MS, N = 22), ischemic stroke (IS, N = 22), cancer patients (N = 27). Two different MRI acquisition protocols were considered for all patients, a T2- and a post-contrast 3D T1-weighted MRI sequence. Elliptical and manually drawn VOIs were employed for both imaging series. Three different types of gray-level discretization methods were used: LRR, LAR and AR. Hypothesis tests were done among all diseased and control areas to compare the TI values in these areas. We also did correlation analyses between TI values and lesion volumes.In general, no significant differences were reported in the results when employing the AR and LAR discretization methods. It was found that employing 38 TIs introduced variation in the results when the number of bin parameters was altered, suggesting that both the degree and direction of monotonicity between each TI value and binning parameters were characteristic for each TI. Furthermore, while TIs were changing with altering binning values, no changes correlated to neither disease nor the MRI sequence. We found that most indices correlated weakly with the volume, while the correlation coefficients were independent of both diseases analyzed and MR contrast. Several cooccurrence-matrix based texture parameters show a definite higher correlation when employing the LRR discretization method However, with the best correlations obtained for the manually drawn VOI. Hypothesis tests among all disease and control areas (co-lateral hemisphere) revealed that the AR or LAR discretization techniques provide more suitable texture features than LRR. In addition, the manually drawn segmentation gave fewer significantly different TIs than the ellipsoid segmentations. In addition, the amount of TIs with significant differences was increasing with increasing the number of bins, or decreasing bin widths.Our findings indicate that the AR discretization method may offer the best texture analysis in MR image assessments. Employing too many bins or too large bin widths might reduce the selection of TIs that can be used for differential diagnosis. In general, more statistically different TIs were observed for elliptical segmentations when compared to the manually drawn VOIs. In the texture analysis of MR studies, studies and publications should report on all important parameters and methods related to data collection, corrections, normalization, discretization, and segmentation."
https://openalex.org/W3169656115,"Previous research indicates that social support is beneficial to cancer patients in adjusting to the stress of the disease. Drawing on a qualitative content analysis of 36 semi-structured interviews, this article explores sources and types of social support in Arab-Palestinian women with breast cancer. Results show that members of the immediate family, husbands in particular, are reported to be the most supportive social sources. Given the limitations that characterize access to cancer care in the occupied Palestinian territory (OPT) and the collectivistic values of the society, women with breast cancer seem to rely mainly on their husbands to handle emotional, functional and informational needs. Emotional support includes the provision of care, trust, reassurance, and companionship. Functional support includes the practical assistance that the cancer patients receive in terms of financial support, attendance during treatment or help with domestic chores and childcare. Accessing appropriate informational support can be quite challenging in the OPT since available information is not always reliable. The family plays a key role in mediating communication with doctors. Contact with breast cancer patients and survivors is also a source of supporting information, with however a possible negative impact in terms of emotional coping. In this context, the immediate family becomes a fundamental resource for coping and a relational space that mediates connections with others, including doctors, acting as a ""proxy"" between the patient and the social environment. Findings are discussed in light of the historical and sociocultural context of the OPT."

Two groups were analysed: eyes with no prior history of CXL (Group A) and eyes with prior CXL (Group B). Repeatability of measurements was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV).In Group A, central corneal thickness (CCT) was 472.18 ± 45.41μm, and the ET was found to be the thinnest in the inferior-temporal aspect at 51.79 ± 5.97μm and thickest at the superior-nasal aspect at 56.07 ± 5.70μm. In Group B, CCT was 465.11± 42.28μm, and the ET was the thinnest at the inferior-temporal aspect at 50.63 ± 5.52μm and thickest at the superior aspect at 56.80 ± 6.39μm. When evaluating CT measurements, ICC was above 0.86 and 0.83 for Group A and Group B respectively. When evaluating ET measurements, ICC was above 0.82 for both groups. CXL had no statistically significant impact on the repeatability of measurements.AS-OCT provides repeatable CT and ET measurements in the central and peripheral cornea in patients with keratoconus. Repeatability is not affected by a history of CXL."
https://openalex.org/W3170406807,"The Singapore national Advance Care Planning (ACP) programme was launched in 2011 with the purpose of ensuring that healthcare professionals are fully aware of patients' treatment preferences. There is little research assessing the performance of such programmes in ethnically diverse Asian countries; hence, the purpose of this study was to qualitatively examine patients and caregivers' experiences with the ACP programme.We conducted interviews with 28 participants, thirteen of whom identified as proxy decision makers (PDMs) and the remainder as patients. Interviews focused on respondents' experiences of chronic illness and of participating in the ACP programme. Textual data was analysed through a framework analysis approach.Participants' narratives focused on four major themes with 12 subthemes: a) Engagement with Death, factors influencing respondents' acceptance of ACP; b) Formation of Preferences, the set of concerns influencing respondents' choice of care; c) Choice of PDM, considerations shaping respondents' choice of nominated health spokesperson; and d) Legacy Solidification, how ACP is used to ensure the welfare of the family after the patient passes. These findings led to our development of the directive decision-making process framework, which delineates personal and sociocultural factors influencing participants' decision-making processes. Respondents' continual participation in the intervention were driven by their personal belief system that acted as a lens through which they interpreted religious doctrine and socio-cultural norms according to their particular needs.The directive decision-making process framework indicated that ACP could be appropriate for the Asian context because participants displayed an awareness of the need for ACP and were able to develop a concrete treatment plan. Patients in this study made decisions based on their perceived long-term legacy for their family, who they hoped to provide with a solid financial and psychological foundation after their death."
https://openalex.org/W3171184174,"Influence maximisation, or how to affect the intrinsic opinion dynamics of a social group, is relevant for many applications, such as information campaigns, political competition, or marketing. Previous literature on influence maximisation has mostly explored discrete allocations of influence, i.e. optimally choosing a finite fixed number of nodes to target. Here, we study the generalised problem of continuous influence maximisation where nodes can be targeted with flexible intensity. We focus on optimal influence allocations against a passive opponent and compare the structure of the solutions in the continuous and discrete regimes. We find that, whereas hub allocations play a central role in explaining optimal allocations in the discrete regime, their explanatory power is strongly reduced in the continuous regime. Instead, we find that optimal continuous strategies are very well described by two other patterns: (i) targeting the same nodes as the opponent (shadowing) and (ii) targeting direct neighbours of the opponent (shielding). Finally, we investigate the game-theoretic scenario of two active opponents and show that the unique pure Nash equilibrium is to target all nodes equally. These results expose fundamental differences in the solutions to discrete and continuous regimes and provide novel effective heuristics for continuous influence maximisation."
https://openalex.org/W3171438697,"The aim was to estimate genetic parameters for milk urea (MU) concentration and its relationship with milk yield and compositions in Holstein dairy Cows. Edited data were 90,594 test-day records of milk yield and composition collected during 2015 to 2018 on 13,737 lactations obtained from 7,850 Holstein cows in 50 herds. Random regression test-day model was used to estimate genetic parameters. (Co)variance components were estimated with the Bayesian Gibbs sampling method using a single chain of 400,000 iterates. The first 50,000 iterates of each chain were regarded as a burn-in period. Mean (SD) of MU was 23.03 (5.99) and 22.41 (5.74) mg/dl in primiparous and multiparous cows, respectively. Average heritability estimates for daily MU was 0.33 (SD = 0.02) ranged 0.29 to 0.36 and 0.32 (SD = 0.03) ranged 0.27 to 0.34, respectively, for primiparous and multiparous cows. The mean (SD) genetic correlation between MU and milk yield, fat yield, protein yield, lactose yield, fat percentage, protein percentage, lactose percentage, and somatic cell score was, respectively, -0.02 (0.03), -0.02 (0.01), 0.01 (0.04), 0.01 (0.03), 0.00 (0.07), -0.03 (0.04), 0.00 (0.01), -0.11 (0.06) in primiparous cows. The corresponding values in multiparous cows were -0.01 (0.02), -0.01 (0.03), -0.04 (0.04), -0.04 (0.04), 0.04 (0.04), 0.04 (0.07), -0.03 (0.09), 0.06 (0.11), respectively. The results indicate that selection on MU is possible with no effect on milk yield or compositions, however, relationships between MU and other important traits such as longevity, metabolic diseases, and fertility are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3167520911,"The Upper Quarter Y Balance test (YBT-UQ) is a field test for measuring shoulder mobility/stability. However, there is a lack of information regarding age- and sex-specific reference values for classifying the YBT-UQ performance of children and adolescents.The aim was to investigate YBT-UQ performance in youth and to provide age- and sex-specific normative values.Six hundred and sixty-five persons (325 girls, 340 boys) aged between 10 and 17 years carried out the YBT-UQ test. Following this, maximum reach values, normalised in terms of arm length, were calculated for each arm (i.e., left and right) and reach direction (i.e., medial [MD], inferolateral [IL], superolateral [SL]), and the composite score (CS) per arm. Additionally, percentiles were displayed graphically and in tabular form, distinguished according to age and gender.In boys, those aged 14-15 years showed a higher achievement (e.g., MD direction) compared with both younger (12-13-year-olds) and older (16-17-year-olds) persons. In girls, differences related to age could only be observed for the IL direction and the CS, where the youngest age group (10-11-year-olds) achieved better results than the older groups. Sex-specific differences to the girls' advantage could be observed in 12-13-year-olds (i.e., SL and CS), and to the boys' advantage in 14-15-year-olds (i.e., for all reach directions) and 16-17-year-olds (i.e., IL and SL direction and CS). Further, curvilinear developments were observed with regard to the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles, and were more strongly marked in boys than in girls.The obtained age- and sex-specific normative values for the YBT-UQ can be used by teachers, coaches, and therapists to classify the level of shoulder mobility/stability among 10-17 year-old children and adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3167775471,"Recently it has been show that in some ecosystems fast rates of change of environmental drivers may trigger a critical transition, whereas change of the same magnitude but at slower rates would not. So far, few studies describe this phenomenon of rate-induced tipping, while it is important to understand this phenomenon in the light of the ongoing rapid environmental change. Here, we demonstrate rate-induced tipping in a simple model of cyanobacteria with realistic parameter settings. We explain graphically that there is a range of initial conditions at which a gradual increase in environmental conditions can cause a collapse of the population, but only if the change is fast enough. In addition, we show that a pulse in the environmental conditions can cause a temporary collapse, but that is dependent on both the rate and the duration of the pulse. Furthermore, we study whether the autocorrelation of stochastic environmental conditions can influence the probability of inducing rate-tipping. As both the rate of environmental change, and autocorrelation of the environmental variability are increasing in parts of the climate, the probability for rate-induced tipping to occur is likely to increase. Our results imply that, even though the identification of rate sensitive ecosystems in the real world will be challenging, we should incorporate critical rates of change in our ecosystem assessments and management."

It used a retrospective chart review and questionnaire survey obtained from 560 patients (266 men and 294 women). It also conducted follow-up observations of progress after car insurance settlements and investigated the usefulness of and patient satisfaction with integrative Korean medicine treatment for traffic accident injuries. Retrospective data of patients admitted for traffic accident injury were obtained. A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data regarding the degree of traffic accident damage, severity of pain at settlement, any treatment after settlement and duration and cost of such treatment, and patient satisfaction with car insurance services and Korean medicine treatment for traffic accident injury. The results showed no significant association between pain and the degree of damage to the car at the time of traffic accident (P = 0.662), although the degree of damage to the car was more significantly associated with time to reach a car insurance settlement than severity of pain in the patient (P = 0.003). There was no significant association between the degree of damage to the car in a traffic accident and pain after a traffic accident. Greater severity of pain at the time of the car insurance settlement was associated with greater cost and longer time spent in treatment after the car insurance settlement."

Even though, some researches have been done on day time students, there is no study conducted focusing on young girls attending night school in Ethiopia.This study aimed to assess young-parent communication on sexual and reproductive health issues and associated factors among night female students in Amhara Region, Ethiopia, 2018.School based quantitative cross-sectional study was employed in Amhara region among 1640 young female night students from September 15 to November 15/2018. Face-to-face interview-administered questionnaires were used to collect the data. Bi-variable and multi-variable logistic regression model were used. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed to determine the strength of association between predictor and outcome variables. P-values less than 0.05 considered as level of significance.One hundred ten (37.5%) of the students had communication with their parents on at least two issues of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues in the last 6 months.

https://openalex.org/W3168546623,"Long-term predictions of forest dynamics, including forecasts of tree growth and mortality, are central to sustainable forest-management planning. Although often difficult to evaluate, tree mortality rates under different abiotic and biotic conditions are vital in defining the long-term dynamics of forest ecosystems. In this study, we have modeled tree mortality rates using conditional inference trees (CTREE) and multi-year permanent sample plot data sourced from an inventory with coverage of New Brunswick (NB), Canada. The final CTREE mortality model was based on four tree- and three stand-level terms together with two climatic terms. The correlation coefficient (R 2 ) between observed and predicted mortality rates was 0.67. High cumulative annual growing degree-days (GDD) was found to lead to increased mortality in 18 tree species, including Betula papyrifera , Picea mariana , Acer saccharum , and Larix laricina . In another ten species, including Abies balsamea , Tsuga canadensis , Fraxinus americana , and Fagus grandifolia , mortality rates tended to be higher in areas with high incident solar radiation. High amounts of precipitation in NB’s humid maritime climate were also found to contribute to heightened tree mortality. The relationship between high GDD, solar radiation, and high mortality rates was particularly strong when precipitation was also low. This would suggest that although excessive soil water can contribute to heightened tree mortality by reducing the supply of air to the roots, occasional drought in NB can also contribute to increased mortality events. These results would have significant implications when considered alongside regional climate projections which generally entail both components of warming and increased precipitation."

Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are a key intervention used to prevent malaria transmission, but insufficient ITN availability and low use can hinder effectiveness. This study assessed age and sex disparities in ITN possession, access, and use among household members of ethnic minority and internally displaced populations in eastern Myanmar. Cross-sectional data from the 2013 Eastern Burma Retrospective Mortality Survey were used to describe prevalence of ITN possession, access, and use. The association between a household member's biological sex and their ITN use was assessed using multilevel log binomial regression. Age and household ITN supply were tested as potential effect modifiers. Of 37927 household members, 89.8% (95% CI: 89.5, 90.1) of people lived in households with at least one ITN. Approximately half belonged to households with sufficient ITN supply and used an ITN. Pregnant women and children under five had the highest proportion of ITN use regardless of sufficient household ITN status. Female adults aged 15 to 49 years old (Risk ratio or RR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.29, 1.52) were more likely to use ITNs. This relationship did not differ by sufficient household ITN status. The findings suggest that among ethnic minority populations in areas where ITN use is indicated, many households do not have adequate ITN supply, and many individuals are not using ITNs. Children under five and pregnant women appear to be prioritized for ITN use and overall, women are slightly more likely to use ITNs than men. This study's findings can support efforts ensuring that all household members belonging to ethnic minority and displaced populations in Eastern Myanmar benefit from sufficient ITN access and use for malaria prevention."

Herewith, we provide highlights of the synthesis, physical measurements, structural characterization of the newly developed Cu(II) chelates of Schiff Bases, Cu(Picolinyl-L-Tryptopahanate)2, Cu(Picolinyl-L-Tyrosinate)2, Cu(Isonicotinyl-L-Tyrosinate)2, Cu(Picolinyl-L-Phenylalaninate)2, Cu(Nicotinyl-L-Phenylalaninate)2, Cu(Isonicotinyl-L-Phenylalaninate)2, and their radioenhancement capacity at kV and MV ranges of irradiation of human lung carcinoma epithelial cells in vitro. The methods of cell growth, viability and proliferation were used. All compounds exerted very potent radioenhancer capacities in the irradiated lung carcinoma cells at both kV and MV ranges in a 100 μM concentration. At a concentration of 10 μM, only Cu(Picolinyl-L-Tyrosinate)2, Cu(Isonicotinyl-L-Tyrosinate)2, Cu(Picolinyl-L-Phenylalaninate)2 possessed radioenhancer properties at kV and MV ranges. Cu(Picolinyl-L-Tryptophanate)2 showed radioenhancer properties only at kV range. Cu(Nicotinyl-L-Phenylalaninate)2 and Cu(Isonicotinyl-L-Phenylalaninate)2 showed remarkable radioenhancer activity only at MV range. All compounds acted in dose-dependent manner at both tested energy ranges. These copper (II) compounds, in combination with 1 Gy irradiation at either 120 kV or 6 MV, are more efficient at delaying cell growth of lung cancer cells and at reducing cell viability in vitro than the irradiation administered alone. Thus, we have demonstrated that the studied copper compounds have a good potential for radioenhancement."
https://openalex.org/W3170965362,"Symptoms of subclinical hypomania (SHM) are common in the general population of adolescents and young adults. SHM are most often transient yet might be risk markers of later bipolar disorder. The current study aimed to assess the clinical correlates of SHM at age 11 in the general population, examine the continuity of SHM from age 11-age 16 and explore the clinical precursors of age 16 SHM. As part of the Copenhagen Child Cohort 2000, 1,632 preadolescents participated in the examination of SHM and various clinical correlates at age 11, 893 were re-assessed for SHM at age 16 years. At age 11, SHM, psychotic experiences and depressive symptoms were assessed by semi-structured psychopathological interviews. Furthermore, the participants were diagnostically assessed by the Development and Well-Being Assessment and interviewed about sleep length. At age 16, SHM was assessed by self-report, using the Hypomania Checklist-32. Cannabis use occurring at age 15 or earlier was assessed at age 16. At age 11, SHM was associated with depressive disorders (Relative Risk [RR] = 2.96 [95% CI 1.26-6.96]), interview-based depressive symptoms (RR = 9.22 [5.93-14.34]), neurodevelopmental disorders (RR = 2.94 [1.66-5.20]), psychotic experiences (RR = 4.51 [2.90-7.01]) and insufficient sleep (RR = 2.10 [1.28-3.43]. In the longitudinal analyses, age 16 SHM was preceded by age 11 SHM (RR = 1.89 [1.02-3.49]), psychotic experiences (RR = 2.06, [1.28-3.33]), emotional disorders (RR = 1.77, [1.02-3.09]) and cannabis use (RR = 3.14, [1.93-5.10]), after mutual adjustment and adjustment for sex, and sociodemographic factors. In conclusion, age 11 SHM was statistically significantly associated with other types of psychopathology in cross-sectional analyses and showed some continuity with later self-reported SHM at age 16. Particularly early psychotic experiences and cannabis use stood out as independent precursors of self-reported SHM and might constitute important risk markers for the development of future SHM and bipolar disorder. An important potential caveat of the current study includes the self-report assessment of SHM."

Around twenty bloodborne pathogens are known to be transmitted through these occupational injuries. This problem alters the health status of health care professionals in different ways, including physically, mentally, and psychologically. Even though health professionals especially midwives who are working in delivery rooms are highly affected, little is known about the exposure. So, this study was aimed to assess the prevalence of exposure to blood/body fluid splash and its predictors among midwives working in public health institutions of Addis Ababa city.Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted among 438 study participants in public health institutions in Addis Ababa. Data was collected from March 1-20, 2020 by a self-administered questionnaire. The data were entered into Epi data version 3.1 and then exported to SPSS version 24 for analysis. All variables with P<0.25 in the bivariate analysis were included in a final model and statistical significance was declared at P< 0.05.In this study, a total of 424 respondents respond yielding a response rate of 97%. The prevalence of blood and body fluid splashes (BBFs) was 198 (46.7%). Not training on infection prevention, working in two shifts (> 12 hours), not regularly apply universal precautions, job-related stress, an average monthly salary of 5001-8000 were independent predictors of blood and body fluid splashes.The study revealed that nearly half of midwives were exposed to BBFS. This highlights the need for key stakeholders such as policymakers and service providers to design appropriate policies to avert this magnitude and making the environment enabling to comply with standard precautions. We recommend that this study may be done by including rural setting institutions and by including other health professionals that are susceptible to BBFS at work. Formal training on infection prevention and safety practice to apply universal precautions will be needed from the concerned bodies to prevent exposures to blood/body fluid splash."

By collecting the daily data of industry index (2005-2020) and region index (2012-2020) listed in China as samples, this paper applies an innovative measure named partial mutual information on mixed embedding to generate directed networks. Based on the analysis of nonlinear relationships among sectors, this paper realizes the accurate construction of ""time-varying"" financial network from the perspective of risk spillover. The results are presented as follow: (1) interactions can be better understood through the nonlinear networks among distinct sectors, and sectors in the networks could be classified into different types according to their topological properties connected to risk spillover; (2) in the rising stage, information is transmitted rapidly in the network, so the risk is fast diffused and absorbed; (3) in the declining stage, the network topology is more complex and panic sentiments have long term impact leading to more connections; (4) The US market, Japan market and Hongkong market have significant affect on China's market. The results suggest that this nonlinear measure is an effective approach to develop financial networks and explore the mechanism of risk spillover."
https://openalex.org/W3167078692,"This study examined involuntary capture of attention, overt attention, and stimulus valence and arousal ratings, all factors that can contribute to potential attentional biases to face and train objects in children with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In the visual domain, faces are particularly captivating, and are thought to have a ‘special status’ in the attentional system. Research suggests that similar attentional biases may exist for other objects of expertise (e.g. birds for bird experts), providing support for the role of exposure in attention prioritization. Autistic individuals often have circumscribed interests around certain classes of objects, such as trains, that are related to vehicles and mechanical systems. This research aimed to determine whether this propensity in autistic individuals leads to stronger attention capture by trains, and perhaps weaker attention capture by faces, than what would be expected in non-autistic children. In Experiment 1, autistic children (6–14 years old) and age- and IQ-matched non-autistic children performed a visual search task where they manually indicated whether a target butterfly appeared amongst an array of face, train, and neutral distractors while their eye-movements were tracked. Autistic children were no less susceptible to attention capture by faces than non-autistic children. Overall, for both groups, trains captured attention more strongly than face stimuli and, trains had a larger effect on overt attention to the target stimuli, relative to face distractors. In Experiment 2, a new group of children (autistic and non-autistic) rated train stimuli as more interesting and exciting than the face stimuli, with no differences between groups. These results suggest that: (1) other objects (trains) can capture attention in a similar manner as faces, in both autistic and non-autistic children (2) attention capture is driven partly by voluntary attentional processes related to personal interest or affective responses to the stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W3167235798,"Previous research indicates that patient self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) is a cost-effective strategy for improving hypertension (HTN) diagnosis and control. However, it is unknown which specific uses of SMBP produce the most value. Our goal is to estimate, from an insurance perspective, the return-on-investment (ROI) and net present value associated with coverage of SMBP devices when used (a) only to diagnose HTN, (b) only to select and titrate medication, (c) only to monitor HTN treatment, or (d) as a bundle with all three uses combined. We employed national sample of claims data, Framingham risk predictions, and published sensitivity-specificity values of SMBP and clinic blood-pressure measurement to extend a previously-developed local decision-analytic simulation model. We then used the extended model to determine which uses of SMBP produce the most economic value when scaled to the U.S. adult population. We found that coverage of SMBP devices yielded positive ROIs for insurers in the short-run and at lifetime horizon when the three uses of SMBP were considered together. When each use was evaluated separately, positive returns were seen when SMBP was used for diagnosis or for medication selection and titration. However, returns were negative when SMBP was used exclusively to monitor HTN treatment. When scaled to the U.S. population, adoption of SMBP would prevent nearly 16.5 million false positive HTN diagnoses, thereby improving quality of care while saving insurance plans $254 per member. A strong economic case exists for insurers to cover the cost of SMBP devices, but it matters how devices are used."

Iron deficiency was defined as CHr < 32.0 pg. Cutoff values of s-ft and TSAT were determined using receiver operating characteristic curves for the endpoint CHr ≥ 32.0 pg. Logistic analysis was performed with the reference group having s-ft or TSAT below the corresponding cutoff value (low vs high).With the endpoint CHr ≥ 32.0 pg on Day 0, cutoff values for s-ft and TSAT were respectively 49.7 ng/mL and 21.6% on Day 0 and 35.5 ng/mL and 16.2% on Day 28. With the endpoint CHr ≥ 32.0 pg on Day 28, cutoff values for s-ft and TSAT on Day 0 were 81.6 ng/mL and 23.9%, respectively. According to multivariable logistic analysis, the odds ratios of CHr ≥ 32.0 pg on Day 0 were significantly higher for high TSAT on Day 0 [34.7 (95% CI 2.42-131.0), p<0.003] and Day 28 [24.8 (95% CI 2.75-224.0), p = 0.004]. There were no significant differences by s-ft. Odd ratios of CHr ≥ 32.0 pg on Day 28 were also significantly higher for high s-ft on Day 0 [16.0 (95% CI 1.57-163.0), p = 0.019] and high TSAT on Day 0 [13.5 (95% CI 1.24-147.0), p<0.033].Our results suggest Hb synthesis was maintained with lower TSAT and s-ft during Rox therapy compared with DA therapy. To avoid iron deficiency during the 4 weeks after switching DA to Rox, ideal s-ft and TSAT levels before the switch are 81.6 ng/mL and 23.9%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3167807828,"Based on the missing situation and actual needs of maritime search and rescue data, multiple imputation methods were used to construct complete data sets under different missing patterns. Probability density curves and overimputation diagnostics were used to explore the effects of multiple imputation. The results showed that the Data Augmentation (DA) algorithm had the characteristics of high operation efficiency and good imputation effect, but the algorithm was not suitable for data imputation when there was a high data missing rate. The EMB algorithm effectively restored the distribution of datasets with different data missing rates, and was less affected by the missing position; the EMB algorithm could obtain a good imputation effect even when there was a high data missing rate. Overimputation diagnostics could not only reflect the data imputation effect, but also show the correlation between different datasets, which was of great importance for deep data mining and imputation effect improvement. The Expectation-Maximization with Bootstrap (EMB) algorithm had a poor estimation effect on extreme data and failed to reflect the dataset's variability characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3169818781,"Aims Insulin resistance associates with development of metabolic syndrome and risk of cardiovascular disease. The link between insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease is complex and multifactorial. Confirming the genetic link between insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease, as well as the extent of coronary artery disease, is important and may provide better risk stratification for patients at risk. We investigated whether a genetic risk score of 53 single nucleotide polymorphisms known to be associated with insulin resistance phenotypes was associated with diabetes and burden of coronary artery disease. Methods and results We genotyped patients with a coronary angiography performed in the capital region of Denmark from 2010–2014 and constructed a genetic risk score of the 53 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Logistic regression using quartiles of the genetic risk score was performed to determine associations with diabetes and coronary artery disease. Associations with the extent of coronary artery disease, defined as one-, two- or three-vessel coronary artery disease, was determined by multinomial logistic regression. We identified 4,963 patients, of which 17% had diabetes and 55% had significant coronary artery disease. Of the latter, 27%, 14% and 14% had one, two or three-vessel coronary artery disease, respectively. No significant increased risk of diabetes was identified comparing the highest genetic risk score quartile with the lowest. An increased risk of coronary artery disease was found for patients with the highest genetic risk score quartile in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses, OR 1.21 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.42, p = 0.02) and 1.25 (95% CI 1.06, 1.48, p&lt;0.01), respectively. In the adjusted multinomial logistic regression, patients in the highest genetic risk score quartile were more likely to develop three-vessel coronary artery disease compared with patients in the lowest genetic risk score quartile, OR 1.41 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.82, p&lt;0.01). Conclusions Among patients referred for coronary angiography, only a strong genetic predisposition to insulin resistance was associated with risk of coronary artery disease and with a greater disease burden."
https://openalex.org/W3169898760,"Film clips are established to induce or intensify mood states in young persons. Fewer studies address induction of mood states in old persons. Analysis of facial expression provides an opportunity to substantiate subjective mood states with a psychophysiological variable. We investigated healthy young (YA; n = 29; age 24.4 ± 2.3) and old (OA; n = 28; age 69.2 ± 7.4) participants. Subjects were exposed to film segments validated in young adults to induce four basic emotions (anger, disgust, happiness, sadness). We analyzed subjective mood states with a 7-step Likert scale and facial expressions with an automated system for analysis of facial expressions (FaceReader ™ 7.0, Noldus Information Technology b.v.) for both the four target emotions as well as concomitant emotions. Mood expressivity was analysed with the Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire (BEQ) and the Short Suggestibility Scale (SSS). Subjective mood intensified in all target emotions in the whole group and both YA and OA subgroups. Facial expressions of mood intensified in the whole group for all target emotions except sadness. Induction of happiness was associated with a decrease of sadness in both subjective and objective assessment. Induction of sadness was observed with subjective assessment and accompanied by a decrease of happiness in both subjective and objective assessment. Regression analysis demonstrated pre-exposure facial expressions and personality factors (BEQ, SSS) to be associated with the intensity of facial expression on mood induction. We conclude that mood induction is successful regardless of age. Analysis of facial expressions complement self-assessment of mood and may serve as a means of objectification of mood change. The concordance between self-assessment of mood change and facial expression is modulated by personality factors."
https://openalex.org/W3172330255,"Polytrauma and traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients are among the most vulnerable patients in trauma care and exhibit increased morbidity and mortality. Timely care is essential for their outcome. Severe TBI with initially high scores on the Glasgow Coma (GCS) scores is difficult to recognise on scene and referral to a Major Trauma Center (MTC) might be delayed. Therefore, we examined current referral practice, injury patterns and mortality in these patients.Retrospective, nationwide cohort study with Swiss Trauma Register (STR) data between 01/012015 and 31/12/2018. STR includes patients ≥16 years with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) >15 and/or an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) for head >2. We performed Cox proportional hazard models with injury type as the primary outcome and mortality as the dependent variable. Secondary outcomes were inter-hospital transfer and age.9,595 patients were included. Mortality was 12%. 2,800 patients suffered from isolated TBI. 69% were men. Median age was 61 years and median ISS 21. Two thirds of TBI patients had a GCS of 13-15 on admission to the Emergency Department (ED). 26% of patients were secondarily transferred to an MTC. Patients with isolated TBI and those aged ≥65 years were transferred more often. Crude analysis showed a significantly elevated hazard for death of 1.48 (95%CI 1.28-1.70) for polytrauma patients with severe TBI and a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.82 (95%CI 1.58-2.09) for isolated severe TBI, compared to polytrauma patients without TBI. Patients directly admitted to the MTC had a significantly elevated HR for death of 1.63 (95%CI 1.40-1.89), compared to those with secondary transfer.A high initial GCS does not exclude the presence of severe TBI and triage to an MTC should be seriously considered for elderly TBI patients."
https://openalex.org/W3113126650,"Body surface area (BSA) is an important trait used for many clinical purposes. People's BSA may vary due to genetic background, race, and different lifestyle factors (such as walking, exercise, reading, smoking, transportation, etc.). GWAS of BSA was conducted on 5,324 subjects of four ethnic populations of European-American, African-American, Hispanic-American, and Chinese-American from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherocloris (MESA) data using unconditional and conditional full genetic models. In this study, fifteen SNPs were identified (Experiment-wise PEW < 1×10-5) using unconditional full genetic model, of which thirteen SNPs had individual genetic effects and seven SNPs were involved in four pairs of epistasis interactions. Seven single SNPs and eight pairs of epistasis SNPs were additionally identified using exercise, smoking, and transportation cofactor-conditional models. By comparing association analysis results from unconditional and cofactor conditional models, we observed three different scenarios: (i) genetic effects of several SNPs did not affected by cofactors, e.g., additive effect of gene CREB5 (a≙ -0.013 for T/T and 0.013 for G/G, -Log10 PEW = 8.240) did not change in the cofactor models; (ii) genetic effects of several SNPs affected by cofactors, e.g., the genetic additive effect (a≙ 0.012 for A/A and -0.012 for G/G, -Log10 PEW = 7.185) of SNP of the gene GRIN2A was not significant in transportation cofactor model; and (iii) genetic effects of several SNPs suppressed by cofactors, e.g., additive (a≙ -0.018 for G/G and 0.018 for C/C, -Log10 PEW = 19.737) and dominance (d≙ -0.038 for G/C, -Log10 PEW = 27.734) effects of SNP of gene ERBB4 was identified using only transportation cofactor model. Gene ontology analysis showed that several genes are related to the metabolic pathway of calcium compounds, coronary artery disease, type-2 Diabetes, Alzheimer disease, childhood obesity, sleeping duration, Parkinson disease, and cancer. This study revealed that lifestyle cofactors could contribute, suppress, increase or decrease the genetic effects of BSA associated genes."
https://openalex.org/W3167063238,Statistical image analysis of an ensemble of digital images of histological samples is performed as an auxiliary investigation a result of the recently proposed method of articular cartilage repair utilizing growth plate chondrocytes in a skeleton animal model. A fixed-shift model of maximal likelihood estimates of image histograms applied for monochromatic (grayscale) images or their RGB components confirms the statistically significant effect of the previously proposed medical treatment. The type of staining used to prepare images of histological samples is related to the visibility of the effectiveness of medical treatment. Hellinger distance of escort distributions for maximal likelihood estimates of image histograms of medically treated and control samples is investigated to identify grayscale (or RGB) intensities responsible for statistically significant difference of the estimates. A difference of Shannon entropy quantifying informational content of the histograms allows one to identify staining and image colors which are most suitable to visualize cluster formation typical for articular cartilage repair processes.
https://openalex.org/W3171809687,"Mucosal damage, barrier breach, inflammation, and iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) typify ulcerative colitis (UC) in humans. The anemia in UC appears to mainly relate to systemic inflammation. The pathogenesis of this 'anemia of inflammation' (AI) involves cytokine-mediated transactivation of hepatic Hamp (encoding the iron-regulatory hormone, hepcidin). In AI, high hepcidin represses iron absorption (and iron release from stores), thus lowering serum iron, and restricting iron for erythropoiesis (causing anemia). In less-severe disease states, inflammation may be limited to the intestine, but whether this perturbs iron homeostasis is uncertain. We hypothesized that localized gut inflammation will increase overall iron demand (to support the immune response and tissue repair), and that hepatic Hamp expression will decrease in response, thus derepressing (i.e., enhancing) iron absorption. Accordingly, we developed a rat model of mild, acute colitis, and studied iron absorption and homeostasis. Rats exposed (orally) to DSS (4%) for 7 days had intestinal (but not systemic) inflammation, and biomarker analyses demonstrated that iron utilization was elevated. Iron absorption was enhanced (by 2-3-fold) in DSS-treated, WT rats of both sexes, but unexpectedly, hepatic Hamp expression was not suppressed. Therefore, to gain a better understanding of regulation of iron absorption during acute colitis, Hamp KO rats were used for further experimentation. The severity of DSS-colitis was similar in Hamp KOs as in WT controls. In the KOs, increased iron requirements associated with the physiological response to colitis were satisfied by mobilizing hepatic storage iron, rather than by increasing absorption of enteral iron (as occurred in WT rats). In conclusion then, in both sexes and genotypes of rats, iron absorption was appropriately modulated to match physiological demand for dietary iron during acute intestinal inflammation, but regulatory mechanisms may not involve hepcidin."
