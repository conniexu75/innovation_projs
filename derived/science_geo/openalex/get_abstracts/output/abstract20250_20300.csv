https://openalex.org/W1530102523,"The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is localized to specific subcellular environments through binding of the dimeric regulatory subunit (RII) to anchoring proteins. Subcellular localization is likely to influence which substrates are most accessible to the catalytic subunit upon activation. We have previously shown that the RII-binding domains of four anchoring proteins contain sequences which exhibit a high probability of amphipathic helix formation (Carr, D. W., Stofko-Hahn, R. E., Fraser, I. D. C., Bishop, S. M., Acott, T. E., Brennan, R. G., and Scott J. D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 14188-14192). In the present study we describe the cloning of a cDNA which encodes a 1015-amino acid segment of Ht 31. A synthetic peptide (Asp-Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile-Glu-Gln-Val -Lys-Ala-Ala-Tyr) representing residues 493-515 encompasses the minimum region of Ht 31 required for RII binding and blocks anchoring protein interaction with RII as detected by band-shift analysis. Structural analysis by circular dichroism suggests that this peptide can adopt an alpha-helical conformation. Both Ht 31 (493-515) peptide and its parent protein bind RII alpha or the type II PKA holoenzyme with high affinity. Equilibrium dialysis was used to calculate dissociation constants of 4.0 and 3.8 nM for Ht 31 peptide interaction with RII alpha and the type II PKA, respectively. A survey of nine different bovine tissues was conducted to identify RII binding proteins. Several bands were detected in each tissues using a 32P-RII overlay method. Addition of 0.4 microM Ht 31 (493-515) peptide to the reaction mixture blocked all RII binding. These data suggest that all anchoring proteins bind RII alpha at the same site as the Ht 31 peptide. The nanomolar affinity constant and the different patterns of RII-anchoring proteins in each tissue suggest that the type II alpha PKA holoenzyme may be specifically targeted to different locations in each type of cell."
https://openalex.org/W1525041374,"A novel adenylylcyclase cDNA (type V) was isolated from a canine heart cDNA library. Northern blotting indicates that the expression of this message is most abundant in heart with a lesser amount in brain but is absent in a variety of other tissues including lung, kidney, skeletal muscle, lymphocyte, and testis. The putative protein product predicted from the cDNA sequence has the motif of tandem six-transmembrane spans separated by a large hydrophilic cytoplasmic loop as seen in other members of the adenylylcyclase family. When this protein is expressed using a CMT cell transient expression system, the adenylylcyclase activity was stimulated by NaF, GTP gamma S, and forskolin, but not by calmodulin. The activity was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner with either P-site active agents such as adenosine or in the presence of calcium. These data indicate that the protein encoded by this cDNA is adenylylcyclase with the biochemical features characteristic of the cardiac isoform."
https://openalex.org/W1558753212,"A novel trypsin-like protease associated with rat bronchiolar epithelial Clara cells, named Tryptase Clara, was purified to homogeneity from rat lung by a series of standard chromatographic procedures. The enzyme has apparent molecular masses of 180 +/- 16 kDa on gel filtration and 30 +/- 1.5 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Its isoelectric point is pH 4.75. Studies with model peptide substrates showed that the enzyme preferentially recognizes a single arginine cleavage site, cleaving Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide most efficiently and having a pH optimum of 7.5 with this substrate. The enzyme is strongly inhibited by aprotinin, diisopropylfluorophosphate, antipain, leupeptin, and Kunitz-type soybean trypsin inhibitor, but inhibited only slightly by Bowman-Birk soybean trypsin inhibitor, benzamidine, and alpha 1-antitrypsin. Immunohistochemical studies indicated that the enzyme is located exclusively in the bronchiolar epithelial Clara cells and colocalized with surfactant. An immunoreactive protein with a molecular mass of 28.5 kDa was also detected in airway secretions by Western blotting analyses, suggesting that the 30-kDa protease in Clara cells is processed before or after its secretion. Proteolytic cleavage of the hemagglutinin of influenza virus is a prerequisite for the virus to become infectious. Tryptase Clara was shown to cleave the hemagglutinin and activate infectivity of influenza A virus in a dose-dependent way. These results suggest that the enzyme is a possible activator of inactive viral fusion glycoprotein in the respiratory tract and thus responsible for pneumopathogenicity of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W1548138662,"A novel protein kinase which phosphorylates a synthetic peptide substrate (RRPDAHRTPNRAF) has been purified approximately 200,000-fold from bovine brain. This peptide contains the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by the p34cdc2 kinase. The purification procedure took advantage of the phenomenon that this novel brain kinase, in partially purified extracts, chromatographed on a gel filtration column as a high molecular weight complex which dissociated in buffer containing 1 M NaCl. The purified native enzyme was estimated to be approximately 63,000, and displayed two bands of M(r) = 33,000 and 25,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. On Western immunoblot, the M(r) = 33,000 peptide reacted strongly with antibodies specific for a conserved amino-terminal sequence, weakly with antibodies to the conserved PSTAIRE sequence, and not at all with antibodies to the carboxyl terminus, of HeLa cell p34cdc2. The brain kinase and p34cdc2 were similar in displaying good activity toward the parent peptide substrate, but no activity toward peptide analogues in which the -T-P- motif was substituted with either -T-G- or -T-A-. Both kinases showed marked preference in phosphorylating a peptide derived from H1 histone (KTPKKAKKPKTPKKAKKL), and both kinases could be phosphorylated by the src-family tyrosine kinase, p56lyn, purified from bovine spleen. However, the brain kinase did not co-purify with a subunit having a molecular weight corresponding to known cyclins, nor did it undergo specific interaction with p13suc1 beads, suggesting that this enzyme is distinct from p34cdc2."
https://openalex.org/W1523909433,"We have previously demonstrated the ability of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) to down-regulate the expression of GLUT4 (insulin-responsive glucose transporter) and C/EBP-alpha (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein) (Stephens J. M., and Pekala, P. H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21839-21845). As C/EBP-alpha has been suggested to control GLUT4 expression, we have examined the time course for attenuation of transcription of these genes. Run-on transcription assays indicate a coordinate transcriptional repression of both GLUT4 and C/EBP-alpha genes (as well as the 422/aP2 gene, the adipocyte lipid-binding protein, whose expression has also been proposed to be controlled by C/EBP-alpha). Inhibition of transcription was observed within 1 h of TNF addition, with maximal suppression observed after 4 h. The inhibition was not blocked by cycloheximide. Okadaic acid treatment (1 h, 0.5 microM) also resulted in the coordinate transcriptional repression of the C/EBP-alpha, GLUT4, and 422/aP2 genes, consistent with involvement of a kinase-phosphatase system in the regulation of these genes. The decrease in C/EBP-alpha protein content was detectable 4 h after TNF addition and declined to 25% of controls within 24 h. A minor decrease in the protein content of GLUT4 was observed during the first 24 h of exposure to TNF; however, after 72 h of exposure GLUT4 protein was not detectable. The rapid coordinate transcriptional regulation of C/EBP-alpha, GLUT4, and 422/aP2 by TNF in the presence of cycloheximide suggests that the TNF-induced loss of GLUT4 protein may be mediated by a post-translational modification of an existing transcription factor. However, the rapid loss of C/EBP-alpha protein may be a contributing factor to further transcriptional suppression of the GLUT4 gene at the later time points. In addition to the transcriptional effect, we report that TNF-induced destabilization of these mRNAs contributes to decreased expression of all three genes."
https://openalex.org/W1601135161,"The 5‘-flanking region of the S14 gene from -4316 to +18 contains regulatory sequences responsible for activation of promoter activity in response to elevated carbohydrate metabolism in primary hepatocytes. To map these sequences, a series of constructs containing various internal deletions of the S14 5‘-flanking sequence were assayed in primary hepatocytes. The region from -1601 to -1395 was found to be essential for this response. Comparison of the sequence of this S14 region to a region of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene that has been shown to mediate carbohydrate regulation (Thompson, K. S., and Towle, H. C. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 8679-8682) revealed a segment with 9 out of 10 identity. In both cases, this conserved sequence aligned with a DNase I footprint formed with hepatic nuclear extract. Oligonucleotides (approximately 30 base pairs) from either S14 or pyruvate kinase genes containing the conserved element bound to a hepatic nuclear factor(s) that gave identical complexes by mobility shift assay. Furthermore, these two oligonucleotides cross-competed for binding to the nuclear factor(s), suggesting that a common factor(s) binds to this conserved element. Reinsertion of the S14 oligonucleotide into an unresponsive S14 promoter construct restored the carbohydrate control. Moreover, this oligonucleotide could confer a glucose response when fused to a heterologous promoter. Thus, the S14 segment from -1457 to -1428 is a carbohydrate response element essential for the binding of nuclear factor(s) regulated by increased carbohydrate metabolism. This factor(s) may be common to the carbohydrate regulation of the S14 and pyruvate kinase genes."
https://openalex.org/W1512601207,"The biochemical processes responsible for the recognition and repair of cisplatin-damaged DNA in human cells are not well understood. We have developed a damaged DNA affinity precipitation technique that allows the direct visualization and characterization of cellular proteins that bind to cisplatin-damaged DNA. The method separates damaged DNA-binding proteins from complex radiolabeled cell mixtures and further resolves them into individual polypeptides by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This technique is complementary to gel retardation and Southwestern blotting analyses that have been previously used to identify cellular components that specifically bind to cisplatin-damaged DNA. Using this technique, we have characterized a set of HeLaS3 nuclear proteins of 26.5, 28, 90, and 97 kDa that specifically bind to cisplatin-DNA adducts. Competition studies with soluble cisplatin-damaged DNA confirmed these findings. The major cisplatin-damaged DNA-binding proteins of 26.5 and 28 kDa recognized adducts of DNA modified with cisplatin but not with its trans-isomer or with UV radiation. These proteins were purified 450-fold to near homogeneity by ion-exchange and cisplatin-damaged DNA affinity chromatography. Amino-terminal sequence analysis showed that the 26.5- and 28-kDa proteins were identical to high mobility group (HMG) proteins HMG-2 and HMG-1, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1511774179,"Polyethylene glycol (PEG) inhibited aggregation during refolding of bovine carbonic anhydrase B (CAB) through the formation of a nonassociating PEG-intermediate complex. Stoichiometric concentrations of PEG were required for complete recovery of active protein during refolding at aggregating conditions. For example, a PEG (Mr = 3350) to CAB molar ratio ([PEG]/[CAB]) of 2 was sufficient to inhibit aggregation during refolding at 1.0 mg/ml (33.3 microM) protein and 0.5 M guanidine hydrochloride. In addition, the PEG concentration required for enhancement was dependent upon the molecular weight and only molecular weights between 1000 and 8000 were effective in inhibiting aggregation. In the presence of PEG, the rate of refolding was the same as that observed for refolding without the formation of associated species. Refolding in the presence of PEG resulted in the rapid formation of a PEG complex with the molten globule first intermediate, and this PEG-intermediate complex did not aggregate. The CAB refolding kinetics in the presence of PEG were determined and used to develop a model of the PEG enhanced refolding pathway. The mathematical model was validated by independent activity measurements of CAB refolding. This model predicted that PEG enhanced refolding of CAB occurred by a specific interaction of PEG with the molten globule first intermediate to form a nonassociating complex which continued to fold at the same rate as the first intermediate. The predicted pathway and binding properties of PEG indicate that PEG enhanced refolding may be analogous to chaperonin mediated protein folding."
https://openalex.org/W2108696499,"Selected regions of the Hm1 muscarinic cholinergic receptor were mutated to analyze the molecular mechanisms of agonist-induced receptor internalization (or sequestration). The wild-type and mutant Hm1 genes were expressed, using pSG5, in U293 human kidney cells. Whereas surface receptor density measured with the polar tracer N-[3H]methylscopolamine was rapidly reduced by carbachol exposure, total receptor content measured with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate did not decline for at least 24 h, indicating the absence of extensive receptor down-regulation in U293 cells. Carbachol stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover paralleled receptor internalization, both with EC50 values of 10-20 microM. Furthermore, a D71N point mutation that prevented receptor activation also abolished carbachol-induced receptor internalization, indicating that receptor activation (but not necessarily second messenger stimulation) was required for internalization. Truncation of the COOH-terminal tail (K447 trunc) and point mutations of several potential Ser and Thr phosphorylation sites to Ala failed to affect receptor activation and internalization. In contrast, partial deletions of the third intracellular loop (i3) (Tyr208-Thr366) resulted in receptor mutants deficient in agonist-induced receptor internalization/sequestration. Various deletions caused either complete loss of internalization (d 232-358) or impaired internalization, ranging from 10 to 30% over 2 h, whereas wild-type Hm1 internalized to approximately 50%. Whereas the reason for the observed differences among the deficient deletion mutants remains unclear, the initial rate of N-[3H]methylscopolamine binding loss from the cell surface was much slower than that of wild-type Hm1 in each case. The deletion of only one single domain, 284-292 (SMESLTSSE), in the middle of i3 was consistently associated with impaired internalization. Domain 284-292 is partially conserved among closely related muscarinic receptors, whereas most of the remainder of i3 is not (except for the i3 membrane junctions), and similar Ser- and Thr-rich regions are present in many other G protein-coupled receptors. We propose that a small receptor domain in the middle of the i3 loop of Hm1 is involved in agonist-induced receptor internalization."
https://openalex.org/W1480482305,"Tubulin, the constituent protein of microtubules, is an alpha beta heterodimer; both alpha and beta exist in several isotypic forms whose functional significance is not precisely known. The antimitotic alkaloid colchicine binds to mammalian brain tubulin in a biphasic manner under pseudo-first-order conditions in the presence of a large excess of colchicine (Garland, D. L. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 4266-4272). We have studied the kinetics of colchicine binding to purified beta-tubulin isotypes and find that each of the purified beta-tubulin isotypes binds colchicine in a monophasic manner. The apparent on-rate constants for the binding of colchicine to alpha beta II-, alpha beta III-, and alpha beta IV-tubulin dimers are respectively 132 +/- 5, 30 +/- 2, and 236 +/- 7 M-1 s-1. When the isotypes are mixed, the kinetics become biphasic. Scatchard analysis revealed that the isotypes differ significantly in their affinity constants (Ka) for binding colchicine. The affinity constants are 0.24 x 10(6), 0.12 x 10(6), and 3.31 x 10(6) M-1, respectively, for alpha beta II-, alpha beta III-, and alpha beta IV-tubulin dimers. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the beta-subunit of tubulin plays a major role in the interaction of colchicine with tubulin. Our binding data raise the possibility that the tubulin isotypes might play important regulatory roles by interacting differently with other non-tubulin proteins in vivo, which in turn, may regulate microtubule-based functions in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W1489882701,"Three hydroxyribonucleosides catalyzing the oxido-reduction of NADH and K3F3(CN)6 were purified from Torula yeast RNA by a series of steps including sodium dodecyl sulfate/phenol extraction, nuclease P1 digestion, alkaline phosphatase digestion, anion-exchange chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography on an ODS column. Analysis by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy led to identification of the redox ribonucleosides as 5-hydroxyuridine, 8-hydroxyguanosine, and 8-hydroxyadenosine. Their mass spectra, chromatographic behavior, UV spectra, NMR spectra, and IR spectra were identical to those from natural and synthetic sources. Oxidoreduction activities were specific for K3Fe(CN)6 as the oxidant and NADH as the reductant; and their magnitudes decreased in the order 5-hydroxycytidine, 5-hydroxyuridine, 8-hydroxyguanosine, and 8-hydroxyadenosine. The fact that these nucleosides have redox activities suggests new functional roles for RNAs as catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W1539899414,"Factor VIIIa is a heterotrimer of the factor VIII heavy chain-derived A1 and A2 subunits plus the factor VIII light chain-derived A3-C1-C2 subunit. While the A1 and A3-C1-C2 subunits can be isolated as a stable dimer, the A2 subunit is weakly associated with the dimer. In the human protein, the association of A2 with dimer is reversible and governed by a pH-dependent dissociation constant. Using the specific activity of factor VIIIa as an indicator of trimer concentration, the Kd (pH 6.0) was determined to be 28 nM whereas at the more physiologic pH (pH 7.4) this value was approximately 260 nM. Results from pH shift experiments confirmed the reversible binding of A2 to dimer as did the capacity for high levels of exogenous A2 subunit to inhibit the spontaneous decay of factor VIIIa activity. A2 subunit associated with the A1 subunit in the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer based upon the capacity for free A1 subunit to inhibit the reconstitution of factor VIIIa from A2 subunit and dimer. These results indicate that the primary mechanism for the spontaneous decay of human factor VIIIa is the reversible dissociation of A2 subunit from the A1 subunit of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1539267410,"Differentiation of B16 mouse melanoma cells induced by retinoic acid (RA) is preceded by a large increase in protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) mRNA and protein. To determine the role of PKC alpha in the differentiation program, we stably transfected B16-F1 cells with a plasmid containing the full length PKC alpha cDNA driven by an SV40 promoter. Two out of thirty-two colonies screened were determined to overexpress PKC by 2-4-fold according to Western blot analysis and PKC enzyme activity. When compared to control cells (wild-type cells and cells transfected only with the neomycin resistance gene), PKC alpha overexpressing clones displayed longer doubling times, diminished anchorage-independent growth, and increased melanin production. RA treatment of control cells mimicked these phenotypic characteristics. When injected subcutaneously into syngeneic mice, PKC alpha overexpressing clones produced smaller tumors and had longer latencies than control cells. These findings, combined with the fact that phorbol esters down-regulate PKC and antagonize RA action suggest that PKC alpha plays a key role in the RA-induced melanoma differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1587023798,"We report that the cell surface glycoprotein CD4 expressed in HeLa cells can be metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitic acid. Analysis of the 3H-label after hydrolysis of the protein indicated that it was incorporated predominantly as palmitic acid. Comparison of the amount of [3H]palmitate incorporated into CD4 with that incorporated into a protein known to contain one molecule of esterified palmitate suggested that one to two molecules of palmitate were added to CD4. The fatty acid was readily cleaved from CD4 by treatment with weak base suggesting a thioester linkage. Mutations of each of 2 cysteine residues, Cys394 and Cys397, in CD4 at the junction of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains reduced labeling with [3H]palmitic acid, and mutation of both cysteines eliminated labeling. These results indicate that both cysteines are esterified to palmitate. Modification with palmitate was not required for expression of CD4 on the cell surface or for binding of p56lck to its cytoplasmic domain."
https://openalex.org/W1484898726,"Leader peptidase of Escherichia coli cleaves the leader sequence from the amino terminus of membrane and secreted proteins after these proteins insert across the membrane. Despite considerable research, the mechanism of catalysis of leader peptidase remains unknown. This peptidase cannot be classified using protease inhibitors to the serine, cysteine, aspartic acid, or metallo- classes of proteases (Zwizinski, C., Date, T., and Wickner, W. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3593-3597). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have attempted to place leader peptidase in one of these groups. We found that leader peptidase, lacking all of the cysteine residues, can cleave the leader peptide from procoat, the precursor to bacteriophage M13 coat protein. Replacement of each histidine residue with an alanyl residue was without effect on catalysis. Among all the serine and aspartic acid residues, serine 90 and serine 185 as well as aspartic acid 99, 153, 273, and 276 are necessary to cleave procoat in a detergent extract. However, only serine 90 and aspartic acid 153 were required for processing using a highly sensitive in vivo assay. In addition to the residues directly affecting catalysis, aspartic acid 99 plays a role in maintaining the structure of leader peptidase. Replacement of this residue with alanine results in a very unstable leader peptidase protein. This study thus defines two critical residues, serine 90 and aspartic acid 153, that may be directly involved in catalysis and provides evidence that leader peptidase belongs to a novel class of serine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1597236414,"We have previously reported that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) enhances expression of interleukin-6, collagenase, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and basic fibroblast growth factor genes in human omental microvascular endothelial (HOME) cells in culture. In this study, we found that treatment of HOME cells with TNF-alpha or interleukin-1 (IL-1) caused enhanced expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. A few-fold increase in both LDL binding activity and the receptor mRNA levels was observed when HOME cells were treated with either TNF-alpha or IL-1. Northern blot analysis showed that cellular expression of LDL receptor gene was significantly increased 12-24 h after exposure to TNF-alpha. No significant changes in the life-span of LDL receptor mRNA were observed in untreated and TNF-alpha-treated cells. Scatchard analysis showed an increased receptor number for LDL in TNF-alpha-treated cells. Parallel to increased LDL binding activity, internalization and degradation of LDL were also increased in HOME cells treated with TNF-alpha or IL-1. TNF-alpha-induced enhancement of LDL receptor gene expression was not observed when cycloheximide was present. Cellular mRNA level of SP-1 gene was increased about 3-4-fold at 12 h after treatment with TNF-alpha. Nuclear run-on assays showed increased transcription of LDL receptor gene as well as SP-1 gene by TNF-alpha. Gel retardation assay with the SP-1 consensus fragment showed that SP-1 binding activity was increased about 4-5-fold 12-24 h after treatment with TNF-alpha. NF-kB binding activity was also dramatically increased, but there is no NF-kB motif on the promoter for LDL receptor gene. The induction of LDL receptor by TNF might be mediated through a transcription factor, SP-1."
https://openalex.org/W1652134433,"We have characterized the interaction of the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) in the 5'-flanking region of the rat glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit gene with its trans-acting factor. The ARE core sequence, 5'-ggTGACaaaGC-3', previously identified as the cis-acting element required for activation of the Ya subunit gene by planar aromatic compounds and phenolic antioxidants, is shown to be the high affinity recognition motif for a trans-acting factor(s) as determined by gel mobility shift assays as well as methylation interference and protection studies. The DNA-protein interaction appears to occur in the major groove and involves the GpG dinucleotide preceding and the G residue within the TGAC tetramer on the coding strand of the core sequence. In addition, DNase I protection analysis maps an extended region 5' from the core recognition motif, which was shown previously to be essential for basal activity of the ARE. The trans-acting factor is present in nuclear extracts from untreated and tert-butylhydroquinone-treated cells as determined by photochemical cross-linking experiments. The cross-linked protein appears to be a heterodimer with subunit molecular weights of approximately 28,000 and approximately 45,000."
https://openalex.org/W1577770943,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae S-II was purified to near homogeneity as a protein stimulating RNA polymerase II. Four of seven lysyl endopeptidase-digested fragments of S-II were located in the PPR2 sequence reported previously. Analysis of a genomic clone of S-II revealed that S-II and PPR2 are the same protein consisting of 309 amino acid residues, and frame shifts were found in the sequence of PPR2 gene reported previously. Yeast S-II and mouse S-II showed high similarity in their amino acid sequences, especially in their amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions. A gene disruption experiment showed that an S-II null mutant was not lethal under usual growth conditions, indicating that S-II is not essential for the growth of yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1576838910,"The degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is stimulated by polyamines in a protein synthesis-dependent manner. It has been suggested that antizyme, an ODC-inhibiting protein induced by polyamines, is involved in the process of polyamine-stimulated ODC decay. In this study, we investigated the direct effect of antizyme on ODC decay in hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells. A truncated rat antizyme cDNA, Z1, was inserted into an expression vector at a site under the control of a glucocorticoid-inducible promoter and transfected into HTC cells. In the transfected cells dexamethasone increased the amount of Z1 mRNA and induced active antizyme in the absence of exogenous polyamines. When dexamethasone was added to cells with a high level of ODC, rapid decays of ODC activity and protein were elicited after a lag time. Cycloheximide abolished the effect of dexamethasone. These effects of dexamethasone were not observed in control HTC cells transfected with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. This study indicated that, once induced, antizyme stimulated ODC degradation independently of polyamines and strongly supported our previous hypothesis that the ODC decay-accelerating action of polyamines is mediated by antizyme."
https://openalex.org/W1547060065,"By use of multilamellar phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes of different acyl composition and cholesterol content as model membranes, we studied whether or not membrane fluidity affects the assembly process of Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin. Under conditions using fluid and solid membranes, we assayed accessibility (or hemolytic activity) of liposome-bound alpha-toxin to rabbit erythrocytes added, hexamerization of membrane-bound toxin using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under nondenaturating conditions, and susceptibility of liposome-bound toxin to trypsin digestion. Our data indicated 1) that alpha-toxin bound to PC membrane as a hemolytically active monomer (or reversibly bound state); 2) that when the membrane was fluidized either by phase transition of PC or by inclusion of cholesterol over 20 mol %, the hemolytically active monomer of the toxin was irreversibly converted to nonhemolytic monomer (and/or unstable oligomer) in a first-order kinetics with a t1/2 of about 1 min, and thereafter hexamerization of the toxin gradually proceeded in the following 60-90 min; 3) that alpha-toxin might have different topology and/or conformation in PC membrane, depending on the presence or absence of cholesterol in the PC membrane; and 4) that coexistence of unsaturated acyl chain-carrying PC and cholesterol was a prerequisite for efficient hexamerization of alpha-toxin in membrane. Thus, increase in membrane fluidity promoted the assembly process of S. aureus alpha-toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1600704552,"A recently cloned mouse cDNA designated F52 encodes a putative protein with striking sequence similarity to the MARCKS protein, a major cellular substrate for protein kinase C (PKC). Major regions of sequence similarity include the amino-terminal myristoylation consensus sequence and the central calmodulin-binding/PKC phosphorylation site domain. The F52 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli with apparent M(r) 50,000; it was a substrate for PKC and comigrated on two-dimensional electrophoresis with a myristoylated protein whose phosphorylation was stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in mouse neuroblastoma cells. The F52 protein also was myristoylated in E. coli by co-expression with N-myristoyltransferase. A 24-amino acid peptide derived from the protein's phosphorylation site domain was a good substrate for PKC; like the cognate MARCKS peptide, it was phosphorylated with high affinity (S0.5 = 173 nM) and positive cooperativity (KH = 5.4). The F52 peptide also bound calmodulin with high affinity (Kd = less than 3 nM); this binding could be disrupted by phosphorylation of the peptide with PKC, with a half-time of 8 min. The F52 protein is clearly a member of the MARCKS family as defined by primary sequence; in addition, the two proteins share several key attributes that may be functionally important."
https://openalex.org/W1523866401,"A 50-kDa protein, which binds to the growth-regulated gene (2A9) product, calcyclin in a calcium-dependent manner, was purified from bovine lung. Partial amino acid sequencing of the protein revealed it to be the bovine equivalent of rabbit lung CAP-50 (calcyclin-associated protein, 50 kDa), which is a member of the annexin family and binds to calcyclin in a calcium-dependent manner. Specific polyclonal antibodies to bovine lung CAP-50 were prepared. Comparative studies between CAP-50 and synexin (annexin VII) on the immunoreactivity against anti-CAP-50 antibodies and the ability of binding to calcyclin revealed that CAP-50 was a distinct molecule from synexin. Using specific polyclonal antibodies to bovine lung CAP-50, tissue distribution and subcellular distribution of CAP-50 were investigated. In most rat tissues, except those in the central nervous systems and kidney, CAP-50 is expressed at a high or moderate level. Both studies by subcellular fractionation and by indirect immunofluorescence staining of the rat embryonic fibroblast cell line, 3Y1, revealed that CAP-50 mainly localized in nuclei. Moreover, between the cells at interphase and at mitotic phase, different distributions of CAP-50 were observed. That is, in the cells at interphase, CAP-50 seemed to localize throughout the nucleoplasm. On the other hand, in the cells during mitosis, CAP-50 was concentrated at the loop-like structure around the mitotic apparatus. CAP-50 was found in isolated 3Y1 nuclei lacking outer nuclear membranes, and approximately 50% of CAP-50 was extracted from the nuclei by chelating calcium. Thus, CAP-50, a unique annexin, localizes in nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W1577960882,"Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) has been purified from the mitochondria of green pea leaves. Activity can be fractionated into two distinct peaks by ion exchange chromatography. While these two forms of the enzyme are immunologically indistinguishable, immunoinhibition experiments show the presence of a distinct non-mitochondrial third form of the enzyme to also be present in green pea leaves. While this mitochondrial form of SHMT is abundant in leaves it is absent from roots, although the two tissues have comparable SHMT activity. An antibody raised to purified mitochondrial SHMT was used to screen a cDNA expression library. The sequence of one of the isolated positive clones contained an open reading frame, which encoded a sequence that matched the amino acid sequence determined from the N terminus of the mature protein. The open reading frame encodes a mature protein of 487 amino acids with a M(r) of 54,000, together with a 27-31 amino acid serine-rich leader sequence, presumably required for mitochondrial targeting. The cDNA hybridizes to a small multigene family of 2-3 genes, which appear to be expressed predominantly in leaves. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the amino acid sequences of the rabbit mitochondrial and cytoplasmic SHMT, show that pea mitochondrial SHMT is equally similar to both of these enzymes. In addition, the rabbit sequences are more like one another than they are to the pea sequence, suggesting an interesting evolutionary relationship for these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1530754292,"A cytosolic protein factor(s) is involved in the import of precursor proteins into mitochondria. PBF (presequence binding factor) is a protein factor which binds to the precursor form (pOTC) of rat ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC) but not to the mature OTC, and is required for the mitochondrial import of pOTC. The precursors for aspartate aminotransferase and malate dehydrogenase as well as pOTC synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate were efficiently imported into the mitochondria. However, the precursors synthesized in the lysate depleted for PBF by treatment with pOTC-Sepharose were not imported. Readdition of the purified PBF to the depleted lysate fully restored the import. pOTC synthesized in the untreated lysate sedimented as a complex with a broad peak of around 9 S, whereas pOTC synthesized in the PBF-depleted lysate sedimented at an expected position of monomer (2.5 S). When the purified PBF was readded to the depleted lysate, pOTC sedimented as a complex of about 7 S. In contrast to most mitochondrial proteins, rat 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase is synthesized with no cleavable presequence and an NH2-terminal portion of the mature protein functions as a mitochondrial import signal. The thiolase synthesized in the PBF-depleted lysate could be efficiently imported into the mitochondria, and readdition of PBF had little effect on the import. The thiolase synthesized in the untreated, the PBF-depleted, or the PBF-readded lysate sedimented at an expected position of monomer (2.5 S). These observations provide support for the existence of PBF-dependent and -independent pathways of mitochondrial protein import."
https://openalex.org/W1607465591,"Abstract The first preliminary structure of a surface lipooligosaccharide from Haemophilus ducreyi has been determined. The major oligosaccharide was released by mild acid hydrolysis and analyzed by liquid secondary ion and tandem mass spectrometry. The mass spectral data combined with composition and methylation analysis yielded the most probable structure; Gal1----4GlcNAc1----3Gal1----4Hep1----6Glc1----( Hep1----2Hep1----)3,4Hep1---- KDO, where the reducing terminal 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (or KDO) exists in an anhydro form. This anhydro species results from the elimination of a phosphate from C-4 of KDO during mild acid hydrolysis. The core heptose trisaccharide consists of L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, but analysis of the peracetylated sugars indicated that the 1,4-linked heptose is likely D-glycero-D-manno-heptose. The monoclonal antibody 3F11 generated against Neisseria gonorrhoeae also binds to this lipooligosaccharide and suggests that the terminal trisaccharide is Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal beta 1----, an epitope found in the glycose moiety of the human erythrocyte glycosphingolipid lactoneotetraglycosylceramide. Mass spectrometric and composition analysis of the lipid A moiety shows that it is similar to the lipid A of Haemophilus influenzae strain I-69 Rd-/b+ proposed by Helander et al. (Helander, I. M., Lindner, B., Brade, H., Altmann, K., Lindberg, A. A., Rietschel, E. T., and Zahringer, U. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 177, 483-492). Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of the intact O-deacylated lipooligosaccharides gave an average Mr of 2710, and supported an overall structure consisting of the above nonasaccharide linked directly to a diphosphorylated lipid A moiety through the single KDO which is phosphorylated. This structure should provide a framework to investigate the roles of lipooligosaccharides in the host immunochemical response and pathology of H. ducreyi infection, a leading cause of genital ulcer disease."
https://openalex.org/W1937935589,"The nature of the porphyrin pi-cation radicals in the horseradish peroxidase and bovine liver catalase (BLC) compound I species have been investigated by studying their resonance Raman spectra. A variety of laser excitation and sample interrogation procedures have been employed in order to minimize previously documented problems arising from photoinduced conversions. With Soret band excitation, the spectra obtained for both species resemble that of a compound II-like photoproduct unless the samples are excited with residence times in the microsecond regime with very low (approximately 1 milliwatt) powers. When these precautions are taken, spectra attributable to the compound I species themselves are obtained. The spectrum for horseradish peroxidase compound I is similar to that reported by Paeng and Kincaid (Paeng, K.-J., and Kincaid, J. R. (1988) Am. Chem. Soc. 110, 7913-7915) using a similar approach. Both horseradish peroxidase and BLC compound I exhibit frequency shifts relative to their compound II species that are in the direction observed for model pi-cation radicals with predominant 2A2u character. The magnitudes of these shifts are smaller than those observed for heme models that lack aromatic axial ligands, but agree well with those observed on formation of the compound I analog of N alpha-acetyl microperoxidase-8 that has His as a proximal ligand. This observation is consistent with partial delocalization of the radical density onto the proximal His-170 and Tyr-357 ligands in horseradish peroxidase and BLC, respectively. The strong ligand field provided by these ligands on the proximal side and oxo ligand on the distal side of the heme group is apparently sufficient to reverse the 2A1u radical ground state preference observed for heme-like porphyrin species (e.g. octaethylporphyrins) with weak axial fields. Enhancement of several bands assigned to the Tyr-357 ligand has also been observed for BLC compound I with 406.7-nm excitation. This is attributed either to resonance with a tyrosinate----Fe(IV) charge transfer band or to the coupling provided by radical spin delocalization onto the tyrosinate ligand."
https://openalex.org/W203678940,"The effects of brefeldin A (BFA) on transferrin (Tf) transcellular transport, Tf receptor (TfR) distribution, and TfR-mediated endocytosis in filter-grown Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were studied. BFA (1.6 micrograms/ml) markedly enhanced the transcytosis of 125I-labeled Tf (125I-Tf) in both apical-to-basal and basal-to-apical directions; yet, BFA did not enhance the transcytosis of either native horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or membrane-bound HRP-poly(L-lysine) conjugates. Furthermore, this enhanced transcytosis of 125I-Tf was abolished either by competition with excess unlabeled Tf or by incubation at temperatures less than or equal to 25 degrees C. In addition, BFA treatment to MDCK cells: (a) increased 125I-Tf specific binding to the apical membrane and decreased 125I-Tf specific binding to the basal membrane; (b) decreased TfR recycling at the basolateral membrane; (c) altered the apical/basolateral distribution of TfRs in favor of the apical side; and (d) markedly increased 59Fe extraction, but not transcytosis, from apically endocytosed 59Fe-loaded Tf. These effects are consistent with a model in which BFA alters the traffic pattern of internalized Tf by decreasing basolateral TfR recycling, while diverting the nonrecycled fraction to the apical side of the cell. Our results indicate that, unlike the reported inhibition of polymeric IgA transcytosis (Hunziker, W., Whitney, J. A., and Mellman, I. (1991) Cell 67, 617-627), BFA can enhance the transcytosis of Tf in MDCK cells. Thus, by altering the intracellular traffic of ligand-receptor complexes, BFA can elicit either a decrease or an increase in transcytosis depending on the nature of the intracellular receptor processing."
https://openalex.org/W1575038515,"The 36-kDa beta 1, 35-kDa beta 2, and 6.5-kDa gamma 2 subunits of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins have been overexpressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system. The gamma 2 subunit expressed in Sf9 cells incorporated label derived from [3H]mevalonate and is therefore likely to be isoprenylated, as is its mammalian counterpart. Extracts of Sf9 cells doubly infected with viruses encoding a beta subunit and viruses encoding a gamma subunit are active in promoting the pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of a G protein alpha subunit. However, extracts from Sf9 cells singly infected with viruses encoding either a beta or gamma subunit are not active in this assay. Results demonstrate utility of the insect/baculovirus system for expressing G protein beta gamma subunits of defined composition."
https://openalex.org/W2166929619,"The different topology of palmitoyl-CoA ligase (on the cytoplasmic surface) and of lignoceroyl-CoA ligase (on the luminal surface) in peroxisomal membranes suggests that these fatty acids may be transported in different form through the peroxisomal membrane (Lazo, O., Contreras, M., and Singh, I. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 3981-3986), and this differential transport may account for deficient oxidation of lignoceric acid in X-adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) (Singh, I., Moser, A. B., Goldfisher, S., and Moser, H. W. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 4203-4207). To define the transport mechanism for these fatty acids through the peroxisomal membrane and its possible implication to lignoceric acid metabolism in X-ALD, we examined cofactors and energy requirements for the transport of palmitic and lignoceric acids in isolated peroxisomes from rat liver and peroxisomes isolated from X-ALD and control fibroblasts. The similar rates of transport of palmitoyl-CoA (87.6 +/- 6.3 nmol/h/mg protein) and palmitic acid in the fatty acid activating conditions (83.4 +/- 5.1 nmol/h/mg protein) and lack of transport of palmitic acid (4% of palmitoyl-CoA transport) when ATP and/or CoASH were removed or substituted by alpha,beta-methyleneadenosine-5'-triphosphate (AMPCPOP) and/or desulfoCoA-agarose from assay medium clearly demonstrate that transport of palmitic acid requires prior synthesis of palmitoyl-CoA by palmitoyl-CoA ligase on the cytoplasmic surface of peroxisomes. The 10-fold higher rate of transport of lignoceric acid (5.3 +/- 0.6 nmol/h/mg protein) as compared with lignoceroyl-CoA (0.41 +/- 0.11 nmol/h/mg protein) and lack of inhibition of transport of lignoceric acid when ATP and/or CoASH were removed or substituted with AMPCPOP or desulfoCoA-agarose suggest that lignoceric acid is transported through the peroxisomal membrane as such. Moreover, the lack of effect of removal of ATP or substitution with AMPOPCP (a nonhydrolyzable substrate) demonstrates that the translocation of palmitoyl-CoA and lignoceric acid across peroxisomal membrane does not require energy. The transport, activation, and oxidation of palmitic acid are normal in peroxisomes from X-ALD. The deficient lignoceroyl-CoA ligase (13% of control) and oxidation of lignoceric acid (10% of control) as compared with normal transport of lignoceric acid into peroxisomes from X-ALD clearly demonstrates that pathogenomonic accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (greater than C22) in X-ALD is due to the deficiency of peroxisomal lignoceroyl-CoA ligase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1600925677,"The Escherichia coli RecBCD holoenzyme and the individual constituent subunits have been purified from overproducing strains. The purified RecBCD holoenzyme has a native molecular mass of approximately 330 kDa, indicative of a heterotrimer subunit assembly. The RecB, RecC, and RecD subunits can associate in vitro to give nuclease, helicase, ATPase, and Chi-specific endonuclease activities which are indistinguishable from those of the RecBCD holoenzyme. At concentrations at which the reconstituted RecB + C + D enzyme is very active, none of the individual RecB, RecC, or RecD subunits have readily detectable activities of the holoenzyme, except RecB protein which had previously been shown to exhibit DNA-dependent ATPase activity (Hickson, I. D., Robson, C. N., Atkinson, K. E., Hutton, L., and Emmerson, P. T. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1224-1229). At higher concentrations and with shorter DNA substrates reconstituted RecBC protein exhibits low levels of helicase and exonuclease activity."
https://openalex.org/W1627716351,"The substrate specificity of a calcium-independent, 97-kDa phospholipase B purified from guinea pig intestine was further investigated using various natural and synthetic lipids. The enzyme was equally active toward enantiomeric phosphatidylcholines under conditions allowing a strict phospholipase A activity. The lysophospholipase activity declined with the following substrates: 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine greater than 1-palmitoyl-propanediol-3-phosphocholine greater than 1-palmitoyl-glycol-2-phosphocholine, suggesting some influence of the polar residue vicinal to the cleavage site. The enzyme also acted on various neutral lipids including triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, and monoacylglycerol, whereas cholesteryl oleate remained refractory to enzymatic hydrolysis. The lipase hydrolyzed sequentially the sn-2 and sn-1 acyl ester bonds of diacylglycerol, although some direct cleavage of the external acyl ester bond could also occur, as shown with diacylglycerol analogues bearing a nonhydrolyzable alkyl ether or amide bond in the sn-1 or sn-2 position. The three main activities of the enzyme (phospholipase A2, lysophospholipase, and diacylglycerol lipase) were resistant to 4-bromophenacyl bromide, but they were inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and diisopropyl fluorophosphate, suggesting the possible involvement of both cysteine and serine residues in a single active site. It is concluded that guinea pig intestinal phospholipase B, which was also detected in rat and rabbit, is actually a glycerol ester lipase with broad substrate specificity and some unique enzymatic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1581567789,"Adenosine deaminase (ADA), an enzyme of purine metabolism, is highly expressed in four tissues of the mouse: the maternal decidua, the fetal placenta, the keratinizing epithelium of the upper alimentary tract (tongue, esophagus, and forestomach), and the absorptive epithelium of the proximal small intestine. ADA is produced at relatively low levels in all other tissues. To identify genetic elements that direct appropriate prenatal and postnatal expression of the ADA gene, a segment of DNA including the ADA promoter and 6.4 kilobases of the adjacent 5' flanking region was tested for the ability to direct the expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice. In seven lines of transgenic mice studied, this construct directed high levels of reporter gene expression in the placenta and forestomach and exhibited correct developmental regulation in these tissues. This construct failed to direct significant reporter gene expression to either the maternal decidua or the proximal small intestine. Thus, different gene regulatory elements are required to target high expression to the four tissues characterized by high levels of ADA."
https://openalex.org/W1540963830,"The Escherichia coli enzyme tRNA(m1G)methyltransferase, one of a group of post-transcription tRNA-modifying enzymes, shows remarkable specificity in selecting the tRNA species and the specific guanosine base to be methylated. To examine the structural basis of this specificity, we synthesized a total of 15 modifications of tRNA(1Leu) and measured their methylation reaction kinetics in vitro. Elimination of any one of the three tRNA side loops, the V loop, the T loop, or the D loop, reduced the Vmax for methylation by about 1 order of magnitude. Elimination of all three side loops reduced Vmax by about 2 orders of magnitude. Clearly, gross tRNA structure is important for full enzyme activity. At the bottom of the stem proximal to the anticodon loop, in the pair at positions 31-39, substitution of a G-C for a C-G, a change that should not weaken the helical structure, had little effect on Vmax or Km. However, substitution of a G for a C increased Vmax and Km, whereas substitution of a C for G sharply reduced Vmax and, to a lesser extent, Km. These results appear to be a consequence of the principle that purines are better than pyrimidines in the stacking of adjacent bases for stability. Stacking in the stem structure appears to be important for methylation enzyme activity. In the anticodon loop itself, changing a U to a C had little effect, but changing the G of the anticodon to a C reduced Vmax over 20-fold, demonstrating the importance of the presence of the anticodon G adjacent to the G being methylated for enzyme recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1534144492,"A method is proposed for the measurement of the flux through the glycerol phosphate shuttle in pancreatic islets. Such a flux is taken as the ratio between the production of 3HOH and the specific radioactivity of L-[2-3H]glycerophosphate in islets exposed to [2-3H]glycerol. D-Glucose and non-glucidic nutrient secretagogues, such as 2-ketoisocaproate and 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylate, stimulate, in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, circulation in the glycerol phosphate shuttle. The shuttle flux is commensurate with the fraction of pyruvate generation which is not coupled with L-lactate production. These findings support the view that a rise in D-glucose concentration leads to activation of the FAD-linked mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase through an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1675357682,"There is little dispute that high density lipoprotein (HDL) binds to cells, however, the nature of the interaction is not fully understood. We now present evidence for a new binding site of higher affinity but lower capacity than the sites previously described in the literature. This new site is characterized by high affinity/low capacity for HDL binding (Kd = 0.94 microgram/ml, Bmax = 36 ng/mg), while the low affinity site (Kd = 36 micrograms/ml, Bmax approximately 700 ng/mg) appears to be consistent with the literature values for the interaction of HDL with cells and isolated membranes. Proteolysis of HDL with trypsin abolished its interaction with the high affinity site, suggesting an apolipoprotein requirement, while having no effect on binding to the lower affinity site. Kinetic rates of association/dissociation were determined in order to further characterize the high affinity site. At a concentration which favored the binding of HDL with the high affinity site (1 microgram/ml, 37 degrees C), the time course of association of HDL with rat liver plasma membranes, displayed a biphasic pattern, requiring 6-8 h to reach the level of binding predicted from the saturation studies. The second phase was highly sensitive to temperature, being considerably slower at 24 degrees C and totally abolished at 0 degrees C. A kinetic Kd, derived from the measured association and dissociation rate constants (Kd = 0.31 microgram/ml), was found to be of a similar magnitude to the Kd calculated for the high affinity site by Scatchard analysis (Kd = 0.94 microgram/ml). In summary, the high affinity site on rat liver plasma membranes displays an apoprotein requirement and kinetic parameters, consistent with a ligand-receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2119208304,"We have studied the regulated degradation of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase within the endoplasmic reticulum in cells permeabilized with digitonin. Using Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with a plasmid encoding HMGal, a chimeric protein containing the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase coupled to beta-galactosidase, we have demonstrated mevalonate and sterol-stimulated loss of beta-galactosidase activity. In pulse-chase experiments we have demonstrated mevalonate-stimulated degradation of both HMGal and HMG-CoA reductase. The rate of mevalonate-stimulated degradation observed in permeabilized cells tends to be slightly slower than that observed in intact cells treated with mevalonate and is dependent upon incubation of cells with mevalonate prior to permeabilization. The degradation process measured in this report extends a previous report of HMG-CoA reductase degradation in digitonin-permeabilized cells (Leonard, D. A., and Chen, H. W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 7914-7919) by mimicking key physiological features of the in vivo process, including: stimulation by regulatory molecules, specifically mevalonate and sterols; inhibition by cycloheximide; and inhibition by an inhibitor of neutral cysteine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1524747696,"The Co beta-cyano derivative of the cobamide isolated from Salmonella typhimurium was identified as Co alpha-(alpha-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolyl)-Co beta-cyanocobamide, indicating that this bacterium synthesizes 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) de novo. We found that mutants deficient in the synthesis of DMB can incorporate benzimidazole without modification to form Co alpha-(alpha-benzimidazolyl)cobamide, a cobamide that is physiologically active. The analysis of the nutritional requirements of mutants deficient in DMB synthesis identified 4,5-dimethylphenylenediamine as a putative intermediate in the synthesis of the imidazole ring of DMB. Our results suggest that the CobII region of the cob operon of S. typhimurium only encodes functions involved in the synthesis of the imidazole ring of DMB."
https://openalex.org/W2154555344,"Abstract In the absence of NADH, at 25 degrees C, partially purified NADH:nitrate reductase undergoes an approximately 50% reduction of its initial activity during 2 h. With the increase of inactivation, the NADH and nitrite concentration time curves become typical sigmoidal, i.e. the reaction velocity of the nitrate reductase catalyzed reaction goes through a maximum before equilibrium is reached. About 80% of the original activity of nitrate reductase is restored when the enzyme is incubated for 2 min with 200 microM NADH or NADPH. Also other NADH substrate analogues have similar effects in restoring the lost activity. After incubation with the reduced pyridine nucleotides, the sigmoidal appearance of the NADH concentration time curve disappears almost completely. Despite the fact that NADPH increases the activity of the enzyme, NADPH does not show any competition with the NADH-binding site of nitrate reductase and does not produce nitrite in the absence of NADH. It is therefore concluded that there must be an additional allosteric site which binds either NADH or NADPH, or other pyridine nucleotides with the effect of increasing the activity of the enzyme. A kinetic model is presented which simulates the observed experimental findings."
https://openalex.org/W1563002044,"Mouse interleukin-2 (mIL-2) mutant proteins with subunit-specific receptor binding defects have been previously described. Some of these mutant proteins are unable to trigger a maximum proliferative response of T cells. In this study, mIL-2 and mIL-2 mutant proteins were labeled with 32P, and their association and dissociation kinetics with the high affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) were investigated. A mIL-2 mutant protein with a partial defect in binding to the low affinity component of IL-2R had a slower on-rate than mIL-2. On the other hand, a mIL-2 antagonist with a binding defect to the intermediate affinity component of IL-2R had a normal on-rate, whereas its off-rate at 37 degrees C was faster than mIL-2. This fast off-rate at physiological temperature interfered with mIL-2 internalization. When three mIL-2 partial agonists, each inducing a different maximal response, were examined, no difference was found between their dissociation rates or their internalization properties. The significance of these findings for the function of each receptor subunit in the IL-2R complex, as well as for the mechanism of activation of the receptor, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1560065564,"The dnaJ deletion mutant K7052(lambda dnaK) has a temperature-sensitive defect in the synthesis of beta-galactosidase. We confirmed this operon-specific and temperature-sensitive defect in cell-free extracts prepared from the mutant cells and found that the missing factor was CRP. In the mutant, the cellular concentration of CRP was too low to allow the expression of the lac operon at a nonpermissive temperature. Introduction of a CRP over-producing plasmid into the dnaJ deletion mutant suppressed the defect of beta-galactosidase synthesis. The lower content of CRP in the mutant was found to result from extreme instability of the protein. These results strongly suggested that the heat shock protein dnaJ is involved in the stabilization (or degradation) of CRP."
https://openalex.org/W1586867410,"Incubation of phenyldiazene (PhN = NH) with lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme (CYP51) that oxidatively removes the 14 alpha-methyl group of lanosterol, results in the appearance of a 478-nm band indicative of phenyl-iron complex formation. In situ oxidation of the phenyl-iron complex by ferricyanide yields exclusively the N-phenylprotoporphyrin IX regioisomer with the phenyl group on the nitrogen of pyrrole ring C (NC). The biphenyl-iron complex formed in the analogous reaction of the enzyme with biphenyldiazene similarly rearranges on treatment with ferricyanide to the NC regioisomer of N-biphenylprotoporphyrin IX. The active site cavity must therefore be at least 10 A high directly above the iron atom and pyrrole ring C of the heme group, and lanosterol binds to the enzyme in the region above pyrrole ring C. Phenyl-iron complex formation is not detected spectroscopically with cytochrome P-450SG1, a catalytically inactive G310D mutant of lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase in which the sixth iron coordination site is thought to be occupied by an imidazole ligand. Nevertheless, oxidation of the phenyldiazene-treated enzyme with ferricyanide provides the NA and NC regioisomers of N-phenylprotoporphyrin IX in a 40:60 ratio. The single amino acid substitution in cytochrome P-450SG1 thus causes a conformational change that retracts the amino acid residues that cover pyrrole ring A and moves an imidazole ligand into the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1599599919,"Fatty acid ethyl ester synthases metabolize ethanol nonoxidatively in those extrahepatic organs most commonly damaged by alcohol abuse. This study was designed to isolate and purify human myocardial synthase-II, one of the enzymes responsible for catalyzing the formation of fatty acid ethyl esters. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of human myocardial cytosol at pH 8.0 separated synthase-I, synthase-II, and synthase-III activities, eluting at conductivities of 5, 7, and 11 mS, respectively. From this elution profile, fatty acid ethyl ester synthase-II accounts for up to 50% of total synthesis in the human heart. This enzyme species was purified over 2200-fold to homogeneity after chromatography over hydroxylapatite, CM-cellulose, and hydroxylapatite. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this homogeneous species showed a single band at 65 kDa which corresponded to its molecular weight determined by gel filtration. This molecular weight and its lack of glutathione transferase activity indicate that this species is not related to synthase-I and -III. Homogeneous synthase-II has a Vmax for palmitate, stearate, oleate, and linoleate of 70, 80, 140, and 120 nmol/mg/h, respectively. The Km for palmitate, stearate, oleate, and linoleate is 0.19, 0.12, 0.10, and 0.18 mM, respectively. The substrate specificity with respect to alcohol chain length was also investigated in the presence of 0.65 mM [14C]oleic acid. The Vmax for methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol was 180, 100, 280, and 410 nmol/mg/h, respectively. The Km for methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol was 1.16, 1.04, 0.58, and 0.33 M, respectively. The N-terminal 17-amino acid sequence of human synthase-II does not correspond to any known N-terminal amino acid sequence, indicating that this may be a novel protein. However, it has over 70% homology to a sequence close to the C terminus of rabbit cytochrome P-450IIC1 and over 50% homology to a sequence of human hemopexin starting at residue 16. Synthase-II does not cross-react with human hemopexin antibody and rat cytochrome P-450C antibody. Thus, this study provides evidence that synthase-II is a novel protein, distinct from synthase-I and -III, and it also provides a foundation for subsequent cloning and genetic studies of fatty acid ethyl ester synthase-II in man."
https://openalex.org/W1515059043,"The long-term regulatory effect of insulin on glucose transport activity and glucose transporter expression was examined in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) transfectants that overexpress either human insulin receptors of the wild type (CHO-R cells) or human insulin receptors mutated at two major autophosphorylation sites, Tyr1162 and Tyr1163 (CHO-Y2 cells). Previous studies showed that, when acutely stimulated by insulin, CHO-Y2 cells exhibit decreased receptor kinase activity along with decreased signaling of several pathways, including that for glucose transport, as compared with CHO-R cells. We now report the following. (i) When treated for 24 h with insulin (10(-10) to 10(-6) M), CHO-R and CHO-Y2 cells displayed closely similar concentration-dependent increases in 2-deoxyglucose uptake. In both transfectants, the maximal insulin-induced increase (approximately 3.5-fold) in uptake was cycloheximide-sensitive and was paralleled by equivalent increases in the levels of GLUT-1 immunoreactive protein and mRNA. (ii) By contrast, under similar conditions, CHO-Y2 cells exhibited a marked decrease in their response to insulin for [U-14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen (decreased sensitivity and maximal responsiveness) and for [U-14C]leucine incorporation into protein (decreased sensitivity) as compared with CHO-R cells. (iii) After a 24-h treatment with 10(-7) M insulin, CHO-R (but not CHO-Y2) cells showed a decreased ability to respond to a subsequent acute insulin stimulation of either receptor exogenous kinase activity or 2-deoxyglucose uptake as compared with respective untreated controls. These results indicate that (i) insulin receptors mutated at Tyr1162 and Tyr1163 retain normal signaling of the long-term stimulatory effect of insulin on glucose transport activity and GLUT-1 expression, but not on glycogenesis and overall protein synthesis; (ii) these three insulin signaling pathways may be triggered by distinct domains of the insulin receptor beta-subunit; and (iii) wild-type (but not twin-tyrosine mutant) receptors undergo negative regulation by chronic insulin treatment for subsequent signaling of acute biological actions of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2341270747,"The locus of human haptoglobin (Hp) molecules that interacts with human hemoglobin (Hb) was examined by the differential labeling technique. First, amino groups of Hp were extensively labeled with ethyl acetimidate (EAI) either in the free state (experiment A) or in the equimolar complex with Hb (experiment B). Each of the labeled Hp samples was reduced and S-carboxymethylated, and the remaining amino groups were then allowed to react with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) under denatured conditions. Only 0.6 mol/mol of the trinitrophenyl (TNP) group was introduced into the heavy chain of Hp in experiment A, whereas 2.5 mol/mol of TNP groups were into the same chain in experiment B. The extent of TNP modification for the light chain was very low in either of the experiments. The amino acid residues carrying TNP groups in the heavy chain were identified by the peptide mapping procedure. They were Ile1, Lys136, and Lys218 in experiment B, and only Ile1 in experiment A. These findings suggest that epsilon-amino groups of Lys136 and Lys218 in the heavy chain are both situated within the Hb-binding locus of Hp, and that the alpha-amino group of Ile1 is buried inside the molecule either in the presence or absence of Hb."
https://openalex.org/W1503327224,"Insulin receptors in human placental membranes were photoaffinity-labeled with a radioactive human insulin-like growth factor I (hIGF-I) photoprobe N epsilon B28-monoazidobenzoyl 125I-hIGF-I either alone or together with a non-radioactive insulin photoprobe N epsilon B29-monoazidobenzoyl insulin. Precipitation of the solubilized receptors with anti-insulin antibody showed that receptors labeled with the radioactive hIGF-I photoprobe were detected in the immunoprecipitate only when photolabeling was carried out in the presence of the non-radioactive insulin photoprobe. Comparable results were obtained in converse experiments using a radioactive insulin photoprobe N epsilon B29-monoazidobenzoyl 125I-insulin, a non-radioactive hIGF-I photoprobe N epsilon B28-monoazidobenzoyl hIGF-I, and an antibody to hIGF-I. The amount of radioactive receptors precipitated by either the anti-insulin antibody or the anti-hIGHF-I antibody was close to the expected amount. These observations demonstrate that the insulin receptor is bivalent being capable of binding two molecules of ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1521211839,"Certain enzymes normally associated with peroxisomes, such as the dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) acyltransferase involved in plasmalogen biosynthesis, are present at low levels in peroxisome-deficient mutants of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We now show that the aminoglycoside G418 increases the residual DHAP acyltransferase in mutant ZR-82 by 60-fold. This is accompanied by a dose- and time-dependent restoration of the plasmalogen content. G418 treatment of ZR-82 also increases residual peroxisomal beta-oxidation activity by 3.8-fold. G418 does not affect wild-type CHO cells (CHO-K1) or a different peroxisome-deficient mutant, ZR-78.1. The effects of G418 on ZR-82 are transient, since plasmalogens and DHAP-acyltransferase decline to basal levels 5 days after G418 withdrawal. Other aminoglycosides and lysosomotropic agents do not alter plasmalogen levels in ZR-82. The subcellular distribution of catalase (an enzyme of the peroxisomal matrix which is present in normal amounts in peroxisome-deficient mutants but is mislocalized in the cytosol) is unaffected by G418 treatment of ZR-82, demonstrating that G418 does not restore peroxisomes. Localization of catalase by immunofluorescence microscopy confirms a total absence of intact peroxisomes in ZR-82, either before or after exposure to G418. This study is the first to demonstrate that some peroxisome-deficient mutants can be induced to accumulate functional DHAP acyltransferase and other peroxisomal enzymes, usually missing in the absence of peroxisomes. G418 may have some therapeutic value in selected patients with inborn errors of peroxisome assembly, such as Zellweger syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1514126928,"Isomer-specific mechanisms of conjugation were investigated by evaluating the hepatic glucuronidation of the enantiomers of the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton. The glucuronidation of the individual isomers was stereoselective, as dog hepatic microsomes glucuronidated the S-isomer but failed to generate a glucuronide conjugate of the R-isomer. In combination, the nonglucuronidated R-isomer caused a concentration-dependent increase in the rate of glucuronidation of its enantiomorph. Kinetic analysis of this interaction indicated that the R-isomer affected rates of glucuronidation by decreasing the Km of the S-isomer for this process. This effect appeared enantioselective as the achiral analogue A-65838 had no effect on the Vmax and Km of S-isomer glucuronidation. The data were modeled using Michaelis-Menten kinetics in which the Km of S-isomer glucuronidation was reduced in a saturable manner by the concentration of the R-isomer. These data indicate that the nonconjugated R-isomer competitively activates the glucuronidation of its enantiomorph. To our knowledge, these data represent the first demonstration of enantiomeric activation of an enzyme involved in hepatic drug metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1645916895,"In order to elucidate the role of 5 alpha-reductase in the ovarian pubertal transition from 5 alpha-reduced to non-5 alpha-reduced steroids, we examined the characteristics and regulation of granulosa cell (GC) 5 alpha-reductase activity. Maximum activity was observed at 37 degrees C and at a pH of 6.5-8.0. Synthetic 4-aza-3-oxosteroids proved to be potent inhibitors (76% inhibition at 0.1 microM) of ovarian 5 alpha-reductase activity, and 20 alpha-DHP was a better substrate than either progesterone or testosterone (4- or 7-fold higher affinity constants, respectively). The Km (20 alpha-DHP) of the enzyme was 0.50 +/- 0.03 microM and 0.75 +/- 0.20 microM in homogenates of whole ovaries and GC, respectively. 17 beta-Estradiol was a non-competitive inhibitor (KI = 6.97 microM). 5 alpha-Reductase activity was 22-fold (immature) to 68-fold (mature) higher in liver than ovary and 4-fold higher in theca-interstitial shells than in isolated GC. Ovarian 5 alpha-reductase activity decreased markedly with age (greater than 60% inhibition in mature, randomly cycling rats as compared to immature rats). In vivo administration of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to immature rats produced a dose-dependent decrease in GC 5 alpha-reductase activity (36 +/- 1.1% and 46 +/- 5.9% inhibition following 12 micrograms and 24 micrograms FSH, respectively). Similarly, the in vitro provision of FSH (100 ng/ml) to cultured GC from immature rats resulted in (36-59%) inhibition in 5 alpha-reduced steroids. Inasmuch as FSH promotes GC development and the advancement of puberty, its ability to switch-off ovarian 5 alpha-reductase activity may enhance the formation of biologically potent (i.e. non-5 alpha-reduced) progestins as well as the availability of aromatizable androgens, in the best interests of pubertal steroidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1494913021,"Abstract Studies of the mechanism of lipid-induced regulation of the microsomal enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase have been extended by examining the influence of charge within the polar region on the ability of lipids to activate delipidated pure enzyme. The effects of net negative charge, of charge separation in phosphocholine, and of the distribution of charge in the polar region of lipids were studied using the GT2p isoform isolated from pig liver. Prior experiments have shown that lipids with net negative charge inhibit the enzyme (Zakim, D., Cantor, M., and Eibl, H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 5164-5169). The current experiments show that the extent of inhibition on a molar basis increases as the net negative charge increases from -1 to -2. The inhibitory effect of negatively charged lipids is on the functional state of the enzyme and is not due to electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged substrates of the enzyme. Although the inhibitory effect of net negative charge is removed when negative charge is balanced by a positive charge due to a quaternary nitrogen, neutrality of the polar region is not a sufficient condition for activation of the enzyme. In addition to a balance of charge between Pi and the quaternary nitrogen, the distance between the negative and positive charges and the orientation of the dipole created by them are critical for activation of GT2p. The negative and positive charges must be separated by the equivalent of three -CH2- groups for optimal activation by a lipid. Shortening this distance by one -CH2- unit leads to a lipid that is ineffective in activating the enzyme. Reversal of the orientation of the dipole in which the negative charge is on the polymethylene side of the lipid-water interface and the positive charge extends into water also produces a lipid that is not effective for activating GT2p. On the other hand, lipids with phosphoserine as the polar region, which has the normal P-N distance but carries a net negative charge, do not inhibit GT2p. This result again illustrates the importance of the dipole of phosphocholine for modulating the functional state of GT2p."
