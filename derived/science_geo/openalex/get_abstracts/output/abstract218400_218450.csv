https://openalex.org/W2015051690,"As has been shown in the previous communication1, we have obtained tetramethylpyrazine from cultures of a strain of Bacillus subtilis and it had the characteristic smell of fermented soybean. The fermented soybean is the favourite food as ‘natto’ among Japanese people. The isolation of tetramethylpyrazine from ‘natto’ has been described2. Since Bacillus natto is a bacterium which ferments soybean to produce ‘natto’, we made an attempt to isolate tetramethylpyrazine from cultures of this bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W1994495289,"A hitherto unreported disease of infant mice is described. The agent reproduces upon passage, is filterable, is confined mainly to the gastrointestinal tract in infant and adult mice, causes death in infants and inapparent infection in adults, and is sensitive to mild heat, ether, and sodium deoxycholate. Unique and characteristic morphologic changes occur in the epithelial cells of the intestine in infected infant mice. These consist in the development of multinucleated giant cells designated ""balloon cells.""."

https://openalex.org/W1562239681,"The citrate-condensing enzyme was studied with D/sub 2/O and deuteroacetylcoenzyme A. The magnitude of the isotope rate effect (k/sub H2O/o = 1.4), with deuteroacetylcoenzyme A, is independent of pH. The isotope rate effects of the forward and reverse reactions in D/sub 2/O are of different magnitude and are pH(pD)-dependent. When the isotope rate effect of the forward reaction reaches its max-mum (k/sub H2O/:k/sub D2O/ 3-8 at pH (or pD) = 7.5), there is no effect on the rate of the reverse reaction. In both the forward and reverse reactions, the isotope rate effects invert on the basic side of their pH(pD) curves. The observations are discussed in terms of shifted pK values of groups on the active enzyme-substrate complex. (auth)"

https://openalex.org/W2025492388,"Recent experiments have suggested that paired-associate items which are practiced and missed are equivalent to new items on future trials, supporting an all-or-none interpretation of the formation of associative bonds. Experiments reported here show that if correct items are discarded after each trial the probability of getting a missed item correct on the next trial is higher than the probability of getting a new item correct."

https://openalex.org/W2054655545,"RECENT work by Davison and his collaborators1–3 has shown that cholesterol may be incorporated in the nervous tissues of myelinating chickens and rabbits and that this cholesterol will persist in these tissues for considerable lengths of time. Our interests in the metabolism of cholesterol and other sterols prompted us to compare the distributions in chicken tissues of injected sitosterol and lanosterol with that of cholesterol. Emulsions of cholesterol-7-3H (purchased from New England Nuclear Co., Boston, Mass.), sitosterol3-H (randomly labelled, gift of Dr. Leon Swell), and lanosterol-3H (randomly labelled, gift of Dr. George J. Alexander) in saline were prepared by the method used for preparation of cholesterol-14C emulsions for experiments involving mitochondrial oxidation of this sterol4. Newly hatched White Leghorn chicks were used and the appropriate sterol emulsion (0.50 ml.) was injected directly into the yolk sac. After four days, radioactivity could be detected in the brain tissue of chickens from each group. After 9 weeks the one surviving chicken in each group was killed by exsanguination. The blood was collected in centrifuge tubes and the erythrocytes separated. All the brain, cord, liver, spleen and aorta was excised, weighed and dissolved in strong potassium hydroxide. The non-saponifiable fraction was assayed for tritium radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. Small pieces of sciatic nerve were taken from each chicken and all showed slight but consistently detectable radioactivity. Other findings are shown in Table 1."

https://openalex.org/W2036775416,I HAVE developed an assay for the measurement of luteotrophin in hypophysectomized adult mice which depends on the increase in the weight of a damaged horn of the uterus (formation of deciduomata). Mice were hypophysectomized on the first day of diœstrus and 48 h later the endometrium of the right horn of the uterus was injured. The animals were injected daily for 5 days with a preparation of luteotrophin commencing immediately after hypophysectomy and killed on the sixth day. The response was recorded as positive if the weight of the damaged horn was at least 11 mg greater than the weight of the control horn. The results were expressed as the percentage of animals with a positive response and a probit transformation was used for parallel line assays. Details of this method will be published shortly.

https://openalex.org/W2069508608,"THE structural1 and pharmacological2–6 similarity between glycyrrhetinic acid and adrenal corticoids has been reported. Glycyrrhetinic acid resembles the corticoids in mineralocorticoid2,3, anti-inflammatory4,5, anti-œstrogenic5 and anti-leukæmic6 activity. Since the glycoside, glycyrrhizin, has an inhibitory action on the pituitary-adrenal system7–9, it was of interest to ascertain whether the aglycone, glycyrrhetinic acid, exerted similar action."

https://openalex.org/W2006974525,IT has recently been reported that a water-soluble protein extracted from brain tissue has encephalitogenic activity1. The method of extraction of this water-soluble protein is very similar to that used by Dounce and Monty for the extraction of histones from rat liver nuclei2. Lederer3 has reported that killed cells of the H 37 RV strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis can produce allergic encephalomyelitis in rabbits. A basic protein from this same strain has been shown to induce a positive tuberculin reaction4. To determine whether a synthetic basic polypeptide might influence the production of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis we examined the effect of polylysine on this experimental disease in rabbits.

https://openalex.org/W2064747999,"IT is generally known that, during the inflammatory process, morphologically different cell-types appear in a certain sequence in the exudate. Recently, on the basis of autoradiographic experiments, Speirs et al.1 have reported that eosinophil polymorpho-nuclear cells were phagocytized by mononuclear cells and this phenomenon is probably responsible for the synthesis of antibodies in these cells."

Since that time this method has been used clinically, but opinions as to its value are not undivided. In recent years the method has been revised experimentally. Again results are not equivocal1."
