https://openalex.org/W2012843157,"Rac1 is a member of the Ras superfamily of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) that act as molecular switches to control cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell growth. Analogous to Ras, constitutively activating point mutations of Rac1 cause tumorigenic transformation of cell lines. However, there is no information about whether Rac1 is also mutated in vivo. After RT - PCR of Rac1, several clones of seven benign and 10 malignant breast cancer tissues as well as eight breast cancer cell lines were sequenced. Only single-nucleotide polymorphisms of Rac1 could be detected, and none of these corresponded to constitutively activating point mutations that have been used in cell lines for transformation. While sequencing Rac1 in breast tissues, a new Rac1 isoform with an insertion of 19 codons within the reading frame of Rac1 close to switch region II was identified and named Rac1b. The Rac1b protein acts like a fast cycling GTPase in GTP binding and hydrolysis assays. In Northern and Western blot experiments both Rac1 RNA and Rac1 protein had a significantly higher expression in breast cancer tissues compared to normal breast tissue samples. Immunohistochemical staining of Rac1 showed weak Rac1 expression in benign breast disease but high expression level in ductal carcinoma-in-situ, primary breast cancer, and lymph node metastases. In addition, breast tumor cells from patients with recurrent disease had Rac1 expression at the plasma membrane, suggesting activation of Rac1, in patients with aggressive breast cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2116947619,"We have shown previously that partial inhibition of the cardiac myocyte Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activates signal pathways that regulate myocyte growth and growth-related genes and that increases in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are two essential second messengers within these pathways. The aim of this work was to explore the relation between [Ca(2+)](i) and ROS. When myocytes were in a Ca(2+)-free medium, ouabain caused no change in [Ca(2+)](i), but it increased ROS as it did when the cells were in a Ca(2+)-containing medium. Ouabain-induced increase in ROS also occurred under conditions where there was little or no change in [Na(+)](i). Exposure of myocytes in Ca(2+)-free medium to monensin did not increase ROS. Increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, an early event induced by ouabain, was also independent of changes in [Ca(2+)](i) and [Na(+)](i). Ouabain-induced generation of ROS in myocytes was antagonized by genistein, a dominant negative Ras, and myxothiazol/diphenyleneiodonium, indicating a mitochondrial origin for the Ras-dependent ROS generation. These findings, along with our previous data, indicate that increases in [Ca(2+)](i) and ROS in cardiac myocytes are induced by two parallel pathways initiated at the plasma membrane: One being the ouabain-altered transient interactions of a fraction of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase with neighboring proteins (Src, growth factor receptors, adaptor proteins, and Ras) leading to ROS generation, and the other, inhibition of the transport function of another fraction of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase leading to rise in [Ca(2+)](i). Evidently, the gene regulatory effects of ouabain in cardiac myocytes require the downstream collaborations of ROS and [Ca(2+)](i)."
https://openalex.org/W2162369109,"Nontoxic concentrations of ouabain, causing partial inhibition of the cardiac myocyte Na 1 /K 1 -ATPase, induce hypertrophy and several growth-related genes through signal pathways that include the activation of Ras and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The aim of this work was to examine the ouabain-induced events upstream of the Ras/MAPK cascade. Treatment of myocytes with genistein antagonized ouabain-induced activation of the MAPK, suggesting that protein tyrosine phosphorylation has a role. Tyrosine phosphorylation of several myocyte proteins was increased rapidly upon cell exposure to ouabain. Lowering of extracellular K 1 had a similar ouabain-like effect. Ouabain also increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation in A7r5, HeLa, and L929 cells. In cardiac myocytes and A7r5 cells, herbimycin A antagonized the ouabain-induced increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK activation. In both cell types, ouabain stimulated Src kinase activity, Src translocation to the Triton-insoluble fraction, Src association with the epidermal growth factor receptor, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of this receptor on site(s) other than its major autophosphorylation site, Tyr 1173 . The findings suggest that (a) the ouabain-induced activation of Src and the Src-induced phosphorylation of the growth factor receptor provide the scaffolding for the recruitment of adaptor proteins and Ras and the activation of Ras/ MAPK cascade; and (b) the activation of such pathways may be a common feature of the signal-transducing"

We cloned the nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor-α(RXR-α) as an IGFBP-3 protein partner in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Multiple methodologies showed that IGFBP-3 and RXR-α bind each other within the nucleus. IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis was abolished in RXR-α-knockout cells. IGFBP-3 and RXR ligands were additive in inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. IGFBP-3 enhanced RXR response element and inhibited RARE signaling.

They modulate IGF action by inhibiting or potentiating IGF binding to the IGF receptor. There are six high-affinity IGFBPs, of which IGFBP-3 is the most abundant in serum (1Ferry J.R. Cerri R.W. Cohen P. Horm. Res. 1999; 51: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Circulating IGFBP-3 is derived mainly from hepatic Kupffer cells, primarily under regulation by growth hormone, but IGFBP-3 is also produced locally in many tissues, where it serves important paracrine and autocrine roles in modulating cellular growth (2Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells, IGFBP-3 is potently regulated by a number of factors including p53 (3Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-β (4Oh Y. Muller H.L. Ng L. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3915-3918PubMed Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 has been shown to directly induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (6Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25602-25607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and other cell types. In these instances, IGFBP-3 acts directly, independently of the IGF-IGF receptor system, by binding to its own receptor(s), the nature of which is currently being unraveled. The ability of IGFBP-3 to bind other molecules in addition to the IGFs has been previously demonstrated. IGFBP-3 binds to ALS, which together with IGF forms a stable ternary complex in serum (8Janosi J.B. Ramsland P.A. Mott M.R. Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Delhanty P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23328-23332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 can undergo post-translational modification by proteases and can form an intermediary complex with plasmin and related enzymes (9Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 27: E321-E331Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 is noted to have a heparin-binding domain in its mid-region and is known to interact with heparin-containing molecules in the extracellular matrix (10Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and with fibrin (11Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Hayes J.D. Suwanichkul A. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30215-30221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Several groups, including our own, have demonstrated specific binding of IGFBP-3 to other uncharacterized proteins in serum (12Collett-Solberg P.F. Nunn S.E. Beers-Gibson T. Cohen P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 2843-2850PubMed Google Scholar), cell lysates (13Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that IGFBP-3 may share a common receptor with transforming growth factor-β (14Leal S.M. Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20572-20576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It is of yet unclear what role these interactions play in mediating IGFBP-3 direct actions on cells. IGFBP-3 has been observed in the nucleus of certain cells and contains a nuclear localization sequence that may facilitate shuttling into nuclei (15Schedlich L.J. Young T.F. Firth S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18347-18352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 16Li W. Fawcett J. Widmer H.R. Fielder P.J. Rabkin R. Keller G.A.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1767-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The role of nuclear IGFBP-3 is currently unknown, but the cellular effects of IGFBP-3 appear to involve modulation of gene transcription, and thus, interactions of IGFBP-3 with transcription factors have been hypothesized. The retinoid X receptor-α (RXR-α) serves a key role in the regulation of gene transcription mediated by a variety of factors (18Solomin L. Johansson C.B. Zetterstrom R.H. Bissonnette R.P. Heyman R.A. Olson L. Lendahl U. Frisen J. Perlmann T. Nature. 1998; 395: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). RXR-α is an obligatory co-factor for the retinoic acid receptors, RARs (19Boylan J.F.

Nature. 1992; 355: 446-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). RXR-α can form heterodimers with these nuclear transcription factors and signal through specific DNA response elements such as the RARE, peroxisome proliferator receptor element, thyroid receptor element, and vitamin D receptor elements (23Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar), or form homodimers and signal through RXRE (24Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Lu X.P. Haefner P. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Science. 1992; 258: 1944-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The activity of these transcriptional dimers is further regulated by a variety of transcriptional co-activators and co-inhibitors that modulate gene transcription in various states (25Westin S. Kurokawa R. Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Milburn M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 395: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We report here the identification of a novel partner for IGFBP-3 in the form of the nuclear receptor RXR-α, confirm the validity of RXR-α/IGFBP-3 binding through multiple independent in vitro methods, and demonstrate physiologically significant consequences of RXR-α/IGFBP-3 binding on transcriptional signaling and cellular apoptosis. This unexpected interaction between the IGF/BP growth factor cascade and nuclear receptors represents a novel paradigm shift in our understanding of these systems. Protigen (Mountain View, CA) provided recombinant human IGFBP-3 and the NLS mutant IGFBP-3. Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Sweden) provided recombinant human IGF-I. Ligand (San Diego, CA) and SRI International (Menlo Park, CA) provided the RXR-specific ligands LG1069 and SR11235, respectively. These ligands bind the retinoid receptor X exclusively with maximal binding achieved at 1 μm (26Solomon C. White J.H. Kremer R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1729-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 125I-IGFBP-3 and anti-human IGFBP-3 antibodies, which were affinity purified on an IGFBP-3 column, were purchased from DSL (Webster, TX). Anti-human RXR-α antibodies, RAR antibodies, and HeLa nuclear extracts were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). IGFBP-3 blocking peptides were purchased from Genemed Synthesis (South San Francisco, CA). Retinoic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, and Igepal CA-630 were purchased from Sigma. Tris (crystallized free base) was purchased from Fisher (Fair Lawn, NJ). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) reagents, Tween, and fat-free milk were purchased from Bio-Rad. Yeast two-hybrid screening kits were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The HeLa cDNA library was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The yeast strainSaccharomyces cerevisiae HF7c (MATa, ura3-52,his3-200, lys2-801, ade2-101,trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4-542,gal80-538, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, URA3::(GAL417-mers)3-CYC1-lacZ)) was purchased fromCLONTECH. The fusion gene IGFBP-3/BD was constructed by splicing cDNA encoding the human IGFBP-3gene into the plasmid pGBT9 directly 5′ to and in-phase with the gene encoding the binding domain (BD) of the yeast transcriptional activatorGAL4 (CLONTECH). A HeLa cDNA library with the activation domain (AD) of the GAL4 gene was purchased from Stratagene and screened by co-transforming yeast with both plasmids. Yeast colonies were made competent for transformations according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH Matchmaker protocol handbook). Positive co-transformants were selected by growth on histidine-deficient agar media and assayed for β-galactosidase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH Matchmaker protocol handbook). All results were reproducible in at least two independent assays. Genes encoding IGFBP-3-binding proteins identified through this method were isolated by plasmid recovery, amplified using polymerase chain reaction, sequenced using the GAL4activation domain sequencing primer, and compared with known sequences in GeneBank using the MacVectorTM software program (Oxford Molecular Ltd., Williamstown, MA). IGFBP-3/BD was co-transformed with the candidate gene/AD construct into yeast, using the protocol for the two-hybrid system. The transformants were streaked on the SD agar plates without Leu and Trp or His, and incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. Expression of theLacZ gene by the co-transformants was determined by assaying for β-galactosidase activity,CLONTECH. Reverse Western ligand blots were used to assess the binding of IGFBP-3 to RXR-α. GST, GST-RXR-α, or IGF-I were carefully dot-blotted directly onto nitrocellulose (2 μl at a time) and allowed to dry completely. The nitrocellulose was buffered in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 3% Igepal CA-630 for 30 min. The membranes were blocked for 3 h with TBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and then incubated overnight with 125I-IGFBP-3 (106 cpm) in TBS, 0.1% Tween, 1% bovine serum albumin. In some experiments, the incubation was performed in the presence of peptides analogous to domains of the IGFBP-3 molecule. The peptides used included: 1) an N-terminal-domain 20-mer peptide, corresponding to amino acids 33–52 in the IGFBP-3 protein: TELVREPGCGCCLTCALREG. 2) A peptide corresponding the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) within the heparin-binding domain (HBD). This 18-mer peptide corresponded to amino acids 215–232 in the IGFBP-3 protein: KKGFYKKKQCRPSKGRKR. The nitrocellulose was washed four times with TBS, 0.1% Tween and TBS. Autoradiography and phosphorimaging visualized the resulting bands. Experiments were repeated three times. Values of densitometrically analyzed values are expressed as mean ± S.D. HeLa nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-RXR-α or anti-IGFBP-3 antibodies. Briefly, 250 μl of protein A-agarose were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μl of anti-human IGFBP-3 antibodies or 5 μl of anti-RXR-α antibodies. 125 μl of each antibody-treated protein A-agarose were added to 10 μg of HeLa nuclear extract and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with shaking. Immunoprecipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation and washed 3 times with 100 μl of SACI buffer. 200-μl sample buffer (×1) were added to each sample and vortexed vigorously. Samples were boiled and vortexed again to release protein-antibody complexes from the protein A-agarose. The protein A-agarose was then separated from the immunoprecipitated complexes by centrifugation. The supernatants were saved, and the immunoprecipated proteins were separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (8%) at constant voltage overnight, then transferred to nitrocellulose for 4 h at 170 mA. The nitrocellulose was immersed in blocking solution (5% non-fat milk/TBS) for 45 min, washed with TBS, 0.1% Tween, and incubated with primary anti-human RXR-α or anti-human IGFBP-3 antibody (1:4,000) for 2 h. After washing off any unbound antibodies, the nitrocellulose was incubated with a secondary antibody (1:10,000) for 1 h. The membrane was washed 4 times with TBS, 0.1% Tween and TBS. Bands were visualized using the peroxidase-linked enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Experiments were repeated three times. 125I-IGFBP-3 was incubated with 10 μg of HeLa nuclear extracts for 3 h at room temperature, and then with 5 μl of IGFBP-3, RXR-α, or RAR antibodies overnight. Complexes were then immunoprecipitated with protein A-agarose as above. Samples were subjected to separation on 12.5% nonreducing SDS-PAGE gel and autoradiography. Experiments were repeated three times. The GST-RXR fusion vector encoded the full-length RXR molecule and was the generous gift of Dr. D. J. Mangelsdorf and has been previously described (27Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar). GST-RXR-α fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coliDH5α, transformed with a GST - RXR-α construct, which were lysed and loaded on glutathione -Sepharose 4B beads from Sigma. 10 μg of purified GST-RXR-α bound to beads were incubated with 5 μg of recombinant IGFBP-3 protein or IGFBP-3 mutants and then separated by centrifugation. The bound proteins were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-IGFBP-3 antibody. Experiments were repeated three times. [γ-32P]ATP-labeled RXRE or RARE were incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts in 25 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, 36 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 10% glycerol at 25 °C for 20 min. Mixtures were incubated with or without IGFBP-3 or RXR-α antibodies for an additional 30 min. Incubations were carried out with or without unlabeled competitors as indicated. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probe on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TGE at 12 V/cm for 3 h, and visualized by autoradiography. Experiments were repeated three times. COS-7 cells, F9 embryonal carcinoma cells from ATCC, and F9 RXR-α −/− cells (28Clifford J.L. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 units of streptomycin/ml in a humidified environment with 5% CO2. PC-3 cells from ATCC were cultured in F12K medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin per ml in a humidified environment with 5% CO2. LAPC-4 cells (29Craft N. Shostak Y. Carey M. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Qumega), 1% l-glutamine, 1% R1181 (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). Cells grown in 24-well culture plates were transfected with the appropriate combination of expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 500 ng/plate. The transfection solution was removed after 6 h of transfection, and the cells were cultured for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with or without 1 μm retinoic acid or RXR ligand overnight. Cells were subjected to luciferase assays as described previously (30Glass C.K. Lipkin S.M. Devary O.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 697-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were expressed as the means and standard deviations of five identical wells. Luciferase reporter plasmid constructs contained either the DR1 RXRE (AGGTCA), or the DR5 RARE (AGTTCA) in a direct repeat separated by 5 nucleotides in the context of a thymidine kinase heterologous promoter, or a control plasmid containing the thymidine kinase promoter but no response element (TK-LUC) (31Lee H.Y. Dohi D.F. Kim Y.H. Walsh G.L. Consoli U. Andreeff M. Dawson M.I. Hong W.K. Kurie J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The full-length IGFBP3 cDNA was constructed in the expression vector (pKG3226) and co-transfected when indicated. Experiments were repeated three times. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Cells were plated at a starting density of 250 cells/well in 96-well plates and treated with varying doses of IGFBP-3 for 3 days. Cell number was determined as follows: the fluorescent dye calcein AM (1 mm) was added to the medium for 30 min prior to termination of the assay. The plate was then read on a Biolumen 960 fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The excitation and emission wavelengths are 485 and 530 nm, respectively, for calcein AM. The intensity of fluorescence of enzymatically cleaved calcein AM is a positive measure of cell number. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Photometric cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) was performed to quantitate the apoptotic index by detecting the histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) generated by the apoptotic cells. The assay is based on the quantitative sandwich-enzyme immunoassay principle using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against DNA and histones, respectively, for the specific determination of these nucleosomes in the cytoplasmic fraction of cell lysates. In brief, an equal number of LAPC-4 cells were plated in 24-well culture plates (1 × 104/cm2) in serum-supplemented medium, and grown to confluency for 72 h. At that time the confluent cells were washed with PBS and treated with IGFBP-3, an RXR ligand, and a combination thereof. The cells were dissociated gently (PBS with 0.1 m EDTA) and pelleted along with the floating cells (mostly apoptotic cells) collected from the conditioned media. The cell pellets were used to prepare the cytosol fractions, which contained the smaller fragments of DNA. Equal volumes of these cytosolic fractions were incubated in anti-histone antibody-coated wells (96-well plates) and the histones of the DNA fragments were allowed to bind to the anti-histone antibodies. The peroxidase-labeled mouse monoclonal DNA antibodies were used to localize and detect the bound fragmented DNA using photometric detection with 2,2′-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzathiazoline sulfonate) as the substrate. Calcium ionophore-treated conditions were used as positive controls. SFM-treated conditions were used as negative controls. Each experimental condition was performed with four samples and was repeated three times. The reaction products in each 96-well plate were read using a Bio-Rad microplate reader (model 3550-UV). Averages of the values ± S.D. from double absorbance measurements of the samples were plotted. 1 × 104 LAPC-4 cells were plated on coverglass in serum containing media for 2 days. The cells were then incubated in serum-free media with or without an RXR ligand (10−6m) for 24 h before staining for immunofluorescence. After three washes in PBS, fixation and permeabilization of the cells were performed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min on ice, and cells were washed twice with PBS. IGFBP-3 protein localization was detected using the DSL hIGFBP-3 goat polyclonal antibody (which was previously purified an IGFBP-3 column), diluted 1:200, followed by fluorescein anti-goat antibody from Vector (Burlingame, CA). RXR-α protein was detected using an RXR-α-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody, diluted 1:150, followed by Texas Red anti-rabbit IgG from Sigma. Specimens were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, with secondary antibodies in PBS for 40 min at room temperature, and then incubated with Hoechst from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Ft. Washington, PA) for 2 min. Samples were analyzed using the Inverted Confocal Microscope (Leica, Inc., Germany), equipped by digital camera Himamatsu (Japan), and operated by QED-image software. A yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify novel IGFBP-3 partners. We utilized the yeast strain Hf7c (which is unable to grow in histidine, leucine, or tryptophan-deficient media) with a histidine-selection marker and β-galactosidase marker under control by theGAL1 promoter. We performed co-transformations with: 1) pGBT9 plasmid containing the fusion gene IGFBP-3/GAL4 BD and a histidine-selection marker plus; 2) pGAD424 plasmid containing a HeLa cell cDNA library/GAL4 AD fusion gene and a tryptophan-selection marker. Positive co-transformants were isolated by growth on tryptophan-, leucine-, and histidine-deficient media, and colonies with β-galactosidase activity were harvested to recover library plasmids. Library fragments were amplified using PCR and sequenced. We isolated a 1200-base pair cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal portion of the human RXR-α gene followed by the 3′-untranslated region of the human RXR-α cDNA. Yeast mating experiments confirmed the interaction between IGFBP-3 and RXR-α and co-transfected colonies disclosed potent β-galactosidase activity, which was completely absent in single transformants or in co-transformations of either hybrid with an empty vector. TheRXR clone was one of 5 positive clones that reproducibly bound IGFBP-3 in the yeast two-hybrid screen. It was cloned out in four separate experiments. In order to investigate the specificity of RXR-α binding to IGFBP-3, we performed GST pull-down experiments using RXR-α linked to GST and various forms of IGFBP-3 proteins. GST-RXR-α was able to “pull-down” various forms of natural and recombinant IGFBP-3. As shown in Fig. 1, GST-RXR-α bound recombinant IGFBP-3 as well as the NLS mutant IGFBP-3, which has 2 amino acids mutated in the NLS region of IGFBP-3 (Table I). However, the IGFBP-3-HBD-BP1 mutant, in which 11 of the 18 amino acids in the HBD domain have been substituted to simulate the homologous region in IGFBP-1, which does not contain a heparin-binding domain (Table I), displayed no binding capacity for RXR-α. This suggests that RXR-α binding is specific to a region of IGFBP-3, which is within the HBD domain, but does not involve the NLS domain, which is part of it. In separate experiments, GST-RXR-α bound recombinant IGFBP-3 of both the glycosylated (Chinese hamster ovary-derived as well as baculovirus-derived) and non-glycosylated (E. coli-derived) forms, and also pulled-down serum, cell lysate, and conditioned media IGFBP-3 (data not shown). Reconstitution experiments with IGFBP-3 and the Sepharose beads indicated that less than 5% of the IGFBP-3 binds to the beads without RXR-GST being present.Table ISequences of IGFBP-3 mutantsWild type IGFBP-3215KKGFYKKKQCRPSKGRKR 232NLS mutant IGFBP-3215KKGFYKKKQCRPSEGCKR 232IGFBP-3-HBD-BP1215KNGFYHSRQCETSMDGEA 232Mutated residues are shown in bold. Amino acids 215–232 are commonly referred to the heparin-binding domain of IGFBP-3 (HBD) and contain the NLS. The IGFBP-3-HBD-BP1 mutant was engineered to contain the homologous sequence from IGFBP-1. The NLS mutant does not accumulate in the nucleus of cells (data not shown). The HBD mutant does not bind heparin (data not shown). Open table in a new tab Mutated residues are shown in bold. Amino acids 215–232 are commonly referred to the heparin-binding domain of IGFBP-3 (HBD) and contain the NLS. The IGFBP-3-HBD-BP1 mutant was engineered to contain the homologous sequence from IGFBP-1. The NLS mutant does not accumulate in the nucleus of cells (data not shown). The HBD mutant does not bind heparin (data not shown). Western ligand dot blot assays confirmed IGFBP-3 binding to RXR-α as shown in Fig. 2. Increasing amounts of GST, GST-RXR-α protein, and IGF-I were dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, then incubated with 125I-IGFBP-3 with or without peptides homologous to the N terminus of the IGFBP-3 protein, or the HBD domain of IGFBP-3. IGFBP-3 potently bound to both RXR-α and IGF-I to a similar degree as shown in the blot depicted in Fig. 2 A and in the phosphorimaged quantification in Fig.2 B. GST alone demonstrated no binding to IGFBP-3 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 A, there was no appreciable binding of IGFBP-3 to either human or bovine albumin nor to insulin. The N terminus peptide of IGFBP-3 blocked IGF-I binding, but had no effect on RXR-α binding (Fig. 2 B), whereas the HBD peptide blocked RXR-α binding, but had no effect on IGF-I binding to IGFBP-3 (Fig. 2 B). This indicates that RXR-α binds near the HBD domain of IGFBP-3, while IGF-I binding involves the N-terminal domain. In additional blots (data not shown) insulin, human albumin, and bovine albumin were dot blotted and probed with radiolabeled IGFBP-3 and showed no binding, indicating that RXR-IGFBP-3 binding is specific. In order to further investigate the specificity of RXR-α binding to IGFBP-3 in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In Fig. 3 A, we used anti-IGFBP-3 and anti-RXR-α antibodies to immunoprecipitate these proteins and any interacting molecules from HeLa nuclear extracts then precipitated the samples with protein A-agarose. After separating the proteins using SDS-PAGE, we immunoblotted the membranes with anti-human IGFBP-3 antibodies (left) and anti-human RXR-α antibodies (right). IGFBP-3 antibodies immunoprecipitated all of the IGFBP-3 in the nuclear extracts samples and 39 ± 11% of the RXR-α available in the nuclear extracts. RXR-α antibodies successfully precipitated all the RXR-α in nuclear extracts and more than 84 ± 17% of the IGFBP-3 in the nuclear extract samples. In Fig. 3 B, 125I-IGFBP-3 was incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts. Antibodies for IGFBP-3, RXR-α, or RAR were bound with protein A-agarose and then further incubated with the nuclear extract mixtures. After precipitation, proteins were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. Both the IGFBP-3 antibody and the RXR-α antibody precipitated a complex of 125I-IGFBP-3 and RXR-α, whereas an RAR antibody did not precipitate IGFBP-3. This indicates that the IGFBP-3 -RXR-α binding is specific and that IGFBP-3 only binds RXR homodimers in HeLa nuclear extracts but does not bind RXR-RAR heterodimers. Using fluorescence immunocytochemistry with antibodies for IGFBP-3 and RXR-α, confocal microscopy revealed that IGFBP-3 and RXR-α were present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of LAPC-4 cells (Fig.4) and PC-3 cells (data not shown). Moreover, IGFBP-3 and RXR-α co-localized to a high degree in both cellular compartments. Furthermore, after the cells were treated with the RXR ligand LG1069 for 24 h, cytoplasmic IGFBP-3 and RXR-α both translocated to the nucleus as shown in the lower panelof Fig. 4. Similar results were seen upon treatment with 9-cis-RA (data not shown). Fig.5 demonstrates the interactions of IGFBP-3 with the DNA-transcription factor complex involving RXR-α and the RXR response element (RXRE) in electromobility shift assays. HeLa nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled DR-1 RXRE, then separated by 4.5% polyacrylamide gel. Specific binding of RXR-α in HeLa nuclear extracts to the DR-1 RXRE was demonstrated inlanes 1–3. As expected, the addition of an RXR-α antibody in lane 8 supershi"
https://openalex.org/W2021878174,"Anethole, a chief constituent of anise, camphor, and fennel, has been shown to block both inflammation and carcinogenesis, but just how these effects are mediated is not known. One possibility is TNF-mediated signaling, which has also been associated with both inflammation and carcinogenesis. In the present report we show that anethole is a potent inhibitor of TNF-induced NF-κB activation (an early response) as monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, and NF-κB reporter gene expression. Suppression of IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB reporter gene expression induced by TRAF2 and NIK, suggests that anethole acts on IκBα kinase. Anethole also blocked the NF-κB activation induced by a variety of other inflammatory agents. Besides NF-κB, anethole also suppressed TNF-induced activation of the transcription factor AP-1, c-jun N-terminal kinase and MAPK-kinase. In addition, anethole abrogated TNF-induced apoptosis as measured by both caspase activation and cell viability. The anethole analogues eugenol and isoeugenol also blocked TNF signaling. Anethole suppressed TNF-induced both lipid peroxidation and ROI generation. Overall, our results demonstrate that anethole inhibits TNF-induced cellular responses, which may explain its role in suppression of inflammation and carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1973905761,"Scatter Factors control a complex genetic program known as 'invasive growth'. HGF (Scatter factor 1) and MSP (Scatter Factor 2) bind to tyrosine kinase receptors encoded by the proto-oncogenes MET and RON. Using the appropriate 'kinase inactive' mutant receptors, we show that ligand-induced activation of Met results in transphosphorylation of Ron, and vice versa. Transphosphorylation is direct, as it occurs in Met or Ron receptors lacking the docking sites for signal transducers. Phosphate groups are transferred to the tyrosine phosphorylation sites responsible both for kinase up-regulation (Met: Y1234/Y1235 and Ron: Y1238/Y1239) and for generation of signal transducer docking sites (Met: Y1349/Y1356 and Ron Y1353/Y1360). The transphosphorylation specifically takes place for the receptor subfamily, as it is not observed between Met or Ron and ErbB1, ErbB2 or TrkA. Cross-linking experiments show that non-covalent Met-Ron complexes are present on the cell surface, before ligand-induced dimerization. Co-expression of a kinase inactive Ron receptor with naturally-occurring oncogenic Met mutants suppresses the transforming phenotype, suggesting a dominant negative role for the inefficient kinase partner. These data show that, while specific for their ligands, scatter factor receptors cross-talk and cooperate in intracellular signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2130566610,"Early-onset torsion dystonia is an autosomal dominant hyperkinetic movement disorder that has recently been linked to a 3-base pair deletion in the DYT1 gene. TheDYT1 gene encodes a 332-amino acid protein, torsin A, that bears low but significant homology to the Hsp100/Clp family of ATPase chaperones. The deletion in DYT1 associated with torsion dystonia results in the loss of one of a pair of glutamic acid residues residing near the C terminus of torsin A (ΔE-torsin A). At present, little is known about the expression, subcellular distribution, and/or function of either the torsin A or ΔE-torsin A protein. When transfected into mammalian cells, both torsin A and ΔE-torsin A were found to behave as lumenally oriented glycoproteins. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that torsin A localized to a diffuse network of intracellular membranes displaying significant co-immunoreactivity for the endoplasmic reticulum resident protein BiP, whereas ΔE-torsin A resided in large spheroid intracellular structures exclusive of BiP immunoreactivity. These results initially suggested that ΔE-torsin A might exist as insoluble aggregates. However, both torsin A and ΔE-torsin A were readily solubilized by nonionic detergents, were similarly accessible to proteases, and displayed equivalent migration patterns on sucrose gradients. Collectively, these data support that both the wild type and torsion dystonia-associated forms of torsin A are properly folded, lumenal proteins of similar oligomeric states.

Bressman S.B. Marsden C.D. Adv. Neurol. 1998; 78: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with approximately 30% penetrance (2Risch N.J. Bressman S.B. deLeon D. Brin M.F. Burke R.E. Greene P.E. Shale H. Claus E.B. Cupples L.A. Fahn S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 533-538PubMed Google Scholar) and manifests itself as sustained muscle contractions that induce twisting and repetitive movements and/or abnormal posture. Symptoms usually begin in the arms or legs at a mean age of 12 years, exhibited as twisting contractions that spread to other limbs within 5 years (3Bressman S.B. de Leon M.S. Kramer P.L.

Movement Disorders. 1995; 10: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Torsion dystonia, also known as primary or idiopathic dystonia, is distinguished from other forms of dystonia by a lack of apparent additional neurological defects, with no loss of consciousness, intelligence, or perception being observed. No visible organic lesions can be ascribed as a causative agent for torsion dystonia, and there is an absence of any distinct neuropathology (5Fahn S. Adv. Neurol. 1988; 50: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hedreen J.C. Zweig R.M. DeLong M.R. Whitehouse P.J. Price D.L. Adv. Neurol. 1988; 50: 123-132PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies using positron emission tomography have identifiedDYT1 dystonia-associated alterations in regional brain metabolic patterns, even in patients without clinical manifestations of the disease (7Eidelberg D.

The gene responsible for early-onset torsion dystonia (DYT1) has recently been mapped to the human chromosome locus 9q34 and found by positional cloning to encode a putative ATP-binding protein, torsin A (8Ozelius L.J. Hewett J.W. Page C.E. Bressman S.B. Kramer P.L. Shalish C. de Leon D. Brin M.F. Raymond D. Corey D.P. Fahn S. Risch N.J. Buckler A.J. Gusella J.F. Breakefield X.O. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The causative mutation in torsion dystonia has been identified as a 3-base pair deletion (GAG) in the coding sequence ofDYT1, resulting in the deletion of one of a pair of glutamic acid residues near the C terminus of torsin A (glutamates 302 and 303; ΔE-torsin A). The torsion dystonia-associated GAG deletion inDYT1 seems to have occurred several independent times throughout history, appearing in both Ashkenazi Jewish and multiple non-Jewish populations (9Lebre A.-S. Durr A. Jedynak P. Ponsot G. Vidailhet M. Agid Y. Brice A. Brain. 1999; 122: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Valente E.M. Warner T.T. Jarman P.R. Mathen D. Fletcher N.A. Marsden C.D. Bhatia K.P. Wood N.W. Brain. 1998; 121: 2335-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homology searches with the torsin A protein sequence reveal that the protein possesses a putative ATP-binding domain and a potential N-terminal signal sequence. Torsin A also shares over 70% identity with a second human gene product termed torsin B, whose corresponding gene, DYT2, is found adjacent to DYT1 on chromosome 9 (8Ozelius L.J. Hewett J.W. Page C.E. Bressman S.B. Kramer P.L. Shalish C. de Leon D. Brin M.F. Raymond D. Corey D.P. Fahn S. Risch N.J. Buckler A.J. Gusella J.F. Breakefield X.O. Nat.

Genet. 1997; 17: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar), suggesting that this protein family is ubiquitously expressed. The human torsins have clear homologues in rat, mouse, andCaenorhabditis elegans (four torsin-related gene products are predicted to exist in C. elegans), whereasSaccharomyces cerevisiae lacks torsin-like proteins. Additionally, the torsins show low but significant homology to the HSP100/Clp family of ATP-dependent chaperones (11Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 12Wawrzynow A. Banecki B. Zylicz M. Mol.

These distant relatives to the torsin family are cytosolic proteins noted for their ability to disassemble higher order protein structures and aggregates (14Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), confer increased tolerance to high temperature (15Sanchez Y. Lindquist S.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1112-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), and promote specific proteolysis (16Hoskins J.R. Pak M Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12135-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The HSP100/Clp proteins bind ATP and/or have ATPase activity, often functioning as nucleotide-stabilized oligomeric complexes with other companion proteins (17Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Maurizi M.R. Singh S.K. Thompson M.W. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7778-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Torsin A is 25–30% identical to several HSP100/Clp family members over a 140-amino acid domain that contains the putative ATP-binding cassette of the protein. Additionally, multiple key residues in the IV and SN domains of the HSP100/Clp proteins are also conserved in torsin A (11Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Because torsins contain only one predicted ATP-binding domain, these proteins would be classified as Class 2-type HSP100/Clp subfamily members (11Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The intriguing observation that a complex and debilitating neurobiological disease is linked to a single amino acid deletion in a putative protein of unknown structure or function motivated us to investigate the biochemical and cell biological features of both torsin A and its disease-inducing mutant form, ΔE-torsin A. These studies were in turn anticipated to provide a molecular framework upon which models could be constructed to describe the endogenous function(s) of torsin A, as well as the mode of pathological action of ΔE-torsin A. The cDNA for human torsin A was obtained as follows. ESTs covering portions of the torsin A cDNA were identified by BLAST searches and purchased (Research Genetics). These partial clones were then internally radiolabeled with [α32-P]CTP (Multiprime DNA Labeling Kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as probes to screen human brain and liver 5′ Stretch Plus cDNA libraries (CLONTECH); screens and phage DNA isolation were conducted according to manufacturer's guidelines. A single human liver clone was isolated that contained the complete torsin A cDNA sequence as well as an additional internal intronic sequence. Polymerase chain reaction was used to generate a contiguous torsin A construct by amplification of the two surrounding exonic regions and ligation of these two halves to create a complete torsin A cDNA possessing a single silent mutation (generating an internalBspEI site). The complete torsin A cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 and pFLAG eukaryotic expression vectors, and both strands of the cDNA were sequenced completely. A cDNA encoding the ΔE-torsin A protein was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quickchange procedure (Stratagene) (primer 1, 5′-GCAGAGTGGCTGAGATGACATTTTTCCC-3′; primer 2, 5′-GGGAAAAATGTCATCTCAGCCACTCTGC-3′). The ΔE-torsin A cDNA was sequenced completely and contained only the desired 3-base pair deletion. The torsin A cDNA was subcloned into the TrcHisC vector (Invitrogen) for generation of a torsin A His-tagged fusion protein (residues 61–332 of torsin A), which was expressed exclusively as inclusion bodies inEscherichia coli. The His-tagged torsin A was purified from inclusion bodies by SDS-PAGE1and used for antigen. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against the His-tagged torsin A protein were affinity purified by binding to Immobilon P transfer membrane (Millipore)-bound His-tagged torsin A. The membrane was washed three times with TBS/Tween (200 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris, and 0.1% Tween 20) and once with water. Specific antibodies were eluted with elution buffer (100 mmglycine, 50 mm Tris, pH 2.5), and the elution fractions were immediately neutralized with 12% volume of neutralizing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 9). COS-7 and HEK-293 cells (100-mm plates) were transiently transfected at approximately 80% confluency with either the torsin A or ΔE-torsin A cDNA in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 as described previously (19Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by trypsinization. After detachment, the cells were pelleted, washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, with 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were lysed by passage through a 23-gauge needle 20 times to generate total cell extracts (further processed as described below). Stably transfected cell lines expressing either torsin A or ΔE-torsin A were obtained from transient transfection of HEK-293 cells with the appropriate expression plasmid (pcDNA3 containing the neo antibiotic resistance gene and either the torsin A or ΔE-torsin A cDNA) and subsequent selection of colonies resistant to G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell lines were checked for torsin protein expression by immunofluorescence and by Western blotting. COS-7 and HEK-293 cells were grown on 11 × 22-mm coverslips to approximately 35% confluency and then transiently transfected as described previously (20Giang D.K. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2238-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Coverslips used for HEK-293 cells were treated with 0.1 mm poly-d-lysine. Following transfection, the coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed in methanol for 5 min at −20 °C. After fixation, the coverslips were washed with PBS and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. The blocking solution was removed, and the coverslips were then incubated with rabbit anti-torsin A antibodies and mouse anti-BiP antibodies (anti-KDEL antibodies, StressGen) in blocking solution for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were then incubated with Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) and Alexa 568-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) in blocking solution for 1 h. The coverslips were washed with PBS to remove excess goat antibody, and the coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with SloFade (Molecular Probes). The slides were viewed on a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV/Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal microscopy system. Total cell extracts were fractionated to provide cell microsomes as follows. Extracts were centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed and re-centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant and pellet from the second spin were considered the cytosolic and microsomal fractions, respectively. The 100,000 ×g pellet was reconstituted in 200 μl of buffer A with protease inhibitors by passing through a 23-gauge needle 10 times. The protein concentration for each fraction was determined (Dcprotein assay kit, Bio-Rad), and 50 μg of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting procedures. All SDS-PAGE protein samples were incubated with an equal volume of 2× loading buffer (125 mm Tris (pH 6.75), 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue) and heated for 5 min at 90 °C prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. Confluent plates (250 mm) were harvested by trypsinization. After detachment, cells were pelleted, washed once with 1 ml of PBS, and resuspended in buffer A (800 μl per plate). Cells were lysed by passage through a 23-gauge needle 20 times. The cell extract was then spun at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant removed and re-centrifuged at 15,000 × 104 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was gently resuspended in 260 μl of buffer C (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, with 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 250 mmsucrose, 0.1 m NaCl) and incubated with shaking at 4 °C for 15 min. The resuspended microsomes (67.5 μl) were treated with 7.5 μl of either buffer C, 10% digitonin (Wako Chemical) in buffer C, or 10% Triton X-100 in buffer C. These solutions were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Each 75-μl sample was then split in thirds, and one-third of the sample was treated with 1 μl of either buffer C, trypsin (Calbiochem, 0.8 μg; ∼50 μg of trypsin per mg of microsomal protein) in buffer C, or α-chymotrypsin (Sigma, 1.6 μg; ∼100 μg of chymotrypsin per mg of microsomal protein) in buffer C. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor (Sigma, 0.2 μg, Bowman-Birk inhibitor) and SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting procedures. HEK-293 microsomes (50 μl) were centrifuged at 100,000 × g,and the pellet was resuspended in denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) with a 23-gauge needle. The fractions were denatured at 100 °C for 15 min, treated with PNGase F according to manufacturer's specifications (New England Biolabs), and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting techniques. cDNAs encoding the glycosylation mutants, N143Q and N158Q, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quickchange procedure (Stratagene). HEK-293 microsomes derived from mock, torsin A, and ΔE-torsin A transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h. The supernatants (150 μl) were applied to 3–12% linear sucrose gradients (12 ml; 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100). The sucrose gradients were then centrifuged at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C for 17 h in an SW40 Ti rotor (Beckman). Fractions were removed from the top of the gradient in 1-ml aliquots and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid using bovine serum albumin (50 μg) as an aid for precipitation. All fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In order to generate reagents to detect the expression of torsin A and ΔE-torsin A in mammalian cells, rabbit anti-torsin polyclonal antibodies were raised against a fragment of the torsin A protein recombinantly expressed in E. coli (amino acids 61–332). The cDNAs for torsin A and ΔE-torsin A were subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector and transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells. Transfected cell extracts were probed with anti-torsin antibodies, and both torsin A and ΔE-torsin A-transfected cells, but not mock-transfected cells (transfected with the pcDNA3 vector alone), showed a strong immunoreactive band near the predicted molecular size of the torsins (38 kDa) (Fig.1 A). Torsin A and ΔE-torsin A were expressed to similar levels in these transfected cell populations. An immunoreactive band of equivalent molecular size to torsin A was also observed in mock-transfected cells but only upon much longer exposures (see below), indicating that HEK-293 cells express low levels of endogenous torsin A. A single cross-reactive protein of approximately 100 kDa was observed in both mock- and torsin-transfected cells, possibly representing a protein of the HSP100 family of heat shock proteins, which display low level homology to torsins (8Ozelius L.J. Hewett J.W. Page C.E. Bressman S.B. Kramer P.L. Shalish C. de Leon D. Brin M.F. Raymond D. Corey D.P. Fahn S. Risch N.J. Buckler A.J. Gusella J.F. Breakefield X.O. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Complementary efforts to generate epitope-tagged forms of torsin A revealed that addition of either an N- or C-terminal tag dramatically altered the stability of torsin A, with an N-terminal FLAG-torsin A appearing as several bands by Western analysis and a C-terminal Myc-torsin A failing to express to detectable levels (data not shown). Both torsin A and ΔE-torsin A segregated exclusively with particulate fractions of HEK-293 cells, appearing in the 100,000 ×g cell pellet but not in the 100,000 × gsupernatant (Fig. 1 B). In order to evaluate in more detail the subcellular localization of the torsins, immunofluorescence light microscopy studies were conducted on mammalian cells transfected with the torsin cDNAs. In HEK-293 cells, torsin A was found to reside on an intracellular membrane network that displayed significant overlapping immunoreactivity with the ER resident protein BiP (21Haas I.G. Experientia ( Basel ). 1994; 50: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). Torsin A immunoreactivity was also observed in the nuclear envelope, a region void of BiP signals. A low level of additional immunoreactivity was sometimes observed in the nucleus, but this signal was found in mock-transfected cells as well and thus not likely attributable to the expressed torsin A protein. In sharp contrast to the subcellular distribution of torsin A, ΔE-torsin A localized to large, spheroid intracellular structures that were exclusive of BiP immunoreactivity (Fig. 2 B). In order to evaluate whether the dramatically different subcellular localizations of torsin A and ΔE-torsin A represented a cell type-specific phenomenon, the distributions of these proteins were examined in transfected COS-7 cells. As was observed in the HEK-293 cells, COS-expressed torsin A was found on a diffuse intracellular network of membranes that also displayed significant BiP immunoreactivity (Fig. 2 C). However, ΔE-torsin A was again found as a constituent of large intracellular structures that lacked evidence of BiP co-localization (Fig. 2 D). Intriguingly, the ΔE-torsin A-immunoreactive structures sometimes appeared as hollow circles (Fig. 2 E), perhaps suggesting that this intracellular structure represented a tubulovesicular membrane compartment (see “Discussion”). Collectively, these results indicate that torsin A and ΔE-torsin A display distinct distributions in mammalian cells, with the former protein exhibiting properties consistent with those of a resident of the ER, and the latter protein localizing to a distinct intracellular membrane structure. In order to confirm that the cellular and biochemical phenotypes observed for the torsin proteins were not due to artifacts associated with transient transfection, we generated lines of stably transfected HEK-293 cells expressing either form of the torsin protein. Immunofluorescence analysis of multiple stably transfected clones identified numerous torsin A and ΔE-torsin A-transfected lines that expressed significant levels of torsin protein (depending on the clone, 50–100% of the cell population expressed torsin protein). Notably, the different subcellular localizations of the wild type and ΔE-torsin A proteins observed originally in transiently transfected cells were preserved in the stably transfected HEK lines (Fig.3). In these stable lines, the ΔE-torsin A protein was again found to reside in a compartment distinct and apparently nonoverlapping with the torsin A/BiP compartment. Although the aforementioned data from subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence studies supported that both torsin A and ΔE-torsin A were localized to intracellular membrane compartments, further biochemical evidence was sought to address whether these proteins were cytosolically or lumenally oriented in their respective topologies. Toward this end, we evaluated the protease sensitivities of the two proteins in the absence and presence of nonionic detergents. Two different proteases (trypsin and α−chymotrypsin) and detergents (Triton X-100 and digitonin) were utilized in their various permutations for this study, as previous reports have called attention to the potential artifacts associated with single detergent-protease analyses (e.g. the unveiling of a cryptic protease-sensitive site in a cytosolic protein by a particular detergent; Refs. 22Coleman R.A. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 595: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and 23Depierre J.W. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 415: 411-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Both torsin A (Fig.4 A) and ΔE-torsin A (Fig.4 B) were sensitive to either trypsin or α-chymotrypsin digestion in the presence of either Triton X-100 or digitonin (Fig. 4,A and B, lower panels) but not in the absence of detergents. The selective protease sensitivity of the ER lumenal protein grp94 in the presence of these detergents confirmed the integrity of the microsomal preparations under study (Fig. 4,A and B, upper panels) (24Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These data support a lumenal orientation for both torsin A and ΔE-torsin A. To achieve further support for the lumenal orientation of the torsin proteins, their respective glycosylation states were investigated. After incubation in the presence PNGase F, both torsin A and ΔE-torsin A showed increased mobilities on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 A), consistent with these proteins possessing N-linked carbohydrate modifications. Overexposure of the anti-torsin A Western blot identified that the endogenous torsin A protein in the HEK cells was similarly glycosylated (Fig. 5 B). Examination of the primary structure of torsin A identified two potential N-linked glycosylation sites (matching the consensus sequence NX(T/S)), Asn-143 and Asn-158. In order to evaluate whether Asn-143 and/or Asn-158 were glycosylated in torsin A, these residues were individually replaced with glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis. Both Asn to Gln mutants migrated as proteins of intermediate molecular size relative to torsin A and its PNGase F-treated form (Fig. 5 C), indicating that both of the NX(S/T) sites of torsin A are glycosylated in vivo. In further support of this notion, subsequent treatment of each Asn to Gln mutant with PNGase F reduced the protein to the molecular size of PNGase F-treated wild type torsin A (Fig.5 C). Collectively, these results support that both torsin A and ΔE-torsin A are lumenally oriented glycoproteins modified by carbohydrate on both Asn-143 and Asn-158. The identification of ΔE-torsin A as a constituent of large, spheroid intracellular structures initially raised suspicions that the protein might be misfolded and by default accumulating as intracellular aggregates. However, both torsin A and ΔE-torsin A were solubilized to near completion in the presence of the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 (Fig.6 A), suggesting that neither protein was grossly misfolded. Subsequent sucrose gradient sedimentation analyses revealed that torsin A and ΔE-torsin A were of similar oligomeric sizes in solution (Fig. 6 B). Both torsin proteins displayed a relatively broad migration pattern on 3–12% sucrose gradients with apparently two peaks of immunoreactivity occurring at around 5 and 7.5 S, respectively. Although theses values are consistent with dimeric and tetrameric forms of the torsins, further biophysical studies are required to assess with confidence the absolute oligomeric states of these proteins. Nonetheless, the respective migration patterns of torsin A and ΔE-torsin A clearly support that these proteins are similar at the level of quaternary structure. A major breakthrough in our understanding of the molecular basis for early-onset torsion dystonia was recently achieved with the linkage of this dominantly inherited disease to a 3-base pair deletion (GAG) in the DYT1 gene (8Ozelius L.J. Hewett J.W. Page C.E. Bressman S.B. Kramer P.L. Shalish C. de Leon D. Brin M.F. Raymond D. Corey D.P. Fahn S. Risch N.J. Buckler A.J. Gusella J.F. Breakefield X.O. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Several additional genetic studies have since greatly strengthened the association of this mutation with torsion dystonia (9Lebre A.-S. Durr A. Jedynak P. Ponsot G. Vidailhet M. Agid Y. Brice A. Brain. 1999; 122: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Valente E.M. Warner T.T. Jarman P.R. Mathen D. Fletcher N.A. Marsden C.D. Bhatia K.P. Wood N.W. Brain. 1998; 121: 2335-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DYT1 gene product, torsin A, is a predicted 338-amino acid protein that displays distant homology to the HSP100/Clp family of ATP-dependent chaperones. The torsion dystonia-associated mutation in DYT1results in the deletion of a single glutamic acid residue residing near the C terminus of torsin A (ΔE-torsin A). To characterize comparatively torsin A and ΔE-torsin A, we have examined these proteins in transfected mammalian cells using a variety of biochemical and cell biological techniques. Both torsin A and ΔE-torsin A were found to partition with cell membrane fractions and behave as lumenally oriented glycoproteins. On this note, a comparison of the primary structures of the six known torsin family members (two mammalian and four C. elegans proteins) reveals that these proteins share exactly six conserved cysteine residues. In contrast, these cysteines are not present in other Hsp100/Clp proteins, suggesting that these residues may form disulfide bonds important for the tertiary structure of the torsin proteins. To our knowledge, torsin A represents the first identified lumenal member of the Hsp100/Clp family, indicating that this class of ATP-binding proteins has evolved to function in both oxidizing and reducing cellular environments. Further biochemical studies of torsin A and ΔE-torsin A determined that both proteins possess N-linked carbohydrate appendages, with each of two consensus NX(T/S) glycosylation sites being modified (Asn-143 and Asn-158). Interestingly, only one of these glycosylation sites is present in the torsin B protein, indicating that at least one difference between the highly homologous torsin A and B proteins (greater than 70% sequence identity) is their respective patterns of glycosylation. Immunofluorescence studies revealed a major difference in the respective subcellular localizations of torsin A and ΔE-torsin A. In either HEK-293 or COS-7 cells, torsin A displayed a diffuse staining pattern indicative of distribution on intracellular membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. Consistent with this notion, significant overlap was found between torsin A signals and those of the resident ER protein BiP. In contrast, ΔE-torsin A was localized to large, spheroid intracellular structures that lacked BiP immunoreactivity. We were initially concerned that the distribution of ΔE-torsin A might reflect aggregates of misfolded protein. However, the ΔE-torsin A protein was readily solubilized by the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and displayed a migration pattern on sucrose gradients indistinguishable from that of the wild type torsin A protein. Both torsin A and ΔE-torsin A migrated as diffuse proteins with s values ranging between 4 and 8.5. These molecular sizes indicate that the torsin proteins exist as multiple oligomeric species in solution, with peaks of torsin immunoreactivity occurring at 5 and 7.5 S, respectively. Although it remains to be determined whether these torsin species represent homo- or hetero-oligomers, a dynamic nature for torsin self-assembly would be consistent with the properties displayed by other Hsp100/Clp family members, which often show dramatic ATP-induced shifts in both their homo- and heterotypic interactionsin vitro (17Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Maurizi M.R. Singh S.K. Thompson M.W. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7778-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Considering further the altered subcellular distribution observed for ΔE-torsin A, one potential concern is our reliance on transfected cells in which the torsin proteins have been significantly overexpressed. Whether ΔE-torsin A would display this distinct localization in cells in which the protein was expressed at endogenous levels remains uncertain. At present, our antibody reagents lack sufficient sensitivity to detect by immunofluorescence microscopy the low quantities of endogenous torsin A found in the HEK-293 cells (although we were able to visualize endogenous torsin A by Western analysis; see Fig. 4 B). However, the localization of ΔE-torsin A to a distinct subcellular compartment was clearly not cell type-specific, as the protein displayed indistinguishable localizations in both HEK-293 and COS-7 cells. Additionally, the subcellular distributions of both N-linked glycosylation mutants of torsin A were examined, and both proteins displayed localizations equivalent to that of wild type torsin A (data not shown), indicating that the altered distribution of ΔE-torsin A was a special feature of this mutant protein. Finally, considering that the biochemical properties of ΔE-torsin A were indistinguishable from those of the wild type protein (including their respective topologies, glycosylation states, protease sensitivities, detergent solubilities, and oligomerization states), our data clearly argue against ΔE-torsin A being a grossly misfolded protein product. Instead, we hypothesize that the single amino acid deletion found in ΔE-torsin A may subtly alter the conformation of this protein in a manner that drives its relocalization to a distinct subcellular compartment. The precise identity of this ΔE-torsin A-containing cellular structure is presently unknown, and future studies will seek to identify additional proteins that co-localize with ΔE-torsin A. In summary, the comparative characterization of torsin A and ΔE-torsin A described in this study provides the first insights into the biochemical and cell biological properties of these proteins. When evaluated in the context of the homology of torsin A to members of the Hsp100/Clp family of chaperone proteins, models emerge to describe the potential endogenous function of this protein. For example, the identification of torsin A as a lumenally associated glycoprotein localized to intracellular membranes of the ER and nuclear envelope indicates that this protein may serve as a molecular chaperone assisting in the proper folding of secreted and/or membrane proteins. As for how ΔE-torsin A acts as a dominant disease-inducing protein, several molecular mechanisms seem possible. ΔE-torsin A may 1) sequester torsin A in inactive complexes, thus acting as a dominant negative; 2) behave as a constitutively active torsin A, thus acting as a dominant positive; and/or 3) possess novel functionality distinct from the normal biological roles of torsin A. In any of these models, ΔE-torsin A would likely need to exist as a folded and at least partially functional protein product, and our work to date supports this. Additionally, the mislocalization of ΔE-torsin A to a distinct subcellular compartment could support either a gain of function or dominant negative mode of action, the latter possibility likely depending on the ability of this protein to form hetero-oligomers with wild type torsin A. On this note, initial attempts to evaluate the interactions between ΔE-torsin A and torsin A have been hampered by an inability to N- or C-terminally epitope tag these proteins. Future efforts will focus on epitope tagging torsins internally on the C-terminal side of their predicted signal sequences. Finally, it remains unclear why a mutation in a protein product of apparently broad tissue distribution would produce a neurobiological disease with relatively low penetrance. Considering thatDYT1-associated dystonia lacks the visible neuropathologies associated with other neurodegenerative diseases, one possibility is that a more general cell biological defect underlies torsion dystonia. In this regard, a potential chaperone function for torsin A might be compatible with mutations in this protein inducing a low penetrance, tissue-restricted disease, as defects in other ubiquitously expressed chaperones have been found to produce a variety of specific disease states depending on the genetic and environmental backgrounds in which they occur (25Ozelius L.J. Hewett J.W. Page C.E. Bressman S.B. Kramer P.L. Shalish C. de Leon D. Brin M.F. Raymond D. Corey D.P. Fahn S. Risch N.J. Buckler A.J. Gusella J.F. Breakefield X.O. Adv. Neurol. 1998; 78: 93-105PubMed Google Scholar). In such a model, a GAG deletion in the DYT1gene would increase an individual's susceptibility to a “second hit” brought on by either genetic or environmental variables (26Rutherford S.L. Lindquist S. Nature. 1998; 396: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). Perhaps in the presence of this second hit, ΔE-torsin A expression becomes most debilitating in the context of the neuron, a cell type whose special cell biological properties may lend it enhanced susceptibility to an aberrant function of torsin A.

Membrane attachment is a prerequisite for phosphorylation by PDK1/2, which leads to complete PKB activation and protects active PKB against dephosphorylation and inactivation by cytosolic phosphatases. In addition to the PI-3K-mediated activation of PKB, PI-3K-independent activation has been reported. Examples are osmotic or thermic stress, treatments that raise cAMP, or the addition of okadaic acid (11Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Kuroda S. Ono Y. Kikkawa U.

PKB consists of an N-terminally located pleckstrin homology domain linked to a centrally located catalytic domain, which is connected to a short C-terminal tail. The catalytic domain displays high homology to the catalytic domains of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (65%) and protein kinase C (PKC; 75%) and contains a Thr308 phosphorylation site. A second phosphorylation site is Ser473, which is located in the C-terminal tail (13Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell F.B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). The PKB subtypes differ with respect to these phosphorylation sites, which are Thr308/Ser473 in PKBα and Thr309/Ser474 in PKBβ. Due to a C-terminal truncation, PKBγ has only one phosphorylation site (Thr305) (14Konishi H. Kuroda S. Tanaka M. Matsuzaki H. Ono Z. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Substitution of Thr308 or Ser473 for Asp by site-directed mutagenesis abolishes the activation of PKBα, suggesting that phosphorylation of both residues is required for full enzyme activity (13Alessi D.R.

The PtdIns(3,4)P2/PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent kinase PDK1 was shown to phosphorylate Thr308 of PKBα (15Konishi H. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Overexpression of PDK1 did not result in phosphorylation of Ser473, illustrating that the phosphorylation status of Ser473 is independent of Thr308. The kinase that controls Ser473 is still obscure but has been tentatively defined as PDK2. A first candidate for PDK2 is mitogen-activating kinase protein kinase kinase 2, which phosphorylates PKB in vitro (13Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell F.B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P.

A second is integrin-linked kinase-1, which phosphorylates PKB at Ser473 in a PI-3K-dependent manner (17Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Earlier studies favored the model in which PKB activation exclusively involves heterologous phosphorylation at both activation sites via “third party” kinases located upstream of PKBα. This was concluded from mutational studies in which an exchange of Thr308 to Asp resulted in an increased PKB activity level without inducing phosphorylation of Ser473 and vice versa (8Alessi D.R.

Furthermore, a kinase-inactive, membrane-targeted PKBα mutant was phosphorylated in L6 cells stimulated with insulin (18Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.F. Han J.H. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). A recent publication, however, suggests that PKB is activated by autophosphorylation at the Ser473 site (19Toker A. Newton A.C J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This model describes a two-step activation process of PKB. The initial phosphorylation occurs in the activation loop on Thr308 by PDK1 and consequently triggers phosphorylation on the Ser473 site by autophosphorylation; the postulated “third party” PDK2 kinase is thus elusive. Stimulation of blood platelets with α-thrombin triggers formation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 (20Zhang J. Benovic J.L. Sugai M. Wetzkar R. Gout I. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol.

The formation of these products is biphasic, showing a rapid accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3and a delayed rise in PtdIns(3,4)P2. Also, the activation of PKB is biphasic, suggesting that the first wave is triggered by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and the second by PtdIns(3,4)P2(22Banfic H Downes P. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11630-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). So far, there is little insight into the mechanisms that couple these changes to PKB. In the present study, we set out to explore the activation of PKB in platelets in more detail, giving special emphasis to the dual phosphorylation of the enzyme by the upstream kinases. The RT-PCR shows that platelets contain mainly PKBα. Using site-specific antibodies against phosphorylated Ser473(Ser(P)473) and phosphorylated Thr308 (Thr(P)308) on PKBα, we demonstrate that among the many platelet-activating agents tested, only α-thrombin and thrombopoietin (TPO) induce phosphorylation and activation of PKBα. The activation by α-thrombin involves a PI-3K independent pathway mediated via Ca2+-ions and PKC, indicating that a Ca2+-dependent PKC subtype regulates the PDK2-dependent PKB activation. Indomethacin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), α-thrombin, TPO, and Ponceau S were obtained from Sigma. The PAR1-specific (SFLLRN) and PAR4-specific (GYPGKF) activation peptides were from BioSynthesis (Lewisville, TX). Protifar was supplied by Nutricia, (Zoetermeer, The Netherlands). 1-(6-(17β-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl (U73122), 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002), Gö6976, and 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM) were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA).

(Beverly, MA) provided the PKBα-specific antibodies phospho-Akt-Ser473 and phospho-Akt-Thr308 and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The antibodies recognizing phosphorylated as well as nonphosphorylated PKBα, -β, and -γ were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). An antibody generated against the phosphorylated Thr641 in the turn motif of PKCβII, which cross-reacts with the phosphorylated Thr450 of PKB, enhanced chemiluminescence reagent, and the Kodak X-Omat blue x-ray films were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Nitrocellulose (Optitran BA-S 85) was obtained from Schleicher & Schuell. Protein A-Sepharose beads were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. The PKBα Immunoprecipitation Kinase Assay Kit was supplied by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Dynabeads-M450 CD50 were obtained from Dynal (Oslo, Norway). All chemicals had a purity of more than 98%. Venous blood was collected from medication-free volunteers (with informed consent) in 13 mmtrisodium citrate (final concentration). The blood was centrifuged (200 × g, 10 min at 20 °C) to yield platelet-rich plasma. Washed platelets were obtained by centrifugation of the platelet-rich plasma (200 × g, 10 min at 20 °C), supplied with 1.5% citric acid, 2.5% trisodium citrate, 2%d-glucose and (5Z,13E,15S)-6,9α-epoxy-11α,15-dihydroxyprosta-5,13-dien-1-oic acid, sodium salt (10 ng/ml) to prevent preactivation during the washing procedure. Platelets were resuspended in HEPES/Tyrode buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.0 mmMgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) containing 5 mm glucose and adjusted to 2 × 1011platelets/liter. Prior to the experiments, platelets were left to rest at room temperature for 30 min. Gel-filtered platelets were prepared as described earlier (23Hers I. Donath J. van Willigen G. Akkerman J.W.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed on indomethacin-treated platelets to exclude involvement of thromboxane A2. Therefore, platelets were preincubated with 30 nm indomethacin (15 min, room temperature) prior to stimulation. Dose-response studies for PKB phosphorylation in platelets stimulated with α-thrombin, TPO, and PMA were performed with 160 μl of platelet suspension incubated for 10 min at room temperature without stirring. The reaction was stopped by adding 40 μl of a 5-fold concentrated sample buffer (625 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 5% SDS, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% bromphenol blue). The samples were mixed and stored on ice. For the determination of time courses, 2 ml of platelet suspension was stimulated as described, and samples of 160 μl were drawn. Experiments in the presence of bisindolylmaleimide I (5 μm), LY294002 (10 μm), Gö6976 (10 μm), and BAPTA-AM (10 μm/30 μm), reflect data obtained after a 5-min preincubation with inhibitors at room temperature. Both agonists and enzyme modulators were added from 100-fold concentrated stock solutions; incubation conditions reflect final concentrations. In order to identify the distribution of the PKB isoenzymes (PKBα, -β, and -γ) in platelets, the following degenerated oligonucleotide primers from conserved regions of human PKB (α, positions 262–282 and 1043–1063; β, positions 121–141 and 935–975; γ, positions 63–83 and 835–975) were used: 5′-CTGG(C/A)GGCCA(C/A)G(C/G/A)TACTTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CC(G/A)TC(C/T)TTGTCCAGCAT(G/T)AG-3′ (antisense). The resulting PCR product was 665 bp. The common 5′-primer for all PKB subtypes was 5′-CT(C/A)ATGCTGGACAA(G/A)GA(C/T)GG-3′ and, depending on the isoenzyme, 5′-CCACGTCCTGCCAGTTGATG-3′ (PKBα), 5′-GTGCTGCCACACGATACCGG-3′ (PKBβ), and 5′-CCATGCAGTCCATACCATCC-3′ (PKBγ). Resulting PCR products were 354 bp (PKBα), 384 bp (PKBβ), and 500 bp (PKBγ). mRNA was obtained from gel-filtered human platelets using the MACS mRNA isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) and reverse transcribed using the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Platelets were depleted from leukocytes using Dynabeads-M450 CD50 according to the manufacturer's instruction. Before RT-PCR was performed, platelet cDNA was screened for contaminating cDNA derived from leukocytes. This control was performed by RT-PCR using primers against a leukocyte-specific surface marker (24van Willigen G. Donath J. Lapetina E.G. Akkerman J.W.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar): HLA-DQb5, 5′-GTCTCAATTATGTCTTGGAA-3′ (sense); HLA-DQb3, 5′-GCCACTCAGCATCTTGCT-3′ (antisense). The resulting PCR product was 702 bp. Platelet cDNA was considered leukocyte-free when no PCR product was amplified from platelet cDNA with HLA-DQb3/b5 primers after 35 PCR cycles. For amplification of genes encoding PKBα, -β, and -γ, 50 ng of platelet cDNA was used as a template. As positive control for the PKBγ primers, cDNA from human thymus (CLONTECH) was used as a template. Amplification was carried out as described earlier (25Rössler P. Kroner C.I. Freitag J. Noé J. Breer H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 253-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was performed in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, with a 200 μm concentration of each dNTP, 100 pmol of each primer, and 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The following PCR protocol was performed with all primers: 94 °C for 2 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 5 min (1 cycle); 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 40 s (34 cycles); 72 °C for 7 min. After the RT-PCR, 10 μl of the products was separated on a 1% agarose gel. PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-5Zf(+) vector using the pGEMT-T vector system I (Promega). Recombinant plasmids were subjected to DNA sequencing using the RRDye Deoxy Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer) with the sequencing primers Sp6 and T7. Platelet samples were boiled for 5 min at 96 °C, and proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 25 mm Tris-base, 192.5 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS. Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine (pH 8.3), and 20% methanol (v/v) using the Bio-Rad2 wet blotting system. Protein transfer was controlled by Ponceau S staining. Thereafter, the blots were destained in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 15 min. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% Protifar in TBST for 30 min at room temperature, and the blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal antibody raised against PKBα (1:4000), PKBβ (1:4000), and PKBγ (1:4000) or against phosphorylated PKBα using phospho-Akt Ser473(1:1500, in TBST/5% Protifar) under continuous shaking. After three washes with TBST, the blots were probed with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG (1:2000 in TBST/5% Protifar) for 45 min at 4 °C. After additional washing steps, the enhanced chemiluminescence system was used to detect immunoreactivity on x-ray films. For analysis of Thr308phosphorylation, the blots were stripped by a 30-min incubation in TBST supplied with 2% SDS at 80 °C. After extensive washing with aqua dest, the blots were subjected to the same procedure as described above, using polyclonal phospho-Akt Thr308antibody (1:1500) as first antibody. Since this antibody recognizes an aspecific protein band of 70 kDa, this band was taken as a control for lane loading. Quantification of the immunopositive bands was performed after scanning of the x-ray film using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The agonist-dependent activity of PKB was determined using a modification of the PKBα Immunoprecipitation Kinase Assay Kit from Upstate Biotechnology. Briefly, 250 μl of washed platelets were stimulated with α-thrombin (0.5 units/ml), TPO (50 ng/ml), or PMA (0.5 μm) for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× concentrated lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μmmicrocystin). The samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Total PKBα was immunoprecipitated from the lysate with 4 μg of the antibody, recognizing nonphosphorylated as well as phosphorylated PKBα, coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads in an end-over-end shaker overnight at 4 °C. The enzyme/antibody/protein A-Sepharose pellet was washed three times with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, twice with 500 μl of washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.03% (w/v) Brij-35, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) and twice with 100 μl of assay dilution buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmdithiothreitol). The pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of ice-cold assay dilution buffer, 10 μl of 40 μmcAMP-dependent protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (TYADFIASGRTGRRNAI-NH2), and 100 μm PKB substrate peptide (RPRAATF), included in the kit. The reaction was started by adding 1 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP per sample. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C under continuous shaking. The proteins were precipitated with 40% trichloric acid, and 40-μl aliquots were spotted onto phosphocellulose paper. The paper was washed three times in 0.75% phosphoric acid and once in acetone, and the radioactivity was determined in a scintillation mixture. For in vitro phosphorylation experiments of PKBα by catalytic subunits of PKCα/β, two different experimental approaches were employed. First, PKBα was immunoprecipitated from resting platelets as described above and was incubated with 0.02 μg of catalytic PKC fragment in 40 μl of a buffer containing Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.4) and 10 mm MgCl2. The reaction was started by the addition of 4 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mol). After 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and32P incorporation was determined by autoradiography. In the second approach, 400 μl of total lysate from resting platelets (2 × 105 platelets/μl) was prepared as described above and incubated with purified PKC catalytic subunit (0.02 μg), PMA (0.5 μm), α-thrombin (0.5 units/ml), or TPO (50 ng/ml). The phosphorylation reaction was started by the addition of ATP (100 μm) at 30 °C. At the indicated time points, samples of 55 μl were removed and added to new tubes containing concentrated sample buffer. Phosphorylation of PKB on Ser473, Thr450, and Thr308 was determined in Western blot analysis as described above. Sequences were analyzed using HUSAR 3.0 software package based on the sequence analysis software package 7.2 from the Genetic Group (Madison, WI). We first identified the PKB isoenzyme distribution by RT-PCR and compared the results with the expression levels in Western blot analysis. Degenerated oligonucleotide primers against conserved sequence regions in the pleckstrin homology and catalytic domains of rat and human PKB (α, β, γ) and PKCα-, PKCβ-, and PKCγ-specific primers were employed using cDNA from human blood platelets as template. The primer combinations resulted in amplification of products with the expected sizes for the PKBα and PKBβ genes; no product for PKBγ was detected (Fig. 1 A). The PCR products amplified with degenerated and subtype-specific primers were cloned into a pGEM-T vector and subjected to DNA sequencing. Eighty percent of the analyzed clones obtained with the degenerated oligonucleotides showed 100% amino acid sequence homology with human PKBα, and 20% of the clones showed 98% homology with human PKBβ. The PCR bands amplified with the PKBα- and PKBβ-specific primers were subjected to the same procedure and showed 100% sequence homology with PKBα and PKBβ. No PCR product was obtained with the PKBγ-specific primers, indicating that PKCγ mRNA is not detectable in platelets. Interestingly, the PCR band amplified with PKBα primers was much stronger than the band of PKBβ. Since both primers have identical potencies, as confirmed by RT-PCR of the PCR products subcloned into the pGEM-T (data not shown), these results indicate that PKBα is the predominant PKB subtype in human platelets. This conclusion was supported by Western blot analysis showing a higher expression PKBα than PKBβ, whereas PKBγ was not detected (Fig. 1 B). In order to identify the mechanisms that initiate PKB phosphorylation, we used antibodies specific for Ser(P)473, Thr(P)450, and Thr(P)308. From all agonists tested, including ADP (10 μm) and platelet-activating factor (5 nm), only α-thrombin (0.1 units/ml) and TPO (20 ng/ml) triggered a rapid and sustained PKBα-Ser473phosphorylation (Ser(P)473). Fig.2 A shows that increasing concentrations up to 0.3 units/ml α-thrombin were accompanied by a parallel rise in Ser(P)473, resulting in a 4-fold increase at 0.1–0.2 units/ml α-thrombin. Higher concentrations revealed further phosphorylation, which did not reach saturation at 1.2 units/ml α-thrombin. Since in human platelets α-thrombin signals via PAR1 and PAR4 receptors, experiments were repeated with the PAR1-activating peptide SFLLRN and the PAR4-activating peptide GYPGKF. The PAR1-activating peptide (15 μm) induced about 50% of the Ser473 phosphorylation observed with α-thrombin, whereas the PAR4-activating peptide (500 μm) failed to activate PKBα completely. The simultaneous addition of both peptides induced the same PKBα activation as α-thrombin (data not shown). A much weaker Ser473 phosphorylation was induced by TPO with a 2.5-fold increase at 50 ng/ml (Fig. 2 B). In contrast to α-thrombin, the effect by TPO was saturable, and TPO doses up to 75 ng/ml did not further increase Ser(P)473. Reprobing of the blots with anti-Thr(P)308 antibody showed that α-thrombin and TPO also raised the level of Thr(P)308 and that the dose-response curves for both agonists were similar to those of Ser(P)473 (data not shown). To determine the kinetics of PKB phosphorylation, Ser(P)473and Thr(P)308 were monitored over a time range of 1–20 min. As depicted in Fig. 3 A, α-thrombin caused a rapid increase in Ser(P)473, showing a 3-fold (after 1 min) to 5-fold (after 10 min) increase, which remained stable for another 10 min. TPO initiated a slower and about 1-fold weaker phosphorylation compared with α-thrombin. Again, the changes in Thr(P)308 were similar to those of Ser(P)473 (Fig. 3 B). In order to examine whether the third phoshorylation site, Thr450, was affected by the agonists, the blots were reprobed with a polyclonal antibody recognizing phosphorylated Thr450. As depicted in Fig.3 C, no changes in the basal phosphorylation of Thr450 were detected. These results illustrate that α-thrombin is a more potent activator of PKB phosphorylation than TPO and suggest that both agonists start different signaling pathways that lead to concurrent phosphorylation of Ser473 and Thr308. Earlier studies have shown that PI-3K is the main upstream regulator of PKB (5Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 6Burgering B.M.

Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Fig.4 A illustrates that LY294002, an inhibitor of PI-3K, inhibited the rise in Ser(P)473 induced by both agonists, but there was a notable difference between α-thrombin and TPO. LY294002 reduced the α-thrombin-induced Ser473 phosphorylation by about 60%, whereas the inhibition of TPO-induced Ser473phosphorylation was almost complete. Hence, Ser473phosphorylation induced by α-thrombin was partly independent of PI-3K, a property not seen with TPO. Interestingly, this difference was not seen at the level of Thr308, where LY294002 inhibited both the α-thrombin- and TPO-induced phosphorylation almost completely (Fig. 4 B). Thus, both α-thrombin and TPO initiate the phosphorylation of Thr308 via PI-3K. In addition, there is a second, PI-3K-independ"
https://openalex.org/W2325577633,"To clarify the role of the H-Ras in vivo, we generated H-ras null mutant mice by gene targeting. In spite of the importance of the Ras in cell proliferation and differentiation, H-ras null mutant mice grew normally and were fertile. The oldest H-ras mutant mice grew to be more than 30 months old. We used the H-ras deficient mice to study the importance of the H-ras and other ras genes in the development of skin tumors induced by initiation with 7, 12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) followed by promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We showed that H-ras null mutant mice develop approximately six times less papillomas compared with wild-type littermates after 20 weeks of TPA treatment. While all papillomas examined (17 out of 17) in wild-type mice have mutations of H-ras at codon 61, 13 (62%) out of 21 papillomas in H-ras null mutant mice have mutations of K-ras gene at codon 12, 13, or 61 and another eight (38%) papillomas have no mutations in these codons of K-ras or N-ras genes. This suggests that the activation of H-ras gene is critical in the wild-type mice, but the activation of K-ras gene can replace the H-ras activation in the initiation step of skin tumor development in the H-ras deficient mice.

https://openalex.org/W2003362851,"Identifying mechanisms that underlie the resistance of human melanoma to radiation and chemotherapy is expected to assist in developing new strategies for the treatment of this tumor type. We recently demonstrated that through up-regulation of TNFalpha, ATF2 increases the resistance of late stage melanoma cells to apoptosis induced by UV-irradiation. In elucidating the role of ATF2 kinases, we now demonstrate that ASK1/MKK6/p38 elicits suppression of Fas expression. ASK1/p38 downregulates the expression of a Fas via NF-kappaB/SP1 site on the Fas promoter. Deletion or mutation of NF-kappaB/SP1 within the Fas promoter abrogates p38 effect. ASK1/p38 silences the Fas promoter by inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation - thereby limiting NF-kappaB activity. Forced expression of a dominant negative form of p38 (p38-ASP) or treatment with p38 pharmacological inhibitor, SB203580, increases NF-kappaB activity, Fas expression and the levels of UVC-induced apoptosis in late stage melanoma cells. Inhibition of p38 activity also restored NF-kappaB activity and Fas expression in early-phase melanoma cells, suggesting that p38 elicited suppression of Fas expression is not restricted to late phase melanoma. Identifying p38-mediated down-regulation of Fas expression illustrates a novel regulatory pathway by which ASK1/MKK6/p38 alters the degree and nature of the UV-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells.

https://openalex.org/W2172011217,"Previously, we produced the whole extracellular region of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1) in a soluble form. The soluble receptor retained a ligand affinity comparable with that of the full-length membrane-bound receptor and formed a disulfide-linked dimer. Here, we have identified a cysteine residue responsible for the intermolecular disulfide bond and determined domain organization of the extracellular region of mGluR1. A mutant, C140A, was a monomer under nonreduced conditions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; however, C140A was eluted at the position similar to that of mGluR113, the wild type soluble receptor, by size exclusion column chromatography. Furthermore, C140A bound a ligand, [3H]quisqualate, with an affinity similar to that obtained by mGluR113. Oocytes injected with RNA for full-length mGluR1 containing C140A mutation showed responses to ligands at magnitudes similar to those with wild type full-length RNA. Thus, elimination of the disulfide linkage did not perturb the dimer formation and ligand signaling, suggesting that cryptic dimer interface(s) possibly exist in mGluR1. Limited proteolysis of the whole extracellular fragment (residue 33–592) revealed two trypsin-sensitive sites, after the residues Arg139 and Arg521. A 15-kDa NH2-terminal proteolytic fragment (residue 33–139) was associated with the downstream part after the digestion. Arg521 was located before a cysteine-rich stretch preceding the transmembrane region. A new shorter soluble receptor (residue 33–522) lacking the cysteine-rich region was designed based on the protease-sensitive boundary. The purified receptor protein gave aK d value of 58.1 ± 0.84 nm, which is compatible to a reported value of the full-length receptor. TheB max value was 7.06 ± 0.82 nmol/mg of protein. These results indicated that the ligand-binding specificity of mGluR1 is confined to the NH2-terminal 490-amino acid region of the mature protein.

The purified receptor protein gave aK d value of 58.1 ± 0.84 nm, which is compatible to a reported value of the full-length receptor. TheB max value was 7.06 ± 0.82 nmol/mg of protein. These results indicated that the ligand-binding specificity of mGluR1 is confined to the NH2-terminal 490-amino acid region of the mature protein. metabotropic glutamate receptor calcium sensing receptor G protein-coupled receptor leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate) N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis monoclonal antibody polyethylene glycol dithiothreitol ligand binding domain cysteine-rich domain base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) γ-aminobutyric acid B l-Glutamate is a major neurotransmitter of excitatory synapses in mammalian brains. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)1 are thought to modulate synaptic neurotransmission (1Nakanishi S. Masu M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 319-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Eight subtypes of mGluRs and the calcium sensing receptor (CaR) (2Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar) share amino acid sequence homology. mGluRs possess seven transmembrane segments and are considered to be G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). mGluRs contain a large extracellular region (∼600 amino acids) in contrast to ordinary GPCRs. The NH2-terminal extracellular regions have amino acid sequence similarity (3O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thøgersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) to that of leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein (LIVBP) (4Sack J.S. Saper M.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), one of the bacterial periplasmic binding proteins. The LIVBP-like region is followed by a cysteine-rich region that precedes the first transmembrane segment. LIVBP-like regions are also found in the GABAB receptor (5Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), the putative pheromone receptor (6Herrada G. Dulac C.

Cell. 1997; 90: 775-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich region is not shared by the bacterial binding proteins and the GABAB receptor. These receptor proteins, which contain a large extracellular region similar to that of mGluR, have been designated as family 3 GPCR (8Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Thus, structural resemblance among the family 3 receptors has been predicted. Previously, we were able to express the whole extracellular region of mGluR1 in a soluble form (9Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The receptor protein secreted into the culture medium retained the ligand binding affinity and selectivity comparable with those of the full-length membrane bound receptor. Interestingly, the soluble receptor of mGluR1 was a cysteine-linked dimer. Dimer or oligomer forms of other subtypes of mGluRs, mGluR5 (10Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and mGluR4 (11Han G. Hampson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10008-10013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), or of CaR (12Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11303-11309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have been also reported. However, the precise mechanism of ligand binding to the mGluR is unknown. It is still unclear whether glutamate binds to mGluRs in an analogous way to the venus flytrap model proposed in the bacterial binding proteins (14Quiocho F.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 341-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereby the ligand bound to one lobe is trapped to another lobe by the bending motion of the hinge region. Role(s) of dimerization of mGluR1 in ligand binding and signal transmission remain to be elucidated. The significance of dimerization in signal transduction of single-span transmembrane receptors for growth factors or cytokines has been studied extensively (15Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1998; 94: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The main focus is on whether structural details of extracellular regions have an influence on intracellular signaling (16Syed R.S. Reid S.W. Li C. Cheetham J.C. Aoki K.H. Liu B. Zhan H. Osslund T.D. Chirino A.J. Zhang J. Finer-Moore J. Elliott S. Sitney K. Katz B.A. Matthews D.J. Wendoloski J.J. Egrie J. Stroud R.M.

For GPCRs, hetero- or homodimer formation has been reported in a few cases such as some subtypes of dopamine receptors (18Ng G.Y. O'Dowd B.F. Lee S.P. Chung H.T. Brann M.R. Seeman P. George S.R.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Domain swapping among transmembrane segments has been proposed to be a causative factor in self-association of adrenergic receptors (21Gouldson P.R. Snell C.R. Bywater R.P. Higgs C. Reynolds C.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Technical difficulties have been accompanied with those studies because of seven hydrophobic transmembrane segments. However, more convincing evidence has recently emerged of dimer formation in GPCRs. A heterodimeric opioid receptor dimer with an affinity and ligand selectivity different from those of the homodimer has been reported (22Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Dimerization in the intracellular region is also reported to be essential for functional expression of the GABAB heterodimer receptor (23Jones K.A. Borowsky B. Tamm J.A. Craig D.A. Durkin M.M. Dai M.

These results suggest a possibility that dimerization of GPCR is not a rare phenomenon but rather a common occurrence. In this study, with the advantage of purified dimerized material, we have determined a cysteine residue responsible for the intermolecular disulfide bonding by amino acid point mutation. Effects of disruption of the disulfide bond on ligand binding and signaling were examined. The existence of a cryptic dimer interface in mGluR is discussed. In order to delineate ligand binding core of mGluR1, we furthermore defined the domain organization of the extracellular region by proteolysis experiments. The new recombinant virus, designed according to the protease-sensitive boundary, produced the shorter soluble receptor lacking the cysteine-rich region. We have determined a ligand-binding constant and a maximal binding value of this soluble receptor that consists solely of the LIVBP-like domain in comparison with that of the soluble receptor encompassing the whole extracellular domain. l-Quisqualic acid was purchased from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Langford Bristol, United Kingdom).l-Glutamic acid monosodium salt was purchased from Nakalai tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Linear gradient polyacrylamide gels were Multigel, obtained from Daiichi Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). Ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS) was obtained from Pierce. N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPS) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Type XI trypsin, diphenyl carbamyl chloride-treated, from bovine pancreas, was obtained from Sigma Aldrich. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were propagated in a monolayer at 27 °C in TNM-FH (Grace's powder medium, 0.3% yeastolate, 0.3% lactalbumin hydrolyzate, 0.1% pluronic F-68; Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) or in suspension at 27 °C in IPL-41 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.3% tryptose phosphate (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.1% pluronic F-68. 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B were used. Trichoplusia niBTI-TN-5B1–4 (High Five) cells were cultured in a monolayer at 27 °C in Express FiveTM serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 18 mml-glutamine. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated by co-transfecting Sf9 insect cells with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 0.1 μg of BaculoGold baculovirus DNA (PharMingen) with Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 6 days of incubation, the supernatant was harvested. The virus in the supernatant was titrated, and individual plaques were isolated. Virus stocks were prepared in monolayer or suspension cultures of Sf9 cells. Baculovirus infection was performed as described previously (9Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, after being infected with baculoviruses for soluble receptors, High Five cells were incubated for 4 or 5 days. Both transfer vectors, pVLmGluR113 and pVLmGluR114, were constructed from pmGluR108 (9Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). pVLmGluR113 was made as follows. A set of complementary oligonucleotides, HJ110 (5′-CACAGGCTGTGAGCCCATTCCTGTCCGTTATCTTGAGTGGAGTGACATAGAATAGTGAT-3′) and HJ111 (5′-CTAGATCACTATTCTATGTCACTCCACTCAAGATAACGGACAGGAATGGGCTCACAGCCTGTGAGCT-3′), were annealed and cloned into theSacI/XbaI-digested fragment of pmGluR108. pVLmGluR114 was made as follows. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done with primers TO1 (5′-CATCAATGCCATCTATGCCATGGC-3′) and HJ112 (5′-TCTAGATTACTAAGATCGTACCATTCCGCTTTTGTTC-3′) using pmGluR108 as a template. TO1 contains an NcoI site. HJ112 contains anXbaI site. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and XbaI and was cloned into theNcoI/XbaI-digested fragment of pmGluR108. Transfer verctors for mutant receptors were made as follows. Mutants in the wild type background are denoted with the number of the residue and amino acid substituted. A BglII-XbaI fragment was cut out of pVLmGluR114 and ligated intoBamHI/XbaI-digested pKF19k (Takara). With this plasmid as a template, PCR was performed with selection primer and each of primers C67A (5′-GATCTCCCCAGCCTTCCTTTCG-3′), C109A (5′-AGAGTGCCAGGCGGAGTCCCGG-3′) and C140A (5′-ATCAGGCAGGGCTCGGTTCAGC-3′). Following the protocol of Mutan-Super Express Km kit (Takara), the plasmids pKFC67A, pKFC109A, and pKF140A, which contain the mutated sequences, were obtained. 391-bpNotI-EcoRI fragments of pKFC67A and pKFC109A and a 390-bp EcoRI-AatI fragment were ligated into the NotI/EcoRI-digested pVLmGluR113 andEcoRI/AatI-digested pVLmGluR113, yielding pVLmGluR113C67A, pVLmGluR113C109A, and pVLmGluR113C140A. All the PCR products were fully sequenced. These transfer vectors were used for transfection to insect cells with BaculoGold baculovirus DNA. Essentially the same as described previously (9Okamoto T.

Culture medium was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). mGluRs were identified by using the monoclonal antibody (mAb) mG1Na-1 (9Okamoto T.

Color development was done by a commercial detection kit (Promega). Samples were analyzed by 2–15% or 4–20% linear gradient polyacrylamide gels not containing SDS in the gel matrix. SDS was not included in either the running buffer or the sample buffer. Gels were silver-stained. Molecular weight standards were from Daiichi Pure Chemicals. A conditioned medium of receptor-producing High Five cells was concentrated to 10–50 fold in the presence of protease inhibitor mixtures (1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and washed by 40 mm2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethanesulfonic acid (Hepes) (pH 7.5) containing 10% glycerol, 1 m NaCl, and the protease inhibitor mixtures. Concentrated material was centrifuged at 15, 000 rpm for 20 min, filtrated by a 0.22-μm filter, and loaded on an immunoaffinity column, which was conjugated with mAb mG1Na-1 as described previously (9Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The column was washed by 30 ml of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm NaCl, and the bound material was eluted with 100 mm CAPS, pH 11, containing 200 mm NaCl. Eluate was neutralized with 2m Hepes, pH 7.5. Aliquots of the eluate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Positively stained fractions were pooled and analyzed by ligand binding assay. The pooled fraction was then further purified by ion exchange column chromatography. After being diluted five times with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, the sample was applied on Resource Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) fitted toÄKTA Explorer 10S (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and eluted by NaCl at a gradient from 0 to 1.2 m. In order to compare the gel filtration pattern of mGluR113 with that of its cysteine mutant, aliquots of the immunoaffinity column eluate were loaded on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200pg (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mmHepes, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm NaCl and 10% glycerol, by high performance liquid chromatography (Waters 626LC). The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and fractions of 5 ml each were collected. Ligand binding was performed with the polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method as described previously (28Miyazaki J. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 687-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 or 40 nm [3H]quisqualate (323 GBq/mmol) (a gift from Banyu Tsukuba Research Institute) and soluble receptor samples were mixed in 150 μl of a binding buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 2.5 mmCaCl2) at 4 °C for 1 h. After the binding reaction, 6-kDa PEG was added to the sample at the concentration of 15% with 3 mg/ml of γ globulin. Precipitated material was washed twice with 1 ml of 8% 6-kDa PEG and dissolved in 1 ml of water. After addition of 14 ml of Scintisol EX-H (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), the radioactivity was counted in the scintillation counter. Binding data was analyzed by the software of Prism II (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA). Saturation binding curves were fitted to a one-site binding model, andK d and B max values were calculated. A 777-bp SacII-AatI fragment of pKFC140A, a 3.2-kbpAatI-SacII fragment of pmGR1 (29Masu M. Tanabe Y. Tsuchida K. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 349: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), and a 3.7-kbpSacII-SacII fragment of pmGR1 were ligated. The resulting plasmid, pmGR1C140A, and pmGR1 were used as templates forin vitro transcription to yield complementary RNA (cRNAs). The plasmid DNA was linearized by NotI, and capped cRNA was synthesized with MEGAscript T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared according to the standard procedure. The follicular cell layer was removed by treatment with Ca2+-free ND solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) containing 100 μg/100 ml of collagenase-B (Yakuruto, Tokyo, Japan) for 1.5 h at 18 °C. The oocytes were then injected with 10 ng of cRNAs. The injected oocytes were incubated in ND solution for 1–2 days. A two-electrode voltage clamp system was used to measure glutamate- and quisqualate-induced chloride ion currents. The membrane potential was held at −60 mV in all measurements. All currents were filtered at 1 kHz, and data were stored and analyzed using MacLab system (Bio-Research-Center, Nagoya, Japan). All measurements were conducted at room temperature. The cross-linker, EGS, was dissolved at 20 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted into the protein solution to give the final concentration of 1 mm. The reaction proceeding at 25 °C for 30 min was stopped by the addition of Tris-HCl buffer from a 1 m stock solution at pH 7.5, and a further incubation was conducted at 25 °C for 15 min. The cross-linked material was analyzed by 4–20% SDS-PAGE and silver-stained (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Purified protein was digested in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, with different concentrations of trypsin. Reaction was stopped with 0.01 mm PMSF and sample buffer. Aliquot was not heated and was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Trans-Blot transfer medium, Bio-Rad), stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (PAGE Blue83, Daiichi Pure Chemicals), and destained with 20% methanol. The protein bands were excised and subjected to automated Edman degradation by an Applied Biosystems Procise model 492 protein sequencer. The purified mGluRs in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, was equilibrated with glycerol (up to 50% (v/v)). Final concentration of the protein was 50 μg/ml each. 50 μl of the sample was sprayed onto mica surface cleaved freshly by using a painter's airbrush (Olympus model SP-B, f 0.18 mm). Then, the sample on the mica was rapidly brought into a freeze-etching device equipped with a large turbo pump (FR 7000, Hitachi, Mito, Japan), dried for 10 min (room temperature) in vacuum (1 × 10−6 pascals), and then cooled down to −100 °C. Subsequently, specimens were rotary shadowed with platinum by an electron gun positioned at an angle of 2.5° to the mica surface and followed by carbon evaporation. Shadowed films were removed from the mica by slowly soaking the mica into water, mounted on copper grids and examined under a Jeol 100CX electron microscope (Jeol Co., Ltd., Tokyo). Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of the transfer vectors, pVLmGluR113, pVLmGluR113C67A, pVLmGluR113C109A, pVLmGluR113C140A, and pVLmGluR114, used for making the recombinant viruses for mGluR113, mGluR113C67A, mGluR113C109A, mGluR113C140A, and mGluR114. pVLmGluR113 encodes complementary DNA (cDNA) corresponding to the region Met1–Glu592 of the primary amino acid sequence of mGluR1. pVLmGluR114 encodes cDNA corresponding to the region Met1–Ser522. pmGluR108 that was used in our previous study (9Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) encoded the amino acid region identical with that of pVLmGluR113 and six histidine codons at its COOH terminus. In this study, a His tag sequence of pmGluR108 was omitted in pVLmGluR113. Recombinant viruses for the receptors were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” mGluR113 encodes the whole extracellular region of mGluR1. Amino acid mutation was introduced at the first three consecutive cysteine residues (Cys67, Cys109, and Cys140). The mutant receptor proteins were designated C67A, C109A, and C140A. Concentrated culture medium of insect cells infected with the recombinant viruses for cysteine mutants as well as for mGluR113 was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 A). In the presence of 20 mm DTT (left panel), the three mutants were detected as approximate 65-kDa bands. Under nonreduced conditions (right panel), C67A and C109A was electrophoresed at around 130-kDa bands; however, C140A was electrophoresed much faster with a position corresponding to the monomer band. The sizes of C67A and C109A appeared significantly different from that of mGluR113, suggesting a conformational change. These results clearly showed that alanine mutation at Cys140 eliminated the intermolecular disulfide bonding. Next we compared ligand binding capacities between C140A and mGluR113. As concentrated culture medium of insect cells infected with the viruses for C140A showed ligand binding capacity comparable to that of mGluR113 (data not shown), we next purified C140A by an immunoaffinity column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Although the purified C140A sample showed a band equal to that of mGluR113 under reduced conditions (Fig. 2 B, left panel), C140A migrated much faster than mGluR113 under nonreduced conditions (center panel). Surprisingly, this mutated receptor migrated as a dimer on native-polyacrylamide gels as did mGluR113 (right panel). We also observed a small amount of larger oligomers of C140A. These data indicated that mutation at Cys140eliminated disulfide bonding in the extracellular portion of mGluR1, but the extracellular portion of the C140A receptor folded in a manner that maintained noncovalent dimerization of the receptor molecule. To reinforce this result, C140A was subjected to gel filtration column chromatography in parallel with mGluR113 (Fig.3). Calibration with molecular size markers showed the eluting position of mGluR113 to be around 185 kDa and that of C140A to be around 150 kDa. Both receptors were definitely larger than a monomer and seemed to be a dimer or a larger oligomer. The ligand binding ability of C140A was quantitatively examined by comparing the inhibition of [3H]quisqualate binding to the purified C140A and mGluR113 with unlabeled glutamate and quisqualate (Fig. 4 A). Both receptors did not make a great difference in dose-response curves of unlabeled glutamate and quisqualate. These data indicated that there was no great difference between mGluR113 and C140A in affinities to glutamate and quisqualate. We next examined the importance of the disulfide linkage in signal transmission of mGluR1 using the oocyte expression system (Fig. 4 B). A messenger RNA (mRNA), which encodes a full-length of mGluR1 whose Cys140 was mutated to alanine, was created. Oocytes injected with the mutated mGluR1mRNA as well as the wild type mGluR1mRNA were stimulated with ligands, glutamate and quisqualate. The magnitude of the chloride currents induced by both ligands of oocytes injected with mutant RNA increased dose-dependently. At each ligand concentration, the current response of mutant mGluR1 was comparable with that of wild type mGluR1. This result indicated that C140A mutation in a full-length receptor did not alter the affinity to the ligands or the ability to couple to intracellular signaling cascades. Next, in order to understand the domain organization of the mGluR1 extracellular region, we determined the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of soluble receptor protein, mGluR113, that was generated by removal of a signal peptide and found that mGluR113 began with residue Ser33. Proteinase digestion was then performed using the purified mGluR113 (Fig. 5,A and B). Limited proteolysis of mGluR113 by trypsin gave rise to at least five major bands. Each of these bands (designated as fragments 1–5) were excised from a polyvinylidene difluoride blot and sequenced at the NH2-terminal end by Edman degradation. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the 15-kDa band (fragment 4) was identical with that of mGluR113. NH2-terminal sequencing of the 50-kDa band (fragment 2) revealed that the digestion site was Arg139 before (C)140LPDG.

The NH2-terminal sequence of an 8-kDa band (fragment 5), which was faintly observed by limited digestion without DTT but was clearly visible in the lanes of samples digested in the presence of 1 mm DTT, disclosed the other trypsin-sensitive site, Arg521 before S522V(C)SE.

We have analysed the activity of the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK cascade in the human pancreatic carcinoma cell line PANC-1 carrying an activating K-ras mutation. Serum-starved cells and cells grown in medium with serum did not show constitutively activated c-Raf, MEK-1, or p42 MAPK. Stimulation of cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or fetal calf serum (FCS) resulted in activation of N-Ras, but not K-Ras, as well as activation of c-Raf, MEK-1, and p42 MAPK. Preincubation of serum-starved cells with MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 abolished EGF- and FCS-induced MAPK activation, identifying MEK as the upstream activator of MAPK. PANC-1 cells exhibited marked serum-dependence of anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth as well as cell migration. EGF, alone or in combination with insulin and transferrin, did not induce cell proliferation of serum-starved PANC-1 cells, indicating that activation of MAPK alone was not sufficient to induce cell proliferation. FCS-induced DNA synthesis was inhibited by 40% by the MEK-1 inhibitor. On the other hand, treatment with either FCS or EGF alone resulted in marked, MEK-dependent increase of directed cell migration. Collectively, our results show that the activating K-ras mutation in PANC-1 cells does not result in constitutively increased Raf-MEK-MAPK signaling. Signal transduction via the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK cascade is maintained in these cells and is required for growth factor-induced cell proliferation and directed cell migration. Oncogene (2000)."

https://openalex.org/W1999592964,"PKR is a double-stranded (ds) RNA activated protein kinase whose expression is induced by interferon. Activated PKR phosphorylates its cellular substrate, eIF2, an essential initiation factor of translation. Prior evidence from a murine model system suggested that PKR may act as a tumor suppressor, but the evidence from human tumors is equivocal. To study PKR function in human breast cancer, PKR activity was measured in mammary carcinoma cell lines and nontransformed mammary epithelial cell lines. If PKR functioned as a tumor suppressor in this system, its activity would be higher in nontransformed cells than in carcinoma cells. On the contrary, PKR autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of its substrate, the alpha-subunit of eIF2, is 7 - 40-fold higher in lysates prepared from breast carcinoma cell lines than in those from nontransformed epithelial cell lines. Correspondingly, a larger proportion of eIF2alpha is present in a phosphorylated state in carcinoma cell lines than in nontransformed cell lines. Protein synthesis is not inhibited by the high eIF2alpha phosphorylation in carcinoma cells, probably because they contain higher levels of eIF2B, the initiation factor that is inhibited by eIF2alpha phosphorylation. The dramatically lower PKR activity in nontransformed cell lines is partially due to lower PKR protein levels (2 - 4-fold) as well as to the presence of a PKR inhibitor. The nontransformed cells contain P58, a known cellular inhibitor of PKR that physically interacts with PKR and may be responsible for the low PKR activity in these cells. Taken together, these observations call into question the role of PKR as a tumor suppressor and suggest a positive regulatory role of PKR in growth control of breast cancer cells."

As it disseminates hematogenously and invades a wide range of tissues, T. pallidum presumably must tolerate substantial oxidative stress. Analysis of the T. pallidumgenome indicates that the syphilis spirochete lacks most of the iron-binding proteins present in many other bacterial pathogens, including the oxidative defense enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase, but does possess an orthologue (TP0823) for neelaredoxin, an enzyme of hyperthermophilic and sulfate-reducing anaerobes shown to possess superoxide reductase activity. To analyze the potential role of neelaredoxin in treponemal oxidative defense, we examined the biochemical, spectroscopic, and antioxidant properties of recombinant T. pallidum neelaredoxin. Neelaredoxin was shown to be expressed in T. pallidum by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Recombinant neelaredoxin is a 26-kDa α2 homodimer containing, on average, 0.7 iron atoms/subunit. Mössbauer and EPR analysis of the purified protein indicates that the iron atom exists as a mononuclear center in a mixture of high spin ferrous and ferric oxidation states. The fully oxidized form, obtained by the addition of K3(Fe(CN)6), exhibits an optical spectrum with absorbances at 280, 320, and 656 nm; the last feature is responsible for the protein's blue color, which disappears upon ascorbate reduction. The fully oxidized protein has aA 280/A 656 ratio of 10.3.

Despite the availability of effective antimicrobial therapy since the late 1940s, syphilis remains a significant threat to global health by virtue of the morbidity and mortality it inflicts as well as its ability to facilitate the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (1Nakashima A.K. Rolfs R.T. Flock M.L. Kilmarx P. Greenspan J.R. Sex. Transm. Dis. 1996; 23: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 2Perine P.L. Med. J.

The disease begins as an ulcer (chancre) at the site of inoculation ofT. pallidum, usually in the genital area, and, when untreated, may progress through secondary (disseminated), late, and tertiary (recrudescent) stages (4Tramont E.C. Mandell G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. Churchill Livingstone, Inc., New York1994: 2117-2133Google Scholar). The protean nature of syphilitic infection underscores T. pallidum's remarkable ability to thrive in diverse nutritional milieus within the human host while, at the same time, evading the robust cellular and humoral immune responses it provokes. Paradoxically, T. pallidum has long been known to lack numerous biosynthetic and catabolic capabilities (5Cox C.D. Schell R.F. Musher D.M. Pathogenesis and Immunology of Treponemal Infection. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1983: 57-70Google Scholar), and the sequence of its 1.138 megabase chromosome has further underscored the bacterium's metabolic limitations (6Fraser C.M. Norris S.J. Weinstock G.M. White O. Sutton G.G. Dodson R. Gwinn M. Hickey E.K. Clayton R. Ketchum K.A. Sodergren E. Hardham J.M. McLeod M.P. Salzberg S. Peterson J. Khalak H. Richardson D. Howell J.K.

Science. 1998; 281: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). T. pallidum is currently classified as a microaerophile because of its limited tolerance for the toxic effects of oxygen duringin vitro cultivation (7Cover W.H. Norris S.J. Miller J.N. Sex. Transm. Dis. 1982; 9: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 8Cox D.L. Riley B. Chang P. Sayahtaheri S. Tassell S. Hevelone J. Appl. Environ.

This presents something of a paradox, however, given that the bacterium readily disseminates hematogenously and thrives in well oxygenated tissues. An examination of the mechanism(s) by which T. pallidum copes with oxidative stress would appear to be a logical starting point for resolution of the apparent contradiction between the syphilis spirochete's susceptibility to oxygen toxicity and its frequent exposure to environments with high redox potential. It has recently been hypothesized that T. pallidum has a limited requirement for iron (9Posey J.E. Hardham J.M. Norris S.J. Gherardini F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nevertheless, it does possess an orthologue (TP0823) for neelaredoxin, a superoxide reductase of hyperthermophilic and sulfate-reducing anaerobes. Neelaredoxin was first purified fromDesulfovibrio gigas and shown to bind an iron atom in a unique coordination environment (12Chen L. Sharma P. Le Gall J. Mariano A.M. Teixeira M. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Neelaredoxin is homologous to the C-terminal domain of desulfoferrodoxin, a superoxide reductase that binds two distinct iron atoms (centers I and II) (12Chen L. Sharma P. Le Gall J. Mariano A.M. Teixeira M. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Moura I. Tavares P. Moura J.J.G. Ravi N. Huynh B.H. Liu M.-Y. Le Gall J. J. Biol.

The N-terminal domain of desulfoferrodoxin binds an iron atom in a distorted tetrahedral environment coordinated by four cysteinyl sulfur atoms (center I), while the C-terminal domain accommodates an iron atom in a unique (N)4S coordination environment of four histidines and one cysteine residue (center II) (13Moura I.

Center II of desulfoferrodoxin has a relatively high redox potential of +240 mV, exhibits a blue color in the oxidized state (λmax = 656 nm), and becomes colorless upon reduction (13Moura I.

The recent x-ray structure of neelaredoxin from Pyrococcus furiosus reveals the same (N)4S coordination (17Yeh A.P. Hu Y. Jenney Jr., F.E. Adams M.W.W. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and indeed neelaredoxin from D. gigas has spectroscopic features comparable with center II of desulfoferrodoxin (12Chen L. Sharma P. Le Gall J. Mariano A.M. Teixeira M. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Silva G. Oliveira S. Gomes C.M. Pacheco I. Liu M.Y. Xavier A.V. Teixeira M. LeGall J. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The four histidine and cysteine residues that coordinate the iron atom of center II is uniformly conserved in all known enzymes of this family, including theT. pallidum homologue (Fig.1). Here we demonstrate that the treponemal neelaredoxin orthologue is an iron-binding protein with superoxide reductase activity. This finding, the first description of an iron-binding protein in T. pallidum, indicates that the syphilis spirochete copes with oxidative stress via a primitive mechanism, which, thus far, has not been identified in pathogenic bacteria. Spectrophotometric grade guanidine·HCl was purchased from Pierce. Powdered LB1medium was obtained from Fisher. Isopropyl-β-thio-d-galactoside was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Ampicillin, duroquinone, horse heart cytochromec, 2-hydroxy-1,4-napthoquinone, phenazine methosulfate, potassium ferricyanide, potassium superoxide, xanthine, and xanthine oxidase were purchased from Sigma. Phenazine, 5-hydroxy-1,4-napthoquinone, 1,2-napthoquinone, 1,4-napthoquinone, and sodium ascorbate were purchased from Aldrich. Sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4) was purchased from VWR. Iron, zinc, magnesium, copper, and calcium concentrations were determined by the Mayo Metals Laboratory using inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (19Fassel V.A. Science. 1978; 202: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 20Nixon D.E. Moyer T.P. Johnson P. McCall J.T. Ness A.B. Fjerstad W.H. Wehde M.B. Clin. Chem. 1986; 32: 1660-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations for metal stoichiometry determinations were determined by amino acid analysis. It was found that protein concentration determined by use of the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard yielded a concentration within ∼±15% of the concentration determined by amino acid analysis. The molar extinction coefficient of the protein at 280 nm was determined by dividing the absorbance at 280 nm of the oxidized protein by the protein concentration determined by amino acid analysis. The value obtained, 17,000 ± 6000, is about 25% higher than the value calculated for the apoprotein (13,940m−1·cm−1) based on the presence of two tryptophan and two tyrosine residues in the primary sequence according to the method of Gill and von Hippel (21Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar), indicating contributions to the UV spectrum from the metal center. ESI-MS measurements of T. pallidum neelaredoxin were done on a Finnigan (Bremen, Germany) MAT 900 mass spectrometer of EB geometry. ESI measurement of neelaredoxin was done in the positive mode. The ESI source used was a modified Finnigan MAT source modified for optimal operation at microflow delivery rates as described previously (22Johnson K.J. Veenstra T.D. Tomlinson A.J. Kumar R. Naylor S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 11: 939-942Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Sulfur hexafluoride was used to prevent formation of ESI source corona discharge. Prepared protein solutions were introduced into the source at a flow rate of 0.3 μl/min through an emitter of 20-μm inner diameter fused silica. The electrospray source voltage used was set at −2.8 (−3.6) kV and the heated capillary temperature at 180 °C. The instrument was scanned from mass to charge (m/z) 1000 to 5000 at a rate of 10 s/decade using an instrument resolution of 1000. A position- and time-resolved ion counter array detector was used for ion detection. Multiple scans were collected and summed, and the multiply charged spectra were transformed into the molecular mass (M r) scale using instrument software. Protein solutions were buffer-exchanged into 20 mm ammonium acetate and then diluted 1:1 with a solution of H2O/CH3CN/isopropyl alcohol/trifluoroacetic acid (50:40:10:0.1, v/v/v/v) to enhance denaturation of the dimer to obtain an accurate monomeric molecular mass. In order to analyze the native multimeric composition of the protein, the protein solution was sprayed in H2O/methanol/acetic acid (50:50:1, v/v/v). T. pallidum (Nichols) was propagated by intratesticular inoculation of adult New Zealand White rabbits as described previously (23Radolf J.D. Chamberlain N.R. Clausell A. Norgard M.V. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 490-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spirochetes were separated from testicular tissue by low speed centrifugation (350 ×g for 10 min). Genomic DNA was isolated using the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) DNA extraction kit. RNA was isolated from freshly harvested T. pallidum using the Ultraspec RNA isolation reagent (Biotecx, Houston, TX) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Isolated RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI), phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water along with RNase inhibitor (Promega). RT-PCR analysis was carried out using the Titan One-Tube RT-PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and primers specific for neelaredoxin (5′-AGGCAGTAGTGTCGCGTGCGG-3′ and 5′-AAAGGTCACCTCAGGCGCTCC-3′) and flaA(5′-TGAATTATCCTCATGGTTTGTACGTG-3′ and 5′-TCAGCACCGCCTTATCATAGATAATC -3′). For each primer set, four reactions were performed: (i) RT-PCR with 50 ng of RNA template, (ii) PCR with 50 ng of RNA template, (iii) RT-PCR with water only, and (iv) PCR with 3 ng of DNA. In reactions without reverse transcription, the RT-DNA polymerase mixture was replaced by the Expand High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following the RT reaction (45 °C for 30 min), PCR was performed in a Perkin-Elmer 9700 thermocycler (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the following parameters: 98 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 68 °C for 30 s followed by a single terminal extension for 2 min at 68 °C. One-fifth (5 μl) of each reaction was electrophoresed through a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide prior to photography. Two 4-week-old male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were primed intraperitoneally with 20 μg of purified recombinant protein emulsified in a 1:1 mixture with complete Freund's adjuvant and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). Booster immunizations consisting of 20 μg of protein in a 1:1 mixture with incomplete Freund's adjuvant and PBS were administered by the same route on weeks 4 and 6. Samples consisting of whole T. pallidum (5 × 107) or purified recombinant neelaredoxin were diluted 1:2 in Tricine sample buffer consisting of 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 40% glycerol (v/v), 2% SDS (v/v), 2% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v), and 0.04% Coomassie G-250 (w/v) and boiled for 5 min prior to electrophoresis through 16.5% polyacrylamide Tris-Tricine gels (Bio-Rad). Resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell) and blocked in PBS containing 5% skim milk, 5% fetal calf serum, and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h prior to immunoblotting. Immunoblots were incubated with 1:1000 dilutions of antisera in blocking buffer for 1 h, after which the membranes were extensively washed with PBS and then incubated with a 1:75,000 dilution of goat anti-rat Ig(H + L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) in blocking buffer for 1 h. Immunoblots were developed using the SuperSignal Femto chemiluminescence substrate (Peirce) followed by exposure to chemiluminescence film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The gene encoding neelaredoxin was amplified by PCR using T. pallidumgenomic DNA isolated as described above and a pair of oligonucleotides, 5′-CCATGGCATATGGGACGGGAGTTGTCG-3′ and 5′-TTAAGCTTGGATCCCTACTTACCTGACCACAC-3′, homologous to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene (6Fraser C.M.

Following PCR amplification, the PCR product was purified by electrophoresis in an 8% polyacrylamide gel in 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, 2.5 mm EDTA buffer. The 410-base pair fragment was excised from the gel, and the DNA fragment was electroeluted using an IBI model UEA Unidirectional Electroeluter according to the manufacturer's instructions. After ethanol precipitation, the purified fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and subsequently ligated into the plasmid pT7–7 (24Tabor S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley Interscience, New York1990: 16.2.1-16.2.11Google Scholar) digested with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting ligation mix was transformed into theEscherichia coli strain DH5-α and plated on LB agar containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. From the plate, individual colonies were transferred to 5 ml of LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight, after which plasmid DNA was isolated using the Promega Wizard® Plus Miniprep DNA Purification System. Positive clones were identified by restriction digest analysis of plasmid DNA with NdeI and BamHI and subsequently confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire gene. The plasmid pTpNeelT77–8/19 was subsequently used for protein overexpression in E. coli. Competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) were transformed with pTpNeelT77–8/19 and plated onto LB/agar plates containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin, after which a colony was used to inoculate 10 ml of LB/amp (0.1 mg/ml) medium. This culture was grown at 37 °C overnight, and the next morning it was used to inoculate 1.5 liters of LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin in a 6-liter Erlenmeyer flask. This culture was grown at 37 °C with shaking until the absorbance of the culture at 595 nm reached 0.8. At this point, isopropyl-β-thio-d-galactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After an additional 6 h, the cells were isolated by centrifugation for 30 min at 2500 ×g at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and lysed by three passages through a French pressure cell operating at 15,000 p.s.i. at the orifice. The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged for 60 min at 39,100 ×g, and the supernatant representing the crude cell extract was applied to a column (2.6 × 17.5 cm) containing DEAE-Sepharose CL6B anion exchange resin equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. After loading the crude extract, the column was washed with the same buffer to remove contaminating protein. At this point, the presence of the recombinant protein became evident by the appearance of a blue band adsorbed at the top of the column. The protein was eluted from the column by use of a 0–1.0 m NaCl linear gradient in the same buffer, with the majority of protein eluting as a blue fraction at a NaCl concentration of ∼0.1 m. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the best fractions in terms of purity were pooled, concentrated to ≤10 ml, and applied to a column containing Sephadex G75 gel filtration resin equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 7.8. The protein was eluted from this column with the same buffer and appeared homogeneously pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. For preparation of 57Fe-enriched protein, the cells were grown in M9 medium containing 0.4% glucose, 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin, 5 μm57FeCl3, and a 20-μl aliquot per liter of trace metals solution. The trace metals solution was prepared by dissolving 184 mg of CaCl2·2H2O, 64 mg of H3BO3, 40 mg of MnCl2·4H2O, 18 mg of CoCl2·6H2O, 4 mg of CuCl2, 340 mg of ZnCl2, and 605 mg of Na2MoO4·2H2O, in 8 ml of concentrated HCl, after which the volume was brought up to 100 ml with distilled water. A 10-ml volume of defined medium was inoculated with a colony grown on LB/ampicillin plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The next morning it was used to inoculate a 6-liter Erlenmeyer flask containing the same defined medium. Expression and purification of the protein proceeded as described above. The molecular mass of recombinant T. pallidum neelaredoxin was determined by size exclusion chromatography using a 300 × 7.8-mm Bio-Sil SEC-125 HPLC Gel Filtration Column from Bio-Rad. The mobile phase was 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl. The column was calibrated using gel filtration chromatography standards from Bio-Rad, consisting of thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa). The void volume was defined as the volume at which thyroglobulin eluted. A sample of the oxidized protein for obtaining the UV-visible spectrum was obtained by treating a sample of the purified protein with a slight excess of 15 mmK3(Fe(CN)6) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, incubating for 10 min at room temperature, followed by removal of the excess K3(Fe(CN)6) by passage of the sample over a NAP-25 column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, buffer. A slight excess of K3(Fe(CN)6) is defined as the amount of K3(Fe(CN)6) added that no longer produces any further increase in the absorbance at 656 nm. Blue-colored fractions containing the protein were pooled, and the optical spectrum was recorded immediately using a Cary 1 UV-visible spectrophotometer and 1-cm cuvettes. In order to estimate the ε656 of the oxidized protein, a sample of neelaredoxin was analyzed for the iron content by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry as described above, after which it was titrated with a slight excess of K3(Fe(CN)6). The optical spectrum was recorded immediately, and ε656 was determined by dividing theA 656 by the iron concentration. Optical spectra of the reduced protein were obtain by treating a sample of the protein with a freshly prepared solution of 15 mmsodium ascorbate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The ability of recombinant T. pallidum neelaredoxin to catalyze the dismutation of superoxide was followed by monitoring the inhibition of cytochrome creduction by superoxide generated by xanthine/xanthine oxidase as described (25Crapo J.D. McCord J.M. Fridovich I. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 382-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The SOD assay was performed at 25 °C in 1 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 100 μmEDTA, 10 μm horse heart cytochrome c, 7.5 mm xanthine, varying amounts of neelaredoxin, and an amount of xanthine oxidase that gives an initial rate of ΔA 550 of 0.025 absorbance units/min. One unit of SOD activity is defined as the amount of protein that inhibits the rate of cytochrome c reduction by 50%. The reaction of neelaredoxin with superoxide was followed using two different methods. In the first experiment, the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system was used to generate superoxide in situ. A solution of neelaredoxin (∼100 μm) was completely reduced by the addition of 1 eq of ascorbic acid from a 15 mm stock solution in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, followed by buffer exchange to remove the excess ascorbate by passage over a NAP 25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. An initial optical spectrum was obtained to verify the reduced state of the protein and to estimate the protein concentration using ε280, which indicated a protein concentration of 70 μm. Xanthine was added to a final concentration of 7.5 mm, the reaction to generate superoxide was initiated by the addition of 0.0028 units of xanthine oxidase, and optical spectra were subsequently recorded at various times. In the second experiment, optical spectra of 67 μmascorbate-reduced neelaredoxin (obtained as described above) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, were obtained following successive additions of superoxide from a KO2 stock solution, prepared by dissolving KO2 to ∼1.2 mm in Me2SO that had been dried over 3-Å molecular sieves. The exact concentration of superoxide was determined using ε260 = 2086 m−1cm−1. An optical spectrum was obtained 2–3 min after each addition of KO2. The second order rate constant for the reaction of reduced neelaredoxin with superoxide was determined in the presence of various concentrations of SOD as described by Lombard et al. (14Lombard M. Fontecave M. Touati D. Nivière V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 115-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Superoxide was generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system, and neelaredoxin oxidation was followed at 25 °C spectrophotometrically at 656 nm. A solution of neelaredoxin (∼100 μm) was completely reduced by the addition of 1 eq of ascorbic acid from a 15 mm stock solution in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, followed by buffer exchange over a NAP 25 column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. An initial optical spectrum was obtained to verify the reduced state of the protein and to estimate the protein concentration using ε280, which indicated a protein concentration of 50 μm. Oxidation was initiated upon the addition of 7.5 mm xanthine and 0.028 units of xanthine oxidase. CuZn-SOD concentrations were varied from 0 to 8 μm. Redox titrations ofT. pallidum neelaredoxin were carried out by diluting a solution of the protein to 270 μm into 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 5 μm of the following mediators: 1,2-napthoquinone, phenazine, 1,4-napthoquinone, 5-hydroxy-1,4-napthoquinone, duroquinone, phenazine methosulfate, and 2-hydroxy-1,4-napthoquinone. The solution was transferred to a 3-ml optical grade glass cuvette fitted with a rubber septum. The potential was measured between a working gold electrode and a reference Ag/AgCl electrode (Microelectrodes Inc., Londonderry, NH), which were inserted through the septum. The contents were made anaerobic by continuous purging with oxygen-free argon. The protein was first reduced by the addition of 200 μl of an anaerobic solution of 15 mmsodium dithionite. After the potential had stabilized, the solution was titrated with aliquots of K3(Fe(CN)6) to give potential changes on the order of 10–15 mV/aliquot. After each addition, the potential was measured using a voltmeter, and the optical spectrum was recorded. The data were fit to the Nernst equation using a least squares approach. Reduction potentials reported with reference to the normal hydrogen electrode were obtained by adding 199 mV to the measured potential (26Sawyer D.T. Roberts Jr., J.L. Experimental Electrochemistry for Chemists. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1974: 41-44Google Scholar). Samples of purified 57Fe-labeled neelaredoxin were concentrated to approximately 1 mm using a Centricon 3 microconcentrator and transferred to delrin Mössbauer cuvettes or quartz EPR cuvettes. Mössbauer spectra were recorded in a weak field spectrometer equipped with a Janis 8DT variable temperature cryostat operating in a constant acceleration mode in a transmission geometry.

https://openalex.org/W2323832274,"The ubiquitin/proteasome pathway has been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes and the number of substrates degraded by the proteasome is impressive. Most prominently, the stability of a large number of transcription factors is regulated by ubiquitination. To elucidate pathways regulated by the proteasome, gene expression profiles were generated, comparing changes of mRNA expression of 7900 genes from the UniGene collection upon exposure of cells to the proteasome inhibitors Lactacystin, Lactacystin-β-lactone or MG132 by means of microarray based cDNA hybridization. The three profiles were very similar, but differed significantly from a gene expression profile generated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trapoxin A, indicating that the observed alterations were indeed due to proteasome inhibition. Two of the most prominently induced genes encoded the growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein Gadd153 and the activating transcription factor ATF3, both transcription factors of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family. A third gene encoded for the transcriptional repressor and c-Myc antagonist Mad1. Our results suggest that proteasome inhibition leads to upregulation of specific members of transcription factor families controlling cellular stress response and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2085813943,"p51A, or TAp63γ, a translation product of gene p51, or p63, was identified as a homolog of p53 in its primary structure and transactivating function. p53 plays a decision-making role in inducing either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage, and thereby preserves genome integrity of living cells. To compare the biological activities between p51A and p53, cell lines with low-level, constitutive expression of each protein were obtained by cDNA transfection of mouse erythroleukemic cells. Production of p51A with an apparent molecular mass of 57-kilodalton (kD) accompanied induction of p21waf1 and appearance of hemoglobin-producing cells. After DNA-damaging treatment either with ultraviolet light (UV) irradiation or with actinomycin D, the p51A protein accumulated in time courses corresponding to those of wild-type p53, and caused an increase in the hemoglobin-positive cell count. In contrast, p53-accumulated cells underwent apoptosis without exhibiting the feature of erythroid differentiation. The mode of p21waf1 and Bax-α upregulations varied between p51A- and p53-expressing cells and between the types of DNA damage. These results suggest the possibility that p51A induces differentiation under genotoxic circumstances. There may be cellular factors that control p51A protein stability and transactivating ability."
https://openalex.org/W2057222323,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine that exerts its effects through a heteromeric complex of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. At least two intracellular pathways are activated by TGF-β as follows: the SAPK/JNK, involving the MEKK1, MKK4, and JNK cascade, and the Smad pathway. Here, we report that the SAPK/JNK pathway inhibits the Smad3 pathway. Expression of dominant negative or constitutively active mutants of kinases of the SAPK/JNK pathway, respectively, activates or represses a TGF-β-induced reporter containing Smad3-binding sites. This effect is not dependent on blocking of Smad3 nuclear translocation but involves a functional interaction between Smad3 and c-Jun, a transcription factor activated by the SAPK/JNK pathway. Overexpression of constitutively active MEKK1 or MKK4 mutants stabilizes the physical interaction between Smad3 and c-Jun, whereas dominant negative mutants inhibit this interaction. Moreover, overexpression of wild-type c-Jun inhibits Smad3-dependent transcription. However, c-Jun does not inhibit Smad3 binding to DNA in vitro. The repression obtained with a c-Jun mutant unable to activate transcription through AP-1 sites indicates that the inhibitory mechanism does not rely on the induction of a Smad3 repressor by c-Jun, suggesting that c-Jun could act as a Smad3 co-repressor. The inhibition of the Smad3 pathway by the SAPK/JNK pathway, both triggered by TGF-β, could participate in a negative feedback loop to control TGF-β responses.

Signaling by these cytokines is transduced by heteromeric complexes of transmembrane Ser/Thr kinase receptors (1Derynck R. Feng X.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 2Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3983) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, type II receptor phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor which then propagates signals to downstream targets, in particular the Smad proteins. Eight mammalian Smad proteins have been identified and divided into three classes (2Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3983) Google Scholar, 3Hata A. Shi Y. Massagué J. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The first class includes pathway-restricted proteins such as Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 that are specifically involved in BMP signaling and Smad2 and Smad3 that are restricted to TGF-β/activin pathway. The second class contains the common mediator Smad4 implicated in both BMP and TGF-β/activin pathways. The third class contains the inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7. After phosphorylation by TGF-β-activated type I receptor on their carboxyl-terminal SSXS sequence, pathway-restricted Smads form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and then translocate to the nucleus where they control expression of diverse genes (4Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar). TGF-β has also been described to initiate other pathways such as the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway (5Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This intracellular signaling proceeds through sequential activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MEKK1), a MAPK kinase (MKK4 or MKK7), and a MAPK (JNK). JNK then translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates several transcription factors including c-Jun, ATF-2, and Elk-1 (6Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). c-Jun homodimerizes with members of the Jun family or heterodimerizes with members of the Fos family. These complexes named activating protein-1 (AP-1) bind to the AP-1 DNA-binding site and control expression of a number of genes including c-jun itself. TGF-β has recently been shown to induce the transcriptional activation of the c-Jun promoter through AP-1 and Smad3/Smad4-binding sites (7Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.-M. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Smad proteins are key factors in TGF-β intracellular signaling, but the activity of Smad proteins is also modulated by other cytokines or growth factors. For example interferon-γ (IFNγ) inhibits TGF-β signaling by transcriptionally inducing Smad7 expression through the Jak1/STAT1 signaling pathway (8Ulloa L. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). By activating Ras, epidermal growth factor (EGF) can also act as an inhibitor of TGF-β signaling. Oncogene ras or EGF treatment leads to the activation of members of the Erk subfamily of MAPKs through Raf and MEK1. Erk2 has been shown to phosphorylate Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 at a different site than TGF-β type I receptor phosphorylation site. This EGF-induced phosphorylation prevents Smads translocation to the nucleus, thereby interrupting TGF-β signaling (9Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 10Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). In contrast another report indicates that EGF and hepatocyte growth factor trigger Smad2 phosphorylation on its carboxyl-terminal SSXS sequence through kinase(s) downstream of MEK1, thus promoting Smad2 nuclear translocation and its transcriptional activity (11De Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Therefore Smad proteins may be phosphorylated by kinases of the MAPK pathway on different sites leading to either their activation or their repression. In endothelial cells, MEKK1, a kinase of the SAPK/JNK pathway, also positively regulates Smad2 activation. MEKK1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation does not require the carboxyl-terminal SSXS sequence and promotes Smad2 association with Smad4 and the complex translocation to the nucleus (12Brown J.D. DiChiara M.R. Anderson K.R. Gimbrone M.A. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8797-8805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, Smad proteins integrate various extracellular signals leading either to their activation or their inhibition. TGF-β treatment of HepG2 cells induces the formation of a Smad3/Smad4-containing complex that activates transcription from the Smad-binding sites called CAGA boxes (13Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). In these cells TGF-β has also been shown to activate the SAPK/JNK pathway (5Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that these two TGF-β-activated pathways converge at the transcriptional level on CAGA sites. Surprisingly, whereas Smad3 synergizes with c-Jun on AP-1 site-mediated transcription, c-Jun represses Smad3 transcriptional activity on CAGA sites, suggesting that in this context, c-Jun may act as a Smad3 co-repressor. The (CAGA)9 MLP-Luc reporter was described previously (13Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). pAP-1-Luc containing seven copies of an AP-1 site was purchased from Stratagene. Expression vectors for dominant negative MEKK1, constitutively active MEKK1, and dominant negative MKK4 were described previously (5Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for partially active MKK4, constitutively active MEK, and c-Jun were a gift from Dr. Bohmann. Smad3 in pGEX4T-1 (a gift from Dr R. Derynck) was subcloned into pEGFP in frame with an amino-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag to generate pGFP-Smad3. Expression vector for human Smad3 was a gift from Dr P. ten Dijke. Expression vector for constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor was a gift from Dr. G. Wrana. Expression vectors for human c-FOS and human c-JUN were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from a human liver cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.) and subsequently cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Expression vectors for murine c-JUN and murine c-JUN CDL were gifts from Prof. M. Yaniv. The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was maintained in BME medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) or RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% FCS. The human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB468 was grown in a 7.5% CO2, 92.5% air atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (1:1) medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% FCS. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% FCS. For gene expression analysis, cells were plated to approximately 50% confluence and transfected a day later with expression vectors by the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.) or the FuGENE6 method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were subsequently serum-starved before induction with human TGF-β1 (2 or 5 ng/ml) for 16 h. Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay system (Promega). The luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of either β-galactosidase expression from pCMV5.LacZ control vector or Renilla luciferase expression from pRL-TK control vector. Experimental points were realized in triplicates in at least two independent transfections. Values given in figures are the arithmetic means, and the error bars represent standard deviations of a representative experiment. COS-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors using the LipofectAMINE method, and 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mg/ml aprotinin, and 20 mg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were then incubated with anti-c-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h, and immunocomplexes were immobilized on Sepharose-coupled protein G for 1 h. The beads were washed five times in lysis buffer, and samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Aliquots of cell lysates were subjected to direct immunoblotting to monitor transfection efficiency. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-HA (3F10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The bands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with GFP-Smad3 together with the indicated expression vectors. After 48 h, slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, and washed three times. To detect GFP staining, cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope. Nuclear extracts were prepared from control and 30-min TGF-β-treated HepG2 cells as described previously (13Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). c-Jun and Smad3 were also produced using the TNT T7 Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [α-33P]dCTP and [α-33P]dATP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. For binding reactions 10 μg of nuclear extracts (and/or in vitro synthesized proteins) were preincubated with or without 200 ng of cold probe or 2 μl of antibody (Smad2/Smad3 or c-Jun antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 20 min at 37 °C in final 40 μl of binding buffer (final concentrations: 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 30 mmKCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.8 mm NaPi, 20% glycerol, 4 mmspermidine, 3 μg of poly[d(I-C)]). Then 2 ng of labeled oligonucleotides were added for another 20 min at 37 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved in 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× TBE. The sequence of the double-stranded CAGA oligonucleotide used as a probe was 5′- TCGAGAGCCAGACAAGGAGCCAGACAAGGAGCCAGACAC-3′ and its complementary strand. The sequence of the double-stranded AP-1 oligonucleotide used as a probe was 5′-TCGAGTGACTAATGACTAATGACTAATGACTAATGACTAATGACTAATGACTAAC-3′ and its complementary strand. We have previously shown that in HepG2 cells, TGF-β activates the p3TP-Lux reporter vector through the SAPK/JNK pathway (5Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This vector contains three AP-1 sites from the collagenase-1 promoter. The activation of SAPK/JNK pathway by TGF-β promotes the activation of the c-Jun-containing factor AP-1. p3TP-Lux also contains a plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter sequence with a CAGA box recognized by a TGF-β-activated Smad3-Smad4 complex (13Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). Therefore to dissociate the effects of TGF-β on AP-1 or Smad3/Smad4-binding sites, we used the CAGA reporter containing exclusively nine copies of the Smad-binding site derived from the PAI-1 promoter (13Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the SAPK/JNK pathway could modulate the TGF-β-activation of this reporter. To test this hypothesis, HepG2 cells were transfected with an expression vector for a dominant negative form of MEKK1, and the activity of the CAGA reporter vector by TGF-β was studied (Fig. 1 B). MEKK1 is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family and an upstream activator of the SAPK/JNK pathway (Fig.1 A). Surprisingly, this exogenous expression led to a 2.5-fold increase of the CAGA reporter activation by TGF-β. In line with this observation, the expression of a constitutively active MEKK1 protein dramatically reduced the reporter activation by TGF-β (Fig.1 B). These results could indicate that the activation of JNK pathway may negatively regulate TGF-β-induced Smad pathway in HepG2 cells. MEKK1 phosphorylates MKK4 (Fig. 1 A), and this dual specificity kinase then phosphorylates and activates JNK (6; Fig.1 A). To provide further evidence that the activation of JNK pathway by TGF-β abrogates the CAGA reporter activation, we transfected an expression vector encoding a dominant negative form of MKK4. This protein is dominant negative with respect to JNK activation by TGF-β (14Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). As observed with the dominant negative form of MEKK1, expression of this MKK4 mutant promoted the CAGA reporter induction by TGF-β (Fig. 1 C). Expression of a partially active form of MKK4 reduced the reporter activation (Fig. 1 C). Thus MKK4 can mimic the MEKK1 effect, suggesting that the inhibition of the CAGA reporter activation by TGF-β may directly involve MKK4 or a downstream protein. MKK4 belongs to the same kinase family as MEK1, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase of the MAPK pathway. MEK1 activates the Erk kinase which in turn phosphorylates Smad3, thereby preventing its nuclear translocation (10Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Therefore, an attractive hypothesis is that MKK4 may inhibit Smad3 nuclear translocation leading to an inhibition of the TGF-β-induced activation of the CAGA reporter vector. To test this hypothesis, we studied Smad3 nuclear translocation in COS-7 cells in the presence or absence of partially active MKK4. As a control we expressed a constitutively active form of MEK1. In order to induce Smad3 nuclear translocation, we transfected the expression vector for the constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor that triggers intracellular cascade in the absence of TGF-β type II receptor and cytokine. As expected, expression of the activated type I receptor markedly increased Smad3 nuclear translocation, whereas expression of the activated MEK1 prevented this translocation (Fig.2). We did not observe an inhibition of Smad3 nuclear translocation with the activated MKK4 but rather a stronger nuclear staining. Thus MKK4 inhibitory effect on the CAGA reporter activation by TGF-β cannot be explained by an abrogation of Smad3 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, these data suggest that the JNK pathway does not favor Smad7 expression as this protein would prevent Smad3 nuclear translocation. Indeed it has been shown that IFNγ inhibits Smad pathway by inducing Smad7 expression (8Ulloa L. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In the JNK pathway, MKK4 activates JNK which then translocates into the nucleus where it phosphorylates several transcription factors, in particular c-Jun. This factor is particularly interesting because it is able to form a complex with Smad3 (15Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 16Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inhibitory effect observed involves c-Jun, we transfected a wild-type c-Jun expression vector together with the CAGA reporter in HepG2 cells. As expected, c-Jun activated transcription from AP-1 sites, but under the same experimental conditions c-Jun markedly inhibited the TGF-β-induced activation of the CAGA reporter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A). Thus TGF-β-initiated SAPK/JNK pathway activates the nuclear factor c-Jun which in turn inhibits the CAGA reporter activation by TGF-β. To test whether this repression could also be observed in a naturally occurring context, we studied a TGF-β-activated promoter. The PAI-1 is widely used because it is highly responsive to TGF-β induction. This promoter contains three CAGA sequences that are necessary for the TGF-β-dependent activation of the promoter (13Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar) in addition to other Smad3-binding sites (17Song C.-Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 3 B, overexpression of c-Jun mediated repression of this natural PAI-1 promoter, which is consistent with the hypothesis that activation of c-Jun by TGF-β can repress Smad3 transcriptional activity. As c-Jun is a transcription factor that activates many AP-1-containing target genes, its effect on Smad3 transcriptional activity could be the consequence of a c-Jun-dependent expression of a Smad3 repressor. In order to determine whether the c-Jun effect is mediated by such a protein, we transfected a vector encoding a c-Jun CDL mutant which is defective in activating transcription from AP-1 sites. The CDL mutant is truncated in the leucine zipper, thus unable to form active dimers. As expected the CDL mutant did not activate the AP-1 reporter but inhibited TGF-β-activated CAGA reporter (Fig.3 C). This result indicates that the expression of a gene activated by c-Jun through AP-1 sites is not involved in this repression and rather suggests a direct effect of c-Jun on Smad3. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that c-Jun represses the expression of a co-activator important for Smad3 transcriptional activity. We have previously reported that overexpression of Smad3 in the absence of TGF-β activates the CAGA-mediated transcription (13Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar, 20Dennler S. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. Oncogene. 1998; 18: 1643-1648Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In order to assess directly the effect of c-Jun on Smad3-mediated transcription, we co-transfected Smad3 and c-Jun expression vectors along with the CAGA reporter in the absence of cytokine thus preventing any TGF-β-induced signals aside from Smad3 activation. As shown in Fig.4 A, exogenous c-Jun inhibited the Smad3-activated CAGA reporter. In line with other reports, Smad3 potentiated c-Jun transcriptional activity on AP-1 sites (7Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.-M. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 15Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown a direct interaction between Smad3 and c-Jun (15Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 16Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We investigated the possibility that JNK pathway activation could modulate Smad3/c-Jun interaction. COS-7 cells were transfected with tagged Smad3 and c-Jun expression vectors in the absence or the presence of dominant negative and constitutively active MEKK1 and MKK4 expression vectors. As shown in Fig. 4 B, c-Jun co-precipitated with Smad3. Expression of constitutively active MEKK1 and MKK4 resulted in an increase of c-Jun co-precipitated with Smad3, indicating that JNK pathway activation might repress Smad3 transcriptional activity by stabilizing the c-Jun-Smad3 complex. Remarkably co-transfection of dominant negative MEKK1 and MKK4 mutants abrogated the Smad3-c-Jun complex formation. Overall these results suggest that the physical interaction between c-Jun and Smad3 is directly involved in the inhibitory effect observed on the Smad3-activated CAGA reporter. As Smad3 forms heteromers with Smad4 and c-Jun heterodimerizes with c-Fos, we considered that Smad4 or c-Fos could modulate c-Jun inhibition of Smad3 transcriptional activity. Overexpression of Smad3 in Smad4 homozygous null MDA MB468 cells activated the CAGA reporter in the absence of TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 4 C). As in HepG2 cells, overexpression of c-Jun reduced this activation indicating that Smad4 is not necessary for the c-Jun inhibition of Smad3-mediated transcription. We were next interested in determining whether c-Fos could synergize with c-Jun to inhibit CAGA activation. As expected c-Fos activated the AP-1 reporter in synergy with c-Jun. At doses where c-Fos activated the AP-1 reporter, we did not observe any effect of c-Fos alone on the TGF-β-induced CAGA reporter (Fig. 4 D). Co-transfection of c-Jun and c-Fos expression vectors did not lead to a stronger repression than c-Jun alone indicating that, at low doses, c-Fos did not synergize with c-Jun to inhibit Smad3 transcriptional activity. However, at very high doses, c-Fos repressed the TGF-β-induced CAGA reporter and did not show a clear additive effect with c-Jun (Fig. 4 D). It should be noted that this repression is observed at much higher doses than those required for AP-1 activation. This would suggest that c-Fos like c-Jun may inhibit TGF-β-induced transcription although c-Fos is a weaker inhibitor. In an attempt to elucidate this inhibitory mechanism, we performed the following additional experiments. Direct interaction of c-Jun with Smad3 could prevent Smad3 transcriptional activity by interfering with Smad3-binding to DNA. As shown in Fig. 5and already described before (13Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar), a TGF-β-induced complex containing Smad3 bound specifically to an oligonucleotide containing CAGA sites. As expected, in vitro translated c-Jun was able to bind specifically to an AP-1 probe, whereas Smad3 did not bind (see the competition with cold probe and interference with c-Jun antibody in Fig. 5, right panel). However, we did not observe any effect of c-Jun on Smad3 DNA binding to CAGA boxes in gel shift experiments when we added c-Jun, whatever the source of proteins, i.e. in vitro translated or cell extracts (Fig. 5 and data not shown). These results would suggest that c-Jun does not inhibit Smad3 binding to its target sites in vivo but represses Smad3 transcriptional activity by a mechanism yet to be discovered. TGF-β initiates intracellular signaling leading to transcriptional regulation of many genes (20Dennler S. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M.

In several reports, AP-1 sites have been involved in TGF-β-transcriptional activation (7Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.-M. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell.

Several lines of evidence indicate that c-Jun, a transcription factor that binds to AP-1 site, is a downstream target of the TGF-β signaling pathway. First TGF-β induces c-Jun expression through transcriptional activation of the c-Jun promoter which contains both AP-1 and Smad3-binding sites (7Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.-M. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Second TGF-β initiation of the JNK pathway leads to c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser-63 and Ser-73 that increases its transcriptional activity (5Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Finally, TGF-β induces the activation of Smad3 and its subsequent interaction and cooperation with c-Jun on AP-1 sites (15Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 16Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These last years have seen the emergence of the Smad2 and Smad3 transcriptional regulators as critical factors in TGF-β signaling. In particular, several TGF-β-induced promoters are regulated by Smad3, a transcription factor that binds to specific DNA sequences such as the CAGA box present in promoters including PAI-1, JunB, collagen, or Smad7. We therefore wondered whether the JNK pathway could modulate activation of the Smad pathway. In the present study we report that the activation of the SAPK/JNK pathway represses the Smad pathway. Overexpression of constitutively active mutants of MEKK1 and MKK4 inhibited TGF-β-induced transcription, whereas overexpression of dominant negative versions of these kinases had an opposite effect. We have obtained a stronger repression with the constitutively active MEKK1 mutant compared with the MKK4 mutant (see Fig. 1, B and C). This could be attributed to the fact that the MKK4 mutant is partially active, leading to a weaker activation of the JNK pathway than the MEKK1 mutant (30Leppä S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Alternatively, MEKK1 could initiate, in addition to the MKK4/JNK pathway, another signaling involved in Smad3 repression. We have not been able to observe a modulation of Smad3 transcriptional activity by overexpression of a wild-type or a kinase-inactive version of JNK (data not shown), but both JNK constructs were also inactive on AP-1-mediated transcription, contrary to data obtained for MEKK1 and MKK4 mutants. This suggests that, in our systems, these JNK proteins do not have the potential to modulate c-Jun transcriptional activity. We are thus unable at present to test the ability of overexpressed wild-type JNK to inhibit CAGA reporter. Identification of a mutant that constitutively activates JNK protein would help clarify this issue. Our data indicate that the cross-talk between Smad and JNK pathways occurs in the nucleus and that overexpression of c-Jun, which specifically interacts with Smad3, inhibits Smad3-mediated transcription. By using a transcriptionally inactive c-Jun mutant, we have excluded that c-Jun modulates Smad3 transcriptional activity by the neosynthesis of a Smad3 repressor. Remarkably, overexpression of the dominant negative MEKK1 and MKK4 mutants, which potentiate TGF-β-induced transcription, disrupts the physical interaction between c-Jun and Smad3. In contrast, constitutively active MEKK1 and MKK4 mutants inhibit TGF-β-induced transcription and stabilize the c-Jun-Smad3 complex. These results indicate that interaction between Smad3 and c-Jun may repress Smad3 transcriptional activity. Although we have not addressed the phosphorylation state of c-Jun in the present paper, it will be interesting to study the effect of phosphorylation on this interaction. c-Fos, which heterodimerizes with c-Jun, seems able to repress TGF-β-induced transcription, although we observed a repression only at much higher doses than those required to activate an AP-1 reporter. Taken together with published reports, our results show that whereas Smad3 promotes c-Jun transcriptional activity on AP-1 sites, c-Jun inhibits Smad3-mediated transcription. Brown et al. (12Brown J.D. DiChiara M.R. Anderson K.R. Gimbrone M.A. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8797-8805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) have previously reported that MEKK1 could stimulate Smad2-mediated transcriptional activation in endothelial cells. These observations diverge from ours since we report a repression of Smad3 transcriptional activity by c-Jun and the JNK pathway in HepG2 cells. However, Smad2 and Smad3 may be differently regulated, and the different cellular contexts of the two studies may be important. Our data describing a repression of Smad3 activity fit with several recent papers revealing transmodulation of Smad pathway by other signaling pathways. As published by Kretzschmar and co-workers (9Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 10Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), Smad transcriptional activity is repressed by EGF-induced phosphorylation of Smad proteins in the linker region. This phosphorylation by Erk kinases prevents Smad translocation to the nucleus (9Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 10Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Another paper (8Ulloa L. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) describes that Smad activation can be inhibited by IFNγ, the latter promoting Smad7 expression. Thus, both EGF and IFNγ prevent Smad translocation to the nucleus. In our experiments we have excluded the possibility that the repression of Smad activity is mediated by Smad3 retention in the cytoplasm. Other mechanisms of transmodulation might also exist since a recent study indicates that ecotropic viral integration site-1 (Evi-1), a zinc finger protein, interacts with Smad3 MH2 domain and represses Smad3 DNA binding activity (31Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In the present study, c-Jun inhibition of Smad3 transcriptional activity does not seem to rely on the same mechanism since we have not detected a reduction of Smad3 binding to DNA in vitro. Smad3 has also been shown to interact with several transcription factors including c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF-2, and vitamin D receptor (32Ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 33Datto M. Wang X.-F. Cytokine & Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Comparable to what we report here, a recent paper (34Song C.-Z. Tian X. Gelehrter T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11776-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) describes the inhibition of Smad3 transcriptional activity by the glucocorticoid receptor, involving a physical interaction between both transcription factors. Several proteins may thus modulate Smad3 transcriptional activity by various mechanisms. In particular, transcriptional activity of Smad proteins depends on co-activators such as CBP/p300 and co-repressors such as TGIF, Ski, or SnoN (32Ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H.

It has been proposed that these proteins control transcription by modifying the access to chromatin by acetylation (co-activator) or deacetylation (co-repressors) of core nucleosomal histones. Since c-Jun also interacts with CBP/p300, c-Jun may modify the interaction of Smad3 with its co-activators or co-repressors. However, it remains to be shown whether the acetylation state of histones may be involved in the c-Jun silencing of TGF-β transcriptional responses. Nevertheless, our results are the first revealing a repression of Smad3 transcriptional activity by a TGF-β-activated transcription factor. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that JNK pathway triggers additional components required for full Smad3 transcriptional activity, our data and the physical interaction between c-Jun and Smad3 favor the hypothesis that c-Jun may act as a direct co-repressor of Smad3 activity by a yet unknown mechanism. In addition to our data obtained on the native PAI-1 promoter, c-Jun has already been reported to inhibit the TGF-β induction of the α2 type I collagen promoter (26Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Since TGF-β activates both Smad3 and c-Jun, we propose a model in which Smad3 transcriptional repression by c-Jun may participate in a feedback control mechanism (Fig. 6). First TGF-β induces the activation of both Smad3 and c-Jun which modulate transcription of various genes including c-jun itself (7Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.-M. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). As the activation of JNK pathway promotes the accumulation of c-Jun, Smad3 transcriptional activity is repressed leading to silencing of some TGF-β effects. Although the exact mechanism through which c-Jun acts to repress Smad3 transcriptional activity and the kinetics of the interactions remain to be established, the finding that JNK pathway inhibits Smad3-mediated gene expression provides new insights into TGF-β-regulated gene expression.

The amino-terminal domain of human p14ARF and of the mouse homologue, p19ARF, is sufficient for these effects. This domain is also sufficient for the nucleolar localization of the mouse ARF protein.

The amino-terminal nucleolar-targeting domain of p14ARF is also important for ARF-hdm2 binding and cell cycle inhibition.

Furthermore, protein aggregation during production, shipping, storage, and delivery of therapeutic proteins is a problem of significant economic importance (9Manning M.C. Patel K. Borchardt R.T.

To develop strategies for preventing protein aggregation, the mechanism(s) and pathways by which proteins aggregate must be characterized. Such characterization is complicated because light scattering interferes with many of the optical techniques that are now standard for examining protein folding pathways, e.g. fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies. In contrast, infrared (IR)1spectroscopy is insensitive to light scattering and thus provides a valuable method for studying protein aggregation. IR spectroscopy can be used to study not only the secondary structure of proteins in the soluble, native state (12Susi H. Byler D.M.

However, a shortcoming of IR spectroscopy is that relatively high protein concentrations (e.g. 20 mg/ml in H2O) are needed to obtain high quality spectra. With such high concentrations of protein, perturbations used to induce structural transitions leading to aggregation (e.g. high temperature) cause a rapid conversion of native protein to insoluble aggregates that are rich in intermolecular β-sheet (16Ismail A.A.

Flatmark T. Arrondo J.L.R. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19737-19742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This conversion is so rapid with respect to typical IR spectral acquisition (e.g. 5 min) that intermediates in the aggregation pathway usually cannot be detected. Yet, current theoretical and experimental mechanisms for protein aggregation suggest that aggregates are formed from partially folded intermediates (23Fink A.L. Folding Design. 1998; 3: R9-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Thus, what is needed to capitalize on the advantages of IR spectroscopy for the study of protein aggregation is a means of populating these folding intermediates sufficiently for IR spectroscopic characterization. To address this issue, in the current study we combined thermal and chemical approaches to allow population of aggregation pathway intermediates. With this approach, the model protein pool for the unfolding studies may be expanded to include proteins with a wide range of secondary structural compositions and various degree of resistance to chemical denaturants. Here, we present the results of studies in which we compared unfolding and aggregation of three α-helix predominant proteins (myoglobin, cytochrome c, and lysozyme) in the presence or absence of 1.0 m GdnHCl using IR spectroscopy. A 1.0 m GdnHCl concentration is chosen because earlier studies have shown that at this concentration of GdnHCl and room temperature, both myoglobin and cytochrome c are not unfolded (24Gupta R. Yadav S. Ahmad F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11925-11930Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Ahmad Z. Ahmad F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1207: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here we will show that elevation of the temperature above 25 °C allows partial unfolding to occur, whereas the presence of GdnHCl both lowers the temperature at which transitions occur and inhibits the conversion of these partially folded intermediates to aggregates. Cytochrome c(type VI, horse heart), myoglobin (horse heart), and lysozyme (chicken egg white) were purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. Guanidine hydrochloride was SigmaUltra grade from Sigma. The stock solutions of proteins were prepared by dissolving lyophilized protein powder in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) at concentration of 40 mg/ml and followed by filtration with a 0.20-μm syringe filter. The stock solution of GdnHCl was prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate at concentration of 2.0m, and pH was adjusted with KOH solution. GdnHCl concentration was determined using a refractometer and following equation (26Nozaki Y. Methods Enzymol. 1972; XXVI, Part C: 43-50Crossref Scopus (578) Google Scholar). [GdnHCl]=57.147(ΔN)3+38.68(ΔN)3−91.60(ΔN)3Equation 1 where ΔN is the difference between the refractive index of a GdnHCl solution and that of water. Samples for infrared analysis were prepared by mixing together the stock solutions of protein and GdnHCl at 1:1 ratio and equilibrated for at least 30 min before measurement. The final concentrations of the proteins were 20 mg/ml, and the GdnHCl was 1.0 m. IR spectra were measured with a Bomem IR spectrometer equipped with a dTGS detector. Protein samples were placed in a P/N 20500 heatable cell with CaF2 windows and a 6-μm spacer. For each spectrum, a 128-scan interferogram was collected in single beam mode with a 4 cm−1 resolution. Reference spectra were recorded under identical scan conditions with only the buffer or 1.0 m GdnHCl buffer in the cell. The chosen temperature at which a spectrum was acquired was controlled within 0.5 °C using a custom built Peltier IR cell temperature controller. Spectral acquisition at a given temperature required approximately 6 min (i.e. dwell time at the given temperature). The average heating rate between spectral acquisition temperatures was 1.5 °C/min. Protein spectra were obtained according to previously established criteria and double subtraction procedure (15Dong A. Caughey W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 139-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 27Dong A. Huang P. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3303-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). For the best result the spectra of buffer and 1.0m GdnHCl buffer were subtracted from the spectrum of protein separately. The second derivative spectra were obtained with a 7-point Savitsky-Golay derivative function and then base line corrected as described previously (17Dong A. Prestrelski S. Allison S.D. Carpenter J.F. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 84: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the infrared absorbance spectra of myoglobin, cytochrome c, and lysozyme in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) as a function of temperature. The two strong bands centered near the 1656 and 1548 cm−1 are the so-called the amide I and II bands, respectively. The amide I band arises primarily from the C=O stretching vibration of the peptide linkages that constitute the backbone structure of proteins and is known to be sensitive to the secondary structural composition and conformational changes of proteins (12Susi H. Byler D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 290-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 15Dong A. Caughey W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 139-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar,28Krimm S. Bendekar J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 181-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). The amide II band arises mainly from an out-of-phase combination of N-H in-plane bending and C-N stretching vibrations of peptide linkages (28Krimm S. Bendekar J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 181-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar) and is less useful in protein structural analysis. At 25 °C all three proteins exhibited the amide I band maximum near the 1656 cm−1, a frequency characteristic to proteins containing predominantly α-helical structures (27Dong A. Huang P. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3303-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Elevation of temperature to ∼80 °C resulted similar spectral changes in all three proteins. The amide I absorbance maximum near 1656 cm−1 decreased as a function of temperature, accompanied by intensity increase at 1623 and 1694 cm−1. In addition, a temperature-dependent intensity decrease and frequency red shift at the amide II bands were observed for all three proteins. The changes at the amide II region seem to be nonspecific to thermally induced protein unfolding and aggregation, because similar changes were also reported for the recombinant human factor XIII, a predominantly β-sheet protein (29Dong A. Kendrick B. Kreilgard L. Matsuura J. Manning M.C. Carpenter J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the second derivative amide I spectra of the three proteins in the absence of GdnHCl. Assignments of the amide I components can be made on the basis of previous infrared studies of over 50 proteins in H2O-based solution (15Dong A. Caughey W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 139-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar,27Dong A. Huang P. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3303-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). 2A. Dong, J. F. Carpenter, and W. S. Caughey, unpublished observation. The bands near 1656 cm−1 are assigned to α-helix structure. The bands between 1670 and 1685 cm−1 are due to β-turn structure. At 25 °C all three proteins exhibit a strong amide I band near 1656 cm−1. At temperatures between 35 and 50 °C, the intensities of the 1656 cm−1 bands increases slightly from that of the native state at 25 °C. As temperature increases to above 55 °C, the intensities of the 1656-cm−1 bands decrease dramatically. For myoglobin and cytochrome c, there is a concomitant appearance of two new bands at 1623 cm−1 (the low wave number β-sheet component) and the 1694 cm−1(the high wave number β-sheet component), indicative of intermolecular β-sheet (see “Discussion”) in protein aggregates (17Dong A. Prestrelski S. Allison S.D. Carpenter J.F. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 84: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 31Clark A.H. Saunderson D.P.H. Suggett A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1981; 17: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 32Damaschun G. Damaschun H. Fabian H. Gast K. Krober R. Wieske M. Zirwer D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 39: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The latter become a predominant spectral feature of thermally aggregated states of myoglobin and cytochrome c. When cooled from 80 to 25 °C, the two β-sheet aggregate bands remain unchanged in their intensity but shifted ∼2 cm−1to a lower wave number (data not shown). In addition to the appearance of IR bands assigned to intermolecular β-sheet, the presence of aggregated protein in the samples was documented by the observation that the cooled samples formed gels, which are characteristic extensive intermolecular interactions in protein samples. For lysozyme, bands indicative of intermolecular β-sheet do not appear in any significant intensity, even though the pronounced loss of native α-helix is irreversible (data not shown). The lack of well resolved bands suggest that the structure of thermally perturbed lysozyme is comprised of a heterogeneous ensemble of proteins with non-native β-turns, extended strands, and residual α-helix. An important feature of the IR spectra of all three thermally treated proteins in the absence of GdnHCl is the isosbestic points at 1688, 1664, 1648, and 1639 cm−1. This observation suggests that heat treatment of the three proteins results in a transition between only two readily detectable states: the native and aggregated. To foster structural transitions and permit detection of unfolding/aggregation intermediate(s) during heating, we added a nondenaturing concentration of chemical denaturant GdnHCl (1.0 m) into the protein solution. In contrast to the aggregation induced by elevated temperature alone, the amide I absorbance maxima of the three proteins in the presence of 1.0 m GdnHCl shift to a higher wave number as a function of temperature (data not shown). Fig.3 shows the second derivative spectra of the three proteins in the amide I region as a function of temperature in the presence of 1.0 m GdnHCl. Comparison of the spectra recorded at 25 °C with (Fig. 3) or without GdnHCl (Fig. 2) reveals that the presence of a nondenaturing concentration of GdnHCl does not alter the native structures of myoglobin and cytochrome cand causes only a small loss of native α-helix (∼5%) in lysozyme. As the temperature increases, however, the proteins exhibit unfolding patterns distinctly different from those noted in the absence of GdnHCl. As intensities decrease, the maximum absorbance of predominant amide I components shift from near 1656 cm−1 to 1663 cm−1 and eventually to near 1667 cm−1. Intermolecular β-sheet bands (1623 and 1694 cm−1) in myoglobin spectra appear at temperatures above 55 °C, and the band at 1666 cm−1 becomes more intense. However, the intermolecular β-sheet bands are less intense than those noted at the same temperatures in the absence of GdnHCl. With cytochromec and lysozyme, even at elevated temperatures, no intermolecular β-sheet bands appear. Fig. 4 shows a plot of the frequency of the most prominent amide I component as a function of temperature. It clearly shows that, within the temperature range of the experiment, the major secondary structural components of the thermally perturbed state are represented by the bands near 1667 cm−1 for myoglobin and lysozyme and the band at 1663 cm−1 for cytochromec. On the basis of theoretical (28Krimm S. Bendekar J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 181-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar) and infrared spectroscopic studies (15Dong A. Caughey W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 139-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 33Kennedy D.F. Crisma M. Toniolo C. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6541-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), the band component at 1662 ± 3 cm−1 can be assigned to the 310-helix structure, and the band near 1667 cm−1 can be assigned to the β-turn structures (27Dong A. Huang P. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3303-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Differing from the α-helix in that the hydrogen bond is of the 4 → 1 type rather than the 5 → 1 type, 310-helix is also less common in proteins than α-helix (34Barlow D.J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 601-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, 310-helix structure has been found by x-ray crystallographic analysis, for example, in peptides containing α-aminoisobutyric acid residues (35Shamala N. Nagaraj R. Balaram P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 79: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Bosch R. Jung G. Winter W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. C Cryst. Struct. Commun. 1983; C 39: 776-778Crossref Google Scholar) and in globular proteins such as α-lactalbumin (31% α-helix and 20% 310-helix) (37Archarya K.R. Stuart D.I. Walker N.P.C. Lewis M. Phillips D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 99-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). By examining the IR spectra of synthetic peptides containing α-aminoisobutyric acid residues, Kennedy and colleagues (33Kennedy D.F. Crisma M. Toniolo C. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6541-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) showed that the peptides have an amide I band maximum between 1666 and 1662 cm−1. Prestrelski and co-workers (38Prestrelski S.J. Tedeschi N. Arakawa T. Carpenter J.F. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 661-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) reported that the deconvoluted spectrum of α-lactalbumin in H2O solution exhibited a strong amide I band component near 1661 cm−1. Our spectral analysis of α-lactalbumin in H2O agreed with the band assignment of 1662 ± 3 cm−1 to 310-helix (data not shown). Based on this supporting evidence, we conclude that our current data document that in the presence of 1.0 GdnHCl the conformations of the myoglobin, cytochrome c, and lysozyme undergo major structural changes from α-helices to 310-helices and then to a β-turn structure as temperature increases. Fig. 5 shows the overlay of second derivative spectra of the three proteins in the presence of 1.0m GdnHCl at 25 and 75 °C and after cooling from 75 to 25 °C. The result shows that the reversibility of the thermally induced transition depends on the conformation of the thermally perturbed state. Myoglobin structure at 75 °C contains intermolecular β-sheet and upon cooling does not revert to the native α-helix conformation with or without 1.0 m GdnHCl. Cytochrome c in 1.0 m GdnHCl at 75 °C contains 310-helices, which revert to native α-helix upon cooling. When lysozyme is heated to 75 °C in 1.0 mGdnHCl, there is a conformational transition to a β-turn structure that is partially reversible upon cooling. Fig. 6 shows a plot of the relative intensity of the α-helix bands of three proteins with and without GdnHCl as a function of temperature. The intensities of α-helix bands in the presence of GdnHCl were calculated at fixed frequency to discount effects of frequency shift. The result shows that, for all three proteins in the absence of GdnHCl, thermally induced loss of α-helix occurs at temperatures between 65 and 80 °C with a midpoint around 72 °C. In the presence of GdnHCl, however, the structural transition starts at much lower temperature for all three proteins, especially for myoglobin. The midpoints of transition as monitored by the intensity changes at the α-helix bands are about 65 °C for cytochrome c and lysozyme and about 40 °C for myoglobin. The thermally induced aggregation processes of the majority of the proteins studied by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy can be described with a two-state model. The predominant secondary structural element (α-helix or β-sheet) decreases as a function of temperature and is concomitantly replaced by intermolecular β-sheet because of protein aggregation (16Ismail A.A. Mantsch H.H. Wong P.T.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Dong A. Prestrelski S. Allison S.D. Carpenter J.F. J. Pharmacol.

The latter is evident by the appearance of a strong band near 1624 ± 8 cm−1 (low wave number β-sheet component) accompanied by a weak band near 1693 ± 5 cm−1 (high wave number β-sheet component). Intermolecular β-sheet structure is a common secondary structural element in the aggregated state of proteins (16Ismail A.A. Mantsch H.H. Wong P.T.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Dong A. Prestrelski S. Allison S.D. Carpenter J.F. J. Pharmacol.

Acta. 1996; 1294: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The formation of intermolecular β-sheet structure in thermally induced protein aggregates was clearly demonstrated by Clark and colleagues (40Clark A.H. Saunderson D.P.H. Suggett A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1980; 16: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) using small angle x-ray scattering. Later, they reported a close relationship between the thermally induced intermolecular β-sheet aggregates and appearance of a new, well defined amide I band component near 1620 cm−1 (31Clark A.H. Saunderson D.P.H. Suggett A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1981; 17: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). More recently, Damaschun et al. (32Damaschun G. Damaschun H. Fabian H. Gast K. Krober R. Wieske M. Zirwer D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 39: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) studied fibrils of phosphoglycerate kinase with small angle x-ray scattering and provided similar corroboration for assignment to the high and low wave number IR bands noted above to intermolecular β-sheet. Our data for the thermally induced structural transitions in myoglobin and cytochromec in the absence of GdnHCl suggest a direct transition from the native conformation to intermolecular β-sheet aggregates, evidenced by the isosbestic points visible for both proteins (Figs. 1and 2). Lysozyme in the absence of GdnHCl also shows isosbestic evidence of a two-state transition (Figs. 1 and 2). The amount of β-sheet aggregate present in the thermally perturbed state of lysozyme is negligible, however, judging by the weak band near 1625 cm−1 (low wave number β-sheet component). The major secondary structural elements in the thermally perturbed state of lysozyme are represented by two broad bands at 1657 and 1685 cm−1, assignable to the residual α-helix and β-turn structure, respectively (15Dong A. Caughey W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 139-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the random (unordered) structure observed in the thermally aggregated state of other proteins (16Ismail A.A. Mantsch H.H. Wong P.T.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Dong A. Prestrelski S. Allison S.D. Carpenter J.F. J. Pharmacol.

Fritzsche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1294: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) is not a major element in the thermally perturbed state of the three α-helix proteins studied here. Unordered structure is generally associated with an amide I component at 1645 ± 4 cm−1 for proteins in D2O solution (12Susi H. Byler D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 290-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and 1648 ± 2 cm−1for proteins in H2O solution (15Dong A. Caughey W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 139-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The latter assignment is supported by the IR spectrum of the model compound poly-l-lysine in H2O solution at neutral pH (38Prestrelski S.J. Tedeschi N. Arakawa T. Carpenter J.F. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 661-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), in which the polypeptide is known to be a random coil (41Tiffiany M.L. Krimm S. Biopolymers. 1969; 8: 347-359Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 42Epand R.M. Wheeler G.E. Moscarello R.M. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 43Shibata A. Yamamoto M. Yamashita T. Chiou J.-S. Kamaya H. Ueda I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5728-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The lack of random coil as a major structural element in the thermally aggregated state has also been reported for the β-sheet predominant protein, recombinant human Factor XIII (29Dong A. Kendrick B. Kreilgard L. Matsuura J. Manning M.C. Carpenter J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We should point out that the so-called loop structure, which may be classified as part of random structure, could also contribute to the band intensity near 1658 cm−1 (14Prestrelski S.J. Byler D.M. Liebman M.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 44Dong A. Huang P. Caughey W.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 45Wilder C.L. Friederich A.D. Potts R.O. Daumy G.O. Francoeur M.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Previous IR spectroscopic studies on superoxide dismutase have also shown that the random/loop structure is represented by a part of the 1658 cm−1 band (accounts for 13 of random/loop), in combination with a more prominent band at 1647 cm−1 (accounts for 23 of random/loop) (44Dong A. Huang P. Caughey W.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, with existing IR spectroscopic data on a large number of proteins in H2O solution,2 a protein with a significant amount of random/loop structure that does not exhibit a major band in the 1648 ± 2 cm−1 has not been observed. The spectra of the thermally perturbed states of proteins in the current study do not have a band in 1648 ± 2 cm−1 region of their IR spectra. Thus, the remaining bands near 1656 cm−1 in their spectra are more likely associated with the residual α-helix structure than with newly formed unordered/loop structure. Addition of 1.0 m GdnHCl in conjunction with elevated temperatures results in significant accumulation of non-native species rich in 310-helix and β-turn structures, which we suggest are intermediates between the native protein and aggregated states for myoglobin and cytochrome c. Similar structures are seen in lysozyme, although intermolecular β-sheet aggregates are not formed in the temperature range we tested. It is worth noting that similar spectral features have been previously observed in GdnHCl-induced unfolded state of iso-1-cytochrome c (46Bowler B.E. Dong A. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2402-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Bowler and co-workers (46Bowler B.E. Dong A. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2402-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reported that as the concentration of GdnHCl increased, the intensity of the 1657 cm−1 band of iso-1-cytochromec because of α-helix structure was lost gradually and replaced by three main features at 1687, 1666, and 1660 cm−1, ascribable to β-turn, β-turn, and 310-helix, respectively. Furthermore, Millhauser (47Millhauser G.L.

In addition, molecular dynamics simulations have suggested that 310-helices exist as kinetic folding intermediates of analogous α-helical proteins (30Torado-Rives J. Jorgensen W.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3864-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,48Soman K.V. Karimi A. Case D.A. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1351-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Aggregation pathway intermediates containing 310-helix and β-turn structures that we observe may also be the intermediates on a folding pathway. For many proteins, it has been found that aggregates are formed from intermediates on the folding pathway (reviewed in Ref. 23Fink A.L. Folding Design. 1998; 3: R9-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated in the present study that IR spectroscopic investigations of protein aggregation using a combination of thermal and chemical denaturing factors can provide a means to populate and characterize aggregation intermediates. This method should be valuable for studying the aggregation processes of a wide range of proteins. We speculate that identification and characterization of aggregation intermediates may lead to new interdiction strategies for amyloidogenic human diseases, as well as to improvements in industrial processing, storage, and delivery of therapeutic proteins."

The role of calcium in transport between the Golgi cisternae, however, remains unclear. Using a well characterized cell-free intra-Golgi transport assay, we now show that changes in free Ca2+ concentration in the physiological range regulate this transport process. The calcium-chelating agent 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid blocked transport with an IC50 of approximately 0.8 mm. The effect of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid was reversible by addition of fresh cytosol and was irreversible when performed in the presence of a Ca2+ ionophore that depletes calcium from lumenal stores. We demonstrate here that intra-Golgi transport is stimulated by low Ca2+concentrations (20–100 nm) but is inhibited by higher concentrations (above 100 nm). Further, we show that calmodulin antagonists specifically block intra-Golgi transport, implying a role for calmodulin in mediating the effect of calcium.

Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar and 2Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fast and short (transient) increases in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration play a pivotal role in many physiological processes, and the dynamic characteristics of these pools are regulated in a well defined manner. Calcium sequestration into the ER1 lumen depends on Ca2+-ATPases, known as sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPases (for reviews see Ref. 2Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), all of which share the common property of being selectively inhibited by thapsigargin, a tumor-promoting sesquiterpene lactone (3Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium handling by the ER is also controlled by inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and ryanodine receptors (4Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar, 5Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fill M. Coronado R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13765-13768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although much is known about the ER as an intracellular Ca2+ storage pool, far less is known about calcium sequestration by the Golgi apparatus. Recent studies documented the presence of a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum adenosine triphosphatase isoform and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors on the Golgi and showed that they dynamically regulate calcium homeostasis of this organelle (8Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates the involvement of Ca2+ cations in different intracellular transport steps. For example, Ca2+ requirement was demonstrated for ER to Golgi transport and for the assembly of the nuclear envelope (9Schwaninger R. Beckers C.J. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13055-13063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sullivan K.M. Busa W.B. Wilson K.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1411-1422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies showed that both homotypic vacuolar fusion and fusion between early endosomes depend on Ca2+ and calmodulin (CaM), the ubiquitous calcium effector (11Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 12Colombo M.I. Beron W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 10: 3035-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the role played by Ca2+ in intra-Golgi transport remains unclear. The cell-free intra-Golgi transport assay was reported to be insensitive to the Ca2+ chelator EGTA (14Fries E. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ca2+ is not required for intra-Golgi transport, whereas based on evidence from semi-intact cells, Schwaninger et al.(9Schwaninger R. Beckers C.J. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13055-13063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that this cation is required at a late stage of transport within the Golgi. In this study we have characterized the requirement for calcium in transport within the Golgi. We present evidence that intra-Golgi transport require low free Ca2+ concentrations within the physiological range and that above a critical level (100 nm) Ca2+ has the reverse effect and inhibit transport. We thus show that free Ca2+ is required in a very narrow concentration range for this process and suggest a dual role for Ca2+ in intra-Golgi transport. In addition, we provide evidence that links CaM to the stimulatory effect of Ca2+ on transport. Rat brain cytosol was prepared essentially as described previously for bovine brain cytosol (15Porat A. Sagiv Y. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14457-14465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The standard intra-Golgi transport was performed as described previously (16Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). A standard intra-Golgi transport assay (25 μl) contained 2.5 mmHepes buffer, pH 7.0, 15 mm KCl, 2.5 mmmagnesium acetate, 0.4 μCi of UDP-[3H]N-acetylglucosamine, 5 μl of a 1:1 mixture of donor and acceptor Golgi membranes (2–3 μg of protein), 0.25 μl (30 ng) of His6αSNAP, 10 μm palmitoyl-coenzyme A, and ATP and UTP regenerating systems. Transport activity was dependent upon addition of cytosol, and in this study 27.5 μg of rat brain cytosol was added to achieve optimum conditions for the transport activity. The transport reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. [3H]N-Acetylglucosamine incorporated into VSV-G protein was determined as described previously (17Legesse-Miller A. Sagiv Y. Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Each of the transport assay experiments shown in this study represent at least three independent assays performed in duplicate. (Where standard errors are absent the results represent 3 independent experiments with duplicates. Standard errors did not exceed 5%.) For the glycosylation assay, “wild type donor” membranes were prepared as described by Taylor et al. (18Taylor T.C. Kanstein M. Weidman P. Melancon P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly Golgi membranes were isolated from wild type Chinese hampster ovary cells infected with VSV, after which the isolated “wild type donor” membranes were treated withN-ethylmaleimide (1 mm) for 15 min on ice, at which time dithiothreitol (2 mm) was added to quench any remaining N-ethylmaleimide. The glycosylation assay was performed under identical conditions as those described for the standard transport assay. The free cation concentrations were determined using the Bound and Determined (BAD) software (33Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To address the role of Ca2+ in intra-Golgi transport we tested the effects of EGTA and BAPTA, two Ca2+chelators, on the well characterized cell-free intra-Golgi transport assay (16Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Addition of increasing amounts of BAPTA inhibited transport with an IC50 of approximately 0.8 mm, whereas EGTA showed only a minimal effect (Fig.1 A). The inhibition of transport observed in the presence of BAPTA is not due to chelation of Mg2+ because a similar pattern was observed when BAPTA was added in the presence of 3 mm MgCl2. When BAPTA was added to the cell-free transport assay in the presence of an equivalent molar concentration of Ca2+, no inhibition was observed (Fig. 1 B). The different effects of these chelators on intra-Golgi transport cannot be explained by a different cation preference, because BAPTA and EGTA bind Ca2+ with a similar affinity at neutral pH. However, BAPTA has >100-fold higher ion association and dissociation rates than EGTA (19Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Thus, processes that are dependent on fast and local changes in Ca2+concentration will be sensitive to BAPTA but not to EGTA (20Hochner B. Parnas H. Parnas I. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 125: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Wang S.S. Thompson S.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1683-1697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The effect of BAPTA on intra-Golgi transport was fully reversible when the Golgi membranes were reisolated and incubated with fresh untreated cytosol (Fig. 1 C). However, when the membranes were incubated with BAPTA in the presence of 100 μm ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore that causes release of Ca2+from lumenal stores, fresh cytosol failed to restore transport. These results are consistent with the notion that low and transient Ca2+ effluxes, possibly from the Golgi membrane, are essential for intra-Golgi transport. To exclude the possibility that the inhibition of the assay signal by BAPTA resulted from decreased glycosylation activity of GlcNAc transferase rather than from inhibition of transport, we used a glycosylation assay that determines GlcNAc activity when membrane transport is inactivated (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1 D, neither BAPTA nor EGTA affected the glycosylation of VSV-G protein, indicating that BAPTA indeed exerts its effect on the process of intra-Golgi transport. To examine at which stage BAPTA acts in inhibiting intra-Golgi transport, we examined the effect of BAPTA when combined with two other inhibitors of transport (15Porat A. Sagiv Y. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14457-14465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Melancon P. Glick B.S. Malhotra V. Weidman P.J. Serafini T. Gleason M.L. Orci L. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the experiment described in Fig.2, the transport assay was either terminated at different time points by placing the reaction on ice, or at these time points the inhibitors BAPTA, anti-SBP56 antibodies, or GTPγS were added as indicated, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h. Control samples treated with buffer only were incubated likewise at 30° C until the end of the 2-h incubation period and served to represent 100% of transport activity. All three inhibitors, when added at the onset of the reaction, produced 90% inhibition of transport. The reaction became resistant to BAPTA after the inhibition by GTPγS and anti-SBP56 antibodies, indicating that Ca2+ is required late in the transport process, possibly at the fusion stage. It has been demonstrated that different organelles, including the Golgi apparatus, accumulate Ca2+ in their lumen (8Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To test the role of the lumenal Ca2+ pool in intra-Golgi transport, Golgi membranes were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of either ionomycin (a Ca2+ ionophore) or thapsigargin (a tumor-promoting sesquiterpene lactone that binds with high affinity and irreversibly inhibits all sarco/endoplasmic reticulum adenosine triphosphatase pumps). These two compounds are known to reduce lumenal Ca2+ levels selectively from intracellular organelles. As shown in Fig. 3, both ionomycin and thapsigargin inhibited intra-Golgi transport with IC50 values of 35 and 50 μm, respectively, with no effect on glycosylation by GlcNAc transferase. These results clearly indicated that lumenal Ca2+ was essential for this process. Having demonstrated that release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores may play a role in regulating transport, we examined the concentration of free Ca2+ required for intra-Golgi transport. For that purpose we added increasing CaCl2concentrations to the cell-free transport assay in the presence of 5 mm BAPTA or EGTA (Fig. 4,A and B). Interestingly addition of 100 nm free Ca2+ caused the assay signal to return to almost maximal levels (88% of the control determined in the absence of any Ca2+ chelator), but addition of higher free Ca2+ concentrations significantly inhibited the cell-free transport assay. When tested, neither Mn2+ nor Cu2+ was able to substitute Ca2+ (Fig.4 A). We then tested the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ using EGTA as cation chelator. Under these conditions the stimulatory effect of Ca2+ could not be observed. However, as found in the presence of BAPTA, free Ca2+concentrations above 100 nm inhibited transport, reaching a maximum effect at about 200 nm free Ca2+ (Fig. 4 B). These results clearly demonstrated that within the physiological range, Ca2+plays a dual role in regulating intra-Golgi transport. Furthermore, the ability of BAPTA but not EGTA to inhibit transport by chelating Ca2+ suggests that the effect of Ca2+ in regulating membrane fusion is localized to the vicinity of the membrane. A number of studies using endosomal fusion (12Colombo M.I. Beron W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7707-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or yeast vacuole homotypic fusion (11Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) have demonstrated a requirement for the cytosolic Ca2+ effector, CaM. We therefore examined the involvement of CaM in intra-Golgi transport. For that purpose, increasing concentrations of two specific CaM inhibitors, W7 or trifluoperazine dimaleate, were added to the cell-free transport assay. As shown in Fig. 5 A, 25 μm either W7 or trifluoperazine dimaleate inhibited up to 90% of the total transport activity with an IC50 of about 10 μm. Addition of W5, a much weaker CaM antagonist, however, only partially inhibited transport (IC50 > 250 μm) thus indicating that the inhibition observed in the presence of the different antagonists is CaM-mediated. Notably, W7 or trifluoperazine dimaleate failed to significantly inhibit the glycosylation of VSV-G protein as determined by the glycosylation assay (data not shown). To further verify the involvement of CaM in this process, we performed a two-stage transport assay in which Golgi membranes were first treated with or without W7 (30 min on ice) in transport assay conditions. The membranes were then reisolated, washed, and tested for transport activity in the presence of fresh cytosol (Fig. 5 B). Addition of fresh cytosol to the control membranes recovered most of their transport activity, whereas W7-treated membranes could restore up to 90% of transport only when purified CaM was added together with the fresh cytosol. Hence, CaM appears to be involved in intra-Golgi transport. These results also indicate that the low levels of CaM in the cytosol are insufficient to reactivate the Golgi membranes after treatment with W7. CaM-dependent transport was strongly inhibited by BAPTA (Fig. 5 B) indicating that Ca2+ is required for the CaM activation of transport. It has been well demonstrated that Ca2+ regulates vesicular transport between a number of different intracellular organelles, but its involvement in intra-Golgi transport remains poorly understood. Here, we have investigated the role Ca2+ plays in this process by using the well established intra-Golgi transport assay. We found that low cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations (approximately 100 nm) are optimal for intra-Golgi transport whereas higher Ca2+ concentrations inhibit this process. Moreover, it appears that Ca2+ efflux from intracellular stores (possibly from the Golgi complex itself) is essential for intra-Golgi transport. Our results indicated that Ca2+ played a role in late stages of transport, possibly in the fusion of vesicles with their target membrane. Finally we demonstrate that CaM is involved in intra-Golgi transport. Several studies have documented that Ca2+ plays an important role in regulated exocytosis of secretory granules and synaptic vesicles (reviewed in Refs. 23Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar and 24Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 893-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). More recently it was reported that Ca2+ participates in other intracellular transport events, including ER to Golgi transport (25Beckers C.J. Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18298-18310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), assembly of nuclear membrane (10Sullivan K.M. Busa W.B. Wilson K.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1411-1422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), transcytotic vesicle fusion (26Barroso M.R. Bernd K.K. DeWitt N.D. Chang A. Mills K. Sztul E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10183-10187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), vacuolar membrane fusion (11Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and fusion between endosomes (12Colombo M.I. Beron W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7707-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Holroyd C. Kistner U. Annaert W. Jahn R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3035-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The requirement for Ca2+ in intra-Golgi transport has remained unclear, however, because early reports using a cell-free intra-Golgi transport assay demonstrated no effect of EGTA (14Fries E. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), whereas in semi-intact cells, EGTA was able to inhibit this transport process (9Schwaninger R. Beckers C.J. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13055-13063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with the early reports, we now show that intra-Golgi transport is indeed resistant to EGTA. However, this transport step is highly sensitive to the fast acting Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA. This phenomenon of sensitivity to BAPTA but resistance to EGTA has been observed for other systems of membrane fusion, including homotypic vacuolar fusion (11Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and endosomal fusion (13Holroyd C. Kistner U. Annaert W. Jahn R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3035-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This suggests that transient, probably local, changes in Ca2+concentration mediate the fusion process. Indeed, our results (Fig. 3) are consistent with the notion that intra-Golgi transport depends upon Ca2+ efflux from inner membrane stores. Several studies have indicated that the Golgi complex may function as a Ca2+ storage organelle (8Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 27Lin P. Le-Niculescu H. Hofmeister R. McCaffery J.M. Jin M. Hennemann H. McQuistan T. De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. J.

A. 2000; 97: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus it is feasible that Ca2+ from the lumen of the Golgi directly participated in regulating intra-Golgi transport. In most cells the free Ca2+ concentration rests at approximately 100 nm, and following activation of cellular signaling pathways Ca2+ levels are elevated about 1000-fold (30Augustine G.J. Charlton M.P. Smith S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1987; 10: 633-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Llinas R. Sugimori M. Silver R.B. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1443-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have found that intra-Golgi transport is optimal in the presence of about 100 nm free Ca2+, but that higher Ca2+ concentrations strongly inhibit transport. This may imply that constitutive membrane transport is optimal when the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration remain at resting levels, but is inhibited upon elevation of cytosolic Ca2+. Because exocytosis depends critically on high Ca2+ levels, this may provide a mechanism for the cell to conserve the fusion machinery for the transient and more immediate requirement of exocytosis at the expense of constitutive transport. What are the downstream targets of Ca2+ in this system? It has recently been demonstrated that the Ca2+-binding protein CaM plays an important role in fusion between yeast vacuoles (11Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It was postulated that CaM acts in this system at a late step of the fusion reaction, probably after docking of the transport vesicle with its target membrane (11Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). CaM antagonists were found to inhibit endosome fusion in vitro (12Colombo M.I. Beron W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7707-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The strong inhibition of intra-Golgi transport by the CaM antagonist reported here suggests that CaM may regulate various intracellular fusion processes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Recently Mayer and co-workers (32Peters C. Andrews P.D. Stark M.J. Cesaro-Tadic S. Glatz A. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Mayer A. Science. 1999; 285: 1084-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) suggested that protein phosphatase 1 may be involved in late stages of vacuolar fusion, possibly in a CaM-dependent manner. Future studies will determine whether protein phosphatase 1 or another target represents the effector of Ca2+ in constitutive membrane transport and how this effector acts on the transport machinery.

We used the human calcitonin gene (CALC-I) promoter to generate transgenic mice expressing either the human RET oncogene with the MEN2B-specific 918 Met-->Thr mutation (CALC-MEN2B-RET) or the human non-mutated RET proto-oncogene (CALC-WT-RET) in the C-cells. At 20 - 22 months of age three out of eight CALC-MEN2B-RET transgenic founders presented with macroscopic bilateral MTC. In two founders nodular C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) was observed. Thyroid abnormalities were never observed in CALC-WT-RET transgenic mice or control non-transgenic mice analysed at this age. In some mice from established CALC-MEN2B-RET transgenic lines nodular CCH was observed from 8 months on whereas MTC was detected in 13% of mice from one CALC-MEN2B-RET line, from the age of 11 months on. These results show for the first time that the MEN2B mutation in the RET oncogene predisposes mice for MTC."

https://openalex.org/W1988077232,"The potent osteoclastogenic agent, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), exerts its biological effects via two receptors, namely TNF receptors 1 (p55r) and 2 (p75r), each present on osteoclast precursors. Thus, we asked if p55r and p75r differentially impact the osteoclastogenic process. Marrow derived from mice expressing only p55r generates substantially more osteoclasts, in the basal state, than does wild type, while marrow expressing only p75r, produces substantially fewer. Reflecting its preferential activation of p55r, exogenous TNF stimulates osteoclast formation by p55r(+/+)p75r(-/-), but not p55r(-/-)p75r(+/+), marrow. Consistent with the fact that NF-kappaB is essential for osteoclastogenesis, this transcription complex is activated, relative to wild type, in p55r(+/+)p75r(-/-) osteoclast precursors and suppressed in those expressing only p75r. Because p55r enhances, and p75r suppresses, osteoclastogenesis, we asked if their principal ligands, namely soluble and membrane-residing TNF, respectively, differentially impact basal osteoclast recruitment. We find, in contrast to the significant level of osteoclast formation in wild type marrow, osteoclastogenesis by that derived from mice expressing membrane, but not soluble, TNF, is negligible. Thus, optimal therapeutic inhibition of bone resorption may entail selective TNF receptor modulation and/or arrested cleavage of membrane TNF to its soluble form."

Frabin has one actin filament-binding (FAB) domain, one Dbl homology (DH) domain, first pleckstrin homology (PH) domain adjacent to the DH domain, one cysteine-rich FYVE domain, and second PH domain from the N-terminus to the C-terminus in this order. Different domains of frabin are involved in the microspike formation and the JNK activation, and the association of frabin with the actin cytoskeleton through the FAB domain is necessary for the microspike formation, but not for the JNK activation. We have found here that frabin induces the formation of not only filopodium-like microspikes but also lamellipodium-like structures in NIH3T3 and L fibroblasts. We have analysed the mechanism of frabin in these two actions and found that frabin induces filopodium-like microspike formation through the direct activation of Cdc42 and lamellipodium-like structure formation through the Cdc42-independent indirect activation of Rac small G protein. The FAB domain of frabin in addition to the DH domain and the first PH domain is necessary for the filopodium-like microspike formation, but not for the lamellipodium-like structure formation. The FYVE domain and the second PH domain in addition to the DH domain and the first PH domain are necessary for the lamellipodium-like structure formation. We show here these two actions of frabin in the regulation of cell morphology."

Addition of erythrocytes with increasing intracellular ascorbate concentrations decreased the oxidation of ascorbate in a concentration-dependent manner. Concurrently, it was found, utilizing electron spin resonance spectroscopy, that extracellular ascorbate radical levels were decreased. Control experiments showed that these results could not be explained by leakage of ascorbate from the cells, inactivation of ascorbate oxidase, or oxygen depletion. Thus, this means that intracellular ascorbate is directly responsible for the decreased oxidation of extracellular ascorbate. Exposure of ascorbate-loaded erythrocytes to higher levels of extracellular ascorbate radicals resulted in the detection of intracellular ascorbate radicals. Moreover, efflux of dehydroascorbic acid was observed under these conditions. These data confirm the view that intracellular ascorbate donates electrons to extracellular ascorbate free radical via a plasma membrane redox system.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 2Rose R.C. Bode A.M. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The importance of sufficient levels of ascorbate has been well established in the past (3Padh H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 4Gershoff S.N. Nutr. Rev. 1993; 51: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Primates and guinea pigs lack the ability to synthesize ascorbate from glucose and are dependent on dietary intake. Ascorbate deficiency may lead to scurvy and to oxidative injury resulting in necrosis or apoptosis. It may also cause malignant proliferation of cells as a consequence of oxidative DNA damage (5Block G. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 54: 1310s-1314sCrossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The oxidation of ascorbate is a two-step reaction in which single electrons are transferred. The first step yields a relatively stable radical, the ascorbate free radical (AFR).1 In the second step, AFR donates a second electron, yielding dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). These steps are reversible, but DHA can irreversibly be hydrolyzed to diketo-gulonic acid, which degrades further to potentially toxic compounds (6Bianchi J. Rose R.C. Toxicology. 1986; 40: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Pence L.A. Mennear J.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1979; 50: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 8Rose R.C. Choi J.L. Bode A.M. Life Sci. 1992; 50: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The degradation of DHA is very fast, with a half-life of approximately 8 min at 37 °C (9Van Duijn M.M.

Chem. 1990; 36: 1807-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Under oxidative stress, the consumption of ascorbate can be high, and without regeneration, ascorbate would soon be depleted. However, in order to restore ascorbate levels, systems exist that reduce AFR and/or DHA. Most of these systems are located in the cell. Reactions proceed spontaneously, such as glutathione-mediated ascorbate regeneration (11May J.M. Qu Z.C. Whitesell R.R. Cobb C.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), or are mediated by enzymes, such as thioredoxin reductase (12May J.M. Mendiratta S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol.

Moreover, an NADH:AFR reductase has been described that reduces intracellular AFR (17Diliberto Jr., E.J. Dean G. Carter C. Allen P.L. J. Neurochem. 1982; 39: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These pathways only convert oxidized ascorbate species that are present in the cell. Regeneration of extracellular ascorbate is more complicated. Reduction of extracellular DHA can involve transport of DHA into the cell, e.g. by the GLUT-1 glucose transporter (9Van Duijn M.M.

Biomembr. 1994; 26: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This regeneration pathway, however, cannot prevent depletion of extracellular ascorbate. Ascorbate is trapped inside the cell after reduction and will only slowly leak back to the extracellular space. It is, therefore, essential that other regenerating pathways exist. Recently, Himmelreich et al. (21Himmelreich U. Drew K.N. Serianni A.S. Kuchel P.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7578-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) reported that in erythrocytes, extracellular DHA can be reduced without entering the cell. Also, transmembrane AFR reductases have been described in the plasma membrane of liver cells (22Villalba J.M. Canalejo A. Rodriguez-Aguilera J.C. Buron M.I. Morre D.J. Navas P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and red blood cells (23May J.M. Qu Z.C. Cobb C.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

It was suggested that the latter reduce extracellular ascorbate radicals using intracellular NADH, thereby generating ascorbate and NAD+. Previous observations indicated that alternative systems might exist in the plasma membranes of cells. It was found that intracellular ascorbate acted as electron donor for transmembrane electron transport, with ferricyanide as extracellular electron acceptor (9Van Duijn M.M. Van der Zee J. VanSteveninck J. Van den Broek P.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13415-13420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25May J.M. Qu Z.C. Whitesell R.R. Biochim. Biophys.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 995-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, the actual substrate is still unknown, as ferricyanide is not a physiological compound. Because ascorbate is a natural compound in, for example, blood plasma, we hypothesized that under physiological conditions, AFR and/or DHA might act as the extracellular electron acceptor. Therefore, we investigated this hypothesis using erythrocytes as a model system. The data in this paper provide the first experimental evidence for the presence of a system in the erythrocyte membrane that reduces ascorbate free radicals in the extracellular space using intracellular ascorbate as an electron donor. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Baker, unless indicated otherwise. l-Ascorbate oxidase (EC 1.10.3.3) was purchased as sticks containing 17 units of enzyme (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, The Netherlands) and was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Tris(ethylenediamine)-nickel(II) chloride 2-hydrate (Ni(en)32+) was synthesized according to State (28State H.M. Inorg. Synth. 1960; 6: 200-201Google Scholar). Erythrocytes were obtained from 1-day-old citrate-anticoagulated blood collected from healthy human volunteers by the Bloodbank Leiden/Haaglanden. The cells were washed three times with PBS. The buffy coat of white cells was removed carefully with each wash. Erythrocytes were loaded with ascorbate by resuspension of the cells to a hematocrit of 20% in PBS containing 2.5 mm adenosine as energy source (29May J.M. Qu Z.C. Whitesell R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12721-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and DHA at concentrations as indicated under “Results.” Control erythrocytes were treated similarly but without DHA present. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, erythrocytes were washed three times with PBS and used within 1 h for subsequent experiments. All experiments were performed in PBS at room temperature. Ascorbate concentrations in erythrocytes were determined by HPLC. Loaded, packed erythrocytes were mixed with 3 volumes of 7 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 4.0, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, hemoglobin was removed using an Amicon micropartition system with 30-kDa cutoff ultrafiltration membranes (Millipore, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands). 100 μl of 0.5 mm EDTA, 450 μl of methanol, and 5 μl of concentrated HCl were added to 200 μl of ultrafiltrate, and 100 μl of this mixture was injected on an Adsorbosphere SAX column (250 × 4.6 mm, Alltech, Breda, The Netherlands). Ascorbate was eluted with 7 mm potassium phosphate, 7 mm KCl, pH 4.0, at a rate of 1.5 ml/min. The LKB 2140 detector (LKB, Bromma, Sweden) was set at 265 nm, and chromatograms were integrated on a personal computer, using Nelson 2600 revised 4.1 software (Nelson Analytical, Cupertina, CA). After the elution of ascorbate, the column was regenerated with 0.25 m potassium phosphate and 0.5 m KCl, pH 5.0. Ascorbate concentrations are expressed relative to the water content of packed erythrocytes, which is 70% of the packed cell volume (26Orringer E.P. Roer M.E.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Ascorbate concentrations were determined by measuring the absorption at 265 nm in a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer (extinction coefficient, 14.500 m−1cm−1) or by HPLC analysis. For HPLC analysis, 200 μl of the solution was diluted with 100 μl of 0.5 mm EDTA, 450 μl of methanol, and 5 μl of concentrated HCl and subsequently injected and analyzed as described above. When present, erythrocytes were removed by centrifugation prior to the determination of ascorbate. Ascorbate depletion from erythrocytes was carried out by treating cells with 1 mm 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPOL) as described by May et al. (30May J.M. Qu Z.C. Mendiratta S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and Mehlhorn (31Mehlhorn R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2724-2731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20% erythrocytes were incubated in PBS with 1 mm TEMPOL for 5 min at 37 °C. After subsequent centrifugation, this treatment was repeated twice, followed by three washes with PBS alone. NADH levels in erythrocytes were modulated by incubation of 10% erythrocytes with 10 mm pyruvate, xylitol, or glucose at 37 °C for 45 min. After centrifugation, samples were taken for the NAD/NADH assay. The remaining erythrocytes were resuspended in their respective buffers, including pyruvate, glucose, or xylitol, and immediately used for an ascorbate oxidation assay. NAD and NADH levels were determined using an alcohol dehydrogenase cycling assay modified from Wagner and Scott (32Wagner T.C. Scott M.D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl of packed erythrocytes were diluted in 1.3 ml of extraction buffer, frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed, and filtered using an Amicon micropartition system with 30-kDa cutoff ultrafiltration membranes. The filtrate was further analyzed as described by Wagner and Scott (32Wagner T.C. Scott M.D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ESR spectra were recorded on a JEOL-RE2X spectrometer operating at 9.36 GHz with a 100 kHz modulation frequency and equipped with a TM110 cavity. Samples were transferred to a quartz flat cell using a rapid sampling device, which allowed the recording of spectra to be started within seconds after mixing. ESR spectrometer settings were as follows: microwave power, 40 mW; modulation amplitude, 1 G; time constant, 0.3 s; scan time, 5 min; scan width, 15 G. Loading of erythrocytes withl-[carboxyl-14C]ascorbate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out by incubating a 20% suspension with 500 μm14C-labeled ascorbate and 1.7 units/ml ascorbate oxidase. After 30 min, the erythrocytes were washed three times with PBS and resuspended at 10% hematocrit. After the experiment, the suspensions were centrifuged, and the supernatants were transferred to vials for liquid scintillation counting and for immediate HPLC analysis, as described above. Fractions were collected and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. The scintillation mixtures used were Emulsifier Scintillator 299 and Flo-Scint IV (Packard). 14C-Labeled DHA was prepared by incubation of [14C]ascorbate with bromine, according to Washkoet al. (33Washko P.W. Wang Y. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15531-15535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with every step on ice. Immediately after preparation, 1 mm14C-labeled DHA was added to either PBS or to a 10% suspension of ascorbate-loaded or control erythrocytes. After incubation, supernatants were collected, separated by HPLC, and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Oxygen consumption was measured using a YSI 5300 biological oxygen monitor (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). All experiments were performed at least three times and were evaluated using Student's t test where applicable. Ascorbate can easily be oxidized in aqueous solution by spontaneous, metal-ion, or enzyme-catalyzed reactions. In this study, the enzyme ascorbate oxidase was used to oxidize ascorbate. Incubation of ascorbate with ascorbate oxidase resulted in a decrease of the ascorbate concentration that was linear for 15 min (Fig. 1). After 60 min, approximately 60% of the ascorbate was oxidized. Ascorbate oxidation decreased upon addition of erythrocytes, and decreased even further by addition of erythrocytes, loaded with ascorbate. The addition of cells with high levels of intracellular ascorbate resulted in complete protection (Fig. 1). This suggested that intracellular ascorbate played an important role in the effect of erythrocytes on the oxidation of ascorbate. To test this, ascorbate-loaded cells were treated with TEMPOL, which depleted intracellular ascorbate by more than 90% (data not shown). As expected, the effect of ascorbate-loaded cells on ascorbate oxidation could be reversed by treatment with TEMPOL (Fig.1). In subsequent experiments, erythrocytes were preincubated with various concentrations of DHA to determine the correlation between the intracellular ascorbate concentration and extracellular ascorbate oxidation. Fig. 2 shows that the rate of ascorbate oxidation in the external medium was strongly dependent on the intracellular ascorbate concentration: with increasing intracellular ascorbate concentrations, the oxidation of extracellular ascorbate decreased.Figure 2Correlation between the intracellular ascorbate concentration and the oxidation rate of extracellular ascorbate. Erythrocytes were loaded with ascorbate by treating cells with various concentrations of DHA, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Subsequently, a 10% suspension was incubated with 100 μm ascorbate and 4 milliunits/ml ascorbate oxidase. After 0 and 15 min, the amount of ascorbate in the supernatant was determined by measuring A 265 and by HPLC, and the rate of ascorbate oxidation was calculated. Results ofA 265 measurements are presented as the average of three experiments ± S.E. Measurements using the HPLC method are not shown, but they produced similar data. The intracellular ascorbate concentration was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inset, intracellular ascorbate concentration resulting from preincubation with various concentrations of DHA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 1 shows that addition of control erythrocytes (i.e. not loaded with ascorbate) decreased ascorbate oxidation by 30–40%. To test whether NADH contributed to this effect, erythrocytes were incubated with various compounds that are known to perturb the NADH/NAD+ ratio (34Alvarez J. Camaleno J.M. Garcia-Sancho J. Herreros B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 856: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 35Momsen G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 210: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A decrease in the intracellular NADH concentration resulted in an increase in the ascorbate oxidation rate, whereas an increase in NADH resulted in a concomitant decrease in the ascorbate oxidation rate (Table I). This shows that NADH, as well as ascorbate, plays a role in the regeneration of extracellular ascorbate. To measure the relative contribution of endogenous ascorbate to the effect of control erythrocytes on ascorbate oxidation, cells were treated with TEMPOL. However, it was found that TEMPOL also reduced intracellular NADH levels (Table I). It was, therefore, not possible to separate the effects of endogenous ascorbate and NADH. It should be noted that TEMPOL depleted NADH only in the case of control erythrocytes, and not in erythrocytes loaded with ascorbate.Table IEffect of energy sources and TEMPOL on NADH levels and the ascorbate oxidation rateAdditionsAscorbate oxidation rateNADHμm/min% reduced nucleotideNone1.30 ± 0.0526 ± 7Adenosine1.06 ± 0.0978 ± 5Glucose1.08 ± 0.1052 ± 9Xylitol1.14 ± 0.0758 ± 9Pyruvate1.39 ± 0.0419 ± 5TEMPOL1.39 ± 0.0614 ± 5Erythrocytes that had not been loaded with ascorbate were preincubated with the additions listed.

All results are shown as an average ± S.E. The effect of erythrocytes on ascorbate oxidation could be explained by inhibition of ascorbate oxidase by the erythrocytes. To study this hypothesis, control or ascorbate-loaded erythrocytes were incubated with ascorbate oxidase for 0 or 15 min. After removal of the erythrocytes, 100 μm ascorbate was added to the supernatants, and the rate of ascorbate oxidation was determined. It was found that incubation of ascorbate oxidase with control or ascorbate-loaded erythrocytes did not affect the activity of the enzyme. Oxygen is also required for ascorbate oxidase activity. Under our experimental conditions, oxygen levels did not decrease more than 20%, which showed that oxygen levels were not limiting during the experiments (data not shown). A possible explanation for the protection by ascorbate-loaded erythrocytes could be leakage of ascorbate from the erythrocytes. More than 1 mm ascorbate was accumulated intracellularly after incubation with DHA (Fig. 2, inset). Leakage of the accumulated ascorbate could result in an extracellular ascorbate concentration of up to 100 μm. To investigate leakage of intracellular ascorbate, erythrocytes were loaded with14C-labeled ascorbate. TableII shows that incubation of these erythrocytes caused some leakage of 14C-labeled material, both in control cells and after addition of ascorbate, DHA, or ascorbate oxidase. The addition of 100 μm ascorbate and 4 milliunits of ascorbate oxidase/ml resulted in a small increase in leakage of radioactivity. This amounted to an extracellular concentration of 3 μm14C-labeled material. From the data in Fig. 2, it can be deduced that complete protection against oxidation of ascorbate would need leakage of 20 μm ascorbate. This means that efflux of ascorbate could maximally account for 15% of the observed effect. Only in the presence of a higher ascorbate oxidase concentration did leakage become substantial. Furthermore, HPLC analysis revealed that most of the radioactivity was released from the cells as [14C]DHA, and not as [14C]ascorbate (Fig.3). Leakage of DHA could be inhibited by the addition of cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of the GLUT-1 transporter (Table II). Thus, it can be concluded that leakage of ascorbate is not responsible for the decrease in ascorbate oxidation.Table IILeakage of radioactivity from erythrocytes containing [ 14 C]ascorbateExtracellular additionsLeakage% of total contentNone1.1 ± 0.3100 μm ascorbate1.3 ± 0.1100 μmDHA1.5 ± 0.14 milliunits/ml ascorbate oxidase1.2 ± 0.214 milliunits/ml ascorbate oxidase0.8 ± 0.1100 μm ascorbate, 4 milliunits/ml ascorbate oxidase3.0 ± 0.52-ap < 0.01 compared to control using Student's t test.100 μmascorbate, 14 milliunits/ml ascorbate oxidase12.4 ± 1.22-ap < 0.01 compared to control using Student's t test.100 μmascorbate, 4 milliunits/ml ascorbate oxidase, 20 μmcytochalasin B1.8 ± 0.3100 μm ascorbate, 14 milliunits/ml ascorbate oxidase, 20 μm cytochalasin B4.2 ± 0.42-ap < 0.01 compared to control using Student's t test.Erythrocytes were loaded with 14C-labeled ascorbate, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” washed, and incubated as a 10% suspension with the additions indicated in the table.

The oxidation of ascorbate by ascorbate oxidase results in the formation of ascorbate free radical, which can easily be detected by ESR spectroscopy. The ESR spectrum consists of a doublet with hyperfine splitting, a H4 = 1.8 G (Fig. 4 A). Control experiments showed that AFR peak intensities were constant for at least 15 min. The data in Fig. 4 were obtained with a scan time of 5 min and therefore represent steady state levels of AFR. No signal was observed when ascorbate was omitted from the incubation mixture (data not shown). Removal of ascorbate oxidase resulted in a small AFR signal, which amounted to 15% of the signal in Fig. 4 A (data not shown). This signal was due to autoxidation and transition metal-mediated oxidation of ascorbate (36Van Duijn M.M. Van der Zee J. Van den Broek P.J.A. Protoplasma. 1998; 205: 122-128Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Addition of erythrocytes decreased AFR signal intensity by 10%, whereas the addition of ascorbate-loaded erythrocytes decreased the AFR concentration considerably (compare Fig. 4, A, C, and E). In the presence of ascorbate-loaded erythrocytes, AFR could be generated both inside and outside the cell. To distinguish between intra- and extracellular AFR, the line broadening compound Ni(en)32+ was used. This compound induces line broadening of the AFR signal, as is illustrated in Fig.4 B, without influencing its redox properties (37Wakefield L.M. Cass A.E. Radda G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9746-9752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Ni(en)32+ cannot cross the plasma membrane, only the intensity of the extracellular AFR signal will be affected. Addition of 5 mmNi(en)32+ to an incubation of control or ascorbate-loaded erythrocytes in the presence of ascorbate and ascorbate oxidase resulted in the line broadening of the AFR signal (Fig. 4, D and F). This shows that the AFR signal detected under these experimental conditions came from ascorbate located outside the cell. To determine the correlation between the intracellular ascorbate concentration and extracellular AFR, cells were preincubated with various DHA concentrations. Fig. 5 shows the effect of increasing intracellular ascorbate concentrations on external AFR signal intensities. Ascorbate-loaded erythrocytes reduced the AFR signal in the extracellular medium in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect was similar to the effect observed in Fig. 2. So far, our data seem to indicate that extracellular AFR is reduced by intracellular ascorbate. If the hypothesis is correct that intracellular ascorbate donates an electron to extracellular AFR, it can be expected that intracellular AFR is generated as a consequence of this reaction. The data in Fig. 4suggest that under the present conditions, only extracellular AFR can be observed. The absence of an intracellular AFR signal is most likely due to the efficient regeneration of ascorbate in the erythrocyte. To overwhelm the reductive capacity of the cell, extracellular AFR levels were increased using high concentrations of ascorbate and ascorbate oxidase. Incubation of 1 mmascorbate with 20 milliunits/ml ascorbate oxidase in the presence of 5 mm Ni(en)32+ resulted in a broadened AFR signal (Fig.6 A). Subsequently, erythrocytes were added (20% suspension), and the spectrum in Fig.6 B was obtained, which is identical to the spectrum obtained without erythrocytes. When ascorbate-loaded erythrocytes were used, on the other hand, the ESR spectrum showed additional, slightly sharper peaks (Fig. 6 C). This indicates that an additional AFR signal was formed that could not be broadened by Ni(en)32+. Subtraction of curve A (Fig.6) from curve C generated the spectrum given in Fig. 6 D,which is typical for AFR in the absence of Ni(en)32+ (simulated in Fig.6 E). This shows that at high levels of extracellular AFR, intracellular AFR can indeed be detected. Although the ESR experiments indicated that extracellular AFR was reduced by the erythrocytes, we also investigated whether reduction of extracellular DHA played a role. [14C]DHA was added either to PBS or to a 10% suspension of ascorbate-loaded or control erythrocytes. After 10 min, the supernatants were collected and injected on a HPLC system. A small peak at the retention time of ascorbate was found to develop during the incubation of DHA alone (Fig. 7). The presence of erythrocytes resulted in a slightly larger peak, but no differences were found between ascorbate-loaded and control erythrocytes. Addition of erythrocytes with increasing intracellular ascorbate concentrations decreased the oxidation rate of extracellular ascorbate by ascorbate oxidase (Fig. 1). At intracellular concentrations of 1 mm, ascorbate degradation was even completely prevented (Fig. 2). Removal of intracellular ascorbate by TEMPOL reversed the process (Fig. 1). In control experiments, inactivation of ascorbate oxidase and leakage of intracellular ascorbate could be eliminated as explanations for these findings. Thus, intracellular ascorbate directly influences the oxidation rate of extracellular ascorbate, even in the physiological range of 20–60 μm ascorbate (Fig. 2) (38Evans R.M. Currie L. Campbell A. Br. J. Nutr. 1982; 47: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Addition of control erythrocytes, i.e. erythrocytes with only endogenous ascorbate, decreased the ascorbate oxidation by 30–40%. NADH also contributed to this effect, as the ascorbate oxidation rate was readily affected by changes in the concentration of NADH in the erythrocytes (Table I). Unfortunately, the relative contribution of endogenous ascorbate and NADH could not be established experimentally, as depletion of endogenous ascorbate by TEMPOL also caused depletion of NADH (Table I). Nevertheless, it can be concluded that the degradation of extracellular ascorbate is prevented by reactions that are driven by intracellular NADH and ascorbate. In erythrocytes loaded with ascorbate, the ascorbate-driven reaction prevails. Ascorbate oxidase produces AFR from ascorbate in a direct reaction, followed by disproportionation of two AFR molecules to one molecule of ascorbate and one molecule of DHA (39Yamazaki I. Piette L.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 50: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In order to restore ascorbate levels, either AFR or DHA has to be reduced to ascorbate. There have been reports on the reduction of extracellular DHA by K-562 cells (40Schweinzer E. Mao Y. Krajnik P. Getoff N. Goldenberg H. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1996; 14: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and by erythrocytes (21Himmelreich U. Drew K.N. Serianni A.S. Kuchel P.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7578-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but our data did not indicate an important role for this process. A small amount of ascorbate or an ascorbate-like compound was formed on incubation of DHA in PBS (Fig. 7). Jung and Wells (41Jung C.H. Wells W.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) described a degradation product of DHA that can reduce DHA to ascorbate. In addition, degradation of DHA results in erythroascorbic acid, an analogue of ascorbate that could elute very similar in our HPLC system. These processes could contribute to the formation of the ascorbate-like peak at 5.5 min. The peak increased slightly in the presence of erythrocytes, irrespective of the presence of intracellular ascorbate. This small increase may be caused by a NADH-dependent redox system. Thus, although our data indicate that erythrocytes reduce some extracellular DHA, it is evident that this does not depend on the intracellular ascorbate concentration. Reduction of ascorbate radical levels could be established using ESR spectroscopy (Figs. 4 and 5). A correlation was found between increasing intracellular ascorbate concentrations and the decrease in extracellular ascorbate oxidation, reflected either by the absorbance of ascorbate in the extracellular medium or by steady state levels of AFR (Figs. 2 and 5). This suggests that there is a close relationship between the intracellular ascorbate concentration and the reduction of extracellular oxidation products. A plausible explanation is that intracellular ascorbate supplies an electron that reduces extracellular AFR to extracellular ascorbate. In this process, intracellular ascorbate will be oxidized to an ascorbate radical. Either this radical can be reduced to ascorbate via intracellular NADH-AFR reductases or two radicals can disproportionate to ascorbate and DHA. At first, we were unable to detect intracellular AFR. This can be explained by the fact that with low levels of extracellular AFR, the cell is able to regenerate intracellular ascorbate efficiently, and intracellular levels of AFR will be too low to be detected. Higher levels of AFR will cause a more severe oxidative stress over the plasma membrane, and intracellular regeneration of ascorbate might be overwhelmed. This was indeed the case. Using Ni(en)32+ to line broaden extracellular AFR signals, a small intracellular AFR signal could be detected (Fig.6). This strongly suggests that intracellular ascorbate donates an electron to extracellular AFR, forming extracellular ascorbate and intracellular AFR. The efflux of 14C-labeled material from the erythrocytes provided additional evidence (Fig. 3 and Table II). HPLC analysis of the extracellular medium revealed that 14C-labeled material emerged as [14C]DHA, rather than [14C]ascorbate (Fig. 3). The efflux of14C-labeled material was increased in the presence of ascorbate and ascorbate oxidase. This confirmed that external AFR induced an oxidative stress over the membrane, which resulted in the oxidation of intracellular ascorbate. At high levels of AFR, the production of DHA exceeds the capacity of the cell for regeneration to ascorbate, resulting in efflux of DHA via the GLUT-1 transporter (TableII). Although there is good evidence for ascorbate-dependent electron transport across the membrane, it is still not clear what the functional components of this system are. Possible mechanisms are transport chains of a physicochemical nature, e.g. an α-tocopherol electron shuttle, and protein-mediated systems such as an integral plasma membrane protein, complexes of multiple proteins, or proteins using a co-factor to traverse the membrane. However, the standard reduction potentials (Eo′) of α-tocopherol and ascorbate with their respective radicals differ by more than 200 mV, which makes the transfer of an electron from α-tocopherol to AFR unlikely (1Buettner G.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Another putative co-factor is coenzyme Q, but its capability to move freely across the lipid bilayer has been questioned (27May J.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 995-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 42Ulrich E.L. Girvin M.E. Cramer W.A. Markley J.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2501-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, capsaicin and dicumarol, inhibitors of coenzyme Q-mediated electron transport, did not inhibit the decrease in the level of AFR in the presence of ascorbate-loaded erythrocytes (data not shown). The most likely form appears to be a single protein or a protein complex, accepting electrons from intracellular ascorbate and transporting them to extracellular AFR. Interestingly, a cytochrome with a similar function has been described in chromaffin cells from the adrenal medulla. In chromaffin vesicles inside these cells, norepinephrine is synthesized at the expense of large amounts of ascorbate. A cytochrome b 561 is present in the vesicle membrane, transporting electrons from cytoplasmic ascorbate to intravesicular AFR (43Srivastava M. Duong L.T. Fleming P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8072-8075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Wakefield L.M. Cass A.E. Radda G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9739-9745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar or identical cytochrome could explain the ascorbate:AFR oxidoreductase activity in the erythrocyte. Indeed, evidence was found for the presence of a b cytochrome in the erythrocyte membrane with spectral characteristics similar to those of cytochromeb 561. 2M. M. VanDuijn, J. T. Buijs, J. Van der Zee, and P. J. A. Van den Broek, submitted for publication. However, it has been reported that cytochromeb 561 is not present in the erythrocyte (45Pruss R.M. Shepard E.A. Neuroscience. 1987; 22: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in recent work by our group.2 It is conceivable that a cytochrome similar to cytochromeb 561 is responsible for the reduction of AFR by the erythrocyte, but so far, no proteins with structural homology to cytochrome b 561 have been described. The various processes in the erythrocyte are summarized in Fig.8. Extracellular AFR is reduced by intracellular ascorbate via an ascorbate:AFR reductase (1). Concurrently, intracellular ascorbate is oxidized to AFR, which can be reduced to ascorbate via intracellular NADH-AFR reductases or disproportionate to ascorbate and DHA. Efflux of DHA proceeds through the GLUT-1 transporter (3), which facilitates bidirectional transport of DHA over the plasma membrane. In addition, extracellular AFR can be reduced by a NADH-dependent AFR reductase (2). Presently, it is not known whether the ascorbate-dependent AFR reductase discussed in this paper is related in any way to other AFR reductases known from the literature. Generation of intracellular AFR, as well as efflux of DHA, was found by May et al. (11May J.M. Qu Z.C. Whitesell R.R. Cobb C.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 29May J.M. Qu Z.C. Whitesell R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12721-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) upon incubation of erythrocytes with ferricyanide. However, recently May and Qu (46May J.M. Qu Z.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1421: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) observed that pCMBS partly inhibited ascorbate-dependent ferricyanide reduction in erythrocytes, whereas it did not influence ferric iron reduction. We were unable to find any effect of pCMBS on the AFR reductive capacity (data not shown). This suggests that AFR and ferricyanide are not reduced by the same reductase, but it could imply that the erythrocyte AFR reductase also catalyzes ferric iron reduction. Further studies are, however, required to identify the transmembrane reductase or reductases that are responsible for the ascorbate-dependent reduction of extracellular oxidants."
https://openalex.org/W2101936797,"The efficacy of anticancer therapy is limited by the development of drug resistance. While the role of p53 in the intrinsic sensitivity of human cancer cells to paclitaxel (PTX) remains controversial, its role in acquired paclitaxel resistance has never been addressed. In this study we examined the p53 status of three paclitaxel selected human ovarian carcinoma sublines, resistant to paclitaxel due to acquired beta-tubulin mutations which impair paclitaxel's interaction with tubulin. In contrast to parental cells which have wt p53, in all PTX-resistant sublines p53 was functionally inactive. Two of the resistant sublines expressed high levels of transcriptionally inactive p53 protein, each with a distinct point mutation in codons 236 and 239 of the DNA binding domain. The third subline presented a novel p53 pseudo-null phenotype as a result of markedly decreased wt p53 mRNA expression. Introduction of ectopic wt p53 had no effect on PTX sensitivity in both parental and resistant cells, while it induced p21WAF1/CIP1, demonstrating an intact p53 pathway. While PTX resistance is primarily conferred by the tubulin mutations, the loss of functional p53 observed in all clones, suggests that this loss may facilitate the development of resistance potentially by providing a clonal advantage which promotes the isolation of paclitaxel resistant cells."

https://openalex.org/W1518473490,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two genes (GRS1 and GRS2) encode glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS1 and GlyRS2, respectively). 59% of the sequence of GlyRS2 is identical to that of GlyRS1. Others have proposed that GRS1 and GRS2 encode the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes, respectively. In this work, we show that GRS1 encodes both functions, whereasGRS2 is dispensable. In addition, both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial phenotypes of the knockout allele of GRS1 inS. cerevisiae are complemented by the expression of the only known gene for glycyl-tRNA synthetase in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Thus, a single gene for glycyl-tRNA synthetase likely encodes both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial activities in most or all yeast. Phylogenetic analysis shows that GlyRS2 is a predecessor of all yeast GlyRS homologues. Thus, GRS1 appears to be the result of a duplication of GRS2, which itself is pseudogene-like."

This highly regulated form of programmed death of a eukaryotic cell can either be induced by neighboring cells via receptor-mediated activation of an apoptotic cascade or by the cell itself, e.g. when irreversible DNA damage has been detected by cell cycle checkpoint control (reviewed in Refs. 1Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar and 2Nagata S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Both forms of cell death share most of the signaling cascade mediated by caspases, and both forms finally result in a characteristic chromatin condensation and later in the degradation of the cell into apoptotic bodies, subcellular particles that can be removed by neighboring cells. The signaling molecules that play major roles in the amplification and execution of cell death have been thoroughly investigated through the last years, and even first clinical attempts to manipulate these signaling cascades either to enhance or to reduce death in certain types of diseases have been made (3Schmitt C.A. Lowe S.W.J. Pathology. 1999; 187: 127-137Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 4Bamford M. Walkinshaw G. Brown B. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, several aspects of the molecular mechanisms of programmed cell death are still enigmatic. Open questions concern the role as well as the putative rules of DNA cleavage within the process of apoptosis. The first observation of DNA fragments with the size of 180–200 bp and multiples thereof in glucocorticoid-treated thymocytes was a hallmark in apoptosis research (5Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4153) Google Scholar). In the meantime, the visualization of the characteristic nucleosome (6Olins D.E. Olins A.L. Am. Sci. 1978; 66: 704-711PubMed Google Scholar) size DNA “ladder” is routinely used for the demonstration of apoptosis in many experimental cell systems including the one described here. An apoptosis-specific DNase has been identified that seems to be responsible for the internucleosomal DNA cleavage (7Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar, 8Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2807) Google Scholar). However, it is not fully understood whether apoptotic fragmentation of chromatin occurs randomly or whether this DNase termed CAD1 or DFF40 is capable of recognizing sites within the chromatin that determine preferential cleavage. In addition, the mechanisms as well as the biological function of internucleosomal DNA cleavage are still a matter of debate. On the other hand, it is well known that H1 histones are located at a position adjacent to the nucleosome core (reviewed in Ref. 9Wolffe A.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 12: 1463-1466Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), where they might form a putative recognition site for the enzymatic attack of an internucleosomally cleaving DNase. Thus, we were interested in determining whether the patterns of H1 histones and their posttranslationally modified forms change after induction of apoptosis and, if so, whether these changes might play a role in the regulation of apoptotic DNA cleavage. In this study, we describe the rapid dephosphorylation of certain histone H1 subtypes shortly after induction of apoptosis and before the onset of internucleosomal cleavage. Since the H1 histones are positioned at a candidate site for the initiation of DNA fragmentation, and since it has been already demonstrated that H1 histones can greatly enhance CAD activity in vitro (10Liu X. Zou H. Widlak P. Garrard W. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13836-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), we postulate a role for the phosphorylation state of H1 histone subtypes for the modulation of DNA recognition and/or DNA cleavage by this enzyme. HL60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified air/CO2 (19:1) atmosphere at 37 °C and treated with different drugs as indicated in the figures. After the incubation, cell suspensions (usually 5 × 107 cells/incubation) were centrifuged (5 min, room temperature, 300 × g), and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. 5% perchloric acid was added to the cell pellets, and cells were lysed and extracted by incubation for 1 h at room temperature under continuous stirring. Samples were centrifuged (30 min, 4 °C, 14,000 × g), and the supernatant was stored while the pellet was reextracted once with 5% perchloric acid. Supernatants were collected and centrifuged again. The acid-soluble proteins were precipitated by the addition of 7 volumes of acetone (−20 °C) and overnight incubation at −20 °C. After centrifugation (see above), pellets were washed twice with cold acetone and vacuum-dried. The histones were then dissolved in 30 mmHCl and subjected to further purification (see below). The HL60 cell line (ATCC no. CCL-240) was obtained from Cell Line Service (Heidelberg, Germany). Cell culture reagents and media were purchased from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). All biochemical reagents except topotecan (from SmithKline Beecham) were from Sigma. To induce apoptosis, the human leukemic cell line HL60 was treated with the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan (150 ng/ml) for various times. The process of ongoing apoptosis was monitored by light microscopy and also by isolation of fragmented DNA from apoptotic cells after a method previously described (11Kratzmeier M. Albig W. Meergans T. Doenecke D. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The fragmented DNA from equal amounts of cells was applied onto a 1.5% agarose gel and separated electrophoretically. To analyze the incorporation of phosphate into H1 histones after apoptosis induction, cells from parallel dishes were cultivated in phosphate-free RPMI for 2 h and then treated with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (9.25 MBq/ml of medium) 1 h prior to topotecan treatment. At various times, the cells were washed, and H1 histone subtypes were isolated as described (11Kratzmeier M. Albig W. Meergans T. Doenecke D. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Protein amounts of H1 from equal cell numbers were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue and then scanned and subjected to autoradiography. The autoradiography was analyzed densitometrically, and the amount of incorporated32P was calculated as percentage of the untreated control. H1 histones were purified from histone solutions in 30 mm HCl (see above) by gel filtration (12Huang H.C. Cole R.D. FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 13von Holt C. Brandt W.F. Greyling H.J. Lindsey G.G. Retief J.D. Rodrigues J.D. Schwager S. Sewell B.T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 431-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, solubilized H1 histones were applied onto a Biogel P60 column (Bio-Rad). The application volume was ∼2 ml, and the total amount was ∼100 μg. The column length was 350 mm, and column width was 18 mm. After application, the column was eluted with 30 mm HCl at a constant flow rate of ∼0.3 ml/min. 3.5-min fractions were collected, 20-μl aliquots of all fractions were applied onto a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, and, after running the gel, it was stained with Coomassie Blue for analysis of the elution profile. Fractions containing H1 histones were pooled and, in the case of HL60 histone, concentrated by vacuum-drying and subjected to H1 subtype separation by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC separation method was modified after a method described by Talasz et al. (14Talasz H. Sapojnikova N. Helliger W. Lindner H. Puschendorf B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32236-32243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) to get a better separation of the comigrating human H1 subtypes H1.4 and H1.2. However, we have not achieved quantitative separation of human H1.4 from H1.2 using reversed phase HPLC. To increase the separation efficiency, we used a relatively flat acetonitrile gradient and manual fraction collection. The HPLC unit was a Kontron 450 MT2 system, equipped with an M 420 pump, an M 425 gradient former, and an M 432 variable wavelength detector. 100 μl of total P60-purified H1 histones with a concentration of 100–1000 μg/ml solubilized in 30 mm HCl were loaded onto a Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size; Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Samples were eluted at a constant flow of 1 ml/min, and absorbance of the effluent was monitored at 210 nm. Solvent A was water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B was 59.5% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The elution gradient was as follows: 0–15 min, 0–34% solvent B; 15–82.5 min, 34–64% solvent B. Manually collected samples were freeze-dried, resolubilized in 30 mm HCl, and subjected to further analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) or capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) (see below). CZE was performed on a Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems 270A-HT system. The separation conditions were optimized after a method of Lindner et al.(15Lindner H. Helliger W. Sarg B. Meraner C. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The capillary type was fused silica, length was 122 cm, and inner diameter was 50 μm. Separations were performed at the following conditions: temperature, 30 °C; voltage, 20 kV; current, ∼35 μA; separation time, 50 min; sample injection by pressure; injection time, 2 s; sample protein concentration, ∼0.5 mg/ml; absorbance detection at 200 nm. Separation buffer was 30 mmH3PO4, 60 mm HClO4, 0.02% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), pH 2.00, adjusted with triethylamine. Absorbance data were recorded and analyzed by a PC-based Kontron Integration System. Recombinant human H1 histone H1.2 was prepared from transformed yeast as described (11Kratzmeier M. Albig W. Meergans T. Doenecke D. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Albig W. Runge D.M. Kratzmeier M. Doenecke D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and purified by P60 gel filtration as described above. H1.2 was incubated either with 1 μl of human recombinant cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) or with 0.5 μl of human recombinant protein kinase Cα (Calbiochem, Schwalbach, Germany). The incubation buffer for CDK1 was 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm ATP. Incubation buffer for PKCα was 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm CaCl2, 200 μm ATP with 30% lipid mix (1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 200 μg/ml dioctanoylglycerol (both from Sigma) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.3% Triton X-100). Incubation times were as indicated in the figure legends. Total incubation volume was 13 μl. Incubations were stopped by the addition of 1 μl of 1m HCl and then subjected to analysis by CZE. For the preparation of fragmented DNA, cells were harvested and washed as described for the purification of histone H1 proteins. Preparation of fragmented DNA has been described in Ref. 11Kratzmeier M. Albig W. Meergans T. Doenecke D. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. Briefly, cell pellets were incubated on ice for 30 min in 450 μl of lysis buffer (0.2% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Samples were microcentrifuged (11, 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the nonsedimentable DNA fragments of the supernatants were precipitated by the addition of 450 μl of 2-propanol and 100 μl of 10 mLiCl and incubation at −20 °C overnight. After centrifugation as above, the pellets were washed twice with ice-cold 70% (v/v) ethanol and vacuum-dried. The pellets were then resolubilized in 50 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Samples were extracted twice for DNA with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1), and the purified DNA was again precipitated by the addition of 100 μl of ethanol and 15 μl of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 4.8) and incubation for at least 2 h at −70 °C. After centrifugation as above, pellets were vacuum-dried and solubilized in 30 μl of TE buffer. Extracted DNA was resolved in 1.2% agarose gels using a constant current of 70 mA and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Exponentially growing HL60 cells were pretreated with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 1 h and then treated with the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan at a concentration of 150 ng/ml of medium. At different times after treatment, H1 histones and fragmented DNA were prepared from the cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The H1 histone proteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent autoradiography and also by capillary electrophoresis. The fragmented DNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and then stained and imaged. The data show that topotecan induces DNA fragmentation, becoming visible 3–4 h after treatment of the cells (Fig. 1 A). This apoptotic response of HL60 cells to topoisomerase I inhibitors has already been demonstrated by us and other groups (Ref. 11Kratzmeier M. Albig W. Meergans T. Doenecke D. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 16Kantarjian H. Semin. Hematol. 1999; 36 Suppl. 8: 16-25Google Scholar). The analysis of the H1 histones by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the total amounts of H1 histones extractable from 105 cells did not significantly vary after induction of apoptosis (Fig. 1 B). However, regarding the phosphorylation state of the H1 histones, there was a more than 50% reduction in total H1 phosphorylation, becoming evident already 2 h after topotecan treatment (Figs. 1, C and D). This reduction remained constant throughout the observation time of 8 h. The CZE analysis of H1 histones from untreated versus topotecan-treated HL60 cells had revealed that modified and unmodified forms of H1 subtypes contribute to the total H1 pattern (11Kratzmeier M. Albig W. Meergans T. Doenecke D. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We therefore separated the major H1 histone subtypes present in HL60 cells by reversed phase HPLC before CZE (see “Experimental Procedures”). With this technique, we could quantitatively separate H1.5 from H1.4 and H1.2 (Fig.2 A). Moreover, we achieved a substantial separation of H1.2 from H1.4, as demonstrated by PAGE in Fig. 2 B. This HPLC fractionation allowed us to reanalyze the individual H1 subtypes by CZE (Fig. 2 C) as a prerequisite for the interpretation of the electropherograms that we obtained with total H1 histone preparations (e.g. in Fig.3 A).Figure 3Kinetics of histone H1 dephosphorylation and DNA fragmentation after topotecan treatment. Exponentially growing HL60 cells were treated with topotecan at a final concentration of 150 ng/ml (328 nm) for different times as indicated. After termination of the incubation, cells were harvested, and parallel samples (∼5 × 107 cells each) were further treated for histone H1 purification and CZE separation (Fig. 3 A) or isolation and separation of fragmented DNA (Fig. 3 B), respectively, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”A, CZE absorbance patterns of H1 histones from topotecan-treated cells as a 6-min time period of a 50-min electrophoretic separation. The upper enlarged electropherogram shows the pattern of untreated cells. The identities of the peaks within the total H1 pattern with the three H1 subtypes (H1.2, H1.4, and H1.5) and their monophosphorylated forms (pH1.2, pH1.4, pH1.5) are indicated with arrows. However, in the case of H1.5 and H1.4, there are also diphosphorylated forms within the pattern that comigrate with the peak representing unphosphorylated H1.2 (see overlay in Fig. 2). The lower enlarged electropherogram shows the pattern of H1 histones from cells treated with topotecan for 6 h. The identities of the peaks are also marked with arrows for direct comparison with the pattern from untreated cells. The maximal peak absorbances of the representative samples shown in this figure were 0.020 absorbance units. Aliquots of DNA corresponding to 5 × 106 cells from the same experiment were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel at a con- stant current of 70 mA for 4 h and then stained with ethidium bromide (Fig. 3 B). The DNA size marker was Lambda DNA/EcoRI + HindIII Marker 3 from MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany) (marker bands between 564 and 21,226 bp).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the data shown in Fig. 1 indicate a dephosphorylation of H1 histones after topotecan treatment, we tried to prove whether the additional peaks of the H1 subtypes shown in Fig. 2 C indeed reflect phosphorylated forms of the individual subtypes. Therefore, we performed in vitro protein kinase assays using recombinant human CDK1 and PKCα and recombinant human histone H1.2 as a substrate. The subsequent analysis of the phosphorylation products was done by CZE. As shown in Fig. 2 D, phosphorylation of H1.2 by CDK1 or PKCα resulted in a decrease of the unphosphorylated form. Simultaneously, several additional peaks appeared migrating slower than the unmodified H1.2. They had the same peak distances from the unmodified form as the additional peaks we observed in CZE electropherograms of H1 subtypes from HL60 cells (Fig. 2 C,control). Thus, we conclude that these peaks indeed reflect phosphorylated forms of H1 subtypes. This ability of the capillary zone electrophoresis technique to separate phosphorylated H1 variants has already been demonstrated by Lindner et al. (17Lindner H. Helliger W. Dirschlmayer A. Talasz H. Wurm M. Sarg B. Jaquemar M. Puschendorf B. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 608: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Other groups have independently shown that CZE is capable of separating differentially phosphorylated forms of single proteins because of the total net charge of the molecule as the dominant separation force in CZE (18Dawson J.F. Boland M.P. Holmes C.F. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Wei J. Yang L. Harrata A.K. Lee C.S. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 2356-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Gamble T.N. Ramachandran C. Bateman K.P. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 3469-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the H1 subtypes of untreated cells strongly differed in their phosphorylation state, in such a way that H1.5 and H1.4 were up to 3 times phosphorylated, with a maximum of once and twice phosphorylated forms, whereas H1.2 seemed to be only phosphorylated once. Whether this phosphorylated form of H1.2 is phosphorylated preferentially at a defined serine or threonine residue or whether it represents a mixture of differently, but only once, phosphorylated forms, remains to be determined by tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry analysis of the resulting peptides (see “Discussion”). We performed the same experiment with topotecan-treated cells to analyze the rate of dephosphorylation of individual histone H1 subtypes as indicated by the labeling experiments shown in Fig. 1. H1 histones from 4 × 109 HL60 cells treated for 8 h with 150 ng/ml topotecan were extracted and purified by gel chromatography, and the H1 subtypes were separated by HPLC (Fig. 2 A,right). The peaks eluting from the HPLC were collected, and the individual H1 subtypes were analyzed by PAGE (Fig. 2 B,bottom) and capillary electrophoresis (Fig. 2 C,bottom). As expected from the experiment shown in Fig. 1, all three histone H1 subtypes showed a massive reduction of their phosphorylated subtypes upon topotecan treatment, leading to a relative increase of the respective unphosphorylated forms. The HPLC peak representing H1.4 showed two additional peaks when analyzed by CZE. However, since the separation of H1.4 from H1.2 by HPLC is incomplete, there is an overlay of residual H1.2 with twice phosphorylated H1.4 within the peak eluting last in the electropherogram of H1.4 (see overlay in Fig. 2 C, bottom), making it impossible to quantify the amount of twice phosphorylated H1.4 within the preparation. However, the phosphorylation seen in untreated HL60 cells appears to be, at least partially, H1 subtype-specific (see above), whereas the dephosphorylation differs only in its extent with respect to individual histone H1 subtypes. HL60 cells were incubated in the presence of 150 ng/ml topotecan for different times. After incubation, the cell cultures were split, and half the cells were used for the extraction of H1 histones, while the other half served as a source for the preparation of fragmented DNA. H1 histones were then purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and further analyzed by capillary zone electrophoresis, as described in Ref. 11Kratzmeier M. Albig W. Meergans T. Doenecke D. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. The identification of unmodified histone H1 subtypes had been previously shown by mixing the preparations from cell lines with recombinant proteins purified from transformed yeast (21Albig W. Runge D.M. Kratzmeier M. Doenecke D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mixing e.g.H1.2 with the H1 preparation from human cell lines had resulted in the selective increase of one single peak, indicating that this peak represents H1.2 within the mixed preparation. These mixing experiments had been done with all human recombinant subtypes except H1t, which is exclusively expressed in the testis (22Drabent B. Bode C. Doenecke D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 311-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The identities of the peaks with the respective H1 histone subtypes are indicated in the upper (control cells) and lower panel (6-h topotecan-treated cells) of Fig.3 A. Isolation of fragmented DNA was done by treatment of the cells with a buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Experimental details are given under “Experimental Procedures.” The fragmented DNA was purified by organic extraction and electrophoretically separated on a 1.25% agarose gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and digitally imaged (Fig. 3 B). The CZE analysis revealed that already 45 min after topotecan treatment, a significant change in the total H1 subtype pattern could be observed, leading to an increase in the amounts of unmodified H1 subtypes H1.4 and H1.5, whereas other peaks presumably representing phosphorylated H1 subtypes simultaneously decreased (Fig.3 A). However, nucleosomal DNA fragments could not be detected before 3 h of topotecan treatment (Fig. 3 B). This indicates that the putative protein phosphatases or protein kinase inhibitors that are responsible for the dephosphorylation of H1 histones after apoptosis induction may be activated by a mechanism that acts upstream of the caspase 3-dependent activation of CAD/DFF40. To determine if the dephosphorylation of H1 histones in the course of apoptosis induction could be influenced by phosphatase inhibition, we treated the cells with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A, a substance that is about equally potent in inhibiting type 1 and 2 protein phosphatases. Incubation of HL60 cells with a concentration of 30 nm calyculin A for 8 h resulted in a significant hyperphosphorylation of H1 histones (Fig.4 F). We then were interested in determining whether protein phosphatase inhibition could influence the sensitivity of HL60 cells toward apoptotic inducers such as topotecan. We therefore treated the cells for 8 h with increasing concentrations of calyculin A (3, 10, and 30 nm) and simultaneously with a constant concentration of topotecan (150 ng/ml). After treatment, the cells were washed and subjected to the extraction of H1 histones on one hand as well as analysis of DNA fragmentation on the other hand. We observed that the lower molecular weight DNA fragmentation caused by topotecan treatment was diminished in the presence of 3 nm calyculin A, and higher molecular weight fragments remained in the upper parts of the respective lanes (Fig. 4 G). Moreover, with higher concentrations of calyculin A we observed a reduction in the total amount of fragmented DNA per given cell number, suggesting that internucleosomal DNA fragmentation is reduced by simultaneous protein phosphatase inhibition. The pattern of H1 histones showed an increase in peaks putatively representing phosphorylated H1 histone subtypes after treatment with topotecan and calyculin A at the same time (Fig. 4, C–E). This hyperphosphorylation could be observed with 3 nm of calyculin A but was more pronounced with higher concentrations. The pattern observed with 30 nm of calyculin A and 150 ng/ml topotecan (Fig. 4 E) was very similar to that with 30 nm of calyculin A alone (Fig. 4 F), implying that the effect of protein phosphatase inhibition, leading to a dramatic hyperphosphorylation of H1 histones, was dominant over the dephosphorylating effect of topotecan treatment. The role of protein kinase C activation within the signaling process of apoptosis has been discussed in the literature rather controversially (reviewed in Ref. 23Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Proapoptotic as well as a series of antiapoptotic effects have been reported, depending on the different tissue model systems (24Zhu W.H. Loh T.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Kaneko Y.S. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. Life Sci. 1999; 65: 2251-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We therefore were interested in the effects of protein kinase C activation on DNA fragmentation and apoptosis as induced by the inhibition of topoisomerase I. HL60 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml PMA, 150 ng/ml topotecan, or both substances for 6 h. After incubation, H1 histones and fragmented DNA were isolated as described. The results are shown in Fig.5. It is obvious that PMA treatment resulted in an overall increase of the relative amount of phosphorylated H1 subtypes, leading to a decrease of the peaks representing the unphosphorylated H1 histones H1.4 and H1.5, while the latest peak representing mainly monophosphorylated H1.2 increased (Fig. 5 B). Treatment of the cells with both PMA and topotecan (Fig. 5 D) led to a CZE pattern, which highly resembled the pattern obtained with topotecan alone (Fig.5 C), indicating that in this case, the dephosphorylating effect of topotecan is dominant over the induction of H1 phosphorylation by PMA. Regarding the DNA fragmentation pattern (Fig.5 E), PMA alone did not induce DNA fragment formation by itself but instead was capable of reducing the DNA fragmentation capacity of topotecan. This suggests that in the HL60 promyelocytic cell l"

These observations suggest that CS-E or GalNAc (4,6-bis-SO4) residues at the nonreducing terminal of chondroitin sulfate should play important roles in various cellular interactions.Sulfotransferases capable of producing GalNAc(4,6-bis-SO4) residues have been examined in squid cartilage (24Habuchi O.

The sulfotransferase from the quail oviduct and human serum mainly catalyzed sulfation of position 6 of nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4-SO4) residues (25Nakanishi Y. Shimizu M. Otsu K. Kato S. Tsuji M.

However, strict substrate specificities of these sulfotransferases are still obscure because no homogeneous preparations of these sulfotransferases have been obtained. In the present study, we purified to apparent homogeneity a sulfotransferase from squid cartilage that transfers sulfate to position 6 of the GalNAc(4-SO4) residue of chondroitin sulfate. This sulfotransferase was found to transfer sulfate to position 6 of both internal and nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4-SO4) residue. Thus, this enzyme may be described as an N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4S-6ST).DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have purified GalNAc4S-6ST to apparent homogeneity. The purified sulfotransferase showed two protein bands on SDS-PAGE after N-glycosidase F digestion as observed in C6ST (32Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol.

Although the identity of the two protein bands is not clear at present, it is possible that both protein bands correspond to GalNAc4S-6ST because the protein bands were both coeluted with GalNAc4S-6ST activity from Toyopearl HW-55. GalNAc4S-6ST activity was increased after removal of endogenous proteoglycans. The observed increase in the sulfotransferase activity after the protamine precipitation may be due mainly to the removal of proteoglycans with inhibitory activity to the sulfotransferase because the purified GalNAc4S-6ST was strongly inhibited with CS-E from squid cartilage (Fig. 5). Affinity chromatography on 3′,5′-ADP-agarose was critical for the purification. The concentration of NaCl required for the elution of the enzyme from 3′,5′-ADP-agarose was very high, suggesting that the affinity of GalNAc4S-6ST for 3′,5′-ADP-agarose is higher than for any other glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases so far purified.GalNAc4S-6ST activity was activated by Ca2+; the optimum concentration of Ca2+ was 20 mm for CS-A and 100 mm for DS. Although the reason that DS requires a higher concentration of Ca2+ than CS-A is not clear, it is possible that the difference in the optimal concentration of Ca2+ between DS and CS-A may reflect the different conformation of these glycosaminoglycans induced by the addition of Ca2+. Reduced glutathione was found to activate GalNAc4S-6ST activity as observed in C4ST (39Yamauchi S. Hirahara Y. Usui H. Takeda Y. Hoshino M. Fukuta M. Kimura J.H. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2456-2463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) but the degree of the activation was much lower than that observed for C4ST.Both CS-A and CS-C served as good acceptors. The incorporation of35S-labeled SO4 into these glycosaminoglycans was closely related to the ratio of GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4-SO4)/GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(6-SO4); the lower ratio resulted in the lower activity, suggesting that GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(6-SO4) unit may have an inhibitory effect on the activity of GalNAc4S-6ST. CS-E was not an acceptor but was an inhibitor for GalNAc4S-6ST, suggesting that GalNAc4S-6ST may be inhibited by the reaction products as suggested previously (24Habuchi O. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7357-7365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DS was sulfated at IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4-SO4) units because35S-labeled DS was not degraded by chondroitinase ACII but was degraded by chondroitinase ABC. Such specificity of GalNAc4S-6ST contrasts clearly with the specificity of C4ST; C4ST preferentially sulfated position 4 of GalNAc residue contained in glucuronic acid-rich regions of desulfated dermatan sulfate (39Yamauchi S.

Sulfation of CS-A and DS seems to be catalyzed by the same enzyme because two activities were coeluted with Toyopearl HW-55, and the sulfation of CS-A and the sulfation of DS were inhibited by DS and CS-A, respectively. However, at present, the possibility remains that each of the two protein bands observed after N-glycosidase F digestion may have a preference for either of these glycosaminoglycans. TheK m for DS was much smaller than theK m for CS-A. Glycosaminoglycans containing IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-bis-SO4) units were reported to be present in hag fish notochord (18Anno K. Seno N. Mathews M.B. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 237: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), rat glomeruli (16Kobayashi S. Oguri K. Yaoita E. Kobayashi K. Okayama M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 841: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and rat mesangial cells (17Yaoita E. Oguri K. Okayama E. Kawasaki K. Kobayashi S. Kihara I. Okayama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 522-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfotransferases involved in the biosynthesis of these glycosaminoglycans may have substrate specificity similar to that of GalNAc4S-6ST.The purified GalNAc4S-6ST was shown to transfer sulfate efficiently to position 6 of nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4-SO4) residues when a 4-sulfated trisaccharide and a 4-sulfated pentasaccharide were used as acceptors. However, sulfation of nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4-SO4) residue appears to be suppressed by the substitution of a GlcA residue because the proportion of35S radioactivity of GalNAc(4,6-bis-SO4) released from the 35S-labeled tetrasaccharide after digestion with β-glucuronidase and chondroitinase ACII was much smaller than the proportion of the radioactivity of GalNAc(4,6-bis-SO4) released from the35S-labeled trisaccharide or pentasaccharide. TheK m for the trisaccharide was higher than theK m for CS-A by about ten-fold, indicating that molecular size of the acceptor may contribute to the affinity between the acceptors and the enzyme.Squid skin chondroitin was sulfated, but sulfate was transferred to position 6 of internal or nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4-SO4) residues, which were minor components of chondroitin. These results clearly indicate that GalNAc4S-6ST absolutely requires the presence of GalNAc(4-SO4) residues for the activity. Proportion of ΔDi-4S released after chondroitinase ACII digestion of squid skin chondroitin to the total unsaturated disaccharides was about 0.2%. The concentration of internal GalNAc(4-SO4) residue in the reaction mixtures was thus calculated as 1 × 10−6m. Because theK m for CS-A was 1.1 × 10−6m, sulfation of GalNAc(4-SO4) residues contained in chondroitin may also occur.We have previously purified and cloned C6ST (44Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The purified C6ST transferred sulfate to position 6 of GalNAc residues of chondroitin and Gal residues of keratan sulfate (38Habuchi O. Hirahara Y. Uchimura K. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or sialylN-acetyllactosamine oligosaccharides (40Habuchi O. Suzuki Y. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, C6ST could not catalyze the sulfation of GalNAc(4-SO4) residues even when CS-A was used as acceptor. In contrast, the purified GalNAc4S-6ST from squid cartilage could not transfer sulfate to the GalNAc residues of chondroitin.At present, it is not clear whether sulfotransferases with the substrate specificity similar to the specificity of squid GalNAc4S-6ST are present in the vertebral tissues. GalNAc4S-6ST activity was reported in the human serum (26Inoue H. Otsu K. Yoneda M. Kimata K. Suzuki S. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4460-4469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Inoue H. Otsu K. Suzuki S. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1981; 256: 5443-5449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but these sulfotransferases may be distinguished from the squid GalNAc4S-6ST in the substrate specificity because when chondroitin sulfate was used as acceptor, both human and quail enzymes transferred sulfate preferentially to position 6 of nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4-SO4) residues, whereas the purified squid GalNAc4S-6ST transferred sulfate mainly to the internal GalNAc(4-SO4) residues. Molecular cloning of the squid GalNAc4S-6ST would offer important clue about the molecular nature of the sulfotransferase involved in the biosynthesis of CS-E in the vertebral tissues. Chondroitin sulfate E (CS-E)1 contains a repeating disaccharide, GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-bis-SO4), and was originally found in squid cartilage (1Kawai Y. Seno N. Anno K. J. Biochem.

Seno N. Mathews M.B. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 237: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The GalNAc(4,6-bis-SO4) residue was also found in the nonreducing terminal of chondroitin sulfate (19Otsu K. Inoue H. Tsuzuki Y. Yonekura H. Nakanishi Y. Suzuki S. Biochem.

The proportion of the nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4,6-bis-SO4) residue of aggrecan was found to be decreased in human osteoarthritis (22Plaas A.H.K. West L.A. Wong-Palms S. Nelson F.R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The anticoagulant activity of thrombomodulin was reported to depend on the presence of chondroitin sulfate having GalNAc(4,6-bis-SO4) residues at the nonreducing end (23Bourin M.-C. Lundgren-Åkerlund E. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15424-15431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that CS-E or GalNAc (4,6-bis-SO4) residues at the nonreducing terminal of chondroitin sulfate should play important roles in various cellular interactions. Sulfotransferases capable of producing GalNAc(4,6-bis-SO4) residues have been examined in squid cartilage (24Habuchi O. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7357-7365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), quail oviduct (25Nakanishi Y. Shimizu M. Otsu K. Kato S. Tsuji M. Suzuki S. J. Biol.

The sulfotransferase from the quail oviduct and human serum mainly catalyzed sulfation of position 6 of nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4-SO4) residues (25Nakanishi Y. Shimizu M. Otsu K. Kato S. Tsuji M. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5443-5449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Inoue H. Otsu K. Yoneda M. Kimata K. Suzuki S. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 4470-4475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, strict substrate specificities of these sulfotransferases are still obscure because no homogeneous preparations of these sulfotransferases have been obtained. In the present study, we purified to apparent homogeneity a sulfotransferase from squid cartilage that transfers sulfate to position 6 of the GalNAc(4-SO4) residue of chondroitin sulfate. This sulfotransferase was found to transfer sulfate to position 6 of both internal and nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4-SO4) residue. Thus, this enzyme may be described as an N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4S-6ST). DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have purified GalNAc4S-6ST to apparent homogeneity. The purified sulfotransferase showed two protein bands on SDS-PAGE after N-glycosidase F digestion as observed in C6ST (32Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol.

Although the identity of the two protein bands is not clear at present, it is possible that both protein bands correspond to GalNAc4S-6ST because the protein bands were both coeluted with GalNAc4S-6ST activity from Toyopearl HW-55. GalNAc4S-6ST activity was increased after removal of endogenous proteoglycans. The observed increase in the sulfotransferase activity after the protamine precipitation may be due mainly to the removal of proteoglycans with inhibitory activity to the sulfotransferase because the purified GalNAc4S-6ST was strongly inhibited with CS-E from squid cartilage (Fig. 5). Affinity chromatography on 3′,5′-ADP-agarose was critical for the purification.

The incorporation of35S-labeled SO4 into these glycosaminoglycans was closely related to the ratio of GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4-SO4)/GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(6-SO4); the lower ratio resulted in the lower activity, suggesting that GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(6-SO4) unit may have an inhibitory effect on the activity of GalNAc4S-6ST. CS-E was not an acceptor but was an inhibitor for GalNAc4S-6ST, suggesting that GalNAc4S-6ST may be inhibited by the reaction products as suggested previously (24Habuchi O. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7357-7365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DS was sulfated at IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4-SO4) units because35S-labeled DS was not degraded by chondroitinase ACII but was degraded by chondroitinase ABC. Such specificity of GalNAc4S-6ST contrasts clearly with the specificity of C4ST; C4ST preferentially sulfated position 4 of GalNAc residue contained in glucuronic acid-rich regions of desulfated dermatan sulfate (39Yamauchi S.

These results clearly indicate that GalNAc4S-6ST absolutely requires the presence of GalNAc(4-SO4) residues for the activity. Proportion of ΔDi-4S released after chondroitinase ACII digestion of squid skin chondroitin to the total unsaturated disaccharides was about 0.2%. The concentration of internal GalNAc(4-SO4) residue in the reaction mixtures was thus calculated as 1 × 10−6m. Because theK m for CS-A was 1.1 × 10−6m, sulfation of GalNAc(4-SO4) residues contained in chondroitin may also occur.We have previously purified and cloned C6ST (44Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K.

Although the identity of the two protein bands is not clear at present, it is possible that both protein bands correspond to GalNAc4S-6ST because the protein bands were both coeluted with GalNAc4S-6ST activity from Toyopearl HW-55. GalNAc4S-6ST activity was increased after removal of endogenous proteoglycans. The observed increase in the sulfotransferase activity after the protamine precipitation may be due mainly to the removal of proteoglycans with inhibitory activity to the sulfotransferase because the purified GalNAc4S-6ST was strongly inhibited with CS-E from squid cartilage (Fig. 5). Affinity chromatography on 3′,5′-ADP-agarose was critical for the purification. The concentration of NaCl required for the elution of the enzyme from 3′,5′-ADP-agarose was very high, suggesting that the affinity of GalNAc4S-6ST for 3′,5′-ADP-agarose is higher than for any other glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases so far purified. GalNAc4S-6ST activity was activated by Ca2+; the optimum concentration of Ca2+ was 20 mm for CS-A and 100 mm for DS. Although the reason that DS requires a higher concentration of Ca2+ than CS-A is not clear, it is possible that the difference in the optimal concentration of Ca2+ between DS and CS-A may reflect the different conformation of these glycosaminoglycans induced by the addition of Ca2+. Reduced glutathione was found to activate GalNAc4S-6ST activity as observed in C4ST (39Yamauchi S. Hirahara Y. Usui H. Takeda Y. Hoshino M. Fukuta M. Kimura J.H. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2456-2463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) but the degree of the activation was much lower than that observed for C4ST. Both CS-A and CS-C served as good acceptors. The incorporation of35S-labeled SO4 into these glycosaminoglycans was closely related to the ratio of GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4-SO4)/GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(6-SO4); the lower ratio resulted in the lower activity, suggesting that GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(6-SO4) unit may have an inhibitory effect on the activity of GalNAc4S-6ST. CS-E was not an acceptor but was an inhibitor for GalNAc4S-6ST, suggesting that GalNAc4S-6ST may be inhibited by the reaction products as suggested previously (24Habuchi O. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7357-7365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DS was sulfated at IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4-SO4) units because35S-labeled DS was not degraded by chondroitinase ACII but was degraded by chondroitinase ABC. Such specificity of GalNAc4S-6ST contrasts clearly with the specificity of C4ST; C4ST preferentially sulfated position 4 of GalNAc residue contained in glucuronic acid-rich regions of desulfated dermatan sulfate (39Yamauchi S.

Sulfation of CS-A and DS seems to be catalyzed by the same enzyme because two activities were coeluted with Toyopearl HW-55, and the sulfation of CS-A and the sulfation of DS were inhibited by DS and CS-A, respectively. However, at present, the possibility remains that each of the two protein bands observed after N-glycosidase F digestion may have a preference for either of these glycosaminoglycans. TheK m for DS was much smaller than theK m for CS-A. Glycosaminoglycans containing IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-bis-SO4) units were reported to be present in hag fish notochord (18Anno K. Seno N. Mathews M.B. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 237: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), rat glomeruli (16Kobayashi S. Oguri K. Yaoita E. Kobayashi K. Okayama M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 841: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and rat mesangial cells (17Yaoita E. Oguri K. Okayama E. Kawasaki K. Kobayashi S. Kihara I. Okayama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 522-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfotransferases involved in the biosynthesis of these glycosaminoglycans may have substrate specificity similar to that of GalNAc4S-6ST. The purified GalNAc4S-6ST was shown to transfer sulfate efficiently to position 6 of nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4-SO4) residues when a 4-sulfated trisaccharide and a 4-sulfated pentasaccharide were used as acceptors. However, sulfation of nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4-SO4) residue appears to be suppressed by the substitution of a GlcA residue because the proportion of35S radioactivity of GalNAc(4,6-bis-SO4) released from the 35S-labeled tetrasaccharide after digestion with β-glucuronidase and chondroitinase ACII was much smaller than the proportion of the radioactivity of GalNAc(4,6-bis-SO4) released from the35S-labeled trisaccharide or pentasaccharide. TheK m for the trisaccharide was higher than theK m for CS-A by about ten-fold, indicating that molecular size of the acceptor may contribute to the affinity between the acceptors and the enzyme. Squid skin chondroitin was sulfated, but sulfate was transferred to position 6 of internal or nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4-SO4) residues, which were minor components of chondroitin. These results clearly indicate that GalNAc4S-6ST absolutely requires the presence of GalNAc(4-SO4) residues for the activity. Proportion of ΔDi-4S released after chondroitinase ACII digestion of squid skin chondroitin to the total unsaturated disaccharides was about 0.2%. The concentration of internal GalNAc(4-SO4) residue in the reaction mixtures was thus calculated as 1 × 10−6m. Because theK m for CS-A was 1.1 × 10−6m, sulfation of GalNAc(4-SO4) residues contained in chondroitin may also occur. We have previously purified and cloned C6ST (44Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The purified C6ST transferred sulfate to position 6 of GalNAc residues of chondroitin and Gal residues of keratan sulfate (38Habuchi O. Hirahara Y. Uchimura K. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or sialylN-acetyllactosamine oligosaccharides (40Habuchi O. Suzuki Y. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, C6ST could not catalyze the sulfation of GalNAc(4-SO4) residues even when CS-A was used as acceptor. In contrast, the purified GalNAc4S-6ST from squid cartilage could not transfer sulfate to the GalNAc residues of chondroitin. At present, it is not clear whether sulfotransferases with the substrate specificity similar to the specificity of squid GalNAc4S-6ST are present in the vertebral tissues. GalNAc4S-6ST activity was reported in the human serum (26Inoue H. Otsu K. Yoneda M. Kimata K. Suzuki S. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4460-4469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Inoue H. Otsu K. Suzuki S. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1981; 256: 5443-5449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but these sulfotransferases may be distinguished from the squid GalNAc4S-6ST in the substrate specificity because when chondroitin sulfate was used as acceptor, both human and quail enzymes transferred sulfate preferentially to position 6 of nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4-SO4) residues, whereas the purified squid GalNAc4S-6ST transferred sulfate mainly to the internal GalNAc(4-SO4) residues. Molecular cloning of the squid GalNAc4S-6ST would offer important clue about the molecular nature of the sulfotransferase involved in the biosynthesis of CS-E in the vertebral tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2080773971,"Squamous differentiation of keratinocytes is associated with decreases in E2F-1 mRNA expression and E2F activity, and these processes are disrupted in squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. We now show that E2F-1 mRNA expression is increased in primary squamous cell carcinomas of the skin relative to normal epidermis. To explore the relationship between E2F-1 and squamous differentiation further, we examined the effect of altering E2F activity in primary human keratinocytes induced to differentiate. Promoter activity for the proliferation-associated genes, cdc2 and keratin 14, are inhibited during squamous differentiation. This inhibition can be inhibited by overexpression of E2F-1 in keratinocytes. Overexpression of E2F-1 also suppressed the expression of differentiation markers (transglutaminase type 1 and keratin 10) in differentiated keratinocytes. Blocking E2F activity by transfecting proliferating keratinocytes with dominant negative E2F-1 constructs inhibited the expression of cdc2 and E2F-1, but did not induce differentiation. Furthermore, expression of the dominant negative construct in epithelial carcinoma cell lines and normal keratinocytes decreased expression from the cdc2 promoter. These data indicate that E2F-1 promotes keratinocyte proliferation-specific marker genes and suppresses squamous differentiation-specific marker genes. Moreover, these data indicate that targeted disruption of E2F-1 activity may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of squamous carcinomas. Oncogene (2000)."

https://openalex.org/W2048613455,"We recently described germline and somatic mutations in the MET gene associated with papillary renal carcinoma type 1. MET mutation M1268T was located in a codon highly conserved among receptor tyrosine kinases, and homologous to the codon mutated in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B, and many cases of sporadic medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland (Ret M918T). Ret M918T and MET M1268T have previously been shown to be highly active in mouse NIH3T3 transformation assays, and to change the substrate specificity of the kinase. We studied the mechanism of transformation mediated by MET M1268T by analysing a clone, F4, derived from NIH3T3 cells transformed by MET M1268T. In contrast to NIH3T3 cells, F4 cells grew in suspension in tissue culture, and rapidly formed tumors in nude mice. We found that c-Src was constitutively bound to MET proteins in F4 cells, and that Src kinase activity was elevated. Transfection of dominant negative Src constructs into F4 cells eliminated the ability of F4 cells to grow in suspension culture and retarded the growth of F4 cells in vivo. The ability of transfected dominant negative Src constructs to inhibit the growth of F4 cells correlated with the inhibition of phosphorylation of paxillin and focal adhesion kinase. Transfection of dominant negative Src constructs into F4 cells had no effect on Grb2 binding or PLC gamma phosphorylation. The results suggest that c-Src participates in the tumorigenic phenotype induced in NIH3T3 cells by MET M1268T by signaling through focal adhesion kinase and paxillin. Oncogene (2000)."

https://openalex.org/W2166636567,"CLIC-1 is a member of a family of proteins related to the bovine intracellular chloride channel p64 which has been proposed to function as a chloride channel. We expressed CLIC-1 as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in bacteria. The fusion protein was purified by glutathione affinity, and CLIC-1 was released from its fusion partner by digestion with thrombin. After further purification, CLIC-1 was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles by detergent dialysis. Chloride permeability of reconstituted vesicles was assessed using a valinomycin dependent chloride efflux assay, demonstrating increased vesicular chloride permeability with CLIC-1 compared with control. CLIC-1-dependent chloride permeability was inhibited by indanyloxyacetic acid-94 with an apparent IC(50) of 8.6 micrometer. The single channel properties of CLIC-1 were determined using the planar lipid bilayer technique. We found that CLIC-1 forms a voltage-dependent, Cl-selective channel with a rectifying current-voltage relationship and single channel conductances of 161 +/- 7.9 and 67.5 +/- 6.9 picosiemens in symmetric 300 and 150 mm KCl, respectively. The anion selectivity of this activity is Br approximately Cl > I. The open probability of CLIC-1 channels in planar bilayers was decreased by indanyloxyacetic acid-94 with an apparent IC(50) of 86 micrometer at 50 mV. These data convincingly demonstrate that CLIC-1 is capable of forming a novel, chloride-selective channel in the absence of other subunits or proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2038039917,"A number of previous reports have suggested that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are present in the plasma membranes of cells. We confirm this directly in the present study by demonstrating that a significant proportion of the IP3Rs found in A431 cells, Jurkat cells, and rat parotid acini can be biotinylated by the extracellular application of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin to intact cells. This labeling cannot be accounted for by the reaction of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin with intracellular IP3Rs since calnexin and the SERCA2 ATPase, both integral membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum, are not labeled under the same experimental conditions. Individual IP3R subtypes were detected using subtype-specific antibodies. A431 cells expressed only the type-3 IP3R, and 23% of this protein was in the biotinylated (plasma membrane) fraction. Jurkat cells and rat parotid cells expressed all three IP3R subtypes. Contrary to earlier results suggesting that only the type-3 IP3R might localize to the plasma membrane, we found that significant amounts (5–14%) of all three subtypes could be identified in the biotinylated fractions of Jurkat and rat parotid cells. Our results suggest a role for IP3Rs in plasma membrane as well as intracellular membrane function."
https://openalex.org/W2088551741,"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP1 is a crucial component of the mammalian restriction point, and as such is subject to multiple regulatory mechanisms. It has recently been shown that the abundance of p27KIP1 is also regulated during apoptosis; p27KIP1 is cleaved by a Z-VAD-fmk-sensitive caspase during apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation in endothelial cells, and also following exposure of myeloid leukaemia cells to etoposide. Here, we investigate p27KIP1 regulation in B- and T-lymphoid cells undergoing apoptosis. We observe that p27KIP1 is down-regulated following exposure to a variety of apoptotic stimuli including an agonistic anti-Fas antibody, cycloheximide and etoposide. Further investigation revealed the existence of two different routes of p27KIP1 regulation in lymphoid cells undergoing apoptosis. The first pathway is utilized by lymphoid cells stimulated through Fas, is abrogated in a caspase-8-deficient T-cell line, and is blocked by the caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk and Boc-D-fmk. In contrast, the loss of p27KIP1 in cells exposed to cycloheximide and etoposide occurs in the absence of caspase-8 or any Z-VAD-fmk- or Boc-D-fmk-sensitive caspase activities. Thus the down-regulation of p27KIP1 is a common occurrence in lymphoid cells undergoing apoptosis but, depending on the apoptotic trigger, this can be affected by two different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2065136893,"The p53 tumour suppressor phosphoprotein associates with proteins involved in DNA replication, transcription, cell cycle machinery and regulation of its own expression. Recently it has been shown that p53 can also bind to trk A tyrosine kinase which is the receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF). This study demonstrates that p53 appears to associate with trk A via c-abl. Endogenous c-abl was detected when the trk A and p53 complex was immunoprecipitated from lysates of NGF stimulated NIH3T3 cells expressing trk A or NIH3T3 cells expressing trk A and a temperature sensitive p53 (val 135). Endogenous c-abl and trk A association was observed in NGF stimulated p53 negative fibroblasts transfected with trk A alone; suggesting that c-abl can independently bind to trk A in the absence of p53. Interestingly, association between endogenous p53 and trk A was not detected in NGF stimulated abl negative fibroblasts transfected with trk A or when these cells were exposed to gamma radiation. This result suggests that p53 preferentially binds to trk A in the presence of c-abl and that p53 and trk A do not appear to associate directly even if p53 is activated and its levels increased by gamma radiation. Overall, these data suggest that c-abl is possibly acting as an adaptor or bridge between p53 and trk A. Oncogene (2000)."
https://openalex.org/W1965006885,"The major yeast glycogen synthase, Gsy2p, is inactivated by phosphorylation and activated by the allosteric ligand glucose-6-P. From studies of recombinant proteins, the control can be accommodated by a three-state model, in which unphosphorylated enzyme has intermediate activity (state II). Glucose-6-P increasedV max/K m by about 2-fold (state III), whereas phosphorylation by the cyclin-dependent protein kinase Pcl10p/Pho85p decreasedV max/K m by ∼30-fold (state I). In the presence of glucose-6-P, state III is achieved regardless of phosphorylation state. The enzyme forms complexes in solution with the yeast glycogenin Glg2p, but this interaction appears not to affect control either by glucose-6-P binding or by phosphorylation. Scanning mutagenesis was applied to identify residues potentially involved in ligand binding. Of 22 mutant enzymes analyzed, seven were essentially inactive. Five mutant proteins were altered in their activation by glucose-6-P, and two were completely unaffected by the hexose phosphate. One of these, R586A/R588A/R591A (all three of the indicated Arg residues mutated to Ala), had wild-type activity and was normally inactivated by phosphorylation. A second mutant, R579A/R580A/R582A, had somewhat reduced V max, but its activity was not greatly reduced by phosphorylation. The Arg residues in these two mutants are restricted to a highly conserved, 13-residue segment of Gsy2p that we propose to be important for glucose-6-P binding and/or the ability of the enzyme to undergo transitions between activity states."
https://openalex.org/W2319753363,"We have previously demonstrated that overexpression of Sam68 functionally substitutes for, as well as synergizes with, HIV-1 Rev in RRE-mediated gene expression and virus replication. In addition, we have shown that the C-terminal deletion mutants of Sam68 act with a transdominant negative phenotype in HIV replication. Previously, an Arginine429 mutation within the C-terminal domain of Sam68 has been reported to be critical for the localization of Sam68 in the nucleus. However, these studies were done in the context of truncated protein in which C-terminal amino acids 420 - 443 of Sam68 were fused to GFP. In contrast, we now report that the full length Sam68 protein having the same mutation (Arginine429-->Alanine) is completely localized in the nucleus while another Sam68 (Proline439-->Arginine) mutant is found in the cytoplasm. The localization of these Sam68 mutant proteins also correlates with their function in RRE-mediated reporter gene expression, i.e. Sam68 mutant protein that is localized in the cytoplasm failed to enhance RRE-mediated transactivation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Sam68 P439-->R inhibited the transactivation of RRE-mediated gene expression by both wild type Sam68 and Rev. These results indicate that the proline residue at position 439 unlike arginine at position 429, may play a critical role in targeting Sam68 protein to nucleus. We propose that these negative dominant mutants of Sam68 may have potential as anti-viral agents to combat AIDS."
