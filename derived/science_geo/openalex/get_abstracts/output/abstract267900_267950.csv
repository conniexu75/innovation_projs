https://openalex.org/W2087526202,"Injection of actinomycin D into rats completely prevents both the rise in serum calcium normally induced by vitamin D and the increased transport of calcium by everted intestinal sacs. Injection of excess parathyroid hormone did not alter this result; this eliminates the possibility that the inhibition of vitamin action was due to blocked hormone synthesis. As a result of these findings, a hypothesis concerning the mechanism of action of vitamin D is presented."

Arterial and mixed-venous oxygen tensions decreased on average 7.3 and 13.3 percent, respectively. One of five subjects developed evidence of mild left-ventricular dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2015328648,"Phytotoxic material has been isolated from liquid cultures of Ceratocystis ulmi. One component of the material has been obtained in pure form and has proved to be a rather thermostable glycoprotein. This compound induced disease symptoms, similar to those produced by the fungus itself, in elm sprouits and trees."
https://openalex.org/W1983509663,"Discrete genetic loci, believed to have evolved by gene duplication, control the synthesis of related but not identical polypeptide chains in the hemoglobins (1). Partial gene duplication has been suggested as the mechanism for the evolution of the Hp2 allele in the haptoglobin system (2, 3). Intergenic crossing-over between regions of homology in such related genes has been established in both the haptoglobin (3, 4) and hemoglobin (5) systems. I have suggested (6) comparable intragenic crossing-over may occur somatically in the genes controlling antibody structure and the resulting chromosomal rearrangements could account for variations in the structure of the polypeptides of different antibodies. At time I made no reference to any selective (7) or instructive (8) mechanisms for the induction of antibody responses since the control of antibody structures did not appear to be necessarily coupled with either mechanism for antibody induction. I now propose a hypothesis for antibody induction and the control of tolerance which suggests both selective and instructive stages may participate in the overall process. In developing the hypothesis I have necessarily considered principles and ideas discussed by other writers. Particularly I draw attention to a discussion by Burnet (9) and a paper by Jerne et al. (10) which raise considerable doubt a simple process of clonal selection and subsequent cell division can account for the rapidity of the primary response and the large proportion of responding to a given antigen. Jerne et al. offer several interpretations of their own data, including the ideas cells initially stimulated release a self-replicating RNA which infects a number of of the plasma cell series or that an episomal gene cod-"
https://openalex.org/W2002427702,"Bacteria can be used to measure the formation of specific antibody by suspensions of single spleen cells. The technique, based on localized immune lysis (plaque formation) in agar, permits assays on the kinetics of increase in the number of cells forming bactericidal antibody in the spleen of immunized mice. The procedure also is useful for testing nonspecific stimulation of antibody synthesis and for analyzing spleen cell populations from donors that have been immunized simultaneously with bacterial and red blood cell antigens."

The presence of ""Pox Pottery"" in both coastal Guerrero and the Tehuacan Valley might provide evidence as to the type of environment in which this change first occurred."
https://openalex.org/W1987757250,Hexamethylenetetramine hexahydrate has a three-dimensional framework structure of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Each hexamethylenetetramine molecule is located in a cavity within this framework but is linked to the water structure by hydrogen-bonds through three of its four nitrogen atoms.

https://openalex.org/W2013551985,"X-ray diffraction analysis of the particulate matter of water samples from the Caribbean Sea, one from the surface and one from a depth of 768 meters, shows that the material has a mineral composition comparable to that found in deep-sea sediments of the area. The minerals found in the water samples include illite, the most abundant clay; kaolinite; chlorite; talc; mixed-layer clay; quartz; feldspar; and amphibole. Kaolinite and chlorite are more abundant relative to illite in the sediments than in the suspended material."
https://openalex.org/W1988618024,"Absolute thresholds in response to red light were compared in nine normal subjects, six female carriers of protanopia (heterozygotes), and six male subjects with protanopia. The fovea and four peripheral retinal areas were tested, and all data were obtained before the occurrence of the rod-cone break. Elevated thresholds were found in all retinal areas tested in protanopic males, at the fovea in all carriers, and in some peripheral retinal areas in two carriers. The thresholds for carriers were far below those for the protanopic males, and no greater variability of threshold was found in the carriers when they were compared with the normal control group. The findings do not substantiate the occurrence of inactivation at the locus on the X chromosome for protanopia."
https://openalex.org/W2014251721,"Extreme hypersensitivity to cold can be induced in the rat by a single subcutaneous injection of carrageenin. In animals so treated, exposure to cold induces necrotizing thrombohemorrhagic lesions in the nose, paws, and tail, accompanied by renal lesions resembling those of the generalized Sanarelli-Shwartzman phenomenon. The same treatment elicits hemorrhagic necroses of transplants of Murphy lymphosarcomas in rats."

Reticulocytosis induced by massive bleeding or by treatment with acetylphenylhydrazine is characterized by a five- to sixfold increase in red-cell transaminase and the appearance of a cationic transaminase isozyme that apparently resides in the mitochondrial fraction of reticulocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2075902525,Cotton embryos after 72 hours of germination synthesize ribosomal RNA that does not become incorporated into ribosomes and that is very stable. This RNA has many characteristics similar to those of newly synthesized ribosomal RNA of bacteria.
https://openalex.org/W2031732068,Replicas of the etched surfaces of the brachial valves of Gryphus stearnsi (Dall and Pilsbry) and Pictothyris picta (Dillwyn) were examined by electron microscopy. This method clearly reveals the crystalline texture of two of the morphologic layers of the shells and demonstrates that the calcite crystals accommodate the tubular punctate structures. These findings may be useful in resolving some of the problems of brachiopod taxonomy.

https://openalex.org/W2083434100,Utmost caution should be exercised in interpreting archeological data out of context. Certain artifacts described in the literature on human paleopathology as therapeutic corsets are in fact hoods for cradleboards. Close cooperation among specialists in various disciplines is desirable in reconstructing aspects of prehistoric culture.
