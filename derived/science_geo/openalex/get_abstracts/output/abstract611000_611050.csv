https://openalex.org/W2804235153,"A very basic pathway from CO 2 to ethylene Ethylene is an important commodity chemical for plastics. It is considered a tractable target for synthesizing renewably from carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). The challenge is that the performance of the copper electrocatalysts used for this conversion under the required basic reaction conditions suffers from the competing reaction of CO 2 with the base to form bicarbonate. Dinh et al. designed an electrode that tolerates the base by optimizing CO 2 diffusion to the catalytic sites (see the Perspective by Ager and Lapkin). This catalyst design delivers 70% efficiency for 150 hours. Science , this issue p. 783 ; see also p. 707"

A challenge for developing efficient thermoelectric materials is to ensure high electrical but low thermal conductivity. Chang et al. found that bromine doping of tin selenide (SnSe) does just this by maintaining low thermal conductivity in the out-of-plane direction of this layered material. The result is a promising n-type thermoelectric material with electrons as the charge carriers—an important step for developing thermoelectric devices from SnSe. Science , this issue p. 778"

Cai et al. show that the small mustard plant Arabidopsis shuttles defensive sRNAs into the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea via extracellular vesicles (see the Perspective by Thomma and Cook). The vesicles are associated with tetraspanin proteins, which can interact and form membrane microdomains. Several dozen different sRNAs targeting the pathogenic process were transported from Arabidopsis to B. cinerea in a selective manner. Science , this issue p. 1126 ; see also p. 1070"

Although the percentage of land included in the global protected area network has increased from 9 to 15%, Jones et al. found that a third of this area is influenced by intensive human activity. Thus, even landscapes that are protected are experiencing some human pressure, with only the most remote northern regions remaining almost untouched. Science , this issue p. 788"

We have little information about their fate in a changing climate; data are scant for insects compared with other groups of organisms. Warren et al. performed a global-scale analysis of the effects of climate change on insect distribution (see the Perspective by Midgley). For vertebrates and plants, the number of species losing more than half their geographic range by 2100 is halved when warming is limited to 1.5°C, compared with projected losses at 2°C. But for insects, the number is reduced by two-thirds. Science , this issue p. 791 ; see also p. 714"

These metastases are thought to potentially arise from quiescent disseminated cancer cells, likely present at the time of surgery, which evade elimination by the immune system. Pommier et al. explored how these quiescent cells survive by analyzing mouse models and tissue samples from patients with PDA. They found that disseminated cancer cells do not express a cell surface molecule that triggers killing by T cells. This phenotypic feature is linked to their inability to resolve endoplasmic reticulum stress. When this stress is resolved, the disseminated cells begin proliferating and form metastases.

Chakrabarti et al. expand the macrophage repertoire for mammary gland development (see the Perspective by Kannan and Eaves). Mammary gland stem cells secrete the Notch ligand Dll1 and activate Notch signaling, which promotes survival of adjacent macrophages. This stimulates production of Wnt ligands, which signal back to the mammary gland stem cells. This cross-talk plays an important role in coordinating mammary gland development, tissue homeostasis, and, not least, breast cancer. Science , this issue p. eaan4153 ; see also p. 1401"
https://openalex.org/W2804058466,"Phylogenomic datasets have been successfully used to address questions involving evolutionary relationships, patterns of genome structure, signatures of selection, and gene and genome duplications. However, despite the recent explosion in genomic and transcriptomic data, the utility of these data sources for efficient divergence-time inference remains unexamined. Phylogenomic datasets pose two distinct problems for divergence-time estimation: (i) the volume of data makes inference of the entire dataset intractable, and (ii) the extent of underlying topological and rate heterogeneity across genes makes model mis-specification a real concern. ""Gene shopping"", wherein a phylogenomic dataset is winnowed to a set of genes with desirable properties, represents an alternative approach that holds promise in alleviating these issues. We implemented an approach for phylogenomic datasets (available in SortaDate) that filters genes by three criteria: (i) clock-likeness, (ii) reasonable tree length (i.e., discernible information content), and (iii) least topological conflict with a focal species tree (presumed to have already been inferred). Such a winnowing procedure ensures that errors associated with model (both clock and topology) mis-specification are minimized, therefore reducing error in divergence-time estimation. We demonstrated the efficacy of this approach through simulation and applied it to published animal (Aves, Diplopoda, and Hymenoptera) and plant (carnivorous Caryophyllales, broad Caryophyllales, and Vitales) phylogenomic datasets. By quantifying rate heterogeneity across both genes and lineages we found that every empirical dataset examined included genes with clock-like, or nearly clock-like, behavior. Moreover, many datasets had genes that were clock-like, exhibited reasonable evolutionary rates, and were mostly compatible with the species tree. We identified overlap in age estimates when analyzing these filtered genes under strict clock and uncorrelated lognormal (UCLN) models. However, this overlap was often due to imprecise estimates from the UCLN model. We find that ""gene shopping"" can be an efficient approach to divergence-time inference for phylogenomic datasets that may otherwise be characterized by extensive gene tree heterogeneity."

Given the supralinear input/output functions of cortical neurons, increased stimulus drive strengthens effective network connectivity. This shifts the balance from interactions that amplify variability to suppressive inhibitory feedback, quenching correlated variability around more strongly driven steady states.

Variability modulation shows stereotypical patterns. First, the onset of a stimulus quenches variability overall and, in particular, correlated variability in firing rates that is “shared” across many neurons (Lin et al., 2015Lin I.-C. Okun M.

Moreover, the degree of variability reduction can depend systematically on the tuning of individual cells. For example, in area MT, variability is quenched more strongly in cells that respond best to the stimulus, and correlations decrease more among neurons with similar stimulus preferences (Ponce-Alvarez et al., 2013Ponce-Alvarez A. Thiele A. Albright T.D. Stoner G.R. Deco G. Stimulus-dependent variability and noise correlations in cortical MT neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Direction tuning of response variability in populations of MT neurons is different in awake versus anesthetized recordings.in: 2015 Neuroscience Meeting Planner (online). Society for Neuroscience, Washington, DC2015Google Scholar). Although these patterned modulations of variability are increasingly included in quantitative analyses of neural recordings (Renart and Machens, 2014Renart A. Machens C.K.

There have been two dynamical mechanisms proposed to explain selected aspects of the modulation of cortical variability by stimuli. In “multi-attractor” models, the network operates in a multi-stable regime in the absence of a stimulus, such that it noisily wanders among multiple possible stable states (“attractors”). This wandering among attractors occurs in a concerted way across the population, resulting in substantial shared variability (Figure 1A, top). Stimuli then suppress this shared variability by pinning fluctuations to the vicinity of one particular attractor (Figure 1A, bottom; Blumenfeld et al., 2006Blumenfeld B. Bibitchkov D. Tsodyks M.

In chaotic network models (Sompolinsky et al., 1988Sompolinsky H. Crisanti A. Sommers H.J. Chaos in random neural networks.Phys. Rev. Lett. 1988; 61: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), firing rates exhibit strong chaotic fluctuations, and certain types of stimuli can suppress chaos by forcing the dynamical state of the network to follow a specific trajectory, thus quenching across-trial variability (Figure 1B; Molgedey et al., 1992Molgedey L.

Soft Matter Phys. 2010; 82: 011903Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). While both the multi-attractor and the chaotic mechanisms can explain the general phenomenon of stimulus-induced reduction of variability, only the former has been proposed to explain the stimulus-tuning of variability reduction. However, even in that case, a considerable fine-tuning of parameters or very strong noise was needed to keep the network in the regime with multiple attractors, such that the system stays near attractors, yet noise can move the system between them (Ponce-Alvarez et al., 2013Ponce-Alvarez A. Thiele A. Albright T.D. Stoner G.R. Deco G. Stimulus-dependent variability and noise correlations in cortical MT neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 13162-13167Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here, we explore a qualitatively different regime of cortical dynamics. We describe activity fluctuations as being driven by noise but shaped by nonlinear, recurrent interactions. In contrast to previous models, our network operates around a single stable point that depends on the stimulus (Figure 1C). Crucially, individual neurons have supralinear (expansive) input/output functions. This causes the gains of neurons, and thus the effective synaptic strengths in the network, to increase with network activation. This is a stochastic generalization of the stabilized supralinear network (SSN) model that has successfully accounted for a range of phenomena related to the stimulus dependence of trial-averaged responses in visual cortex (Ahmadian et al., 2013Ahmadian Y.

Miller K.D. The stabilized supralinear network: a unifying circuit motif underlying multi-input integration in sensory cortex.Neuron. 2015; 85: 402-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Introducing stochasticity allows us to model the variability of responses and thus use data on neural variability to identify hallmarks of this regime and distinguish it from previous proposals. In our network, stimulus-dependent changes in effective connectivity shape the magnitude and structure of activity fluctuations in the network. Specifically, stimuli change the balance of two opposing effects of recurrent network dynamics on variability: hidden feedforward interactions (“balanced amplification”; Murphy and Miller, 2009Murphy B.K.

Decorrelation of neural-network activity by inhibitory feedback.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8: e1002596Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and dominates for stronger inputs. By studying this network mechanism in a progression of recurrent architectures with increasingly detailed structure, we find that it naturally and robustly explains the modulation of shared cortical variability by stimuli, including its tuning dependence. We first analyze variability in the simplest instantiation of the model, with two unstructured populations of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) cells, and find that an external stimulus can strongly modulate the variability of population activities. In particular, the model predicts stimulus-induced quenching of variability, as well as a reduction of the low-temporal-frequency coherence between local population activity and single-cell responses, as found experimentally (Poulet and Petersen, 2008Poulet J.F.A.

Next, we extend our analysis to a more detailed architecture with structured connectivity to account for the tuning-dependent modulations of Fano factors and noise correlations by stimuli. Critically, these results reveal robust qualitative differences between the predictions of our model and those of previously proposed network mechanisms, based on multi-attractor or chaotic dynamics, for both the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of variability suppression. We tested these predictions against experimental data and found the SSN model to be the most consistent with previously analyzed data from primary visual cortex (V1) and MT (Churchland et al., 2010Churchland M.M.

Stimulus-dependent variability and noise correlations in cortical MT neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Keliris G.A. Bethge M. Logothetis N.K. Tolias A.S. Decorrelated neuronal firing in cortical microcircuits.Science. 2010; 327: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Such comparisons of different models are crucial for guiding future experiments that can make targeted measurements to fully resolve the dynamical regime in which the cortex operates—a key first step in identifying the computational strategies underlying perception. We used a standard model to study the dynamical evolution of momentary firing rates in a recurrently coupled network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons (Figure 2A; Dayan and Abbott, 2001Dayan P. Abbott L.F. Theoretical neuroscience. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2001Google Scholar; see also STAR Methods). In this model, neurons integrate their external and recurrent inputs linearly in their membrane potentials, Vm, but their output firing rates, r, are a nonlinear function of the voltage: r=f(Vm) (Figure 2B). Crucially, we studied variants of this model in which the nonlinearity f is an expansive (supralinear) function (Figure 2B) and in which inhibition was both sufficiently fast and strong and appropriately structured to stabilize the network in the face of recurrent excitation and the supralinear input/output function. This is the stabilized supralinear network (SSN) model (Ahmadian et al., 2013Ahmadian Y. Rubin D.B. Miller K.D. Analysis of the stabilized supralinear network.Neural Comput. 2013; 25: 1994-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In order to study response variability, we added to this model a stochastic component (slow noise) in the membrane potential dynamics of all cells. Stabilization meant that the network operated around a single steady state, albeit a stimulus-dependent one. Real neurons, of course, have an input/output function that ultimately saturates. We focus on an expansive, non-saturating input/output function because V1 cortical neurons show such a relationship between mean voltage and firing rate across their full dynamic range, without saturation even for the strongest visual stimuli (Priebe and Ferster, 2008Priebe N.J. Ferster D. Inhibition, spike threshold, and stimulus selectivity in primary visual cortex.Neuron. 2008; 57: 482-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Thus, saturation does not appear to play a role in stabilizing cortical activity, a fact that we capture by using a non-saturating input/output function. Such an expansive input/output function arises in spiking neurons when their firing is driven by voltage fluctuations, with the mean voltage sub- or peri-threshold (Hansel and van Vreeswijk, 2002Hansel D. van Vreeswijk C.

Neural noise can explain expansive, power-law nonlinearities in neural response functions.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), a firing regime that produces the highly variable spiking seen in cortical neurons (Troyer and Miller, 1997Troyer T.W.

Brunel N. Dynamics of a recurrent network of spiking neurons before and following learning.Network: Computation in Neural Systems. 1997; 8: 373-404Crossref Google Scholar). We assume that the voltage fluctuations giving rise to the expansive input/output function are fast compared to the timescales of variability studied here and do not explicitly model them. We focused on analyzing how the intrinsic dynamics of the network shaped fixed input noise to give rise to stimulus-dependent patterns of response variability. We studied a progression of connectivity architectures of increasing complexity, all involving two separate populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We also validated our results in large-scale simulations of spiking neuronal networks. We first considered a simple circuit motif: an excitatory (E) unit and an inhibitory (I) unit, recurrently coupled and receiving the same mean external input h as well as their own independent noise (Figure 2A). In this reduced model, the two units represent two randomly connected populations of E and I neurons, a canonical model of cortical networks (Amit and Brunel, 1997Amit D.J. Brunel N. Dynamics of a recurrent network of spiking neurons before and following learning.Network: Computation in Neural Systems. 1997; 8: 373-404Crossref Google Scholar, Vogels et al., 2005Vogels T.P. Rajan K. Abbott L.F. Neural network dynamics.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Thus, their time-varying activity, VE(t) and VI(t), represents the momentary population-average membrane potential of all the E and I cells, respectively. Despite its simplicity, this architecture accounted well for the overall population response properties in the larger networks, with more detailed connectivity patterns, that we analyzed later. Activity in the network exhibited temporal variability due to the stochastic component of the dynamics. We found that this (correlated) variability of VE and VI fluctuations, together with their means, V¯E/I, was strongly modulated by the external steady input h (Figures 2C and 2D). When h=0, there was no input to drive the network, and VE and VI both hovered around Vrest=−70 mV, fluctuating virtually independently, with standard deviations essentially matching those that would arise without recurrent connections (gray line in Figure 2D, bottom). For a somewhat larger input, h=2 mV, both E and I populations fired at moderate rates (3–4 Hz) (Figure 2D, top), but now also exhibited large and synchronous population Vm fluctuations (Figure 2C, black circle mark). For yet larger inputs (h=15 mV), fluctuations remained highly correlated, but their magnitude was strongly quenched (Figure 2C, green circle mark). Figure 2D shows how the temporal (or, equivalently, the across-trial) mean and variability of activities varied over a broad range of input strengths. We observed that population mean Vm increased monotonically with growing external input, first linearly or supralinearly for small inputs, but strongly sublinearly for larger inputs, with V¯I growing faster than V¯E (Figure 2D, middle; Ahmadian et al., 2013Ahmadian Y.

Miller K.D. The stabilized supralinear network: a unifying circuit motif underlying multi-input integration in sensory cortex.Neuron. 2015; 85: 402-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, variability in both VE and VI typically increased for small inputs, peaking around this transition between supralinear and sublinear growth, and then decreased with increasing input (Figure 2D, bottom). Importantly, input modulation of variability required recurrent network interactions. This was revealed by comparing our network to a purely feedforward circuit that exhibited qualitatively different behavior (Figure 2D, gray). In the feedforward circuit, mean Vm remained linear in h, so that mean rates rose quadratically with Vm or h (reflecting the input/output nonlinearity; Figure 2B), and fluctuations in Vm no longer depended on the input strength. In order to demonstrate that the overall dynamical regime of the stabilized supralinear network, rather than just a particular instantiation of our model, underlies variability modulation, we used a combination of numerical simulations and analytical results to confirm the robustness of our findings. We simulated 1,000 model networks with random parameter values within wide brackets. We found that variability suppression was robust over a broad range of network parameters (connection weights, input strengths and correlations, and the exponent and scale of the firing-rate nonlinearity), as long as they ensured dynamical stability even for strong inputs (Figures S1 and S2). Although the precise amplitude and position of the peak of Vm variance depended on network parameters, the overall non-monotonic shape of variability modulation was largely conserved. In particular, we could show analytically that variability suppression occurs earlier (for smaller input h) in networks with strong connections or, for fixed overall connection strength, in networks that are more dominated by feedback inhibition (Methods S3). More generally, we found that the firing rates at the peak of variability are typically low (2.5 Hz on average over a thousand randomly parameterized stable networks and below 6 Hz for 90% of them; cf. Methods S2). As these rates are comparable to cortical spontaneous firing rates, this predicts that increased sensory drive should generally result in variability quenching in cortical LFPs. In order to better understand the robustness of variability suppression in the model, we took advantage of the fact that our network was characterized by a single attractor at each level of the input, h, and analyzed the dynamics of small activity fluctuations, δV, around this stable state (such"

In Drosophila, a conserved atx2 gene is essential for animal survival as well as for normal RNP-granule assembly, translational control, and long-term habituation. Like its human homolog, Drosophila Ataxin-2 (Atx2) contains polyQ repeats and additional intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). We demonstrate that Atx2 IDRs, which are capable of mediating liquid-liquid phase transitions in vitro, are essential for efficient formation of neuronal mRNP assemblies in vivo. Remarkably, ΔIDR mutants that lack neuronal RNP granules show normal animal development, survival, and fertility. However, they show defects in long-term memory formation/consolidation as well as in C9ORF72 dipeptide repeat or FUS-induced neurodegeneration. Together, our findings demonstrate (1) that higher-order mRNP assemblies contribute to long-term neuronal plasticity and memory, and (2) that a targeted reduction in RNP-granule formation efficiency can alleviate specific forms of neurodegeneration."

Although NSCLC cell proliferation induced by C5a has been reported, the involved mechanism has not been elucidated. In this study, we examined the proliferation-related genes (i.e., KLF5, GCN5, and GDF15) and C5a receptor (C5aR) expression in tumor tissues as well as C5a concentration in plasma of NSCLC patients, and then determined the roles of KLF5, GCN5, and GDF15 in C5a-triggered NSCLC cell proliferation and the related mechanism both in vitro and in vivo. Our results found that the expression of KLF5, GCN5, GDF15, C5aR, and C5a was significantly upregulated in NSCLC patients. Mechanistic exploration in vitro revealed that C5a could facilitate A549 cell proliferation through increasing KLF5, GCN5, and GDF15 expression. Besides, KLF5 and GCN5 could form a complex, binding to GDF15 promoter in a KLF5-dependent manner and leading to GDF15 gene transcription. More importantly, GCN5-mediated KLF5 acetylation contributing to GDF15 gene transcription and cell proliferation upon C5a stimulation, the region (-103 to +58 nt) of GDF15 promoter which KLF5 could bind to, and two new KLF5 lysine sites (K335 and K391) acetylated by GCN5 were identified for the first time. Furthermore, our experiment in vivo demonstrated that the growth of xenograft tumors in BALB/c nude mice was greatly suppressed by the silence of KLF5, GCN5, or GDF15. Collectively, these findings disclose that C5a-driven KLF5-GCN5-GDF15 axis had a critical role in NSCLC proliferation and might serve as targets for NSCLC therapy."

Its role in renal epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains unknown. In this study, we found that EZH2 and H3K27me3 were highly expressed in mouse kidney with unilateral ureteral obstruction and cultured mouse kidney proximal tubular (TKPT) cells undergoing EMT. Inhibition of EZH2 with 3-deazaneplanocin A (3-DZNeP) attenuated renal fibrosis, which was associated with preserving E-cadherin expression and inhibiting Vimentin up-regulation in the obstructed kidney. Treatment with 3-DZNeP or transfection of EZH2 siRNA also inhibited TGF-β1-induced EMT of TKPT cells. Injury to the kidney or cultured TKPT cells resulted in up-regulation of Snail-l family transcriptional repressor (Snail)-1 and Twist family basic helix-loop-helix (BHLH) transcription factor (Twist)-1, which are 2 transcription factors, and down-regulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog, a protein tyrosine phosphatase associated with inhibition of PI3K-protein kinase B (AKT) signaling; EZH2 inhibition or silencing reversed all those responses. 3-DZNeP was also effective in suppressing epithelial arrest at the G2/M phase and dephosphorylating AKT and β-catenin in vivo and in vitro.

Recent research has indicated that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a DNA base derived from 5-methylcytosine (5mC) via oxidation by ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, is involved in DNA methylation-related plasticity. Here, we report that TET2 expression and 5hmC abundance are significantly altered in the placentas from preeclampsia patients. shRNA-mediated TET2 knockdown (shTET2) reduced trophoblast migration and invasion when cultured in Matrigel. Both real-time PCR of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-related transcripts and a human angiogenesis antibody array indicated that TET2 knockdown in trophoblasts inhibits the expression of MMP transcript, of which MMP9 represented one of the most significant TET2 downstream targets. Using an established shTET2 HTR-8/SVneo cell model, we further confirmed alterations of 5hmC levels and MMP9 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. In particular, we found that TET2 bound to and removed 5mC modifications at the MMP9 promoter region. Interestingly, in TET2 knockdown cells, both MMP9 expression and the compromised trophoblast phenotype could be rescued by vitamin C, an activator of TET enzyme activity. Finally, TET2 expression correlated with MMP9 levels in placenta samples from the preeclampsia patients, indicating that TET2 deregulation is critically involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia through down-regulation of MMP9 expression. Our findings highlight a critical role of TET2 in regulating trophoblast cell migration through demethylation at the MMP9 promoter, and suggest that down-regulation of the TET2-MMP9-mediated pathway contributes to preeclampsia pathogenesis."

It is associated with the bacterium “Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus” (CLas) and is vectored by the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP). Currently, diagnosis of CLas in regulatory samples is based on real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using 16S rRNA gene specific primers/probe. The detection of CLas using qPCR is challenging due to low pathogen titer and uneven distribution in infected plants and exacerbated by sampling issues and presence of inhibitors. This study evaluated a duplex droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) using multi-copy gene targets, 16S and RNR, to simultaneously detect CLas DNA targets in the same sample for unambiguous detection of the HLB pathogen in DNA extracts from citrus leaves and ACP. Standard curve analyses on tenfold dilution series with plasmid, citrus leaf and ACP DNA showed that both ddPCR and qPCR exhibited good linearity and efficiency in the duplex assay. CLas-infected low titer samples were used to validate the duplex ddPCR and qPCR performance and demonstrated that detection rate is higher when both 16S and RNR primers were used in duplex assay. However, the receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that area under the curve for RNR primer was significantly broader, compared to 16S primers for CLas detection at low target titer. The absolute quantification of CLas at variable titers was reproducible and repeatable for both primer sets and the ddPCR showed higher resilience to PCR inhibitors with citrus leaf and ACP extracts. Hence, the resultant duplex ddPCR assay resulted in a significantly improved detection platform for diagnosis of CLas in samples with low pathogen titer."

However, whether lncRNAs contribute to the upregulation of v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (Ets-1), an established oncogenic protein facilitating tumor invasion and metastasis, in gastric cancer remains elusive. Herein, we identified Ets-1 promoter-associated noncoding RNA (pancEts-1) as a novel lncRNA associated with the gastric cancer progression via mining of publicly available datasets and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, in vitro binding, and RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated the binding of pancEts-1 to non-POU domain containing octamer binding (NONO) protein. Mechanistically, pancEts-1 facilitated the physical interaction between NONO and Ets related gene (ERG), resulting in increased ERG transactivation and transcription of Ets-1 associated with gastric cancer progression. In addition, pancEts-1 facilitated the growth and aggressiveness of gastric cancer cells via interacting with NONO. In gastric cancer tissues, pancEts-1, NONO, and ERG were upregulated and significantly correlated with Ets-1 levels. High levels of pancEts-1, NONO, ERG, or Ets-1 were respectively associated with poor survival of gastric cancer patients, whereas simultaneous expression of all of them (HR = 3.012, P = 0.105) was not an independent prognostic factor for predicting clinical outcome.

Growth factor stimulation leads to Akt phosphorylation at two regulatory sites (Thr-308 and Ser-473), acutely activating Akt signaling. Delineating the exact role of each regulatory site is, however, technically challenging and has remained elusive. Here, we used genetic code expansion to produce site-specifically phosphorylated Akt1 to dissect the contribution of each regulatory site to Akt1 activity. We achieved recombinant production of full-length Akt1 containing site-specific pThr and pSer residues for the first time. Our analysis of Akt1 site-specifically phosphorylated at either or both sites revealed that phosphorylation at both sites increases the apparent catalytic rate 1500-fold relative to unphosphorylated Akt1, an increase attributable primarily to phosphorylation at Thr-308. Live imaging of COS-7 cells confirmed that phosphorylation of Thr-308, but not Ser-473, is required for cellular activation of Akt. We found in vitro and in the cell that pThr-308 function cannot be mimicked with acidic residues, nor could unphosphorylated Thr-308 be mimicked by an Ala mutation. An Akt1 variant with pSer-308 achieved only partial enzymatic and cellular signaling activity, revealing a critical interaction between the γ-methyl group of pThr-308 and Cys-310 in the Akt1 active site. Thus, pThr-308 is necessary and sufficient to stimulate Akt signaling in cells, and the common use of phosphomimetics is not appropriate for studying the biology of Akt signaling. Our data also indicate that pThr-308 should be regarded as the primary diagnostic marker of Akt activity."

The potential consequences of land abandonment are the decrease in species diversity and environmental alterations. The issue of land-use induced changes in plant species composition and soil physico-chemical parameters have been rarely studied in species-rich intermittently wet grasslands. In this study we attempt to i) to identify determinants of plant species composition patterns and ii) to investigate the effect of cessation of mowing on vegetation composition and soil properties. The study was conducted in an area of 36 ha covered with Molinion meadows, comprising of mown sites and sites that were left unmown for 10 years. In total, 120 and 80 vegetation plots were sampled from mown and unmown sites, respectively. In these plots we measured plant community composition and soil physico-chemical parameters. The results have shown that the two groups of variables (soil properties and management) differ considerably in their ability to explain variation in plant species data. Soil variables explained four-fold more variation in plant species composition than management did. The content of soil organic matter, moisture, total nitrogen and exchangeable forms of potassium, calcium and magnesium were significantly higher in mown than in unmown grassland systems. The results revealed that soil organic matter was the component of the soil most strongly affected by management, followed by moisture, magnesium, calcium and potassium in that order. Each of these soil parameters was negatively correlated with the abundances of woody plants and invasive species. We concluded that low-intensity, late time of mowing is suitable grassland management practice to ensure high plant species diversity and sustainability of the grassland ecological system while cessation of mowing not only lead to reduced plant species richness and diversity, but also to reduced nutrient levels in grassland soils."

In primary adipocytes, insulin-stimulated GSV mobilization can cause a 20–30-fold increase in cell-surface GLUT4 and glucose uptake. How GSVs are regulated by insulin is not well-understood.

Identified initially in a genetic screen, TUG was proposed to act specifically on GSVs and not at other sites of GLUT4 trafficking.

In muscle, the mobilization of TUG-bound vesicles results in IRAP translocation, so that glucose uptake is coordinated with inactivation of vasopressin, an IRAP substrate (11Habtemichael E.N.

TUG itself is a target of SIRT2-mediated deacetylation, which controls the size of the GSV pool and, consequently, insulin sensitivity (12Belman J.P. Bian R.R. Habtemichael E.N. Li D.T. Jurczak M.J.

Thus, the TUG protein is a critical regulator of GSV accumulation and release and is a major site of insulin action. To mobilize GSVs, insulin stimulates TUG cleavage. Intact TUG links GSVs to the Golgi matrix by binding GLUT4 and IRAP through its N terminus and Golgin-160 and other matrix proteins through its C terminus (7Yu C. Cresswell J. Löffler M.G. Bogan J.S.

Insulin-triggered TUG cleavage separates these N- and C-terminal regions and is required for highly insulin-responsive GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake (12Belman J.P. Bian R.R.

Like the formation of an insulin-responsive pool of GSVs, TUG cleavage occurs in fat and muscle cells but is not observed in other cell types. Insulin-stimulated proteolytic processing of intact TUG produces a novel ubiquitin-like protein modifier, TUGUL (for TUG Ubiquitin-Like), but the major target of TUGUL modification (“tugulation”) has not been identified (13Bogan J.S. Rubin B.R. Yu C. Löffler M.G. Orme C.M. Belman J.P. McNally L.J. Hao M. Cresswell J.A. Endoproteolytic cleavage of TUG protein regulates GLUT4 glucose transporter translocation.J. Biol.

The TUG proteolytic pathway is thought to act in parallel to insulin signals transduced through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, AS160/Tbc1D4, and target Rab proteins, which coordinate overall GLUT4 trafficking (9Belman J.P. Habtemichael E.N. Bogan J.S. A proteolytic pathway that controls glucose uptake in fat and muscle.Rev. Endocr. Metab.

It is not known whether attenuated TUG signaling may contribute to insulin resistance, independently of Akt (16Czech M.P. Insulin action and resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes.Nat. Med. 2017; 23 (28697184): 804-81410.1038/nm.4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). More broadly, how these insulin signaling and vesicle trafficking processes intersect remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we present data to support a model in which the TUG protease is Usp25m, and TUGUL modifies KIF5B (KIF5B, kinesin family member 5B) to load GSVs onto these kinesin motors. Previous results support the idea that intact TUG undergoes proteolytic processing, as diagrammed in Fig. 1A, to produce a ubiquitin-like modifier, TUGUL (13Bogan J.S. Rubin B.R. Yu C. Löffler M.G. Orme C.M. Belman J.P. McNally L.J. Hao M. Cresswell J.A. Endoproteolytic cleavage of TUG protein regulates GLUT4 glucose transporter translocation.J. Biol.

Therefore, we considered that a deubiquitylating enzyme family member may act as the TUG protease. Among these enzymes, Usp25 (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 25) was of particular interest because it was identified in a screen for proteins that bind tankyrase, an IRAP partner that regulates GLUT4 trafficking (17Sbodio J.I.

In addition, Usp25 is present in distinct splice variants, including a muscle isoform that might account, at least in part, for the cell-type specificity of TUG cleavage in myocytes and adipocytes (22Denuc A. Bosch-Comas A. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Marfany G. The UBA-UIM domains of the USP25 regulate the enzyme ubiquitination state and modulate substrate recognition.PLoS One. 2009; 4 (19440361)e557110.1371/journal.pone.0005571Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Valero R.

Characterization of alternatively spliced products and tissue-specific isoforms of USP28 and USP25.Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (11597335)RESEARCH0043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This muscle isoform, Usp25m, has additional exons encoding 70 residues not present in the ubiquitous isoform, Usp25a, so that it has a greater relative mass (24Bosch-Comas A. Lindsten K. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Masucci M.G. Marfany G. The ubiquitin-specific protease USP25 interacts with three sarcomeric proteins.Cell. Mol.

These residues are internal, and how they contribute to the structure and function of Usp25m is not understood. To learn whether a Usp25 protein is present in adipocytes, we used 3T3-L1 cells. These cells can be induced to undergo adipose tissue differentiation over the course of 8 days, and they are widely used for studies of GLUT4 translocation. As shown in Fig. 1B, immunoblots revealed that a Usp25 protein is induced early during adipocyte differentiation, so that its abundance is maximal by day 4. Data below indicate that this is the Usp25m isoform. Usp25m up-regulation coincided with the appearance of TUG cleavage products, which are present at 42 and 54 kDa (for the C-terminal product) and 130 kDa (for the N-terminal product, containing TUGUL attached to its major target protein), as described previously (13Bogan J.S. Rubin B.R. Yu C. Löffler M.G. Orme C.M. Belman J.P. McNally L.J. Hao M. Cresswell J.A. Endoproteolytic cleavage of TUG protein regulates GLUT4 glucose transporter translocation.J. Biol.

To characterize what splice form of Usp25 is expressed in adipose tissue, we immunoblotted lysates prepared from mouse gonadal white adipose tissue (GWAT), quadriceps, other hindlimb muscles, and brain. As shown in Fig. 1C, the Usp25 protein in adipose tissue was observed at the same molecular mass as the Usp25m isoform present in skeletal muscles (predicted to be 130 kDa) and was clearly distinct from the smaller Usp25a isoform present in brain (predicted to be 122 kDa). These data support the idea that Usp25m is expressed in adipose, as well as in muscle cells. Possibly, Usp25m may function in GLUT4 regulation in both cell types. Here, we focus on its role in adipocytes. To determine whether Usp25m interacts with TUG, we first performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using transfected cells. Fig. 1D shows that TUG can be copurified with Usp25m, but substantially less well with Usp25a, when these proteins are coexpressed. On dark exposures of films from this experiment, we observed the TUG 42-kDa C-terminal cleavage product in lysates of cells transfected with Usp25m, but not Usp25a, as explored further below. To examine whether the endogenous Usp25m protein in 3T3-L1 adipocytes associates with TUG, we used a TUG protein containing a C-terminal biotin tag, as described previously (11Habtemichael E.N. Alcázar-Román A. Rubin B.R. Grossi L.R. Belman J.P. Julca O. Löffler M.G. Li H. Chi N.W. Samuel V.T. Bogan J.S. Coordinated regulation of vasopressin inactivation and glucose uptake by action of TUG protein in muscle.J. Biol.

This protein is expressed using a retrovirus and is present at only slightly increased abundance compared with endogenous TUG protein in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We purified TUG-bound vesicles from cell homogenates by incubation with immobilized streptavidin and analyzed the eluted proteins on immunoblots. Fig. 1E shows that Usp25m was copurified with TUG and that insulin stimulated its dissociation from TUG isolated using the C-terminal tag. Similar results were obtained for GLUT4, IRAP, VAMP2, LRP1, and VAMP3, which are all present in GSVs (25Jedrychowski M.P. Gartner C.A. Gygi S.P. Zhou L. Herz J. Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Proteomic analysis of GLUT4 storage vesicles reveals LRP1 to be an important vesicle component and target of insulin signaling.J. Biol.

Because the purification was done using immobilized streptavidin, we immunoblotted an endogenous biotinylated protein, acetyl-CoA-carboxylase, as a control. As predicted, the purification of this protein was unaffected by brief insulin stimulation. Previous data imply that AS160/TbC1D4, an Akt substrate through which insulin activates specific Rab GTPases, is also present on GSVs (26Larance M. Ramm G. Stöckli J. van Dam E.M. Winata S. Wasinger V. Simpson F. Graham M. Junutula J.R. Guilhaus M. James D.E. Characterization of the role of the Rab GTPase-activating protein AS160 in insulin-regulated GLUT4 trafficking.J. Biol.

We therefore repeated the experiment shown in Fig. 1E and immunoblotted AS160. As shown in Fig. 1F, AS160 was present on TUG-bound vesicles in unstimulated cells, and its abundance was greatly reduced by prior insulin stimulation, similar to results obtained for other GSV proteins. Together, the data support the idea that Usp25m associates with TUG-bound GSVs in unstimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that insulin stimulates the acute mobilization of Usp25m, as well as these vesicles, from the TUG C terminus. We also tested whether Usp25m associates with GLUT4 itself. We used 3T3-L1 adipocytes that stably express a GLUT4 reporter protein, GLUT4–7myc-GFP, described previously (27Bogan J.S. McKee A.E. Lodish H.F. Insulin-responsive compartments containing GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 and CHO cells: regulation by amino acid concentrations.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21 (11416153): 4785-480610.1128/MCB.21.14.4785-4806.2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and prepared lysates using nonionic detergent. As shown in Fig. 1G, endogenous Usp25m coimmunoprecipitated with this GLUT4 protein in unstimulated cells. In repeated experiments, about a third of these complexes were disassembled after insulin stimulation (32 ± 7%, mean ± S.E., p < 0.01, n = 4). Previous data show that two-thirds of intact TUG proteins are similarly released from GLUT4 after insulin stimulation (6Bogan J.S. Hendon N. McKee A.E. Tsao T.S. Lodish H.F.

Together, the data support the idea that Usp25m is expressed in adipocytes and that it interacts with TUG and with insulin-responsive GLUT4. To examine whether Usp25m colocalizes with GSVs, we performed subcellular fractionation experiments. We separated 3T3-L1 adipocytes into cytosol, plasma membrane (PM), light microsome (LM), heavy microsome (HM), and mitochondria/nuclei (M/N) fractions, as described previously (7Yu C. Cresswell J.

In Fig. 2A, immunoblotting confirmed that IRAP is mobilized out of the LM fraction and to the PM after brief insulin stimulation. Usp25m was present in the LM fraction and was not abundant in other fractions in unstimulated cells. Insulin stimulated the mobilization of Usp25m from the LM fraction into the cytosol. These data are consistent with data in Fig. 1, which imply that Usp25m binds GLUT4 and TUG proteins present on GSVs and dissociates from these vesicles after insulin stimulation. In preliminary studies, we observed the 42-kDa TUG C-terminal cleavage product on membranes with characteristics of lipid rafts. We considered that if the product is generated on these membranes, then at least some Usp25m proteins may partition in raft fractions. Accordingly, we used a flotation assay to separate raft and nonraft membranes from basal and insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 2B, rafts containing caveolin were present in fractions 2–7, whereas nonraft membranes were present in fractions 8–12. A subset of the raft fractions contained flotillin. Intact TUG and Usp25m were present in similar distributions spanning raft and nonraft fractions and were slightly redistributed to rafts in insulin-stimulated cells. Whereas the 42-kDa TUG product was observed only in nonraft fractions in unstimulated cells, this product was present in raft fractions of insulin-stimulated cells. The TUG C-terminal antibody detected additional bands at ∼46 and at 25 kDa, which may represent other TUG-derived products. The 54-kDa modified TUG C-terminal product observed previously (13Bogan J.S. Rubin B.R. Yu C. Löffler M.G. Orme C.M. Belman J.P. McNally L.J. Hao M. Cresswell J.A.

Together with other results, the data support the idea that Usp25m activity generates the 42-kDa TUG C-terminal cleavage product on membranes with characteristics of lipid rafts. We also studied whether Usp25m colocalizes with GLUT4 using confocal microscopy of 3T3-L1 adipocytes containing the GFP-tagged GLUT4 reporter protein. We observed intracellular punctae at which Usp25m and GLUT4 colocalized in the basal (unstimulated) state (Fig. 2C). After insulin stimulation, GLUT4 was observed at the plasma membrane, and there seemed to be fewer intracellular punctae containing colocalized Usp25m. We conclude that Usp25m binds and colocalizes with insulin-responsive GSVs and that it dissociates from these membranes after insulin stimulation. We used shRNAs to study whether Usp25m is required for insulin-stimulated TUG proteolysis. We expressed these shRNAs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using retroviruses. Initial testing of five different shRNAs showed that four effectively depleted Usp25m, as shown in Fig. 3A."
https://openalex.org/W2803829633,"Bacteria belonging to the genus Pseudovibrio have been frequently found in association with a wide variety of marine eukaryotic invertebrate hosts, indicative of their versatile and symbiotic lifestyle. A recent comparison of the sponge-associated Pseudovibrio genomes has shed light on the mechanisms influencing a successful symbiotic association with sponges. In contrast, the genomic architecture of Pseudovibrio bacteria associated with other marine hosts has received less attention. Here, we performed genus-wide comparative analyses of 18 Pseudovibrio isolated from sponges, coral, tunicates, flatworm, and seawater. The analyses revealed a certain degree of commonality among the majority of sponge- and coral-associated bacteria. Isolates from other marine invertebrate host, tunicates, exhibited a genetic repertoire for cold adaptation and specific metabolic abilities including mucin degradation in the Antarctic tunicate-associated bacterium Pseudovibrio sp. Tun.PHSC04_5.I4. Reductive genome evolution was simultaneously detected in the flatworm-associated bacteria and the sponge-associated bacterium P. axinellae AD2, through the loss of major secretion systems (type III/VI) and virulence/symbioses factors such as proteins involved in adhesion and attachment to the host. Our study also unraveled the presence of a CRISPR-Cas system in P. stylochi UST20140214-052 a flatworm-associated bacterium possibly suggesting the role of CRISPR-based adaptive immune system against the invading virus particles. Detection of mobile elements and genomic islands (GIs) in all bacterial members highlighted the role of horizontal gene transfer for the acquisition of novel genetic features, likely enhancing the bacterial ecological fitness. These findings are insightful to understand the role of genome diversity in Pseudovibrio as an evolutionary strategy to increase their colonizing success across a wide range of marine eukaryotic hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2803308518,"This study describes differences in species richness and composition of the assemblages of galling insects and their host plants at different spatial scales. Sampling was conducted along altitudinal gradients composed of campos rupestres and campos de altitude of two mountain complexes in southeastern Brazil: Espinhaço Range and Mantiqueira Range. The following hypotheses were tested: i) local and regional richness of host plants and galling insects are positively correlated; ii) beta diversity is the most important component of regional diversity of host plants and galling insects; and iii) Turnover is the main mechanism driving beta diversity of both host plants and galling insects. Local richness of galling insects and host plants increased with increasing regional richness of species, suggesting a pattern of unsaturated communities. The additive partition of regional richness (γ) into local and beta components shows that local richnesses (α) of species of galling insects and host plants are low relative to regional richness; the beta (β) component incorporates most of the regional richness. The multi-scale analysis of additive partitioning showed similar patterns for galling insects and host plants with the local component (α) incorporated a small part of regional richness. Beta diversity of galling insects and host plants were mainly the result of turnover, with little contribution from nesting. Although the species composition of galling insects and host plant species varied among sample sites, mountains and even mountain ranges, local richness remained relatively low. In this way, the addition of local habitats with different landscapes substantially affects regional richness. Each mountain contributes fundamentally to the composition of regional diversity of galling insects and host plants, and so the design of future conservation strategies should incorporate multiple scales."
https://openalex.org/W2804615309,"The increase in cAMP levels in endothelial cells triggers cellular signaling to alter vascular permeability. It is generally considered that cAMP signaling stabilizes the endothelial barrier function and reduces permeability. However, previous studies have only examined the permeability shortly after cAMP elevation and thus have only investigated acute responses. Because cAMP is a key regulator of gene expression, elevated cAMP may have a delayed but profound impact on the endothelial permeability by altering the expression of the genes that are vital for the vessel wall stability. The small guanosine triphosphate hydrolase Ras-related protein (R-Ras) stabilizes VE-cadherin clus tering and enhances endothelial barrier function, thereby stabilizing the integrity of blood vessel wall. Here we show that cAMP controls endothelial permeability through RRAS gene regulation. The prolonged cAMP elevation tran scriptionally repressed RRAS in endothelial cells via a cAMP response element-binding 3 (CREB3)-dependent mechanism and significantly disrupted the adherens junction. These effects resulted in a marked increase of endo thelial permeability that was reversed by R-Ras transduction. Furthermore, cAMP elevation in the endothelium by prostaglandin E2 or phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibition caused plasma leakage from intact microvessels in mouse skin. Our study demonstrated that, contrary to the widely accepted notion, cAMP elevation in endothelial cells ultimately increases vascular permeability, and the cAMP-dependent RRAS repression critically contributes to this effect.—Perrot, C.

Whereas the exact role has not been defined, loss of Yfh1 results in severely compromised Fe-S cluster synthesis and decreased mitochondrial function. Loss of Yfh1, as with mutations in genes in the early steps of mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis, results in increased deposits of insoluble iron, “nanoparticles,” within mitochondria (11Seguin A.

The generation of these nanoparticles results in concomitant oxidant radical formation, leading to loss of mitochondrial DNA.

YFH1 was acting as a high-copy suppressor and was not allelic to the mutation in bm-8. The bm-8 mutant allele was a missense mutation in YMR134W, which encoded for a protein of unknown function. Moretti-Almeida et al. (14Moretti-Almeida G. Netto L.E. Monteiro G. The essential gene YMR134W from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is important for appropriate mitochondrial iron utilization and the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway.FEBS Lett. 2013; 587 (23892078): 3008-301310.1016/j.febslet.2013.07.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) reported that a temperature-sensitive allele of YMR134W showed low mitochondrial iron accumulation at the restrictive temperature along with defects in ergosterol synthesis. Here, we report a detailed description of YMR134W, herein referred to as ERG29. We determined that deletion of ERG29 resulted in lethality in respiring cells, but cells that had lost the ability to respire (Rho− or Rho0) could survive and that ERG29 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that plays a role in sterol synthesis at the methyl sterol oxidase step. We determined that in the absence of ERG29, methyl sterol metabolites accumulate and result in a decreased ability of mitochondria to synthesize Fe-S clusters. We further show that decreased Fe-S cluster synthesis is due to a dramatic reduction in Yfh1. The effects of ERG29 loss can be exacerbated by increased mitochondrial iron import or decreased by overexpression of mitochondrial iron exporter gene MMT1 or MMT2 or by overexpression of YFH1 or PET20, a nuclear gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein involved in protecting mitochondria from oxidant damage (15Polevoda B.

In a complex set of reactions, Erg25 along with two other enzymes (Erg26 and Erg27) catalyzes the demethylation of 4,4-dimethylzymosterol (4,4-DMZ) to zymosterol. Preliminary studies showed that when cells with a missense mutation in YMR134W/ERG29 were placed on low iron, they had an altered sterol pattern, similar to that seen in mutants in ERG25 (data not shown). This finding led us to examine the effects of deletion of ERG29. Previous studies showed that ERG29 was lethal in respiring cells (19Snoek I.S. Steensma H.Y. Why does Kluyveromyces lactis not grow under anaerobic conditions? Comparison of essential anaerobic genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the Kluyveromyces lactis genome.FEMS Yeast Res. 2006; 6 (16630279): 393-40310.1111/j.1567-1364.2005.00007.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine the function of Erg29, we generated a ERG29 deletion strain that contained a plasmid expressing carboxyl-terminally His-tagged Erg29 whose expression was under the control of either the β-estradiol promoter (turned on in the presence of β-estradiol, pGEV) or the GAL1 promoter (on in the presence of galactose) (Table 1). This two-plasmid system allows for independent regulation of expression via growth in glucose with the addition of β-estradiol (no carbon source change) or via growth in galactose to permit expression and then shifted to glucose to suppress expression (20Gao C.Y. Pinkham J.L. Tightly regulated, β-estradiol dose-dependent expression system for yeast.BioTechniques. 2000; 29 (11126125): 1226-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This system also allows for tightly regulated β-estradiol–titrated expression from low to extremely high levels. Cells with a deletion in ERG29 grown in β-estradiol were viable (Fig. 1A, middle), whereas the absence of β-estradiol resulted in a severe growth defect (Fig. 1A, right, top left quadrant), which over time led to the generation of small colonies. These small colonies were able to grow but were shown to be respiration-incompetent, as they were unable to grow on YPGE (Fig. 1A, right, top right quadrant compared with left, top right quadrant). We noted growth of Δerg29 pβ-estradiol-ERG29 cells on YPGE without β-estradiol (Fig. 1A, left, top left quadrant). As those cells were unable to grow on YPD (−) β-estradiol (Fig. 1A, right, top left quadrant), we attribute the growth on YPGE to the absence of glucose-mediated repression of the GAL1 promoter in the pGEV system (20Gao C.Y. Pinkham J.L. Tightly regulated, β-estradiol dose-dependent expression system for yeast.BioTechniques. 2000; 29 (11126125): 1226-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We utilized galactose regulation of the Δerg29pβ-estradiolGAL1ERG29 strain to examine the effects of loss of Erg29 on sterol synthesis. Δerg29pGAL1ERG29 cells grown in galactose had some increase in the levels of 4,4-DMZ and 4-methyl fecosterol and decreased levels of ergosterol compared with WT cells; however, in glucose-containing medium, Δerg29pGAL1ERG29 cells showed an increase in intermediate sterols and a corresponding decrease in zymosterol and ergosterol (Fig. 1B). We confirmed that growth in glucose resulted in the loss of Erg29-His protein (Fig. 1C). We note that WT cells grown in glucose accumulated more zymosterol than when grown in galactose. We do not know the reason for this observation. We hypothesize that the altered sterols seen in galactose-grown Δerg29pGAL1ERG29 cells reflect decreased function of the epitope-tagged Erg29. We confirmed this hypothesis by transforming the Δerg29pβ-estradiolGAL1ERG29 strain with a plasmid containing nontagged ERG29 under its endogenous promoter. Sterol analysis revealed lower levels of methyl sterol intermediates and increased zymosterol and ergosterol in cells expressing nontagged Erg29 (Fig. 1D). This supports the hypothesis that the epitope tag reduced the function of Erg29. We also determined that the untagged Erg29 functioned better in complementing the loss of Erg29 (Fig. 1D, + pYcp ERG29 + β-estradiol (hatched gray bar) compared with +β-estradiol alone (gray bar)).Table 1Plasmids used in this studyPlasmidSource/ReferencepGEV(Gal4:EV:VP16)HIS3 from Ref. 20Gao C.Y.

To more closely examine the similarities in sterol profiles, we generated a ERG25 deletion strain expressing a β-estradiol pGAL1ERG25 similar to the “ERG29 shut-off” system. Δerg25pGAL1ERG25 cells grown in galactose had some increase in the levels of 4,4-DMZ and 4-methyl fecosterol and decreased levels of ergosterol compared with WT cells; however, in glucose-containing medium Δerg25pGAL1ERG25 cells showed a dramatic increase in 4,4-DMZ and a corresponding decrease in zymosterol and ergosterol (Fig. 1E). We confirmed that growth in glucose resulted in the loss of Erg25 protein (Fig. 1C). The sterol pattern seen in glucose-grown Δerg25pGAL1ERG25 cells appears similar to that in Δerg29pGAL1ERG29 cells, although we consistently observed higher levels of the methyl sterol intermediates, such as 4-methyl fecosterol (see Fig. 1B) and 4-carboxyzymosterol in Δerg29pGAL1ERG29 cells (data not shown). That the loss of ERG29 affects the methyl sterol oxidase reaction is supported by the observation that overexpression of ERG25, through transformation with a high-copy plasmid permitted Δerg29 cells to survive (Fig. 2A). In contrast, transformation with a high-copy ERG26 plasmid, which encodes the subsequent enzyme in the methyl sterol oxidase reaction (21Gachotte D. Barbuch R. Gaylor J. Nickel E. Bard M. Characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERG26 gene encoding the C-3 sterol dehydrogenase (C-4 decarboxylase) involved in sterol biosynthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Together, the results support the hypothesis that the loss of ERG29 affects the methyl sterol oxidase reaction in which Erg25 is the first enzyme in the reaction. These results suggest that the “shut-off” of ERG29 specifically affects the Erg25 reaction and not another enzyme in the methyl sterol oxidase reaction. Erg25 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (18Li L. Kaplan J. Characterization of yeast methyl sterol oxidase (ERG25) and identification of a human homologue.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (8663358): 16927-1693310.1074/jbc.271.28.16927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We generated a MET3-regulated ERG29-GFP plasmid and transformed it into WT or Δerg29pGAL1ERG29 cells. We confirmed that the carboxyl-tagged Erg29-GFP complemented the loss of ERG29 (Fig. 2B) and confirmed that Erg29-GFP is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2C) similar to that reported in a previous genomic epitope tag study (22Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Global analysis of protein localization in budding yeast.Nature. 2003; 425 (14562095): 686-69110.1038/nature02026Crossref PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar). As described in Fig. 1, loss of respiration can permit Δerg29 cells to survive as Rho0 cells. Based on this result, we examined whether there were changes in the sterol pattern in Rho0 cells. We used ethidium bromide to generate Rho0 WT cells and then deleted ERG29 to generate Δerg29 Rho0 cells. Making cells Rho0 alone did not affect ergosterol synthesis, whereas the loss of ERG29 in Rho0 cells showed diminished ergosterol synthesis and increased intermediate sterols compared with WT Rho0 cells (Fig. 3A); however, the levels of accumulated intermediates were reduced in Δerg29 Rho0 cells compared with Δerg29pGAL1ERG29 grown in glucose (Fig. 1B) or in the absence of β-estradiol (Fig. 1C). Further, the amount of ergosterol synthesized in Δerg29 Rho0 cells was increased compared with Δerg29pGAL1ERG29 grown in glucose or in the absence of β-estradiol. These results suggest that mitochondrial respiration or mitochondrial oxidants affect ergosterol synthesis in the absence of ERG29. To determine whether iron limitation affected sterol synthesis, WT Rho0 and Δerg29 Rho0 cells were grown in medium made iron-limited by the iron chelator bathophenanthroline sulfonate (BPS). Δerg29 Rho0 cells grew poorly (BPS with 0–4 μm iron (BPS(0) to BPS(4)) but equal to WT Rho0 cells with increased iron (BPS(100)) (Fig. 3B). As Δerg29 Rho0 cells grew poorly if grown on iron-limited medium for extended times, we grew WT Rho0 and Δerg29 Rho0 cells in iron-limited medium for 4 h to examine whether limiting iron affected sterol synthesis. Δerg29 Rho0 cells still showed increased intermediate sterols (4,4-DMZ and 4-methyl fecosterol) and reduced zymosterol and ergosterol synthesis compared with WT Rho0 cells (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that short-term growth in iron-limited medium did not affect the altered sterols seen in Δerg29 cells. Δerg29 Rho0 cells were much more sensitive to conditions that affected the methyl sterol oxidase reaction than WT Rho0 cells. Incubation of cells with cobalt has been shown to inhibit the enzyme activity of oxo-diiron–containing Erg25 in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cryptococcus neoformans, leading to a hyperaccumulation of 4,4-DMZ and decreased levels of zymosterol (23Lee H. Bien C.M. Hughes A.L. Espenshade P.J. Kwon-Chung K.J. Chang Y.C. Cobalt chloride, a hypoxia-mimicking agent, targets sterol synthesis in the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans.Mol Microbiol. 2007; 65 (17645443): 1018-103310.1111/j.1365-2958.2007.05844.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The addition of 1.0 mm cobalt to WT Rho0 cells had little effect on viability, whereas Δerg29 Rho0 cells showed a loss of viability (Fig. 3D). Further, we utilized the Erg25 inhibitor 6-amino-2-n-pentylthiobenzothiazole (APB) to assess growth of Δerg29 Rho0 cells. WT Rho0 cells showed some toxicity at 60 μm APB, whereas Δerg29 Rho0 cells showed toxic effects at 20 μm (Fig. 3E). These results support the view that loss of ERG29 increases the sensitivity of Erg25 to agents known to affect the Erg25 reaction. Together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that Erg29 functions in the Erg25 methyl sterol oxidase reaction and that mitochondrial respiration affects ergosterol synthesis. We took a genetic approach to examine the mechanism of toxicity due to loss of ERG29. As loss of ERG29 results in death when cells are grown in respiratory medium, we used a high-copy genomic library (LEU2) to identify suppressors that would permit growth of Δerg29 cells on glycerol-ethanol (GE). We transformed our Δerg29YCpERG29(URA3) strain with a genomic library. We then selected for loss of YCpERG29 on 5-fluoroorotic acid and identified surviving colonies that could grow on GE. As expected, several recovered plasmids that allowed Δerg29 Rho+ cells to grow on GE contained the ERG29 gene (data not shown). In addition, we found MMT2, YFH1, and PET20 as high-copy suppressors. That we did not recover ERG25 as a high-copy suppressor suggests that our screen was not saturated. We confirmed that overexpression of MMT2, YFH1, and PET20 permitted ERG29 shut-off (Δerg29pGAL1ERG29) cells to grow on glucose (Fig. 4A). Babcock et al. (4Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R.

Our results show that YFH1 can also partially suppress the growth defect of Δerg29 cells. MMT2 encodes a mitochondrial iron exporter, which is a member of the family of cation diffusion facilitators (24Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. A novel family of ubiquitous heavy metal ion transport proteins.J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156 (9075641): 99-10310.1007/s002329900192Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 25Li L. Miao R. Jia X.

We did not find MMT1 in our screen, but we confirmed that overexpression of MMT1 would permit Δerg29 cells to grow as Rho+ (Fig. 4A). PET20 is a nuclear gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein, which when deleted leads to increased sensitivity to oxidant stress (15Polevoda B. Panciera Y. Brown S.P. Wei J. Sherman F.

All of the plasmids that permitted growth of Δerg29 cells also affected the Δerg29 sterol pattern (Fig. 4B). Overexpression of these genes did not normalize the sterol pattern of ERG29 shut-off cells"

Little is known about the role of NEDD9 in ovarian carcinoma (OC), but available data suggest elevated mRNA and protein expression in advanced stage high-grade cancers. We used a transgenic MISIIR-TAg mouse OC model combined with genetic ablation of Nedd9 to investigate its action in the development and progression of OC. A Nedd9−/− genotype delayed tumor growth rate, reduced incidence of ascites, and reduced expression and activation of signaling proteins including SRC, STAT3, E-cadherin, and AURKA. Cell lines established from MISIIR-TAg;Nedd9−/− and MISIIR-TAg;Nedd9+/+ mice exhibited altered migration and invasion. Growth of these cells in a syngeneic allograft model indicated that systemic Nedd9 loss in the microenvironment had little impact on tumor allograft growth, but in a Nedd9 wild-type background Nedd9−/− allografts exhibited significantly reduced growth, dissemination, and oncogenic signaling compared to Nedd9+/+ allografts. Gene expression analysis revealed that Nedd9+/+ tumors exhibited more mesenchymal “stem-like” transcriptional program, including increased expression of Aldh1a1 and Aldh1a2. Conversely, loss of Nedd9 resulted in increased expression of differentiation genes, including fallopian tube markers Foxj1, Ovgp1, and Pax8. Collectively, these data suggest that tumor cell-intrinsic Nedd9 expression promotes OC development and progression by broad induction of oncogenic protein signaling and stem/mesenchymal gene expression."

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of prepartum CLA supplementation on lactation performance and serum fatty acids (FA) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in early lactation dairy cows, and secondarily on reproductive performance. Multiparous cows were enrolled in the study at 18 days prior to expected calving date, and randomly assigned 100 g/day of Lutrell Pure (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany; 75% FA), providing 10 g/day of each CLA isomer (trans-10 cis-12 and cis-9 trans-11 CLA) or equivalent amount of rumen inert fatty acids as control (78 g/day of Energy Booster 100; Milk Specialties Global, Eden Prairie, MN). Treatments were top dressed daily to individual cows from enrollment to calving and all cows were offered the same ration. Blood samples were collected on the first day of supplementation, 10 days prepartum, and 1, 7, 14, and 30 days postpartum. Hyperketonemia was defined as serum BHB ≥ 1.2 mM. Milk yield was recorded daily until 60 days postpartum and averaged weekly. Milk samples were obtained weekly for component analysis. Prepartum CLA supplementation tended to increase serum concentration of cis-9, trans-11 CLA and increased trans-10, cis-12 CLA prepartum. Cows supplemented with CLA had increased milk protein yield and tended to have increased milk fat yield and milk yield, which together resulted in greater energy content of milk. Cows supplemented with CLA had lower serum FA on day 1 and 7 postpartum and overall lower serum BHB postpartum, which resulted in decreased prevalence of hyperketonemia on day 14 postpartum. There were no differences in body condition score change, other health disorders, or reproductive outcomes by treatment. Together, these findings indicate that prepartum CLA supplementation may be a plausible strategy to positively influence postpartum performance."

RNA alternative splicing has been implicated in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes. We report here that FOXP3 associates with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) F through the exon 2–encoded region of FOXP3 and the second quasi-RNA recognition motif (qRRM) of hnRNPF. FOXP3 represses the ability of hnRNPF to bind to its target pre-mRNA and thus modulates RNA alternative splicing. Furthermore, overexpression of mouse hnRNPF in in vitro-differentiated regulatory T cells (Tregs) reduced their suppressive function. Thus, our studies identify a novel mechanism by which FOXP3 regulates mRNA alternative splicing to modulate the function of regulatory T cells."

However, the biological significance of a duplication of the PTAP motif for HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis has not been experimentally validated. In a longitudinal study of two different clinical cohorts of select HIV-1 seropositive, drug-naive individuals from India, we found that 8 of 50 of these individuals harbored a mixed infection of viral strains discordant for the PTAP duplication. Conventional and next-generation sequencing of six primary viral quasispecies at multiple time points disclosed that in a mixed infection, the viral strains containing the PTAP duplication dominated the infection. The dominance of the double-PTAP viral strains over a genetically similar single-PTAP viral clone was confirmed in viral proliferation and pairwise competition assays. Of note, in the proximity ligation assay, double-PTAP Gag proteins exhibited a significantly enhanced interaction with the host protein tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101). Moreover, Tsg101 overexpression resulted in a biphasic effect on HIV-1C proliferation, an enhanced effect at low concentration and an inhibitory effect only at higher concentrations, unlike a uniformly inhibitory effect on subtype B strains. In summary, our results indicate that the duplication of the PTAP motif in the p6 Gag protein enhances the replication fitness of HIV-1C by engaging the Tsg101 host protein with a higher affinity.

The sequence duplication in the PTAP domain may be divided into two categories based on whether or not the core PTAP motif (consisting of the four amino acids proline, threonine, alanine, and proline) is fully duplicated. Based on this classification, a large number of sequence insertions in HIV-1B are characterized by only a partial sequence duplication that does not lead to the creation of an additional PTAP motif. In HIV-1B, although a large number of the sequence insertions lead to the duplication of a 3-amino acid stretch “APP” in p6 Gag and “SPT” in p6 Gag-Pol, only a small fraction of the sequence insertions constitute a complete duplication of the PTAP core motif and the flanking residues (43Ibe S.

Several studies attempted to understand the biological significance of the PTAP sequence insertion primarily in the context of HIV-1B. The inferences drawn from the studies are conflicting and nonconclusive. Although some studies reported enhanced viral transmission or increased drug resistance due to PTAP sequence modification, other reports failed to find such advantages. The viral strains containing PTAP duplication transmitted more efficiently from ART-treated mothers to their infants suggesting preferential vertical transmission (44Colgrove R.C. Millet A.

Infectious clones of subtype B containing a 3-amino acid duplication (APP) in the PTAP motif demonstrated reduced processing of p6 (49Tamiya S. Mardy S. Kavlick M.F. Yoshimura K. Mistuya H.

The proposed association between the nature of the amino acid sequence insertion in the PTAP motif and the administration of ART was questioned (43Ibe S. Shibata N. Utsumi M. Kaneda T.

Furthermore, a few studies failed to find a significant difference in the frequency of the PTAP insertion between ART-naive and drug-exposed arms in subtype B (36Holguín A. Alvarez A. Soriano V. Differences in the length of gag proteins among different HIV type 1 subtypes.AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2005; 21 (16225417): 886-89310.1089/aid.2005.21.886Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Collectively, the biological significance of the PTAP motif sequence modification in subtype B, where this phenomenon has been examined extensively, remains nonconclusive. In the backdrop of continued ambiguity surrounding the PTAP sequence modification and the biological significance in HIV-1B, the examination of the phenomenon in HIV-1C could offer a few technical advantages. Importantly, the nature and frequency of PTAP sequence duplication of HIV-1C differ profoundly from that of HIV-1B. Unlike in HIV-1B where the sequence insertions mostly cause only a partial duplication of PTAP, sequence insertions in HIV-1C p6 Gag more commonly lead to complete duplication of the core PTAP motif and the flanking amino acid sequences (50Sharma S. Aralaguppe S.G. Abrahams M.R. Williamson C. Gray C. Balakrishnan P. Saravanan S. Murugavel K.G. Solomon S. Ranga U.

A publication from Brazil examined PTAP duplication in a clinical cohort of drug-naive and drug-experienced arms representing HIV-1 infection of three different subtypes B, C, and F (15Martins A.N.

Retroviruses. 2011; 27 (21083435): 687-69210.1089/aid.2010.0282Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This study identified a remarkably higher frequency of PTAP duplication in subtype C as compared with the other two subtypes in both the arms of the study. An analysis of the Gag sequences from the extant databases showed that unlike in other subtypes of HIV-1, subtype C has a natural propensity to generate the PTAP motif duplication at a significantly higher frequency and of greater length (Fig. 3). Additionally, the global prevalence of PTAP duplication in HIV-1C increased progressively over the past 30 years (50Sharma S. Aralaguppe S.G. Abrahams M.R. Williamson C. Gray C. Balakrishnan P. Saravanan S. Murugavel K.G. Solomon S. Ranga U. The PTAP sequence duplication in HIV-1 subtype C Gag p6 in drug-naive subjects of India and South Africa.BMC Infect. Dis. 2017; 17 (28118816): 9510.1186/s12879-017-2184-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sequence insertions of a greater length, especially in drug-naive subjects of HIV-1C, need a more logical and broader explanation. Martins et al. (15Martins A.N. Arruda M.B. Pires A.F. Tanuri A. Brindeiro R.M. Accumulation of P(T/S)AP late domain duplications in HIV type 1 subtypes B, C, and F derived from individuals failing ARV therapy and ARV drug-naive patients.AIDS Res. Hum.

Of note, the proposed gain-of-advantage due to PTAP duplication in drug resistance could be different in HIV-1C, as indeed a large proportion of primary viral isolates acquire a complete PTAP core motif duplication in the absence of ART administration (15Martins A.N. Arruda M.B. Pires A.F. Tanuri A. Brindeiro R.M.

The primary objective of this work was to address the importance of longer sequence insertion in p6 Gag that creates an additional PTAP motif in HIV-1C. The paucity of studies examining the biological significance of a higher frequency of insertions in the p6 Gag of HIV-1C further added to our interest in this study. In a longitudinal follow-up study of 3 years (2010–2013) of 65 HIV-1 seropositive subjects, we observed eight of 50 amplified viral sequences (16%) to contain a complete PTAP motif duplication. Using a range of experimental strategies, we demonstrate that PTAP duplication confers a profound replication advantage on the viral strains. We show further that HIV-1C Gag, as compared with that of HIV-1B, differs in the manner in which the"

The effective sulphonylurea concentration at its site of action is significantly attenuated by binding to serum albumin, which makes it difficult to compare in vitro and in vivo data. We therefore measured the ability of gliclazide and glibenclamide to inhibit KATP channels and stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of serum albumin. We used this data, together with estimates of free drug concentrations from binding studies, to predict the extent of sulphonylurea inhibition of KATP channels at therapeutic concentrations in vivo. KATP currents from mouse pancreatic β-cells and Xenopus oocytes were measured using the patch-clamp technique. Gliclazide and glibenclamide binding to human plasma were determined in spiked plasma samples using an ultrafiltration-mass spectrometry approach. Bovine serum albumin (60g/l) produced a mild, non-significant reduction of gliclazide block of KATP currents in pancreatic β-cells and Xenopus oocytes. In contrast, glibenclamide inhibition of recombinant KATP channels was dramatically suppressed by albumin (predicted free drug concentration <0.1%). Insulin secretion was also reduced. Free concentrations of gliclazide and glibenclamide in the presence of human plasma measured in binding experiments were 15% and 0.05%, respectively. Our data suggest the free concentration of glibenclamide in plasma is too low to account for the drug’s therapeutic effect. In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close KATP channels and stimulate insulin secretion."

The proof-of-concept HIV-CORE 003 clinical trial tested whether SAP depletion by CPHPC would enhance the immune response in human volunteers to DNA vaccination delivering the HIVconsv immunogen derived from conserved sub-protein regions of HIV-1.Human volunteers received 3 intramuscular immunizations with an experimental DNA vaccine (DDD) expressing HIV-1-derived immunogen HIVconsv, with or without prior depletion of SAP by CPHPC. All subjects were subsequently boosted by simian (chimpanzee) adenovirus (C)- and poxvirus MVA (M)-vectored vaccines delivering the same immunogen. After administration of each vaccine modality, the peak total magnitudes, kinetics, functionality and memory subsets of the T-cell responses to HIVconsv were thoroughly characterized.No differences were observed between the CPHPC treated and control groups in any of the multiple quantitative and qualitative parameters of the T-cell responses to HIVconsv, except that after SAP depletion, there was a statistically significantly greater breadth of T-cell specificities, that is the number of recognized epitopes, following the DDDC vaccination.The protocol used here for SAP depletion by CPHPC prior to DNA vaccination produced only a very modest suggestion of enhanced immunogenicity. Further studies will be required to determine whether SAP depletion might have a practical value in DNA vaccination for other plasmid backbones and/or immunogens.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02425241."

https://openalex.org/W2803255946,"Thirty-eight percent of US adult women are obese, meaning that more children are now born of overweight and obese mothers, leading to an increase in predisposition to several adult onset diseases. To explore this phenomenon, we developed a maternal obesity animal model by feeding mice a diet composed of high fat/ high sugar (HF/HS) and assessed both maternal diet and offspring diet on the development of endometrial cancer (ECa). We show that maternal diet by itself did not lead to ECa initiation in wildtype offspring of the C57Bl/6J mouse strain. While offspring fed a HF/HS post-weaning diet resulted in poor metabolic health and decreased uterine weight (regardless of maternal diet), it did not lead to ECa. We also investigated the effects of the maternal obesogenic diet on ECa development in a Diethylstilbestrol (DES) carcinogenesis mouse model. All mice injected with DES had reproductive tract lesions including decreased number of glands, condensed and hyalinized endometrial stroma, and fibrosis and increased collagen deposition that in some mice extended into the myometrium resulting in extensive disruption and loss of the inner and outer muscular layers. Fifty percent of DES mice that were exposed to maternal HF/HS diet developed several features indicative of the initial stages of carcinogenesis including focal glandular and atypical endometrial hyperplasia versus 0% of their Chow counterparts. There was an increase in phospho-Akt expression in DES mice exposed to maternal HF/HS diet, a regulator of persistent proliferation in the endometrium, and no difference in total Akt, phospho-PTEN and total PTEN expression. In summary, maternal HF/HS diet exposure induces endometrial hyperplasia and other precancerous phenotypes in mice treated with DES. This study suggests that maternal obesity alone is not sufficient for the development of ECa, but has an additive effect in the presence of a secondary insult such as DES."
https://openalex.org/W2803642125,"Although the development of effective therapeutic drugs and radical treatment options for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains urgent, progress in recent clinical trials of AD drugs has been less than adequate. In order to advance the progress of clinical trials, it is necessary to establish more efficient methods of recruitment. In Japan, there are registration systems stratified by mild cognitive impairment and preclinical and clinical stages of early and advanced stage dementia, but there is no registration system for healthy individuals yet. Therefore, in the present study, we developed a large-scale, internet-based health registry to investigate factors associated with cognitive function among registered participants. A total of 1038 participants completed the initial questionnaire and word list memory test. Among these participants, 353 individuals completed a second questionnaire and memory test. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 23.0 for Windows at a statistical significance level of p<0.05. We found that mood, motivation, and a decreased ability to perform activities of daily living were significantly associated with cognitive function. The results of the present study suggest that maintaining social involvement is important to prevent decreases in physical activity, daily function, mood, and motivation."

In this study we used Imaging Flow Cytometry (IFC) to analyze individual cells recovered from buccal, epidermal, and vaginal samples that had been dried between 24 hours and more than eight weeks. Measurements capturing the size, shape, and fluorescent properties of cells were collected in an automated manner and then used to build a multivariate statistical framework for differentiating cells based on tissue type. Results showed that epidermal cells could be distinguished from vaginal and buccal cells using a discriminant function analysis of IFC measurements with an average classification accuracy of ~94%. Ultimately, cellular measurements such as these, which can be obtained non-destructively, may provide probative information for many types of biological samples and complement results from standard genetic profiling techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2804635445,"Flightless saproxylic beetles were selected in order to study the impact of temporal and spatial discontinuity of forests. They were chosen because: (1) they are unable to fly, making them dispersal-limited species, (2) they have a saproxylic diet, which means they are closely linked to the forest, and (3), they have rarely been studied. Forest temporal continuity was expected to be the main factor explaining the presence of these species, modulated by the past and present amount of forest in the surrounding landscape. Twenty-seven forests, distributed into three zones, were sampled in southwestern France. Flightless saproxylic beetles were surveyed using a Winkler extractor and a Berlese funnel. Their presence/absence were modelled using generalised linear mixed models, with zone variable as random effect. Two species showed significant zone effect and were only or more present in the zone with the highest present forest amount in a 0.5 km radius. In the model that converged, the only selected variable was the past amount of forest in the landscape. The size of the forest, the presence of dead wood and the forest temporal continuity were not included in this model. The importance of the amount of forest in the landscape supports the hypothesis that dispersal-limited species are affected by landscape characteristics. This study demonstrates an important link between the presence of Dienerella clathrata and the amount of forest in the past, which led to an indicator species analysis being performed."
https://openalex.org/W2804847039,"Interactions between cells in the stroma and epithelium facilitate prostate stem cell activity and tissue regeneration capacity. Numerous molecular signal transduction pathways, including the induction of sonic hedgehog (Shh) to activate the Gli transcription factors, are known to mediate the cross-talk of these two cellular compartments. However, the details of how these signaling pathways regulate prostate stem and progenitor cell activity remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that, although cell-autonomous epithelial Shh-Gli signaling is essential to determine the expression levels of basal cell markers and the renewal potential of epithelial stem and progenitor cells, stromal Gli signaling regulates prostate stem and progenitor cell activity by increasing the number and size of prostate spheroids in vitro. Blockade of stromal Gli signaling also inhibited prostate tissue regeneration in vivo. The inhibition of stromal Gli signaling suppressed the differentiation of basal and progenitor cells to luminal cells and limited prostate tubule secretory capability. Additionally, stromal cells were able to compensate for the deficiency of epithelial Shh signaling in prostate tissue regeneration. Mechanistically, suppression of Gli signaling increased the signaling factor transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) in stromal cells. Elevation of exogenous TGFβ1 levels inhibited prostate spheroid formation, suggesting that a stromal Gli–TGFβ signaling axis regulates the activity of epithelial progenitor cells. Our study illustrates that Gli signaling regulates epithelial stem cell activity and renewal potential in both epithelial and stromal compartments.

https://openalex.org/W2803672842,"Computer science was born of a rebellious, hacker culture, a spirit that lives on in the publishing culture of artificial intelligence (AI). The burgeoning field is increasingly turning to conference publications and free, open-review websites while shunning traditional outlets—sentiments dramatically expressed in a growing boycott of a high-profile AI journal. As of 15 May, about 3000 people, mostly academic computer scientists, had signed a petition promising not to submit, review, or edit articles for Nature Machine Intelligence ( NMI ), a new journal from the publisher Springer Nature set to begin publication in January 2019. The petition, signed by many prominent researchers in AI, is more than just a call for open access. It decries not only closed-access, subscription-based journals such as NMI , but also author-fee publications: open-access journals that are free to read but require researchers to pay to publish. Instead the signatories call for more zero-cost open-access journals."
https://openalex.org/W2803646120,"On 21 May, China plans to launch a satellite with a vital but unglamorous mission. From a vantage point beyond the moon, Queqiao, as the satellite is called, will relay data from Chang9e 4, a lander and rover that is supposed to touch down on the lunar far side before the end of the year. But a Dutch-made radio receiver aboard Queqiao will attempt something more visionary. In the quiet lunar environment, it will listen to the cosmos at low frequencies that carry clues to the time a few hundred million years after the big bang, when clouds of neutral hydrogen were spawning the universe9s first stars. The mission is a proof of principle for other efforts to take radio astronomy above the atmosphere, which blocks key radio frequencies, and far from earthly interference. For Europe9s astronomers, it is also a test of cooperation with China, something their U.S. counterparts at NASA are barred from doing."
https://openalex.org/W2804626571,"The presence of standardised tools and methods to measure and represent accurately biological parts and functions is a prerequisite for successful metabolic engineering and crucial to understand and predict the behaviour of synthetic genetic circuits. Many synthetic gene networks are based on transcriptional circuits, thus information on transcriptional and translational activity is important for understanding and fine-tuning the synthetic function. To this end, we have developed a toolkit to analyse systematically the transcriptional and translational activity of a specific synthetic part in vivo. It is based on the plasmid pTRA and allows the assignment of specific transcriptional and translational outputs to the gene(s) of interest (GOI) and to compare different genetic setups. By this, the optimal combination of transcriptional strength and translational activity can be identified. The design is tested in a case study using the gene encoding the fluorescent mCherry protein as GOI. We show the intracellular dynamics of mRNA and protein formation and discuss the potential and shortcomings of the pTRA plasmid."
https://openalex.org/W2804724383,"For decades, some theoretical physicists have speculated that in the heart of a neutron star, a bizarre type of might emerge: a soup of the subatomic particles called quarks. Now, a new analysis indicates the recipe for such quark matter needs revision. Atomic nuclei consist of protons and neutrons, which themselves consist of trios of particles called up and down quarks, bound tightly by the strong nuclear force. Since the 1970s, some theorists have predicted that under extreme pressures like those in neutron stars, quarks might break free to create a soup of cold quark matter. They also predicted that it should include a third flavor of quarks known as strange quarks. Stable bits of such strange quark matter—or strangelets—might emerge in cosmic rays or linger from violent astrophysical events. Now, a trio of theorists argues that cold quark should consist of just up and down quarks. The analysis suggests that particle accelerators on Earth might just be able to produce stable bits of the quark matter. It would also dispel a far-fetched notion the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland could produce negatively charged strangelets that would gobble up positively charged atomic nuclei—a possibility already ruled out by cosmic ray observation. Up-down quark would definitively rule out the doomsday scenario, as it would be positively charged and repel atomic nuclei."

https://openalex.org/W2803231414,"About 1000 years ago, indigenous people built an elaborate network of great houses, kivas, and grand roads centered on Chaco Canyon, in the middle of the San Juan Basin of present-day New Mexico. Today, the region is one of the nation9s most productive oil and gas basins. It is also the setting of a collision between burgeoning energy development and archaeology. Taking advantage of advances in drilling technology, more than 4000 new wells may be developed in the area in the coming years. Meanwhile, advances in remote sensing are revealing hundreds of previously unknown roads between Puebloan sites. As companies scrape well pads and access roads from the high desert scrub, archaeologists fear they will erase ancient roads before they have been fully studied—or even detected."
